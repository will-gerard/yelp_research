I had a craving for ice cream so tried this. The girl at the counter was seating people, taking orders, cashier in and making ice cream...even though  other people  were working!  So my ice cream was scooped then sat on the counter melting while she helped others, came back, served it to me seriously  half melted! She wss frazzled, I feel for her, but it was dissapointing! I added a pic of the mustard bottle, soooo disgusting and they were all like  that! Cool cuz it is a real old soda counter, but it could be sooooo much better! I  wish it was a cool blast from the past with a soda Jerk in a sharp uniform, but instead there  is a guy in pants and shirt too big for him! Great idea, but cleanliness is not a thing here at all! Great concept, could be a good moneymaker, oh well!

I have gone to this true dive bar many times, but will not be back! The Friday night bartender was great but she quit! The Karaoke  host Thom, who was awesome,  had all the best songs and was nice is gone now too! The ceiling is falling off in chunks  in the back room around the evap cooler, the bathroom floor is often wet and smells funky. The only food available is a couple things in a vending machine and Tony ' s frozen  pizza which they microwave  for you. I have seen bar fights where police have been called and a few other things I would rather not have seen! Let me just say that without the great karaoke and good bartender, there is absolutely  no reason  to go! You probably  couldn't  find it, the tree in front of the sign keeps it pretty hidden!  If I  could give it a 1/2 star or none I would!

I don't know when Meredith was here, but I have been here a few times and it is never what I would call clean! There is always stuff all over the floor, many machines not working and NO STAFF here to clean or fix things! There ae a lot of big front load machines, which is why I am here... that and it is close! The 5 load machine is $4.25, 3 load is $3.25. I consider this to be a high estimation. I would only put 3 small or 2 large loads in the 5 load machine. The dryers are 25 cents for 8 minutes. They are not real hot so towels will cost at least a dollar,  sheets 50 cents. This is a place you better watch your stuff, just sayin'.

I like breakfast here! Apple cider in a frosty mug or hot chocolate.  Yummy Applewood bacon, delicious biscuits, hot from the oven! What's not to love!? The have delicious sweet tea and sugar ham as well!  The staff is always friendly! ! Did I mention the store where you can buy candy, syrup, jam, toys, clithes, holiday decorations and cd's!? They pack a lot into the space available! ! They are all over the U.S, which is nice when traveling to be able to go to a place where you can get home style food at a reasonable price, although prices have gone up quite a bit in the last few years, it is still less expensive than many places.  I will be back!

Went in today for a nail polish application,  had no polish on. Having never been here,this was my testrun... never agsin! An older man sits at the entrance, has you write your name down, the next available  person checks the list. This is a very small salon with pedicure chairs along one wall and 3 rows of 3 wide manicure stations in the opposite  corner, very close together. She told me to sit down before the last woman was gone and  began to file my nails on the same towel she had used for the last person, this didn't  seem to bother the women  on either side of me! I have a sensitive left shoulder and right elbow from a car accident.  She kept pulling and her king my arm, twisting my fingers, it was very uncomfortable! ! I get manicures regularly  but was not able to go to my regular salon today, never again!  I will go without!! I also don't  like a snide thanks when I have tipped 25%, in a restaurant  that is very good,  don't  hurt me I would tip more!!

I have been going to this Manuel's since 1983! My baby ate cheese crisp & green corn tamales in the high chair there. Guess what, still goes there for the same! The green corn tamales haven't changed in all these years, still great. The sampler platter is awesome. The margaritas are good, not watered down like some places! I love the chicken chimis, seasoned wonderfully, not just meat in a tortilla, like many places! The flan is YUMMY! So are the sopapillas!! The decor is "vintage mexican restaurant" with thick leather booths and hanging plants. There is a bar in the restaurant area with sports on the tvs and a full separate bar called Tiajuana Tilly's.he parking can be touch on Friday & Sat night. Monday night in the restuarant they have 1/2 price margaritas and Tuesday is kids eat FREE night- I think? Mine are grown. They had this busboy 20 years ago that we dubbed "The World's Greatest Busboy" because he could work the whole dining room and you never wanted for anything! He ws AMAZING! I hear he is a maitre d' in Phoenix now. But, never fear they have a fantastic waiter- Luis. We only go when he is working, so if you go, tell him Desertdoll sent you! He will take good care of you! and live a little, get the green corn tamale!

I always went to the Sweet Tomatoes on Indian Bend, then the one on Camelback, it closed, so I went to Metro Center, it was ok, I went back to Indian Bend, it was good...then I went to Tempe! Look no further! I have found my favorite!! The Tempe location has been here for years but was remodeled about 1 1/2 years ago, according to staff. It is much nicer, comfy, warm and welcoming inside. There are glass hanging planters. There are glass jars on the table with fresh rosemary speigs. They have glass glasses! They serve beer and wine along with all your Sweet Tomatoes favorites. Allie was super friendly and really hustled to keep the dining room clean. She answered questions about the company and was very knowledgeable. All my favs, Tomato soup, wonton salad, rosemary focacia, a yummy salad with spinach, beets, etc!  The only reason it is 4 instead of 5 stars is that they don't bring around the hot chocolate chip cookies anymore and the chocolate muffins were real dry! I will go back!!

I have been eating at Manuel's for, well let's just say a LONG time! I used to go to the one on Broadway until it closed. When I lived out of state I ALWAYS stopped at Manuel's on visits!   As the New Times has announced, they have the best salsa! I know there are various tastes out there and everyone is entitled to their opinion, but mine is that I like their salsa best, the margaritas, the cheese crisp, the fajitas, wait- it gets better... in N CAL, MI and IL I couldn't find a green corn tamale to save my life, so I learned how to make them and I will say I make them well! But, they are a lot of work and so I am happy to be back in the Valley of the Sun to get them at Manuel's! I prefer their chicken chimis to any place I have been because they actually season it nicely, not just chicken in a deep fried tortilla! The guac is great! Not made with a ton of jalapenos or strange ingredients! The flan is the best I have had! The sopapillas are little now, I kind of like the bigger squares, but they still taste good!  Now, let me tell you about the service! They have some of the greatest staff- Luis, Marcos, Jerry, Carlos, these guys are the BEST!!!!  Well, I will say that the Indian School location has some problems, the flan is curdly and there were a couple other differences, including service. I don't know why this is, but I just go to the one on Southern that I know will be great!  All in all this is the only place I like to go for Mexican food. I have tried a great many here and in other states and I always go back to my favorite, Manuel's! Maybe I'll see you there sometime!

I rented from the Fairfield CA location @1425 W Texas St on 8/9/2006. I reserved online a 26' truck. I had to drive 30 miles, past 6 closer locations to go to this one because that was where the 26' truck was supposedly at a cost of $982.48. When we got there it was a 24' truck. We were moving out of state and had everything ready to go & people at the house to load it, no time for changes. So we took it, not everything fit! Their own paperwork says they may sub LARGER but not smaller! The truck had a gas engine w/ 202,000 miles on it and it was August. we were driving from Napa CA to Tempe AZ. Now you tell me if this is a disaster waiting to happen! The a/c went out in Blythe CA. We drove to Quartzite with no a/c and it was too hot, partly because VERY hot air was blowing out on my legs. Now, we had to get to AZ because had to pick up a family member flying in to the  Phoenix airport that afternoon. So, we called U-Haul and talked to various people. Their plan was for us to turn around and go back to Blythe for repair- it would be the next day at least, probably longer. Now, I am not going to pay for gas and hotel while they fix a truck that they shouldn't have given us in the first place. So, we drove on and got to our hotel in AZ. As soon as I walked in the hotel Asst manager said" Oh my gosh! let me get you some water". My face was bright red from the heat. Oh, that is the Airport Hilton, they are great. So, when we got to AZ they told us to take the truck to this location on Priest. It is their service center. They supposedly fixed it while we had to sit and wait because we had no other vehicle in town yet. When they were done (2 hours later) we drove back to the hotel. When we left 1/2 hour later, the a/c was out again! We ended up unloading and driving it back to them with no a/c and temps well oer 110 degrees! Turns out that in the 2 hours they had it they just charged with freon, nnot fixing it like they should have. It needed a new compressor. So, all in all U-HAUL sucks! besides they reservation process won't let you chose a location, they call you the day before and tell you where to pick-up. I used Penske before this and will ever since this, they are much better!!! Oh yeah, they wanted us to make full payment. I went to my credit card company and after MANY phone calls, ended up after all of this having to pay them $736.86. Not much of a discount for causing us so much trouble, stress and health issues for me from heat exhaustion. I was very sick.  Please think before using them! Penske is much better.

Hearty portions of home coookin' meals! I always get the turkey dinner, but have tasted the lasagna and spaghetti & meatballs,  both good. The warm, homemade bread is yummy and the pie, which I never have room for is huge! A slice is a 1/4 of a pie!

We like the large choice of veggies for salad. I do wish that there was a little more chicken or something for protein. The soups are decent for buffet, I do not like unpeeled potatoes in them, but I do like the tomato basil. The iced tea is good- large choice of drinks. Soft serve ice cream, muffins, fruit and pudding for dessert. Good for groups and when you want to load on veg!

Food is average but pricey. Been before, this time asked for a quiet table then a kid who kept scrwaming, kicking seat and running  around was seated  behind us. Birthday,  can't  use free sundae coupon with 20% off, they will sing to you, but no free dessert,  soooo not birthday  worthy!!!

Ambiance: I enjoy sitting on the patio in the evening here. With all the hard surfaces inside and the tvs it can get pretty loud inside, but it is much quieter inside. It is interesting to see all the beer brewing equipment, sort of like a little field trip :) Parking: Now this is the one drawback! Parking is at a premium! Be prepared to walk a little way. Staff: I have always had good experiences. Most of the staff have been college students and while maybe not the most experienced they are friendly and helpful. Food: The food has always been good and good portions for the price. Beer: Now this is what we all REALLY go there for! They have their regular brews and seasonal brews. My favorite by far, is KILTLIFTER!! Man, it is good!! So, go...what are you waiting for?? Great spot for after the ASU game or what have you.

Wow, I do not get why so many people like this place unless they like it because it is ethnic and different. I went with a group of friends, some of whom are vegetarian. We had 3 children with us. It is in a strip mall on University. It has very basic decorating. The owner was our waiter, his wife was in the restaurant and so was his child who ran around the whole time. We ordered 2 of the large assortment platters where you get a scoop of everything. We ordered injera bread and various drinks. I frankly felt overcharged for scoops of food that were CLEARLY not freshly prepared but froma steam table. Who knows when it was prepared! Sorry if you do not agree but food from a steam table is not worhty of the price they charge. I will not go back again. This is not the first Ethiopian restaurant we have been to and not the best.

I have only had take-out while at work from here. I would never go there to eat. What is the deal with the giant bread? I can never order anything hot because it won't be when I get it. I kow a lot of people like it and maybe it is what they order and what I order, but I just have NEVER liked anything I have gotten from this place!

This is a Mill Avenue classic! They brought the bar from Ireland, you really feel like you are ina traditional pub in here. There is a large outdoor patio with fulll bar for smokers and on those lovely nights. They have heaters. Inside there is a large bar and a dining room with an eclectic assortment of tables.  FOOD and drink: They have a number of traditional dishes, but I am sorry to say that noe have been outstanding enough to make me come back for the food. But, they do have Smithwick's and many other great beers and whiskeys so come in for a drink and live music. They have different music each night, always something fun!

I have eaten at Haji's many times. The handmade pita is wonderful and the food is usually good. We have gotten the chicken shwarma, hummus, mixed paltter, gyros, olives, baklava, falafal, etc, etc. The thing that is a drawback for me is, well a couple: It is a restaurant on one side and grocery market on the otehr stide. The market is often cluttered and I am not overwhelmed by cleanliness. The other thing that really bothered me was the large jars of olives for people to serve themselves. I saw a guy reach into each of them with his hands and taste one from each jar. When I said something to him, he told me it was fine and basically blew me off. I thought it was disgusting and so I do NOT eat the olives! I have since taught myself to make a lot of my favorite dishes, but still love the bread. As far as handicap accessibility, I would have to look again, I know you must step up from the parking onto the sidewalk curb.  Update, I went there a couple weeks ago and everything was hot or cold as it should be and delicious!!!!! Yum, I am ready to go back!!!

I found an old roll of 110 film and took it to Tempe Camera to see if they could develope it for me. I had already tried Costco. To my surprise and delight they said they could. The price was reasonable and the photos we very nice. I was very pleased and would definately go to them for other needs.

Eh! This is a very busy place because it is large and in Cave Creek, but I have to say, I have given this 2 try and won't go back! The service is very slow and the food was basically on the level of bar food! Mediocre at best! Maybe I didn't order the right thing, but I asked the server what was good, she said everything.  Oh well, you can't win them all!

A trip in a time machine! An old school, classic, classy Phoenix  dining experience! Love the semi-circle booths, great wallpaper, huge pots of flowers and candles. We went for lunch, I had a dinner salad and the open-faced roast beef sandwich, thick sliced. I don't  eat the bread, so this was great! I also got sweet potato  fries instead  of the garlic  mashed potatoes.  They fries are crinkle cut and ok, but the skinny fries at Vig and Red Robin are better. I had veg- carrots, zucchini& cauliflower,  they were plain and boring, but we were served a small round loaf of bread that was delicious, it was served with a melted butter/garlic/herb/leek mixture poured over it, YUM!! I dipped the veg in it and wahla, awesome!  My lunch mate had the French dip sandwich, it was huge and perfect! We ordered the trio of creme brule- mixed berry, Baileys  and chocolate,  if you are a creme brule lover like me,  skip it...I was very disappointed.  They were  ok, but $9, very  small and flavor, eh! Our waiter was very nice and accommodating! I must say the hostess was a total idiot! We were the only people in the dining room in a booth, we were  ordering dessert and a second couple came in. They were seated at the table in front of us, facing us, it was like having dinner together!  Facing each other, so close we could hear each other essily. Really, only an idiot would do that. It is NOT about convenience of staff, it is about comfort guests! Especially  at these prices! 2 dandwiches, 1 orange juice, 1 wine, 1 dessert,all in the lower price  range was $74, could have been much more.  Was  it worth that much, not really for the total experience. But had to do it once.

We have ordered from this location many times, then go and pick up. It is usually just coming out of the oven when we get there. If it is out, it is in the warming oven. This time it was up front under a heat lamp and not hot at all. For $18.00 for 1 pizza with pepperoni, I was NOT happy. It is a very mediocre pizza anyway!No apology or offer to discount or anything! I WILL NOT go back here again!

If you like sports, good food or cold drinks, go here! This is a multi-room place. There is a room with booths and carpet for quieter dining, the bar area, a dining area next to that with booths and tables and an area in back with high top granite tables for off-track betting. There is a lot of wood for a classyfeel. There is a juke box for constant usic and so many tv's I lost count!! They have live music on Fridays from 5-9pm, always something great...even some Hall-of-fame-performers. On Saturday nights from 5-9 they have karaoke, but this karaoke is cool because he has 10's of thousands of songs old to current, if he doesn't have your song he can download it!! There is a very nice  patio if you like to enjoy our fabulous weather! The live music is on the patio.  The wings are delicious and there are a lot of choices. The burgers are big and juicy! The menu is big with something for everyone. There is a happy hour menu and late night specials. The iced tea is freshbrewed, the beer is cold, the cocktails are yummy - thanks Erin! The managers a Ben and Jake are great! They work hard and run a great place. So, get out to Gallagher's,  do it on Sat or Fri for entertainment with your food!!

Going there now for injuries.  Very nice facility and staff. The heat is lovely, but more massage would be awesome, that is what loosens those tight muscles to retrain them and releases all that nasty stuff.well, one can hope!

My last review was while I was a patient and I didn't  want my true review to cause my treatment  to be worse! I went there for months without improvement.  The would have me lay on heat, then do little exercise that I could do at home, because they make more  money  the longer your visit,  then use ice, each thing is a charge. At one point I asked the therapist, Older guy named Richard, why he didn't  do massage as I knew it would help immensely  wirh my injuries, he told me insurance did not allow them to do massage. I then witnessed other therapists using massage  on patients. I also witnessed a Richard use a to well on which he had sprayed the ad pray they use to wipe down the equipment when he was touching another patient. So, he evidently has a touch phobia  or something,  so why is he a physical  therapist!  He was more interested in bragging about who he had worked  on than my healing! I ended up switching to the office manager, also a therapist.  I eventually left this office after months and went to Tim Ferron, my improvement there was far superior  and faster.  I would never recommend  Physiotherapy  Associates!  My recuperation  from my car accident  too much longer than it should have, do infuriating! !

I was really excited to hear about this place but when I went there I was disappointed. I was hoping for a really nice tea room or a cute little boho place. This was neither. It was hard surfaces and dank. I looked at the selection and didn't see anything that excited me- I have an really good selection at home. So...I went home and brewed myself a cup for a LOT less money.

WOW! The Pa-lat-zo! I have been to Vegas many, many times. I have stayed in many of the various hotels. I have to say this is the one I would go back to! Kyle was our check-in clerk and he is the greatest! He made us feel so welcome! I requested a quiet room with a view of the strip and that all the down items be removed from my room because I am very allergic. By the time I got to my room the staff was just finishing changing the room so I didn't have to sit in there with the down-getting sick-hooray! That NEVER happens! Our room looked out over the strip and we had a birds-eye view of the pirate fight at Treasure Island across the street. The room was beautiful as you can see from pics on the site. The first night we went to the dueling piano bar because we just wanted to relax. There were 2 different pairs of pianists. They were great fun. The cocktail waitress was so friendly and professional. The drinks were all made perfectly-yeah! We went to Phantom and enjoyed that immensly. We have seen it in San Francisco, but this one is different. They have cut a little, but none of the songs and nothing so that the story flow is changed. The appearance of being in the Paris Opera house is so cool! Very fun! The ONLY issue that came up in our whole stay was getting different answers from different ticket agents, but we got great seats so it is fine! The marble in the bathrooms is beautiful, everything is always SPOTLESS, the staff is so welcoming and kind. I simply enjoyed myself so much I didn't want to leave!!!  The Palzzo and the Venetian are joined by the Grand Canal and Casinos. There is a shopping mall on the second level. They have 3 Mario Batallia restaurants, 2 Emeril Lagasse,  and numerous others.  Any cuisine, any price range, there is even a food court next to the casino for those who don't want their slot machine to cool off :) They have the BEST gelato! The selection is AMAZING!!! I love-a the spumoni!!  We ate at LAVO and Grand Lux-from the people who own CHeesecake Factory. Those are seperate reviews.

Took my beautiful daughter there for happy hour. I have been there before for dinner with my hubby and wasn't too impressed, but it was her choice. So, we sat in the bar at a high top table. One of the main things we like about Lucille's is the funky/retro decor. It is really cool. We would love to have a room like the one with the rattan furniture- my grand aunt DID have one like it with a canary too!   I got a Joe's hurricane, it was good. Our waiter, who was also the bartender brought us biscuits. The are good, but not great. They are served with a cinnamon butter, no honey or plain butter, but you can probably ask for some. We ordered a side of veggies which were wonderful! They were green beans, red bell pepper, onion, etc cooked to perfection in a nice butter sauce. They were not rubbery or too crisp, not mushy either, just right! We also got sweet potato fries which came with a garlic mayo, I am not a fan of mayo so opted for the ranch dressing on some or just plain- I like them that way.  The 2 items we got were good, but I am not a fan of their BBQ sauces so would not go there for BBQ.

Yummy! This is my favorite fast Greek restaurant.  The food is very fresh, delicious and reasonably priced! I have eaten the Greek salad with and without chicken- the cheese they use is the best!!  I like the kabovs, gyros, falafel,  span a Kopitar and, of course,  the baklava! The staff is very nice! They have drive-thru if you are in a hurry, a dining room, but I like the little patio! They have authentic Greek music playing. .. it is like a mini vacation! Seriously,  if you like Greek food, you have to try this.

I never knew this place was where it is until I saw it on YELP! You can't really see it from Apache. It is tucked in behind Eddie's Pizza, a tiny Fillabertos, next to Planned Parenthood.  The reviews on here were so high I had to check it out. I love frozen yogurt, ice cream and especially gelato. Well...... the owners everyone speaks so highly about were not there. It was Sunday andw e got there at 250pm and had to hang around, they don't open until 3pm.  The guy who was working was very friendly and helpful. I have to say as a self-proclaimed gelato fanatic I was dissappointed. They didn't have any of the great traditional flavors. I ended up getting no sugar added chocolate which was good and blueberry sorbet, wich I also enjoyed. But, I wish they had a larger selection. The best place I have found in Tempe or Mesa is Angel Sweet at Riverview, but I am now going to venture West and see what Phoenix has to offer.

Life is too short to eat bad bbq...or so the t-shirt said. Well, I am a bbq lover and I have a favorite place, this is it, unless I am in NC. I have my favorite servers, so I eat in the bar 99% of the time, Tom and Chenin are the best! Friendly and fun are the order of the day with these 2! Tom always remembers what I like and it comes out perfect every time because he makes sure it does, did I mention, he rides a motorcycle, how is that for cool! Brando works there too, Marlon Brando, no but he is a hard working guy, very friendly too. Kathy is in the dining room and she is great!! Everyone wants to make sure you are happy, FULL and coming back to see them again. Your meal starts with a bowl of homemade potato chips to enjoy tasting all the sauces, 5 of them. I like the Texas Pit on the chips and Sweet & Zesty on my meat. They also have their award winning Rich & Sassy, Georgia Mustard an the Devil's Spit for those brave souls who like some fire! I really like the ribs, the Pineapple Rage wings- sweet and hot, and the bbq chopped salad with beef brisket. The mac and cheese hasj alapeno in it, not for the babies! The Wilbur beans (named after the mascot) are delicious! You get a delicious corn muffin with every meal, it is their secret recipe and they are adictive!, if you have room for dessert, which I very rarely do, they have bread pudding, banana pudding,  a sundae or Kahlua brownie sundae- yum!!

Well, I really like this place but it has fantastic days and ok days! Today was an ok day!  I had a dinner salad with romaine lettuce, which sometimes is green and delicious but today was all the stem ends-WHITE, which means practically no nutrition compared to the general and less appetizing! I also ordered the happy hour regular chicken wings with sweet and zesty sauce. The picture on the happy hour menu shows a basket with about 8-10 wings, but I got a plate with 4 1/2 wings, one was literally cut in half! The sauce was definitely pineapple rage, which I like so I ate them. The wings cost $4.00, so I don't consider that a happy hour deal and false advertising,  misleading menu. The bartender Chenin was great as always, she was a bright spot in a dismal day!

Eh, I won't  go back ! I wanted to eat on the patio, but it was full. Service  was good- Felicity, but food, not so much!  Eggs were right, bacon- asked for extra crisp, it was limp and super  greasy. I ordered a waffle, been craving, soooooo disappointed!  It was very heavy and dense, tastless... not worth the calories!  The French Toast my dining partner got tasted  much better and it was  a large serving! Oh well, cross it off the list!

I always enjoy eating here, simple, good down - home food! Breakfast is my favorite.  There are some misses once in a while in the kitchen or staff at every location  I have been to, but in general... I  love the sweet tea, but get 1/2 & 1/2 so I don't  have too much sugar. The bacon and bisquits are my favorite,  anything else is a bonus and yummy! They have the best green beans if you are there for lunch or dinner.  Waiting for a table? They have a country store full of candy, candles, clothes for all ages, toys, household decor and books on tape that you can rent to listen to while you travel, very cool idea!  I know I love the nostalgia of it too!

I  have been to many locations in various states, it used to be a favorite  restaurant  but this is the last visit. It has changed  since being sold and in my opinion, not for the better!  The garlic bread was a half of a round loaf with slices of garlic on it cut into wedges, now it is just slices of bread with garlic  butter.  Our evening started off fine, we sat in the bar in hopes of watching  the Cardinals  game, it wasn't  on but we asked a manager  and he changed it.  Our server, Helena was attentive, but a bit too familiar, calling everyone Loves, Honey etc I feel this is unprofessional  and it is uncomfortable. She wss  bringing our carafe of red sangria which was full of ice, too sour from the citrus and knowing  how much I can drink and feel it-1 glass of wine, i assume it was not much alcohol! We had 2 cups of minestrone and the packages of saltiness stunk horribly! We gave them to the server, she never brought more!  The two managers, bartenders and some servers decided to loudly argue about shifts and performance  in the bar, in front of everyone  at this time! Very unprofessional!   We were still eating  our soup, which was hot but average, when the pepperoni pizza and baked rigatoni arrived. The pizza was very greasy. The rigatoni could have had more cheese and sausage for the price!!  At this point we were eating,  a couple tables got up and left, including the one next to us who ordered a salad and green beans only,  then complained that their salad was too small to be a large and they would only pay for a small, so the manager fawned all over them! Helena  was AWOL!  The bartender was sloping buckets of water from the mop bucket onto the floor with the  sanibucket, a bit nasty!  We stopped eating  and still no Helena,  a minimum of 15 minutes, I think more, we were done, needing our food wrapped and our check! She seemed to be very grumpy, maybe the manager  yelled  at her about the salad!  She took the pizza to wtap, didn't  come back, didn't  come back... we were going to get dessert  but decided not to! She finally  came back, packaged  the rigatoni and brought the check.  Neither manager EVER said Hello, mentioned the horrible,  stinky crackers, etc! As we left, the bartender seemed frustrated.. I think the earlier conversation  and whatever went on in the kitchen  rolled over into the dining room, spoiling our experience, which is very bad management!   The food is not as good as it used to be and with the change in the garlic bread and getting rid of the Sambuca chocolate  sauce, there is no reason  to go back!

Dutch Bros is GREAT! Very friendly, helpful and accomodating staff! COUPONS! Drive thru convenience! Did I mention the COUPONS! They have a walk-up window to accomodate all the walkers on the way to and from campus or if you just love to get out of your car and stroll up to the window. They have more than just coffee, they have great hot chocolate and even spiced cider as well as a number of iced drinks, oh and SNACKS! Did I mention the COUPONS and punchcards?

Stole my sheets! If I  could give this a negative  rate I would! I had sheets that were not dry when everything  else was, got distracted by an urgent phone call, gathered what was dry and left. I forgot my sheets in the dryer. I asked the wom as n working there, cleaning if she had seen them, put them in lost and found. She started for the office then stopped. She told me she had seen them when she came in to work, so if no one was there, they should have been put in lost and found. She said, no, called someone speaking Spanish,  then told me to call Police, pointed to the sign saying not responsible.  She then said if items are left at closing  they are put in the office, funny why were mine still in the dryer when she opened then and what did she do wirh them? I  guess she liked my nice new aheets! I am so upaet, I know she is lying and when I called the office twice you get a recording and no call back! This is as lso a coin less laundry so sometimes the card is deducted on a machine th a T doesn't  work and they don't  do refunds. Perfect! Can't  wait to have my own machine again!

I went to Mojo a couple weeks ago. I have always been a big frozen yogurt fan. I was disappointed in the selection of flavors. While they had about 8 flavors, there wasn't much that appealed to me- loking for something out there and fruity. Also, when I did get the chocolate it came out partially frozen-not normal, clumps. Anyway the clerk said it wasn't normal, machine wasn't working right, but charged me full rpice- which isn't cheap! So, I won't go back.

Cleanliness: It could have used a sweep and wipe when I was in there and it was only moderately busy- no line. Food: The selection at this place was not stellar! I really like frozen yogurt, but the flavor selection while good in number was not too appealing in flavor. I also had a repeat of what happened at Mojo with the fast meltdown. I think they need to set the freeze level higher. Just not worth the time and money for another stop.

We had never seen this place and were actually driving around the block to park and eat at Jimmy Woo's, serendipity took over and we went here instead. The North side door says "Welcome" above it but is locked. Go to the East side entrance to get in. You enter into a sort of courtyard sidewalk. The main restaurant is on the right while there are 2 little tables and 2 benches outside and to the left are 2 overflow rooms that were not being used.  A man brought us drinks after a while, but we sat there for at least 15 more minutes before someone took our order. We were there for lunch. We both got a large bowl of soup that was similar to egg drop. It had the egg white in it and had quite a bite of white pepper. It was piping hot and tasted good.   My hubby ordered the Pad Thai, medium. It was a nice spice level, although he can take it hotter. I tasted it and the noodles were cooked nicely. He enjoyed it. I ordered the Thai Basil chicken mild- I like some spice but not too much. It was not spicy at all. It comes with white rice with black sesame seeds on top which was a nice touch. There is a small green salad with a peanut dressing that was tasty. There was a fried wonton and a small "eggroll". One bit of the eggroll was all I was going to eat. It tasted like rancid oil- I was really surprised and disappointed. My main dish had chicken, a lot of bamboo shoots and onion and a few sprigs of basil. It had a nice sauce and was quite tasty. I was enjoying it until about 2/3's of the way through I hit a sharp rib bone! It had been cut so it had a VERY sharp point. Very dangerous!  We had to ask for sauce for the eggrolls and there were no other condiments brought to the table or on the table. I noticed others mentioned that, guess you had a different server. After eatting we waited a very long time for our check. I will say that when I showed him the bone and explained that it was in my food and was dangerous he took my meal off the bill. But, it took about 2 hours to have LUNCH and with the bone and funky eggroll I will absolutely not go back!

The best dive bar in Phoenix! Live music most nights of the week and NO COVER!!! Wow! Great bartenders, friendly and they know how to make your drink right. Popcorn and other bar food available. ON busy nights they have Chi-Town dogs there. Like my facebook page www.facebook.com/spectacularentertainmentaz to see some of the great shows happening there.

I went here with some friends. We had a great time, lots of laughs! The owner, Howard Hughes did a bit and is funny guy, but all the acts kept us chuckling! Our waitress, Christina was AWESOME! She recommended the house special cocktail-Blue Balls, it was a hit! We will be back! When you go, ask to sit in het section, no waiting, dying of thirst and service with a smile!

I will begin by saying I  did not have high hopes because a previous experience  at PV location  left much to be desired,  but I am happy to report  this location  is great! I had a gash on my sidewall so needed a new tire...I have only had the car 6 months, new tires, did not anticipate  this! Fletcher's  had the best price, no one had it in stock (high performance  tire) but they could get it the next day instead of a week! The manager, Cory Hague checked me in when I got there, quoted me 30-40 minutes. After 40 minutes I went to check on it, he was out there doing it himself! He didn't  want to go over the time he quoted! So, $180 later, I an say I will go back. Thank you Cory, it was a hot day!!!

Consistent,  yummy, drive-thru, coupons! Really, this is all I need to know! They have all my favorite, old-school donuts!! Chocolate long john's, Chocolate cake with chocolate frosting, custard filed chocolate frosted, apple fritter and then get have many, many more. They have all kinds of drinks and breakfast sandwiches too, in case you want to be semi-healthy!  On the North side if Indian school. You can go in, but I just hit the drive-thru.   The coupons come to the house for half dozen free with a dozen. They are already s better deal than most places and taste better!!  Dang, now I'm craving a donut!

First time to this location, no better than the other one I went to. We sat at a pub table near the wall- small so not a lot of good seating, the bar was full of a group who knew each other. We ordered drinks and happy hour mozzarella- the mozzarella was very good, the tea- average. We ordered minestrone soup- it came out when we had our first bite of our appetizer so I asked them to hold on the pizza so we could catch up, but no... it came out after a couple more bites, so we had all 3 courses on the table, getting cold and feeling rushed. The soup had large noodles, a mishmash of veggies- never seen peas in it and thin slices of sausage. It was not very flavorful and I was not impressed. The pizza was ok-not thrilling, very small for $16.00!!  A solo musician was coming in to start playing as we were finishing- of course! I will not be back!

WEDNESDAY & THURSDAY nights are KARAOKE nights from 8pm- close. The Host - Thom is the greatest! He has the biggest song list I have seen in any local bar! I heard it is over 13,500! He has a bunch of recently added songs! Wow! He makes it fun and everyone there is so nice. No need to be shy here, everyone is friendly! Drink specials all night and great food too! Get in here Wednesday & Thursday night and sing, drink and be merry! It is the most fun you can have with a microphone! UPDATE! The bar has been closed and I do not know what entertainment they have any more!

I don't  know about their grout work b ut I do know that as one of their trucks pulling a trailer  East on the 202 this morning drove along, he was on the inside lane pulling this trailer at or near 80 mph, breaking the law, being rude and being a jerk!!

Went for lunch yesterday,  was at the end of the lunch hour so we were offered a seat in the sun on the patio, i asked to wait for one in the shade, a majority  of the empty tables were dirty. Our server was very friendly and brought our iced tea, it was passion not plain,  i guess that is all they have, it was good. I got the 1/2 pizza and salad for $10.50- chopped salad and a pizza  with sausage, peppers, mushrooms,  olives, etc. I was asked if I wanted grated parmesan, i said Yes! I got 2 quick grates and she was gone- a little more would be perfect. .. she held the cheese in her bare hand, which I think would be against  health code. The pizza  was good as was the salad except  that there was blue cheese in it! Many people wouldn't  mind, for me, it is a problem,  I  am allergic! ! I had already taken a bite into a chunk and swallowed,  not to spit on my plate or cloth napkin, which is what I should have done because I have been on meds since and I have spent all morning  in bed today! It was NOT supposed to be in the salad, i double checked,  so that is just a sloppy kitchen, where things are carelessly  handled and food made! I told the server, but no response  was forthcoming, most restaurants would have a manager  talk to you. Between  that snd the fact that they are owned by Postino, I will never go back because  I  produce  a charity benefit for homeless  veterans  every year. I went to Posting Arcadia  and asked for a donation for the raffle,  they told me to come back, I did, they said  no. I do all of this on my own time and gas!. So, when other businesses  in the area support the benefit taking place in their neighborhood  to raise money for AZ StandDown /homeless veterans,  like The Vig. Teepee Mexican, Z Greek and more... but places like Postino, Beckett ' s Table and Acacia don't,  I  feel I must support  the places that feel veterans are important  and their customers  being sick from their sloppy and careless handling of the food means something  to them!!!

If I could give the 0 or Negative stars I would! They tell you anything to get you to sign up, then say they didn't say that! It took numerous calls and starting all over 3 times to place the order, then 3 visits to get the correct equipment and have it installed correctly! Completely absurd! As you can see from other reviews, I am not alone! I do not know how they stay in business! I also asked specifically, since I was renting, if I moved before the contract period was over and I could not have their service there would that be a problem, they told me "of course not!"! I did move to a location where I cannot use their service and they are now trying to collect the balance, sending me to collections. Why would I pay for something I am not using, cannot use and was told I would not have to deal with! Angry, frustrated and kind of sad that the ethics of this company are so below a decent standard that it is sickening!

I got new tires on my car in Mar, a week ago I went in for a rotation and the front tires were worn down to the steel bands on the front tires, YIKES! I got 2 new tires at Discount Tire on Indian Bend and the 101. They suggested I go to Carlife around the corner for an alignment. That sounded logical, they even gave me coo-pun! Took the car in, they said I needed the alignment, a camber kit (adjustment for the alignment), new struts and strut mounts and maybe more once they got in there.   Here is where it gets interesting. Knowing that I had just had new struts 6 months ago and they last for at least 50,000 I took it to Olson's Care Care in Mesa. They told me I needed an alignment and camber kit. So...I went back to Carlife and asked them why I needed new struts and strut mounts. The owner, Eddie said he didn't know he is just the owner and does desk work, I needed to talk to Hank, the mechanic. Hank took me on a test drive so I could hear the squeek/noise that made him sure I needed struts and mounts. I heard a very slight noise. I told him that I recently replaced them. He told me they could be defective. I said then they would be leaking right? He agreed. He put it on the rack and could not find any leaking. He basically failed to prove to me why I needed to spend over $900!!!   I then went back to my friend who had installed the struts and done other work. I told him what happened while we were on a test drive, trying to make it work. It was a hot day and I guess that made it not so easy to replicate. When we got back he got out, went to the front passenger side and pushed down, there was the sound. He said that is your spring, which is EXACTLY what it sounded like. No big deal. Just get the alignment.   I went back to Olson's Car Care, got the alignment and get what, for a couple hundred my car drives like a new car, so smooth! Awesome! so, I am glad the other people on here had a good experience at Carlife, but they tried to give me the Royal Screw job! I know I am a Princess, but I am not taking it! I went to an honest shop and now I am sharing my experience. BEWARE!!!!!!!!  If I could give NO stars I would!!!!!

I have had a couple things that weren't  perfect here, but I go often and normally  love it, so I attribute  the funky times to new employees I guess. Love the Pineapple  pancakes and omelets! Nice patio and in good weather the windows open.

I have been to many locations but this was very frustrating! The line for the drive-thru was long so I went in. I was using the new app to check in and it was acting up. I ordered from the counter- 2 meals with chocolate shakes, I waited and they gave me 1!!! GRRR! The were screwing up on exchanging, I suggested just refund and rering. Finally right- so much for faster by running inside!!!!!!! Not sure if I will go back!

Ordered eggs poachedhard, every place I go they do it,  Dennys, Cracker  Barrel, etc. They brought eggs out soft I asked if they could be cooked more because  I asked for them hard, no I could have boiled eggs. They had the Grey around the yolk and taste different, not what I wanted, didn't  eat yolk. Seriously,  every place else can handle ut!  2 stars because they were playing  Christmas  music!  The bacon, chorizo gravy and eggs  were good, spicy!  Selection  of tea when you get hot tea.  I  won't  go back, too many other choices.when I spoke to the female owner /wsitress/cashier about the eggs, how the boiled eggs were different,  not what I wanted, unappealing,  not as good, her reply was that they cook poached eggs 3 1/2 minutes  because that is the law...that is the minimum, but you can cook them more!!! I explained  that I get them that way every place I go and if places like Dennys ca get it right, there is no excuse for them or to.  It was like  talking to a brick wall. She didn't  care, so much for the customer being right!

I had dinner with The Girls Monday night, it was great! We played trivial pursuit questions- the cards are kept in old spice tins on the tables.  Our server, Kristina  was awesome!  She had a great smile and was very friendly!  Our food was hot and we didn't  have to wait for drink refills. We did not feel rushed and had plenty of time to talk, talk, talk, which was perfect!   We had chips, guac and salsa, yummy! We all indulged in burgers for Burger Monday! Yummy sweet potato fries and the dipping sauces, well they are made fresh every day and they are really delicious! We all shared one of the brownies and it was scrumptious!   Overall great experience,  the staff and ambiance  was great!  I will be going back!

I realize it was busy on Sunday of the Tempe Festival of the Arts, but there should have been enough staff to cover, the bathrooms had no towels and were filthy, just like the dining room! There was not a clean surface to be found! I have not been to a Steak and Shake in years, I remember it differently...the quality has gone down from what I remember.  The food was very mediocre. Also, when I asked about the buzzer they give you which I have been handling,  the guy takes it wirh his gloves on, messes with it, gives it back and then goes back to food preparation. .. so much for the gloves!

I went to this place because it is gluten-free because my cousin was visiting who is very seriously gluten-free because of celiac disease. Met the owner,  she told us the whole restaurant is 100% gluten-free,  so no cross contamination!  He hadn't had a donut in years and was thrilled to have one! I tried a waffle,  skeptically,  it was delicious!  It was a little bit more spongy than a regular waffle,  but no big deal, I liked it! Everything was yummy, the hot chocolate was very tasty!! She sells bags of her flour,  pancake mix, brownie mix and more to take home, very cool! It has been only open for breakfast and lunch but now expanding to Thur, Fri and Sat night for dinner.  It is small, in the end of a s hoping center. You order at the counter find a seat and they bring the food to you. They also offer cooking classes!! I will definitely go back!

Wow, this place is like the old Juttenhoops! All kinds of col and crazy stuff! Funny or naughty cards, jewelry,  character items. From the cute, nice to weird or naughty. Things you never knew existed! Things are pretty pricy bt they aren't buying in large volume to get a discount to pass on to you. But if you are looking for something unusual or unique this is the place to go. The owner is very very nice and happy to chat and tell you about the local artists that provide some of their items which is a very cool thing!

I went thru the drive-thru,  ordered a large twist cone, it was the size of a small, 1 blob instead of the normal three. The woman told me it was by weight not size and corporate was here watching! Well, I have never heard that before and after going to DQ all my life, this was a first! This is my first and last visit to this location!! I think it was more about saving money, what would a small look like, a level at the top cone? Take a clue from Mesa Main St, been there for years or others!

Fun, geeky way to get your ice cream fix. Custom make any flavor ice cream you want and watch it get hit with the liquid nitrogen in front of you, which is fun. But, I am a Gelato lover, the ice cream was somewhat soft, custard - like for me and the flavor needed a little boost, may just be what I tried. 1 scoop is $3.99 & tax, if you want nuts, add 49 cents! So $4.84..... pricey for a scoop and no cone! This and 1 in TX are the only locations. The staff was friendly  and informative.

You know that song, "I love this bar"? Well, this might be it... Great venue, huge garage doors open to Cave Creek Rd,  huge patio, really high ceiling, fans keeping it cool, vintage Harleys  suspended  from the ceilings and flanking the stage! Yummy food, great staff and entertainment!  The best Karaoke  in town on Thursday  nights, live music on Friday  and Saturday  nights. Great place, stop in and enjoy!

Huge chunk of fat in my pork, which I was told was was the Lean one between  pork and brisket. Potato  salad was cold cold but full of red onion. The beans were still hard, undercooked,  but tasted ok. The pulled chicken  was not hot!  The tops of the bottles on every table table were filty! New place, won't  go back!
