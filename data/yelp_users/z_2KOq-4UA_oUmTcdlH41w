Amazing food! The dragon eggs appetizer was great. We got the mix of steamed and crispy, but my buddy and I both agreed we preferred the crispy texture to the steamed. The sauce was tangy with some sweetness that was offset perfectly with the jalapeño slices.  As I do with a new Thai spot, I opted for the Pad Thai with chicken, my friend got the panang curry with a mix of beef and chicken. The Pad Thai was honestly one of the best I've ever had, and hands down the best in Phoenix. It was spicy, the noodles were sticky and delicious. The chicken was perfectly seasoned and cooked. The presentation was impeccable,  The panang curry was not what either of us are used to as it was red opposed to the normal green, but it was super smooth, almost smoky and crazy flavorful. It wasn't clumpy and very creamy. The only downside was the $2 charge to sub brown rice for the traditional jasmine rice.  I would highly recommend Wild Thaiger to anyone town.

Came to Sakana in Ahwatukee tonight because we were in the area and I had a great experience at the Scottsdale location. I regret that decision.  The music was very loud for dining, the galley style dining area in which we were seated was sort of cramped and was the only access to the bathroom so my shoulders were rubbed by people's behinds three times as they passed. The waitstaff started to clean the dining room and flip the chairs as we ate, although there were at least 4 other occupied tables in the restaurant and they did not close until 10:30 (we paid our bill and left at 10:40).  This brings us to the food; I was extremely disappointed in the sushi quality. We ordered whitetail and unagi to start and the unagi was unusually fishy in flavor and was over cooked. The cut of the whitetail was generous, but not the knife skill I am used to. It was not trimmed on the thin side of the filet and wasn't a consistent thickness all the way through.   About this time we were delivered a mug of hot green tea, which was odd because we didn't order any, were told they were bringing us another, then about one minute later a server came by and said sorry and took it from our table. This only seemed odd because when I waited tables I would never think of taking something from a table, even after serving it to the incorrect one. We then had the Roller Coaster roll and found the spicy tuna on top to be mushy and flavorless.   The best thing about the meal was the tempura calamari. It was crispy and flavorful and not greasy. I expected more based my previous experience, not sure if it was just an off night but the number of issues were off putting.

The crew at Renew are amazing! I've taken a few of my vehicles to them over the years and the quality and timeliness have always been perfect. They do all the work with the insurance company and even arrange rental car pickup at their shop. It's always been a pleasant experience and I've even taken my cars there before I sell them for a "refresh" which has always been a very fair price and allowed me to sell my vehicles like showroom quality.

This place is awesome. Tasty burgers and fresh cut steak fries. Tons of options from the classic burger toppings, to sautéed garlic and pesto! You can also get fried eggs or even pastrami!  The feel is super chill and great music. Sherl, the owner is super cool, and always helpful for first-timers.  Thirsty? How about one of the 16 flavors of lemonade?! I've been searching for the best burger in Phoenix, and this is up there with the chuckbox near ASU, Ted's in Cave Creek and Lucky Boy as far as a "great burger" goes!
