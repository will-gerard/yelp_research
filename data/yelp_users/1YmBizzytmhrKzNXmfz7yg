Love Babbo. They presented catering options at work and that was my first impression Becky is awesome. I've got food to go and also ordered in at work. Awesome food and Monday and Tuesday spaghetti and meatball special cannot be beat.

The place is very nice and swanky. We had brunch there for Mother's Day today and it was very nice. The main dining room was warm but after they turned down the lights it cooled off. The food was delicious... Eggs Benedict, meatball sandwich, omelets and salads. Every dish ordered was delicious. I got a cinnamon roll to go so will dig into that tonight. Mango mimosas were delicious too. Overall, we will be back. Mancuso never fails to satisfy.

I have been twice now within a week and the guys here are great. They listen and serve up some excellent food. The Saturday 5.00 specials are delicious and prepared fresh to order. I will be going down there to get my meat from now on....way to go Hobe Meat Guys

This place is a hidden gem. We were there for restaurant week. The food was outstanding as was the service. The staff were very nice and pleasant as well as attentive. I cannot recall the names of the food we ordered but it was the best Indian food I have ever tasted. I highly recommend this place. We will be back.  Don't forget to check out the market that is located to the eastern part of the dining room.    The chai was also very tasty and delicious.

Very clean and professional. Plus for me was the fact that they are an American Express merchant. Was able to get in the same day too. I will definitely be back and refer my friends   Great location as well

I've been a patient of Dr. Nelson's since they opened many years ago. The team is awesome as are all of the physicians. I love the philosophy as well as them being up to date and modern in their care and technology. I'd recommend them hands down.

Buyer Beware If I could give negative stars I would...where do I begin... My first atttempt to make contact with this salon to schedule an appointment should have been my first clue as to what I could expect. There was no answer during the posted business hours. I then drove to the salon where I encountered unlocked doors but no one inside. I then went next door to the massage place and asked about getting an appointment. The receptionist took my name and phone number and assured me that someone would call me.  No one called me. I then called and scheduled an appointment. I specifically stated that I wanted a full set of nails and a pedicure and asked how long of an appointment was needed and assured before I hung up that these services would be performed. I showed up on time for my appointment.  I mentioned that I had an engagement that evening and what time I needed to be finisheed in order to go home, change and arrive at my destination for the evening.  It took 2 hours to get my nails done...this was a back fill as I had nails on at the time. Upon finishing my nails I was asked to choose a color for my pedicure. I had to again state that I had to leave as I had an engagement that I needed to be at so left after having just one of two services performed.  Approx 6 days later, Lana the owner (who did my naild) returned my original phone call asking me what type of appointment I was interested in scheduling. I had to advise her that I was just there and that she did my nails for me. Talk about awkward.  I returned 4 weeks later for a fill and was scheduled with a new employee as Lana was not available. I agreed and was seen by V or Voe... I was pleased with the fill in service he provided. He made a point of asking what I preferred and if I was comfortable during my appointment.   I returned 4 weeks later, having made an appointment for a back fill along with a pedicure. I asked about the length of the appointment needed in order to get a back fill and a pedi as I was leaving for vacation. I was assured that 3 hrs was plenty of time.  I advised V of what I wanted and he proceeded to begin. He was not familiar with the product I chose, seashell and colored gel. He mentioned multiple times that at is other places of employment he performed this procedure using different techniques but since he was here he had to go by the way Lana wanted. It took 3 hours just to complete my backfill. I also wanted a thin line of glitter placed between the seashell product and the pink acrylic used on my nail bed. He applied silver paint. By this time I was late and needed to leave as I had dinner plans. My nails were very very thin and looked horrible but I was leaving the following day for vacation and did not have time to go back in. I then called the salon and left a message for Lana to call me so I could talke to her. She never called me back so I called again the following week. I gave specific details to the lady who answered the phone including my name, number and the tech who performed my services. Again, no call back from Lana.  My nails were very very thin and after 3 weeks, I had a total of 4 broken nails. I had never had this issue before.   I do not advise anyone to have services performed here at this salon. The salon looks nice but the services offered and provided are greatly lacking than those offered by nearby salons.  Customer service and satisfaction are non existant and one would be wasting their time and money by soliciting services by anyone hete at this salon.

This salon is top notch! It's clean and modern. Upon arrival, you will be offered a beverage which range from water, cola, beer and wine. The team is current on the latest vids, styles and trends not to mention the products offered for use at home.  They offer online scheduling that cover just about 7 days a week. I have followed Stevie from her other salons. She knows her stuff when it comes to color, hi lights, low lights and vibrant colors. I always get compliments on my hair and am continually asked who does my hair. Schedule with Stevie...you will not be disappointed.  The salon is easy to get to from any area of the valley too.

This salon takes appointments as well as walk ins. They have always been very nice and friendly. Tanya is my favorite for pedicures.

Only one star due to the extreme loudness of the music. Can't carry on a conversation or hear when your order is up. Turn it down a bit.  Love the food ur won't eat inside due to loud music
