All this hype for nothing.    1.  This place has no natural foods.  I wasnt expecting whole foods, but really, whats the point?   2.  They have very little gourmet food.   3.  Why not just go to Fry's or Safeway?  I mean seriously... "fine foods"?? You sell friggin cherios. Whats fine about that?    The same exact stuff you get at safeway for more $.  I will shop at Sprouts.  Hey AJ... GFYS.

Generally my mornings consist of hitting the snooze button at least 5 times.  Getting out of bed is a difficult thing for me to do.  But remember being a kid? When there were those select days that getting out of bed wasnt hard?  First day of school, Christmas morning, Tuesdays and Thursdays during the summer when the hot neighbor would do her swimming and sunbathing before work... ahh, those were the days.    Tomorrow will be one of those days when i dash out of bed... why? Because by noon, i will be at Oreganos stuffing my face with a Veggie Wedgie & Sweet Potato fries.  As a grown up, It's the little things in life that get me out of bed.  (Though, that swimming & sunbathing MILF might also still do it too.)  I've never had the pizza at Oregano's... in fact, since i have had the Veggie Wedgie, I may never have anything else at Oregano's.  Thanks to you, sweet Wedgie of the Veg... i will sleep with visions of sugarplums... no wait... eggplant, goat cheese, roma tomatoes, spinach, portobellos and feta.  Ahhh... i'm looking forward to you already.   Zzzzzzz.

Dear reader.... Before you decide if this place is great... think about what else you consider great.  When you were 17 and you took a date to Olive Garden, okay, you get a pass.  BUT, if you ever ever ever went on a date to Outback, or Red Lobster... just stop right now.  You will think this place is just amaaaaazing.  So come out, enjoy their food and on the way home jump out into traffic. (Please do that behind me, so as not to make me late to work.)  Okay, that said... This place struggles from an identity crisis.  Rokerij, who are you appealing to?  The fools that think that this is a classy joint because their previous best date was to Applebees?  OR are you a really good place?  This place should not have a $12 chicken sandwich with fries on the same menu as a $43 steak.  Choose one direction and stick with it.    I called up at 6pm on a Saturday, first available reservation was for 9pm.  This is a good sign.  I take the reservation and then went for a hair cut at Urban Hair... see my other review, they rule.  We get to Rokerij at 830ish.  I walk in the door, and apologize to the staff who are clearly at a waiter station.  We must have walked in the side door.  Whoops!   No, thats the front.  Wait, what?  A friggin computer screen and some silverware, thats the front?  No no, it cant be... oh yes.  Yes, this is phoenix.  Yes, this is the front.  Okay, okay... im cool... whatever.  We will be downtstairs having a drink.  The bar downstairs is okay.  Some 50 yr old dude trying to flirt with a 20something girl.   Standard.   We have martinis.  Not bad, the bartender made it okay.  Chopin vodka.  He didnt really know what to do with the vermouth, but it was okay.    I chat with my friend, we are sitting on a couch, its pretty fun so far.  A server comes down and says, "your table is ready"  Cool.  We stand up.  She goes over and starts talking to the 50yr old male cougar and his little cub.  We wait.... finally i walk over to her.  AH HEM... should we just go upstairs?  She turns  "yep, i said it was ready."  Oooooh no.  You had better walk my ass right up to my table.  Nope, i can already tell the service is going to be abysmal.    We walk upstairs.  We wait there for almost 5 min.  Then i grab a bus boy and in broken espanol, i ask him... neccecitamos una mesa... ya dig?  He starts wiping down a table.  I ask my date... why the hell do we have reservations again?  Then as we are being seated, a hostess girl says, "oh your table is over here"  WELLL princess, thanks so much for telling me that 10 min ago....  and we sit.   The waitress comes over and says "what can i get ya?"  Excuse me Maude... what is this a diner?  Can i get a slice a pie and a glass of manners?  I ask her what her name is... i then introduce myself and start to read some of the specials off of the wall.  She gets the hint.  I hate my decision to come here.  We order more martinis... Vodka might make this better.   We order some specials... i get meat, lots of it.  The food is very good, though pricey.  Im still annoyed that there is a $10 cheeseburger on the menu.  Dont get me wrong, i love a PBR and a Burger... just not what i was expecting after all of the reviews i read.    When the time comes to order dessert, i think to myself... seriously, lets just stop at starbucks.  We get our check.    The bottom line.  This place has good food, but is not a fancy joint.  If people said, its a decent bar with good food, i would say: "heck yes, 4 stars, just needs some better service."  But they think they are classy, and so does yelp... its not.  Frankly, It shouldnt have anything on the menu over $27.  The service is friggin dreadful.  A half drunk toddler could manage this place better.     That is all...

Awesome salon, great service, totally great place.  Being new to town, i was looking to get a hair cut at a place that wasnt a chain.  I called in at about 6pm on a Saturday night and i was told that they would be around for another hour or so, i went right up.  The location is kind of hard to find at first, and looks tiny from the door... but its huge inside!  Each room has its own theme and vibe.  Very cool space!  I was greeted by a few cool people working there and then i was walked into the back to a chair.  We talked about what i wanted and i was offered a beer or a glass of wine.    Rian was my stylist, she was awesome.  The cut took quite a long time, but thats because she was really trying to figure out how to best fix a few problem spots and give me a great cut.  Honestly, the best hair cut i have ever had.  I fully expected to pay like $30+ for the cut, but it was only $20 and they gave me 20% off, making it just $16!?  Crazy.    For the ladies, they do a full manicure, pedicure, and full waxing too. Several private rooms for all of these things.    Best cut ever... great people who really care about their craft.  They are true artists.  This isnt a cheapo chain, its a quality place... but its really affordable too.  5 stars, for sure...  EDIT - Rian was only my stylist once, she no longer works there.  I've been seeing Matty for 7 months now, he is fan-friggin-tastic.  All the people there are great... i love this salon.

Situated about 2 blocks from my office and directly next to a Starbucks means I'm here for lunch or a bite after work several times a month.  Bistro 24 is yet to disappoint.   The service is always stellar, but it's the Ritz, so it ought to be.  The food is all quite good.  It's not the most romantic or fanciest dining room... There are more fun & eclectic places to take a date but is a great place to take a client or colleague for a bite.  i think of the Bistro as more of a lunch place than a dinner spot, but it certainly goes either way.   If you are looking to try the Bistro but are on a bit of a budget, i would try one of these two little tips: 1.  Check out Friday Night Grill... its about 35 per person and all you can eat.  They have steak freshly cooked on the grill outside and a variety of sushi and salads inside.  The desert table is decadent.  For less than you'd spend on a steak next door at Morton's, you'll get a ton of high quality delicious food. 2.  Happy Hour is at 5pm.  Their appetizers and many drinks (including draft beer) are half off.  Get a Firestone Pale Ale or Double Brown Ale for just $3.  One of my favorite appetizers is the Ratatouille Pizza. (Only $7 during happy hour!). It's delicious and eats like a meal.    Bon appetit

I'm still looking for a GREAT burger.  I cant find one.  Ill review ZinBurger next.    This place is okay.  The fries are good, burger is good...  I'm just looking to be WOWed.  Also... The burgers didnt have many options.   No list of anything fancy or unexpected.  Just a pretty standard burger.   Oh but the fries are served in a mini shopping cart, so thats just sooooo cool, that it makes up for everything else being just so-so...    Wait, no... my mistake... the fries delivery system doth not make up for an otherwise Meh experience.   NEEEEEEXT!

Another LGO restaurant... and a pretty cool one.   Great ambiance. Excellent patio out back.  Super cool giant lamps inside.  I like the design quite a bit.   The comfort food is nice, though may be a bit overpriced.  A few of the menu items are exactly the same as you'd get at LGO for quite a bit more.  For that reason, If you are heading to Chelsea's... go with the "Very Special" section of the menu... no need to have the burgers here.    The short ribs were phenomenal... the mashed potatoes were stellar.  Also tried the Wood Fired Rotisserie Chicken.    Though i went with a friend, i think this would be a pretty good date spot.  If that's whatcher into.  ;)

What kind of self respecting restaurant and bar closes at 11pm on a Saturday??  St. Francis does!  Ridiculous.  Now, you may ask: "What does this have to do with Ticoz??"  Good question...  I went to St. Francis at 11:15 on Saturday to grab a cocktail and a bite to eat, but they were closed?!     ::::Looking Around Confused:::  Is this Omaha?  Or is this Phx, the 5th largest city in the US?  You close a restaurant at 11?  This place should just start getting crowded at 9:30!  Ludicrous   I decided to cruise over to Ticoz and sit at the bar.  We asked what the specialty was... the staff told us to try the Enchiladas and the Sangria.  And so we did!  Blue Corn Chicken Enchiladas with a Fried Egg on top!   Si Senor!    om nom nom!  (or En Espanol:  ohm gnome gnome)  Nice Sangria selection & I hear the Mojito's are great here.  Try the standard house red sangria with an added shot of Pomegranate Vodka... Es Delicioso!    Great outdoor patio and nice indoor dining area.   I'll be back... after 11pm.  Gracias.  Edit:  Ok, so i went back again the next day.  Not because it was that good, but just cuz i was in the area... ummm... yeah, thats it.    Had the crazy fancy mac n cheese with pork... Daaaaamn smokey!   It was veeeeerry good.  Try it.

Seeing as how i work about 14 seconds away from this place, I'm here a few times per week.  The menu is pretty good.  Lots of TVs.  It was awesome for World Cup Soccer this summer, great for Baseball all season and packed for Football in the fall.  Great patio... nice fire pit in the fall.    The best part about the half moon is the staff...  Chelsea, Liz, Candy & Courtney behind the bar are absolutely fantastic.  The servers are all also excellent.    Thanks to the ladies at Half Moon for making this bar better than average.

This weekend I took my first trip to Wag N' Wash.... part accessory boutique, part delicious grocery store, part torture chamber.  My roommate took me here on saturday and i was pretty excited when I arrived.  They had his and hers fire hydrants out front, which is pretty cool.  I peed on one and we made our way inside.  First we checked out the food section. They carry my favorite brand, Taste of the Wild.  (Previously I had only found this at Kodi's on 16th St. and Bethany.)   Then I perused the accessories.  Nice necklaces and pretty awesome toys.  I found a super cool Stegasauraus and carried it around for a while.   Then my rooomate says, "hey, let's go check out the back."  The back?  There's more to this awesome place?  Heck yes, let's go!   And then everything changed....  The door swung open to the back of the store.  I heard other guys in there crying.  What the hell was going on?    My roommate picked me up and put me into this steel box.  Some sort of medieval torture device.  (Dude, i thought we were cool, wtf?!)   Then he puts on an apron and gets to work.  Splash, bam, boom.... water torture!  Its a nightmare. Soap everywhere, i tried to escape but i was tied down.  After what felt like 14 years he turned off the water started to towel dry me off.  Then he gave me some cologne.  (That doesnt make this okay bro.)  Finally i made my exit and back to the "front" of the store.  I rushed around and tried to warn all the other dudes and bitches in there, but none of them listened.  I think a few actually enjoyed that room.  Masochists.    So I made my roommate buy me some gourmet snacks.  Peanut Butter stars were good, but the little Cinnamon Rolls were my favorite.  I also got 2 frozen bison bones with marrow... which i intend on eating on my roommates bed and pillow as revenge.  Oh, and i got my Stegasaurus.    So go to Wag N Wash if you want some toys or food, it rocks... but whatever you do.  Stay. Out. Of. The. Back. Room.

Jesus... what a dive.  Not necessarily a bad thing, but just dont expect anything more. Greg Louganis stylee.   Cheap drinks... always welcome. Everything on the menu is fried bar food... to be expected. Walking through the smoking section just to get in... trashy. Trivia on Friday while the playoffs were on... wtf?    I thought this was a sports bar!  They mute a playoff game to do trivia??   Why the hell would anyone go here if Half Moon and Teakwoods are nearby?  Screw this joint.  I'll gladly pay a few bucks more for a better bar with better TVs.  Weak Sauce.

ummm yes.  They had Dogfish Head's Midas Touch in stock.  are you kiddin.  No sir, im not.    This may be called "another house-turned-pub" in downtown, but its those houses that MAKE downtown phx a decent place.  Walking up to this place, it feels like you are walking into a house party in the hood.  But it had a great local funk & jazz band playing with top notch craft brews available.  Its cozy yet loud, its quaint yet urban, its house jug wine, yet top shelf.... this is the best of the house-bars that i have visited in phx.  better than Rose & Crown... better than Roosevelt's.... it rocks... 5 stars...

Alrighty... here we go. This place has pretty decent food.  Its not terrible at all.  However, the place claims to be healthy and fresh... I have a fundamental problem with a place that uses styrofoam plates, styrofoam cups, styrofoam to-go containers and individually plastic wrapped forks and knives.  Do you know how much landfill that is per person?    The food is okay, but there is nothing healthy or fresh about styrofoam.    F-    i wont be returning.

St. Francis is the patron saint of Animals and the Environment... Confession Wednesday: i googled that, i have no recollection of anything from CCD.  Anywho... St. Francis, Central Phx thanks you.  Came by for a cocktail and an appetizer. Sat at the outside bar and got great service!   The baked goat cheese appetizer was warm & delicious.  Had a well made martini and the lady had a tasty Almond Margarita.  Cool decor, i love the glass cube window booth in the front, very mod.  The crowd was great.  Full house and a good mixed crowd of all ages & types... everyone was really friendly & having a good time.    The only complaint we had was that the dinner menu wasnt too extensive.  Only about 6 options and nothing really caught our eye.  We ended up just having cocktails for a bit and then took off for somewhere else.  Overall... another cool spot in CenPho.  I'll definitely be back for drinks afterwork sometime soon.  Update: Came back and had the Salmon over red quinoa.  It was excellent.  Also put back a few good brews. Dogfish Head 90 min IPA is always a favorite. The bar manager knows quite a bit about the wine and beer that he carries. Nice Job St. Fran.

I wanted to love this place.  I love many South American wines and was pretty excited to see that they serve Quilmes... but really, this place is just Meh.    Small building, the bar has only 4 seats.  The patio is the main draw.   How do they get away with opening this place 6 years after Postino's and still try to rip it off?  The bruschetta is way better at postino, and you get more.  The wine and beer list is also better at postinos, and is waaaaay better priced.   Not really worth checking out...  there are many other wine bars that are better.

Coming from Downtown Denver, i expect a hopping downtown scene and Phx has a lot to be desired.  (Its just far too segregated of a city and there are pockets of greatness, but vast expanses of useless nothing in between them which seems to make this a "must get in your car and drive" city.) That said, this was the first pub i visited when i moved into Downtown Phx, and i really loved it.  Great vibe... very cool space.  I love that the conversion of this old home into a pub makes the old rooms separate and gives each room its own identity.  Also, and quite importantly, they have a great beer selection.  It could be better, and in NY or Colorado i would probably bitch about this beer selection.  But given that AZ is pretty weak when it comes to craft brews, i was impressed with R&C.  I loved that they had Dogfish Head Punkin Ale in a bottle... i wish they had a bit more on tap, but i love that they at least knew what it was.  Also they had a 60 min IPA in a bottle... i hoped for a 90 min (knowing full well that a 120 min was totally out of the question.)  But again... 60 min Dogfish IPA in a bottle is awesome to find in a pub thats 3 blocks from my house.    I didnt eat the food, but anyone that is giving R&C a low rating because of the food is simply eating in the wrong place.  This isnt fine dining people... its bar food.  It looked as it should.  Jeezz..  I will certainly be back.  A personal thanks to the owners for creating a great space with good beer, a good vibe and no "No Firearms" signs at the door.

I heard that there are only two good Breakfast places in phoenix: Over Easy and Matts Big Breakfast.  I am a big fan of quality breakfast and am pretty picky about them.  This Over Easy location stops seating at about 11:30am.  Frankly, I think thats ridiculously early so i Inquired as to why.  I was told that they would stay open later, but as a part of their lease they have to close early because they share a parking lot with the neighbors.  Their Scottsdale location stays open later and the menu is exactly the same.    We got there around 10:45 on Saturday.  The wait for a table for 2 was about 30 min. They have a pot of coffee out, with a sign that says "help yourself to coffee while you wait, we will be happy to add it to your check."  Listen up.  If i am waiting to eat at your place, you can at least give me the coffee for free while i wait.  If im drinking coffee BEFORE i sit down.  There is a damn good chance that i will order a cup when i get to the table, just charge me for it then.  I was peeved by this.  Its coffee for gods sake.    Once we got our table, one of us ordered the Pecan Banana French Toast, the other got an Omelet.  The food was good, arrived quickly and the chef came around to several tables to see how everything was.    Contrary to what others said, the portions were average and were what we expected.  The service wasnt bad either.  The place was pretty crowded and they still managed to keep my coffee cup full and the food came out quickly.    I dont think there is really anything spectacular about this joint, the food was good, the menu was standard.  But its pretty good and we'll probably come back.

Again, this is part of my comittment to try a restaurant 3 times before reviewing.  My 3rd visit was this weekend and the feeling is still the same.... Bocca is just another Postino rip off, only with average pizza added to the menu.    The pizza is nothing special.  The sandwiches are okay, but you can find better at a deli.  Beer list is decent.  (Tripel Karmaliete, yes!)   Bruschetta Planks are just like the boards at Postino.  Literally, only one was different (pulled pork and pesto).  You get more at postino and they cut them into halves at Bocca while they are sliced into 4 pieced at postino so more people can try them.   Simply put... it's decent for a spot on Mill Ave, but there is absolutely nothing special about this place.  Blaaaaah.

Petsmart is like shopping at WalMart... Do you grocery shop at WalMart?  If you do, then you probably feed your dog Gravy Train... im sure you and your family are healthy, fit and well adjusted.  Chances are you dont Yelp, so this isnt for you.     If you care about feeding your best friend a better meal, then check out Noble Beast.  This place has a great selection of awesome natural food and treats.  Unfortunately they dont carry the Organic Grain Free brand that i buy for my boy... Taste of the Wild.  They do have a bunch of other great brands though... i would recommend this joint, even though i cannot shop there.   Word up...

Everything on the menu is worth trying!   Not everything is organic or natural, but they have a decent selection and use pretty good ingredients.  I really seek out good organic spots, hard to find, True Food is pretty good.  My Top Picks: Beverage: Medicine Man Elixir Salad: Greek Chopped w/ Chicken Sandwich: Columbia River Salmon w/ lime & avocado Entree:  Spaghetti Squash Casserole Sides:  Farro!!  (It's awesome, sweet with dates.)   Usually busy around lunch, call ahead and put your name on the list!  But even if you don't, there's plenty of room, and they turn tables quick, so you can get in and out in under an hour if you need to.    They are the official catering restaurant of the Phx Suns.  They must like it, because i was there for lunch this Friday and Grant Hill walked in.    Good spot for lunch in the Biltmore!

Stopped into Tuck Shop after work for a happy hour cocktail and a bite to eat on a recommendation from a friend.    Tuck Shop is off the beaten path and well worth popping in.  Half Price glasses of wine were an unexpected treat before 6pm.  Had the Dates stuffed with Chorizo and Gruyere... Excellent.    I'd also recommend the Shrimp, Asparagus & Cauliflower with the dipping sauces.  The sweet one has a pretty interesting base ingredient.  See if you can guess what it is!  Once you recognize it, the flavor overwhelms the sauce, so you may just be better off enjoying the mystery.    The ambiance is pretty cool.  Rather than getting a table or sitting at the bar, We sat on the couch in the reading room.  Excellent mid-century mod chairs, tables and sofa.     Visit Tuck Shop for sure... one of central Phx's gems!  In a sea of strip malls and chain restaurant trash... Tuck Shop is more proof that this city has heart, just gotta poke around.

I have totally fallen in love at Tuck Shop.  Everything here is fantastic.  My friend and I come here about twice a month and enjoy some snacks and wine.  The beer battered Cheese Curds may just change your life for the better... we are seriously tempted to each get our own order.   (I am not very good at sharing and i always get what I want!   ...No i'm not an only child... well, maybe I was until i was 11, how did you know.  WAH!)     Oh, and Laura is fantastic.  She always takes great care of us as we enjoy a glass of wine on the couch in the reading room.    Thursday's special is meat loaf... don't deny yourself, just indulge.  :)

After a long night of drinking, ScrAMble is a great little b'fast spot!  I like the style where you order on the way in and they bring it to you.  This is a MUST when i am very hung over.  I just cannot handle waiting 30 min for a table and then another 40 min for food with the sounds of silverware slamming against ceramic plates.... not when im this hungover.  :-/  The only drawback is that they dont have cocktails, and sometimes i really need a bloody mary.  Scramble's food is great and affordable.  Dog friendly patio and good coffee.    Do it up sunnyslope.

I never reviewed Postinos??  Well.. this place was a regular stop for me in the phx.  All the boards of bruschetta are great.  Monday and Tuesday after 8 is the best... $20 for a board and a bottle??  Yes please.   Super dog friendly on the patio, great wait staff.  $5 glasses of wine and mini pitchers of beer before 5pm.  I wish i was there right now.

Pronounced with your best NY accent... "Tha Pah-lah"   I'm a sucker for most things Mid-Century modern... and the Parlor is a damn cool building with great decor.  The beer selection is decent.  Nothing crazy, but some good rotating taps.  Always a good Sierra.  And, i love Red Nectar on tap.  Just a good smooth ale for the summer.  Also a nice rotating wine list, pretty good for a pizza place.   Check the chalk board by the bar... whatever is on special is worth trying.  usually something locally grown and seasonal.  Always a good choice!  My Top Picks here: Best Pizza: Smokey.  Best Salad:  Heirloom Tomato Best Sandwich i've ever had in my life: Duck Club  Thats right... i've even been here on several occasions, all by myself, just to pop in after work, sit at the bar and indulge in the Duck Club and a pint after a long day at work.    The duck isnt gamey.  The tomato jam isnt as sweet as i expected.  (Certainly way more savory than the tomato jam that Postino's makes and uses on their bruschetta) the Bacon is thick cut and fantastic.   This is, hands down, my favorite sandwich in Phoenix.  Give it a shot!  Enjoy!

First thing's first... steak isn't modern, it was like the caveman's first meal.  So, if you aren't cooking it on a spaceship... lay off the trickery!  :)  Fox Rest's are pretty much Hit or Miss, and people either love or hate the decor.  Personally, I don't mind the decor.  It's different, and pretty fun.  The uniforms are fun, dudes in lavender with chuck taylor's.  The girls in short and tight denim colored rompers.  This just isnt as good as Morton's... but it ranks up there with some pretty good steakhouses.  Most of the steak is grain fed, which generally makes for a much fattier, juicier steak.  You don't order a steak for health, so get over it.  I did, however, go with the natural grass fed organic Meyer Natural Angus 12oz NY Strip.  It's grass fed for the first few months, then organic grain fed for the last few weeks to fatten it up before the slaughter.  It was very very good, especially for a NY Strip.   The sides serve 2, we ordered 3 for 4 people and it was more than enough.  Asparagus was pretty thick but not too tart.  The brussles sprouts were seasoned well and very good.  Sweet potato puree with burnt marshmallow is incredible.  (It could totally be a dessert!)    The servers are knowledgeable, the food is good and the drinks are very well poured.  The wine list is fairly extensive but not crazy.    Only complaint I have is that the Valet service isnt dedicated to this restaurant (nor any), it costs $7, not a huge deal if they are there all night.  But they leave at 10:30pm.  Seems to be early on a Saturday night.  For $7, i should be able to enjoy my dinner without looking at my watch to make sure the valet wont lock up my keys.  Pretty friggin lame.    All in all... I dig this place and will certainly come back.

The Meh Ingredient...  TMI caught my eye a few times as i drove down 7th st, so i made it a point to stop in and check out the joint.    A friend and I arrived after work.  It was about 6pm on a Thursday, so the happy hour crowd should be there.  Surprisingly enough, there were only 2 other tables of people there... This, my friends, is a bad sign.    But hey, i'm a craft beer fan, I love me some ALE... and this is an Ale House, so i'm about to be in heaven, right.... ahem... right??    Well, for an Ale House, the beer selection leaves a LOT to be desired.  First of all, if it's an Ale House, the staff should know a thing or two about beer, which they don't.  Don't go there and count on a good suggestion or description of the brews.  If you want a good beer selection, go to Roosevelt's or Lost Leaf.  TMI pales in comparison.    As for the food... we sampled the Olives, which are... well, olives.  But the olive selection at Postino's is far better.  Something about citrus zest in the olives just doesnt work for me.    Then we had the Pro-Pasto board. The menu advertises "a sampler of meats, cheeses and veggies."  Well, I love a mystery, so we take the chance.  As we sipped our beers, the waitress arrived with the board of pro-pasto... she sets it down and walks away.  Wooooah, hold up sister!  What the hellzobah is even on this board?  How about a little rundown?  Oh, I see, this is a little quiz for me?  Cute!  Actually, this server has no idea what's on the board either.  Fortunately it was so unimpressive, that we could clearly make out the provolone & salami... glorious.  They don't know much about the beer, nor the food.   Off to a great start here.   It's advertised as a "cafe" and not a "restaurant", so i cant complain much about the weak menu (only offering sandwiches).  But if your staple is going to be the beer... then for heavens sake, have a better selection.  Not that the beers were bad, but they are available just about anywhere.  EVERYONE carries Four Peaks, and its not even a great brewery.  They did have an Oskar Blues brew from Lyons CO, but only the Gordon, no DPA.  Not even one Dogfish Head in a bottle.    If your taps are going to be lackluster... Id recommend these TMI people take a little class trip up to Total Wine on camelback and stock the fridge with some bottles of good stuff.  While yer up there, how about reading some lables and taking a class.  Learn a thing or two about beer... or at least about Ale's.    That's my $0.02. Not sorry aBOUT it.  Yer lucky my tip was more than that.

La Condesa is amazing.  I'll keep this review short and sweet...  Short wait is well worth it.  Horchata is amazing The Mahi Mahi Burro might change your life... if i wasnt already in a relationship with the Jalapeno Cilantro Hummus from Pita Jungle, i might actually try to make love with this burrito.    Everything about this place is great.  Eat here... if you don't, you are probably crazy... maybe you are the dude at Circle K that is always talking to himself by the dumpster...  That dude creeps me out a little bit.    So, i guess the moral here is:  Eat at La Condessa, so you don't end up talking to a dumpster.  That is all.

Sweet joint... not a lot of clothes but a ton of cool old stuff.  Prices are pleasant.  I love how this shop is situated in an old house and the goods are located where you'd find them in a home.  Kitchen stuff in the kitchen, bathroom stuff in the bathroom, everything else in the living room and bedrooms.  Much more stuff for ladies than gents, but certainly worth checking out.  ...if yer into that sort of thing.  (By "that sort of thing" i mean, anything pre ipod.)

Aaaallllll right.... I will come to the defense of Stingray.  It's not the best sushi i've ever had.  But it's certainly pretty good, especially for Phoenix.    The Cabo Blanco roll is very good for a fusion type roll.  Mexican flair on your sushi roll?!  Ole!    It's not the cheapest, but who the hell is looking for cheap sushi?  Honestly people... Do you really want the cheapest possible RAW fish? Think that through for a second...  Right, i thought not.   The Biltmore location is convenient.  The decor is pretty cool.  The crowd is far better than the Scottsdale location.  I've never had a problem with the service and i've been there at least a half dozen times & i'm sure i'll end up there again for lunch sometime soon.   Give it a shot!

FailBurger  As i said in my review of Delux... I'm still looking for a great burger place in central phx.  This place let me down.    Not that the food was terrible, but it was just mediocre.  First of all, I had to wait for a table... Usually a good sign!    The waitress was about 16, she knew nothing about wine and was totally incabable of answering questions.  The waitstaff bus their own tables, so it takes longer to turn them.  Then a 17 year old server was arguing with the 16 year old hostess about seating his section.  Terrible.  People... sweet potato fries taste pretty much the same everywhere, lets calm down... mmmkay?  Thanks.  This place blows a hole.  Fox Restaurant Concepts is hit or miss.  Bloom is a miss, True Food is a Hit, ZinBurger is a miss, Sauce is a hit.  etc etc etc.    If you want a good burger and an overpriced bottle of wine that the server knows nothing about... i suggest going to 5Guys Burgers, grab one to go... and get a bottle of wine from the grocery store... just pick one with the coolest label.  Same result.

Once upon a time there was a restaurant named Vig. It lived in Arcadia.  It wanted to be cool, but was only half cool because it was constantly infiltrated by the evil clan of douche bags named Scottsdalians.  Then one day Vig met a better neighborhood called Cenpho/Uptown.  They fell in love and made a new Vig in a beautiful mid-century mod Bank in Uptown.  This new Vig was about a zillion times cooler.  Proof that sequels can be better than the original.  (Please see Back to the Future 2, Empire Strikes Back, or Evil Dead 2 for more confirmation of this.)   Vig Uptown has an awesome Bocce Ball court in the restaurant.  The food is all good... Ask Juan Schwartz.   The drinks are all well poured.  The bar staff is excellent... They have Tito's handmade vodka in stock and its very well priced.  The crowd is way cooler and the valet's are always on point.  I am a regular at the Vig Uptown, you probably should be too.   Oh, and if you live in the neighborhood, the Vig Rig will pick you up and take you home.  He works on tips only, so leave the ride at home and tip the Vig Rig instead of the valet... SO worth it.    ...And i lived happily ever after.

Blows/reBlows  Just like Nine05 and Fate, this place will be closed down soon.  The only difference is that this place will close even faster.  Surprising really, because Fez and Switch are pretty good.  The food and service at Bliss was absolutely dreadful.    I sat down and asked the server what the Rotating tap of Sierra Nevada was.  He said "what's Sierra Nevada?, is that a beer?"    Where the hell did they find this server?  Are you serious?  How do you not know what Sierra Nevada is??    He goes to the bar to ask what it is, he comes back and says "its a brown ale, like octoberfest"  I ask: "Is it Tumble?"  He says, "oh yeah, thats what they called it."  Ok, how the hell do you forget the name of the beer from the bar to my table, its like 20 feet!  This server is the dumbest thing ever...  I hope this kid falls face first into the fryer.     Then we ask him how a few things are:  He says, "the burger is ok, thats my style."  Then he proceeds to tell me "Well, i sold a lot of this, and a lot of that."  Look sparky, i didnt ask how sales were, i want to know whats good.  If a parade of fools came in and ordered 200 poopwiches, that makes them a good seller, still doesnt make them good!  CaPish?   I ordered the Veggie Sandwich... The eggplant was soggy, the bread was burnt (see my pic)...  the carrot slaw was SO covered in garlic crap, that it was not edible.  I didnt even eat a quarter of the food.  They cleared the plate without even asking how it was.    Seriously... i cannot fathom ever going back to this place.  I wish i could give this less than 1 star.... it deserves  a -5.  Epic Fail.

Sometimes you have to listen to an album 3 times before you decide if you like it, love it or loathe it.... For this reason, i'm really trying to resist the temptation to review a spot after just one visit.  This weekend i hit Beckett's for the third time.  Everyone is raving about Beckett's and with fair reason, it's pretty good.  But let's drill down a bit further and see if it's really all it's cracked up to be.    Apps:  * Brussels Sprouts are good, but i think it's just a trendy item to toss onto your menu these days.   * The enchiladas are alright, but they don't "wow" anyone.  let's face it... this just isn't the place for enchiladas in the PHX.   * What is wrong with this: "beckett's original grilled cheese with pancetta (aka bacon)"  [Hint: "aka"] Pancetta is not Bacon.  Pancetta, like bacon, is also made from pork belly,  But pancetta is rolled and cured, bacon is smoked. The flavor is decidedly different.    Mains: * The short ribs are great... but then again, i never met a short rib that i didnt like.  I'm a sucker for short ribs on a menu.   * Chicken & Dumplings... major let down.  (They were out of short ribs, so i asked the server for a reco.)  Dumplings were pretty uneventful.  Chicken was tender, but dude... its chicken.   *  Tasted the Osso Buco and it was pretty tasty.    Cocktails and Beer: Drinks are well poured and fairly inventive.  Not too shabby. Beer list is so so... some 4peaks and a Stella.  nothing really exciting.    Dessert: i *love* the hot/cold combo, so i'll practically make love to anything "a la mode"   ....naturally the poached pear & blueberry cobbler with ice cream was on my list.   It was about 6000 degrees and you couldnt really taste it.  Also, the icecream was tiny and you need more for the cobbler.  However, the chocolate covered bacon (note: not pancetta, so they clearly know the difference, they just think you are dumb when you read the apps menu.) and PB s'mores were to die for!    Seriously... this desert is creative, delicious and hands down the best $5 you'll spend all night.    Bottom line is... Beckett's is pretty good grub, nice ambiance (for a strip mall) and a pretty good menu.  The food isnt amaaaaaaaazing, but it's worth checking out.  If you do anything, come for the s'mores.    3.6 stars.... okay fiiiiiiiine... 4.
