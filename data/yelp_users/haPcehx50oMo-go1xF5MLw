I've been going to Hanrattys for a couple of years, and it's the best bar in Phoenix. Some people call it a dive bar - I call it your local neighborhood bar. The drinks are cheap and the service is excellent.  Megan, Terri and Mikey are the best bartenders around and they drinks are strong. Parking on the weekend can be tough, but you should be able to find a parking spot. If you're an Ohio State game, stop on in during college football games - they are an Ohio state bar.

They have PACZKI! Great place! I found this place on Fat Tuesday because I was looking for authentic Paczki's. As a Michigan transplant, celebrating Paczki Day was important? After asking around, all roads lead to Europa.   I felt like I was back in Polish town in Hamtramck. Very authentic feeling Polish cafe which I believe is run by a Polish family. Sausage, baked goods, perogi's, and all the works. The Polish music was very cool as well!

The food here is fantastic! Typically I go to Armadillo after work for a meal and cold beer. I normally get the Chicken Parmesan and substitute the marinara with the Pesto Cream sauce. I few cents extra but totally worth it.  The Mozzarella appetizer is fantastic too - 1/2 during happy hour. They freshly make these from scratch each time. The service is fantastic too. Normally I sit at the bar and order food and the bartenders have always been great.   It can be a little difficult to get to the parking lot from Camelback during rush hour, but it's not terrible. Highly recommended place to visit!

Postino is an amazing place to chill and relax with good company, good food, and amazing wine.   We had a nice Friday afternoon lunch outside with a glass a wine, and it was a perfect atmosphere. The Arcadia location makes you feel like you're in a small town rather than a city like Phoenix.   The cheese board - amazing!

Huge fan of Wong's. If you look at this place from the outside, it looks like it's condemned, but it's really good.   Normally I go there on the lunch hour and it fills up pretty quickly. Despite how it looks, it's very clean and safe. They have great lunch specials and I normally get the Orange Chicken, #15. With the lunch special, you get a cup of Egg Drop soup. Great service too. Even when they're busy I normally get my food very quickly and the staff is very attentive to their customers.   They offer takeout - just call and tell them what you want. Since they have limited seating takeout is always a good option.

The food here is pretty good but horrible service. We went for lunch on Monday and stopped in about 11:15. After ordering one person waited 50 minutes for their lunch. The table next to us waited just as long.   We asked where our food was each time the waitress came by and they said there was a problem. After asking the 4th time and asking to speak to a manager, they said the manager was busy.   If you don't mind waiting 50 plus minutes for lunch this is the place for you.

I love FEZ! Great trendy upbeat atmosphere. I've been here many times - brunch, lunch and dinner. The food and service is fantastic. I usually get the garlic hummus and pita as an appetizer and a burger for lunch. They're burgers are fantastic and you can taste the freshness. Nice outdoor seating area too.

Awesome atmosphere. When I went to Olive and Ivy, we just had drinks, however from what I understand, all of the Fox restaurants have excellent food.  I really liked the outdoor seating - right next to the Canal. Nice way to spend a Friday evening having drinks on the patio. And if I remember, they had very reasonable prices. Parking is not too bad, you'll probably end up parking at the garage next to Nordstrom.

Ar first I thought this place was a home, but once you get inside, it's such an amazing bar with great music! It's located in a great part of Phoenix, and has such a diverse crowd of people.   It does get crowded on occasion and it's tough to find parking, but the beer selection and prices make up for it.

Great place to go for lunch. If you order from the lunch menu, you'll spend less than $7! Normally I get the #3 - red. The service is spotty. During the busy lunch hour, sometimes I've had to ask for more chips 2-3 times before I get some. Sometime we have to wait a long time for the check too.   The food, though, pretty good. Try the hot salsa with your chips - it's some of the best salsa that I've ever had. They're also open early and it's a good place to swing by for a breakfast burrito or two.   Parking is not too bad - they have two separate parking lots which fill up during the lunch hour.

The McDowell Preserve (Gateway Access area)is one of my favorite places to hike. There are an infinite number of loops ranging from 1-2 miles, and for those ambitious people, 10+ mile loops.  The most popular trail is the Gateway Loop, which starting from the Access area is about 4.5 miles. There is a minor elevation gain/loss, and for the most part is very flat.   The trailhead has cold water fountains, maps, usually a park ranger, plenty of parking, and restrooms. Be sure to get a map - it helps, and bring plenty of water. Unlike Camelback, you'll never have to sit and wait for a parking spot.

I went here on a Friday night, and it's a great place to grab a drink and some excellent appetizers. The crowd was very trendy and the inside is upscale.   It's located near the Scottsdale Waterfront, and the downside of the location is the parking. We ended up parking at the parking garage that is located across from Olive and Ivy. It was free, and only a short walk.   We had a bit of a wait, and Friday nights tend to have louder and busier, for it was a nice place to start out for the evening.

You'll never find me rating a Starbucks lower than a 4, but this one is way too congested. Yes, the staff is friendly and it is convenient, the parking lot/drive through is a mess.   This Starbucks is a drive thru - walkup window only. On busy mornings, you'll find yourself backed up onto the street just trying to drive in. If you decide to walk up, you need to park your car and get out. The drive-thru lane and parking lot overlap, which makes it hard to back-up out of your parking spot.

Great place for happy hour or a weekend funday. The wings are totally awesome, highly recommended. They have an excellent selection of beers too. Great location and close to a lot of other downtown establishments.

LuLu's is great! Joe stops by our office weekly and it makes Wednesday's much more fun. He is always thinking of new and innovative flavors, which always turn out amazing! LuLu's recently added a Cappuccino Chocolate Swirl which is amazing - he also added a hot coffee float which is delicious. My favorite combination is Chocolate Bourdeaux and the prices are excellent.   Be sure to check it out at the Phoenix Public Market, and other areas around the Valley! You won't regret it!

Great place. They always introduce themselves with a name and a handshake. I quit smoking about a year ago because of vaping. If you're curious about eCigs, stop by here. They'll answer any question you have to get started. And the prices are great. You can get a starter kit for under $50 or $60. Totally recommend this place.

Started coming here a few months ago and really like it. It's a great place to go during the lunch hour. They have a great lunch menu and you generally get in an out pretty fast. If you go during the game, it can get really busy and service is slow. But - that's kind of expected with that many people stopping in.  Friendly staff and great beer selection. Nice outdoor seating as well.

I was very happy to see that a Panera opened in Phoenix. Panera was my favorite restaurant back in Michigan where I'm from, so I was glad to try it out.   The food is good and while I agree the price is a little high, it is comparable from what I remember. The problem is the service. It seems like the staff has no idea what they're doing and they get easily confused. While I was waiting for my takeout, they had to ask what I had. It took nearly 10 minutes to get my Chicken Caesar Salad, and the restaurant was slow. I suppose they were growing the lettuce from my salad from the garden because it took so long.   The staff is not rude - they're very friendly - just a lot of disorganization.

I love the new downtown location. When I first started vaping, I came here and had no idea about ejuices, vaping or anything else. The guys here are very knowledgable and made me feel comfortable.   They have a TON of ejuices that you can try for free, and pretty decent prices.

The food here was amazing. I went for lunch and started off with the pork belly appetizer. It was prepared perfectly and it was very filling.  For my entree, I had the Cajun Spiced Ahi Tuna sandwich with asparagus. The Ahi Tuna is prepared rare and tasted amazing. The asparagus was grilled and crunchy with a perfect amount of sea salt.   Great place to go for lunch. Ample seating both inside and the outside patio. Great service too.
