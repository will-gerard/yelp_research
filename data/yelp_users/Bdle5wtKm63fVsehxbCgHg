I am very pissed off and annoyed at this company. This company called me to set up a time for an x-ray I needed and I told the person that I am on a very limited budget so I needed to get preauthorization for the x-ray so I know how much to budget for it. He put me on hold and contacted my insurance. When I got back on the phone he told me that it would be $30 and that I could go in anytime to get it done.  Today when I got to the location, I was told that it was going to be $82. I told them I couldn't afford that and that is not what I was told. I eventually asked if they could discounted and I was told no. I've then offered to pay $50 for it but that was all I could afford. She went and made a call and eventually called me back up and said that they could give me a favor and split it into two payments but not discount it. I said no and after another call, she still refused to discount it for me.  Eventually I said I would pay it grudgingly and I grab my wallet out to pay cash. I was then told that they do not except US currency. They only except one form of payment which is visa. At that point I was furious and I stormed out. Newsflash, not everyone pays with visa!  I ended up spending an hour and a half on my one hour lunch, putting up with this crap for nothing. To say I am pissed off is an understatement. The only way they could make up for the crap they put me through is to give me my x-ray for free to pay for the hassle, gas and time for two trips over there. At most I would go back for the original agreed upon price of $30.

BEST DENTIST I'VE EVER HAD! Dr. Turner is an amazing dentist!  Been going to them for years now. I have to go way out of my way travel wise but it is very much worth it! I would recommend them to any of my friends and family!
