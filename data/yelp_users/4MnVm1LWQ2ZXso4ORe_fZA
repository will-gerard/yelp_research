I was actually pretty shocked to see any negative reviews for Fate on here.  The whole bun scenario listed a few reviews down sounds like a fiasco, but thankfully i've never had a negative experience there, and i've been there god only knows how many times.  Fate is my favorite restaurant.  i discovered it late one night (well, early morning, actually) after helping a friend shoot a burlesque show downtown.  I was amazed that they were open that late (I think it was one...maybe two A.M.?).  He insisted that I'd be amazed, and I was.    I have had to wait a few times to get in, but usually that was because it was First Friday.  It's understandable, because it's a small place (like most of the places downtown), and it's pretty popular.  Besides, you can always call ahead and make a reservation if you don't want to wait.  It's not a big deal.    The service the first time and each subsequent visit was excellent, and the food was brought out ridiculously fast.  The crab puffs are to die for, and I honestly have trouble narrowing down which martini is the best.  The pad thai martini is just amazingly weird enough to be good, but the spicy cucumber is out of this world.  I've tried a number of dishes, but I always come back to the spicy Saigon with shrimp.  I'm glad I don't live nearby, or I'd go there all the time.  This way it's always a treat when I go.

I thought I didn't like Macayo's. Typically, I'm not a fan of chain restaurants, and because of the heavy Hispanic/Chicano population in the Southwest, we have a multitude of Mexican restaurants to choose from.  But it was good. I went with a group of friends recently. I monkey see-monkey do-'ed and ordered what my friend ordered. The cheese enchilada was tasty, and the beef tamale with baja sauce. Oh yes. Das ist gut. I mean, muy bien.   I went again a little over a month ago with a dear friend during lunch, and it was even better than the last time. We were cozied in a booth in the back, with a darling older blonde lady as our waitress. She was chatty and pleasant. My friend ordered a margarita in one of the fancy mugs for him to take back to Utah. I ordered a conconutty margarita, which was mighty tasty with lots of coconut on the rim and in the drink, as well as a hefty chunk of pineapple inside, as well. Excellent!  The waitress was attentive but respected our space. The chips and salsa were uber fresh. They were so good, I could have come just for chips and salsa + a margarita. The food came very quickly, piping hot and the presentation was just so. Our lovely lady loaded us up with napkins (not gonna lie, I am a napkin hog), and we got to it. I ordered the tamale with baja sauce, and it was heavenly. We took our time to eat and sat in the booth with our food babies for awhile after we finished. The food was great and it was a nice experience. Looks like I need to chill on my chain restaurant snobbery, because I'll definitely be back.

Well, there are two reasons to go to AJ's: you have plenty of money to waste, or you're looking for a certain product that's not sold elsewhere. My friend and I came in for the latter the other day: me, for some of my favorite foaming bath, and she, for some flowers.  Avoid this store at ALL costs in the afternoon. It's rich kid hell. A mob of Xavier girls fills the patio and coffee area, while even more clog up the lines inside.   My friend gave me said flowers because I was having a rough pain day. She handpicked the bouquet. The florist beheaded one of the flowers and impaled it with floral wire, and it was dead by the time I got home. The other flowers only lived for about a day. I was pretty surprised, because when I buy flowers at Trader Joe's, they survive much longer.  I'm sad to say, AJ's is phasing out the Fruits & Passions line. Well, now that Wal-Mart carries Nathan's Famous pickles and I won't be able to buy my bath products here anymore, I don't suppose I'll have to stop by this place at all. What a shame.

This place has absolutely terrible customer service. It is nearly impossible to get assistance, unless you're a big mouthed fat WASP who reeks of money. I was overlooked while I was in the process of faxing some documents because both employees at the counter assisted said WASP while he stood and assessed his his display. It was very disappointing.

This place is Christmas when it comes to crafty things to discover. There is fabric of every kind, nick-nacks, ribbon, and kitschy things. The employees, though? Oh my gosh grouchy. Forget getting help or friendly service here. Even the guy at the front clearly doesn't want to be here.  Also, be prepared--this is a warehouse setting with poor ventilation. You will get hot and sweaty.  But I found the materials for some projects for super cheap, which was great. That concrete floor did a number on my back, though, because I walked around the entire store. The heating pad was calling my name when I got home.

I'm not going to lie; I wanted to go to this Denny's solely because of Jetta R.'s review.  Bad, bad, bad.  Bad service, bad food, bad experience.  I took my friend here twice to make sure that the first time wasn't just a fluke.  Our waitress was a total space cadet and was completely uninterested in us.  I realize Denny's isn't a high class restaurant, but I do subscribe to the belief that your water glass should never be empty.  We put our glasses at the end of the table.  The waitress flitted around at the tables behind us (there were two, maybe three other tables occupied when we visited, tops), but didn't cater to our needs.  She treated us like children on both visits.  I told my friend, "the tip meter is running."  I wanted to like Jenny's, but it just sucked.  There's no reason for crappy service with a place as empty as it was.

Why, hello, 99 cent margaritas.    I used to go here with a friend when I lived in the Biltmore area a year or so ago, and I lived and breathed off the shrimp and scallops del mar.  Nowadays, another friend and I like to frequent Arriba for their happy hour margaritas.  The chips and salsa are excellent, and although the servers speak hardly a lick of English, service is generally pretty good.  The food leaves something to be desired, excepting the shrimp and scallops del mar, as well as the chips and dip, but the drinks and service are awesome.  It's just the right place to drop by after a crappy day at work.

CVS is pretty standard, right? Pharmacy, overpriced beauty section (but you sure avoid going to Ulta if you can find what you're looking for there), great sales--on booze, on food, stationery, games--whatever. When I lived across the street, I used to come here at night when I was bored and it wasn't busy. Now, though, there are new employees and unfair practices. On more than one occasion, the employees have held sale items for themselves behind the counter. Today, there were no Connect Four on the shelf, but there was one in the cart behind the counter. When the manager was asked about it, she shrugged and pointed at another employee. I've worked in retail before, and this goes against most store policies.   So, the next time you get a CVS flyer, remember that if it's okay for the employees to shop the sales for themselves here--then it might be happening all over the place. And if they can put one item behind the counter for themselves, then they can put a lot more for their friends. Prepare to be disappointed. Make the extra trip and hit up Wal-Mart.

The egg drop soup is delicious, as is the house chicken. The serving sizes are generous. The inevitable swollen fingers the next day? Worth it.

I've only been here a couple of times, but both times, there was hardly any wait, and the employees were very friendly. Nicole was very kind and efficient, and understanding about paying with some change. Awesome place for a quick, greasy, guilty pleasure!

I love that this place delivers! I ordered a strawberry-walnut-chicken salad, and was not disappointed. The vinaigrette was divine, and the chicken charbroiled just so. I also ordered bruschetta, expecting a couple small slices of bread with a tiny bit of tomatoes on it. It came in a normal sized takeaway container. I was flabbergasted. Inside, were pieces upon pieces of toasted bread, topped with delicious tomatoes, garlic, basil, and cheese. Holy moly. It was enough to share with at least two other friends. Yum!

The store itself is fairly unremarkable, but the employees are very helpful and typically have great attitudes. There is always too much conditioner and too little shampoo, but it comes at a cheap price for name brands. There is an eclectic food section, and the furniture selection is actually not bad for what I consider a discount store.

Half off during tweaker hours! No, really. The washers are half off from 2300 to 0700. That's what drew me in. It helps that the caretakers take excellent care of the laundromat, excluding its creepy, creepy bathroom. There are also arcade games to be played and the inevitable televangelist bellowing from the television set (don't worry, they'll let you change it if you'd like to). So glad I found this gem on Cave Creek.

Forget the pho; their spring rolls are unbelievable.  Okay, don't forget the pho-- I would recommend getting it with charbroiled shrimp.  Mmmm.  Service is speedy, prices reasonable, and the food is tasty.  No complaints here.

This isn't the kind of neighborhood you want to be in too long after dark, but the store is fairly clean and feels less "uppity" than other Target stores. I prefer the beauty section layout here to the Christown Target. The cashiers are talkative, and the soft pretzel was delicious.

Banner Thunderbird is, hands down, the best hospital I have been to in the Phoenix area. Chandler Regional is a close second. The grounds and architecture are lovely, and just about all of the staff--from doctors to techs to janitors--are extremely warm and friendly.  I have been to the ER once and was treated with the utmost of concern and kindness. My doctor and nurse were thoroughly invested in helping me. I was actually amazed. As a chronically ill person, I experience a lot of interaction with medical professionals, and it seems that most are jaded against AHCCCS patients, and treat us like second class citizens. This was not the case at Banner Thunderbird.  I am now going through aquatic therapy with the outpatient department, and I have been once again impressed by the kindness and empathy that is extended to me. I have not noticed a change since I began, but the sessions themselves are tremendously relieving. I'm grateful there is a place in Phoenix that operates with this kind of integrity.

i've been going to Crazy Jim's for eons.  the place is more crowded than it used to be, but our waitress, Myrna, ensured that we had absolutely everything we needed and that our drinks were never, ever even close to empty.  my friend marveled over the fresh, sticky feta in her gyro with feta.  i was on a hummus kick, so i marveled over the freshly prepared hummus.  even on a busy night, the staff was attentive.  the food was excellent, and the prices reasonable.  i left a hefty tip for our waitress.  the meal, ambience, and service was worth every penny.

I guess I'm a one trick pony--at parties, I teach dirty words in sign language. When I go out to eat with someone I care about, it's usually to Crazy Jim's.   I have gone here twice with dates, a couple of times with friends over the last year or two.  Interestingly enough, I was able to contrast the difference between when I went with another woman, and when I went with a man.  The staff is impeccable.  They flutter around like hummingbirds, seeing if we need anything. The night I went with my lady friend, some of the patrons were not so friendly. She, as a butch, was of course, quite obviously gay, and me, as I guess, a femme by default (now I'm going to be thinking about how to label myself, great). But the interesting thing is, the old couple that sat next to us of course, stared at us, even though we weren't bringing any kind of attention to ourselves, and it was at my friend that the old man glared disapprovingly.   Anyway, I digress. I've moved on from the hummus and gyros, and I'm kind of just obsessed with the saganaki. I love the pizzazz that the girls (or the boss) have when they pour the Bacardi on the feta and light it. It's quite a show if you'd like to impress your date. It's mighty tasty, as well.  I've been going to Crazy Jim's for years, and they still are just as good as the first time I walked in. It's hard to say that about many things these days.

Scummy area that smacks of bad news, but the staff has remarkable work ethic and the pizza is predictably good. I dig the crazy bread best. I would like to try the deep dish sometime. The gal working the register exchanged some small talk about hair dye and was really personable. The pizza and breadsticks didn't take long, and was the usual greasy + tasty combo I expect at Little Caesar's.

I can't really afford to shop at Albertson's, but there are a few grocery items that they do best--including their store brand frozen pizza, boneless chicken wings, and I like their alcohol selection, too. The real reason I ever shop here, though, is that the customer service is the best of any store in town. The employees are genuinely nice and extremely helpful. Anyone from a stocker to a manager will go the extra mile to help a customer. It's a pleasant experience.

As a girl who was raised in Arkansas, I do, from time to time, get a hankerin' for fried chicken. I didn't feel like going to the store, washing dishes, etc, so I headed to this KFC.  KFC has changed a lot since I was a kid. It seems a lot cleaner. And I certainly don't recall not one, not two, but three cameras at the registers. But that's the world we live in, I guess.   Regardless, this particular location is extremely clean, the employees seem to actually enjoy their jobs, and the food is made pretty quickly. In fact, last night, Vanessa actually special-ordered some chicken tenders to be made a la original recipe, instead of crispy, which is the only way listed on the menu. How nice!  The sides now come in reusable containers. So reuse them! There's no sense in putting more trash in our landfills if you can reuse them...for food, crafts, cannabis...whatever.  Side note: in Cabot, Arkansas, KFC has a buffet. And a chicken liver meal. The buffet, I could do without, but I could dig some liver every once in awhile. Hint hint.

You know what?  I love Dillard's.  I love this chain.  I used to work for them when I first moved to Arizona, actually, and while I quit it almost immediately (let's face it, some people just hate retail work), I've always liked their selection.  Their pricing can be fair, and it's just a step between Sears/JC Penney and Neiman Marcus.  It's a good middle place.  But the Dillard's in Scottsdale Fashion Square is the PITS.  I went here the other day on my lunch break.  I was actually thinking of shelling out some serious cash just to get a pair of jeans that would last awhile and look good.    I walked by not one, not two, not even three, but SIX employees who did NOT offer to help me in any way.  One even looked at me with her eyebrow raised like she thought I was going to steal something!  Was it because I was in no makeup and glasses?  Would I have had better customer service if I'd come in wearing my contacts, makeup, and a skirt?  Seriously, people...I assume it's the same as when I worked there several years back--that pay is dependent on both the hourly wage and also the sales rung up.  Are you honestly going to tell me that SIX employees had no interest in a woman carrying around a pair of $100 jeans?  I just shrugged and got a pair of Levi's instead.

Come all ye barbies, all ye roid monkeys, all ye hopeful trophy wives to be.  Oh yes, this is the place to ogle, in this gym peppered with a maelstrom of high pitched valley girl voices, the infamous bubble gum blower girl who hops on each machine for five minutes at a time, then leaves to watch herself in the mirror, and also populated by men with perfectly gelled hair wearing their shades inside.  Stay far, far away during the after work rush on mondays; you'll be waiting for machines and willing the barbies to just give you your damn turn.  Clientele aside, with the amount of equipment and two levels, it's a pretty solid bet for personal fitness if you're like me and don't give a crap what anyone else thinks.

This is my favorite Big Lots. There is so much weird stuff to be found here. The food section alone is astounding in its randomness. There are lots of quirky home decor items, including mega soft body pillows (siiiiigh), owl coffee mugs, and nutty signs to hang around the house. The employees, for the most part, are very helpful, and the lines aren't typically very long.

I really like Durant's.  A couple of my best memories were made here.  I've had the coconut shrimp and also the crab; both were fantastic.   i've also gone there just for drinks, and i have to say that Durant's is probably the best place to sit down and talk over drinks with a friend.  It's like entering a different world.  It's just so cozy, with those low lights and plush red velvet.  I especially loved it because with the two of us at the bar, it felt like we were the only two people in the world.  The staff is so incredibly attentive, and the bartender is very jovial and friendly.

Moving from Indian School to this building was a terrible idea. Zia used to have kitschy, rare, interesting inventory. Now, the store is an old CVS building, with terrible ambience. The friendly, indie vibes are all but gone, and the stuff they carry is crap from romance novels to mainstream films. There are still obscure fun items near the checkout, but it's not the same. It's like the girlfriend with a special, unique look...who went and got a tit job and a nose job while she was at it. Now she giggles with a vacant look in her eyes. I go here every once in awhile, but I prefer half.com or amazon instead.

Oh heavens.  I think of this place when I'm at work on a stressful day, willing my bottled water to morph into a chocolate Delux martini.  I am on pins and needles waiting for their new location to open on Scottsdale and Camelback so it'll be just a hop, skip, and a jump away from work.    I'll admit it: I've never had a Delux burger.  Oh, I've had their sweet potato fries and orgasmic chipotle sauce; I've had their French vanilla and chocolate martinis; I've been there in both the afternoon and the evening.  But I stick to what I know and love, and that's the caprese salad (or, "tomato mozzarella salad," as it's listed on the menu).  It really doesn't get much better than that.    The ambience is hip and cozy, my favorite spot being not the booths or the bar, but the long blue lit table in the middle, where you have a bird's eye view of the whole room.  It's a good spot to sit and drink and watch the sun go down.  I used to go here with one of my best friends, who recently passed.  I wasn't sure how I'd handle it, going back for the first time since he's been gone, what with the times we'd had there fairly permeating throughout the place.  However, the bittersweet nostalgia was quickly squelched by the idiocy of our waitress, who clearly was not aware of what planet she was on.  She was harmless and sweet enough, but not very bright.  She had to ask us several times for our order, and then brought out the wrong things.  She even brought one of my friends a coke without rum when she had very clearly had enunciated her choice of beverage.  It took her at least half an hour to come back and check on us, at which point she didn't note our empty glasses and listlessly said something vague about how she didn't know when our food would be out.  Frankly, I was embarrassed, because having been there numerous times with impeccable, speedy service, I was worried about my friends to whom I was introducing Delux for the first time thinking that the service was utter crap.  I laughed nervously and remarked to my friends in a low voice that the "tip meter" was running.  Thankfully, the sweet potato fries were amazing, and we tried to eat them slowly as our stomachs rumbled during almost an hour while we waited for our food.  When the entrees came out, my guests were duly impressed by the quality of the cuisine and quickly forgot the ditz waitress, albeit an empty drink or two...or three.  In summation, the food is excellent, and the martinis are even better.  But perhaps nowadays the service is touch and go.  I'll have to go back and reassess.

Well! I guess six years was enough time to take to reassess this place and dang! has it improved. I went with an incredible friend of mine from out of state. He had the 4 Peaks beer flight, which he said was mighty tasty. I started with the French vanilla martini, and eventually ended the visit with a dirty martini. Both were exceptionally good.  I still dug the blue low-lit ambience quite a bit. This night's waitress was young and cheery, brought everything out very quickly with ease. The caprese salad was even better than I believe even before, as well as the sweet potato fries and aoli sauce, which I promptly ate like Oliver Twist. My friend had a burger, which he seemed to enjoy, and the presentation of which was colorful and aesthetically pleasing.  The only disappointment was the lack of cucumber vodka that was listed on the website. I'm always looking for new places to try cucumber martinis. Beyond that, it was a truly lovely evening. My faith in this place has been restored.

I come here every once in awhile. I bought my first Pynchon book here, and I love perusing the New Age section.  The staff is so freakin' nice! Good grief! If there's anything you need, they'll help you with it. Unfortunately, I live in the age of half.com and I'm usually too cheap to buy any books at a bookstore--even this one. If I can get it for 75 cents plus shipping and handling, I don't want to pay $8 for it at Bookman's. But they do have an awesome boardgame section, and the lesbian eye candy is cream of the crop. Go here for the atmosphere and the random finds, as well as the little kitschy things by the checkout. If I were able to stand for long periods of time, I might even apply for a job here because the vibe is so friendly.

Super crowded and chaotic on a busy night; nice and comfy on a slow one.  Either way, it's fantastic.  The vibe is electric and the clientele are bound to be at least half as weird as you are.  This is the perfect place to go  with a friend, or to strike up conversations with strangers, sipping some ice cold beer.

Goodness gracious alive, do I ever love this place.  I head out to U.S. Egg a couple of Sundays a month with my roomie and her pops.  We are seated speedily, and any number of leggy beauties are at our beck and call for the entirety of our stay.  The owner is gracious, and the waitresses are perpetually smiling.  The vibe is light.  The clientele runs from old folks to hipsters to the hangover crowd.  The menu has quite a bit to choose from, but I always have the spinach florentine (try it; i promise you won't regret it).   I've heard tell that the veggie benedict and eggs over easy are remarkable, as well.    Servers leave a pitcher of ice cold water with us as we eat--they don't pester us or rush us or hint that we need to leave, even when our conversations run long.  I can't think of a better place to get breakfast.

There is plenty of room for dogs to run and socialize while the owners sit and chat. There is even a smaller park for small dogs, as well. I like that it's open until 10 PM, but there seems to be some issue with upkeep: one time, the place was locked at 5 PM--and no evidence of any irrigation, so that rules that out--and the other night, we came by at 8 PM and all the lights were out. "It feels like we're walking into a horror movie," I teased my friend. Thankfully, we weren't alone; there was another dog owner who braved the darkness to let his pup get some exercise.  The dog parks in Phoenix can't seem to compare to the ones in Los Angeles, but then again, they don't really have to. I like the Petsmart dog park, and the friendly dog owners that meet there, too.

I recently visited the ER for a migraine and subsequent vomiting due to a sinus infection and bronchitis. I was ushered in to a whole room of my own, and a nurse covered me in several warm blankets. I was very touched by her kindness. The doctor was kind and had a sparkle in his eyes. I was taken care of and dicharged all within an hour. Bless this place.  The waiting room was occupied by only a handful of folks, mostly worse for the wear, which is to be expected at an ER in an unfortunate neighborhood. I am definitely making this my hospital.

I have the spine of a 60 year old and what can only be described as a schizophrenic nervous system (thanks for the genes, Mom & Dad!). To say I'm always in pain is putting it lightly. I have regular days in which my pain is too great to be able to walk or do much than lie in bed. I cannot walk farther than 1/4 mile, and I haven't been able to work since 3/13. I've been getting really sick of pills and specialists, of procedures that don't work, and generally losing hope. Thankfully, I have faith, so I'm still plugging. Anyway, a friend gifted me by covering a massage, and I, having been all my friends' personal (amateur) masseuse, figured it was a good idea, especially since it would be my first.  I was worried about three things beforehand: 1) being triggered (PTSD) from being touched by a stranger 2) making the noises I usually do when I'm getting rubbed down (they can send a neighbor three doors over into Bonertown) and 3) falling asleep (and snoring like a bear--I'm congested). None of these things happened. It was a really pleasant experience.   The lobby was nicely decorated, with chairs of various shapes, sizes, and colors. Products on the wall that I didn't need, three friendly, if frazzled ladies working the front, and I also spotted some pink fuzzy socks (OMG LOOK AWAY, KATIE, LOOK AWAY). The paperwork was brief and to the point. I didn't have to draw x's or slashes to indicate what hurt and in what manner. Bonus. I'm not sure if I've mentioned this in other reviews, but I'm terribly clumsy, socially awkward, and, ah, my self esteem wanes high and low. Luckily, neither the employees nor the clientele were of the Snobsdale vibe, and I wasn't feeling too much like a neolithic cavebeast around them.   I was assigned to Eric, a softspoken dark haired chap who talked gently and asked what my problem areas were. I explained my lower lumbar, SI joint, and legs are pretty much always in horrific pain. I stripped down to my dykey skivvies and lay on the table under the sheet. I spend a lot of time on tables like this, and just like every other time, I felt akin to Moby Dick, flopped in all my bulbuous glory. I had a moment before the masseur returned  to recall my flaws--stretch marks, purple spider bite scar, and the zit the size of Austria that appeared on my neck yesterday. Thanks God--just keeping me humble.  The massage was soothing, much slower and purposeful than the horny hands of latter days. Different means to different ends, you know. I felt absolutely comfortable in the dark room with quiet music and ambience. Luckily, he didn't get any of my tickle spots except my feet, which always amuses the ladies giving me pedicures because I kick like a donkey. Additionarlly, my appointment didn't end nearly as quickly as I thought it would, and I enjoyed it very much.  The ladies up front offered me a membership package, but they weren't pushy, and they didn't insist on me scheduling another appointment just then. I was a little dismayed that the followed appointments would cost $60 instead of $40, but that's just because I'm not working, and money's very tight. When I walked to the bus stop, my joints and movement felt much more fluid, and I felt a little lighter since I wasn't as stiff as I normally am. I hear tomorrow's going to be killer, but today was nice. Would recommend, and will go again.

This is the cleanest, quietest, most stocked Wal-Mart in the valley, and it doesn't hurt that the drive to the store is lovely. Having said that, the craft department ladies don't know where anything is, and the cashiers at the checkout can be mighty frosty. Go here to shop, not to socialize.

I call this place the Narnia Fry's. It's so diverse and expansive, it's a bit like the old C.S. Lewis setting. There is a cooking school, a restaurant, a bookstore area, a jewelry store...you name it. Boringly enough, I typically swing by for the delicious salad bar. It's a bit pricey, but so good. The sushi bar is a good pick, too. The produce section is to die for, and the booze goes on forever.

The employees seem to be unhappy to be working here. I only go to this location when I want to run in and run out.

If you care about your health and your family's health, you will NOT bring them here.  I found 1st Care Family Medical Clinic on accident. My dad looked up a physician that used to be at this clinic MANY many years ago, and for some reason, it brought up 1st Care instead of her current practice. I was in so much pain, I figured it was close and it didn't matter.  WRONG. I saw Dr. Chettri for nearly a year, and this diminutive little man with a terrible attitude was a misogynist of the worst kind. He continuously inferred and told me that my ailments were in my head. When he finally sent me for x-rays, nothing showed up, and he extremely grudgingly gave me Tylenol 3, with a humiliating speech about drug addiction and basically telling me he didn't think I needed it at all. In the meantime, my condition worsened so greatly that I could no longer walk 1/4 mile without my back spasming, or "locking up," and the pain was too great to walk any farther. Dr. Chettri continued to treat me as if I were a simple little woman and it was all in my head. Eventually he finally sent me to the CORE Institute, where I saw a spine surgeon and was sent for an MRI.   It turned out I have degenerative disc disease, a bulging disc, and a herniated disc. The spine surgeon at CORE Institute sent me to physical therapy, and when that exacerbated the problem, I was referred to a pain management doctor, and I switched primary care physicians, thank God.   Every single time I went to 1st Care Family Medical, I was treated like a second class citizen. The office is FILTHY--disgusting!! The receptionists are inundated with calls and work. Nearly every time I went, I wanted to leave, but it was easier than urgent care and frankly, I was worried the next clinic I went to might be worse (if that's even possible). One tech is very nice and professional; the other is easily flustered and doesn't seem to know how to interact with women. That may be part of his cultural upbringing, though, and he was never disrespectful.   I would never, ever recommend anyone go to this clinic. Dr. Chettri is a shameful, misogynistic jerk, and my condition was prolonged and worsened because I subjected myself to this awful clinic.

My gf ordered a calzone with fresh mushrooms and sausage, and I ordered an antipasto salad. The calzone was huge-the size of a pizza! But there was no ricotta to be found inside. How bizarre. Also bizarre was the option of canned mushrooms in said calzone. Who would actually choose that? My salad was delicious, albeit skimpy on the pepperoni (I had two slices). The salad dressing that accompanied my order was generous. I had ordered an extra dressing for today's leftovers, but ended up not needing it. Our order together cost less than $20. Will definitely try again!

Barbie escaped the dollhouse to serve us our food tonight.  Ken was nowhere in sight and her squeaky, chirpy voice asked us if there was anything we wanted.  Well, silverware is awesome.  We got our drinks (albeit the water refills were a little slow on the upswing), and waited some time for the food.  The food arrived, but, uh, no silverware.  How does one eat hash browns if not with a fork?  "Oh!" the waitress shrieked.  The couple behind us babbled loudly in Spanish and ate their food with their silverware while our biscuits, eggs, and hash browns grew cold.  Cars passed by.  A cop car pulled into the parking lot and a ghetto bird flew overhead.  Finally we got some silverware and attempted to dig in.  My friend Patty made a face as she bit into her fries.  Soggy, soggy, soggy.  She slathered Tabasco sauce on them in an attempt to revive them from their soggy slumber.  My biscuits and gravy were pretty typical; I wouldn't have expected more from a Denny's.  The hash browns could have been more crisp, but they were okay, I guess.  The waitress slammed things on the counter as we left after I paid her 10% for her nonattentive, non-cup filling, non-silverware dispensing service.   Classy.  P.S. Patty would like to note that her boyfriend got food poisoning and spent the night puking.  Just sayin'.

I went here during the Mexican American artwork exhibit.  The exhibit was full of diverse, remarkable pieces, including an entire vintage kitchen.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  The entire layout of the building was simple and modern.  I have gone twice since the first visit.  It's a good trip for a lazy day in Tempe.

This is my Wal-Mart. I used to go to the Christown Wal-Mart before I discovered this one, and the difference is vast. I have heard *one* screaming baby in the entire time I've frequented this store, no yelling and chaos over the intercom, and about 80% less stupid people crowding the aisles. This store is rarely out of things, except they don't seem to stock the beauty section often enough. Definitely a cleaner, calmer version of Wal-Mart than I'm accustomed to.

This is such a wonderful park. I used to do laps around this place when I needed to go think by myself. I went back recently and enjoyed the breeze, water, and scenery. It's so serene.

This Wal-Mart is so terrible. The lines (including the fast checkout) are regularly wrapped all the way back to the clothing section. I seem to almost always get nearly trampled when I stop here, even despite the cane (hello, people!). The cashiers are robots, the selection is meager, and the bathroom is disgusting.  The good thing, though, is that the old crafts sales lady lets me cut the ribbon by 1/2 yard instead of a full yard. I make my cat handmade collars, and I don't need a whole yard. :)

A friend and I drove over to the other side of town to try Mr. Sushi, per the recommendation of her brother.  We waited twenty minutes for the waiter to come to our table.  Then it took an hour and twenty more minutes to get the food.  By the time the sushi arrived, we were starving.  The presentation was excellent, and I was anticipating some excellent sushi goodness.  Wrong.  I looked at my friend and said, "this tastes like it came out of the LA River."  She agreed.  We paid the bill and left most of the food still on the plates.  It was completely unpalatable.  What a disappointment.

Pho Thanh is settled in the corner of a little strip mall off 19th Ave and Camelback. I've passed it numerous times, but never stopped in. What a delight.   The lighting is great and cheery, and the restaurant itself is big and roomy. The staff is meticulous and helpful. I always get the same thing when I get pho, regardless of restaurants, but the expansive menu gave me pause.   I went here with a fellow nerdy friend. We both got spring rolls-him, vegetarian, me shrimp. Oh my goodness. Amazing. The peanut sauce was good (although, shhhh, Pei Wei's sauce is better), and the rolls were crazy fresh. Jose said that his rolls were great, as well.  Jose ordered some fancy curry pho, which he said was good, but remarked that he wished the chicken wasn't still on the bone. I always hope for charbroiled shrimp on my pho, but they only had boiled. I chose that, and it was good. As per the usual with pho, the serving sizes were massive, and I got full pretty quickly. I was surprised that carrots didn't come with the mint and sprouts, but it was still good. Our server was attentive and made sure the water was full. Although, be warned--when you order soda (like my friend did), it's a can of soda, not from a fountain!  All the staff is congenial, the food is great, the prices are extremely reasonable, and the spring rolls are out of this world. Will definitely go back!

My bestie recently bought a Jeep and wanted to go for a mini roadtrip, so we headed up to Happy Valley. We hit up Wal-Mart, because that one's the best one, I think, in Phoenix, then Petco. We were hungry, and I wanted a salad, so the gal at Petco recommended the Mellow Mushroom.   Dang!  Excellent ambience, customer service, music, atmosphere. We were only ordering to go, but I think we'll definitely be back to sit and stay awhile. The guy that greeted us at the door was upbeat and helpful. He led us to the perky gal with glasses and an updo at the to-go station. We ended up getting salads and a pizza, because it all looked so good. I got a small Greek salad. So much ham and sprouts! Wow! When we got home, I dumped it on one of my big oblong plates, and it filled up the whole stinkin' thing. We ordered the Holy Shiitake pie--omg amazing. The smell of garlic wafted through my whole house as the dog salivated (from a respectful distance). The pizza was covered with shiitake, button, and Portobello mushrooms, plus caramelized onions, mozzarella, and Montamore cheeses. Downright decadent, right? But that's not all. The pie is drizzeled with garlic aioli and black truffle oil. Seriously? Truffle oil? Goodness gracious alive.  Luckily, there was no sucking of face scheduled for that evening, because the garlic breath just would. not. die. But it was a small price to pay for a top notch meal.

Good God, talk about the longest, weakest pedicure ever. I was already at the mall, and thought I'd spoil myself by getting the first pedicure I'd had in awhile. First off, the water was cold, and when one of the employees adjusted it, it was still tepid. Secondly, the massaging chair? Didn't massage. I don't know if they only turned it on to the rocket launch setting for folks who had both hands and feet done, but the guy who did my nails ignored me come-puh-LEET-ly as he was doing his thing, and didn't seem to understand me when I asked him a question.   I went for the sloughing of mes pieds because I go barefoot all the time. So, the nail tech pulled out what appeared to be a cheese grater. He went to town after he soaked my feet in some goo and wrapped them in saran wrap. When he was finished, he shook the item in question in the aforementioned cold water, cleaned it, and left it in the foot bath with my feet for awhile. I know it's my dead skin, but I didn't really want to have it floating around in the water with me.   The nail tech failed to mention that white tips were extra when he asked me what color I wanted, so I was startled when the cost of the pedicure was $10 more than the sign outside proclaimed. I was willing to pay extra for the grooming of my hillbilly feet, but a heads up about the extra $5 for white tips would have been awesome.  Finally, he finished, wandered off, and he just let me sit there. I wasn't even sure if this guy was coming back, or if someone else is going to remove the cotton from between my feet and give me some gnarly flip flops. When he did come back eventually, I was so bored and restless, I was mad I had to pay $27 for something I could have done at home, braless and comfortable, with some freakin' WARM water. My friend and I paid him and hightailed it out of there.  Bottom line: Forget these schmucks. I'm glad I did some maintenance on my lovely feet, but I will definitely yelp where I'm going before I patronize the place!

I stayed here for several days while waiting for my new apartment to be ready for move-in. I was first put in a non-smoking room on the first floor that REEKED of cat piss! I moved to a double room on the second floor. It was much cleaner. I love that Motel 6 is pet friendly. There was plenty of room for the dog and cat to roam, a giant desk, a cot, and an archaic television that, strangely, turns off every forty minutes. The channels are limited, but plenty for me.   There were all kinds of scratches in the sink, and only one trash can in the room. The tub was extra comfy. I paid for wifi, but it didn't work, and I was given a refund. I heard another person getting a refund, too.  The motel itself is pretty quiet during both day and night. It wasn't even bad on Friday and Saturday nights. I didn't have my room cleaned, but housekeeping knocked on my door after I had called downstairs and specified no housekeeping. Then, the guy in question knocked again and asked if he could come back in half an hour! Wtf?  There is security at night, which is good, because there were some rough looking characters about. I saw one of the vagrants get arrested, too.  Is it the best area? Nope. But it was good for a short stay. Make sure you grab a bite to eat next door at Burger Mania!

This store is overwhelming. It's the poor man's Costco/Sam's Club. The prices were cheaper when it first opened (holy hummus, Batman), but everything's still pretty cheap. I don't go here a lot because I've found I end up buying things I don't really need (because I MIGHT NEED IT ONE DAY, IT'S SO CHEAP). haha. I also can't carry much at a time because of my back, and I was always buying more than I should carry, so I've acquiesced to Wal-Mart shopping, despite my misgivings about corporate greed, etc etc. It's a great store if you have the time, the money, and a friend or a car to help you carry the bags home.

If you care about your health or your family's health, absolutely do not go here. I was cycled through three PA's during my time with this clinic. The first was actually pretty knowledgable, but fled the practice for the likes of urgent care. The second PA didn't know what planet she was on, and the third put me on medication I didn't need that made me horrifically ill. I finally got out of dodge and found myself a proper internist. I'd recommend the same for anyone considering this godforsaken clinic.

What a letdown. I've been to the Pita Jungle on Indian School, which was alright, and the one in Tempe, which was really awesome with excellent food and quirky servers...and then there's this one. I guess I shouldn't have built it up so much for my friend, because it was really an awful experience.  Our server (Kimberly, I believe her name was), was horrid and unfriendly, speaking to us like we were beneath her-I'm assuming because my friend is clearly butch and didn't fit into this gal's ideal clientele. She was extremely unhelpful. We ordered appetizers and wraps--chicken shawarma for me, gyro for my friend. The server made it clear she couldn't wait for us to leave. She offered us to go boxes within ten minutes of receiving our food. It was shocking for me. I don't get a lot of snooty attitude because I'm feminine and the only thing out of the ordinary is the fact that I sometimes walk with a cane. Maggie and I took a moment to regroup, focus on the food, and not the nasty demeanor of our waitress. We weren't going to let it get in the way of a good meal.  Except it wasn't. I don't know what kind of shawarma they were serving that day, but it wasn't the Pita Jungle deliciousness I'm accustomed to. It tasted more like fast food than an awesome Middle Eastern dish. The cilantro jalapeno hummus was okay, but the pita was hard. The cucumber slices were tasty and fresh, and the Purple Haze beer we shared was good. The lettuce in Maggie's gyro was wilted and gross. She picked that out, but the gyro was still sub par. I tried it myself, and it was meh, too.  I will say that the guy who ran the food from the kitchen to the table was super friendly, and the other waiter seemed alright. But as far as this place goes, between the hateful waitress and the mediocre food, I was really disappointed. I thought Pita Jungle was better than this.

I love Zella's! They were persistent, taping ads to my door week after week, and I finally caved. The prices are extremely reasonable, and although I've only tried the sandwiches and salads, I can vouch for their tastiness. Zella's is my go-to delivery place. Try the Italian sub; you won't regret it.

I've been to Desert Valley Radiology two or maybe even three times, and always get the same great service. In and out, regardless of how busy they are, and whether I've made an appointment or not. I would say that Tuesday/Wednesday early morning seems to be pretty slow, so that's handy. The front desk folks and super friendly, as well as patient and informed. Paperwork doesn't take too long.   The radiology technicians are wonderful and respectful, gentle and patient. I will probably always use this business if I need to have radiology work done.

I hurt nonstop, sometimes all over my body, due to chronic illness, and I am often treated like a hypochondriac when I do actually go in for something unbearable. But  this afternoon, when I buckled over with pain and nausea, I went in to the new Nextcare on Northern & 19th Ave.   The good news was, the place was empty. The lobby was spacious and clean, with lovely natural light streaming through the windows. Both the gal at the front desk and the triage tech were helpful. The nurse practitioner, however, made me nervous immediately, with an unnatural joking manner that seemed forced, and didn't bother veiling his skepticism. I explained to him that I am always in pain, but I have had a couple instances that I have had UTI's that spread because I don't have many symptoms until it's too late. My creatinine levels had also been slightly abnormal when I recently had labs done, so I was concerned that with the severity of my symptoms that kidney stones or a kidney infection was also a possibility. I wasn't trying to give him a grocery list, or anything, but I have major anxiety whenever I go to the doctor, so I always try to prepare properly so as to avoid me just saying, "I hurt." I didn't want pain pills, I just wanted to be in and out with some antibiotics if I was indeed sick.  The NP predictably treated me just as I had feared. I regretted even coming in. This has not been the case at the Nextcare clinic on Thomas and 20th St, so I had truly hoped for the same quality service.  If you're stranded or nearby this urgent care, I guess you could try it. But I don't think I will again.

Excellent service here. The building is clean, aesthetically pleasing inside and out, the folks registering patients are congenial and attentive. The triage tech was so-so, and the doctor (I saw Dr. Miranda today) was incredibly helpful, sympathetic, knowledgeable, and kind. I went in for severe hand pain and was given a wrist brace as well as an increase in my Neurontin. The only drawbacks were that the scale needed to be calibrated and there was an  extremely long wait in the exam room. I was shuffled quickly from the waiting room to triage, to the exam room, but I was left waiting there for at least half an hour. Thankfully, I brought a book with me.   I was amazed to find this kind of clinic with friendly, non-jaded personnel in this neighborhood. It was the polar opposite of my experience at Nextcare (see my review). Hopefully I won't need to drop in again, but if I do have to choose an urgent care, it will be this one.

I called on a Wednesday and was able to come in on Saturday. The certification process was easy. The doctor who did my intake was knowledgeable and professional. I didn't have my medical records; only my MRI disc, so I signed a release form for my records and I was easily approved. The staff was very laid back but extremely friendly and helpful. My card arrived about three weeks later. Will recommend to all my friends with chronic pain and other issues qualifying for an mmj card.

Holy shawarma, Batman! This place rocks. Nestled between a Chinese joint and Dollar Tree, I was frozen when I saw the photo in the window. Chicken shawarma is my favorite meal of all time. The place never seems to be too terribly busy. It's family run, and the younger men are pretty friendly. However, I brought my friend, who is a butch, and the older folks--the parents--refused to look at her, and only addressed me. Bummer.   The food is tasty, from shawarma to gyros to house salad to basmati rice and tabouli. I'll just stick to take out or delivery from now on.

I transferred from the Arcadia clinic to Peoria after having a discogram done by Dr. Abram Burgher. There was nothing particularly wrong with the Arcadia clinic; I just felt like there was no real urgency to the importance of my case. I was really wowed by how attentive and kind Burgher and his staff were. This has remained true as I have been seeing his PA, Annette Tuszynski. I am given as much time as needed for every appointment, and have been treated with the utmost of concern and respect during each visit. I would heartily recommend this site to anyone needing pain management.
