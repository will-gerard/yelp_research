This is not the place to go for dinner.  Period.  They have limited evening hours and it's for a good reason.  During the 30 minutes I was there, not a single other soul ventured in.  I think they save the lunch leftovers and schlep them onto the unsuspecting evening customer. I can put up with a lot of things for a cheap dinner.  I don't need good customer service.  I don't need to eat in a safe neighborhood.  I'm not expecting gourmet, either.   But, damn it, when you turn the lights off during business hours while I'm in the middle of chomping down my stale pizza, I'm drawing the line.   Sure, come for lunch.  I'm always a fan of pizza by the slice places, and if my pizza was fresh, I'm sure it would have been good.  Pretty sure, anyways.

Maybe I should have got the chicken fried steak.  Because that steak I had was something else.  There was so much grease piled on top of my t-bone that I'm pretty sure I'm a likely candidate for the world's youngest triple bypass patient.  I'll admit, sometimes grease makes for good grubbin'.  But not this time.  I went on a Saturday night and there was a little bit of a wait. But our server was plenty kind.  She completely forgot our order of fried okra, but I wasn't feeling too upset about it.

I've always noticed the Capital Grille when I went to Biltmore, but thanks to last month's yelp event I finally got a chance to try out some menu items and I've been back twice this month.   It's the kind of place that you want reservations for, but we made a spur of the moment decision on a Friday night and got lucky enough to find a spot to at the bar. The wine menu is extensive, as you would expect it to be for the prices/quality of food. The steak portions are large and the Kona crusted sirloin we ordered was plenty for two (the kitchen split it for us). It was perfectly medium rare. The bread basket and sides were both good, but not the main reason you'd want to come.  Yesterday we went back to try the lunch plates menu and sat in the restaurant area. The service here was spot-on and we were in and out in an hour. Both the burger and mini tenderloin were great choices.  The ricotta cheesecake was a delicious, albeit overfilling, finishing touch.  There's a slight men's-club feeling to the place and I wouldn't describe it as trendy, but I'd have no problems going back for a solid steak.

If you only have an hour to spare and want to burn some serious calories, you should check out a spin class. Just come prepared knowing this isn't your average gym environment and those sweatpants don't exactly fit in with the trendy Arcadia vibe.  Things you should know before your first visit: 1. Bring water and a towel 2. Come early to get a spot 3. The only type of shoes you can wear at this studio are the spinning/clip-in kind. They have plenty for you to borrow, but research your shoe size online first. It takes practice clipping in, but it's doable. 4. Be ready to stand on your bike for the entire time.  5. It's a dark ride, so nobody's going to be looking at you. Don't be afraid you'll be judged as a newbie. 6. It is fun and you'll be glad you came.

After busting out every tool I could find from the toolbox and trying for 30 minutes to remove a watch link, I gave up.  Luckily, the watch guy was able to remove it in under a minute for $5. He also replaces batteries for the same.  He's cash only and not open on weekends.

Consider this a real salon.  A place that you would wear makeup and decent clothes to.  I showed up in my most unflattering work outfit and I was feeling a little more than uncomfortable.     Thankfully, my stylist Mandy didn't prejudge me and was willing to take her time discussing my new cut and highlights.  She had lots of good ideas and I ended up with really good cut and some new blonde highlights.  I'd definitely go back to her.

So I wouldn't go there on a romantic date, but you will find me there for lunch a couple of times a month.   The chips and salsa are good, but what I really go there for is their Fry Bread.  I've eaten at the competition and it's good, but El Bravo does a fantastic job of satisfying my need for overindulgence.  I get the Navajo Taco, and there is enough meat, beans, cheese and veggies to make two meals.  You've gotta try it :) I've never had to wait for a table and the food always comes fast enough to make it back to the office before my lunch break is over.

I can't believe everyone is talking about driving up to the summit. Get up off your lazy ass and hike it!!  It is possible to get up there using your own to two feet...well, maybe not during the summer...but it's totally worth it. I'm taking off a star because I think the trail is difficult to follow towards the top and I've gotten lost several times.  And getting lost in the mountains with no cell phone coverage gives me a panic attack.   They also have silent sundays where they close off the road to the summit to vehicle traffic.  Bicylists love it.  I tried to walk it once, but I got more mean comments from cyclists in a few hours than I had in the entire previous year.  Apparently, I didn't know I was supposed to walk the shoulder of the road.  So from now on, I'll stick to hiking the mountain trail and enjoy beautiful mother nature..

Superstar is like a blast from the past...it reminds me of what video stores used to be in the 90's.   The place is run by a gaggle of hipsters who have always been helpful. The video selection is pretty decent and they do daily rentals for just a little more than redbox ($1.79). They have a lots of TV series and a okay selection of gay movies.  And, if your interested, the back room has plenty of porn to rent.

Some people would be scared off by the Christown location. However, I'm not one to discriminate and have been known to peruse Desert Sky Mall. Alone.  So, I choose Famous Footwear for my newest pair of gym shoes because they have all of their available shoes/sizes on the floor. I don't have to wait for anyone else to inefficiently help me. Some call me controlling. I prefer empowered.  I was on my hands and knees, trying to find any shoes that came in my size. Unfortunately, they don't seem to keep a decent stock and it's like trying to find a needle in a haystack. I ended up walking out empty handed.  I ended up checking their website the next day and they have a shoe locator that can save you some time. It sent me to the Camelback location where I got what I wanted.

I love bargain hunting here. Their selection rotates seasonally but I've found some great deals on all kinds of women's clothing, boots, swimwear, and pajamas.  There's a huge section with dresses and their lingerie tends to go up to sizes big girls will be happy about. Sadly, it's a bit of a crapshoot to know which departments are having an extra percentage off the sale prices on any given day. No returns allowed.

My family has been spending B-day's at NNY for years, and I wish I could tell you why.  Maybe we're just creatures of habit, because I have been consistently disappointed with their food.  I'm a wing girl, and last nights dry, crusty wings did nothing for me.  The pizza was mediocre...I would have done better to stuff a frozen pizza in my purse and take bites when the waitress wasn't looking.  And I know the economy is bad, but they were doing some real nickel and dimeing.  5 of us ordered 50 wings, and it only came with 4 small cups of ranch.  So, it was a fight to decide who had to share.  Then someone had the brilliant idea to just ask for another cup of ranch.  The waitress warmly replied "there is an extra charge for that".  Oh well,  I guess it's my fault if I keep going back.

This is where you can take all of your out-of-town visitors who come to Arizona to see the Wild West and are disappointed when all they see is urban sprawl. The drive in from the Apache Trail is beautiful with vistas of the Superstition Mountains, winding roads, and desert landscapes.  The Dolly Steamboat operates year-round, but makes seasonal adjustments to it's daily schedule. During the winter season, they have two daytime rides per day, and I took the 2pm. The boat was completely full and I'd advise to make reservations in advance, just to make sure you get a seat.  From beginning to end, the musical soundtrack is completly cliche. It started with "Hello Dolly" and ended with "I saw God today." And yes, the Titanic theme song was played more than once. But I won't begrudge them because the ride was fabulous.  Highlights were rock formations, petrified wood in the rocks, and a group of longhorn sheep.   This is a very family-oriented tour and there were lots of kids and seniors aboard and everyone seemed to be having a great time.

My doctor's office uses Avella to fill their specialty scripts so I didn't have much choice when picking this facility. Sadly, I had multiple poor experiences and would be hesitant to use them again. Their phone system is difficult to get through and even once you finally get a real person it doesn't always get better. On more than one occasion, the answer to my question was "I don't know." No offer to check, just "I don't know."  The location is far for me, so after the first time of driving out there and being told they don't have my medications ready yet, I opted to pay extra for the mail delivery.  However, on one of the shipments, they accidently delivered to the wrong address and failed to notify me. I know they recently switched from Apothecary to Avella so I'm hoping they get some of their kinks worked out. Fast.

There's not much more I can say about Taliesin West that hasn't already been said before.  I'm a person who doesn't know the difference between an architect and draftsman and didn't know anything about FLW until I visited.  But even I was fascinated with story and details in the guided tour.  I went on the Panorama tour that lasted a little over an hour and visited the music room, the front lawn, movie room, reception area, and meeting room.   So, what makes this a 5 star review???   THE WHOLE TOUR WAS FREE!!   With the new culture pass for the library, you can check this gem out gratis!!  And seeing that several reviewers mentioned the high cost of the tour ($27), it seems as if there is no better time to check it out!

A+++ for the patio that you can sit on during the hot ass summers.   The food was pretty good (I had a burger with fries) but I don't recommend the ice cream cake for dessert.  Next time, I'll skip the cake and order another beer.   Had the Kilt Lifter and it was great.  The Heffenweizen seems pretty popular also because lots of people around me were ordering it. Happy Hour pints are $3 and pitchers are $11.

Two blistered hands, one bruised knee, and a killer sunburn are souvenirs from my inaugural hike up the echo canyon trail. It's more like rock climbing than hiking and it's a great workout because it requires both cardio and strength skills.  It's not a hike for those who are wanting solitude, but that's okay for me because I usually go alone and I would be thankful for the witnesses had I taken a nosedive off the side of the mountain.  Parking was awful on a Wednesday morning and I had to park 1/2 a mile down the street in a residential neighborhood.  The view from the top is amazing and well worth the effort.  Five Stars.

The patio at Cibo is so perfect that I haven't wanted to try eating inside.  I thought the interior couldn't possibly measure up to the allure of the patio.  Well, I was wrong.  The inside may be a little noisier, but it's still charming and a great place to grab a bite.     Cibo is a one-stop restaurant that not only has great pizza, but also fantastic salads and desserts.   And cheap wine.  I'm partial to the margherita pizza with the fresh basil followed by a nutella and strawberry crepe.  That way, I can say I've had at least one serving of fruits and vegetables for the day.   Add a glass of wine for heart health and it's a healthy and delicious meal!

I'm no expert, but I'm pretty sure you will need that 99¢ pregnancy test to go along with your 99¢ condoms.    I think the 99¢ Only Store is one of the best values in town.  Unlike other dollar stores, this chain has fresh produce and refrigerated foods.  And enough cheap junk food to get you ready for your next sumo match.  They have potted plants, dishes, animal treats, car accessories and cleaning supplies.  They have everything.    Not everything is a super deal.  During my last visit, I've noticed that some of the national brands are downsizing their products and you can get a better value at the grocery store.  But I usually walk away happy knowing I've saved a couple bucks.

I don't care how much it costs. I'll never see another movie in anything other than their cinema suites again. Ever.  I love their leather recliners! They are just as comfortable as the one at your grandparents house. Plus, you get beer delivered to you at the touch of a button and prices are surprisingly reasonable (4 for a pint of domestic, 5 for imports). Plus, you get a sample of specialty popcorn, a warm towel, and a Ghirardelli chocolate on your way out.   It can get crowded in the evenings, so you might want to consider purchasing your tickets ahead of time.  Don't go expecting AMC to serve you a gourmet meal unless you think Applebee's is a real treat.

Judging from my dog's excessive leash pulling and tail wagging while we are walking to the lake, I'd say she loves this place! It's a great place to take a dog to exercise during the summer because they can cool off in the lake portion anytime.  I've gotten a major sunburn waiting for her to be ready to go home. The only problem I have is that my dog figured out how to jump around the barrier gate that divides the lake/play space from the open area.  Imagine my surprise when I found my dog running towards another family trying welcome the new dogs to her favorite playground. It can be a little dirty, but dogs are dirty.  It's still worth the trip!

This is by far the least crowded theater in the valley.  I just saw a movie during it's opening weekend, and the theatre was almost empty.  I've actually spent Christmas morning here, two years running.  Still not busy.    Who can complain about 4 hours of validated, covered parking, either?

Joe's is:  * dog and kid friendly * super cute with a great outdoor area  * good, fresh food for you.  Their chicken is antibiotic and hormone free and they grow many of their own veggies * busy, but not crowded I've eaten at both Joe's locations, and I prefer this one.

After indulging in my three course meal last night for Yelp Eats, I'm reminded again to do my penance at the gym. I've been a member for about 6 months, and it's all been great.  The equipment is clean and new.  They have a decent selection of TV shows that I can watch to try and distract myself from the sweat dripping into my eyes.  They have one group fitness room and a good selection of classes.  They post the group schedule online so you can plan accordingly.   There are people of all shapes, sizes and fitness levels.   Also, if you buy your membership from Costco, it's a pretty unbeatable deal.

I know very little about the Beatles and was apprehensive about spending a lot of money on tickets. But at the end of the show, I couldn't have been happier. And more importantly, I was feeling a little cheated that the only music group that I had to grow up with was New Kids on the Block  The dancing and acrobatics were amazing. It's a great theatre setup, and the higher seats are still fantastic for viewing all the stage. It was a multi-sensory experience. During Here Comes the Sun, I could smell the incense and was ready to practice my best meditations.  The show is about 90 minutes and has no intermission so plan your eating, drinking and pottying accordingly.

I've had burgers that cost twice as much with half the taste.  That's what my dad said about his Mushroom Burger.   This must be one of the best values in town and it actually tastes good.  Well, my hamburger has been a little overdone more than once.  But I think that charred flavor just makes it seem like I'm at a family cookout.  The seasoning on the fries is great and I had to stop myself from shoveling them in my mouth.   If you want to eat there, find the picnic tables at the back.  Sure, it's like eating in a parking lot, but you are guaranteed to have hot fries.   CASH ONLY.  They do have an ATM inside.

I can now say I've been to Il Posto for lunch, dinner, and happy hour.  I love their patio so much that I wouldn't even consider eating inside, even if it was 100 degrees outside.   I'm surprised more hasn't been mentioned about their delish homemade potato chips.  I've been known to skip the salad so that I could fill up on more chips. I'm usually like meat, but went with the margherita pizza last night and I can say I'm impressed.  The bread and pesto sauce were also excellent. With great atmosphere and good food, I'll definitely go back.

It's impossible to go wrong on Mondays.  $3 burger and fries?  It's true.  Super props to the Bistro Burger for it's use of ciabatta bread, angus beef, and perfectly delectable fries.  If you come between 3-6 on Monday, you can also take advantage of the Happy Hour menu.  Of course my favorite is the $5 Wingless Dip that is served with pita bread and tortilla chips.  Add a $3 glass of red sangria and I'm set.   Now's a great time to sit and enjoy the outdoor patio on the cheap!

My dad and I make it to Texas Roadhouse at least once a month just to eat their fresh rolls with cinnamon butter.  Everyone is on a budget these days and the food is a super bargain!  I've had the ribs, steak, and prime rib and they have all tasted great.  I know it's a chain restaurant and all, but the food and prices make it worthy of a visit.

Yay for Sourdough!  This is East Mesa folks, not exactly a culinary destination.  But this is good pizza!  It's local and been around forever, so it's not exactly trendy.  Please don't take your first date here unless you are an octogenarian on a day pass from the assisted living facility. No thin crust to be found on this menu.  But pile whatever toppings you can fit on the pizza and enjoy a hearty slice.  They have a decent drink selection, and lots of other italian items on the menu that I've never tried because the pizza is so good.  It's a popular destination for the winter snowbirds, if you go a little later in the evenings, you can avoid the rush.  But three generations of my family have loved this place and the next time you are crusin' Apache Junction, you should check it out!

The french toast was fun!  It was a baquette bread dipped in vanilla custard.  I just read a review that mentioned dipping it into the syrup and I'm going to try that next time.   I also had a bite of the chocolate chip cookie that was soft and had a good flavor to it.    The menu was also helpful in identifying foods that travel well, in case you want to take your order to go.

So, apparantly it's true.  Blonde's do have more fun.  And to think without Davanzo's, and Myra in particular, I would have never discovered this!    Living on the West Side, it's hard to find a decent place to get your hair done.  Who would have thought Tolleson would even have a salon??  But it doesn't come recommended without a few caveats.  If you are offended by religious propaganda, this might not be the place for you.  There is a Bible perched next to the latest issue of Hairstyle's Today and a cross in the bathroom.  Issues ot Christian Living (or something of that nature) are also available for the taking.    Truthfully, I've always wanted to wander in one day with a Pride Flag around my shoulders, just to see if they would kick me out.  But I'm not going to risk rocking the boat because Myra does a kick ass job on my hair.  And she's very sweet, too.  I think the price is affordable, for about $100 bucks, I can get my hair highlighted, cut and styled.  And she even helps me tease my hair to cover my cowlick...that's the best service I've ever gotten at a salon!!

I've had lunch and dinner at this family owned restaurant and I'm always leaving happy and full.  And it's clean inside, too. The servers are always friendly and have wanted to give recommendations about other dishes to try.  Last night, she told me that fried foods were not actually fattening, so I took that as a cue to devour both my egg roll and deep fried shrimp! It's always made to order so everything comes out hot and fresh.  Aside from the deep fried appetizers, I think this place can actually be a healthy place to eat, too. The dinner entrees with chicken were about $7, beef $8, seafood $9.  Lunch specials were around $5.

In an effort to be nice, let me just say this.  If you are going to try this place for the first time, try not to get your order to-go. This way you can make adjustments and hopefully get your food to have some flavor. I guess I should have known something was amiss when the order was called in and nobody asked how spicy to prepare the dishes.  The pad thai was mushy and bland.  The thai style chow mein had more firmness in the noodles, but still required extra soy sauce.  I will give some credit to the egg rolls that were pretty decent and not overly deep friend.

Damn my neglectful parents who never bothered give me frozen custard as a child! I have let 28 long years pass. I can't ever get those years back, but I can take control of my own destiny and make sure it becomes a permanent fixture in my life.  Culver's has two staples. Chocolate and Vanilla. Boring? Not any more. Not when it's creamy, smooth, and rich. They have Marshmallow fluff as a topping! They also have a "flavor of the day" that you can check out on their website.   I had great customer service, too!

After months of anticipation, Ross has finally arrived in the Slopes!    All hail the $2 underwear, $5 sunglasses, and $10 dresses.    It's in a converted office supply store, so it has a little bit of an industrial feel to it.  But the racks are full, the merchandise is organized (as much as it can be), and they have a petite section.

16 Flavors.  30 cents per ounce. Tons of toppings, both candy and fresh fruit (I don't know why anyone would want to ruin their dessert by putting fruit on it, but whatever).  It's next to the Harkins Theatre.  Better than Mojo.

I'm a yogurtology maven.  I've already filled up two loyalty cards and am digging their new automated card program.  With how frequently I was going, it makes good sense to switch to a more environmentally friendly system.   Yogurtology is head and shoulders above the nearby mojo.  It has easier parking, more froyo, more toppings, and friendly staff.  The flavors change often (my fave has been the elusive butterfinger) but you can always count on some classics like oatmeal cookie and cake batter.  And, I kid you not, one of the toppings is frosting in a can!!  Unbelievable.

Well.   The front of the house couldn't be better. Fabulous appearance, extremely attentive service, courteous server. High end glassware and place settings.  The server's presentation of the food builds your expectations...  But.  The food shatters the image.  We ordered a main dish, the goat cheese tortellini as an appetizer to share.  Good thing we didn't expect to fill up on this sad serving of 3 limp, lifeless blobs.  It was evident that the pasta was fresh but the flavor and texture were lacking.  And, I am being gentle. From there, we were scared to adventure in to other creative dishes so we stayed "safe" with the burger and fries.  Ordered medium, the hockey puck came out well-done with soggy fries to match.  Aye. My wife made me send it back threatening a better meal at the Burger King.  We rarely complain but we asked the server for a new burger, he obliged, graciously.  He served us some complementary bread items which were nice and fresh.  The new burger and fries arrived shortly and were upgraded from an F to a C+, at best.  We were happy with the option for small or large pours of wine.  I really want Province to pull it together because it has great potential.  On a previous occasion, I enjoyed a burger, fries and margarita over happy hour in the bar.  I will be back because I remain hopeful for you, Province.

According to me (and really, who else matters) Zoyo is top dog in the froyo world. I like how their yogurt has all the classics but also kicks it up a notch with seasonal flavors. Toppings are plentiful and finely chopped so I can fit all 8 different candy bar flavors in my cup. If you wear your jammies on Wednesday nights, you'll get 50% off.
