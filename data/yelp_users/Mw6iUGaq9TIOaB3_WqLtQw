This is a small restaurant, but the food there serve is actually very good, far better than what i thought i would get.  The plus side is that it's an actual Restuarant not one is the chain things they have in abundance or here. And what that means is that the food is all made to order and nor just heated up.  The prices are fair and service is always fast, while the service is not exactly memorable or is still friendly, and overall pretty good. It's not too far from home so for me that's a plus. There's only a small handful of restaurants that are close to me, and this is one of maybe three thati go to on a regular basis.   The rest are not really worth mentioning much less actually go to.  It is with checking out though

This apple bees is pretty awesome. Everytime I come here I seem to get the same waitress.  Destiny is and princess incredible service. The food here is decent, and comes out hot and delicious.   for some strange reason service is faster here when it gets busy,  but over all the still provide good food and service.

The food here is surprisingly better than i thought it would be, considering i rarely ever eat cheap food much less cheap all you can eat Chinese food. But do far the food is edible, i don't think I'm gonna get food poisoning, and it was after all cheap $7.40 for dinner with all your can eat and soda.  I'm dropping stars because it seems impossible to get a refill on soda. So far it's been fifteen minutes and I thirsty as heck.  Is normally leave a tip, but I'm not happy with their service here

This is by far one of my favorite places to eat. The food is incredibly.  Drinks are good, and fairly priced. Happy hour weekdays till 6p.m.   I go here at least once a week, sometimes two or three times a week. And I plan to keep coming

Peter piper is pretty awesome.  it's great for kids, great for families, it's just great for everyone.  What more is there to like,  it's pizza, games, and fun for all ages.  i know that i would recommend this pizza place any day.

I used to like this jack in the box,  but not any more. They just charged me nine bucks for a number ten. The menu displays just under seven bucks, but what what ever. I don't even like fast food.  I don't like it even more when i get two dollars in tax for something under ten bucks. I guess it's about convenience

This place is pretty awesome for lunch. We ordered a pizza, and a few beers. The have over 20+ on tap.  The press was much better than i thought the beer was great, the service is commendable, the actual restaurant/bar is clean and well maintained as well as the dining area. It shows was pleasant, polite, suggested a really good bet, and want over bearing. Overall i plan to come back here again, and would recommend this place any day.

This place is crappy. I spent almost an hour getting here.  I left my wallet in the truck (so i don't spend too much money)  after I find a machine and sit down (about fifteen twenty minutes) the security came up and asked to see my ID,and since i left it in the truck I didn't have it.    Instead of just letting me go get it I was told to leave,   and then while waiting for my friends they wouldn't stop harassing me. They said to wait for my friends in valet, so i did, and a few minutes later. They came out to the valet, and continued to harass me. I ended up calling my friends and telling them I'd be at the gas station actors the street We came here just to have some fun,and celebrate my birthday which do far has not really been fun, and little aggravating

Thus was my first time eating here. and i have to say that it has genuinely been a fantastic experience.  the food was incredible.  which is exactly what i expected.  the service was far better than outstanding.   it is the service which makes a restaurant stand out.  and i have to say that for this establishment Gilbert when above and beyond my expectations, which i have to admit is not an easy thing to do.   with the combination of great food,incredible service,and a clean easy going atmosphere i will most definitively be back

I thought this hotel was horribly over priced. The locations bad,  they said they renovated the ruins, but there nothing new or impressive about them. Overall I think I would have had a better stay staying at a motel6. The sheets smelled slightly so I slept on top of them. The shower didn't drain, so I felt dirty afterwards. They had very limited cable. The tv was fuzzy. You could hear all the traffic that pulled in our drive down the street. There was no wifi. Over all. I think this was I've of the wheat hotel stays I have had in a very very long time.

I love coming here.  They have more than a little bit of everything. Sometimes I walk down isles a few times and find brew stuff every time.  The have great deals. And some pretty unique things that I hope to buy before someone else does. I'll be in here sometime this week

This was an awesome breakfast experience. The dining room was very clean which I always like that see.  We were seated without a long wait.  And for that brief moment the hostess was very polite, conversational, and happy. Our waitress Lynn was by far one of the best I've had in quite a long time. She is the prime example of what superior Customer service should be like.  And because of the outstanding service we received here I can't wait to come back and eat here again.

Some friends of mine and i had used A to Z moving a while back.  And it was a probably one of the worst moves i had ever seen.  To start off one of the guys was in the restroom for most of the move, god only knows what he was doing in there.   To me it seemed like the movers were just there to get the job done and didn't care about our belongings or the building we were moving out of.  I'm not sure how many scuffs and scratches we had to repair. And thats not even mentioning all the furniture they scratched, dented, and broke. So as far as A To Z moving is concerned do yourself a favor and use another moving company.  In the long run it'll save you alot of stress money and time.  I should have checked the not recommended section before we used them.  Thats where all the bad reviews are.

It's been a while since I last have a review, and I think a pizza place such as this is worthy of review.  It's open till midnight, has great prices, and even sells pizza by the slice.  The dining area was clean, which is always an encouraging sign.  The service was fantastic.  It takes more than just a pretty face to get me to keep coming back, and her customer service skills were impressive to say the least.  I do believe that I might have found a pizza place that I can keep cooking back to again and again
