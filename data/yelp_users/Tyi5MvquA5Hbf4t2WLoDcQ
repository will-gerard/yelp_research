I pretty much have to give five stars to the place that saved my life...  Awesome staff, from the nursing assistants to the administrative folks to the nurses and the doctors.   Without fail, everyone we came in contact with from the moment I was rushed into the ER with a heart attack until I checked out four days later after having two angioplasties and two stents inserted into my aching heat was fabulous.  Thank you all for the terrific care!  My only gripe would be the gowns that showed my ass as I strolled the halls during the recovery, and the kitchens uncanny ability to remove all flavor from the food. How do they manage to make green beans taste like meat that tastes like oatmeal that tastes like cardboard? But hey, that's hospitals and it's not like they are going to serve up a greasy double bacon cheeseburger to a guy that just had a massive heart attack.

Since discovering Liberty Market a couple of months ago, I'm pretty sure I've made a mortgage payment for Joe Johnston, the ever-present owner.  Breakfasts are great. I'm partial to the Western Scramble, but everything I've had has been very good, with large portions and served by attentive staff. They have some coffee drink, I can't ever remember the name, that comes in a shot glass and you have to stir it up. Delightful. Get two.  Lunches and dinners are also very good. The "bowl of meat" and the hamburgers are outstanding.  I've attended Liberty Market with just me and the bride, a small gathering of friends, as wall as with large groups and I've never been disappointed.

Yeah, I know, it's a Wendy's. What should I expect?  How about at least getting *something* right on my order? You know, *anything*.  I order a grilled chicken sandwich, large fries, and a large chocolate frosty. The person at the counter says, "$2.13".   Hey, I'm all for a great discount, but given that the frosty pushes two bucks alone, something was amiss.  No translator was available, but we managed to figure out she'd charged me for the 99 cent "crispy chicken" sandwich, no fries and a small frosty.  So she re-rang it, correctly I assumed.  I get my bag o' food, and she plops down not a frosty, but a soft drink. Whatever, I'm kinda in a hurry, so I just grabbed it and left. This is after all, "fast food", I was freaking starving and just wanted to get out.  In the car I find I got not a chicken sandwich, but a hamburger. And not large fries, but a small order.  The burger was, Wendy's. The fries, Wendy's. The soda, diet (which I think tastes like feet).  I've eaten a LOT of fast food in my time, but I don't recall ever having EVERYTHING wrong.

This review is for the Auto Body World at 5620 E Baseline Rd. Mesa, AZ 85206.  No one ever WANTS to have to go to an auto body shop (Do they? I certainly hope not...)  Thanks to some knucklehead executing an illegal left turn into my driver's side door, I didn't have a whole lot of choice other than to find a body shop.  My insurance company directed me to Auto Body World. So off I went.  I was impressed upon pulling into the parking lot. The place was clean, and staffed by friendly, helpful and downright cordial people. They made a stressful, generally painful experience as good as it could be.  There is an Enterprise Rental Car outlet right in the shop and I was in and out in 15 minutes.  Several days later (and 4 days earlier than promised!) I got a call that the car would be ready that afternoon.  The bodywork was flawless. Paint was matched perfectly, window retint was an exact match. Everything looked great.  Except one minor piece of damaged trim was not replaced. As soon as I pointed this out, the manager agreed that it should have been replaced and I had an appointment to bring the car back in. That's a bit of a drag and keeps Auto Body World from getting a coveted fifth star. But at least there was no hassle what-so-ever getting the additional work done. And they genuinely felt bad about missing this.  But other than that one minor thing, they did very high quality work, in a clean, friendly and professional atmosphere.  Needing a body shop sucks. But if you have to use one, I don't think you'll go wrong with Auto Body World.

This isn't a review for the stadium as a baseball stadium.  Huh?  Yep, it's a review of Scottsdale Stadium as a venue for a NON-baseball event.  We recently leased part of the stadium for a one day "Real Estate Bar Camp". We leased the Team Shop, Press Box and some conference rooms (and the stands at the last minute).  Over 300 attended this all day event.  And we got raves about the venue. It's unusual, but very cool, to hold a conference/meeting in a baseball stadium.   Rates are VERY reasonable, and the staff at Scottsdale Stadium is *first class*. They set up the rooms to our exact request, and were around all day to ensure there was nothing we needed.    The only think lacking is wifi internet service, but rumor has it Qwest can come in and set something up.   If you or your organization is looking for a unique venue to host a conference, meeting, whatever, consider Scottsdale Stadium. You, and your attendees, will not be disappointed!

The one (and only) thing I miss about living in Albuquerque, New Mexico is the food. "New Mexico Mexican" is different, and not easily found outside the confines of that state.  Carlsbad Tavern gets it though. They offer truly authentic New Mexican cuisine. Some will love it, some won't.   On top of good food, the atmosphere is cool too. Even on a freezing cold night (freezing from the Phoenix perspective), you can sit comfortably on the wicked cool patio thanks to fireplaces and heaters.   Service has been above average on every trip I've taken.

At 48 years of age, I was a tattoo virgin. Not only did I have no tattoos, I'd never even stepped foot into a tattoo parlor.  It's a long story (that does NOT involve a "mid life crisis"), but I decided I wanted to get a tattoo on my upper arm in permanent homage to the Great State of Texas.  And where the hell was I going to find a place to do this in Arizona?  Enter No Regrets Tattoo Parlor.  I went to a few places, talked to a few artists and people in the stores. Something, and I can't even say exactly what, just sort of put me off. Honestly, they just kinda creeped me out.  Then I walked into No Regrets. The music was blaring, people were laughing and the "receptionist" (or whatever her job title is) was just cool. I liked the place.  Alex was just finishing up someone and in a couple of minutes he approached me. I told him I wanted something in the shape of Texas. We chatted about it, he said, "what about this and that?" and we kind of worked out the idea. And off he he went to the back of the shop.  10 maybe 15 minutes later, he came out with a amazing design and I knew immediately that was "it".  So I laid my butt in the chair and he went to work. *Super* nice guy, told me everything that would happen and gently broke my tattoo cherry.  I *love* the work. Sometimes it still freaks me out that its there, but that's not Alex's fault. The place was clean, the people cool, and the artists are amazing.

I just read Genevieve R's review below and have to say I didn't even know Fatburger had a vegetarian burger.  Who the hell goes to a place named "Fatburger" and eats veggies?  ;)  Me, I do the double meat (real meat, you know, beef), double cheese Fatburger. It's double the goodness. You can practically feel your arteries hardening with every drippy gooey delicious bite.  I don't know what it is about this place. But sometimes I just get this weird, "I need a Fatburger NOW" craving. And it doesn't stop until I gorge myself. Then I'm good for a couple of months.  It is a bit on the pricey side, but so far every visit has resulted in a tasty, juicy burger. Fries have ranged between so -so to really good. I have no idea why, but sometimes they just seem.... limp.  Killer shakes too!

Tucked away in Agritopia, The Coffee Shop can be hard to find.   Maybe that's a good thing.  I found The Coffee Shop because I like the restaurant next door -  Joe's Farm Grill. And when I found out it had free wifi, it quickly became my office away from home (of note, as appears to be typical everywhere else, there can be a shortage of electrical outlets at peak hours. Just club someone over the head and take theirs. A more sophisticated approach may be to hand them a five, tell them to go buy one of the DELIGHTFUL pastries and take their plug while they are at the counter).  The coffee is great, the pastries are to die for and the patio / garden area makes you say, "Toto, we're not at Starbucks anymore".

I go to Whole Foods precisely once a month, on the final Friday.   It's a freaking party in a grocery store!  #EVFN (East Valley Friday Nights) happens in the Wine & Tappas bar. Starts at 6:00pm on the last Friday of the mont until they boot the last straggler out.  I'll freely admit it, I don't know what the hell a Tappas is. But I know what beer is, and Whole Foods has a veritable "Wall O' Beer" to choose from.  The staff is great, the food is good, the eclectic mix of EVFN'ers is awesome. That Whole Foods not just tolerates us but *welcome* us is very cool.  A party in a grocery store. Whodathunkit?

I can sum up this review with this:  An alcohol-free lunch for two at a Mexican restaurant that costs $45 better have me saying, "Holy crap that was good, I can't wait to go back!"  Not so at Cantina Laredo.  They tout "gourmet Mexican food".  And while some of the entree's looked interesting, and I suppose "gourmetish", I was basically unimpressed.  The table-side prepared guacamole was very good, though $10 seems a bit pricey. It was nice and chunky, just how I like it (though the onions were TOO chunky for my taste. Unlike a previous reviewer noted, the jalapenos were diced to the perfect size).  Chips were excellent, and the salsas were quite tasty, but had absolutely no fire.  I ordered the Enchiladas de Mole, which were just OK. Not bad, not great. The "Sweet, spicy blend of dried Mexican peppers" made me think there would be some spice/fire to this dish, but again there was none. Flavorful, yes. Spicy, not-so-much. And there was something odd about the taste that we couldn't quite place. One of those dishes that I couldn't quite decide if I liked or not. It was almost as if the cook did something for the sole purpose of making it "gourmet".  My lovely bride ordered a combo plate that was anything but "gourmet". It was standard Mexican fare. Again, OK but not great by any stretch of the imagination (and available for half the price at any mom & pop type place on the planet).  The guy behind me ordered fajitas that smelled delightful. Then again, you can throw a hunk of any form of beef on a sizzling skillet and it'll smell delightful to me.   Service was very good. We were seated swiftly (the place was basically empty at noon, which doesn't bode well for their future) and the food came quickly. Our soda / tea / chips were never empty. Very attentive service, though not particularly friendly. Clearly not rude, just sort of "there".  This place looks like it might be fun to hang out and have drinks. A large (and apparently well stocked) bar is front and center. With margaritas pushing $12 a pop though, be sure to check your credit limit before leaving home.  In short, you can slap "gourmet" on the facade and on the menu. You can charge "gourmet" prices. But if you don't serve gourmet food, you wind up with a two star restaurant that I can't recommend....

I am not a tea drinker. I don't like tea in any shape, form or fashion. I am also not some trendy hip "urbanite". I'm pretty much a beer drinking, meat eating, fun loving kinda guy.  But I *like* Urban Tea Loft!  I was there for the "East Valley Friday Nights" meetup a couple of previous reviewers mentioned. I do think we overwhelmed them a little bit as the service was a little slow (though the servers, bartenders and owners were all delightful people).  I had the catfish off the weekend "soul food" menu, and unlike Ben's experience, mine was close to perfect. The fish was firm, NOT fishy at all, and very tasty. I had mac-and-cheese and fried okra for sides and both were very well done. M&C was creamy, cheesy and the pasta was cooked  "al dente"  -- as it should be. The fried okra was great, and completely lacking in that snot-like look and feel that poorly prepared okra can have (sorry for the graphical reference...)  The place is cool. Kinda hip, but not "over-the-top I wanna be in Scottsdale" hip. There was a great jazz guitar player at perfect volume (not too loud, not too soft) -- I doubt this happens every day, it was a Friday night after all. Two very cool private rooms are in the back, one set up with leather padded walls (a horrific description, you'll just have to see it) and the other is a sort of "media room" complete with flat screen, wifi, and a mini-bar type fridge. Either would be *perfect* for small meetings.  The owners were really, really neat people and you can tell they are working hard to make Urban Tea Loft a great place.  I'll be back, if for no other reason than to see if the bartender really makes a "kick ass margarita" like she claims (she definitely made a kick-ass Washington Apple).  And seriously, get there this month and see the photography they have on display from local artist Chanelle Richardson. *Very* nice work! http://www.crphotography.org/

Here's the deal....  I go to restaurants for two things -- food, and service.  The food at Blue Adobe Grill would get five stars. It was that good. As a former resident of Albuquerque (see, I even know how to spell it) I know what authentic New Mexico style food looks and tastes like, and this is the real deal. I had the Carne Adovado stacked enchiladas and they were delightful.  Sadly, horrific service can destroy a dining experience and the service here easily qualified as horrific. I was with the (prearranged) large group mentioned in a couple of other reviews. Once I was finally able to locate my own menu, and once the server reluctantly (and rudely) agreed to take our order, the food came relatively swiftly. I was disappointed that the fried egg I ordered was left off, but the server said he'd be right back with it.   I never saw him again.   The closest I came to getting the egg was on my check, where the cost was added in. Rather than wait for what would probably be another half an hour to get the check corrected, I just chalked it up as a loss and moved on.   If you want good food and lousy service, come here. If you want both good New Mexico style food AND good service, try Los Dos Molinos in Mesa (very close by) or Carlsbad Taverns in Scottsdale.

I think people generally go to a pizzeria and bar type place for three basic things:  1) Food 2) Drinks 3) Service  Since I could get neither food nor drink, I can only speak to service.  And I think I just did.  I am not exaggerating here. I was in La Bocco for an hour before a server approached. While the pizza looked fabulous, I'd heard people talking about getting theirs 30, 45 minutes or more after they ordered. So I opted for a beer.  30 minutes after that, with only one fleeting glimpse of the server, I left.  Yes, it was crowded. Yes I was there for the Ignite Phoenix after-party. But it's not like it was standing room only, and they had previous notice we were coming.  Walking out after an hour and a half to find your car towed (clearly not La Bocca's fault, and not a factor in the one star review) makes for a pretty lousy experience.   Too bad, looked like a cool place. But seriously, it's not that difficult to pour a beer.  And don't park, ever, on the southeast corner of Mill and 7th street.  UPDATE: I just had to stop back by and give props to the owner Julian, who contacted me via Yelp and apologized for my poor experience. No excuses, no fluff. That's commendable, and the right way to do business.   I'll have to go back and take him up on that drink offer....

After a disappointing lunch at the near-by Cantina Laredo, my wife and I decided to try the Brio Tuscan Grill for dinner (and no, we don't normally eat out twice in one day. It was our anniversary, so we splurged).  Let me tell you, the Brio Tuscan Grille was the polar opposite of Cantina Laredo.  At the recommendation of our fabulous server Asia, we both started off with the lobster bisque. This was a thing of beauty. Rich, creamy and delightful, it was a meal in and of itself.  I had the Pasta Alla Vodka, a "Delicate handmade pasta filled with Ricotta cheese, tossed with crispy prosciutto, garlic, basil and a Tomato Parmesan cream sauce" (and no vodka...). $14.95. Asia suggested adding a grilled chicken breast, which complemented it very well (and wound up only be $2 more).   My wife had Roasted Chicken & Butternut Squash Risotto, "Sautéed with garlic, crispy prosciutto, Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and basil", also $14.95. I don't do squash, but the bride reported it was "cooked to perfection".  Despite the healthy portions and the rich food, we had to have the stupid desert tray brought over. Big mistake as they were impossible to pass up. We opted to share a Creme Brulee Dolchino Trio Sampler. These were served in little espresso cups and our sampler included caramel, vanilla bean, and banana foster varieties. This stuff is really good, and good for ya! All were fantastic, and the sampler size was more than adequate for both of us, especially after gorging on the pasta and bisque.  Service was impeccable and the atmosphere was great.   Total bill for two, with two cocktails, two appetizers, two entrees and one desert was $67.67 (not including tip).   We'll definitely be back!

This was a stop on the East Valley Friday Nights tour (#evfn).  Have to say, the seafood chowder was spectacular. A cup of spicy goodness second to none. I also indulged in the fried clam platter, that included french fries and a delightful vinegary (not mayo-ey) cole slaw.  Service was *very* good, especially considering we were a relatively large group asking for the dreaded separate checks that so many establishments seem to forbid. Not so at the Sign of the Whale.  Owner Bruce was there, and told us the meaning of the name. A very nice guy that obviously takes his restaurant business seriously.  Nice atmosphere, great food, decent beer selection. The only thing keeping this place form getting a coveted fifth star is it was uncomfortably warm. In defense of the establishment, this was the early evening in Phoenix in July and is was like 187 degrees outside. They cranked the AC down, but it couldn't keep up.  Need to take a trip back for the burgers. They looked and smelled fantastic.   Burgers and chowder?  Yup.

Food, service, ambiance -- that's why I go to a restaurant. I suspect I am not alone.  La Calabria *nails* in on two of those three criteria. The food was fantastic. I had the Cannelloni - a simple dish, but done wrong it can be a miserable experience. La Calabria did it right. Way right.   My lovely bride had the Chicken Marsala. Given how she fended off my reaching fork, I'd say it was also outstanding.   Service was superior. And friendly. The owner stopped by twice just to make sure things were right. Our party of seven just mumbled and nodded our heads because our mouths were stuffed full of Italian goodness.  The only place La Calabria is lacking is in ambiance. They've done about everything they can with the space but it's not real warm and cozy. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad, just not as perfect as the food and service.   Yelp needs to allow half-stars, because La Calabria really is a 4.5 star kind of place.   Go. Eat. Be Merry.

Yelp needs the ability to add a sixth star...  Not much to add to what's already been written here. Gangplank rocks my world.  Several wannabe geeks whose day job entails selling real estate got all fired up to find an open collaborative workspace where we could talk real estate and get our geek on.  Gangplank offered up some space, and we're off to the races.  Let's face it. It takes special people to welcome a bunch of real estate agents, lenders and title guys into their work place. Gangplank welcomes us with open arms. That's pretty freaking cool.

Walk into the huge humidor (I've lived in smaller apartments) at Casa Fuma and you may think you have died and gone to heaven.  It's overwhelming. But just ask the  proprietor, Cliff Coen, for help. He's a nice guy, and really knows his smokes.  I suppose people come in, buy a single cigar, a box, or some accessories and leave, but the ultimate coolness of Casa Fuma won't be absorbed unless you hang out. They've got comfy couches, free WiFi, and flat screen TVs. Even an outside patio. The place has a Cheers-like atmosphere with lots of regulars, but first-timers (such as myself) are greeted warmly and made to feel right at home.  They have lots of events, from "Movie night" to visits with cigar makers and company executives, and an informative web site.  This was my first visit to Casa Fuma; it will not be my last.

Buying a car is usually a painful experience.  Not so at Carmax.  They've got a *great* website, with tons of photos of a fantastic selection of used cars. You can practically shop on-line, then go to Carmax for a test drive. Their in-house financing had extremely competitive rates.  No smarmy used car salesmen. No "bait & switch" offers. Just straight shooting, no hassle pricing. And the prices are VERY good.   The car we bought had a non-functioning navigation system. We knew this up front -- Carmax promised to fix it. I'll admit, my first thought was, "You watch, this is going to be a pain in the ass".  I was wrong. We brought the car back, they provided a loaner and we were on our way. Turns out they had to get it to a dealer, and they took care of all that. Picked the car up the next day.   Their service area is immaculate, and everyone we interacted with -- the sales person, the finance people and the service people were all first class.  It's as painless as car buying can get.

We just sold the car we bought at Carmax that spawned the original review here almost three years ago.  As with the purchase, the sale was ridiculously simple. The appraisal took about 20 minutes, and came in ABOVE Kelley Blue Book "excellent condition" trade in value -- and the car was in good - very good condition, but certainly not excellent.  A fair price, and no hassle. At a car dealership. Who'd have thunk it?

Found a flyer stuck on my door the other day for Mafia Mike's pizza. Normally I find these things annoying and just trash them, but I happened to be hungry. And lazy. And they deliver.  So I ordered up a "Big Buffalo Chicken" pizza. Buffalo style chicken chunks (spicy, but not too much so) with a ranch dressing base instead of traditional tomato based.   And I devoured the the entire pie (with help from two teenagers who declared the pizza "Effing AWESOME!!)  The wife got some Hawaiian style. Personally I find fruit on pizza to be fundamentally wrong, but she said it was fabulous.  Grab the cheesy crusty bread things too.

My 17 year old son had been feeling poorly for several days. When he woke to a 103 degree fever, I said "Time to see the doctor". The young buck, who seems to think he is invincible and normally pitches a fit when he has to go to the doc said, "Yeah, like right now".  Having not been to an Urgent Care facility in forever, I hit the internet and found Alliance Urgent Care on Higley, just south of the Banner Gateway Hospital. They have an online patient info form you can fill out to speed up processing. Very cool.  We arrived and were swiftly seen by Dr. Nick Williams. He was very caring, compassionate and thorough.  Much more so than many UC docs I've experienced. He took time to explain things, and his course of action (diagnosis was pneumonia). Dr. Williams told us to call back if we had any questions or concerns, didn't order a bunch of unnecessary tests, and was just an all around great MD.  I'd like to think we'll never have a need for an Urgent Care facility again, but when/if we do, this is the place we'll go.

Update Aug 13, 2010: Stopped by J Ruggs today, only to find it closed for business. :(  -----  Any time I see "Southern" in a BBQ restaurant name, I *have* to try it. And I go in a little skeptical.  Texas is home for me, and both parental units hail from southern middle Tennessee. So I understand and appreciate southern BBQ -- and it's not easy to find out here in the wild west.  Pulled up in the parking lot and it smelled perfect. A good sign.  Walked in and the lady behind the counter said, "How y'all doin tonight?  A better sign...  Sadly, and I mean sadly, we were informed they were out of brisket. Granted, they were set to close in about 30 minutes, so it was understandable. But for this Texas boy, brisket is the ultimate factor in deciding a BBQ restaurant's fate. I did take heart when one of the owners told me that he learned to smoke brisket in Houston, and they smoke their brisket for 14 hours.  I had a two meat plate, chicken and sausage, and the lovely bride had half a rack of baby back ribs.  All three meats were delightful. The ribs were done with just a dry rub, and were fall off the bone tender. Sausage was just the right level of spiciness. The chicken breast was huge, Dolly Partonesque in size.   The mac-n-cheese was excellent, full of cheesy goodness.  J. Ruggs is family owned and operated, and the owners are very friendly and cordial. You can tell they take pride in their food. Prices are very reasonable, especially when you consider the size of the portions.  We'll be back, and if the brisket is as good as I suspect it will be, J, Ruggs will be upgraded to a coveted fifth star.

My lovely bride and I decided to get inked to celebrate our 20th anniversary (yeah, we're hopeless romantics. For the record, it was her idea).  Prior to this venture, I had a grand total of one tattoo, she had zero. So we don't have a whole lot of experience in this world.  But I have been to a few tattoo shops in my day and can definitely say 5th Estate was the least.... seedy... one I've seen. The shop was spotless, the music was great and more importantly, all the people that worked there were totally cool.  They treated us with respect and dignity, even though we weren't looking for huge artistic projects. The wife got a small rose on her shoulder and I had a rose added to my existing tat of the state of Texas.  Lex was the shizz. Super cool guy, and a terrific artist. VERY reasonable prices and the work was flawless.  We may not ever be back, but that's just because the three tats in our combined 101 years of existence makes for low odds of getting more ink. But if I do get another one, I'll be going to Lex at 5th Estate.

Ever tried to teach a 16 year old girl to drive?  It'll make you want to buy stock in adult diaper companies.  I swiftly realized that stomping on the floorboard with no brake pedal, clawing at the dashboard and yelling STOP! DAMMIT STOP! at my lovely daughter wasn't a very effective training method.  Thank goodness for Eric and N Control Driving School. Eric was *fantastic*. He was funny, cordial, and immediately put my daughter (and her parents) at ease.  Eric arrived, explained to all of us what he'd be doing and off they went in a pretty new car, with "STUDENT DRIVER" plastered all over it.  Two hours later they returned (with the car in one piece) and I was amazed at the difference in my daughter's driving. She was FAR more confident in her skills. It was like night and day.  We'll likely do a couple more sessions with N Control, and then she'll be off to the races -- figuratively speaking.

Went here for a post-conference "after party / happy hour". (The fabulous Mortgage Tech Summit. If you're in the real estate biz and missed it, you screwed up...)  The beer selection is marginal at best, though the African Amber was quite tasty.  Someone ordered some dish that was nacho-like -- potato chips with bacon, ranch, "buffalo sauce", and blue cheese. It was delightful. (You could put those ingredients on a piece of cardboard and it would be good. It's way better on crunchy potato chips though).  What I liked the best was the great service. Brittany kicked ass. She managed to keep my beer full and did separate checks for a crowd of 30ish that was constantly shifting around. All with a cheery smile.  Why do they call it "Happy Hour"? Shouldn't it be "Happy Hours"?? I mean really, does anyone stay for just one hour?

(Full disclosure: Proprietor Steve Belt is a friend of mine, but trust me, if he'd goofed this up, I'd say so...)  Here I sit, sucking up the free wifi at Scottsdale's newest independently owned coffee shop, Echo Coffee.  Over by the comfy couches and chairs, there's a coffee roaster cooking away as I type (TV is on the way). Steve is serious about his coffee and is watching over that thing like a mother hen.   Some delightful looking fresh-baked cookies and pastries and a basket of fresh fruit are available if you're hungry. (Steve & company are fleshing out the menu).  The atmosphere is great, and there's been a steady stream of customers coming in.  Oh, and the coffee is spectacular.   My only beef is it's not in Gilbert and closer to home. I could hang out in a place like this all day....

Chain, but new location recently opened on the northwest corner of Val Vista and Baseline.  Friendly staff, clean restaurant and the cheese steaks are **killer**.   One glance at the bulbous flab hanging over my belt will tell you that I can pack away the food. But a medium size cheese steak (12") fills me up. Can't imagine downing the large (20") solo. It's stuffed with meat on soft toasty bread.   Get the shrooms too, you'll thank me.

What a cool little antiques store!  Granted, my knowledge of antiques is limited to what I've learned by watching Antiques Road Show on PBS, but still, this place is cool. It's in an old house (built in the 1930s) which adds to the charm.  It's a small shop, but is packed full of all sorts of things from furniture down to personal pieces and everything in between. Prices seem very reasonable, but again, I am far from expert in this area.    The owner Claire is super nice, and quite the astute businesswoman.   They are in the process of building a garden behind the shop, and with Claire's husband being an landscape professional, I'm betting it will knock your socks off!

My insurance basically dictated where I had to go to get my windshield replaced.   As I sit in there waiting room, waiting for the adhesive to cure, I find myself thankful Safelite was the place they sent me.  The front desk clerk was swift and efficient, the tech that did the work was courteous and seemed to know what he was doing and the replacement glass looks great.  They'd get a fifth star if they had wifi and a table so I didn't have to use my aircard and make this laptop REALLY a laptop..  And yes, they'll come to your location too, but calling out some poor slob to replace a windshield when it's 400 degrees outside didn't seem like a very nice thing to do. Same day appointment made it easy enough to bring it into the shop where the guys could work in the AC.  Total repair time, including the waiting period as only 1.5 hours.  And get full glass coverage on your auto insurance. The cost of this replacement paid for that coverage for about 20 years...

I like this place.  I was with the previously mentioned group of EVFN'ers. We can be a loud, obnoxious group at times and we tend to keep servers confused by playing musical chairs.  But Brandon was cool, he even handled the people hassling him about his shoes with ease. (And seriously, his shoes? Who cares?). Ashley was excellent, and pretty easy on the eyes too. Of course that shouldn't really matter, but it does...  I had the Haddock fish and chips, which was *excellent*. I wasn't sure what to do with the curry stuff that came with it but damn, anything with curry and whole chunks of garlic has got to be fabulous. I just ate it with a fork and dipped my fish in it. Whether I did that right or not, it was delightful.  A decent (though not overwhelming) beer selection. Pub-like atmosphere, good food, good service. What's not to like?
