Terrible service! Waited 30 min to get a table when half of the tables are empty.  Only one person in charge. Dirty bathrooms.

Disappointing dinner. We used to go there with the previous Owners but the first time since they changed ownership.. We had the hot pot sour coconut soup (Thom Kha Gai). The soup had no taste and after eating half of it, we found a dead fly into it.  It was disgusting.

Fun cosmic Friday night bowling with a great DJ. Awesome to go when you don't feel like clubbing in a late Friday or Saturday night.  We had free bowling coupon that they did not want to accept since it was Friday night. The coupons did not have any restrictions on them. Quite disappointing.

Although I usually like the food there, last night episode was really bad!  I ordered the Jambalaya and after eating a few bites, found a one inch long metal wire in it.  The manager replace the dish very rapidly for the same. Not sure if I will be able to go back there with that experience.

Great place for Breakfast!  Great price, traditional Las Vegas spot, quiet and off the strip. Excellent food with large portion. Service was also excellent!

I have been using and bringing a lot of my clients to work with Driggs Title, escrow officer Steve Rogers. We have completed at least 50 transactions together in the past 12 months.  Service has always been excellent, fast response from escrow officer and very knowledgeable.  I continue to recommend this company to my clients and friends.

Great creative menu and excellent service. The food was tasty and loved the atmosphere. Excellent lighting... Not too bright and not too dark. Fun younger trendy crowd.
