Loco is one of my go-to spots in Old Town. I probably visit once a week, at least for their Taco Tuesday. I crave their chips and salsa on a daily basis. I don't know what they do to it but it's so fresh. SO FRESH.  You can't go wrong with much of anything on their menu but my favorites are their steak tacos and protein bowl. Even their house margaritas are good, they taste nothing like the electric yellow mix crap you see in grocery stores. Overall for pricing and quality/freshness of food you get it doesn't get better  The only reason I can't give 5 stars is because service is really hit or miss. My bf and I are honestly one of the lowest maintenance tables you could have, seriously you won't see us looking at a stopwatch to see exactly how minutes went by before waters are refilled, but we've had a few experiences where our server has disappeared forever.  With that being said, food and drinks always comes out super quick even when they're busy!

I'm no expert but this has got to be one of the best dealerships in Arizona. I actually visited Big Two for a Honda that I had found through the car buying service my insurance company offers.  I worked with Rick Kanitz in Fleet/Internet and Charlie Morello in finance, both awesome guys!  They were respectful, helpful, honest, and never made me feel like they were trying to take advantage of me, which was especially important to me considering this was my first time buying a car. I had such a great experience that my boyfriend recently went to them for maintenance on his Tundra, and we will definitely be sending friends and family their way for future Toyotas!

I've been here 3 or 4 times now and have yet to be disappointed. Great atmosphere, patio is cute and service is always on point.  as for food..  THE SALSICCIA PIZZA CHANGED MY LIFE. I've never been a huge pizza fan (weird I know) but I crave this pizza regularly. I couldn't tell you much about the other pizzas because I can't not order this when I go. As for drinks/ apps I highly recommend calamari or create your own meat/cheese board and you can't go wrong with any of their cocktails. Try the basil gimlet!!

Passport coffees and teas are equally amazing, and I love that they are local!   I first noticed their tropical iced tea (OBSESSED)  at a lot of the restaurants in the Scottsdale area, especially Sam Fox locations. I'm in love because it doesn't have a funky, chemical taste that some of the low quality teas have.  I came across their coffee when I was out to breakfast and asked what it was, and of course was Passport- I'm assuming a house blend since it wasn't flavored?  I just ordered my first bag of whole bean Vanilla Hazelnut, and am sure I'll be going back to try every single other flavor because they all sound amazing. I'll continue to eat out wherever I can find my tropical iced tea :)

I've been here twice for dinner,  once for a date and  again for a group dinner with friends. CPH has a great atmosphere for both.  The chopped salad is a must, and the scallops and short ribs are great entrees. The cocktails are crafty and delicious! Overall a good spot to visit, especially if you have friends or family in town.

I am so impressed with Lucky Me! Heather made everything so simple for me before I left for a 9 day vacation. Sandy took care of my cat Joe and did such an amazing job! your pet care taker leaves  notes every day letting you  know how they are eating, behaving and everything they do to help you such as litter scooping, brushing and playing.  The best part is that they come to your home so your cat or dog doesn't have to feel stressed in an unknown environment. I will definitely be using Lucky Me in the future! Thank you Heather and Sandy!!

I've been here a few times for breakfast, and have always left disappointed. The menu is pretty basic, so I feel as though I'm paying for something I could easily make at home. The coffee always tastes a little burnt, and the last time we visited our server forgot about us for no joke 40 minutes. I don't see myself going back.  If you're looking for a good breakfast/brunch spot definitely opt for Daily Dose down the street.

Things at Salty Sow you need to eat before you die:  Fried Green Tomatoes (come with guac) Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms Cheese Grits Crispy Brussels Sprouts  I can't even tell you what their entrees are like because I blackout from a food high on appetizers alone, but I've heard great things about their fried chicken. They have a great HH on Monday nights, awesome patio and live music though I forget which days. This is always a place I introduce to family or friends from out of town for good vibes, great food and an awesome Dirty Martini.

I have never had such amazing customer service in a nail salon before! I tried out the SNS manicure, a little pricey at $35, but hopefully worth the money considering how long it's supposed to last. It has only been 5 days but so far so good! As I left they promised that if for whatever reason I wasn't happy with my nails or the color, that they would fix them right away.  As for the actual SNS mani: compared to gel, the nail definitely appears 'thicker' You can tell there are layers of powder/polish so if you like a bit more of a natural look, you might prefer gel over SNS. I would say SNS looks like a happy medium between a gel mani and an acrylic nail.  Other than that, they have a good polish selection and I will definitely be trying out a pedicure as my next service. From what I saw they use the proper sanitization methods with their bowls and tools.  Overall- very good experience!
