Literally no competition. Rolled tacos are awesome, California burritos are to die for...with shoes string fries as the potatoes, and the breakfast burritos with eggs, bacon, and cheese (add potatoes)....are the BEST. Don't judge a book by its cover, as you will miss out. Family owned.

Have eaten here and usually love it.  Last night I went and was really excited, but after the service I got I highly doubt I will return.   In short I ordered first out of three friends. They had two people working the front counter, one that took my order and one that charged me. Even though someone took my order to make, the cashier input it incorrectly and the receipt somehow got the chefs to make the wrong sized order.   While my friends ate even though I ordered first they come out w the smaller size. I told him they got it wrong and can I pay the difference or return the order and get the proper order.  He tries to sell me two Pinners which came to a price more than the blunt even tho I just wanted what I ordered. After debating the logic of his I just want the blunt size at blunt price...and that it was really their mistake...he informs me there is an iPad to make sure the order is correct. Apparently its my job to make sure they correctly do their job. Being the cashier never asked me to validate my order...I never knew the iPad was for validating purchase. I ended up not getting what I wanted and left unhappy.   Apparently it was my bad. Thanks for that above and beyond customer service large native american employee. You just lost my business.  Still not sure why the first guy even took my order.

One of the managers responded to my honest review and gave me a number to call so he could better understand. After listening and understanding the challenge, he accepted responsibility, apologized, and offered to make it up to me.    This IMO was great customer service, and I am excited to allow Cheeba hut back into the fold of dining considerations.  P.S. Cheeba Hut tastes delicious even when seethingly angry :)

Well from the reviews you can tell they are NOT trustworthy!  Our story: Dr Babarinde from Palm Tree Pediatrics performed a circumcision at Banner Del Webb hospital on my newborn on 12/12/2014. Just a couple days ago, (7/13/2016) I receive a call from a collections company stating that I have a bill that was never paid that they are working to collect on. 19 months later and this is the first I have heard anything! I do not pay my bills late and I have an excellent credit standing. All of the bills I received from the hospital for the birth of my baby have been paid in full. I never received a bill from Palm Tree Pediatrics because if I had it would have been paid. So I ask the collections agent why I never received a bill and she states that they had a bad address and the bills were undelivered. The address Palm Tree Pediatrics had was an address that the hospital had on file from 31 years ago when my mother had me at Thunderbird Samaritan (now Banner Thunderbird). I actually never lived at that address. I gave the hospital my new address SEVERAL times and all my other hospital bills made it to my home and were paid. Palm Tree Pediatrics wants to charge me a collection fee because they sent this bill to collections without verifying my address or calling to confirm it afterwards. They have another complaint on Yelp.com regarding a bill being sent to collections and it seems they have too many clients and just send everything to collections without following proper procedures to verify addresses. I should not be held responsible for a collections fee as I provided Banner Del Webb with the correct address and had Dr. Babarinde asked for my address, this would not have been an issue. Banner Del Webb sent me all the hospital bills to the correct address with no problem. Her staff (Athena and Tabitha in billing) are unreasonable and would rather charge me a collection fee than to have a happy client. I actually heard Athena in billing tell someone else in the office "she won't shut up" (referring to me) while I was on the phone with her! I have informed BBB and will be informing the hospital staff, my doula, Facebook, as well as other moms who plan to use this company if this isn't resolved.

The Raspados are so dang good, my wife and I are pretty much addicted. The guy was very helpful as they have a lot of real fruit choices to pick from. Great value as well.   Better than just ice cream like the other reviewer mentioned.
