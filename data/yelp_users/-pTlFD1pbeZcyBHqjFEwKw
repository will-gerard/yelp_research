I am pleased to announce that Macaroni Grill now has happy hour and a pretty darn good one! Appetizers are $5 and their house Chianti, Chardonnay and Zinfendal's are only $3. Our favorite appetizer is prosciutto wrapped mozzarella served in a delicious red sauce accompanied by grilled garlic toaster points. We typically stop in once a week and say hello to our favorite bar tender Dariya, who by the way remembered us after only one visit. She is always cheerful and makes our experience all the more enjoyable.

I took my husband here for his 40th birthday and we were both very impressed. The atmosphere was beautiful. We were fortunate enough to have a table near the window so we had a fantastic view of the valley at sunset. Our waiter was fantastic (not stuffy) and the food impeccable.   Obviously on the pricey side, but that is to be expected for an establishment such as this. Might catch a star or two. We saw Steve Nash at the bar.

Just had dinner with my husband, my parents, and my in-laws last night! We were fortunate to have dinner in there wine cellar in the basement. It was very intimate with all the wine bottles around our table and candles lit around the room. Four of us ordered the famous Chocolate Espresso rubbed pork tenderloin which definitely lived up to its reputation. Very flavorful and savory! My mother ordered the Buttermilk Chicken with sweet potatoes and it was a great down home cooking, stick to your ribs dish that you would remember from home. The green chile stew was my husbands favorite. It had a slight kick to it, but was very tender with the perfect blend of spices.   Our server was fantastic and had great wine and menu recommendations. Which we followed and were not disappointed. If you are looking for authentic Southwestern cuisine this is the place!

My husband and I went here for Happy Hour on Valentines Day and I must say, we intended to have dinner as well but the healthy portions took us by surprise. Everything we ordered was wonderful. We had the classic shrimp cocktail (they actually gave an even number (4) instead of most restaurants that give you an odd (3, 5) amount so someone goes without. Followed by the Beef Carpaccio (fantastic). Then we split the Prime Burger (Bacon/Cheddar) YUM. An order of the Cajun Shrimp (perfectly spiced) and last but not least a clean finish of Seared Ahi.   And you wonder why dinner was out of the question. Everything was priced at $6 including certain wine and cocktail selections. Well worth it and the happy hour is available nightly till 7pm.   We are looking forward to returning soon for our main course and will definitely be back with some friends for Happy Hour!

Now being a native, I've tried many a restaurant here in the greater Phoenix area. My favorite cuisine Japanese. When City North 1st opened, I was very excited to learn we were getting a teppanyaki/sushi restaurant so close to home. On my 1st visit to Saito's I was immediately impressed with the atmosphere, very contemporary, upscale, modern. The bar is beautiful with a nice waterscape in the center.   My husband and I were immediately welcomed by the manager and she gave us a great tour of the sushi rolls/menu. We ordered a couple specialty rolls (large variety on the menu) to try and they were both fantastic! Other happy hour items that we sampled were the 5 spice chicken, harumaki (springrolls), and BBQ spare ribs. All equally good and the happy hour pricing cannot be beat. Items range from $2-$6 and drinks are $3 - $5. We have been repeat customers for the last six months and have enjoyed there teppanyaki on several occasions. The chef's are well above average and great entertainers. Not the typical Benihana commercial experience. The filet mignon melts in your mouth and the scallops are excellent. Very large portion sizes as well.   My only criticism is that it is not heavily advertised and because of that it is seldom busy. Not enough people know about this hidden gem and its right in their own backyard! We have truly enjoyed getting to know the staff, the fantastic cuisine, and the ambiance the place sets off. A great treat if your looking for something different than your average Kona experience. If your in this neck of the woods, its a must try if you love sushi and Japanese cuisine!!!! Don't be deterred if the place isn't as rockin as its neighbors i.e. Blue Martini, you will enjoy what I feel is City North's maybe even North Phoenix's best kept secret! A must try!

Alas, Saitos is no more. (At least the AZ location) I was very upset to see another great restaurant close its doors... It will be sorely missed. To Cleo and the rest staff we have come to know and love, I am very sorry to see you go and wish you all well in your future endeavors.

Its hard for me to give this restaurant a higher star rating. This is not due to the food by any means. The food is excellent and very genuine. I do however, take issue with the service. Everyone is pleasant enough, but none of the wait staff or take out order employees seem to have any concept of time. I have dined in at the restaurant for lunch a couple of times with other colleagues. We have a typical hour lunch break and this establishment is a mere 5 mins away. Lets just say both times we told the server we would be in a hurry due to work and both times we were at least 20 to 30 minutes late. Lesson learned. So we resorted to calling in our order for pick up. We were told it would be ready in 10 mins.   That was a sheer fabrication as both times we arrived and paid and waited for another 30 minutes for our food at the pick up window. (AKA bar). Now, why do we keep giving them another chance? Well, that's simple, it is the only authentic indian food in a 10 mile radius. Trust me, if we had other options we'd take them.   Bottom line: Great Food! Crap Service!

Must say one of the best burgers I have ever had! I had the number one (caramelized onion, gorgonzola, crescenza, bacon, arugala, & 1000 Island dressing) with your choice of meat/veggies.  The bistro setting adds a certain flare to the entire experience. Burgers are decadent, exploding with flavor and richness. Decently priced for an upscale burger joint.  Appetizers are a little on the pricey side for what they offer.

Love, love, love Tanzy. We come in almost every Sunday for brunch. The quartet of mimosas is awesome and the brunch choices are wonderful. The build your own omlette, chicken caesar salad and Tanzy burger are all delicious choices. In all of our time coming here,  we have never had anything we didn't like. Carla was our bartender this last visit and she made our dining experience absolutely fabulous. She is very outgoing and delightful to speak with. Very knowledgeable about the menu and cocktail offerings. She always makes us feel at home here.

Went to the Grand Opening last night and that hour/20 minute wait was well worth it! Hands down the best Chicago style Italian Beef Sandwich I have ever had! My husband lived in Chicago for 12 years and was very happy and impressed with the food and service. It is exactly what he remembered. We had a Hot Dog and Chili Cheese dog too! Both excellent, but the Italian Beef Sandwich is what I will be coming back for!!

Just went to Modern Margarita's VIP party last night and had a wonderful time. The d√©cor is contemporary and the patio is fantastic! The first thing that you notice when you walk in is the open bar which has seating all around from the inside and outside patio creating a seamless transition from indoor to outdoor. We were able to sample the Modern, Sonoran, Yoga and Spicy Mango margaritas as well as a variety of their menu items. The Modern Margarita is the classic, the Sonoran fruitier, the Yoga (Skinny Girl) a play on the classic with Triple Sec and Seltzer to give it some bubbles and the Spicy Mango is definitely what it says it is! My personal favorite was the Yoga.    The food consists of some of the best chips, salsa and guacamole I have ever had as well as an assortment of street tacos, small plates and burgers. We had the pork and chicken street tacos which were equally delicious. I can't wait to go back and try some of the other menu items! Hands down my new favorite ultra-chic margarita mecca.

All I can say is wow. I absolutely love this place. The sheer elegance and sophistication the moment you walk in will take your breath away. I have been coming here since they opened. The quality of the nail technicians is top notch. Notably Toni, Kelly, Taylor and Heather. All are fabulous and take the time and care to make sure you are happy with your nails.  From nail art to rock star glitter nails to classic french, they can do all. Not to mention the coffee and wine bar is awesome.  One drink is included with each service.  The best part about this place is the caring and professional owner "Tracy"! She is awesome.  She has remembered me from my 1st appointment and takes very good care of her clients.  She personally greets you and brings your beverages and chocolates.  She truly cares about your experience and patronage.  A lovely and quality individual.  I have referred all of my friends and family to M3V and will continue to do so. Best nail bar and best service in this industry.  Much love and respect from a very happy client! !
