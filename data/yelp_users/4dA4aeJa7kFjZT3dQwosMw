I really like this place. They are friendly, the pedicures last a long time and the price is the lowest around for a spa pedicure! I highly recommend!

I have to preface this review by saying my family and I have taken our cars here for years. I have had nothing but wonderful things to say about Exclusive Collision Center and have recommended them to anyone and everyone I know. Until now that is. To say I am disappointed is an understatement! I am very saddened and quite disgusted by how I was recently treated by Jeremy and his staff.   I went to Jeremy to get an estimate on my car on 5/1/16. He welcomes me with a hug and was more than friendly and accommodating ensuring me they will take care of my car and make the process as seamless as possible, even offering to take me to the airport after I dropped off my car and return it to my house before I got back in town that Sunday. Now that's service I thought. Here's where it goes bad.   I returned in town on Sunday to find my garage empty, my car was not delivered. This meant I couldn't go to work the next day even though Charlene ensured me she'd call that Friday with any updates. Since I didn't hear I figured all was well and I'd have my car when I returned. I called first thing Monday morning and Charlene told me my car wouldn't be done until almost close of business and that they could no longer deliver my car, I'd have to take an Uber. So, I showed up at 3:30 pm as directed only to find that only half of the work promised was completed. To boot, they had already charged my credit card for the full amount and my car was there for 7 days for a pretty minor fix. They said there was a miscommunication and they'd speak with Jeremy (who gave me the estimate) and get back to me by the latest Wed. I didn't get a call by Wed. so on Thurs. I called and was assured by Charlene that Jeremy would give me a call back. No call on Thurs. either and on Friday they were closed. So, first thing Monday morning I called and once again asked to speak to Jeremy, with no luck. At this point, I now ask for my money back for the work that wasn't done. Charlene offers for me to bring the car back, to which I told her I can't do, and once again says she'll call me that day with an update, yet no call once again. Still no call from Jeremy either. To make matters worse, they had reimbursed me for the Uber I took down to pick up my car and the check bounced and I incurred an additional charge. So, today, 5/17/16 I called back and spoke to Charlene, very upset at this point, only to be told that they did the work promised and that is that.   WOW is all I can say! While I've had positive experiences in the past, clearly things have changed there and customer service is no longer a priority. Had Jeremy just taken the time to give me a call, perhaps we could have resolved the issue. I would be very leery of taking your car there now. It just isn't what it use to be and it'll be more trouble than the money you may save.

I have been to about 5 different places for shellac manicures.  Like many, when I see a "deal" for one, I grab it.  I don't get regular manicures often because they don't last and shellac is suppose to last about 2 weeks.  With that said, I had yet to find a place that actually gave you a manicure in addition to painting your nails with the shellac polish and that lasted the promised 2 weeks. They all call it a manicure but the result is never actually that.  Gaylee however, actually gave me a manicure (cut my cuticles, buffed and filed my nails, massage, etc.) AND it lasted ...what's going on 3 1/2 weeks.  Now, I know that sounds ridiculous but I refuse to take it off because the polish is still perfect (other than the nail growth that is getting quite obvious).  On all other occasions, the polish  started to chip in under a week, but not this time! I highly recommend Gaylee!!  She's very friendly as well!  The only partial complaint I have is that she is somewhat hard to get an appointment with but clearly it's because she's that good!

What a great new concept!  I love how you can create your own sushi roll.  You start by selecting brown or white rice, seaweed or soy paper then veggies, meat/fish and top it with your choice of sauce(s).  If you aren't creative they have some menu items already created for you.  And, to also note, if you aren't a fish fan, they have chicken and beef as well.  Each roll comes with 10 pieces, so portions are big.  The food is fresh and it was a blast to create my own roll. I will definitely go back!!!  Well done!
