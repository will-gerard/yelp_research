Food was absolutely amazing! I got a carafe of cab and the non vegetarian dinner, which comes with a bit of everything. The chicken curry was by far the best curry I've eaten. But in all honesty everything from the naan to the rice to the pistachio ice cream and tea was amazing. I will definitely be back and often since the prices are pretty reasonable. I took one star off because the servers seemed bothered that we were there and weren't entirety helpful when we had questions, one server kept whispering everything then just basically walked away before seeing if we understood. Thankfully my friend was there who is a veteran Indian food eater and explained all the meal items to me.

My boyfriend took me here for a surprise dinner last night and it was wonderful. Being able to BYOB is an amazing idea and more places should offer it. The food was absolutely wonderful, every bite was a treat. The prices are a little steep but way worth it in my mind. I loved that the tomatoes that were served with my meal were local and absolutely delicious. My bf wolfed them down and he normally hates veggies.   It's one of the many old houses turned restaurants near downtown and was very charming and the atmosphere was so comfortable. The ladies working there were delightful and helpful.  I'd definitely recommend it to anyone in the area or any visitors to the area.

My boyfriend and I have just recently discovered Keegan's and we are in love. The fact that their happy hour starts at 8 is by far the BEST thing ever. It also makes it our go to place. I'm pretty sure in the last two weeks after we 1st visited we've been back 5 or 6 times. The prices are perfect, the service is great and the food is really delicious. I wasn't putting a lot of hope in the food but everything that we've tried has been very good. My only suggestion would be that they turn down the grill and cook the food a bit longer. I had to have them remake one of my sliders and I've seen other situation were people asked for their food to be cooked more. But the food tastes so good that it isn't even an issue for me or my usually very picky boyfriend :) we just make sure to have them cook everything well. All in all, I dig this place and will continue to visit every few days or so.

I love small, friendly dive bars. They always have the best mix of people in there. And most are normally regulars so they know everyone and are always friendly to the new faces at the bar. Kat's is no different.  Cheap drinks, friendly bartenders, good people, jukebox, pool tables, video arcades, and a toy crane that can win you some porn. That's what I call a great bar.

Clean inside and clean kitchen. Nice staff and super good food. The chicken pita was good, not great but the salad was super good. I even liked that it had no feta.   The burger I had tried another time was SUPER good. Taste just like you made t at home but without having to mess up your kitchen. ;)   The hours are a little annoying because but that just means they take pride in their food when it is open.  I would definitely recommend everyone go give them a try.

Just got back from Ingleside Animal Hospital and I have to agree with some of the previous reviewers. The building is just lovely. I love how big and spacious it is. Some vet offices are so cramped and just not enough room to avoid other dogs.   My beautiful girl dog happens to not like too many other dogs so I usually HATE taking her alone to vets because it's such a hassle to care for her, fill out paperwork and try to keep other pets away from her. Definitely NOT the case here. She did so well with three other dogs in the room.   The staff was very nice and helpful. Dr. Bart listened to me and I really enjoyed the whole visit. So did Dee minus her getting her temperature taken. Haha. I did feel pressured to get unnecessary test or meds.  One of my other favorite parts was when it came to pay the bill. It was ACTUALLY fairly priced!!! What? Isn't that just crazy? A place that actually cares for the animals and doesn't overprice every little thing like 'oh your dog went the bathroom outside here's a $300 bill'. Nope, there was none of that. When the nice lady at the front told me the price I was taken back and in shock. A vet visit, exams and meds for less then $130!!! That's awesome!!!

This place is awful BEWARE you may want to go someone else that actually cares about they're customers and doesn't lie to them just to get a sale.  I bought a mattress set, was told it'd be delivered in the morning before Sat before 10a, I remember that because I thought to myself oh man I'm gonna have to wake up early, then Sat 11a comes around, I call to find out what's going on they said I was scheduled for an afternoon delivery, thanks sales lady, wouldn't be a huge issue excet that I have places to be in a few hours, the lady says she'll see what she can do, calls back 10 mins later, well your stuffs on the truck and they said it'll be 2 to 3 hours, WHAT?!, I proceeded to ask her what can I do, can they leave it in my backyard, she then decided to hang up on me. Wonderful!!  I will never give these rude unprofessional liars any of my money again. I wish I could just return the thing and go some where better. But they have a policy where all sales are final. Weird policy and now I'm guessing they do things like this a lot and that's why there is this policy.    I should have listened to my gut feeling while I was purchasing the set and walked out. So if you end up in this awful place and you have a great desire to run. RUN!!!!

If I could give a negative rating I would. With that said If you have to go here then go but...  A little over a year ago I had to go to the ER and after waiting for over two hours when there was no body in front of me and it was early and not busy I finally got seen by a doctor for like two minutes who was rude and then I never saw him again.   I had a lady come in and mop my room while the nurse was putting in an IV in my arm!!! Uhhh, hello, do you think could have maybe come back a little later?  I had another nurse who was there to take my blood pressure info just leave the machine on and it beeped for the next 15 mins until finally in all my pain (I later found out I had a kidney stone) I got up and asked someone to turn it off.   My nurse wouldn't give me any information about what the tests I was getting were for. The room was 71 degrees and I had to ask 3 different people for a warm blanket even AFTER my boyfriend called the nurses station from work to get them to bring me one.   The place seemed dirty and unsanitary, I mean I guess it was due to all the construction they had to wheel me through but even that was ridiculous. Oh yeah I almost forgot to mention the left over sticky things, the ones that they use to connect your heart to machines, in my gown that I noticed. I was never hooked to a heart machine... That means they were who ever had the gown on before I did. That's gross!.  Then I had to deal with all the payment info and not one person I talked to yet has been helpful. They all seem to be "busy" and rude and they act like I'm bugging them for calling the 800 number to get my payments squared away. Ugh!   Now, I have to deal with the billing folks again. Why, you ask? Oh because they decided not to send me my last bill and even after talking to mulitple people asking them to send me a bill to my new address and them agreeing to. I guess it was just easier to put my bill into collections. Thanks JCL! You guys are swell folks. So today I call in asking to see if we can get this fixed. That I WANT to pay my bill. That I had no intention of not paying it. That there was no reason for it to go into collections. Pat (the lady I spoke to) was no help, so I asked to talk to a supervisor or manager. She put me on hold for about 8 mins and then some how the phone call got disconnected (nice). So I called back, she didn't answer so I left a message. That was at 8am it's now 6pm and no phone call back. Geez that's great customer service.  If you have to go then go but if you can hold out for a better hospital then I recommend the extra driving in the end it will be less of a headache.

Bobby D's. Oh my what can I say about you? Except that I LOVE YOU!   Cheap drinks, jukebox filled with awesomeness, darts, video games, lots of tv's to watch the games on, amazing food (try the salad with grilled chicken you won't regret it), amazing staff (Barb is the best), the regualrs are super friendly, its a mix of young and old, and atmosphere is super relax.  Oh Bobby D's you're a little hole in the wall but you're one of my favorites and I wouldn't change a thing about you.

I went in yesterday for my 1st ever eye exam. Yeah, I know that's pretty bad since I'm 27 and stare at computer monitors all day long for a living but hey you're not my mother so quit judging me. Geez. Back to my review :)  I made an appointment with Prime Eye Care about three weeks ago. Bringing me to disappointment #1: I received no reminder call saying "Hey your appt is tomorrow, blah blah blah". Now I know it's MY appointment and they may have been busy but isn't it sort of the front desk persons job to call patients and remind them of scheduled appointments. Not such a big deal though. So, moving on.  Disappointment #2: The doctor had NO people skills at all. He just wanted to get this over with. I told him this was my 1st ever eye exam you'd think he'd at least let me know what's going on before sticking this and that in my eye. But no. All I got was a sit still, open your eyes, look up. I mean come on dude YOU'RE STICKING A FREAKIN LIGHT IN MY EYE. At least give a girl a heads up and all. It just would have been nice to have a little warning like "Hey, I'm going to have you look all over the place while I stick this uncomfortable rather bright light in your eye, do your best to stay as still as possible and keep your eyes open". But no I received nothing of the sort.  Then he puts these drops in my eyes and has me sit out in the waiting room. I had no idea why, so as I'm sitting there and my eyes begin to feel more and more awkward, I start to freak out a little. "Is this whats suppose to happen? Why can't I see? Oh no something's wrong". After being ushered to another exam room I come to find out that all that is normal, it's actually what was expected to happen. Thanks for the HEADS UP DOC. So then the doc comes back in with another damn light to stick in my eyes. Then he rambles off all this technical eye jargon that pretty much left me with a big fat "HUH". But I think I got the gist of it.  So now brings me to the disappointment #3 (the big one): I go to the front desk, pay my copay, no big deal then the front desk gentleman asked me if I had sunglasses, to which my reply was yes in the car. That was it. Nothing else. I had NO IDEA until I stepped out into the Arizona sun, scratch that the Arizona HOT BRIGHT AS HELL sun, to figure out why the gentleman asked me if I has sunglasses. Oh my god! A little warning that it was going to feel and look as though I was WALKING ON THE SUN would have been nice. I mean come on people! I couldn't see a damn thing until I got all the way back to my car and put my sunglasses on. My eyes were dilated for the next few hours, which would have also been nice to have been told about. I wouldn't have tried to go back to work had I know that little tid bit of info.  I gave a two because all in all, I got my eye exam over with so that was good. The doctor seemed like he knew what he was doing, so that was good. The office itself was rather nice looking. And I'm in a good mood this morning. I'm just used to a more friendly office visit. I wish they would have just talked to me is all. Is that too much to ask for?

I am so disappointed with Mi Patio.  I was so excited to go there tonight, get drunk, eat some great food then call Sunrise cab (see my other reviews) and head over to First Friday. But that is not what happened at all.  I first noticed that it wasn't too busy which to me was great but for a Friday night, kind of weird, especially with $1.75 margaritas. Awesome, right? Or so I thought.   I started off with the XL because I save 0.25 that way, me figuring I was going to be getting at least two. They were horrible!!!! They actually caused me physical pain, every sip I took it would cause my stomach to wrench up, I tried chasing every sip with water with no avail. There was no tequila in it at all, it tasted like straight up sweet and sour mix, well maybe expired sweet and sour mix that was left out in the sun for 2 or 3 days. When we asked our waiter about it he just said he didn't understand what we were saying, repeated the price and walked away. I'm a very passive person so no big deal to me. We just figured "what did we expect for $3.25". They were huge though so plus for that...???   The food was pretty good, that's what the one star is for. We shared the Baja Chicken Burro. I mean it wasn't anything spectacular but it had a good taste. Nothing that would make me come back though.  I'm glad we at least tried it and got it out of our system but we'll keep looking. I think maybe I built it up too much in my head. I would give them a 1.5 but I'm rounding down for the pain that was caused.

So I went back. I am super glad I did.  I had the spinach feta chimi and OH MY GOD so delicious that I actually was mmmmmmm-ing at the table. My friend actually pointed out that with every bite I took I did a little happy dance.  So good!!!  Stayed as far away from the margaritas and just stuck with H2O. I'll definitely go back for the food.

Gross is the one word that comes to mind when I think of where we had my nieces 3rd birthday party. This location has to be the dirtiest, stickiest, worn down place I've ever been into. Which is pretty sad since it's for children. A lot of the games and rides didn't work. The customer service there was awful. They didn't even remove our dirty plates after we ate our pizza, we had to put them on the table next to ours and they were sitting there as we left. All of the animated animals or whatever you'd call them looked like sad, worn out, crackheads with lazy and/or unopened eyes as they danced/flailed around. The place didn't even do anything for the birthday girl. No Chuck E walking around, no ticket booth, no happy birthday song, pure crap.  They really need to close down for a few days, clean and sanitize the entire place, fix the broken games and rides and have a "how to treat customers" seminar. I DO NOT recmommend this location.

I left here full, not stuffed, satisfied and a fan of this delicious little establishment. I just left and already I can't wait to go back. The burger was cooked to perfection and the fries and poppers were a lovely addition to my meal.

It's been at least three months since my last vist but that's because I'm not a morning perosn and by the time I rise the doors are closed. With that being said...  I took my sister who was visiting form Seattle here and it was amazing. We had iced coffee's and I believe they said homemade jam and some bread. The jam was d-lish and the coffee was great.   I used to be a big coffee drinker but now-a-days i barely ever drink the stuff, it hurts my stomach whenever I do. Not the case at Drip. The coffee was perfect and not a single stomach ache.  When I was there they offered free wi-fi, a thumbs up move in my opinion, had adequate seating and the atmosphere was quiet and comfortable not like Starbucks. The women helping us was a delight to talk to as well.  One day, soon, I'll have to wake up and visit again. Any of you coffee lovers that live or work in the area should definitely go check it out.

Haven't been to The Lost Leaf outside of First Friday but it is always a stop on that night. Love it!   It's crowded, loud, and there has never been a place for us to sit down but it has great beer and the atmosphere is just awesome. Another great reason to go, is that it's not filled with morons or those typical rude people that love to frequent most places I enjoy.  The local art that covers the walls is pretty sweet and usually right up my alley.  One day I'll venture out to The Lost Leaf on a day other then Friday.

It was just ok. Didn't care to much for the hummus which really disappoints me because I believe every Greek restaurant should know how to make a darn good hummus. You know what I'm saying? But maybe it was just a bad batch.  I had the chicken souvlaki meal and it was pretty good but the potatoes were to lemony for my likeing and the veggies were just meh.

AZ Humane Society Thrift Store is a place to find some really great things at some really low prices.   They have a lot of things, in my opinion even more of a variety then other thrift stores. From books to tv's to dog food to clothes to furniture and much more.  Most of all, I love that when I shop there my money is going to someplace where its really needed.

Just got back from lunch at Switch and I am SUPER happy I decided to go here for my birthday lunch. I had the special that was going on, veggie ravioli, for only $7.95. I would definitely come back for this meal again. It was delicious! The flavor was so good and the meal didn't "weigh" me down like some ravioli dishes. It was light and completely satisfying.  To my surprise my lovely boyfriend phoned in and ordered me a white sangria. It was AMAZING! I would for sure recommend this. Try it, you won't be disappointed!  Another great surprise was that they brought me out a delicious chocolate chip cookie bake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a candle on top with a pair of Happy Birthday glasses and napkin. The desert was to die for!!! I unfortunately couldn't eat the whole thing but I did my best. Thank you Switch for making my solo birthday lunch outing a very memorable experience!!!

Absolutely love the food that Switch has to offer me. I don't think I've ever tried something on the menu that I wasn't absolutely satisfied with. Oh wait, I remember one thing, their martini, but I'm pretty sure I'm just not a martini drinker so that's why I didn't like it.  I love that they have monthly specials and I make an effort to try them out once a month. Their daily $3 drink specials is so awesome!!! The service has always been good to me.  If you haven't checked out Switch yet then you are for sure missing out so get your butt over there and dig in.

Drunken noodles were delish. Loved the lunch special that comes with a free soup and roll. The Thai iced tea was a bit overwhelming with delicious flavor, I had to water it down, but if you love sweet you'll love it full flavor. Lunch time prices were pretty reasonable and service wasn't as friendly as one would want but they were on point. I'll will for sure be back.

I wanted to take my boyfriend to a teppanyaki restaurant since he had never been to one before. This being the closest to us we decided to go here Sunday for our anniversary. It was ok.   The chef we had wasn't very entertaining, he didn't do the egg trick, and his onion volcano was lacking any resemblance to a volcano. Maybe I was just expecting too much. Having been to a couple teppanyaki places before and loved the whole experience.  The food was good but I'd definitely recommend another place for the future.

I just love it. It's a great place that makes you feel right at home. I hate going to gyms, actually I hate working out in front of anyone, but I feel so comfortable here that I don't worry about it. I know that they're just trying to get me to the fitness level that I want to achieve.  Rory, my one on one trainer, is amazing. He seems to know just how much he can push me and how much I can really do even though at times I don't even believe it. The boxing lessons are fun and I love the fact that I'm working out and learning something new.   The 30 minute workouts are just the right amount of time. The prices are fair and reasonable. The owner is just a delight and all the trainers are professional and great.  Glove Game Boxing packs a lot of heat within it's wall. Go check it out when you get a chance. For only $20 you can get a trial session and that to me is a pretty sweet deal.

Been a fan of this building for quite some time.... Seen a fantastic Vine Tavern grow up here. After that came Mckenna's, which was a FAIL. Redemption came with Teakwood's Tavern, as long as you do your homework on which drink specials are avail.  I especially like Friday's special, 2.50 four peaks kiltlifter and 8th st ale.  Food menu is rather nice as well. Awesome decor as well and very comfortable lounge couch's inside and out. and free peanuts just throw them on the ground which is kinda fun ha ha.   If in doubt, check it out!!!

Nice friendly staff. Got in fast. They explained things to me asked about tests before doing them, made me aware of prices before doing anything. Which is amazing and great customer service in my mind. On the initial paper work it even had the doc fee listed. I love when places don't hide prices it's something that shouldn't be a worry when your animal is in need of help.

Disgusting!! I left with a stomach ache and empty wallet.  My boyfriend really wanted to try out Smashburger so I agreed. Boy I wish I would have stuck to my guns and said NO! Boyfriend had the mushroom swiss and said it tasted not so great. I had the Arizonian and the only thing on it that I enjoyed was the guacamole. It was the most awful tasting burger I have ever had. Unless of course you love the taste of grease because that's all the burger tasted like to me. I think their whole gimmick is to "smash" the flavor out of the meat and sop up all the grease flavor.   I tried the Smashfries too and meh. They tasted like frozen shoestring fries thrown in the over. They were not appetizing.  Definitely not a fan and will likely never go back.

I really like any place that allows me to take my dog, the fact that they have a "bark bar" with water bowls and treats makes me love it even more!  The outside is really nice, right next to the canal with easy access to walk the pup dogs. They even have an outside wash area for when you need to wash your hands and can't go inside since you got your animal friend with you.  Bartenders are really awesome, I have yet to find one that is unfriendly. Love the 3 oz samples for only $1. The OHSO salad with chicken was good, pretzels were good, yucca chips with dip (it's guacamole. Which I thought was a little weird that they said dip instead of guacamole) was really good. Something different from corn chips.  I love that they started serving up growlers! I absolutly love that I can go less then 2 miles and get a growler filled with yummy Four Peaks and Oak Creek or any one of there tap selections. I can't wait to try out their brew once it's done!  The fact that it is just a bike ride away makes me wish the cooler days would come even quicker!  I definitely recommend everyone try this place out! You just might see me there ;)

If you're looking to go out, get smashed, waste all your money at the bar and have only a few bucks to get home then Sunrise Cab is for you. The fares are ridiculously cheap and that has made be a loyal customer for ever more.
