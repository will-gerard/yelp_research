Not sure where all that smoke is going but there's not much on the meat! I had the sliders one of each; no go:( All 3 meats dry and not much flavor. (Except when you add sauce) Not that great; but hey, maybe it's an off day for them.

My son and I went to pick up a few parts for our Traxxes Nitro car and truck. WOW! There personal attention was really great  along with helpful knowledge. I ended up buying a new stadium truck as well and I went online in front of them to check their price. To my amazement, it was within literally a few dollars with others. Hats off to you guys @ The Hobby Bench for your attitudes and help. P.S. Your map location is off!

What a great experience! I bought a new Chevy from Antonio Dominguez and he was great. The whole crew was fantastic and made my purchase a peerless experience.

If all good people go to Heaven after death; then all good sportsman go to Cabelas! That's it, right? The only advice I can give anyone here' is to come with a few more bucks in your pocket and an open ended "things to get" list. There is always something on sale and plenty of bargains to go around. I've just recently started buying some of Cabelas name brand items and I haven't been disappointed yet.

Love this place! From the service to the food you won't be disappointed. The portions are always hearty and delicious. I like the Crawfish Étouffée with dirty rice, YUM!

What the SAM HELL happened here? OMG this place is a disaster!! I have eaten here over and over again and although waited; I have never been so dissatisfied in my life. We bring our kids here often and my wife always loves the food. Wow this place screams sucks. I rarely blast a place if you read, but I can't remember when there's nothing to hinge any compliments on. Won't be back!

First off let me start by saying that the last time I had fondue was in the 1970's while my parents where having a canasta card party!  So my wife says, "I have a surprise for Valentines for us"; which always makes me wonder, hum. We end up at the Melting Pot and I think, oh boy, lots of cheese and I haven't had a bathroom break in a day or two! Well, we were a few minutes late for our reservation but the hostess was great and took us right in. We were greeted by our waiter and I immediately found out he knows everything you need to know about cheese, broth, cooking and just about everything in between. So, my wife had set us up for the Valentines package where you get a champagne toast with different choices for appetisers, main dish and desserts.  Well, here's where the fun begins! Let's just say the cheese portion was a small piece of this whole thing.  Mind you I do have a little problem 'boiling my meat' in a pot, but I have to tell you I was surprised!  Everything was fresh and the sauces that were provided to accompany our choices were great.  Needless to say, I was very impressed with the service as well as the food. I say, this place is more than just another CHEESY restaurant! Thanks Melting Pot for a great Valentines Romantic dinner.

I've been hit and miss on coming here simply because of dedication. My wife and kids come literally everyday and always rave about the people and classes; (yoga), as well as her trainer. I have to admit that it's everything she says and more! I tried candle light yoga for the first time and truly enjoyed it. The staff has offered their helpful and friendly advice to guide me through.

God I love this place! Don't get me wrong; Depot has always been my personal Man Cave. But ACE has that little something the others don't. Like whatever that bolt or nut or screw or attachment or fastener or that little whatsyamacallit your needing, yeah you get it! Great customer help that comes with a little small town appeal; yep that's it!

My wife and I make a point to have a Sushi date nite at least once a month. We decided to come here because of our friends recommendations. Boy, we should get new friends! I mean, would a true friend wait to tell you of a great Sushi place? We had a few rolls along with some fresh, (I do mean fresh), fish. I drank my usual unfiltered variety and she indulged in a few Apple martinis. All in all, everyone was friendly and the food better than normal.

Going to the dentist just isn't my way of spending a leisurely afternoon. Here, the staff is friendly and I really have confidence in the Doc. They explain everything well and make you feel comfortable for that not so comfy feeling!

Worst experience I've had at this restaurant. I can deal with higher than average prices; but when I'm treated rudely by the staff I will never come back! Check out my reviews, I rarely if ever give a bad review. Oh, and the owner? No customer skills whatsoever.
