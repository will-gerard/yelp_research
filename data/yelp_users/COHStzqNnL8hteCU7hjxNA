I get my nails done by Jennifer, she always does a great job she is really nice and does exactly what you ask for. Though this is quiet the drive for me it's definitely worth it! I'm so glad my friend told me about this place!

I tried giving td nails a chance, since they are close to me, but they lost a customer. the owner is always being rude and never smiles and the girl who ddoes my nails always did them crooked. I would tell her about it she would go over it with the nail file once and assume it was straight. The guy there is really nice but too bad  not everyone else is like him. This review isn't just about one visit I went to them for about 4 months every other week. Hopefully they improve their customer service and get someone who can do nails properly.

The set up is nice. The service is slow. We ordered Drinks and received them when we were almost finished with our food. The hostess came across upset when I asked her if the misters were on outside. Overall not a pleasant experience. The food was ok I had high expectations for this place, was disappointed. Save your money.

I'm new to this location so I was looking for a new nail salon. This location is just great, they're friendly and do such an excellent job with my nails. I highly recommend them to anyone. They take their time and  make you feel welcomed! This is my new nail spot.

Absolutely fantastic! Angeline is well informed and makes you feel very comfortable. I struggle with adult acne and just from the first visit I can feel and see the difference on my skin. When it comes to her products she is very informative and gives you a routine on how to use each one of them. Her set up is very comfy and homey if I could give her more than 5 stars I would!
