I love Cibo.  Love it love it love it.   The white proscuttio pizza is always a fav, and I can never pass up crepes with banana and Nutella.  Ambiance is great, and the woman who seats us is always a delight.  Perfect place to come when you are on your way to the symphony and don't want to fight through some of the other downtown spots.

Alright, went back last night, felt bad because we were the late nighters, and everything was perfect.  The pizza, the salads and the wine were all so well done.  And what finally brought me to five stars was the crepe with Nuteila and Mascarpone.  OMG amazing.  I'm currently craving it the day after.  Totally beats out the crepe with nutella and banana that I also love...

I've been going to drip now for almost a year now, I love it everything about it.  Gina is always super friendly, and the food is always great.  Free Wi-fi makes it the perfect place for me to wake up in the morning, have a nice breakfast and study in an actually well lit and open coffee shop.  THe only reason I can't give it five stars is I do wish that it would be open past 3 pm, but after 3 I have to head on over to Lux.

I love Chez Nous for the dancing, the live music is always great, but this past Friday I was really disappointed.  The cover charge has been raised to $7, the drinks were weak, and I got charged $9 for a Three Olives and Coke.  Combine that with being cash only so getting hit for $3 at the ATM inside the bar, and after one poor drink I was already at $20.  Maybe it's because I've gone back to being a broke college student, but I found the whole experience disappointing.  It seems like a few articles in the AZ Republic recently and the prices are flying through the roof.  So for now, I think I'm going to take a break from our relationship... sorry Chez Nous

I walk past here everyday on my way to work, and although I haven't eaten there yet, I've been watching them build it for the past few months, and I'm excited to have a new taco joint besides fillib' in the neighborhood. All the people working there are always smiling, and I stopped in for a menu to good conversation.  Can't wait to finally eat there!

I went in again, and it was amazing! I had a carne asada taco, it was perfect.  THe salsa is not too spicy, and super fresh, and the carne asada was done perfect.  The Corn Tortillas were a perfect touch as well.  I just hope everything goes well with the liquor license, I would of loved a coronita!

For the Coronado district, Tuck is the most exciting thing we've seen in quite some time to arrive in the neighborhood.  Walking and driving past it, we've been watching the restaurant being built with lots of anticipation and excitement of what was going to arrive.  So I was really excited to walk by this past Thursday to see it open for business.  I went in just to grab a menu, and instead met the bartender and manager, and enjoyed a great Four Peaks Coronado Ale and got to find out what the place is all about.  The decor of the restaurant is beautiful: There is great art work covering the walls from a Tucson artist that is all for sale, and the mismatched chairs with the quaint reading room off to the side, combined with the wood detail throughout the bar was beautiful.  The bathrooms were even amazingly decorated with the greatest sinks!  Anyways, I went back tonight to finally have a full meal to find a completely packed house.  For only being open a week, I couldn't get over the fact that it seemed like everyone from the neighborhood was there and then some, it was so great to see. But, back to the food- I finally got to try my prosciutto and mac and cheese, and it was amazing!  Followed up with a dirty martini, it was definitely a great meal and experience. My only fear is that it is going to turn into a constant happy hour spot for when I walk past it on the way home from work...

If your looking for some flashy cab ride somewhere, than go elsewhere.  If you are drunk bar hopping, than sunrise is the cab service for you.  From my Bikini to my house, with companies like discount, I was paying $13, with Sunrise, it's never more than $9.  Mix that in with having them take you to other bars in the area, and the difference adds up for sure.  The cabs are sweet 70s-80s Domestics reeking of cigarette smoke, and the cab drivers have all been hilarious and good spirits.  Perfect ride for a cheap night on the town!
