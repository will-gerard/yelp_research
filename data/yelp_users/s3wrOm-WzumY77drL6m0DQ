Cute little breakfast spot. Got a caramel macchiato and a blueberry muffin. The coffee was good, not too sweet, not too strong. A really good cup:)  The muffin was HUGE and so light and fluffy. Will definitely be back again to try some other things. The lunch menu looked really good:)

Love this salon! I now have all my skin care treatments done here too. Caitlan is the best at eyebrow design and waxing! And Megan is the most amazing stylist! So glad to have found this place!

99 cent margaritas during happy hour? Sign me up! Sit in the bar whenever you can, service is much better. Hit and miss in the dining area, I've had a few awful servers here, but the food and drinks are so good I can't stay away! Try the machaca and eggs!

Chicken was dry, veggies & egg rolls were soggy. Go to the one on 67th, it's way better !

This is probably my favorite sandwich shop!  Everything is fresh, made to order. Sandwiches are amazing, pasta is amazing, pastries are amazing, people are amazing. Wish they were open later, I'd eat here way more often!!!   My go to is the Italian stallion!

There are not words to describe the deliciousness of this place! Everything was so fresh, starting with some of the best sangria I've ever had! Our waitress was so amazing. We had never been in before, and even though it was super packed (New Years eve) she walked us through the entire menu and had great tips for everything on the menu! We ordered so much food, just because everything sounded so great, and it all was. I can't wait for the weather to warm up a little more so we can do happy hour on the patio! Even though it's a little far from home, it's always worth the drive! Love love love this place!

My go to Starbucks almost every morning! Everyone is always so friendly and my drinks are always delish! I'm not sure why other reviews say this drive thru is slow, I'm almost always in and out of there, considering it's early morning and hello ... It's Starbucks, everyone loves it so of course it's going to be busy. But in my experience it's always been pretty efficient in the drive thru!

Zero wait time even though the shop was busy! All the girls were very friendly. I got a basic pedi, looks great, lots of colors to choose from. Also got a gel mani, which looks great too! Very clean, will definitely be going back!

First visit here, check in was easy & quick. Didn't wait very long at all in lobby or to be seen by the doctor. He was very friendly, and made my 6 year old feel very comfortable! Hopefully won't need anymore emergency visits, but if we do, we'll definitely be coming back here!

Absolutely love this office! Dr. Cooper is so thorough and genuine! I never feel rushed, he takes the time to answer all my questions, and always makes me feel very well taken care of! His MA is also amazing! Staff is very friendly, no sitting in the waiting room for hours, great follow up and patient care! Would definitely recommend as a family doctor! On a side note, the address listed is a previous location, they are at 67th and Thunderbird now.

I wish I could give 0 stars! This place is absolutely horrible. Took 10 minutes to get someone to take our drink order, and there were only 5 other tables in the entire place. Took another 10 minutes to get our drinks (water), and when we got our appetizers, 15 minutes after that, it was cold. Tried to give it another chance, but will absolutely not ever be going back here. Bummer too, because they have some good concerts coming up!

Got a super cute gel mani here last week! Cute design, tons of colors to choose from. Plus, it's right by my office so I can come in during lunch!

Always quick when I go thru this drive thru. I saw a lot of reviews saying they were slow, but it's never happened to me, thankfully:)  Drinks are always good and they always give my dog a cup of whip:)  Love that there is a drive thru now in this area, although this particular drive thru isn't ideally set up for lots of traffic, but again, I've never been here when it was crazy busy so it hasn't really affected me.   Overall a great Starbucks:)
