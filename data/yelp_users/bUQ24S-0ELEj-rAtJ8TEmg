Love it, love it!  Consistently delicious South and Central American food that you can't get anywhere else in the valley.  It's better than mom's cooking (good thing she's in Miami and won't read this) and defines comfort food!  As already mentioned in other reviews, don't go when you're hungry and wanting to eat right away.  It's a small, family-run business, and everything takes time. The final result, however, is worth the wait.  The Ajiaco is a thick potato and chicken soup, a staple in the cuisine of Bogota in Colombia.  It's delicious and a hearty meal.  The capers and cream are a must- add them in!  The avocado is the perfect side for this dish.  With the cooler weather, this is a must try; but leave some for me please!  The chicken empanadas are to die for- savory chicken in wrapped in pastry.  Add a little lime and you're set to go!  My husband always orders the Bandeja Paisa; another Colombian favorite that could easily feed two, but you'll want your own.  On your plate you'll get steak, chorizo sausage, pork meat with rind, red beans, rice, fried egg, avocado and plaintains; need I say more!    To finish off your meal, order the coconut flan dessert; a delicious combination of custard and coconut in delicate proportions....yum!     Too bad they're closed on Mondays or head over there right now........

What a great place for Sunday Brunch!  The live jazz music and overall atmosphere is so welcoming.  The servers are attentive and friendly.  You can even sit at a bench, enjoy your drink and watch the kitchen staff at work.  So many incredible things coming out of the oven......  The egg sandwich was delicious; the ingredients so fresh!  The house dressing on the salad is amazing. Skip the island punch and order a cinnamon bum; so yummy!  This is definitely a place that's worth going back to again and again.

I started going the salon as a result of Yelp and it's a Yelp success story in my opinion!  The Root has a modern and friendly environment and is a well-run salon.  The stylists take their jobs seriously and genuinely care about making their clients look their best!  They also work really well together.  I was very hesitant about coloring my greys, concerned about my hair losing its natural shine until Emily Claire explained the coloring process and the the fact that she was going to use color without ammonia.   I took a chance, my hair looked great and I was thrilled with the results.    Earlier this year, I was going back home and needed to get my hair done urgently.  Emily Claire was on vacation so I scheduled my appointment with Emily B.  Emily Claire left all my specific information on their database so Emily B., knew exactly where to pick up and did a great job!  The Emilys rock!  I drive 30 miles to get to The Root and it's worth every mile!

To be fair, the first time that I went to The Mission a couple of months ago, it was a 3-star experience.  The food was well prepared and nicely presented.  It could have been 4-stars, but the tacos were sadly small for the price.  Last week's experience was a real let down.  I took my family for a Latin dining experience and was sadly disappointed.  Being an arepa lover, I was excited to partake in the experience with my loved ones.  When we arrived, we were told that arepas were no longer part of the menu, although they were still on the menu :-(  They are now serving the sandwiches that were served on arepas, on the torta bread.  The server was apologetic, but frankly, after driving 40 miles to get this specific menu item and checking the on-line menu before making the trip, I was not happy.  The pabellon filling was very good, but again, a let down without the arepa.  To add insult to injury, when the sandwiches were served, they did not bring Mission fries on the plate, because according to the bus boy, the menu changed when the sandwich was no longer served on the arepa, and it no longer was served with the fries.  The server quickly righted this issue and offered us fries on the house.  There are some high points to the experience: the setting is very pretty and the service is attentive.  The chorizo and papas appetizer is delicious and something worth ordering when you go.

Gabe's five-star rating is well deserved!  We recently had him install a water softener in our house, which due to the house's layout, required complex routing of the drain line through some walls and the ceiling.  Gabe did the work in a professional manner with minimal dry wall repairs needed afterwards.  It was completed on time and for the quoted price.  He definitely knows what he's doing and is a pleasure to work with.  We highly recommend him as a knowledgeable and trustworthy plumber!  The Yelp deal helped with the cost as well!

Great place for a casual dinner! The decor is warm (Thai theme) with comfortable booths and the service is great. There is no long wait to be served your delicious meal.   The menu has a good variety (beef, pork, chicken, fish, seafood) with 4 degrees of heat. The heat is real so be conservative!  I asked for medium/hot and would have been better with just medium. Iced tea helped calm my mouth so np.  You really can't go wrong with anything you order and certainly a go-to place for us.
