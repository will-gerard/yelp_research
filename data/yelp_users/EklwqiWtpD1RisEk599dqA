"The Duck" has been a regular haunt for me as long as I can remember. Even as a child I loved going to the Duck & Decanter. The sandwiches are absolutely delish as well as original. If you're not feeling adventurous though, you can always creat your own favorite. The cheese selection is decent and the cheese plates are always generous. In the wine room, you will find an excellent selection wines and beers, and an always helpful and knowledgeable staff member should you, like myself, need help making a choice. The patio is a wonderful place to spend an afternoon, especially when there is live music and fabulous weather. (Plus dogs are welcome on the patio.) Family owned and operated, the Duck is a valley favorite as well as my favorite!

We have visited other locations and always enjoyed it. Today was a bit of a let down. The high point of the meal was the garlic dip appetizer, the dip was fabulous but it would have been nice to have more than one piece of pita bread to scoop the dip with. My husband had the seared tuna salad, it looked pretty but in the end the flavors were just odd. I had the black bean burger, the actual burger was good but overshadowed by the soggy bread, non dressed salad, mushy flavorless "garlic" potatoes and lack of condiments offered to top the burger. I guess the most disappointing though was the staff, they would make a wet rag seem a sparkling wit. It's really too bad.

Birthday brunch with Mom. Was absolutely fantastic. Toasted with a cava and aperol spritzer. Mom had crab cakes eggs benedict, which I had to beg for a bite of...super yummy. For me (and was even gluten free) the "Matador" two eggs over easy stacked with super crispy tortillas and cheesy potatoes, smothered with salsa verde...delicious!! Service was great, weather was beautiful and even ran into two of my favorite friends. Great experience all around.

Food was great, I had a shrimp taco and a beef taco, glass of Kung Fu girl. Lots of gluten free options. Service was fantastic, super friendly and while they weren't well versed in what was gluten free, they were more than willing to find out. Only complaint is that it was super loud. Too loud. I always feel bad for my dad when the music is that loud because it really messes with his hearing aids, this was too loud for me though as well. We went early, so maybe it was happy hour...turn it down, so I can hang out longer and try more tacos!

Right after I posted my review, someone from the restaurant contacted me. Super professional, apologized for the noisiness, acknowledged it was an issue and thanked me for my review. I don't know why, but that just totally impresses me. Will definitely go back!
