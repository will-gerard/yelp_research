I needed to get my cracked windshield replaced and I did not have insurance coverage.  I took a look at yelp reviews and decided to give these guys a call.  They came out to my workplace and were done in about an hour.  Great and professional service from start to finish.

This place is a pretty efficient and fast machine as far as getting a quick adjustment goes.  Sort of like the fast food drive-thru of chiropractic.  Which I suppose is good for those with limited time and a fast paced life.  I did get some relief from the 2 months of adjustments I paid for.  They lost me as a customer though when they hosed me with their fine print.  I paid for 8 adjustments (a two month plan).  However, I was out of town for a couple weeks and only was able to get 5 of my adjustments done in the two months.  I went in on week 9, they happily performed my 6th adjustment, and then on the way out stopped me and told me that I needed to pay the $29 for today's visit.  I explained I wasn't able to get all 8 adjustments done in the two months, but they stuck to their guns and I not only had to pay for the visit that day, but also lost the two adjustments I had already paid for.  I get it, it was their policy and my fault for not reading the fine print -  however, by them not being reasonable with me as a customer, they lost my business.
