It's my home airport, so it gets brownie points by default..  I've flown in and out of this airport a lot - most recently a trip involving leaving Phoenix for work the day after the super bowl. Even then, good ol' Sky Harbor performs well. It's generally clean, generally efficient, has a decent amount of power supplies for your devices - pretty much anything you can ask for while waiting to catch a flight.  I'm particularly impressed with the local restaurants that have taken up shop in Terminal 4. What better way to either remember or be welcomed to Phoenix by than some delicious local treats!

Charlie's is like my version of Cheers.  Inevitably, I end up here way too often (the check-ins don't lie). It's pretty rare that I don't have a great time, but sometimes weird nights happen.  They seemingly have drink specials any time I'm not there, but even not on special their drinks are stupid affordable. You also seem to get a decent pour for your buck unlike some places around town.   They also host a slew of special events of varying themes and levels of debauchery. Plus, where else can you see drag queens and line dancing all in the same night? Take a lesson from me and be careful with the super happy hour on Sunday afternoons...

My first experience at the Improv was just a couple weeks ago, and to be honest, I don't spend a lot of time in comedy clubs. What I can say is the venue space is decent and the layout was different that I had experienced at other comedy clubs around town in that everyone sat in rows. I thought this was genius because it would make it easier for my server to get to me when I inevitably needed a plethora of booze because I was in a comedy club.  Boy was I wrong - despite the fact there seemed to be more than enough servers available, service was slow and sporadic. And I don't mean like in between comedians sporadic. It made very little sense to me at all - folks sitting down my row got 4-5 cocktails in the time it took me to order and receive a beer. And trust, I was in need of a beer or 12.  Maybe it was an off night (it was a Sunday) but I hope next time I come back for the service to be a little more attentive.

Wow! The myth of Durant's didn't disappoint.  I recently came here for a birthday dinner with my boo. Neither have us had eaten here before. You enter from the back through the kitchen, which at first was a little awkward but in retrospect was kinda neat.  The whole restaurant is like taking a step back in time. Even dressed up by my standards I felt underdressed. I looked around hoping one of the diners was a gangster arranging a deal or something. It's very neat with it's lavish decor and big leathery booths.  I had made a reservation and we were promptly seated. We ordered some drinks, all of which were delicious. My vodka martini was expertly mixed, as one would expect.  Clearly - we ordered steak. We had two cuts - I did the New York Strip (EXCELLENT)! My boo opted for the porterhouse - that's right 48 oz. of beef. Watching him pain through it was worth the price in and of itself (the waitress even helped egg him on by assuring he would be the first member of their "Porterhouse Club" for 2015). So, next time you're in, check out the 2015 plaque on the wall.  The experience was everything I could have hoped for. I can't wait to have a reason to come back!  The only thing I don't get - why isn't Durant's listed as a steakhouse?

Buying my first home, I wasn't really sure what to expect from a home inspector (try saying that 10 times fast).  J Dewey did my inspection at the advice of my realtor, and I couldn't have felt more assured about the home I was purchasing by the time they were done. I was a little apprehensive after choosing a historic home (built in 1925) - as was my inspector Steve Bartolomei. However, we were pleasantly surprised with the results. He walked me through all of his findings and definitely put my mind to ease about the condition of the home I was purchasing which we were both surprised to find, was in really great shape (insert heavy sigh of relief).  I received a comprehensive color report printed on site as well as a full walk through off all the features of the property including, but not limited to water/gas/electric shut offs, weird quirks in the carpentry/electrical work, etc. I found Steve to be very personable and easy to chat with while also being extremely open to answering all of the random questions I could fathom, as well as those being relayed via text from my other half.  Definitely worthy of 5-stars! Thanks again Steve!

Hot damn I love Hanny's!  When I originally moved downtown - this was one of those spots I was uber excited to be near! Let's be honest, $5 vodka martini's all day every day would win me over pretty much anywhere - the fact that they're actually delicious is an added bonus! I also love that they unapologetically (is that even a word) stay open and serve food late every night of the week - a rarity in the downtown area!  Don't get me wrong - their food is top notch as well. If you love salty cured meats the way I do, order anything with prosciutto (or hell - just get some of it by itself on a plate - yum-o!). I've admittedly tasted pretty much every pizza they have and you really can't go wrong. I'm a particular fan of the Martini pizza (I know - shocker) they have on Sunday's and some special weeknights. My bestie swears by their asparagus with fried egg. I also looooove the pork milanese - the onion strings and clarified butter really make it top notch!  Obviously this place is quirky - if you're not familiar with the bathroom situation you're in for a silly treat - I recommend getting that sorted out before having too many martini's. The elevator shaft is pleasantly nauseating. During the holidays they have beautifully bizarre Christmas trees (this past year it was made of martini glasses), and despite the picture of the dolls downstairs, I've never ventured down there because I'm too chicken.  Cheers to staying blissfully drunk and well fed!

Have you tried looking for a periodontist in Phoenix?  Me too.... and if you've had my experience. You know it isn't easy, there's not a ton of information available online, and you really want to make sure you make the right choice.  I came to Dr. K. (trust me, I still can't properly pronounce his last name - something he doesn't seem to mind) at the referral from my dentist. To be honest, I had a consultation for the recession of my gums  on several teeth nearly a year before, and left the other specialist's office with an uneasy feeling that haunted me for some time.  My dentist assured me that Dr. K. and his office staff were a notch above the rest, and I'm glad I took her advice.  I had a consultation and as previously diagnosed - gum grafts were in my future. Starting to feel uneasy again (and made no better by googling gum grafts - which, do yourself a favor and take both mine and Dr. K.'s advice and just.... DON'T) I scheduled my procedure. I had opted for the Alloderm grafts that Dr. K. specializes in (opposed to a more invasive, significantly more painful sounding procedure previously offered to me in another office). Needless to say the next couple of weeks were a countdown to what I was sure to be a horrific experience. Up to this point, I had never had extensive dental work done and my neurosis and anxiety were getting the best of me. Plus, my incessant googling (again... DON'T do it) trying to find some other soul who had a decent experience with the procedure was nowhere in sight.  The big day arrived, and I showed up properly medicated. The expectation was set very clearly I would be spending most of the morning in the office (13 teeth is a lot of work). I head back, put on an eye mask, pop in my headphones to start pumping jams..... and that was about it. Several hours (and one quick bathroom break) later and I was done. The only major discomfort I had throughout the procedure was some sharp pinches when they gave me the numbing medication.... but that was really about it. I was a little dizzy, I assume from the anxiety medication and time in the dental chair, but much to my surprise, the horror I had read about online wasn't what I was experiencing.   I headed home confused as to why this procedure sounded like a scene from a horror movie online, but for me it seemed like a romantic comedy? (ok - kidding here. but seriously, it wasn't nearly as bad as the internet would lead you to blieve it is)   I'm not going to lie and say the entire experience was all unicorns and rainbows (reference above - gum grafts on 13 teeth - clearly there was some swelling and mild discomfort with the stitches), but nothing that wasn't manageable with the medications they provided me. I'm also not a big fan of the soft/easy to eat food diet while having stitches in my mouth... but was made aware there would be some restrictions during the recovery process.  So finally, the big day of removing my stitches came. That lovely Snickers bar I had been lusting over for weeks was finally within my reach. A little extra time in the chair getting the stitches removed and I was done. Believe it or not, I'm not a gum graft expert. But I can say I do notice significant more coverage on the teeth that were worked on, and couldn't be happier with the results.  Of course Dr. K. also performs other miracles, which I can only assume have just as fantastic results. The fact is, throughout the entire process the entire staff went above and beyond my initial expectations of what it was going to be like going through this procedure. Thank you Cynthia for taking my calls with tiny questions and making me feel at ease, and thank you Lory for being a fantastic assistant and keeping me calm through the process as well.  I would without question recommend Dr. K. and his staff is you're needing some work done. They really are a notch above the rest and I am happy to have chosen them for this procedure I had been previously dreading. Thank you for the 5-star experience!

Crescent is one of my favorite places to drop into for all kinds of reasons.... particularly Saturday night dance parties.   Sure it may be a little hip, but to be honest, I think this is exactly the type of thing downtown Phoenix needs more of. It's a great place to grab a drink, catch a show, dance your pants off, meet new people, and generally have a great time without the bougie atmosphere other areas of the valley may offer.  By all means, if you like whiskey and ginger beer - get yourself a HONEY BADGER. They're on happy hour and are generally delicious.  MAJOR PROPS to the CB for expanding their patio areas as well. Most businesses aren't as proactive with stuff like that and would rather just keep a line waiting outside. Last time I was there, the added space was much appreciated.

What's not to love about Dutch Bros.? This is my signature location since it's close to work. The folks here are always friendly and talkative, they play loud house music (which I happen to love) and their coffee / loyalty program is better than the other mega chains (that's right $tarbucks - I'm talking 'bout you!)  Only real gripe is the parking lot / drive thru sitch. It can get pretty backed up; my advice is to take 3 seconds to park and just walk up to the window if the line of cars is too long.

I've been here several times and it continues to impress. The staples combined with rotating items / cocktails are always impressive. I definitely recommend ordering with the tasting options / pricing they provide especially if it's your first time. I generally do the 3 plate tasting and leave plenty full. Some of my favorite dishes include the pork belly, brisket, squid ink risotto, and any ahi or yellowtail Crudo dishes they have. Yum! Oh - and don't be afraid to start with crispy pig ears. At first I was apprehensive but after having them the first time I can't not order them if I'm there :)  The bar has plenty of options for any taste. I recently had a couple of gin drinks which were well mixed, balanced and generally delicious!

What isn't to love about the sky train?! It's free, runs very consistently, and saves me the headache of having to park or Uber to the airport when I travel and take the light rail.  It really is the fastest way (for me) to get in and out of the airport quickly - I can't wait for the expansion to open (that is, if I'm ever not traveling out of terminal 4).  The only grief I have - that's not even worth deducting a star for because it's consistently my fault - is that I'm never able to use the baggage check available at the stop for the train. They have a 2 hour cutoff, and I'm consistently never early. Sigh....

Purple rice?! Whaaaaaaaa?  Harumi Sushi is one of the newer treasures I've come to find in downtown Phoenix. The owner, "Sexy Juno", and his team serve up some of the best sushi I've had in Phoenix thus far.  I personally prefer the Crazy Roll and Sex and the City Roll - but honestly, I can't imagine that anything they serve that you might be eyeing would steer you wrong. And the purple rice..... not sure what it is that makes it so yum-o but it is super delicious.  I also LOVE that this place serves the real-deal-nasal-passage-clearing wasabi on their sushi pieces. If you haven't had the privilege of having the good stuff - and just that pasty green goop they serve at most other places, give it a whirl.... But it's not for the faint at heart (Harumi does have the other stuff too, just in case you're a wimp). Of course, a sake bomb or two could easily solve this problem for you.  The only gripe I have is I wish it was open later. Granted, nothing downtown is really open late enough when it comes to food, so it's not a big issue. But sometimes it would be nice to be able to pop in for a late night fix. I've seen they have some quick grab-n-go options throughout the day. So if you want a late night bite it might be worth grabbing one and popping it in the fridge at home for later.  Keep it up sexy Juno! You and your team rock!

This place is simply wonderful. If you like well crafted cocktails, and aren't timid about paying a little more for a genuine expertly crafted adult beverage, this is your place.  It definitely gets a little on the busier side on Friday and Saturday nights - so be prepared to wait. Unfortunately, there isn't standing room, but this isn't exactly the type of place where you'd want to be standing while chugging down a crappy vodka soda anyways.  I typically go with one of two classics - a vodka martini or an old fashioned. Both are probably of the better variations of those drinks that I've had. The martini I remember being very smooth (which is not always the case if they're using shitty vodka or if it isn't mixed well). The old fashioned is truly a treat. Well mixed without being overly sweet. Perfection!  I'm told they have awesome booze infused cupcakes too - they must be great because every time I'm in they're always sold out!  Places like this are making me really enjoy the downtown revival that's been happening of late. This little speakeasy off the beaten path is definitely worth a stop.  Disclaimer: the positive nature of this review was in no way, shape, or form prompted by the threat of being the disgruntled Yelper of the week on their specials board. Promise.

Stopped in here today for a work lunch. I must admit; I wasn't expecting much. Living downtown, I'm accustomed to the likes of Pomo and Cibo. I must say, however, I was pleasantly surprised! Everyone ordered a pizza - perfectly crispy crusts and fresh toppings all around! I also had a side salad (the bleu) which I will say, for a side, was a generous portion and quite delicious!  I was also impressed by their affordable wine selections (which unfortunately I didn't get to try this go around). They do boast a decent happy hour so perhaps a second visit is in my near future!

Hair. Art. Ms. Pac-Man. What isn't to love?  I came to Palabra because Nicole King - noted yelp celebrity from another mid town salon - moved down here. I was a little taken aback that this yelp celebrity had moved salons. But was willing to go anywhere she was, especially since she was now walking distance from my crib. She's been chopping my hair for over two years and has never let me down. And I can be rather picky when it comes to my hair (sure everyone thinks they're picky about their hair - but I'm talking borderline neurotic here).  The Palabra location doesn't disappoint either. Beyond the creative, energetic and fantastic hair stylists is an art gallery space that I am always intrigued to gaze at while getting a cut. It may not be everyone's aesthetic, but I love the energy of the entire space. Is it possible to feel inspired while getting your hair cut? I think yes!  I'm also told their First Friday parties are a blast!

I hope to all holy hell I never need a DUI or criminal defense attorney; but rest assured, if I do, I won't be calling this joke of an office.  Let's build some context. I'm a relatively law abiding citizen. Believe it or not, I'm convinced I'm probably the only person who's managed to get a jay walking ticket.... downtown..... on First Friday. Sure I've had a couple of speeding tickets, but who isn't in a rush at the wrong time on occasion?  Given my limited infractions with the law, it struck me as quite shocking to come home last night and have an "advertisement" (very plainly labelled on the envelope) from a law firm. Upon opening the envelope, I was in for quite the shock.  After a paragraph of fluff, wishing me well despite the circumstances, the second paragraph of this packet is where things really start to get interesting. "We will cut right to the chase - we know that you were charged with a DUI." Is that a fact, R&R Law Group??? -- because this is the first notification I'm receiving; given my total of 0 arrests.  As you might surmise, this started a bit of panic as I instantly feared that, not only had my identity been compromised; but clearly someone out there was posing as me AND committing crimes.  A quick call to the office just before 6:00 PM and naturally they were already closed (they get one star for listing accurate hours).   So, this morning I had the privilege of calling the City of Scottsdale Police and Scottsdale Courts to launch my own investigation (I had even tried using the Scottsdale Courts website recommended in the letter I received from R&R to look up my "case" - nothing was found..... we'll touch again on this later). Luckily for me, there were no cases or records associated with my name, DOB, or SSN. *phew*  So how could this be? Why did a letter, stating that "The Scottsdale police department releases a list of all those charged with DUI every week. We have sent you this packet because we know we can help." make it's way to me? What help was I needing?!   After my early morning calls to real law authorities, I placed another call to the R&R Law Group. I very plainly state the reason I'm calling, am transferred from a very obvious answering service to a receptionist within the office, and ask her how this can be and try to get some answers. Her response? A dull and dumbfounded "I dunno...."  GREAT! Who can I speak with that may know, I ask? She insists she'll get back with me same day with an answer, takes my number, and voila.....  So it gets to be about 4:55 PM (again, well done in managing to get your hours correct) and wouldn't you know it? NO return message!   I call back, state again my reason for calling, am again transferred from the answering service to the office, and am told there's been no word. Given this is a pretty obvious violation of the State Bar of Arizona's Rules of Professional Conduct (the lawyer initiating the communication is required to divulge their source if requested) I mention it may be worth discussing with them.  LOW AND BEHOLD - I get a call back form one of the R's in R&R Law Group himself. Of course he's profoundly apologetic and sorry that there must have been a misunderstanding (I imagine this is legal jargon for 'I have no idea what happened'). He assures me that this was a result of a service they use to match a mysterious list of DUI violators provided by the City of Scottsdale (recall, that I did search the City of Scottsdale website provided in their own letter which allows you to search by first and last name, and nobody came up -- so this must be legal jargon for 'BS') and reach out to them for help. Much to my surprise as well, he assures me this has never happened before! I couldn't help but wonder if my name was more common like John Smith how many other pieces of bogus legal mail I could be receiving on the regular!   It must have been my lucky day. So lucky I think I'll go buy a lottery ticket!  Call it a mishap. Call it poor vetting. Call it for what it is -- the fact that they neglect any due diligence before sending out these packets of hope and help is laughable. They also apparently feel confident making bold accusations in writing on their own overpriced letterhead that I've committed a crime I haven't, so I'm having a tough time understanding why anyone would trust them with handling legitimate professional legal issues if they can't take2 seconds to ensure they're reaching out to folks with legit issues (and causing someone with chronic anxiety a whole lot of hassle!). I know if I ever find myself in need (even if they manage to get the packet properly addressed to me for something I have done) I won't be reaching out to them.

Decent quality sushi. That comes to you. Constantly and without much waiting.... Need I say more?  I've been a fan of Sushi Station since I started going to the location up at Desert Ridge. Driving down Camelback and seeing this location was now open was music to my ears (sometimes the 30 minute drive up North just doesn't seem worth it).  This location seems more spacious than the other - and included all my go-to favorites (there's one spicy shrimp roll I can't get enough of) as well as some new delights. I especially enjoy getting to try several small bites of different things without it breaking the bank - although I've been known to go a little HAM and eat a few too many plates when hungry. My record so far is ~$36 in plates that don't cost more than ~4 a piece. Care to challenge my mad sushi eating skills?  The one critique I might make - I LOVE yellowtail. And although you can order items not on the conveyor belt that do have yellowtail, they aren't typically included in the standard rotation and finding your waitress can be a little challenging if they're especially busy. Regardless, 4 well deserved stars.

With a growing scene of new places coming to downtown, I'm always stoked to try some place new! I must say, this one didn't hit the mark for me.  My first stop in was on an admittedly beautiful Saturday afternoon. We were there approximately 30 minutes after they opened, and the place was already relatively packed. I gotta admit, I can imagine it being dreadful on a first Friday, an even questioned why they weren't open earlier given the warmer weather we've been having.  My group of friends and I stroll in and decide to order drinks. Given it's newer, we wanted to sample a few of their signature cocktails. EYEROLLS and SIDE EYE and even a few "hurry the eff up" remarks from the bartender were all we were met with...  So maybe she's having a bad day (they've only been open for 30 minutes..... but I'll give her the benefit of the doubt). We order some drinks and she gets to work. Now I didn't watch her make our drinks, nor am I by any means a professional mixologist, but my boo who is experienced in the trade did and she made his drink completely wrong. As in - didn't use a single bottle containing any of the liquors promised in the drink (Midori is a pretty distinct one not listed anywhere on their cocktail menu and his drink was full of it).  So, he says something. And is IMMEDIATELY met with confrontation and irritation from the bartender. She rolls her eyes again, drops a couple dashes of bitters in his drink that it was also missing, and moves on. I'm sorry; but I have very little regard for any place with a signature cocktail list that they then can't manage to mix up properly.  I really, really, REEEEEAAAALLLYYYYYY wanted to like this place. I generally hate video games but loved playing my parents' old Atari as a kid. Mix those games with booze and this should have been a slam dunk! Instead, it felt like I was PacMan getting eaten by an annoying and obnoxious pink ghost. whomp whomp.....
