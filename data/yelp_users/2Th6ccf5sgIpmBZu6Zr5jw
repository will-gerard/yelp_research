I bowl here all the time. It's rarely too crowded, everything is just how a bowling alley should be.   The people are nice and the service is great, except sometimes it's hard to flag down someone for the bar.

There are some people who play magic the gathering (and similar games) who also maintain normal social lives, have girlfriends, and even shower regularly. You won't find any of this type of player among the staff of this shop.   It's hard for new players to get started in magic because there is a stigma about MTG players being rude, unfriendly, not sociable, and generally smelly. Such is my experience from the staff at the shop. And no wonder people don't want to try playing this game.  So let me tell you my story. I've played magic for a long long time (since around urza's saga), but just recently decided to get back into it heavily. A friend of mine and I went to this store to pick up some boosters and whatever, and just check it out because we've heard good things. He is also a brand new player.  I think because I was wearing a collared shirt and was freshly shaven, the staff considered me some kind of menace or outsider, and avoided eye contact, no matter how long I stood at the counter ready to buy something, until I finally asked someone directly to help ring me up. I felt like a guy in a ski mask trying to buy cigarettes.  We came on a thursday, which was draft night, a format my friend and I were not familiar with at the time. HO-BOY was I sorry I asked for information about how draft works. It was such an effort for the guy at the counter (I think he was the owner) to explain it to me. Like I was asking him to do my taxes. He and his unwashed friends or employees (I couldn't tell who actually worked there) also made a couple snarky comments and giggled at my ignorance.   So how the shit are people supposed to learn to play? Don't these people want new opponents? Why must they try and alienate new players? Please, I would like to know.  If you work here, keep this in mind. There are people like me who, unlike you, haven't entirely given up on the opposite sex. That doesn't mean I'm not just as much of a nerd on the inside. Just like you, I'm going to go home after this and play 6-8 hours of video games. I'm going to order pizza because I'm too lazy to cook. I'm going to correct others about Star Wars trivia and wish that Firefly never ended. I'm going to explain to reluctant ears what I think Tom Bombadill represents and how I'm also sad he wasn't in the movies. I'm going to stay up all night writing code.   So can I play magic too? Holy shit. What a bunch of assholes.

I've been here once and had a great experience. The staff was cheerful and seemed very well organized and Dr. Punia is very thoughtful and insightful. Would definitely recommend.

I generally like zipps, but I had this one terrible experience with a waitress at this location, which pretty much defines my experience. I hope she reads this.  I was here after work getting drinks with three friends. (four of us total). I was going to cover the bill for myself and one of my friends, and the two other friends were going to pay their own.   When it was time to go, the waitress came to bring our check. I gave her three cards and said, "I'm paying his and my bill. Can you put 50% on this card, 25% on this card, and 25% on this card?"  She gives me a puzzled look, looks at the cards for a moment, nods like she has it figured out and says, "okay". Then runs off somewhere.   After a couple minutes she comes back to me totally steaming. I can't remember her exact words but they were something like "You can't give me such a complicated order. You need to write down the total for each of you, I can't do this." In her shaky, trying-to-keep-it-under-control voice.    "Sure, no problem," I say. I was annoyed that she didn't just say so up front, but I really wasn't angry at this point.   I did get angry, however, when she came over a second time to give me another lecture about how you're supposed to split the bill. This time, more angry, she says "It's not funny to try and confuse us, we're not rocket scientists like you guys (we were dressed in button up shirts and ties), we sling burgers and fries, its not part of our job to do these kinds of math problems. Next time you ask someone to split a check, you need to write down the amounts, because no waitress is going to do this for you."   My response again, "alright, I understand. It's no big deal, I wrote the amounts for you." She leaves.   COMES BACK A 3RD TIME. "Listen, I'm sorry if I got angry, but you really need to know this is not okay. You can't give a waitress this kind of complicated problem. We sling burgers and fries all day, we're not good at math (she thought the burger and fry thing was clever enough to repeat.)"  I'm not one for conflict, but I finally had to interrupt her with something like  "ALRIGHT. I GET IT. YOU DON'T LIKE MATH. PLEASE STOP TELLING ME ABOUT THIS AND MOVE ON"  TL:DR; Dumb waitress can't do math and got really angry at me when I asked her to split the check in a way I thought was clear and simple.   My friends who are smarter than me suggested I left an equation on the tip line.. I really wish I would have.

This place is the perfect representation of Scottsdale: all appearance and no substance.   The decor is very nice and the service is good (thanks Renee), but the food is just terrible, terrible, terrible. 100% of everything was bad. Wait, I take that back, the smothered tots were delicious, but about the quality of chef boyardee (if he made smothered tots).   So my friend and I sat and each ordered multiple burgers (they have a 3 oz portion). Between us we ordered 5 different burgers and each was INEDIBLE. Seriously, we were hungry guys and we like burgers. We couldn't eat this crap. It wasn't just bad it was gross. For example, both of the ground beef burgers we got were still pink on the inside (and for a tiny 3oz patty you really have to try to cook it rare).   Then, to really illustrate how awful this experience was, I picked up two PB&J's and two grilled cheeses for my vegetarian friends back at the office. They couldn't eat them! They were too gross! It was so bad, that out of 7 entree's, not a single one was good enough to eat!   Oh yeah, and it wasn't cheap either!

I come to this salon for Molly & Michelle. Normally I have Molly and one time she wasn't available so she recommended Michelle, who was also fantastic.   As a guy with medium-long hair, I really have no idea what I'm doing. So I can't go into supercuts or a place like that, because those stylists need so much direction, and I never know what to tell them.   Molly and Michelle consult me, they tell me what looks good and execute on their own opinions.  I'm always really happy with their work, I always come out of there feeling great and happy with my hair. My fiance also likes how my hair looks after a visit. With them I have never had that second-guessing uneasy feeling of "maybe I should go back and ask for a little bit more off the top."   I also want to mention that I've seen a complaint on this page about a living social offer. I just want to comment that those deals are a huge rip-off for hair stylists. The discount comes out of their pocket and only benefits the salon. That's not an excuse for poor customer service, but I think if you come in on one of those deals you shouldn't demand the sun and moon in return, because the stylist loses out on any services you order from them. Just my opinion. If I came in on one of those deals I would feel like the guy who comes into a store 5 mins before closing. Yes, technically you're still in before closing time, but don't expect to get friendly looks from any of the employees.

I just moved here from SD and this is the first place Ive found with the slightest hint of authenticity or originality.  The servers are tastefully rude in a way that is amusing and contributes to the dark atmosphere. Everything inside is dark, old, and antiquely, which together with the black and white gothic portraits an candlestick lighting makes you feel like you're in an alfred hitchcock movie.  The food is outstanding. I had some kind of mexican food pasty and every bite was delicious. If you've never been here and are a fan of anything alternative or outside of the box, I highly recommend you try this restaurant.

Worst hair cut of my life. Person who cut my hair was clearly not experienced. This is worse than when my mom used to cut my hair.
