I came here tonight at 10 pm, and the resteraunt was full of a bunch of panzy, animal like, horizon high school kids. Now I know that sounds mean, but they were literally standing up and yelling, throwing things, screaming across the reateraunt....and not being polite or respectful to other quests. The thing that bothered me the most is that I told multiple waiters to get a manager to ask them to act like humans, and that never happend!!! The food was good, and our waitress was sweet...but management needs some help, if they are allowing this behavior. I was informed by multiple employees that these kids come every Friday night so I would avoid this location!!! I Won't Come Back, I Don't Have Enough BOTTLES Of advil To Handle That, nor do I Have the patience.

This is definitely a go to date night for me And my bf. We absolutely love the beachy/surfy/laidback enviornment! The server we love is named eugine I beleive. Hes very kind! I'm a picky eater and love substituting things. I usually get the "Rincon burger" which they took off the menu and substitute for Turkey. He had no idea what it was but was willing to go ask someone if I could still order it,  and he also reccomended other new options! He handled my pickiness very well, and genuinely cared about serving us and making us happy! I also appreciate that he treated my bf well, (guy waiters can tend to talk to the women more) but he almost acted as of they were friends! I love great customer service! We are always there because the food is great, but we def found our new favorite waiter!  I'd recommend this place to everybody!

Dr. Rouhani and his whole team are absolutely as good as it gets! He is such a skilled, personable, and all around great dentist! Kim, the dental hygienist is also soooo amazing! She's the only one I'd ever trust to do my cleanings! She as Well,  is so personable and takes great care while Working on my teeth. I never thought id say this before finding this practice, BUT I love going to the dentist (this one only of course )!  I always walk out feeling fabulous about my smile! I can trust Dr. Rouhani, Kim, and the team. Everyone that is apart of his practice is so genuine and talented, so if you are looking for a reliable dentist...check out amile concepts!

I have never reviewed a department store before, but figured I definitely should for this one!! I'll start off with, the customer service was AMAZING!!! The lady who checked me out was so funny, and positive, and pleasent to be around (this is hard for retail workers, especially around the holiday season! ), so that was great! This store is also good as far as stock goes, I feel like I always walk out with everything I went in there needing, and usually more!! This store also has great deals going,  all the time. They always honor your coupon if you accidentally leave it at home, or have some kind of alternative! I would recommend shopping here and giving it a shot :)

I love golds! I see some reveiws below about "old equipment", and yes it is older but its always working! And the monthly rate is only 10-20 dollars a  month, its so affordable! They have any machine you could want or need, there is a womens room for people who want the privacy and there are men and women locker rooms with a sauna! I'd say I definitely get more than I pay :) its a great deal! And gerry trains my friend and she's lost so much weight!

This Whole foods location is the absolute best! Love the vibe of the store,  and the set up! The selections are great, The employees are great, the food bar is GREAT.  I love coming to whole foods for lunch.  The food is always fresh, delicious,  and ready to eat. The mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts are phenomenal. And you can always have confidence knowing that your eating whole, organic, and fresh food.  Ill always do my shopping here :)

It was our first time at sandbar, me and a friend got the jalepeno mac n cheese. And my boyfriend got the calamari. The jalepeno mac was missing the cheese and jalepeno...it was tateless. And my bf had a hair in his calamari! The waitress we had seemed to have an attitude, and when I told her it was our first time here she didn't even explain the menu. I don't think she even introduced herself. The only reason I gave this place two stars is because the manager was very sweet and gave my bf a new plate of calamari and took it off our bill. She was very apologetic! Other than that, my experience was not great and I would rate it less.

Love this place! I usually go to a place in scottsdale, but they were bought out as jeniza nails, and their new management sucks. I was looking for a new place that's a little cheaper but still nice! THIS IS IT. My experience started off a little rocky with some miscommunication on pricing, it was only off by a few bucks but the manager was persistent on arguing with me. I asked her to just drop it  and that I didnt mind paying more, and she did. I just thought her attitude came off a but strong and unprofessional in the beggining (I work in a salon, and I feel like customer service is always #1.) . Other than that, the place seems to be great. Its very spacious and clean, and they offer you water right away! The guy who did my nails (forgot to catch his name) did a FANTASTIC job. I got a fill, gel polish, and a design for only $30! He had such a steady hand, and was so polite and sweet through out the whole service. He was new, and his nerves didnt show through at all! Very confident guy...and his customer service was on point. I love love love my nails, and definitely will be returning to him.
