If this had a lower rating then one star I would have given it that rating this place has horrible customer service the people that work in there are not knowledgable and are idiots at best . If you are reading this now please take my words of advice go some where else that wants your business .

This place has the best BBQ in Arizona I'm a born and raised native and I can say this with confidence. This was a spiritual experience of me throwing utensils aside and diving into my plate cave man status . Would recommend pulled pork ribs n the brisket oh my god !!!!
