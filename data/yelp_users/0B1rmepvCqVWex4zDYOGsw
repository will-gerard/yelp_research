LOVE! I have been going to Flesh Creations for 3 years now and never will I go to another shop again. Probably one of the cleanest, organized, reasonably priced, and friendliest shop I have been too. They are always running great specials on tattoos and piercings and have regular tattoo parties ($40 tattoos). Duane has done 5 of my tattoos, a cover up and a handful of piercings for me & Taija has done a cover up for me as well. They are the best and Flesh Creations has definitely become my home away from home!

RIPPING PEOPLE OFF!  Cartwheel has an awesome offer for 50% off ham so we head to Target to get a ham at a great price.   We grab a ham priced at $29.66. We get in line and I'm thinking that's a little pricey for a ham. So I go to look at the tag and see how many pounds it is and if it's even worth getting one. There was no weight listed on the sticker. But notice writing under the sticker so we pull the sticker up, to find the original price tag for $16.71.   Had I paid 50% of the $29.66 then ham would have been $14.83. That's only 13% off the original price of the ham.   So knowing there was a Target Cartwheel coupon for 50% off, they purposely up the price of the ham. Which really doesn't give anyone a deal. Ripping off people in the West Valley at its finest.  Needless to say we made them honor the $16.71 price, so after my cartwheel coupon $8.35. Plus my Red Card and family discount down to $6.09 for their $30 ham!

Very addicting! Fresh, moist, awesome flavor combinations. Nice, friendly, helpful staff. Hidden gem of Avondale. If you still say Sprinkles is the best you've never been here! Very disappointed in my self for living less than a mile for close to a year and not knowing about them. But maybe for the best or I'd weigh about 200+ lol.

Been looking for a good gyros close to home for awhile. Hit the spot!! Better than Gyro Express in my opinion and the manager is amazing!

Duane & Taija are amazing. I have been going to them for 5 years and would never stray. They run a very clean and professional shop, have great talent and surround themselves with great talent as well. Also very personable, fun, open people to be around, which I appreciate greatly. Not like other shops I've been to with some what rude and short artists.     Duane pretty much owns my arms and I can't wait to go back and get them finished!

Great bar. Close to work. Awesome happy hour! & Amy is by far one of the best bartenders I've came across.

I am not a burger fan, I repeat NOT a burger fan. But I will definitely go back for another. Also I'm very picky about sweet potato fries and I stole a couple of my mom's and they were great! Very fresh. The house made Whiskey BBQ is amazing. Love they server beer in a mason jar! (Country girl at heart). Our server was great, he actually got my son to eat by bribing him with Jelly Beans. Can't remember his name unfortunately =/

I must admit. Disappointed. I had been anticipating going after driving by almost daily seeing the parking lot always packed. The lines didn't bother me. The wait didn't bother me. The atmosphere was pretty cool.   But the food? Plain. I can easily say we probably ordered every thing on the menu between our group and nothing stood out. I should be able to eat without drowning it in sauce. And then unfortunately their signature sauce wasn't all that great either...  And seriously? Just a plain old loaf of bread?   I ate it. Will I go back? Most likely not. Especially if I'm the one paying.
