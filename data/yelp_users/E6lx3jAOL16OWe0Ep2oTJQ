Every Monday is either a dollar or a penny plus skate rental, so I spend my Monday nights here with my husband and best friend. The people that work here are friendly and so are the skaters that have more skill in one toe than my entire body. ;) Holidays kinda suck because there is always a million people, but I love it here!!

I was SO excited to go here... One of my clients wanted to thank me for the work we accomplished together and so she treated me to High Tea. I dressed up for the occasion and when we walked up I noticed the sign next to the door announcing the soup and scone and salad (I think?) of the day. It was listed as a walnut scone and since I am HIGHLY allergic I told our server as soon as we were seated that I would need whatever the alternative was due to my allergy.  There was no nut free alternative. And on top of that she scolded me like a child for not saying something at the time of the reservation. My client had no clue of my allergy and could not have known. THEN our tray of goodies were brought out and she pointed out everything on the trays that had nuts in it. (Probably close to 75% of the tray was nutty). She half heartedly apologized that there was nothing they could do and that I would have to pick around my allergens. In today's day I am stunned that they are so callous towards such a common issue, and that they couldn't have been bothered to even make me some sandwiches on a different bread so I could enjoy a little more than half a sandwich and some fruit.  The tea wad lovely, and the decor was perfect for a tea house, but their total lack of regard was awful. If I had gone on my own I would have demanded a refund and made a but of a scene. As it stands I think I'm going to be letting the health department know about this place....

I went here last weekend with my visiting sister and my BFF, and had a blast. The blue dragon drink thingy was delicious, the spicy wings have flavor not just burn and there was a pool table. I dug the band, but I'm a bit biased since I know them, but I usually make a point to see 'em if they're playing when I get a night out if that means anything... All in all, I'm a fan

I was hurting  yesterday and almost cancelled a day of work I felt so awful. I found The Joint by fate and coming here I got one of the most detailed exam and best adjustment ever. I will be back!!

I went to Dana for my son's first haircut and she did wonderful!! My son had a blast and she was able to give him a beautiful cut, even though he was squirming. She will always cut my son's hair! :)

$5 large pizza that ISN'T Little Caesars? I'm already a fan. Add the fact that they flavor the crusts and offer bomb wings AND breadsticks? I'm sold. Delivery is slow, but what do you expect when it's good food on the cheap coming to your doorstep? Well worth the wait.

I love CJ's, some of the better quality fast food around, but this place is AWFUL. Always out of apple slices, and half the staff INSISTS there is no such thing as a large order of onion rings. I am consistently dissatisfied here, but unless I feel like driving all the way to Fiesta Mall I'm stuck going here. I'm giving it 2 stars because even though the people that work here are dumb as bricks, they are usually really friendly.

I have seen A LOT of chiropractors in my life, and experienced pretty much any type of adjustment out there, but my best experience by far has been with Dr. Llaca. She is knowledgeable and does adjustments based on your physical needs NOT a cookie cutter adjustment that she gives to everyone who walks in the door.  If you want to feel better, AND have your opinion respected by a doctor, Dr. Llaca is your chiropractor.

Marcus is a great guitar instructor here! He is patient and works well with children, as well as has real life music experience to share with the students. My son is always excited to go see him and find out something new from his lessons. I think he recently let my son hear some of his original work that blew my son's mind.
