Service was extremely slow. We made a reservation for 6 and they set aside 1 table for 2, so we had to wait for another one to open. Reservation was at 7, we were seated at 8. Waitress was nice, but didn't come around much. Food was super fishy tasting (even the rice). Orange chicken was good and so was the rose margarita. My friends liked the sushi.

Small diner with cute decor. My niece got a HUGE waffle, yet when my. $9 Belgian waffle came out, it was nothing more than 2 Eggo waffles. When we brought it up to the waiter, he got an attitude with us, and said "That's not an eggo, it's a waffle!" and walkedc away. Be then went back to the cook and said "they have an issue with the waffle." My waffle also came with a bowl is strawberries. All good, except that the strawberries were obviously not washed before they were swerved. Needless to say, I won't be coming back.

I love Olive Garden! The food is always wonderful and the staff is always so nice! Only downside: I eat WAY too much! Lol

Jay Jay is AWESOME!!! We're a giant crew (10) and she was able to handle all of our rapid- fire questions and needs. She was super fun and very helpful.

LOVE Lish!! This is the best nail place I have found. Everyone there is super nice and caring, and they work together to make sure you have the best experience possible. They do wonderful manis, pedis, full sets, and waxes. I will never go anywhere else!

Great food, good prices, DELICIOUS sweet tea. I've had both the turkey sandwich and the Italian sandwich and both were very flavorful. They don't skimp on the meat or toppings, and their sides are good sized as well. My parents love the muffaletta.
