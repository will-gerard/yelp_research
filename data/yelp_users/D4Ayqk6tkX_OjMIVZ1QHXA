Let me tell you what these guys did for me. I crashed my car a while back and called them for a estimate. An actual technician house to give me a visual estimate on the car. It was basically estimated as more to repair than the car was worth, and the technician was very honest about that. He asked me what I planned to do, and I mentioned I had put it up on craigslist for $2.5k. He said that he heard of roughly the same car in the same condition going for $3-3.5k, and that I was selling it short. He also sent me the official estimate anyways, just in case.  Sure enough, I put it up for $3.5k and sold it in a week, for $1000 more than I would have otherwise. Bell Collision didn't get my business that day, but when the time comes I can't imagine going anyplace else. You guys rock.

I've eaten at this place for football games or just some great wings many a time in the last two years. Been here probably 40+ times with big and small groups and almost always had a great experience.   The inside is clean, the patio has a great view, there's tons of TVs with every conceivable game on at every angle you could look at, and they sometimes even throw my Browns up on the big screens, which is nice. I usually order the TK Signature Sauce wings for a great sweet/spicy mix, and they've always got a decent beer selection with great seasonals to wash it down with.  Kelly, our server last time, was prompt, hilarious, and kept us supplied with wings and alcohol to our heart's content, and even talked Star Wars with us during half-time. It's great to have servers that add the personal touch like that.  Look, it's not the Ritz Carlton. It's a sports bar with a bunch of ladies trying to get through college running around and serving food and beer in not much clothing. I think the place is perfect for what it is: a great unsophisticated way to kill a Sunday.  Four stars though because I suppose it's just a tad expensive for bar food. Anyone whining about parking apparently doesn't know that A) there's a giant garage underneath their feet and B) they're happy to validate it.

I live within spitting distance of this place and I love it. It's just a great place to come, drink some strange beer, eat some unique food and chat. The staff is always extremely competent and knowledgeable about beer, though they don't small-talk much as the place is almost always packed! The owners are consistently there working along side their staff, and they take a lot of time to speak with regulars and make sure the service is on-point. The husband/wife team run a tight ship and their love of this business definitely shines through.   If you ask me, the only problem with the place is that the inside chairs are pretty uncomfortable, but I usually sit at the bar so it doesn't really matter.   This is the type of business that helps a city grow and gain character. A beautiful, clean, professional place with good service at a great price. I'll always be coming back.

I can't say anything better than has already said by other people. Carter is an honest, competent mechanic with excellent pricing and a great personality. He worked on my awful, piece of crap vehicle and he got it all done in 3 hours. As much as I hope my car always runs perfectly, I'm not going to dread it breaking like I used to knowing I can call Carter to help me out.   Seriously. This guy's fantastic.

Alright, let's talk about the good. These places are great for location. The floor plans are spacious. High ceilings, great sound insulation between apartments and floors, a beautiful pool, prompt maintenance staff. A nice garage as well. I lived here for 2 years and chose to keep my exceptionally expensive apartment through 2 bouts of unemployment and now working at a job that's left me with half the income I was used to because I like the place so much.  So let's talk about the bad. The windows don't insulate much noise from the street. At all. I woke up to bus sounds many a morning before the sun rose. The elevators are constantly broken. Got groceries, or parking is full on your floor? You're out of luck. Someone above me drilled holes in their concrete wall for hours at a time. Might have been staff, might have been some insane occupant. It definitely never went away though and happened at odd hours. The apartments all have huge windows that ruin the insulation of the place during the summer. I was paying $350 electric bills in the summer with my thermostat set at 78 (and turned off when I went to work). They also have a 'concierge' trash service you can't opt out of. I used it once in 2 years. Their water utility is like, twice as expensive as any I've ever paid. I had three guys living in a house and I'm paying $25. Now I've got a single roommate and I'm paying $50+? Never found out what was going on there.   But now let's talk about the ugly. My apartment floor plan went on the market at $1925. I chose the unit I'm in because this particular one had sat empty for 3 months. It doesn't have the best view, it's right above hobo-fight bus stop, but for $1625 it was what I wanted at a good price. Back what I was making 80k. Now I'm making 40k, still a decent living, but after pet rent, utilities, and their add-ons, my monthly expenses for owning this place are more like $2100 off of a $1625 rent. I gotta cut costs. So I call up the staff. "Hey, I see my current, exact apartment (#308) is on the market for $1777 on your website. If you can get me that price and kick in my concessions, or even part of them, I can 100% keep this place. You guys don't have to find a new tenant, it won't sit empty, it's win-win, right?"  Well, I was wrong. To stay they actually want to increase my rent by $50 dollars. They also inform me that they've not been charging me for my 2nd cat (I paid the 2nd pet deposit for damn sure, so I think they just had a clerical error they never fixed they were trying to turn in their favor).  When I asked them why they couldn't drop my rent so I could stay in my home, I was answered with this line, verbatim.   "Rent only goes up. Rent never goes down."  Oh. Well. Maybe I'm stupid. Maybe I'm missing something. So I get off work a little early and I go to the front office. "Explain this to me." I ask. So they do. They explain that even though my apartment is worth less on the market now according to their website, since occupancy rates are high, they do not care for my issues or my loyalty. Which I guess is their right. They run the apartment, not me. I also quote "It's just the way it is. Do not take it personally."   Well that's okay. Don't take the 1 star review personally, then.   If you want to live in a extremely pleasant business transaction, this is a pricey but decent option. If you want to find a HOME? A place where you feel welcome? Look somewhere else.

Just to let everyone know what happened, their customer support rep called me once, we had a very nice and constructive conversation, and they told me they'd get back to me with either good or bad news.  I never heard back. So. The one star stays relevant.
