I agree with the other reviewers. I came in for a mole check and they ended up removing 3 moles  They didn't inform me how much it would be to remove them. I told her my insurance isn't great and I was worried about the cost. I ended up paying almost $1,000 for everything which is ridiculous and now have three ugly scars. I've been going to  dermatologists for years and this is the first dr who removed this many moles. It's definitely about getting your $ at this place.

I really enjoyed working with Amerizona. They came to our house to give us an estimate. They were very friendly, knowledgable, and answered our questions. Once we decided to order the sunscreens they came out the next day to measure. The service guy was by quick. Originally they quoted us 3 weeks to get everything done, but they were so amazing the screens were installed the following week! The screens look beautiful and I've already noticed a difference in the temperature of our house (since its been hot already!) I'm so glad I used them!

Not impressed. This office is very unorganized and blamed my drs office for not sending info when I confirmed before my appt it was received.   Every time I see the ANP she spends about a minute with me tells me I need to up my dose and that it's weird my dose is so high. I feels like that episode of scrubs where they time JDs visit to show they are only with the patient for 30 seconds.   Check with your insurance before getting a sonogram here. The cost at their office was double the cost of an outside provider. They will suggest getting it there but make sure you are informed of the cost. It's not a pretty bill.   Also, they make you come in after blood work and will not tell you over the phone if your medicine needs to be changed. I've had thyroid issues for years and my past drs would tell me over the phone. Here I have to pay for lab work, a 1 minute office visit and take time off from work. My boss really loves me.   I've seen dr Rudgear as well and wasn't impressed. She never checked my chart before coming in and I always had to explain to her what happened at the last visit. Isn't that why you have charts? Then before my biopsy, while doing the sonogram, she thought we probably didn't need to do it bc of the size. She still did the procedure but said we probably wouldn't get results bc of a small sample which was the end result. So I paid over $1,000 for nothing. So I'll be eating ramen soup for awhile while I pay my bill.  Take the advice of the reviewers on yelp and google and go somewhere where they care about your health and not just the money. Also, once you think your bill is paid in full you will continue to receive bills. They will tack on a late fee if you are one day late. Look closely at your bill. They were kind once and waived it once for me.

Being new in town we've been looking for a mechanic to repair my husbands jeep. I called Joel and he answered right away, explained his process and said he'd keep me informed before he made any repairs. When he found the problems he gave me a quote and walked me through everything. He quickly fixed the car to get it back up and running.  Joel is very detailed and honest. I will definitely bring our car there again.

I moved here a little over a yr ago and have been looking for a salon. My stylist was Cali and she was amazing. She took time to listen, give ideas, and with the cut. I liked that she was honest and gave suggestions on taking care of my hair. The prices are great too!  I'm so happy I found this salon and can't wait to go back!

Humble monkey is an amazing place for yoga. The teachers get to know your name and your injuries. This is one of the first studios that took the time to correct postures that I've been doing wrong for years! Monday night Flow is one of my favorites. Also, I like that the teachers take time to tell personal stories and set an intention before the class. It's a great small studio that takes yoga seriously!
