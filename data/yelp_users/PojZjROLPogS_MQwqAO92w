This was the closest Chinese food place to us and after getting the mongolian beef lunch meal and  a side of pot stickers I will make the drive to get better food. It is over priced and seems more like a fast food place and not an actual restaurant. The menu said the lunch special came with egg fried rice. It was not fried rice and the mongolian beef was the worst I have ever tasted. The pot stickers weren't bad, but they were fried instead of cooked/steamed on a pan like they should be cooked.

Had the worst experience here on Sept 28th. Ordered our food and waited and waited. My husband had to go look for it. He came back with our tray and everything was cold. I had to talk with the bartender twice before she said she would get a manager. She never did. I had to come back inside and ask the other bartender to get the manager. Her only excuse was that the girl was new. I was supposed to get a refund and I was told that it would show up as a separate transaction. Still haven't seen a refund and haven't had a response back from any of my messages or emails.

I'm not a pizza eater, but when I get a craving this is where I go. I love the flavored crust and the deals. Pizza is always delivered early and the drivers are nice.

I had a half order of biscuits and gravy with bacon and an egg. It was delicious! I cleaned my plate! I also tried my son's piggy omelet which was stuffed with meat!  We will be back again.

Amazing family owned company! I haven't had my ac unit serviced in the 4 years that we have owned it because our builder said it could void the warranty (a total lie). I also stopped using my ac as much because my bill just skyrocketed when I did. I talked to Jamie about having it looked at and she scheduled Robert to come out. He did a fantastic job and spent the time to educate me about proper ac maintenance and also setting up my controls upstairs and downstairs for maximum efficiency. I have had my ac on for the last few weeks and my electric bill has only increased by $5.00 so far! I haven't turned on my ac this early in the year in the last 2 years! Thank you for making my home a "cool" place to be!

Michael went above and beyond to locate the correct key for my file cabinet. He did the research and found where to special order it from and took care of everything! Customer service was well above my expectations! Everyone should use him!

New owners are great- greeting everyone that comes in and making you feel welcomed. You can tell that the food is homemade and everything we had tasted good!

Pho was very good- the broth has a lot of flavor and it's the perfect amount of food. We also got the beef chow fun - my favorite so far! I have been searching for good Vietnamese food since I moved from California. This place is great and exceeded my expectations!
