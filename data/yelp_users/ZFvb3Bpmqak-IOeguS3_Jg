One star only because it won't let me use 0. This place is a joke...they charge you more if you look like you have $. They also slap acrylic over your whole nail with a big brush...cuticle and all...they shape it and when it's dry try to rip it off your skin with a file and then get irritated when you pull away due to the pain...If you are looking for a great nail spa check out Pro Nail and spa by Tina at 67th Ave and 101...infinity doesn't even clean their implements...The bloody file they used on the last client is now being used on you...

I drive by here everyday, and today my husband and I stopped in for dinner. We ordered an appetizer special, and two pizzas.. I just have to say this is the best pizza I have ever had. we are both Italian, and this is authentic. The staff is so friendly also. definitely a hidden gem!! We will be back soon.

I came here for the first time tonight, and I am very impressed. It's a great spot to have coffee with friends, or work on school work. The only downfall is after dark the lighting is extremely dim which makes studying difficult. We walked through all of the rooms looking for brighter light but couldn't find any. Hopefully they will increase the lighting if they want to cater to students pulling all nighters. Other than that, I think it is a great spot. We will most likely not take advantage of them 24 hours because of the dim lighting.
