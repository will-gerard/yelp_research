If you could imagine going over to your friend's place for dinner if your friend is a chef?  That is the Welcome Diner.  Every time I have been there, the place was full of laughter and the smell of great food cooking.  If you sit at the counter, you could smack the chef on the ass.  Order a hurricane, and everyone in the joint yells, "HURRICANE!"    It is a great time.  My only complaint?  They aren't open enough hours to totally clog my arteries.

Walked in somehow thinking the place served BBQ.  *Wrong* I had the special... 4 tacos for $5 bucks.  The gal behind the counter took my order, and brought the drinks to the table, along with a couple of servings if the very best pinto beans my Texas bred behind has ever eaten.  The tacos were amazing, the place was military clean, and the service could only have been friendlier if a Labrador puppy wrote up my order.    Can't wait to go back.

We descended on Four Peaks for a reunion with friends who moved to Atlanta a few years ago.  I think the original reservation we had was for about 20 people.  The group continued to grow and until we were about 40 deep.  Through it all, our server, Jessica, got drink and food orders in and out of the kitchen and bar with incredible speed.  As our group grew, tables magically appeared so folks could sit down and order.  She struck the perfect balance of being helpful but unobtrusive.    Not one complaint about food, and no one had to wait for a drink.  Jessica did it all with a smile, and I really appreciate her hustle and effort.  Four Peaks has a great system for customer service, amazing beer, and pretty good food.  I will be back, and hope to see Jessica as a leader when I do.

Barrio does not take reservations.  I was a little apprehensive about throwing a surprise birthday party there.  We showed up, announced I needed seating for eight at 6:30... and was seated about 90 seconds later.    What do you say about the food?  Not sure how it could improve.  Best guac (I hate guacamole) on the planet.  My foodie guests were delighted.    We will be back.

Mac and Cheese with bacon tasted like nothing but onions.  The shrimp cocktail had freezer burned shrimp.  Indifferent service.  Server didn't even know we'd sent the shrimp cocktail back.    A poor dining experience.

It is hard to isolate the single worst thing about Hob Nobs.  Is it the shabby management?  The filthy cook?  Or the hipster emo counter staff?  Amber, who took our order clearly thinks customer service is beneath her.  We ordered cesar salads and a sandwich.  The salads were served fairly quickly by a cook who's uniform was clearly encrusted with a week's worth of food debris.  Gross... but where the hell is my sandwich?  After 17 minutes of waiting for the sandwich, I asked the soccer mom behind the counter, to which she replied, "Hon, they take a few minutes."  After another five minutes, I got pissed.  It is a sandwich.  Nobody asked them to make a rack of lamb.  Bread, meat, cheese, garnish, and a few condiments.  Pretty basic stuff, right?    When I finally complained to the bald guy in the bad Hawaiian shirt who apparently runs the place, he simply said, "sorry" and made the sandwich in front of me.  Amber, the emo counter girl, started to complain to me that they were busy and someone had  called off.  Bad Hawaiian shirt guy sent her out to smoke.  I watched through the window as she commiserated with filthy cook guy, and then returned to work without bothering to wash her hands.  Gross again.  I would eat daily at the Phoenix Rescue Mission before setting foot in Hob Nobs again.  At least there the staff is nice, and want to help.

First, the pizza was great.  Probably in the top three I've had in Phoenix.  Second, the delivery got screwed up.  Third, when I called in, Christine the manager SWIFTLY took care of the issue and made me fully satisfied.  It was obvious that she is a professional, and has high standards for customer service.  I'll order from them again.

Matthew Gallego is one of the best barbers I have ever been to.  I love the memorabilia in his shop, his professional demeanor, and his hospitality.

A very cool use of space, and a staff that makes you feel like you are coming over to a friend's house for breakfast.  Except that you have to pay.  The smoked pork chop is amazing.  I'd have eaten two of them, no problem.  The waffle was a little wimpy, but everything else was perfect.  I'm going back to try the Japanese cold brewed coffee later.  They gave me a sample before they even opened, and I'm probably hooked.

After months of eating at Vovomeena, I'm not sure why I shop for groceries any more.  My only complaint?  I wish they were open later.

I would really have to nitpick to find much to kvetch about at Angel's Trumpet.  In full disclosure, I know and like Matt, the owner.  My biggest complaint is that the place is not open for lunch.  I was stunned when I suggested the place for lunch, only to find they open late.  The other night, I had three beer snobs out for drinks and dinner.  As always, the beer was fantastic, and the quality of the food has become consistently excellent.  The real star was our server, Chelsea.  Pretty, funny, and prompt without being obtrusive.  She had a ton of tables, and literally ran herself glistening making sure that everyone was taken care of on a hot summer night.

I am very surprised.  It is huge, clean, and very well stocked.  Was everything perfect?  No!  It is a buffet!  You don't pay $7.99 to eat at the French Laundry.    For sheer volume?  This is probably as good as it gets in Phoenix.

Oh... Taco Guild.    I bitterly resent having to give you a single star.  Pretty much everything is a disaster... from high-top stools designed by Torquemada, to the brazenly over priced drinks fetched by surly independently wealthy cocktail servers.  Our server looked like a lumberjack, yet acted like Serge from Beverly Hills Cop.    I had two tacos, "torn lettuce cups."  What I got was half a head of wet butter lettuce with a neat tablespoon of sodium soaked protein in the middle.  The pork adobo was indistinguishable from the coffee braised brisket.  Truly stunning for $3.95 EACH.  I have eaten more satisfying fare out of an MRE packet.    It is loud inside, which amplifies the horrific choice to put a jukebox in a restaurant.  There is a ton of service staff, none of which will make eye contact with a patron begging for a drink.    The chips were fresh and crunchy, and the salsas offered were not bad.  Perhaps that merits the single star I was forced to give.

The brisket is on point. The mac and cheese is the last thing I want to eat before I die.   Can't wait to go back for the beef ribs.   Service is polite and folksy. I found the prices to be a little under the going rate for BBQ.
