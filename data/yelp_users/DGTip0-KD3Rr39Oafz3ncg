My 4 star rating is based off of my usual order, which is the Chicken Caesar Wrap (not to be confused with the chicken caesar PITA - you wanna get the WRAP because they use the thin lavash bread.)  I always get dressing on the side, although their caesar dressing tends to be lighter than most I've had anywhere else.    Please do yourself a favor and order this if you have never had it.  And eat it when it's hot - the perfectly thin lavash bread is crispy and chewy and I promise you they do not skimp out on the ingredients - the inside is brimming with perfectly grilled chicken breast, lettuce and croutons.    They also have wheat lavash if you're trying to be all like, healthy and stuff.   And the girls who are usually at the counter are always sweet and gracious.  As if the hot az weather + lunch traffic doesn't make me want to punch babies already... it's just a nice change :)

I've never had a bad experience here as far as customer service goes - I'm usually just in and out since I know what I want. I just grab it and pay for it.  However, my low rating is based on what I experienced here recently.    I attended a wedding this past weekend and decided I was too lazy to do my own makeup and being in a hurry, I just felt like having someone professional do it so that I look extra nice, since it is a wedding.  And what a coincidence that MAC does your makeup for free with a $50 dollar purchase, and I needed to grab some items anyway.    I arrived 15 minutes before my appointment, at 2:45 pm.  I was greeted really nicely and was told my artist had just arrived.  Very shortly after my artist walked over and greeted me and told me sit in one of the chairs.  She then asked me what kind of look I wanted to achieve, then proceeded to go get the makeup.  I thought so far so good, as I felt I described to her what I wanted overall, but I wasn' t specific to the point as to what exact color I wanted, seeing how she is a "make-up artist" and I just trusted she would use what flatters my feautures and skin tone.    I don't want to drag out the story more than it needs to be - but my exact feelings at the end of the makeup session was that I could've made my self look better than she did.  I asked for a smokey eye, in which she slathered on black and grey eyeshadow and just blended out the edges. There was no definition or depth or any kind of contrast.  I also told her I wanted a cat eye look, in which she proceeded to make me look like an ancient egyptian.  The lines she drew were way too thick, and instead of a subtle "wing" at the end of my eyes, she literally I kid you not, literally drew fish hooks.  I was horrified , and told her nicely that maybe the look was a bit too dramatic for a wedding.  She giggled sympathetically and toned down the wings/hooks, but even the toned down look was still super dramatic.  So by then I was just whatever about it, because if I had her wipe off the eyeliner, it would ruin all the other makeup on my face and it would take longer to apply it again, and I was in a crunch for time already.  All the while, ever since she applied the eyeshadows, there was a bunch of fallout on my cheek and below my eye.  I thought to myself she would probably brush it off at one point but she never did.  I pointed it out to her and she said "Oh, Okay."  And as she proceeded to attempt to remove the fallout, she giggled and said "This is what happens when you try to do things in a hurry."    Umm..........are you serious?   She spent half the time I was there running around the makeup floor searching for supplies.  From what I gathered, this make up artist was new.  Not sure if she is just new to this location or new as a makeup artist in general - though my instincts point toward the latter.  Even if she was new to the business - like seriously, people who do makeup tutorials on youtube do a better job. Whoever deemed her acceptable as a makeup artist should seriously have their own license revoked.    I was very disappointed with my face when she finished.  I looked like I was going clubbing.  In ancient Egypt.  Even when I go clubbing, I don't put on that much makeup.

In order to submit a review I guess you have to at least click one star.  But I just want to specify that I think Da Vang deserves 0 stars.   I'm not sure why this establishment has a solid 4 star average.  I guess people like to eat water flavored pho and water flavored everything, basically.  I haven't had food from this place in years, but since our regular spot was closed, we came in here to get our fix.    After our meal, I remembered why I hadn't visited this place for a long time. The food sucks.  And I feel bad for everyone who thinks this place is awesome, cause you guys have sterile taste buds.

Do I like their Asian sandwiches?  Yes.  Their coffee, yes.  Their pastries, sure.   But this review is based off of a recent experience with their (new?) breakfast sandwich.  Not sure how long they've had breakfast sandwiches on their menu but this was the first time seeing the option since I was last there.  So I came in for breakfast and I ordered a pate chaud and an almond croissant, so that didn't require any waiting.  My boyfriend on the other hand, decided to try their bacon/egg/cheese breakfast croissant.  After ten minutes of waiting, I was getting rather hungry so I started to eat my pastries.  5 - 7 minutes later after I ate my stuff, the breakfast sandwich still did not come out.  This was a 15-17 minute wait already, and the shop was not even busy.  Imagine sitting there hearing number after number being called (EXCEPT YOURS), and looking at people who came in 15 mins after you did, eating their food.  And you are just sitting there wondering where your shit is.  So we get up, walk up to the window and ask where our sandwich is.  The guy at the window states it should be coming out "soon" and the wait is due to the fact that the eggs are being made in the back of the kitchen.  Look, if you can't fry a damn egg in under 5 minutes, there is seriously something wrong with you.  If I were the manager, I'd either implement a training on how to efficiently cook an egg or just hire someone else who is more efficient, OR teach your employee to come up with better excuses.   After being told the sandwich is coming out "soon", we waited another 10-12 minutes.  I want to stress that I am not being dramatic about this, as there was another couple who ordered the same thing we did and were waiting a long time as well.  Frustrated, we asked for our money back and were subsequently told AGAIN that "your sandwich is coming out soon." I decided that if "SOON" was not 3 mins or less, I'd go ghetto on their ass.  Luckily for them, the sandwich came up a couple minutes after that.  I made it a point to check in front of the employee's face to see if the sandwich was piping hot, which it was, but that only proves the sandwich was recently made.    Lesson of the day for anyone working in the restaurant industry?  If you forgot someones food, just admit it and apologize.  Don't lie to me.  It doesn't take 30 minutes to put egg, bacon and cheese in between a croissant and heat it up.  The sandwich, I kid you not, was 4x4 in size, with 2 pieces of bacon, some cheese and an omelette style egg. Definitely NOT worth a 30 minute wait, especially in a fast food joint.  We should've just went to McDonalds across the street.    If I have to stand there and stare you down and make sure that you are making my food, I probably won't come back.

A few years ago, in a moment of weakness about more than halfway through the [echo canyon] trail, I felt like saying "Eff it, I'm tired."  Then I saw a man with a prosthetic leg pass me steadily.    If that isn't motivation, I don't know what is.  If that doesn't make you feel ridiculous for wanting to quit, I don't know what will.

I don't like this trail because of the terrain.  The rocks are jaggedy and sharp, and it's easy to slip because the rocks are loose.  I feel like if I fell from a height of 5 feet or more, I probably will be impaled.  I'd rather fall on Camelback's Echo Canyon trail's rocks, which are more rounded and smooth if that's any comfort.    This trail is known for it's similarity to a stairmaster, because you literally are climbing nature's steps.   It's a little boring for me because it's the same thing all the way to the top.  With Echo Canyon, you get level differences and terrain change and it just feels more adventurey, if you will.    I'm not rating this 2 stars because  I ate it on the way down and gave myself eternal scars on my legs ( I was trying to change songs on my ipod and wasn't paying attention like an idiot)... and not because it's a sucky hike - it's not.  You get a REALLY good workout and the wind knocked out of you if you've been slacking on your cardio, and great views at the top.  But I feel like for those looking for more of a challenge with an extra oomph, head to Camelback.

Not the best Thai food I've had ( the best Thai food I've ever had was in Maui, and it was being cooked out of someone's back yard and sold on the side of the street) but it's pretty good.    I've had their coconut milk soup, pad thai, pad see ew, basil fried rice, green papaya salad, green curry, panang curry and garlic chicken.  All of these are good, although the basil fried rice is a bit too moist and garlic chicken a bit salty for my taste.  Like most other Thai places, the spice level is 1 thru 5 stars.   If you like a good kick, I would say go with 4 stars.  If you like super spicy, skip 5 stars and ask for "thai hot."  I'm a very observant person and to be honest, the many times I've eaten here, I noticed the crowd and they're the type to care about "ambiance" and service rather than the actual food.  For me, it's about how good the food is, then I factor in the service and all that stuff.    The service here isn't exactly top notch.  If you're one of those who care about being asked about how you're doing every 10 minutes, then don't come here.    Overall, for the prices and location and quality of food, this place is really good.  I haven't had a dish where I was like, ew!

I dined here with a group of 4 girls and we each got different entrees so that we could share.   We ordered the foie gras and duck fat curry fries as appetizers and the following entrees:  sea bass, diver scallops, duck with chickpeas, and croquet madame papadelle.    I really liked the foie gras, although its not the best I've had.  It's a very tiny portion that they give you, so if you're sharing with foie gras lovers, best to get 2 orders.  Thankfully, no liked it as much as me so I ate most of it.  I liked everyone else's food except mine - the croquet madame papadelle.  I was hungry and didn't read the description thoroughly and didn't bother to ask the waiter to explain the dish so I pretty much ordered something that was different than what I thought it would be... my fault :/  Other than that, scallops were cooked perfectly, sea bass was flakey in a good way, duck with chickpeas = delish.   I feel like the service I received here should be the standard for all high end restaurants - I've been to way more expensive places than Petite Maison and received not so great service. And usually, I don't really care about "service", because if you read a lot of my reviews, I tend to really focus more on food than who is bringing me my food.  But if I'm spending 50+ on my meal, it's just kind of a given that I'm paying for the experience as well. With that said, our waiter was very nice.  Not the overbearing, hovering type.  He explained the menu thoroughly and didn't annoy us.  Maybe we just got the pick of the litter that night, haha.  That or they train their staff very well.  We ended the meal with a chocolate souffle that came with a raspberry sauce - the dessert as a whole was not too sweet which was a good thing.  I guess it just tasted like a very moist chocolate cake with... raspberry sauce.  =D  Oh yeah.  And the ambiance...   there's something about dimmed lights, candles and french words you can't read.  :)

Don't be intimidated, as the exterior and location screams GHETTO.  Like, as in seeing the same crackheads chilling outside the door every time you come type of ghetto.    Back in our clubbing/blacking out in bathrooms/barfing out our nasal cavity days, this was the spot the next Sunday morning for a bowl of hangover soup.  I'd like to think those days are far gone but do still occur from time to time, but I digress.....  The fact that my peeps and I still frequent  this place just to enjoy the food as non intoxicated human beings, is a good sign.    + Pre apology to Pho Thanh and all other pho places and all the vietnamese moms, but my mama's pho is the best.  With that being said, this place has pretty decent pho.  I tend to like my broth with a liiiiiitle more fat, as I feel Pho Thanh's broth is more "lean", if you will.  But it's still full of the right flavors, none of which over powers the other.  It's pretty consistent and that's KEY.    + Hu Tieu Bo Kho ( Beef Stew with Rice Noodle) - recently, I've taken a liking to this particular dish.  I have been getting it every time I come here, which is every other week.  It's nothing like american  beef stew, which can be thick and heavy in texture.  Bo Kho is more soupy/watery, but its flavor is super rich without being too much, and has a slight sweetness that blends extremely well with all the spices and herbs.  I love to dress my Bo Kho with the sate paste, extra cilantro and bean sprouts, and I request the wide rice noodle instead of the regular ones.  +Com Tam (Broken Rice) - Their rice dishes have a good selection/variety of toppings.  I usually just  get the broken rice with pork chop, and also request an egg over easy on top. Soooo simple but delish.    +Eggrolls - Not out of this world, but probably the best I've had in a vietnamese restaurant.  +Chao Ga (Chicken Rice Porridge ) -  Ever heard of the saying... show me your friends, and i'll tell you who you are?  Well, show me your rice porridge, and i'll tell you if suck.  And Pho Thanh doesn't.  It's comparable to home made rice porridge, with the perfect amount of chicken broth flavor, consistency is not too thick or thin, and its actually RICE porridge, not a bland bowl of water with a few grains of rice floating around.    I've yet to try and explore other menu items but these are the ones that really stand out in my mind right now and just remember that my 5 star review is based off of these alone.  I didn't factor in service and ambiance, because there isn't any.  Don't expect anyone to come by to ask how your food is.  I think they know their food is good.  Don't expect anyone to refill your water unless they aren't busy, and they usually are.

This location literally is down the street from me and I used to frequent it all the time when I still believed I could inject/inhale pure fat + NOT work out and never gain any weight.  Needless to say, I haven't been to this location for the longest time until a few weeks ago to pick up some for my brother.  It hasn't changed.    Same old disrespectful, careless tards working the drive thru.  When I pull up to the window to get my food, the person handing me my food just stares at me.  Not a "hello", not a "thank you", not a "have a nice day" ......I'm not expecting you to CARE but part of the etiquette of working in food service is to not look like your best friend just died and least say hello to the customer.    One time I asked for a large Dr. pepper and I was handed a small one.  So I told the girl working the window that she gave me the wrong size, in which she proceeded to snatch the drink from me without  an apology or any type of acknowledgement and then yelled very loudly and nastily at someone (while the drive thru window was open) "YOU DIDN'T TELL ME SHE WANTED A LARGE?"  Then pops back out the window and asks me "You wanted a large drink?"   YES MOTHAFUCKA.  That's what I just told you!  Ugh wthhhh.  I wouldn't be surprised if she spat in my drink.    My most recent trip?  I know I'm Asian but I'm told all the time and know for a fact that I have ZERO asian accent  - SO please tell me why when I placed my order, the person inside acted like I barked out the equation for a hyperbole?  They have hoodrats working in this joint.  These people should quit and sell drugs instead.

We came here as an alternative to Pho Kim Long, which is always frequented when in Vegas.  The only things better about this place than PKL are that it's cheaper and they have really generous portions.    The food was meh.  Their nem nuong rolls are huge, but that's cause they stuff it with lots of vermicelli noodle.  The nem nuong itself resembles and taste like sausage.... no pun intended. And theres like 2 pieces of it..  It wasn't terrible - just not very nem nuongish..  The rice plate that I had (bbq pork chop) was alright.  I thought it was a bit too salty.  And i asked for an egg over easy, but they fried the hell out of it.  I didn't expect awesome service  - I never do when I go to a Vietnamese restaurant. But on top of mediocre food, they have terrible service.  Therefore, the verdict of this review is 2 stars.

Seeing how the average rating of this place is 4 1/2 stars and I'm only giving it one star, makes me slightly reconsider my rating for a second -  am I just a super picky a-hole or is everyone else missing the queue here?  I'm going to go with the latter, although I'm going to say right now that my rating is based off of what we ordered.  Came here for a big group birthday dinner, and I must say, the staff was very accommodating and patient.  That's half a star.    Now on to the food -   I ordered the pasta trio and the boyfriend ordered the clams linguine.    Pasta trio - Basically a sample plate of three different pastas ( tortelli, gnocchi and ravioli.)  I wasn't expecting Lake Michigan portions, but I also didn't think my meal would be bite sized.  I'm not even exaggerating  - $19 dollar plate to feed an infant.  And it was mediocre.  I'd rather pop open a can of CHEF BOY R D and squirt some Sriracha on top.    Clams Linguine - If you want to know how this tastes and you happen to live near near the ocean, jump in it and swallow the water - and try to get some clams in there too if you can.  The dish was sodium overload, although clam count was abundant.    I'd rather eat at Olive Garden.  Yeah it's a chain and it's not hip and trendy and lots of  old people frequent it, but its a safe bet vs paying 50 + for a meal and then paying another 15 for Filibertos cause you leave starving, still.

This is seriously a hidden gem.  I mean it's not hidden, its like, right on the front of 24th  st and Indian School by a bus stop, but, I probably would have never given this place a second thought had a coworker not suggested it a while ago.   I find myself obessed with their Chicken Kahari.  It is just so freaking good.  It's like crack. So many complex flavors that I just can't comprehend.  It's under the curry section of their menu, but don't expect the typical creamy coconut based curry that we all know.  It's actually like a puree of tomatoes and a bunch of other awesome shit.  I know I'm not doing this dish justice at all so I'm gonna stop here, but please believe me when I say that you MUST try this dish. ( Get it SPICY)  I also like their Chicken Tika Masala.  It's similar to the Indian version, cubes of chicken breast immersed in delicious sauce, but again, this version is NOT creamy.  It's very dense in spices.  Oh and each entree comes with a huge naan (bread) the size of your face x 2.  And their portions are HUGE.   Service is very friendly and efficient.  What an awesome find in Phoenix, the city of not so awesomeness.

The salted caramel shake is seriously the best.  As a fellow yelper previously wrote, that it was the best thing she ever had the pleasure of sucking down - I would have to say I wholeheartedly agree.  And it comes with a big straw to allow for extra quick suckage.    I got the short rib tacos which were okay, it's not something I can see myself craving in the near future, but I ate the fries my coworker ordered and I absolutely love the seasoning on 'em.  I definitely will come back to try the burgers.

Came here solely for the iced milk boba with pudding (house special) because I heard it's comparable or similar to that of Half & Half's iced milk drink in Cali.     This place only made me crave half&half more - it's not that great.  The drink took forever to make, and when I got it, I was sorely disappointed.

This is a cool local restaurant - love the overall look and feel of it.  They're open 'til 1 or 2 am so I would definitely come back here in the future for drinks and hanging out.  The food was good.  We ordered the Bacon Board, St Louis Ribs, and Mac n Cheese.  The mac n cheese was reallllyyyy good.  Came out piping hot and had a nice crust on top.  The bacon board was very interesting, had about 5 or 6 different types of bacon with 2 different jams, bread and pickle.  There's no correct way to eat it,  you just kind of eat it how you want.  The ribs were good... great flavor but it couldve been a bit more tender and it wasn't hot, it was lukewarm.    The service was friendly - they weren't negligent or too bothersome.    I'd definitely come back to try other things on the menu

I think if I was trashed or high, I would've had a better experience.  But I was completely sober and I felt like I was in a horrible music video that was trying to imitate Project X, sans the swimming pool.  I actually think it's pretty cool that they have video games at the booths where you sit, and arcade games throughout the place - but because it was so crowded, there were people utilizing the skeeball machines as a bed to make out on.  It smelled like barf, which i'm not surprised because I'm sure people were throwing up in the corners and the smell is amplified and distributed in the air even more because its so damn hot and stuffy.    The good thing about it though - I remember a good variety of music was being played.  A mix of hiphop, rap, EDM....   I would prob come back.... if I was high.

Since writing my initial review, I received a message from a manager at Gringo Star and he apologized for my not so great experience, even though it definitely wasn't his fault.  He proceeded to offer to buy me a few rounds next time I come in for a more enhanced experience.  I am giving 5 stars this time because he is representing the business in a  good way, and his message was very nice and courteous even if my review was sorta mean.  I was just trying to be descriptive and super honest as possible.

I was stoked to hear about this place because I was hoping it would be the solution to my Boiling Crab cravings.  It's quite inconvenient to make the 350 mile drive to California...and I crave Boiling Crab like, everyday.    The concept is exactly the same as Boiling Crab - choose your seafood, choose your seasoning and choose your spice level.  There's a variety of fried seafood baskets that come with Cajun fries (or regular), wings, various sides such as corn and sausage- again, exactly like BC.  Only thing is, this place is obviously more expensive, as we don't live by the sea and it costs more to acquire seafood.    Anyway.  We came in with a group of 5 at about 6 pm so this is right before the dinner rush, so the place was quite empty.  We put in our order of 2 lbs of clams, 8 pieces of sausage, 1 corn, Cajun fries, a dozen naked fried wings, and a side of macaroni salad.   And about 15 minutes later our food came out.    + Taste/Flavor :  It has potential, it really does.  But our bag of seafood was not hot.  It was not even warm.  It was like, semi lukewarm, which translates to the combination of the butter and spices being completely separated and not mixed well to form any kind of harmonious deliciousness to coat the seafood.  The spices sat in globs throughout the bag, while the butter was stale.  Once we shake the hell out of the bag to attempt to mix the butter/spices, the overall flavor was good - not too salty, not to garlicky, but I ain't trying to mess with cold butter doughy globs of spices.  The wings were bland, but the texture was great.  Mac salad was just mac salad, corn is always good no matter what, sausage was sausage to me, and the cajun fries were the best part of my meal. They had a light breading that made 'em crunchy yet soft inside, and the seasoning was spot on.   + Service : Though our server was a nice person,  his service is nothing to write home about.  He forgot our Cajun fries and macaroni salad, which weren't brought out til we nearly finished our food.  He only checked on us once and never refilled our drinks - I had to flag down another server.  It wasn't even busy at the time.  I usually don't complain about service, as I'd rather be left alone to eat in peace but when I keep having to ask for multiple things that should've been brought to me, it gets annoying.  Those of us who are used to being spoiled by BC's deliciousness should keep an open mind when trying this place for the first time, as this ISN'T BC and it's a new restaurant and they're not established like BC, which is why I didn't come with high expectations.  It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great.

A modest, friendly family-owned donut shop that will take care of your donut needs.  They've got a selection of your usual donuts and the not so usual - especially the cereal topped donuts, which are a fresh update to the usual doughy texture of a plain one.  A must try!  It's everything a donut shop should be.  It sells donuts, and the donuts taste thankfully, like donuts.  I see myself frequenting this place before and/or after my Costco runs.  If you see a brunette (light brown) eating a donut inside of Costco, that's prob me.
