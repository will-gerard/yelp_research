Geisha is my favorite place to go to after work! Jimmy and Tucker are the most personal and friendly bartenders I have ever encountered! Cam always goes out of his way to say hi and to make sure I get my food quickly. The service prevails while the food and drinks follow a close 2nd :D

DO NOT MOVE HERE!!  Janell in the front office is extremely rude and only cares about hitting you with fees. It seems that all she cares about is money and not the resident satisfaction. I have been left multiple rude voice mails by her and her alone. If you don't pay rent on the first forget it, 50 dollar fee. I was told 2 days ago that I need to come in and sign my 60 day notice so I did. The rest of the staff was extremely nice saying they were going to miss me. Then I wake up this morning to a call from you know who... JANELL telling me that I would be charged an extra 12 days because I didn't sign it in time. Completely ridiculous!  Not only that but I have maintenance come probably 3-4 times a month to fix all types of problems. When my dryer was broken for a week I called to see what was taking so long and they said "oh they haven't been there yet?" Not only that but I have come home 3 different times to piled up cigarette butts on my door step. By the 3rd time I called to ask what was going on and they said maintenance tends to do that when they think you aren't pickings up your butts. So clearly this is an ongoing issue that needs to be resolved.   3 weeks ago my family was visiting and wanted to go to the pool while I was at work. They were kicked out by the front office saying they couldn't be there with out me... So they were forced to stay inside on a Saturday till I got home around 5pm. When I called and ask to speak to a manager I was told I would receive a call back. Never did.. How convenient for them.   I have lived here for 2 years and I can't wait to move out.

Honestly worst service I have ever gotten... Guy with bandana and beard sucks. Was rude and inconvenient and should not work there. Came there for an after bar experience and was treated like scottsdale trash. Never coming there again due to bartender....
