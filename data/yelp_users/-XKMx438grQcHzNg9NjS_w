I would have given 5 stars if they didn't over quote for every procedure. I've been a patient with them for about 10 years. Many dental and ortho procedures between myself and my son. Recently I was laid off from work and did not have insurance. I was waiting for my new jobs insurance to kick in. In the meantime, my son visited to get some work that was previously paid for done. The work that they did irritated another tooth (which they filled just 3 months prior) and he was back within days for awful pain. They advised him he would need a root canal and a crown and quoted him (a 19 year old kid) $2000! And maybe that's what it costs, but I did call 2 other places and got quotes for $1500. What really upsets me is that we have been loyal patents for many years and they knew we didn't have insurance currently. Why overcharge us?? To say I felt taken advantage of would be an understatement. No longer do hear places "care" for anyone other then themselves. Completely disappointed in how they handled this situation. Before today we were called "family" and welcomed wth emails , etc. Today, it's like they never met us or know who we are. We are just some insurance less people who they saw as an opportunity to make a buck. Pissed. And neither of us will ever be back. Also, they let my son go without a prescription for antibiotics. The least they could have done is call in a prescription for the infection in his tooth. Nope. Nothing.

Very professional. I have been going to Laseraway for almost a year now and the staff is efficient and courteous.  Appointments are always on time, great for people on the go.

I first just want to say that I am not novice to spray tan, as a professional athlete who competes in bodybuilding I've had my fair share of spray tans. With that being said, this place does amazing spray tans! They are even, the color doesn't turn orange, it doesn't have an overwhelming scent, and it lasts at least a week!! (Mine did)  I flew into town for a charity event and decided at the last minute to wear a dress. Being from Philadelphia and coming off of a long winter, I was closer to the color of Casper then anything. I wasn't able to book an appointment online so I thought I'd drop in and see if I could be fit in. It was not an issue. No problem I was able to get in within 10 minutes of my arrival.  The girl who sprayed me was very knowledgeable and professional and she really seemed to like her job...magic plus, how often do we run into people at these types of places that are miserable?! Anyway, great tan and worth the money. I will definitely be back next time I'm in town!
