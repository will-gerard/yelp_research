Went to get the Soup and Salad today and it was a disaster. We sat at the table without being attended to for a good 5+ minutes while all of the servers were hanging out by the front entrance. Finally a server walked by and noticed we had not been helped. He took our drink order and we went ahead and placed a lunch order. He told us that they did not have salad and that they were trying to get more. How does that happen? Whatever, we will still do the soup. They bring out the one bowl of soup and breadsticks and that was the last time anyone stopped by our table. After we ate our one bowl of soup we sat there for 10 minutes and nobody even acknowledged us. At that point we decided to leave because of the poor service. We told the manager on the way out that we had a horrible experience and that we weren't paying for the one bowl of soup. He didn't seem to care. This was a crappy experience. Especially since they were not busy. I can deal with the no salad, it was the lack of service that was inexcusable.

Today was the first time I've ever been to a sports clips and it won't be my last. I think I found a new favorite place to get a hair cut. They were fast, friendly, and most importantly, did a great job with the hair cut. Since it was my first time there they hooked me up with the works and I might get that the next time. The massage and shampoo was top notch.

I finally decided to stop by Gordas yesterday after driving past it for almost two years now.. I'm so glad that I stopped in and grabbed some tacos! The customer service was awesome. Very friendly and helpful staff. They recommended that I tried anything with adobada, and I'm glad I chose that. I ordered two adobada tacos with rice and beans. The tacos are a little smaller, but they load them up with meat and pico de gallo. Next time I will order three tacos or maybe try one of their burritos. They also have a clean salsa bar there which was stocked with good tasting salsa and toppings such as cilantro and onions. If you are thinking about going to Gordas, do yourself a favor and get off the computer and go now. You won't be disappointed.

Last year I was thinking about refinancing my home while the interest rates were low. A friend of mine referred me to Eric Aramian and Dawn Buxton. Eric and Dawn were very friendly, professional, and experienced. They made the process of refinancing my home quick, easy, and most importantly, affordable. They worked very hard and went the extra mile to make sure that I was satisfied with the transaction. Eric and Dawn were both very quick at replying to my e-mails or returning my phone calls whenever I had a question.    My experience with the refinance last year was so great, that when I decided to purchase a new home a few months ago, I went right back to Eric and Dawn. Again, they both provided excellent service during this transaction. They were able to help me close very quickly on a short-sale purchase.   I highly recommend Eric Aramian, Dawn Buxton, and their team to anyone that needs mortgage services. I plan on working with Eric and Dawn in the future whenever I decide to move again. I am very satisfied with the services that they have provided for me. I recommend them to everyone I know who is thinking about buying a home or refinancing their current home.   Do yourself a favor, call Eric and Dawn, they will take care of you.
