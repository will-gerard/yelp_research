Love, Love, Love this place!  I'm a craft beer nerd, and this place has the best selection in town.  All taps rotate daily, so you never know what you're going to get to choose from when you go, which is half the excitement!  Their refrigerated case also has pretty much anything you could ask for if what you want isn't on tap - they even have a few domestic mass-produced beers for your friends who aren't fans of "fancy beer". :-)  The staff are well-versed in what they have on tap and the differences, and even allow complimentary samples if wanting to decide between a few for a pint. They have a smaller food menu, but most of the staples are on it.  We love the pizza. And if  you've had enough, but aren't done... you can take a mix-and-match six pack from the case home with you.

Dr. Hunt is AMAZING! I have been a patient of hers since 2006 or so, and I trust no one else with my gynecological care. There are times where she is running a bit behind, mostly because she has been called in to delivery a baby, but in my opinion that is something that you should expect if you are going to see an OB/GYN. When the day comes for my own baby's delivery, I will be very happy that Dr. Hunt is right across the street from the hospital and can leave quickly to attend to my birth, so hopefully more patients are understanding of this when waiting in the waiting room.    Her staff is extremely nice, and I love the fact that I can have my labs drawn by LabCorp at her office and not have to make another stop on the way home to have this done.  She is also an amazing pelvic surgeon.  If I have to deliver by C-section, I will be very happy that she is my doctor.  I have seen her C-section scars (many friends have gone to her) and her incisions are almost unnoticeable.  She states that she closes her incisions with esthetics in mind. I love that.  And she is one of the nicest doctors I have met - she has a great bedside manner, is extremely progressive in her knowledge of OB/GYN topics, and always counsels me on whole body and health topics such as Vitamin D deficiency, exercise, and food choices, to name a few.  If you are looking for a fantastic OB/GYN, look no further.  She is a Top Doc for a very good reason!

I would return here for happy hour - margarita and chips and salsa or guacamole, but never again for dinner.  The fire roasted salsa and my house margarita were pretty good, but our entrees were marginal and extremely over priced.  I ordered the Mahi Tacos - they were flavorless, except for the overwhelming amount of red onion. My husband ordered the Shrimp Enchiladas, and was served the Spinach and Mushroom Enchiladas instead... My dad, who eats all things Mexican, only ate half of his plate.  If you're a foodie, skip it.  If you're not concerned with flavor, but enjoy a nice atmosphere, this might be a place for you.

I love Ilumina!  From the moment you walk through the door, you slip into a totally different place - so peaceful and serene. I wish I could be there every day. :-) I have been hearing rave reviews from friends and colleagues for years now, and am so excited that I'm at a point in my life where I can try this for myself.    I have seen both Dana and Cathy for regular treatments - Dana for fertility and Cathy for a shoulder problem.  Both ladies are extremely gifted in what they do! Wanting a more holistic approach to fertility, Dana was able to regulate my cycle within 3 months of stopping the pill.  She is very knowledgeable in all aspects of fertility  - from thyroid levels to diet to sleep to herbs -  and really counsels you in all areas for a whole-body approach.  Cathy was able to relieve most of a shoulder impingement in one session and had great advice on keeping my shoulder healthy.  This is now my go-to office for acupuncture - I drive from East Gilbert weekly to receive my treatments, and it's worth every mile!

Great sports bar atmosphere, with an even better menu. The best chicken bacon avocado sandwich ever is here!  The grilled chicken alone (which is an option as a healthy entree) is marinated in a pineapple concoction, and makes it flavorful and fantastic!  The bacon is thick, Applewood smoked, and the sandwich comes with a generous portion of steak-cut, seasoned fries.  They also have a nice selection of local beers on tap - always nice to see Four Peaks' HopKnot IPA on draft!

Let me start by saying that I've used the Ray Rd. location on and off for years, and have always had great service and will go back.  I've tried this location twice, and will not be returning.  My first experience here was about a month ago. I needed a quick wash on my SUV, and requested an exterior-only wash that had been done for me at Ray Rd.  They stated it was no longer on the menu and I would need to purchase the regular wash instead for twice the price.  They also grilled me about getting my car detailed because they were running a "special", which turned out to be their normal price.  When I went to the counter to pay, my receipt stated that I could return within a few days and receive an exterior-only wash for half the price of my regular wash!  I informed the cashier that I was told that it was no longer on the menu, and she said that wasn't true and that they still do them. :-(  Fast forward to yesterday... I pulled into the drive lines and asked for an exterior-only wash, and the man (a different one than before) became very confrontational with me telling me that they no longer do them and I would need to pay for the regular wash.  I explained that I did not need anything done on the inside, and that the cashier said the exterior-only was still on the menu.  He started yelling at me, saying she was wrong and she didn't know what she was talking about.  I didn't want to argue with him as I was holding up the line, so I agreed to the regular wash, AGAIN.    I understand that businesses are still struggling, but the way to succeed is to accommodate your customers and keep your policies consistent, not confront your way into selling a more expensive service.  And in the end, my car was streaky and parts were not cleaned. :-(  I will return to the Ray Rd. location when needed, but Val Vista is no longer getting my business.

Love this place!  Great selection of craft beer on tap, and tons of choices for pizza.  I especially like the fact that you can do a half-and-half combo - my husband can choose one of the "fancy" combinations and I can do the traditional supreme without ordering two individual pizzas. The sizes of pizzas are a little smaller than I expected, just to warn you - a large was the size of a medium in a lot of other pizza places. I've also had the buffalo wings, and my husband had the chicken prosciutto sandwich - both were fantastic!  Even more impressive than the food is the atmosphere and customer service.  The managers great you with a smile when you walk in, and the wait staff and bartenders are super friendly and have lots of recommendations.  The atmosphere and menu reminds me of the Champps that used to be at the Biltmore, and this place is MUCH quieter than Zipps and Buffalo Wild Wings with a great selection of TVs for watching your favorite game.  If you're looking for a down to earth casual sports bar atmosphere with a tinge of a higher-end feel, you will probably like this place.  We have been here 4 times so far and plan to be regulars!

If you've ever been frustrated with the typical physical therapy experience of repetitious exercises day in day out with limited progress, please give Eric and his team a try. This office does NOT subscribe to the cookie cutter PT experience! You are given a whole-body, functional assessment evaluation at your first session to determine what other factors and areas in your body may be contributing to the pain and dysfunction you are experiencing. They blend manual trigger point therapy, range of motion exercises, Graston technique, dry needling, and strengthening exercises to customize your treatment plan based on your symptoms and limitations at each session. You also work closely with the physical therapist, not just the assistant. They also give you practical homework and also resources for other therapies that can complement your care and speed up your progress.  I recently saw Eric to rehabilitate a shoulder impingement from a workout injury, as well as pelvic instability and nerve entrapment from the delivery of my daughter. He was able to rehabilitate both areas quickly so that I could start exercising again. He referred me to a great personal training studio where I was able to start strengthening my core and back as a part of my postpartum recovery as a part of my treatment plan.  I have known many people to choose Chandler Physical Therapy for their PT due to their customized treatment approach, and their genuine care and concern for their patients' care and progress. And they are just all around great people. Highly recommended without reservation!

My husband and I are extremely familiar with many of the area pet stores having had all sorts of reptiles, cats, and aquariums over the years, and from the moment this store opened, we have been impressed.  What makes a great shop or business is the diversity of product, extensive knowledge about the product, competitive pricing, and fantastic customer service, and this place has it all!  The owners and staff are well-versed in all areas (dogs, cats, reptiles, exotic small animals, and fish), and are super friendly and helpful.  They also have the stamp of approval from one of the local exotic veterinarians and are linked up with a  number of animal rescue organizations that you see on site for weekend adoptions.  I originally heard about this shop as a former patron of Pet's Inc. in Tempe.  We were sad to see Pet's Inc. close, but very happy to hear that the staff had plans to open a similar concept on their own!  The walls of animal areas are color coded for easy location by animal type and product is organized and stocked on shelves in a very logical, easy-to-find- manner.  I'm also happy to see that they have higher quality cat and dog food like Wellness and Blue Buffalo, for great prices.  Our most recent experience was buying 55 gallons of pre-mixed saltwater, live sand, live rock, and two clownfish for a start-up 55 gallon aquarium.  Again, fantastic customer service in helping us with our needs for this tank.  We also have been going regularly for coral frags and shrimp for our saltwater nanoreef since the store opened.  Nice selection of coral, fish, and cleaner crew, so we will be heading back regularly as our new tank evolves.  It's refreshing to see owners and staff so passionate about their business, and we will gladly be supporting them in the future.  Can't wait to see how this place grows!

First things first... This is NOT CrossFit! This is better than Cross Fit... this is effective strength training and movement therapy for all ages and abilities, without the meat-market atmosphere.  I can't say enough about Funktional Fitness and the impact it has had on me - it has changed my life. I recently had my first child, and in addition to having quite a few extra pounds to lose, I was also recovering from some physical effects of the delivery. I was referred to Luis and Jeremy by my physical therapist because he knew that they could help me regain my pelvic and core stability, and overall strength, with their knowledge of functional movement and exercise.  My initial assessment proved what I was feeling, that I was weak and unstable. Luis recommended that I start with 1:1 private training sessions to work on fundamentals while building my strength so as not to injure myself in the process. Their expert instruction on form and their method of working the entire body in segments with different exercises each session keeps the training interesting and is extremely effective.   5 weeks after starting the private training I was re-measured and had lost 4% body fat and a few pounds. I went shopping and had to buy jeans 2 SIZES smaller than I had been wearing 5 weeks before. I had a waist again. And I felt strong!  I continue to work with Luis and Jeremy 2 times a week to get me to my postpartum goal, and my husband has started going to their GroupFit classes with great success. Keep it up guys, you and your staff are amazing.  Highly recommended without reservation!
