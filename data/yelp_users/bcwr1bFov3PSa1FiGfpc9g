Great homemade hot breakfast sausage and a wonderful family restaurant feel.   Reminds me of the one my parents used to own in Mi.   Have fun finding a table on the weekend :)

Made a trip to Pittsburgh and my oil change light came on in my truck! I knew this Jiffy Lube as I had been there before when I live in Pittsbuugh and they do work on fleet vehicles.   I arrived around 3:40PM this particular day and they closed at 5PM. They got me right in- they called LeasePlan and had my truck done within 30 minutes and that was with an air filter change.  You may think this is nothing and this is all normal, but you need to understand with a Fleet truck, a lot of places say they do "fleet vehicles" then you bring it in and they have no clue and they take 4 hours for an oil change. So I really appreciated the fact the guys were quick and efficient.   They vaccum the vehicle and clean all your windows. They are also VERY friendly, they all asked how I was and if my day was going ok. Very good personalities, which is always a plus for customer service.   I cannot tell you their pricing as I see none of that. I assume they are fairly priced.

If you are looking for good mediterranian food this is your place in the suburbs of Pittsburgh.  They do not have a gluten free menu but they will work with you. Their house salad is super yummy as is their hummus, all homemade.   They also have a salad that has a homemade ranch dressing, at the moment I cannot recall the name. Sorry!  Decently priced. They also have a large drink menu and a bar.

YUMMY! Not your typical chinese food what-so-ever. If you get the right waitress who can understand you she can help you work around the gluten free options and tells you what to avoid.   They also have a thai menu, their pad thai and curry is very good. It has good flavor and is a large portion. I always have enough for the next day or two.   Their lunch menu is the perfect size, it incudes a smaller portion, hot tea and soup/eggroll whichever you prefer, obviously I give both of those to whoever I am eating with.   Great for Take-out!

The best steak I have eaten in the US.  We ate there twice while we were in town for a training class. Both times the filet was like butter, you didnt even need a knife.   The cheesecake was very yummy as well.   I dont remember which sides I had with my steak, that could be due to the fact that they weren't all that great or it was because I was so focused on my delicious steak.   If I ever travel to AZ again, I will make sure I stop here to eat.

Service is REALLY slow, the waitresses are not very friendly and they have no clue what is going on.   Dont expect to be in and out quick. We have gone for lunch since it is close to our office and you will see retirees sitting at the bar drinking at 11:30 AM, they allow smoking so avoid this place if it bothers you.  Food is not worth the wait, although it is cheap...which means its not high qaulity.

Another one of my favorite places in Pittsburgh to eat.  Great portions and delicious food.   I get the eggplant stuffed with ricotta ( it is breaded so I order is sauteed since I am gluten free).  They also have very good salads, the dressings are all fantastic.   This is a busy place so be prepared to wait for dinner.

If I could rate different aspects of this meal I would. The service was definately lacking at this Roy's-and we have been to a few since they have a gluten free menu.   I felt bad for our waiter-he didn't understand the gluten free aspect and messed up the order at first and the final bill.   He apologized but it was more of me telling him, no the menu says this so it's this price etc etc. He came back and said "you were right" well duh! I usually am...jokes people!  The gluten free menu here is VERY limited, if you have been to the Roy's in baltimore you will be disappointed in this one. I think there were 5 apps you could pick from, 3-4 main courses and 2 desserts. They did not have a seperate GF drink menu.   We did the prix fixe menu. We both got the california rolls (YAY they are made with real crab instead of the wheat filled imitation). Our waiter brought us the wheat filled soy sauce, luckily he had another waiter who seemed a little more aware of gluten allergy who brought the correct soy sauce out. (Tamari)  Jason for the braised short rib-very tastey. I got the lemongrass chicken with jasimine rice and curry sauce-I love thai flavors. The chicken was lacking flavor but the rice and sauce were melt in your mouth.   We then both ordered the GF chocolate souffle. not disappointed there either.   There are 2 Roy's in vegas, we did not have the chance to go to the other one.   Service-disappointing for Roy's and the knowledge of GF was lacking. Food was still flavorful and melt in your mouth.  Many kids in this Roy's-surprising for me, the other ones we have been too are much more adult oriented.

A great place in Mt. Lebo. We went for brunch on a Sunday and they were very helpgul for my gluten free diet.   I had the scrambled eggs with salmon and goat cheese (DELICIOUS).   The boyfriend has some type of french toast and loved it.   I want to go for dinner sometime, they open up the doors when the weather is nice. A great atmosphere.

I am gluten free, I just discovered this place after living in Mt. Lebo for 6 months.   They have a great gluten free menu, unlike other restuarants who say they are "gluten free" they actually have things besides, salads, steaks and veggies.   They offer pizza and pasta! I did not give this a 5 for the fact that the restuarant itself could use a make-over.  To me it is considered a hole-in the-wall type place which most people fo not prefer.   I brought co-workers here on 2 seperate occasions and they enjoyed it, but again some people may not want to try it out due to the fact that it looks like nothing from the outside.   Big portions, tastey good and GLUTEN FREE options that far exceed most chain restuarants (which I despise).

The best fresh fish in Pittsburgh, they have an awesome menu that offers sushi as well as fish sandwiches. Everything is made there and cut there, they offer soy wraps with the sushi if you are gluten free.   They help a lot with the gluten allergy, this place is always busy on the weekdays for lunch! Tuesdays are packed, it is all you can eat fish tacos ( salmon, tuna and yellow tail)   I take people from our corporate office here and they have all loved it, I have not met anyone who has been there and had a bad experience.   Parking can be a pain, but somehow I always manage to find a spot with my big truck.

This is one of my favorite Italian Restaurants in the Pittsburgh area. I am gluten free and they now offer gluten free pasta! YAY!  The sauce that they put on their seafood pasta is amazing...very good flavor.   Sometimes the service is not all that great but overall this place is a good stop if you like pasta.

I know being a girl this may seem biased, but this food was terrible.  I work in construction and went in with about 20 upper management guys and myself ( I am management). I have a good sense of humor and can hang with the best of them, I go to places all the time with barely clad girls due to the industry I work in... The table I was sitting at hardly touched their food and they were not at all impressed with the "atmosphere".   I can see where the draw is....I was not at all impressed either were most of the guys I was with. The talent was not that great. I would say C-team. Our waitress was not all that intelligent either, she messd up our order and we had to remind her to get our drinks...

Once again, I move from Pittsburgh only to make a weekend trip back for a Breast Cancer Volleyball Game to find another great gluten free Thai place.   Its downtowns so be ready for traffic and crappy parking-if you are from Pittsburgh know already know this-if you are not-be patient!  It was a saturday night and we did not make reservations-we actually were planning on going somewhere else that had a long wait so I hopped on this wonderful world of YELP! And found Nicky's.   They sat us right away, the space is VERY small and cramped, you will be getting to know your neighbor very well.   The menu is extensive, I was overwhelmed and stuck with the same thing I always get, as did Jason. All my sensories were overwhelmed by the menu, the hustle and bustle and the amount of people in this tiny place!  Jason got sake and I got the jasmine hot green tea. Both came out quickly. The waiter was not 100% certain of the gluten items they had so he waved another waiter over to help. She knew the menu well and informed me of some things I could and could not have.   We started with the crispy peanut tofu-I loved it, Jason was not sold. He is not used to tofu though (the texture canm be different for some people). It was a large portion, I probably would have been full and content with just that.   But of course I had to order my ever trusty red curry! Its probably the best curry I have ever had. I loved the presentation of the food (gold bowls and plates). The portions were very large, I took home enough for two more meals. I did have to ask for extra rice, they skimped on that. There was an extra charge for more rice.  I ordered mine hot (6), and it was perfect! Many places do not get their levels right, this place has no issue. It came with peppers, eggplant, peas and chicken in it. They have other protein for it if you wanted something different. My curry was loaded with ingredients, again you don't see that often.   Jason ordered the pad thai (this is his go to as well). He doesnt do well with spicy so he got mild. It was perfect temperature for his NY/Canadian sensitive mouth. (they don't know what spicy is). (level 3) His had great flavor, sometimes thai can be very bland-this was not even close. It has an authentic flavor-he ordered shrimp with his. They were larger shrimp, not the little baby shrimp you see most places.   The price was somehwat up there, I think our meal came to about $50.00 for both of us.  I didn't have to ask for a refill once on my drinks-the service was that good. I could not believe the amount of people who were working such a small place, but they really are on top of things. If you read my reviews you know I am HUGE on customer service. This place does not disappoint on any level. I can't wait to go back to the  Burg' and eat here in April.

Service was quick, friendly and efficient as breakfast/lunch places should be. They did not disappoint in that aspect. I ordered the scramble, meat lovers and it was more than enough for one person! I probably could have split it with someone; I did end up taking half home. Mine was a little dry so I asked for a side of sour cream.  My sister ordered two eggs, potatoes and toast-hers was a little greasy for her liking so she soaked up some of the grease with napkins. Jason ordered the chorizo omelet, very tasty!  Good flavor.   One nice touch, the owner came around to every table and made people feel welcome and asked how their meals were.
