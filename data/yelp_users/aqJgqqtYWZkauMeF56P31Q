Grew up eating this! We walk right through the back door. Dont come here if your looking for atmosphere.Its all about the hot, fresh crispy food. Looove the pork fried rice, sesame chicken, ice tea and those big ass deliciously fried egg rolls! The oldies playing in the back deffinatley sets the mood. Family music right there. This place is love.

Horrible service. Received my sushi 1 hour after ordering and after all my friends had received their food AND finished eating it.

Never anywhere to sit and study. No outlets for your laptops in cafe area. Outlets have post it notes saying BROKEN and have said that since I started coming here for about a year now. I think there are only 2 working outlets against a wall and someone is most likely using them already. They do not accept Starbucks gift cards. Although I do enjoy the variety of books.

On 11/20/15 I had the most amazing service from a very happy waitress. It was my boyfriends and I 1 year anniversary. She was soo positive and attentive. I never had such great service especially for a chain restaurant which is usually why we stay away from them, Thankyou for a great night!

Amazing food, friendly, quick service. This place is usually packed so you know it's good but the line moves fast. I could eat here every single day. The food is fresh and extremely flavorful. I had a bad experience with the falafel at Pita Jungle and so I decided to try them here and WOW, they are to die for. I'm so happy I live so close. It is worth your trip!

Pharmacy staff is rude. Do not have the basic capabilities to smile or be kind. Do not say Thankyou. Store staff has always been kind. That's too bad.

Quality has really gone down. You won't get what you pay for. Save your money, do it yourself! Left my emergency break up did not bother to put it down.

I wish I could give no stars. The GM is a TOTAL CROOK. and got waay to into my personal life when I told him I wanted to quit the next day after siging up after I found out I was completely ROBBED 150+$ startup fee. Ill be honest if was my first gym I didn't know what to pay. Maybe that's what everyone else payed? Jeeze gyms are expensive. Then I asked around and many people I had talked to had got it either waay cheaper or no startup fee. SO I asked for a refund. Hard to get a refund. DO NOT GO HERE. Im sure they work off of commission and make it seem like the only possible way to sign up is by paying 150+$ and then some.

5 stars. NO complaints. Easy to sign up. affordable. Always clean even members clean up after themselves with that spray bottle full of pink stuff next to the paper towels. I enjoy the women's room it makes me feel comfortable.

Amazing. I keep going back for more. I'm in love! The ladies are so sweet and always give us a small dessert sample after our meal. One of my favorite restaurants EVER!

The bartender did not seem to like his job. Told us the "truth" about the drinks and not to get the dollar shots when you'd think he would try to sell it to us anyway lol. He just seemed stressed. Not to mention the hour wait due to our bills and orders being mixed up. Tacos weren't great. Ahhhhhh but I did enjoy my margarita. Will I be back? To be continued.....

Amazing! I saw Legally Blonde a few months ago and was completely blown away!!!!!!! The show was amazing. The actresses and actors were so amazing, talented and beautiful. Dining staff made me feel special. A beautiful meal, dessert and table. I will be coming back one day!

I wanted to like this place. Who else is open with happy hour with sushi at 2am when I'm having horrible cravings? But the service was bad. The waiter seemed to be pissed off or something and pretty much took it out on us muttering under his breath and all. It ruined our happy vibes and made us feel awkward. Just a very disappointing first time experience and sadly my last visit.

Your employees are by far the rudest of any business establishment I have ever been to in my entire LIFE. Major attitude adjustment needed! P.S your bathrooms smell like shit right next to your kitchen. Not a good look.

I had a very poor experience last Sunday with a waiter. She was no where to be found 90% of the time. I was sitting at the table with about 8 other people and I stuck my card in there as we were all going to split up the tab. Heck I even whipped out my pen figuring I would make it easier on the poor girl and circled what items where mine as well as putting the last 4 digits of my card next to these items. We were all mid splitting up the card, got interrupted, turned around and what do you know someone snatched up the bill and put it ALL on my card. ALL 8 people's orders food drink ALL of it on my card. Some of the items I was charged for we didn't even receive as we had been "forgotten". So I ended up having to go through the hassle amongst 8 people's orders and my debit card and cash when this all could have been avoided if she hadn't so hastily ran to swipe my card out without even reading any notations I had made on the receipt or even simply asking if we were finished. It was all so quick and all so inconvenient. I had been to the Tempe location and I really enjoyed myself and the food. I really want to like this place but it just turned me off entirely to El Hefe.

I am in love with this place! Amazing fresh sushi and sashimi. Absolutely the best yellowtail I have ever had in my life hands down. The best part is I live minutes from here!

Such a SHAME that the food is really good here and the SERVICE IS THE ABSOLUTE WORST. I refilled my own waters, picked up my own coffee from the bar and cleaned up our spilled orange juice 20 minutes after the server spilled it and said "OOPS sorry Ill grab the busser to clean it up". Just HORRIFIC. Biscuits and gravy were perfection but with service like that I won't be back. I also saw many other tables waiting to even order drinks unfortunately. Sad.

Not fun anymore. Sticky, disgusting floors. Overcrowded, musty, no space to dance or enjoy oneself. And yes OVERPRICED sugary, hardly any alcohol in it drinks. Not where I want to spend my Friday nights.

I came in with knee pain that I've been having for months. Doc moved my entire leg around, did not touch my actual knee once. He gave me a prescription for ibuprofen and and a prescription for an X-ray in 1 MONTH. It has been hurting for MONTHS. Why would I wait another month for whatever is going on to get worse? Done.

I usually love this place and have no issues. Today I bought a Taro boba and have become extremely nauseous.

WORST SERVICE IVE EVER EXPERIENCED IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. I had to chase down waiters  to get water, menu, order and get my check. I might as well have made my own food.

The fried chicken salad is 5 star. I absolutely LOVE it and crave it and will keep coming back for it. A huge amazing fresh salad with fresh chicken for 8$ you can't beat that. The servers are welllllll hit or miss. Some are awkward and I have to be the first to greet THEM hello and make eye contact to let them know we are ready to be seated OR we will have a great server like I did a few days ago (a cute peppy Asian girl I don't know her name). The HH is great. I enjoy the zipparitas. My boyfriend enjoys the fish and chips. Would just like for less awkward servers and the stare down and more friendly, welcoming smiling faces.

So I just gotta membership so I will update as I go. A little history about my gym habits I was a member of LA fitness, EOS and Fitness works. Although I did enjoy fitness works I would have to say I am really enjoying planet fitness this far. It is a nice small gym with plenty of equipment, no weirdos staring at you while you are trying to workout, everything is immaculate and CLEAN! I have never seen or smelt a more cleaner gym! I really enjoy the 30 minute sections for those of us who need a little guidance while working out. To top it off black card members have access to hydro massage beds (massage water beds that feel amazing), tanning beds and a relaxation room. I mean what gym has a relaxation room? Not to mention the cute sayings on the wall "NO JUDGEMENT ZONE" or another one that says "YOU BELONG HERE". I feel very comfortable in this gym. It if for your average person looking to better their life and enjoy themselves.

Very good but I still don't know what the hype is about. Whataburger and Culvers still have better chicken strips. Subpar for a quick weekday dinner.

Just got back from having dinner there. I had a wonderful experience as usual. Nothing but upbeat happy vibes, good music and friendly staff. I think the owner came to our table 3 times to check on us tonight. I saw her mingling with other tables letting them know about happy hour and different specials. I have never seen any manager/restaurant owner do that before so it was surprising in the best way! She let my boyfriend and I take a picture with a live lobster she was carrying around! I really enjoy this place. I will always come back.

Omg had a margarita that had to be PURE tequila. Had them remake it STILL pure tequila. Ahhh!!!! And it's hard to get a waitress to notice you! We sat no joke at a table virtually in the middle of the restaurant and I feel like the waitresses didn't want to acknowledge us or something. We finally caught the attention of a really nice waitress but it was a struggle to get anyones head to turn our direction. It's sad cause I really want to like this place.
