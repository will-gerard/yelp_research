Four stars because I have never left disappointed. Sure there are things the management could do better, it could be nicer inside, the appetizers could be a tad more appealing, and the wait staff could be a bit better at remembering things, but that's not why you come here.  The location is perfect, it's close to most everything downtown - the drinks are cheap to reasonably priced (you won't get nickle and dimed here), and the bartenders are great to talk to. They have a great selection of whiskey and scotch, and must better prices than other downtown bars (I'm looking at you Hanny's)!

This is a tough review to write. On the one hand their cook is incredible! He's nice, remembers your order, and makes one of the best Breakfast Burritos in town! I would highly recommend getting the Bacon one and adding jalepenos.   Also, if you go there for lunch and get one of their specials, it is very generica cafeteria food. Of the items served on their specials, typically one is pretty good, one is really bad (to the point you can't eat it), and one is mediocre.   While the food passes the test for cheap quick food, what kills this place in the ratings is the cashier's ability to be unfriendly, almost all of the time. If you go there just once or twice, you wouldn't even notice it. But, if you go there most days of the week for breakfast, it starts to ruin the great breakfast burrito.  I'll still eat here, but if anyone recommends anywhere else, count me in!

This is your local dive bar. It is excellent for walking to and then taking a cab back. The staff is great, they have a little edge and are able to carry a conversation. The Hidden House's tap selection isn't the reason you come here, but they do have frosty mugs.  If you come here, you have to get the pitchers, they're incredibly cheap and they keep coming. There is pool, darts, tvs, and internet at the bar. I've only been once since I moved outside of walking distance, but it may be time for a return!

The pizza combinations don't get better than Pizzeria Bianco! Of course there's a wait, but here's the way you do it. First, go with a group, 4-6 people. It makes the entire experience better and you can try all of the different pizzas. Next, make sure someone in your group gets there at 4:30 to wait in line and put your name on the list - Being in the first wave of people is great, but I prefer to be in the second wave who gets to go in. Being in the second wave, with a group, allows you time to hang out at the bar next door and wait for the server to come get your group. However, your group should probably buy the person who gets there early a round or two.  Once you get in, go all out, order an appetizer, order a pizza (and put more stuff on it!), and go for a dessert. The service is excellent and you won't be disappointed! Just make sure to invite me with your group!

Go here for the food and to have one or two drinks. This is definitely a place to start a long night in Tempe or a place to order take out from when you are just watching a movie on the couch all night.  Their European beer selection is pretty decent for a place that just one fridge holding it's entire beer selection (Yes, they have Boddingtons).   The Pasty's are great! I typically order the Bangers & Mash one, while my girlfriend orders Chicken Pot Pie with extra gravy, which she swears by. I've read good reviews about their desserts, but I've always been too full.   Definitely a great place!

I'm not going to go into a review of the food here, even though I had steak and lobster, which was incredible! The point of this review is for their bar. Since I discovered and Old Fashioned, I have been looking for bars that serve an excellent one. Well, I found my Phoenix Old Fashioned location! It was almost perfect, the only way it could have been better is if their ice were something other than just cubes. It was the perfect amount of citrus, perfect amount of bitters, and perfect amount of alcohol. I had mine made with Jameson, and I will definitely have another the next time I go.   This Old Fashioned destroyed the drinks from Mable's on Main (Scottsdale), Turf (Phoenix), and a number of other places around the valley.   This would make a great place to go to dinner and have a few drinks before going to see a movie while at Tempe Marketplace. I have heard the happy hour specials at The Keg are pretty good.

I can not say enough good places about Local Breeze! This is one of the best places to be for lunch during the week or for their great drink specials on Wednesday nights! I know they have other great drink specials, but I can get away from their $3 sangrias (Wednesday nights only - I think).

Great food, great selections and a great happy hour. Now this is a place to come and watch football on Sundays! I will update this post after the next time I go, this first time I only had one beer and don't think that is enough to rate their food, atmosphere, etc. But so far, I'm a fan!
