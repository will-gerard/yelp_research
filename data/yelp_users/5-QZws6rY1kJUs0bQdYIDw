Drove by many times before dining in one night with 2 kids, and a mother in law. The place is small but well appointed and has dim lighting, just like you'd expect for an Italian place.  The house ravioli is excellent, the recommended starter.  I think I had the tortellini, it was good, big portion, flavorful. After desert, the trimisu and chocolate gnash desert, our waiter dropped off a round of sambucca on the house.  They must do this for everyone, their way of saying thanks.  The service was above average and the cuisine hit the spot with me, so I'll be back again.

Went on the last open day of the season, November 9th.  Most of the activities were open, if not all, and there were no crowds.  On the downside, $9 admission  for any one over 2yrs old is slightly steep for the product being sold.   They wouldn't even cut me a deal on a dented pumpkin, one of the few that wasn't already rotting.  Its the last open day of the year and no bartering on a pumpkin? Perhaps my review is more generous than they appear to be.

Exclusiv Motorsport offers unparalleled service and knowledge on VW/Audi motors.  Derek is personable, honest, and cares about his work.  He recently serviced my carbon caked 2.0T A3, didn't hit me on the extra work hours it took to do the job(correctly), and swapped the t belt. I was impressed that he kept the quoted 1 day repair time,  showed me the old parts he replaced, and recommend DIY maintenance.  Exklusiv is an excellent choice, in many people's opinions the only choice, for service or high performance applications.  These guys do solid work, no question.
