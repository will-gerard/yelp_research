I've lived near this Baskin Robbins for years and seen it through the change in ownership. I go to Baskin Robbins because their Mint Chocolate Chip is my favorite flavor. I don't have much of a sweet tooth so every once in a while when I do want ice cream I try going to this location. I have gone 4 times in the last 6 months and of those 4 not one time did they have Mint Chocolate Chip. It's disappointing, it's not that hard to keep an inventory and keep something in stock. I would be understanding if it happened once but 4 times means there is a something wrong. Won't be going back to this location.

I moved into Canyon Ridge in late July 2013. I am a college student who does nothing that a typical college student does, my studies are important to myself and my roommate and when looking for an apartment for our senior year internships in the Valley, Canyon Ridge offered affordable and by far the cleanest and most renovated for cost apartments in the area. We frequently enjoy the pool and spa as well as free covered parking in non-reserved spaces. Yes the apartment can be a little rowdy at times with children but they are always inside at a reasonable time. The staff is amazing! I love Norma, and Chris the maintenance man always gets everything done so fast he's truly a blessing. The only thing that prospective renters should be warned about is the Haunted House that runs Sept-Oct on the South end of the complex. It was really annoying when trying to enjoy opening up the windows to save some money only to hear screaming, chainsaws and loud music until late hours of the night. Request an apartment on the North end if possible and this won't even be an issue! To end on a postive note I have enjoyed the time I have spent living at Canyon Ridge and I believe it is a good fit for multiple types of renters.
