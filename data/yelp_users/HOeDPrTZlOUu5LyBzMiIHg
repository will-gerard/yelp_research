I went to the Phoenix Theatre yesterday for the 1st time and I truly loved every minute of it.   The Theatre itself is smaller than I expected and the stage is abnormally tiny- most High Schools have bigger auditoriums, but the scenes are setup so perfectly you truly forget how small the Theatre actually is.   I LOVE this place! I will go back again and again and not be ashamed to stand in the will call line to get tickets until I purchase my season tickets.   I am excited to look into the Children's Theatre productions that are put on in the little Theatre. I know my 6 year old will enjoy it as much as I enjoy the adult productions.

My family and I have had our Phoenix zoo membership for 1 year now. We love it! It is worth every penny. We go at least 1 time per month and always have a great time. The volunteers are extremely friendly, we have only met 1 who was not. Even when it is too hot in the summer to do anything outdoors we go to the zoo. We play at the water park then go straight home.   We watch many families (parents) rushing their children through the zoo to the point that the kids don't have fun. With a membership we are always walking at a leisurely pace. Sometimes we go and only see a hand full of animals. Sometimes we go to ride our bikes around and don't stop at the animals at all.   We love that the new Kimono Dragon exhibit is in, and are excited to see the Orangutan exhibit being started. My daughter is learning quite alot at the zoo. At 5 she is already interested in traveling the world to see these animals in their native habitat.   Now, I must say... If you have been to the San Diego zoo, please realize that the Phoenix Zoo can not compare. So, don't go to the Phoenix Zoo expecting anything more than a great zoo for education purposes. But, it is the 2nd best zoo I have been to.   My family is from a small city in Arizona. We moved to Phoenix primarily due to the culture a big city can provide for raising children. I chose to live in S. Scottsdale specifically because the Phoenix zoo is about 2 miles away from my home.

I was a bit nervous going into the shop for the 1st time. I had seen reviews on other sites that said the staff was not friendly, and I was needing to ask a lot of questions. I found the staff very helpful. They know their merchandise and can direct you right to the hard to find items. You can find ANYTHING you want for cake decorating.   The first time I went into the store I was looking for supplies needed to make a princess cake. I saw a cake at a local grocery store and went in looking for the supplies needed to make it myself. They had exactly what I needed all prepackaged in a kit.   Recently, I sent a friend of mine in because she was throwing herself a Double Quncineta  (she was turning 30.) I made her a beautiful cake but told her she needed to find her decorations. She found everything she needed for her gag b-day cake. The staff at ABC told her they want pictures.    Prices are reasonable.  I have found that most stuff is cheaper than buying online, but be prepared...  As other reviews have said, if you are there browsing you will find extra stuff and spend more $.

Haven't eaten at the farms restaurant. We went on Mothers Day and the menu seemed a bit pricey.   But, we did shop at the farmers market (bought bread and some produce.) Then we sat down on the picnic tables and had a wonderful brunch eating what we had purchased at the market.   There is a neat art studio towards the back of the farm. Staff was very friendly and helpful.   There is a cool chicken coop that the kids can walk up to, the garden is right by the market which is an education tool for teaching our city kids where food comes from.    This farm inspired my family to put in a large garden and raise 3 chickens in our backyard.   It is great for an early summer morning outing with the family.

Being an avid collector of records, I was excited to find a locally owned record store fairly close to my home.  I must admit I am a pretty loyal customer to Revolver Records (I was introduced by a friend years ago.)  It is the only place I know of for a great selection of records, but all too often I don't have enough time to make that drive on busy weekends.    One Saturday afternoon I was jonesing to buy a few new records and was limited on time so I googled record stores closer to home.  Enter Rockzone records...  A few miles away, I was excited to make a quick visit.  Much smaller in size, I wasn't very impressed by Rockzone's selection, but thought it would be a fun place to come and brouse on a Saturday afternoon.   As I walked in the store, the counter guy was on the phone.  He had brought his kid to work that day and I thought that was cute that the little guy was there helping Dad.  I browsed for a bit (not too impressed by the prices or limited selection) and talked to the kid.  When the Dad got off the phone I went up to ask a question.  I have had a Curtis Matthes stereo for years.  It has served me well, but it is on it's last leg and I am needing something else.  I asked for recommendations.  After all, an employee of a record store, should be knowledgeable about players, right?  Wrong!  He showed me his selection of p.o.s. way over priced used record players, and tried to sell me a new bare bones cheap player for $100.  I later found out he was trying to scam me by asking $40 over the regular retail price.  This guy obviously knew nothing about record players (or thought I knew nothing,) and definitely wasn't interested in my business.  I am always one for shopping local, and was saddened of such horrible service.  Oh well, I will still try to find a place close by who actually wants my business.     You lost out on some decent business Rockzone!

Went here to get my daughter a special outfit for her class recital. I was very disappointed. This store is great if you want to get regular dance clothes (tights, leos, etc.) but you will be paying an arm and a leg for them.   I live in S. Scottsdale and normally go to Barry's Capezio, but I didn't make it by closing time (Dees is open 2 hours later.) However; Dee's wasn't worth my time. I walked out not finding what I was looking for, and I was extremely disappointed by the selection. The staff came out to point to the kids section and then went back into a back room.   I'll be going to back to Barry's Capezio tomorrow. Their selection is much bigger with a better variety, and the prices are at least 1/2 of Dee's Dancewear. The staff is much friendlier at Barry's too.

Went to the Railroad park last summer for a child's birthday party and had a blast. There were kids ranging in age from 1-14 and everyone (including the adults) had a great time. It can get a little pricey for a large family to ride the train, but it is fun.   It is a city park with a neat attraction. Small areas are set up along the track to simulate towns, tunnels, etc.

This place is great for slightly used baby and kids stuff.   Apparently I happened to come into this kid to kid on a good day because I found 2 of the 3 things I was looking for plus an extra (new) item.   The bumbo I was looking for retails in store for almost $50 with a tray. I got the seat, the tray, and a toy that goes with it for $12.99. It looks brand new! I also got a playmat/portable crib (this was the new item) for $40. A steal compared to the original price and what they are selling them for online.   I loved a changing table they had there, but it was a little overpriced for my budget. All the larger furniture items seem a little high for being 2nd hand, but I can always find those somewhere else.   The staff was friendly even though the store was very busy. And I got in and out of there in a timely manner.   I have heard that they are picky about what they will buy.  But, when I overheard the manager talking to a customer on the phone about this, she was very honest and direct with the customer letting them know of their policy.    If you sign up to receive emails you will get some great coupon deals. I will definitely be back.

This place is ok, but not really what I expected from N. Scottsdale. The prices are appropriate for designer shoes in N. Scottsdale, but I didn't find the selection to be all that appealing.   There is a large # of shoes, but there isn't a lot of size options (this place is great if you wear a size 7.) I was getting really agitated and looking at shoes with a gigantic fake flower on the top (heels, boots, sandals- you name it and it had a fake flower on it.)   Not really impressed here. There were a couple of adorable shoes that I would have snatched up at $65 (reg. over $100) but they didn't have it in my size (8 1/2.)   Probably wont be going back. The discount isn't worth looking at so many ugly shoes only to be disappointed that the cute ones aren't in my size. I'll stick with full price- there isn't much of a difference anyways.

After seeing an ad on craigslist for a van I was interested in, I went to Larry Miller Dodge to look at it. The sales staff was extremely helpful and didn't try to up-sell me on anything.   I figured they had this particular van on their lot for a while (purchased in 2009 when the economy was horrible,) but being in great shape and a 2006 I figured it was perfect for my business. I was pleasantly surprised when the quote by the salesman (Gary) was the same one that was posted on-line. Usually they add all kinds of fees once you get there.   The purchase process was quick and painless. Our finance guy was excellent and very professional. They even got us a better deal that what we had originally signed for! What other car dealership gives you a better price than what you have agreed on?   Now, the only reason I am giving it 4 stars is, once we purchased the van we had our mechanic take a look at the vehicle. He told us there were some issues with the brakes, and (Still being under purchase warranty) we took it into the service department to get fixed. Over an hour later, the tech came in and said they didn't find anything wrong with the brakes. So, I ended up taking the vehicle back into my mechanic and had him do the work. But, we got a great deal on the vehicle and the brake work didn't cost us very much. So, all and all I am happy. I just wont take it back to the service center to get any work done on it.   I have now had the vehicle for over 6 months and still have not had one problem with it. I am very happy and pleased. I had to deal with a lot of dealerships before deciding on this one. So, I know, the next time I get a new vehicle I will be coming here 1st.

I took my 6 year old daughter here when it was 115 outside and we had nothing to do.   Boy, do I regret not coming here sooner.  It is reasonably priced, the staff is friendly, the show was fantastic, and there was pre-show crafts where we were able to make our own puppets.    The puppeteer was using marionettes for this show (Rapunzel,) and it was neat to see her show the kids how each one of them worked.  She even explained her stage set up and was very interactive with the kids.  After the show, she put the marionettes down to the kids level so they could get a better look and answered all the questions the kids asked.    The architecture here is amazing.  I have read that this historic building was a church and I am not surprised.  It really is a special place.    I will be taking a group of 2 year old kids tomorrow.  I think they will enjoy it just as much as my 6 year old did.

I am a fan of Halo Piercing.  I have had 3 piercings over the last 10 years and 2 of the 3 have been at Halo.  Had I know about Halo earlier in life I would have got my 1st one there too.    The staff was very professional.  They talked me through the whole thing, step by step. The inside of Halo is cleaner than most doctor's offices and they take pride in their line of work.    The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is that they do not pierce anyone under 18 years old.  This is unfortunate as I called Halo piercing to pierce my 3 year old daughters ears.  I asked if they would do it if I brought in my drivers license and her birth certificate so they would know I was her mother, and they still said no.    I hope that one day they change this policy.  But, I can also respect their professionalism.  I know when my daughter is 14, and goes into Halo to get pierced, they wont do it.   And, that is comforting.

LOVE The Breakfast Club!  I must admit that my whole life was spent going to greasy spoon restaurants for breakfast...  Until I met a friend who is an interior designer.  She suggested that I get away from my backwoods grass roots and go to brunch somewhere that has "real" food.    The only reasons why it got 4 instead of 5 stars: Going to The Breakfast Club for Saturday brunch is not a good idea when you are starving.  Chances are you will have about a 30+ minute wait, but the wait is well worth it.  Also, you can't sit on the patio and drink alcohol.  Which really sucked when after a 45 minute wait we were seated, handed our menu's, got comfortable, and then were told that we had to move inside if we were going to drink mimosas.  This was the only bad experience in the 10+ times we have been there since.  Good:  When we walked into The Breakfast Club, I could see why my interior designer friend loves this place.  Simplistic design keeps it clean and feeling uncrowded, even when every seat in the house is full (and this place can hold a LOT of people for its size.)  The food is amazing, and although I have tasted other items on the menu I order the biscuits and gravy and a mimosa or two every time we go.  The staff is cute, friendly and attentive and everything is a decent price.

I want to send a big THANK YOU to Prestige Car wash!  Last Saturday I took my van in to get washed.  The place was packed!  There was at least 20 cars ahead of me but I thought I'd give it a try anyways.    The worker who met me at my car started the conversation by asking me if I had brought him a "clean or dirty car."  Who brings a clean car to the car wash?    I opened the back door and told him I wanted a wash a vacuum.  He looked inside and told me it would be $99.95.  I responded with "I dont want a detail, I want a wash and vacuum."    He proceeded to tell me that he couldn't do that for me.  He said that because I take my dog on road trips the hair from my dog had gotten into the fiber of my carpet and it would need to be detailed to get out.  After arguing with him for 10 minutes and telling him I am always able to vacuum my dogs hair out of the carpet very easily.  He said "WELL THEN, GOOD LUCK WITH THAT!" and walked away.    I was actually turned away from a place that I was willing to pay $ to! So, feeling very rejected and embarrased, I took my car to a self wash.  I ended up paying $8.50 (I even bought smell good Cherry Spray,) and competely vacuumed, washed, and armoralled my car myself in less than 30 minutes.    So, Thank you Prestige Auto!  You not only saved me over $10, my car looks better than I would have expected it to look from getting it cleaned at your establishment.    The other reviews are correct, this place is horrible.  I dont understand why there were so many other patrons here on that day.  Perhaps it is because people like to throw $ away, as well as be abused and embarrassed by a business who proudly treats their customers like crap!    I'm sure they get the majority of their business from 1st time patrons using their coupons, but I doubt many people come back.

I love Barry's Capezio! My daughter (5 years old) recently started taking dance classes. Barrys was right down the street from my home, so I stopped in for tights and a leotard. The staff was unbelievably friendly. They treat you like a long time customer. They were very helpful in finding the right ballet shoes for my daughter. The merchandise is of great quality, and they have a huge selection.   I have gone to other dance-wear shops and none can compare.   Barry's Capezio has been in business for over 20 years and I can see why. I will be going back tomorrow to get my daughter one of their beautiful tutus for her class recital.

This place sucks! Your helpful place? I think not. I have lived in S. Scottsdale for 4 years now and have been to ace a total of 6 times. The first 4 were Farly pleasant and the staff was helpful, although they didn't go out of their way (I have had better help by the 16 year old at Lowes.)   But, this past week I have gone into Ace Hardware 2 times. The first time I asked the door greater for help on a ceiling fan part (I needed to replace the pull switch on the light kit- he pointed me to the light bulb isle. I know I am a girl, but I was not looking for that kind of repair. I found my own way to the electrical isle, figured out what I needed, and paid.   Then unfortunately I had to go back to get a second part (I tried Lowes first, but they didn't have it.) I didn't even bother to ask for help this time. I found what I needed and went to check out. After standing in a very long line, I made my way to the cashier. While I was in mid sentence asking her opinion on replacing the part, the phone rang. She didn't hesitate to completely ignore me and pick up the phone. She stayed on the phone with that customer until the transaction was complete and I walked out.   Now, if it were a big box store, I would expect that kind of service, but for a company who's slogan is about customer service, I was very disappointed. I will not go back to Ace hardware again.

Went to Midas to get an oil change. My 1st time in years going to a new mechanic. My ex got my old mechanic in the divorce (his cousin.) But, I figured since Midas was a large chain I would be ok. They wouldn't ruin their reputation would they?   I spent over $50 for an oil change- one that took over an hour and I was the only customer there. Then they came in telling me I needed a new air filter- that was going to cost me $60 to replace, and I needed new brake discs, drums, rotors, etc. and the price would be over $850. They advised me that I needed it done right away and that it would be dangerous if I didn't. When I turned them down they called me at home the next week telling me their main office was wiling to give me a 20% discount if I had it done that week... RED FLAG!   I decided to take my chances until I yelped a good mechanic- after all, my brakes seemed ok.. Today, almost 2 months later- because I had to save the $, I took my car to Gene's auto (thanks yelpers for your reviews) Gene said I had 50-60% of my brakes left and I wouldn't need it to be replaced for quite some time. SCREW YOU MIDAS!   Now what to do with my extra $800?

In my opinion, Defalcos has the best Italian food hands down. My family has tried other local Italian restaurants and we always end up coming back.   Their Fettuccine Alfredo is to die for. And, I disagree with a previous statement about the garlic bread. I always order extra to take home. The portions are huge, so order 1/2 order if you don't want to take any home. Their clam chowder is also very, very good. But isn't always available.   I have friends in Awatukee that drive into town on weekends specifically to eat here.   They have a great wine and beer selection, we always like to purchase 2 bottles of wine.  Drink 1 with dinner, and take the other 1 home.     Calling ahead of time is recommended, because as others have said, the wait can get pretty long due to overcrowding of the restaurant. But, if you are looking for a fun, friendly atmosphere, this is the place. They have magazines out front and newspapers, so it is fun to go and people watch while waiting for your food. And remember... the workers are true Italians, so sometimes you might catch an argument, or someone giving a customer grief. Its all part of the experience and fun.

4 stars for the beer and atmosphere!  2-3 stars for the food.  I was scouring yelp trying to find a fun place to take some out of town friends who were here from Indiana.  I wanted to show them some fun in our spring desert.  I finally decided on Four Peaks.  Park on the street and it is a quick walk.  Saw that a few cars had recently been broken into as there was a lot of glass on the side of the street, but we didn't have any issues.  The patio was very nicely shaded, and with a slight breeze on a March afternoon it was perfect weather.  I was surprised that we didn't have to wait to get seated on a very busy day.  The waitress was attentive (at first) but slacked once we ordered our drinks.  It was a busy Saturday afternoon and we were having a good time, so the slow service didn't bother me.  I tried the Kilt Lifter and a friend tried the stout and both were delicious.  They have a "full bar" but they don't have blended drinks.  A friend ordered a cosmo that she said was decent.  Later that evening I found the kilt lifter on tap at a local bar, so it was an added bonus to be able to drink the same beer all day.    The food was mediocre.  If there wasn't so much grease on EVERYONE'S food it would have been a lot better.  I ordered the turkey club on marble rye, and the bread was too greasy/buttery to enjoy.  A few friends ordered burgers and fries that they enjoyed after using there napkin to soak up some of the grease.  I will try to jalapeno popper burger next time and will ask them to not add butter or toast the bun.  Someone else in my group ordered pizza which came out hot and looked like very fresh ingredients were used.  We ordered the nachos as an appetizer and they were just ok.  Big plates made it possible for almost everyone to take extras home.  All in all, we had a good time.  The beer and the atmosphere is why I will return to Four Peaks on a sunny afternoon.

Oh Green Restaurant, how I love thee...  I tried Green restaurant for the first time about a year ago.  As a vegetarian who was starving for some good food, I picked up a Green menu one day (dont know where I got it) and starting salavating at the menu options.  Lots and lots of options.    The first time I went I tried the po-boy sand.  It was good, but I wasnt too impressed as I could make something similar myself.  My daughter tried the crap puffs, and although she didnt like them (she's a true blue meat eater and knows the difference) I loved them.  Crisp, fried, deliciousness.  Their salads are delicious and their mock chicken anything is very good.  They even have chili fries- yummy!  Havent tried the soynami shakes.  I am always too full when I leave there to even think about dessert, but after reading the reviews I will have to try one now.

Ok, went and got the TSoynami blizzard... loved it!  It is made with soy so the ice cream has a little bit of a nutty flavor.  Went a safe route and got the cookies and cream made with Newman's Os.  It was delicious!  They have a whole menu (front and back) of blizzard flavors, and you can customize if you want.  Best of all, my 6 year old said it was better than Dairy Queen.  Yeah!!!

Jims is a great place to go and get a greasy down home breakfast. The staff is great. We always make sure to sit in the same place to get our usual waitress.   Once you've gone a few times the waitress will ask you your name and will remember you the next time you go. We always go here for Mothers Day, which is alot of fun because I always get hugs from the staff. Haven't been in a while because I am trying to lose weight and this isn't the place to go to do so. But, one day I will be back, and I can guarantee they will remember me.   The only downside to this restaurant is the bathrooms. They are gross! And, of course, every time we go my 5 year old has to use them. We have gotten used to them though and tolerate it because we love the friendliness of the staff.   We have taken our family there for breakfast when they come in from out of town and they love it here too. It has a small town feel.   We have had large groups of 20 people, and they have a backroom that was perfect for that.

Went to jobing.com arena to see the Coyotes play hockey for the 2nd time in 2 years.   They had a great deal for girl scouts ($19 for 200 level, $31 for lower,) so my daughter and I decided to go.   We had a great time once we made our way up to the top level and got in our seats. We were treated poorly when we tried to take the escalator up and didn't realize it was for the box seats, but that usher seemed to have a stick up his butt anyways- old man took his job way too seriously.   The price of food was a bit high, but I did notice there were meal deals which seemed pretty reasonable for game food.   I have been 6 rows from the ice and now in row G of the 200 level. I would definitely splurge next time for the lower seats, but we still had great views.   After the game, my daughter and I were allowed to go on the ice and take a slap shot. A great experience, and everyone (except for the grumpy old man) was very helpful and nice.   Side note: Go to HowlersDen.com and sign up for the Howlers Kids Club. With a $15 membership your kids get lots of fun trinkets, but best of all you get 2 seat vouchers (good for $30 seats in upper row.)

With a mobster feeling upon entering through the kitchen, red leather booths, red velvet wallpaper, and my friend telling me how popular this place was for politicos back in the day, my imagination ran away with me picturing Durants full of politicians and their beautiful wives getting totally smashed on martinis and smoking their cigarettes looking bored while the men talked politics.   So in the spirit of the restaurant I decided to order the vodka martini and holy cow did I get hammered. Now, I have to be fair and admit that I am not one to hold my liquor and it probably didn't help that I had 5 glasses of wine before I went, but the martinis here- although good, are lethal. If someone had lite a match next to me I probably would have combusted.   My friend and I couldn't decide on a main entree so we decided to order 3 appetizers. The crab cake- VERY good, the spinach dip- also good, but similar to most places, and the seafood sampler- oysters and shrimp were good but the crab was obviously frozen and tasted horrible.   We told our waiter that the crab was bad, and he commented that the crab wasn't in season until the end of the month- which we understood, but were still disappointed that it was even on the menu. We had eaten the shrimp and oyster 1st wanting to save the crab for last and immediately sent it away when we tasted it. Truthfully, it made me sick to my stomach- or maybe it was the liquor that did it. Anyways, the manager came out and said he was going to comp us over $20 for the crab. That was very decent of him, although I am pretty ruined from trying the crab here ever again. I think I will probably play it safe by ordering the chicken or steaks next time.   I left Durants with a smile on my face and a stumble in my step. A little lighter in my pockets- this place is pricy, but Overall, a great night.

I accidentally stumbled upon Last Chance looking for another store, and I had to share my experience on Yelp.   I walked into the store and saw a small indoor mall, took the escalator down and stumbled upon a mess of ravenous women who were on a mission to get as many pairs of children's shoes as possible. I heard a loud voice screaming over the crowd (by a worker) "EVERYONE STEP AWAY FROM THE SHOES AND DON'T TOUCH THEM UNTIL WE RESTOCK!"   I have to admit that at this point I was scared, but intrigued at what was inside this store that would cause these woman to behave in this manner.   Now, I will admit, there were some amazing finds. I saw very high end designer shirts for less than $10. But, I have to agree with other 2 star reviews in that these clothes are pretty gross.   I probably will not return. For those of you who have not been and are reading reviews, the best I can compare this mad house is a 50% off sale at Goodwill. But, about 50 times worse. I have also seem similar behavior on Christmas eve at grocery stores in Mexico (and in a Food City in downtown Phoenix) by the meat department.   You have to be a pretty dedicated shopaholic to deal with these crazy women.     P.S.- Parking is terrible in this shopping mall.

I love this mall.  I agree with other postings that you need to look your best when you go to this mall.  I have been a few times with normal clothes on and I dont get the service or attention as I do when I doll myself up.  I love going to this mall when I have a few extra hundred dollars to spend on myself.  I also go when I want an extra special outfit.   It is high end and the prices are much more expensive than if you go to a regular mall, but the stores are more high end as well.  The best time to go (if you are $ conscious) is at the end of the season.  I went a few weeks ago with a friend and got 2 dress shirts, a workout outfit, and earrings for my daughter for less than $100.  All on clearance, but higher end items that I wouldnt be able to find at most department stores.    You definetly want to park underground or in the parking lot of the larger stores, because the above ground can get pretty bad.

Oh My God!  This is the best Italian food I have ever eaten!  Seriously!  This is going to be food that I crave.  I went here last night, to meet my boyfriends son.  So, it was ideal that we meet at a pretty special but "kid friendly" (I'd call if more family style) place.  When we got there at 7:00 on a Sunday, we were told there was a 30 minute wait, but a table opened up in the bar and we were able to grab it and be served right away.  I was told the portions were big so I decided to share with my 8 year old.  Much to my delight, I found out there was a selection of the menu where you could mix and match pastas and take a 2nd order home at the end of your meal.  We ordered the spaghetti with meat sauce (my 8 year old's choice) and decided to take the Eggplant parmesean home.  My boyfriend and his son got the lasagna which I tried and it was incredible.  The spaghetti was good and there was a lot leftover even though we shared.  The waitress was great and attentive to our needs even though the place was packed and we were there for over 2 hours just enjoying each others company.  As were were finishing up, one of the cooks came out from the back to visit with a friend that had come in for dinner.  He was short, stocky, bald, jovial, and loud- a real Italian.  No wonder his food is so good!    The next day, I almost ate the eggplant for breakfast but I controlled myself until about 11:30.  I can't believe how good it was.  Refrigerated overnight and nuked and it was still incredible.  I cant imagine how good it has to be fresh out of the oven.  If Valentine's Day wasn't 3 days away I'd suggest we go back here for dinner.  It is a north Scottsdale restaurant that is comfortable and classy.  Dress up or dress down, it doesn't matter.  It is just comfortable.    Some things I noticed....  There is valet parking by the front door, but there is plenty of public parking too.  They have take out.  It is a good idea to make a reservation.  Sitting in the bar is just fine vs. a long wait for a table (although I didn't go in the back and see the restaurant.)  They host big parties- weddings, anniversaries, etc.  AND, the coolest thing, they hold cooking classes the last Thursday of the month.  I think I dropped enough (pretty straight forward) hints to my b.f. that I thought it would be a fantastic Thursday date night.  We will see how it goes. :)

I love Changing Hands Bookstore! Especially around the holidays. They sell much more than books. The staff is friendly and helpful. They always have book readings and signings. There is a monthly schedule posted in the bookstore.   My 5 year old loves coming here to the kids section. Although it is pricey, they have a better selection of kids books than most box stores.   I usually find at least 5 non-book gift for family and friends during the holidays.   Warning: if you are going to Changing Hands Bookstore from far away, it may be a good idea to call 1st and make sure there isn't a "famous" Author Signing.   I went once when a politician was there. It was a mess! I had a special order book to p/u and when they called to tell me that the book was in, they failed to mention that it wouldn't be a good idea to p/u that day. I had to have my purse searched and left by the front door, secret service was there, and it took me over 45 minutes to get in and out with my $5 paperback book.   The parking can get a little hectic during popular book signings too, so if you are going during a book signing get there early.

So Sad!    I went to Cafe Carumba for the 1st time this weekend, and was VERY excited  to sit and the bar to drink and eat until my hearts content.  But it didn't happen because the owners of Cafe Carumba decided they didn't need to pay rent.  There was a nasty note on the door from the property manager, and most of the things in the restaurant were cleaned out.      My only hope is that these guys will get their act together (and their finances) and open a new one.    Oh well, I got drunk anyways.

Amazing Jakes is GROSS! And, I don't just mean the food, the filth, and the broken games.   This place is a pedophile's dream! It is used as a babysitting service to countless amounts of teens and preteens (even saw a few unattended kids who couldn't have been over 8) with NO security service provided. The teens who work here are not qualified to handle a serious situation.   If you have never been to this dive, picture the kiddie area at the state fair put indoors, add a small bowling alley and you have Amazing Jakes.   As for you grown men who go there to hang out- GROSS! And to the adult couples who go there on a date- WEIRD!   I saw very few involved parents. Most of the parents who actually were there looked like teenager mothers hanging out with their friends.   Prepare to pay a minimum of $20 for dinner and games. Long lines for the rides are inevitable (we waited over an hour to drive the race cars.) And 1/3-1/2 of the arcade games are broken.   Save your $ and don't waste your time. Your kids will have a much better time somewhere else.   Because of extremely long lines, faulty equipment, and rude unsupervised children, my daughter walked away disappointed by the whole experience.

Thumbs down AZ Republic.   You wrote a horrible article (my 5 year old could have done better,) missed every main point possible, used my name throughout your stupid article, then allowed every no-life jerk to post horrible comments about me!   I HATE YOU AZ REPUBLIC! I hope all your newspapers spontaneously combust and burns your building to the ground.   But, that wont have to happen, because your newspaper is going downhill and going fast. Hopefully, you will be bankrupt within the next year.   If I want to see bad reporting I'll get a free New Times. At least they have the decency to throw in some humor with their crap fest called journalism.  P.S.- how many times do I have to tell you to stop calling me?!?  I don't want to subscribe to your stupid newspaper- even if you do give me a gift certificate to Target!

I rarely admit it in public, but I will for those of you who have lived in Yuma for any period of time...  I am a Yuma native.  I know, most people think that Yuma sucks, and quite honestly I agree to an extent.  I mean, there is a reason why I left.    Now to get to the point of my public admission...  There are 2 fast food and 1 sit down restaurants in Yuma that anyone who has lived there for more than a few months loves.  I won't say the names b/c I am afraid Yelp will remove my review, but those restaurants are owned by the Gutierrez family.  Seriously, Yumans ship their bean and cheese burritos all over the world to other Yuma natives.  It is a stop that most make when they go back to visit.   And why have I been talking about Yuma?  Carolina's has got to be a near relative of the family who owns those restaurants.  Or at least originated from the same town in Mexico, because this is the closest thing that I have found to that, VERY FAMOUS among Yumans, restaurants.  Maybe I have been gone too long, but I think that Carolinas may be a little better.  The bean and cheese burritos taste exactly the same, and the salsa is close (Carolinas is better/thicker.)  The machacha meat is near the same taste too, and the folded tacos are identical.  The rolled tacos aren't as good at Carolina's but it is the same taco that you would get in any Mexican household on the border of San Luis, Somerton, or Algadones. The rice is different too, similar but I had it once and I think there was corn in it. Carolinas has a bigger menu and offers more than its Yuma competitors.    Now, Carolinas isn't for everyone.  Living on the border nearly my whole life and being fed by friend's parents who were Mexico natives (some illegals,) my palate has been refined by traditional Mexican food from the northwest border of Mexico.  I have hard a hard time finding what I would consider good Mexican food here in Phoenix, because it seems to be a smorgasbord of cuisine from all of Mexico.   So, if you grew up near the southwest border, give Carolinas a try.  You may find that you wont have to drive the 3 hours home when you get a hankering for a bean and cheese or a machaca burrito.    FYI:  Everytime I have been there it is crazy busy.  So if you are planning on going during lunchtime, dinnertime, or on weekends, plan accordingly and make sure that someone stands and waits for a table while the other people in your group place an order.  Also, true to the Mexican restaurant style...  The tables will probably be dirty so bring some disinfectant wipes if you have issues, don't look at how dirty the floor is, and don't pay mind to the spilt salsa at the self serve salsa station, or the ice that has been dumped all over the machine.  We have been in there quite a few times where there was more ice spilt than actually in the machine.  Consider in ambiance.  This staff is swamped with customers at meal times and it is your fellow patrons that make it that dirty.

I visited Gene today to have quite a few things done to my car, and I couldn't wait to get home to write this review.   I went to Gene because of all of the positive yelper reviews- Thanks guys!   I too was not disappointed by his service. I called 1st to schedule an appt which I recommend to anyone because this shop was very busy. But Gene got us in right away.   I told Gene that I definitely needed my tires rotated and balanced, but I also needed estimates for quite a few things- thanks to a few other mechanics I had visited who all "found" major issues with my car.   Gene looked over my whole car for free. Found out that the other mechanics were trying to screw me, and found that I did need my transmission fluid and filter changed- but gave me a great price for it- way less than competitors. He also didn't try to push it on me, just told me I needed it done soon.   Gene was very helpful in answering all of my questions. His staff was excellent- his front desk girl is his daughter and is very sweet. Everyone greeted me with a smile and no one seemed bothered by my 4 kids and I taking over the waiting room,   But, I was most impressed by his customer service to his returning clients. A few whom he recognized right away when they walked in the door. All, who seemed very happy to be returning to him. I too will be happy to return my car to him.

Had to call Roto Rooter (note to self- don't leave the 2 year old in the bathroom with baby wipes while being potty trained.) They were very quick on getting to my home. Took about 1 hour from the time I called, and they were 15 minutes earlier than expected.   The guy was fairly friendly. Obviously hadn't had his coffee yet though. But, if it was my job to handle peoples feces all day I wouldn't be very chipper either.   All in all, the job was done well. It only took him about 45 minutes to find the problem and clear the drains. He did leave a pretty big mess for me to clean up. I would have added at least 1 more star had I not had to clean up after the kid, the backed up drains, and him.   Ended up paying $230 for the job.  Hope I wont need plumbing services again for a while, but next time I'll check with yelp 1st to see if there is a better plumbing company out there.

Went to Sprinkles one day after buying a new car. Was worried about parking because I had read reviews, so I parked in the back of the lot where there was plenty of parking.   My family of 3 got 1/2 dz. I'm partial to the black and white and never stray. The rest of the family got the red-velvet, pumpkin, and vanilla. Then we sat in the parking lot and watched the joggers go by on the canal while we pigged out on Sprinkles.   We ended up taking 3 extras home, they definitely aren't as good the next day, but they warn you about that.   Their packaging is part of the allure, and they have the cutest little wooden forks so you can eat your cupcake right away without making too much of a mess.   This is a fun place to go with the family on a Saturday afternoon. Although it is crazy to see how bent up people get when the person in front of them takes the last of a specific flavor. I have even caught myself counting how many black and white cupcakes are left vs. people ahead of me. They are that good!   These are great for b-day gifts, baby showers, etc. I have a friend who purchased Sprinkles Cupcakes as an "I'm Sorry" gift when she accidentally broke her best friends foot. Nothing says I'm sorry like fattening deliciousness.

This review is to all parents!   Papago Park is going to crap! What happened to Papago over the past few months? Maybe since it is summer the city's staff isn't taking as good of care of the grounds as they should, but there was dangerous broken playground equipment, all kinds of trash in the sand, and the general upkeep of the playground was horrible.   BTW: I just have to say, Papago park gave me the creeps today. It was completely empty other than a few shady guys in the parking lot that I am pretty sure were doing a drug deal. I wont be going to Papago Park again.   I like to hike there (just N. of McDowell,) but I don't feel this park is a safe place for my kids to go and play anymore.

I was shocked at another review that said the sales people were pushy and rude. I had quite the opposite experience and have found my new place to shop for unique toys.   I went to Brilliant Sky because they had a few guest artists doing portraits and silhouettes. When we walked in the door we were greeted by a gentleman who was very kind and whom directed us to the corners of the store where the artists were. Did I mention he was very cute! Nice eye candy for the moms! :)   We spend over 2 1/2 hours in Brilliant Sky today. Less than 1/2 hour was used for pictures, the rest of the time my 5 year old and my friends 2 year old played. They had a great time! My 5 year old played with puppets that were on the shelves, the 2 year old emptied a bin of Frisbees and lined them all up on the floor, I accidentally dropped a shelf full of toys on the ground, and no one said a thing. They were very kind and friendly, always talking to the kids and smiling at them. The staff was very helpful in finding me age appropriate toys that would teach the 2 year old colors, and no one ever told the kids they weren't allowed to touch or play with stuff in the store.   I was very impressed, so much so, that I will drive from S. Scottsdale to Brilliant Sky every time I am looking for a unique toy. It was a lot of fun for all of us.   I ended up walking out of the store with over $75 worth of things. Not too bad considering the quality of toys that I got. I did take my time shopping and I only bought the toys that I felt were reasonably priced, but I am very happy with my selections.   They are a bit pricier than Amazon, but I feel that it is worth the extra fee to have my child try it out first. I did only do 4 stars because of the cost of things, but I am a big fan of Brilliant Sky now.   I found it very cool that they hand out customer cards (similar to grocery stores) and for every purchase you make you get points (I believe it is based on the amount of toys you purchase) and for every 30 loyalty points you get $15 off.   There return policy is limited. 60 days with a receipt if the item has not been opened or is defective.

This Museum is AMAZING! I have never seen anything like it before.   I love the mock grocery store and pizzeria. It seemed to be my kids favorite too. We had such a great time that both kids (18 months and 4 years) had a sensory overload.   Everything is adult friendly too, so parents can have a lot of fun pretending with their kids. What an amazing time!   I wish that the prices were a bit cheaper, but understand due to the complexity of all the exhibit as well as the maintenance it must take to keep everything in working order. I would love to see a membership program with more reasonable rates.

I love this place!  Seriously, I grew up with a best friend whose Mom is Vietnamese(,came to the states with her American husband) and the little old lady who owns/runs this place reminds me of her.  Growing up I was always given advice like, "you drink lots of milk and you wont be fat."  She always had food cooking, and the smells of her house were so unique.  My favorite thing about Vietnamese mothers is that they dote on their children while complaining.  I was always spending the night at her house, and when I would wake up, my clothes from the night before would be washed, starched, ironed (including my undies,) and everything would be folded in individual ziplock baggies.  Meanwhile we would get yelled at that she was always having to work hard to take care of us, and lord help her husband if he made her mad.  I swear Vietnamese mothers are awesome!  Any who, this lady is just as cool.  My first visit here was with a friend who lives down the street and recommended it.  We ordered it to go and were told it would take about 20 minutes.  So, we went and had a beer (or 3) at the dive bar in the same shopping complex and we went back minutes before the closing time.  As we walked it, it felt like a blast from the past.  The little old lady was complaining "you order too much soup!  I had to make more soup because you order too much soup!"  "Oh, I so tired!" "I make SO much soup today!" I knew right there that I was going to love this place.   The Chicken Pho comes in separate containers to keep the herbs fresh.  The chicken is separate from the broth and you get to mix it all together according to your like.  I usually can not eat all of it in 1 sitting.  The Goi Cuon, pork and shrimp salad rolls are delicious (I order an extra peanut sauce to dip.)  The fried spring rolls are good too (although the sauce that comes with them I don't like,) and I have had the fried rice and it is delicious and moist.  The crab puffs aren't very good, I wont ever order those again, but everything else I have ventured to try has been delicious.  Pho ranges in price from around $6.50-7.50, most Chinese meal combos are $8.50, and I think the salad rolls are around $6.   The little old lady doesn't always complain at her customers, and when she does she isn't mean.  One time I went in, and she was complaining about her new waitress.  Telling me how hard it is to train "new help."  She will get over it fast and she will give you a genuine smile as you leave.  This is a locally owned Mom and Pop restaurant in a strip mall.  No frills, but they have been here for a while and seem to genuinely appreciate your business, even if they do complain a little.  We really did order too much soup.  Ate it for every meal for 2 days.

I took my van in to get my gas tank filled up and a regular wash with vaccuum.  After talking to the guy who met me at my car I decided to go for the full works.  I said go ahead and detail it.  Now, I had a meeting to go to, so I made sure that it wasnt going to take anymore than 1 hour to complete, and the worker assured me it wouldnt.  So, I turned over my keys and went shopping.  1 hour later I returned.  My car was not done!  In fact, it had only been washed and vaccumed.  So, I talked to the manager and got a vouchure to come back another day and get it finished.  The next day I returned.  I asked to speak to a manager to complain about the time frame, as well as the fact that in an hour my car had not been cleaned.  I was assured by 2 young men (who came up to me and acted like they were managers) that I would be pleased with the end results.  Almost 2 hours later I was told my car was finished.  But, when I got out to my car, i was astonished to find that it was not cleaned any better than a quick wash and vacuum would have done.  The floors were wet, so they obviously cleaned the carpets, but I found spots that had been missed everywhere!  Now, I am a very clean person.  My friends always compliment me on how clean my home is, but my car can get pretty dirty (i have 5 kids and a dog that ride in it daily.)  So, as I looked around I noticed that the door jams where the sliding van doors open and close had not been cleaned, neither had the a/c vents.  I found a toy under one of the seats, a snack wrapper under another.  Nothing had been cleaned to detail!  I paid over $120 for the detail and gas, and felt that I could have filled up my tank and done a better job at cleaning the car for 1/2 that.    So, I decided to email the corporate office of Dannys.  I explained the situation and many days later I received a response email.  It basically said that because that person from corporate was not at the location they do not know what happened.  They appologized for it and offered me a regular wash and vacuum.  Are you kidding me?!?  What happened to customer satisfaction?  So what if corporate was not there!  I took the time out to send an email because I was so dissatisfied, that should be proof enough!    Needless to say, I never accepted that coupon, nor will I return to Danny's auto wash.  Prior to this incident I had been to other locations and found the staff friendly and they got the job done to my satisfaction everytime.  However, due to the experience I had at the Tempe location, as well as the experience with the corporate office I will not patron any Danny's locations in the valley.

Is it better than your average fast food place? Yes. Is it the best BBQ ever? No way!   But Dickeys food is decent. Food is cheap Ribs and pulled pork are good, rolls and okra- darn good.   Went in the other day because I didn't want to cook, and after watching "Super Size Me'" about a month ago, I stay away from the obvious "fast food" restaurants completely. So, craving some red meat I went to Dickeys for take out because it was close and I figured their food wouldn't be as processed as McD's- seriously that movie gave me nightmares.   The staff was super friendly, the football game was on TV., the food was done quickly- giving me enough time to make myself a root beer float and watch AZ lose in OT- :(   For 3 of us I ordered the ribs, the turkey, coleslaw, mac and cheese, fried okra, potato casserole, and 2 rolls.   When I got home I was disappointed to see that the turkey looked like processed poo on a plate. Really guys- picture slimy poo on a plate-it was that gross! I refused to taste it, and everyone else was brave enough to at least try it, only to decide they couldn't eat more than 1 bite- but the dog thought it was delicious.   Never tried the potato casserole because Dickeys forgot to pack it. The mac and cheese was gross! I'm not a salt person, but it definitely needed salt and pepper to give it flavor and the macaroni was over cooked to that gross slimy noodle consistency.   So, the 3 of us shared 4 ribs, okra, and an individual size coleslaw with 2 rolls- one person was hungry enough to go ahead and eat the mac and cheese even though he didn't like it.   Dickeys would have gotten 1 star but the ribs and okra were pretty darn good and I made one hell of a root beer float while I was there.   I may be seen in Dickeys again because I have a fondness for fried okra and I have tried their pulled pork Sandwiches before and liked it. But I will definitely check my takeout before I leave to make sure it is all there and I will never order the mac and cheese or processed turkey poo again.

Great simple sushi place!  Not a whole lot of frills, not a wide "authentic" selection, but perfect if you want a quick, simple meal.    No Sushi bar- it's more like a good fast food Sushi restaurant.  Serves other food as well- but have never tried anything else.    Place closes at 7- I have always went there for (take out) diner right before they close, and there is always someone trying to get in after hours.

Living in S. Scottsdale, I had never heard of George's Famous Gyros.  When a friend suggested Greek food, I remembered there was a new place in the Papago Center on the corner of McDowell and Scottsdale Road.  Well, come to find out that place is also called George's Gyros (without the famous.)  Sounded shady to me and seems like that place is trying to steal business from the original.  So, we took the extra few minutes to make sure to google and get the right place.     It was my 1st time eating lamb as guilt always took precedence over the deliciousness of a baby animal.  But, when my friend insisted that we order take out I finally gave in. I ordered a Greek salad (instead of fries) along with a kabob and just in case I didn't like lamb, a side of (cant remember name) rice rolled in a grape leaf.   We placed our order over the phone and after 20 minutes we went and picked it up.  It was ready and hot.  George told us there was only about 20% lamb and the rest was beef.  The whole meal was delicious.  There was plenty of leftovers for a 2nd meal.  I will definitely be back to George's FAMOUS Gyros.

This farm is amazing!   I was a fan of the Farmer's Market in Downtown Phoenix, and a big fan of the Farm at South Mountain (still am) but when it comes down to it, nothing can beat Singh farms. Now, I know what your thinking... Better than downtown Phoenix, and South Mountain? I have to tell you, it is way better!   Ken Singh is the owner, and he is an amazing guy. I went today to look at his compost (he sells it by the bag full/truck full) and maybe p/u a few fresh produce. Ken Singh walks around the property and greets all of his customers. At times, I saw people standing in line waiting to talk to him. He makes everyone feel welcomed as if they were personally invited.   When I pulled into the drive (On Thomas- just east of the 101) it was a whole new atmosphere. The soil is so rich, I could feel my tires digging into the ground.   You can purchase seeds, starter plants, fresh produce, breads, cookies and pastries, homemade butter, homemade hummus, spices, tie-dye aprons, and more. As the produce runs out, more is picked from the fields and brought into the store.   There was even a restaurant (I believe the name of the restaurant is Aurore) who came out to the farm and prepared amazing brisket sandwiches right on the property. She even cooked the meat in Ken Singh's mud oven. The food was so delicious, (everyone there agreed) and did I mention FREE, that my company went back for seconds.   We toured the property and saw chickens, peacocks, a real tee-pee, and rows upon rows of delicious fruit and vegetables. You are welcome to roam the property and we spend 1 1/2 hours just looking at everything.   When all was said and done, and as I was dragging my heals to leave this amazing place, I purchased Swiss Chard, a huge head of romaine lettuce, a bunch of carrots, Green onions, and 2 huge burlap sacks full (at least 60-70 lbs a piece) of the best composted soil amendment I have ever seen, I only spent just over $30.   My companion purchased a cookie as big as your head, bread, and butter for less than $15.   When I pulled out of the drive with all of my goodies in tow, there was Ken Singh once more to see us off. He shook my hand, talked to us for a minute more, then waived and smiled as we drove off. I truly felt like one of his guests and will continue to attend this lovely gathering every Saturday morning from 9 am-1 pm for years to come.   Now, I have to tell you, that I was hesitant to even post this review. Ken Singh's farm is ran strictly by word of mouth. He even sells shirts that have his logo, but nowhere will you find the name of his farm on them. And, I know, the more people who hear about this amazing farm, the less my chance of getting top quality veggies. But this farm is too good to not share with my fellow yelpers. A true diamond in the rough.   Buy the way they accept cash and check only. I found some items to be a little pricey but totally worth the extra dollar. The cost is definitely comparable, if not cheaper, than S. Mountain or Downtown Phoenix's Farmers Markets, and there is no sales tax because it is on the Indian reservation.

Arcadia Tavern, I have been enjoying dinner at your place for quite some time.  Over a year I have been coming over to your place, not only for the great atmosphere of being a kid friendly sports bar, but also for those greasy burgers and delicious sweet potato tots.  Seriously, those things are so addictive my family and I count out how many each person gets so everyone has the same amount and there aren't any fights.  Then, as if you cant get any better, you start showing up on localdines.com and groupon.com.  Holy cow, I can come to your place for 1/2 price?  AWSOME!!!  But then, you start becoming a crappy host.  The last few months you have screwed up my order nearly every time I go.  Seriously, I write down on a piece of paper what I want on my burger (make it very clear and in pen) and you still mess it up?  I write mushrooms and you don't add them, twice.  My delicious sweet potato tots come out burnt on time, cold another time and without seasoning.  Then you forget to add the cheese to my burger, and it comes out rare when I clearly marked medium/well.  Did I mention you hostesses lately have been awful?  Is the job requirement to be dumb and/or rude, or are you just not training them?  But, despite your faults I love you and I am hopeful you are just going thru a phase.  So yesterday 7/29/14 I come back with a group of friends in tow and very hungry.  Groupon in hand and excited to stuff myself with tots.  As I pull into the drive, I realize something is wrong.  VERY WRONG.  Was I there on a day you were closed?  No, I have been here on Tuesday nights before.  Why aren't the valet boys running out to my car to park it in your normally very crowded parking lot?  Then I notice it.... A closed for renovations sign.  WHAT!?!?!  But I have a groupon!  Why are you selling groupons (good until August 19th) when you are closed for renovations?  I was just there about a week ago, why didn't you put up signs that you were going to close temporarily?  Why doesn't your closed for renovations sign tell me when you are re-opening?  did you screw me over via groupon?     Arcadia Tavern, I like you a whole lot and I appreciate you are trying to change things, but I am feeling that you are being a really crappy friend.  Are we going to have to end our relationship?

I was introduced to this place a few months back, and have been a few times. We drive from Tempe (by ASU) to Lin's about once a month and feel the long drive is worth it. I love the Sushi here. There is always someone behind the counter making it fresh, so I watch to see what has just been put out. The "regular" Chinese food is ok. I have had better, but for a buffet, and less than $10/person it is good. It is interesting to look around because there is alot of unusual dishes that I am not as familiar with. Have seen lots of different octopus items. So, if you like unusual Chinese cuisine this is the place for you. There is a pizza bar, french fries, and chicken nuggets if your kids don't eat Chinese food. There is also a Mongolian grill, and a steak grill. Both of which I have not tried but plan on trying the Mongolian grill the next time I go.   I have heard the lunch buffet is tastier than the dinner, but I have not been there for lunch.   I noticed the floors were not very clean, and there were dishes on empty booths that had not been picked up. But, the buffets are very clean and I always see a worker bringing in new food or cleaning up spills. It is a large building and very crowded. So there is alot of noise. The bathrooms are very tidy and kept up well.

Took my car in to get my tires rotated and balanced.  After all, this is a tire store, who else could do it better?  Well... my 6 year old could have done it better.  They gave me a free rotation and balance, and I got what I paid for.  I ended up taking it somewhere else within a month because, from the moment I drove it out of the parking lot it veered to the right.  It also made a weird noise as I drove it down the street.  They also told me I needed new brakes, drums, etc and that it was going to cost me almost $1000 (found out from another mechanic that wasn't true.)  I wont be going back.

Went into the store looking for a specific item that was on clearance online.    The store was a bit of a mess- end of the season sales.  But the staff was unbelievably friendly.    I was only able to find 1 of the items that I needed and when I asked for help the staff was happy to assist me.  Even with the store about to close (I was the only customer left) the staff members helped me, chatted with me, and found exactly the item I was looking for.    They even gave me a list of stores that has the item in stock in case I needed more.    I will definetly shop at this store again.

Went back to Lane Bryant to return the dress. It was too big. And, thank God, the staff was much friendlier today. I think from now on, I will go on a weekday evening. The staff was very helpful, although they did talk me into buying $120 worth of more stuff. Oh, well, I feel pretty and isn't that what counts? Who cares if I cant pay one of my utility bill this month, I still feel pretty.

Women beware!  1 week ago today my female friend was assaulted at the dance floor at Talking Stick Casino.  The man approached her and verbally attacked her.  Among other severe verbally abusive explatives and with extreme anger and intensity the man threatened to rape her because she was blocking his view of the dance floor from his seat at his table.  A security guard was 2 feet away and did not see or hear the altercation (possibly because the music was so loud.). After the verbal assault (which was witnessed) my friend went to a female security guard to file a report and press charges, the female guard was very supportive.  Then the male guards interviewed both my friend and the attacker.  After the interview of all involved, including witnesses from both sides, one being the attacker's witness that wasn't present during the assault (which could have easily been verified by the security cameras) My friend was told that it was her word against his and SHE was told to stay away from her attacker.  She informed the security guards that she would be leaving and they let her go without even offering to escort her to her car.  The attacker was allowed to stay and my friend was told that if the man had appeared drunk at the assault then he would have been kicked out but because he appeared sober he was allowed to stay.  My friend was sober as well.  I urge all women, do not trust this establishment and its employees to protect your safety or rights as a victim.  I do not know how long yelp will leave this review up but PLEASE share this information with your friends and family.

I am an avid shopper of healthier food stores. Whole Foods, Trader Joes, and Sunflower are always on my list of go to places when I grocery shop.   So, when a friend told me how great Fresh and Easy was I had to stop at the one down the road. Of course, I read the yelp reviews 1st so I was excited to go.   I have to say, I was disappointed. Although very cheap, the quality of the produce was substandard. I can get better quality at Wal-Mart (not that I would.) I didn't try any of the "Easy" meals, as none of them looked appetizing, and to be frank, I can make healthier options at home. I did find a handful of cheaper versions of things I purchase at other stores, which was nice, but overall not worth the extra stop. The price was right but the quality wasn't up to my standards on most of their items.   Fresh and Easy is a healthier option over a chain grocery store, but it is definitely not a cheaper version of the quality you get from the "healthier" grocery stores.   A positive note: the staff here is very friendly and are always there to help.

As all yelpers do, when I find a business I love, especially a locally owned one, I want to shout it from the rooftops, or in this case, from my nicely air conditioned home.  All thanks to Lynn at Cool Guys A/C.     Lynn Smith, the owner of Cool Guys A/C, is awesome.  Lynn is professional, friendly, and does the job right the 1st time.  I met Lynn when I first moved to the valley and haven't used anyone else for my A/C needs, but I would say that he is the best in town.      I urge all yelpers to give Cool Guys a call for your cooling and heating needs.  This man knows his stuff.

Let me start out by saying, I am VERY picky about my hairstylist.  VERY PICKY!  I have had the same stylist for over 10 years and I drive 3+ hrs to see her.  Yep, 3 hours to get my haircut.  I have fine hair that is very hard to style and get body.  It takes someone with great skill to make my hair look good and not flat.     A friend of mine bought me a gift certificate at spafinder.com.  As I was searching the website for what to spend it on, I came upon Mood Swings.  I was hesitant, but hey, it was free $ and I really needed a cut.  With the great reviews I thought I'd give them a try.    The main things I noticed while researching... 1) They're an Aveda salon.  I know it doesn't mean much to some people, but this is a big deal.  Salons that are backed by a reputable name usually have strict requirements for their stylist.  2) Their website has bios of their stylists which are specific in what they specialize in, plus there are pictures so you can see what their own style is.    I made the appointment on a Sunday which worked out for free public parking.  All other days you have to pay to park at the meters or in the parking lots.  the parking lots are right behind Mill (best one is west of Mill on 5th St.)  I accidentally walked into the spa part (it smelt so good and was so peaceful,) and the front desk kindly showed me upstairs.  When I got upstairs, I sat down by the door not realizing I needed to check-in in the back of the salon.  When I checked in the receptionist offered me tea or water.  I asked for water, but alas, I never got it.  NOT a good start...  But within a few minutes, my stylist Jayla came over and greeted me with a warm smile and took me to her chair.  I showed her a horrible picture of myself (side view in dark light) with the cut I was looking for.  She spent about 5 minutes with me, asking questions and getting a good idea of what I was looking for.  I was impressed.  She shampooed, conditioned, massaged my head and hands, and hot toweled my hair (something that is also only found in better salons.)  As we talked I found out that the front desk girl was new (then I will let it slide that she never brought me my water.)  I also found out that the salon is privately owned but Aveda does indeed have strict standards for the salon to work under their name and use their products.  So much so, that a well known Aveda hairstylist was being flown in from New York the following weekend to do training with the staff.  Jayla was great!  She took her time doing the perfect cut.  She then styled my hair for about 15 minutes, then touched up and cut some more when she was done.  Something else you only find at a quality stylist.    I paid $50 for a cut and style (well worth it,) and gave a $15 tip (always tip a good hairstylist 25% or more.) Jayla showed me the Aveda products as she used them in my hair, but wasn't pushy at all to sell them.  I scheduled an appt to go back in in 3 weeks and am getting my newly cut bangs trimmed (it is free to get your bangs trimmed back) and I am also going to have Jayla put in highlights.   I am ecstatic to find a stylist that I like locally.  I can't wait to go back!

Fedex SUCKS!    I worked for an internet company years ago who shipped fedex.  After years of crappy shipping service we switched to UPS.  Best choice that company ever made.  9 times out of 10 when I use fedex for personal use, the package doesnt get there on time.  And when you use express shipment they will hold the pkg in their sorting facility until the due date (even if it gets to the facility  days earlier.)  Have I mentioned Fedex sucks!  Use UPS instead.

I had to sit for a few minutes to think about how I was going to rate Seksun.  If I was rating this restaurant 7 months ago, I would give it 5 starts without hesitation.  Lately it has been 1 star and if I could rate lower I would.  2 stars at this point is being kind.  My family started going to Seksun after another family member gave out gift certificates for Christmas.  She described it as "the best sushi you have ever eaten!"  Given the fact that my fiancée refuses to eat most fish, getting him to go was a struggle.  Once we did, Seksun became a favorite.  We would go to eat dinner here AT LEAST once a week.  Sometimes 2-3x's/week depending on if we were going out with friends.   We loved it here.  The sushi on the belt was always cold and fresh and my picky fiancée found he liked the Ca. roll, and his favorite the Flash Star.  Since he cant handle seaweed he would order the rolls made with soy paper.  Go between 4-7pm and it is happy hour.  .50 off all rolls from the belt, .99 appetizers, and cheap beers.  We LOVED happy hour!  The crab puffs are the best we ever had, and I LOVE the Red Dragon.  From the first time we went, there was always a little communication barrier with the staff since he was special ordering with the soy paper, and we would usually have to correct mistakes on our bill, but we could handle the language barrier and they rarely argued with their mistakes.  It was a fun atmosphere and we started to get to know the staff.  After a few months, we almost always got the manager, Jackie, to be our waiter.  He knew us so well, he remembered our order.  In fact, we were able to special order items that weren't even on the menu with him.    Then Jackie was gone. :(  I think it is his wife that took over the place, and ever since, it has been HORRIBLE service and the food is getting straight up gross.  I have seen better service during non happy hour times, but going during happy hour seems to burden the staff and they get annoyed if you order any rolls that aren't on the belt.  Now, if we order rolls from the menu we actually get sighs, or the waitresses (who seem to know less and less English) point to the conveyer belt when we ask for rolls with soy paper, or hot edemame instead of the room temperature stuff on the belt.  When we special order during happy hour it usually takes at least 40 minutes to get our rolls.  and EVERYTIME they get our order wrong.  My 3 piece rolls usually come out first, and the leftover 6 pieces get put on the conveyer belt, my fiancée's orders usually come out 20-30 minutes later.  IT WOULD BE NICE TO GET OUR FOOD AT THE SAME TIME SO WE CAN EAT TOGETHER.    The last time we went, we decided it was going to be our last time.  Our order was completely wrong.  The appetizers sat in the back so long that they were room temperature by the time the waitress brought it to us.  I pulled my order from the belt and nothing was cold or fresh.  The soy paper order came out in 30 minutes, but it was with seaweed and we sent it back (after having to tear the roll apart to show the waitress, who was arguing with us, that it wasn't made with soy paper.)  30 minutes longer, we finally got his order, and one of the rolls was wrong again.  We NEVER got the hot edamame that we had ordered an hour before.  The worst for me was, after being there for well over an hour, I had watched the SAME roll go around on the conveyer belt.  The same sushi sitting out for over an hour.  I am certain they never changed it out.  The next day I got sick.  Head in the toilet for 2 days straight kind of sick.  Maybe it was the flu, but no one else in my household caught it.  I am still considering calling the health department.    Oh well, I guess it is time for a change for my family.  Sorry Seksun, hopefully you'll bring Jackie back before your doors are forced to close.

Ok, it's a big jump from my last review, and I know I said it was my last time going, but what can I say?  We really did love this place.   So I got rid of my jerk face (yes, that is an adult term) fiancé but we decided to stay friends- because that idea always works.  So, for old time sake we wanted go back to "our spot" for a friendly dinner.  Keeping up with the T.M.I. of this story, we got into a huge argument at the restaurant, and we haven't spoken since, but that aside...  The food was GREAT!  As I mentioned in my last review we would go to this place 2-3x's/week so when the wait staff saw us walk in, when we hadn't been there for nearly 3 months, they treated us like royalty.    We were seated at the best seat in the house- at the beginning of the conveyor belt where you can see the rolls being made AND you get first dibs on fresh ones.  Our crab puff appetizers came out within just a few minutes and were so hot I had to let mine cool off.  They remembered that we ordered rolls with soy paper and the waitress even remembered one of the rolls we always got.  The seaweed salad off the belt was crisp and cold, the rolls were cold too.  But best of all, our special order of soy paper sushi rolls came out just as ordered and all of our food came out together.  WE ACTUALLY GOT TO EAT OUR DINNER AT THE SAME TIME!    Thanks Seksun for redeeming yourself.  I will be back soon.  And next time I will be jerk face free.

Have you ever had a florist call the person whom you've ordered flowers for to see if she was home?  I love getting flowers.  Especially when I am not told that I am getting them.  Having the doorbell ring and, instead of a salesman or a Jehovah witness, there is a delivery driver with a beautiful bouquet of flowers... makes me very happy.  Apparently, I am getting flowers today for my birthday.  How do I know this?  Because A Bloom Of Inspiration Florist called me at 2:15 pm to find out what my daily schedule is like and what time I will be leaving the address that was given by the person who lovingly ordered the flowers to be delivered to me.    "Umm, I am a stay at home mom.  I will be here all day, but thanks for ruining the surprise!"  On a side note:  There was a time frame of 10am-6pm given when the flowers were ordered.    So, at 5 pm when the flowers still haven't been delivered.  I call, and the owner gives me a hard time because they are 20 miles away and delivery was inconvenient.  The flowers were ordered from 1-800-Flowers.  It was 1-800-Flowers who contracted thru this florist to deliver flowers to an address 20 miles away.  I have no idea why they felt the need to address this issue with their customer.  This should have been taken up with the company they're contracted with.  BTW: This florists website says "Our delivery areas are GILBERT, CHANDLER, SUN LAKES, MESA, TEMPE, SCOTTSDALE, QUEEN CREEK."  I live in south Scottsdale on the southeast border of Tempe and Mesa.    It is after 6:00 pm, and the flowers still have not been delivered.  The hours of this florist listed on yelp is Mon-Fri til 6pm.  So, at this point I have no idea if my flowers will even be delivered today.    Bottom line:  This florist is unprofessional, ruined the surprise, delivered very late in the day (or maybe not at all,) complained to their customers, and didn't provide the service as agreed upon. ____________________________________________________________ Update:  The flowers were delivered at 6:25pm, and I was told by the driver/apparent owner (again) how inconvenient the delivery was and how she had to close the store and drive the 20 miles to deliver.  The flowers are cute but are not nearly as nice as the picture on 1-800-flowers describes them.  I included both pictures above.    My family member who ordered the flowers was very disappointed and will never use 1-800-flowers again.  Although 1-800-flowers appologized for the issues that we had, they were unwilling and unable to take responsibility for their contracted florists mistakes.  My family member learned her lesson...  If you want to order flowers for someone you love, yelp a local florist in the recipients neighborhood that has good reviews and call them directly.

Really 4 stars or less by other reviewers?  Maybe your taste buds are warped from eating at subway and Jimmy Johns too much.   For a sub shop this place is the best.  Went in for a quick bite after a relaxing evening of shopping around the corner and I wasn't disappointed by the food.    I had the turkey on wheat (around $4.50 and added mushrooms for .50.  I got big slices of artichoke hearts added for free as well as lettuce, tomato, oil, and seasonings.  Best sub I've had hands down.  Also had a cup of cream of broccoli and it was delish.  My friend had the vegetable soup.  It was creamy (instead of brothy) and smelled spicy.  She loved it.  Would have tried a shake but I was too full and I could barely finish my sandwich and soup.  Next time I'll skip the soup or share a Sandwich so I have room for the shake.     Potbelly is primarily in Illinois and on the east cost.  I'll wager a lot of the good reviews are from people who lived on the east cost, and a lot of the negative reviews are from westerners.  It really does make a difference.

How is this place not more popular?  Loved it!  I grew up on the border of Mexico and as one of the only white girls in town I loved sleeping over at friends houses.  My mom was a horrible cook and my friend's moms, we will just say they knew their way around their kitchens.  There were always fresh tortillas and a pot of beans on their stoves.  I begged my friends to feed me nearly every day.  Mexican food is always better than my mom's famous dinner of Kraft Mac and cheese.  By the time I was a teenager my palate had developed and I was a mexican food snob.    Surprisingly, border food is hard to find in Phoenix.  Sure, there are a crap load of filibertos and you can't shake a stick without hitting a Mexican food restaurant.  But a place that tastes like you just drove passed customs, now that's hard to find.    This place hits the spot.  I got the carnitas (marinated pork) it was crispy on the outside and juicy inside.  Delicious!  My New Mexico raised partner went for the green chili pork and he really liked it.    But my favorite part was the Hispanic "mom" who came out and greeted us when we walked in.  Her broken english and her sweet demeanor took me back to my childhood.  I felt like I was visiting her home.  And the cleanliness of the place far surpassed any restaurant I have EVER been to.  The floors were spotless, and so were the tables and bathrooms.  I would have gladly eaten my carnitas off of any surface in the place.  I may or may not have picked up a piece of pork that fell on the bare table and ate it.    We were visiting this part of town so I won't be back immediately, but I will definitely come back.  So for those of you who don't want to eat the cafeteria food when you visit Ikea, come visit this place.  It will kick those Swedish meatballs in the, well, balls.
