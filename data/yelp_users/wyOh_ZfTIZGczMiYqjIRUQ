You live around east central Phoenix, you should already know all about Rosita's. But in case you don't,  and for anybody else, here's the deal: this is the place you go to when you want a fun atmosphere, authentic Mexican food and enough of it to knock you stupid for about 5 hours. I live down the street from Rosita's, and there are more great Mexican food spots around here than I can count on all four hands. A lot of them can have you in and out with a great meal to go in no time, which is great for me because I generally don't like being around too many people when I eat. But I absolutely LOVE eating at Rosita's. Something about the awesome decor, the diverse clientele, the amazing food, and the servers who are either sweet as candy or surly with hearts of gold. It all comes together in a perfect package, and I keep coming back to eat there even when it might be easier to get something on the go.  Recommendations: chicken mole, mixed plate, carnitas plate. Also everything else.

This place... so good. Ceviche is on point and the fish tacos are el bomb. Bonus points if you eat here hung over on a Sunday morning, watching soccer while you nurse yourself back to health over a few cervezas and some tasty treats.

Prologue: On March 19, 2013, I read an article on the Phoenix New Times website, listing the top 10 burritos in Phoenix Metro. I hadn't tried one of them. Being the founding member of the "Because Burrito" lifestyle, I took it upon myself to try every last burrito on the list. So began my journey... So began...  THE BURRITO BUCKET LIST Volume 1  This morning I was sitting in my little cube, thinking about how I could convince Jesse to have lunch at Asadero Toro, so I could knock the first burrito off my list - the classic carne asada. Just as I was collecting my nerves for my proposition, Jesse emailed me. She was feeling ill, and would need to go home early. God's glorious light shined down upon me and I knew that fate and I both had the same shit-eating grin plastered on our dumb faces.  After dropping Jesse off at home with a sandwich, I peeled out and beelined it straight to Asadero Toro. When I entered the establishment, the first thing I noticed was the salsa bar. Red chili, tomatillo with avocado, and molcajete, along with key limes and some other stuff (sorry, I'm primarily a salsa hound). This was not the variety I've seen at some other restaurants, but if it's good shit, I only need one type.  I walked up to the cashier, looking at the menu, faking like I was trying to make up my mind. I was pretty nervous about beginning my burrito adventure, and I'm sure it was noticed by the woman behind the counter, as she stared at my twitchy face with eyes drowning in unease. Finally, she broke the silence. "Are you ready?"  "Carne asada burrito." The words gushed from my mouth. Suddenly her face changed, as if she suddenly understood the goings-on in my head. I paid and told her my order was to go, and she handed me a small Styrofoam container to hold my salsas. THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED TO ME. I was in love. Long have I wallowed in the misery of having to balance my many salsas in the same bag as my burrito. This was a very welcome development, and I quickly gathered my salsas - two reds, one green, one molcajete, two limes just in case.  I got back to work with my burrito bag held close and promptly walked to the courtyard to feast. I tore the top half of aluminum foil from the underlying burro, and took a BIG ASS BITE. Immediately I noted the buttery flakiness of the tortilla and the slight crisp the meat had to it. These guys know how to grill asada. The New Times had told me it was nothing but "straight-up meat," and they came correct on that. Straight-up, well-cooked, quality meat. I tried all of the salsas, but I stuck mostly with the red, as it was the spiciest, the most flavorful, and chunkier than most reds I've had, which I found was to my extreme liking. It was greasy, but the kind of greasy I can get down with. At the bottom of the burro I ran into a small pool of greasy meat, and the grease dripped down my chin with each generous chomp. I could have done with a little extra drainage prior to wrapping. But hey - the whole thing was a bundle of great, and I can handle a little extra grease.  I got up and collected the remains of my burrito carnage, and the coworker sitting behind me said, "Boy, that was fast."  I responded, "Apparently you haven't seen me eat before."  Good job, Asadero Toro, you have given me a new favorite carne asada burro. And so far, New Times is one for one.  Asadero Toro Carne Asada Burrito - 9/10

Okay so Cibo's is really good, let's get that out of the way right up front.  Their salads with pine nut goodness, their sandwiches with the bread that holds up no matter the insides, the iced tea.  Oh good lord almighty that tea is great.  So yeah, after two lunches at Cibo with Jesse, I am definitely sold on the joint.  BUT that is not to say that Cibo is flawless.  Let us proceed...  Jesse was having a crazy busy day, and I was bored.  We decided to lunch early and headed over to Cibo, since Jesse had been craving it.  We arrive in the neighborhood north of Van Buren where the quaint little sandwich/pizza house is located, and immediately I note the line of cars up and down one street, along with the line of tractors ripping up the intersecting one.  There at the corner lies her beloved eatery, with many chin-up suits and aging re-debutantes making their way towards it from all directions.  Jesse, sensing the parking challenge that was soon to present itself, slammed the brakes.  "Go get us a table."  I'm out of the car like a greased-up salamander out of a Mexican Coke bottle.   Scuttling across the street to get ahead of all the winners, I'm considering my seating preference.  It's a little warm out, but all the shade trees in Cibo's courtyard would fix that right up.  Then I remembered the close quarters the last time we sat outside, not to mention Jesse's disgust at being seated next to a table with *GASP* a child.  I didn't know what things were like inside, but it hardly mattered.  My mind was made up, and when the hostess showed me to our window table in the small dining room near the bar, I realized it didn't matter at all.  The whole place was close quarters, except now we were gonna be inside, which meant way better acoustics!  Full tables all around.  This place is way above the radar and has been for some time, so this was to be expected.  What I didn't expect was the high-haired doughy woman in the electric lime muumuu sitting directly in my line of vision.  She ultimately heightened my experience a great deal just by showing up, although I couldn't help wondering which tribal casino was calling all the hospitals, looking for their most loyal customer.  Jesse ended up ordering the caprese sandwich with added prosciutto (server was happy to oblige), and I had the BBQ pulled pork.  Jesse's sandwich was pretty good.  My sandwich was MAGNIFICENT.  The spice was a pleasant surprise, and also gave me a bit of good old-fashioned sweat-face.  I wasn't really feeling the couple of flies buzzing around us during our chewing time, but to be fair I didn't know who they belonged to, so I can't in good faith pin it completely on the establishment.  Also, the server seemed to forget we were there a couple of times, which is always fun.  But hey, I'm sure the Carries outside needed their lemon water refills real bad, having just played their freckle-tanned backs off in the breast cancer tennis match they just came from.  It may seem from my review that I didn't have the best time.  This absolutely IS NOT the case.  I don't think lunch at Cibo could have gone any better.  The cramped eating space, outspoken clientele, somewhat negligent wait staff, all these should be, well, kind of expected when partaking of a place like Cibo.  It's almost like dinner theater - get in, get settled and get ready for the show.  And whenever possible, watch for muumuus.

So Jesse didn't wanna go to DES for lunch today, which meant no catching up with my old friend tuna-peño sandwich.  With much resentment, I offered recourse: "Pita Jungle's open I think."  Off we went, only to get there and see a line coming straight out the door and down the street.  Nope.  I'm not playing this game.  Not today.  After farting around for a few blocks we found ourselves parked in front of PASTA Bar.  Walking down the hall between some "irish pub" and "Sens," we came to a Vespa, parked right outside our intended eatery.  Wow, I thought, this place is 2 legit.  We walked in to a completely empty dining room (noon) and a woman behind a very nice bar, tidying up.  That's what I'm talkin bout, says I.  Plenty of room to stretch out.  Along the walls were various maps of different regions of Italia (assumption), as well as paintings and avant photos of bicycles.  On the back wall there is a HUGE mirror, which I at first mistook for another room.  Upon grasping the reality of the sitch I became immediately terrified that we had walked into Poltergeist III, and I was about to get sucked into a world of shit.  After five minutes of nothing happening, I began breathing easier and struck up the convo with Jesse.  We both ordered from the lunch menu; Jesse had the rigatoni, while I chose the sopresatta Panini.  Both were scrumptious.  The portions weren't the biggest, in fact I was worried my gullet wouldn't be properly sated, but said worrying was for naught.  It was just big enough to soothe the rage over loss of tuna-peño.  And the Panini even came garnished with a small roasted red pepper which was at once sweet and sweathead-inducing.  I could not have asked for a better experience.  Well, save for the end when a couple of suits came in and sat next to us.  But then I have quite a lot of distaste for grown ass men who wear sunglasses on their topheads.

It's been almost 11 hours and darn it if I'm not still thinking about that mahimahi burrito. So fresh. So tasty with the various salsas. So awesome that it's just down the street and I can come here whenever I want and spend WAY too much time choosing the salsas I think would best compliment my meal. It just don't get much better than La Condesa, and that's coming from me, and me has a pretty serious taco/burrito issue, as in I always want them and I always want them.

Came here on a Friday night for Jesse's birthday.  It's right up the street from our humble abode, which adds the awesome cuz we're definitely coming back.  Before embarking on our quest, I browsed the Gasper's site and found that I could make an online reservation.  So I did.  Not that we really needed it, we were chomping early so the place wasn't anywhere near capacity.  Upon walking in I scoped the interior and found it to be tres bitchin.  Mood lighting and cool wall things and other things as well which were cool, I gotta say someone put their big boy decorating pants on.  At first I thought our server was a miserable bitchy Buzz Killington, but she turned out to be very awesome, just rough around the edges.  We immediately ordered the bruschetta, which was prepared fresh so it took some time.  This we made do with, even though I was foaming at the mouth.  The wait was worth it, as the bruschetta  was awesome.  So were our entrees.  I had the salmon and Jesse ordered her trusty chicken parm.  At one point, one of the other servers faked like he was going to topple our tough old broad server's tray.  Her eyes flashed and she almost came unhinged on the poor flamboyant fellow.  Easily the highlight of my night.  Jesse's highlight was the pumpkin cheesecake, delivered on-the-house by the owner since it was our first time there.  All in all, this place rocks.  Check it out post-haste.

Fuck these lazy pretentious bullshit artists. In particular, I'd like to extend a hearty "fuck you" to the hostess. Maybe you should write people's names down when there's a wait, since you can't seem to keep track of the order. Why does everyone hate hipsters? Brick pretty much sums it up.

I get that it's a revolving belt sushi type joint, and that take away orders may not be the target demographic here. Still, if I call in to place a take away order, please don't tell me to hold, set the phone down and carry on with your business for 7 or 8 minutes, then hang up on me. That's what happened with this place. Either make it dine-in only or teach your employees some phone service manners. Won't be coming back to take away or dine in.
