Hubby and I have gone to Postino for years...first at the Arcadia location and now Central.  We enjoy Central's patio more, so we head there.  With either location, we've always asked ourselves, "why didn't we think about opening a restaurant that just puts tasty things on bread and charge well for it?"  let's face it...what Postino does is not rocket science.  Great composed salads, wonderful panini and bruschetta. but, there's no hard cooking.  What there is though is creativity, style and great service.   on our last visit, we headed to Postino Central on a Wednesday night, thinking that since it was the day before St. Patrick's, no one would be out.  well, we were wrong. first, we were turned away by the valet -- "sorry, we're full."  The parking lot?  the restaurant?  Where should we go?  any tips?  so, i got on the phone and called the restaurant -- "Your valet just turned us away, are you looking for customers tonight?"  He was cordial and stated he would go chat with the valet about finding a better way to turn down folks who needed to park their cars.    hostess was very friendly and accommodating...giving us every option for seating.  but, given the spectacular night that it was, we wanted to wait for an outdoor table.  so, we ordered some beers with the very friendly waitress that happened by, and sat in the outdoor "waiting area" watching the sunset.  about 1/2 hour later, we got a prime table -- in fact the same table we eat at each time we are there.   same waitress came by.  hubby ordered a second beer (i was still nursing the "shorty" (only $2.50!) I'd ordered before.  We selected the bella postino platter with white bean hummus and warm artichoke dip, as well as a bruschetta board of four luscious creations.  "bus boy" brought water and small dish of olives (okay, really small -- there were two of us and he brought 3 olives -- not 2, not 4, but 3 --yes, we arm-wrestled for the last one.)  waitress was friendly, thorough, spunky and a perfect addition to this hip, vibrant, happening place.  admittedly, we in our 40s were either parental age of the young 20 somethings gracing the place, or children of the 60+ "second go round" set.  bruschetta -- golly!  we had pesto with salami (great quality), burrata with arugula, bacon and tomato (there was no bacon and PLEASE do not refrigerate your tomatoes), prosciutto with fig and mascarpone (oh so incredibly good) and the "dessert" one -- ricotta with dates and pistachios.  after polishing off the dips and the platter of breads (there are 4 pieces to each "slice" of bruschetta, we were stuffed.    was intrigued by the salted caramel dessert, but there was just no room.  perhaps next time we skip the dip and save room.

loving the 'new' owner and new chef at MWC. The food finally lives up to the wine selection, and i particularly like that they're offering a great craft beer menu. the new patio seating is fabulous on a cool Valley night. service a bit slow and stretched, but you're supposed to be relaxing anyway, right?    flatbreads and bruschettas are really good...interesting combinations.

Saigon Pho Falls Flat  Years ago, my husband and i went to Saigon Pho regularly before choir practice to get a bowl of Bun Hanoi.  Once we quit the choir, and found Cyclo, Saigon Pho was no longer on the radar screen.  Last night, i craved a bowl of pho, and wanting to mix it up a bit, we thought we'd visit the old haunt.  Well, disappointing.  The Pho Tai was flat in flavor, greasy and very, very average.  the "salad" consisted of a handful of bean sprouts, a lemon wedge, one basil leaf (!) and a sickly branch of couple day old mint leaves.    It was sustenance, but not a great food treat.    we'll be moving on.

I cannot believe it has taken me this long to write a review for Justina Duong's wonderful Cyclo Vietnames Cuisine.  We visited Cyclo for the first time on the first Friday after a very positive review by the Arizona Republic food critic Howard Seftel.  The small place was slammed.  Being a woman of action, I stepped in and helped by being the "hostess" and taking down names for a waiting list.  Guess that helped me become friends with the acerbic but deep down sweet woman that is Justina Duong.  You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  Spring rolls are compact but full of all sorts of meat and veggies.  Bun Hanoi and Bun Saigon are tasty treats full of fresh herbs and vegetables.  My husband loves this lemon chicken curry dish that to me smells like Lemon Pledge, but he gets it each time.   the beef pho is full of flavor and comes with a mound of salad, unlike some of the other "cheaper" pho shops nearby.    i can't imagine anyone has complaints with the food at Cyclo.  If they do, it is probably that their judgment is clouded as they came on a Friday and Saturday night at 7 p.m. to a 14 table establishment and expected to be served immediately and be fawned after.  If you are this needy, don't come here and take up a table...we're waiting patiently to be served. :)

Paul is amazing. He's a no-nonsense kind of guy who just wants to get your items, find out what is wrong, and fix them. He's not chatty, but always has been cordial. He's fixed numerous shoes, resoled several, fixed a brand new pair of expensive leather boots that were attacked by pink shiny nailpolish, fixed a suitcase and repaired a tear in a leather coat. Wouldn't think of going anywhere else.

Don't come for the service...don't come for the ambiance or cleanliness...don't come for the other food. Come for the pie. Jack Daniel's Pecan is divine.  Lemon cream is outstanding. Rhubarb is top-notch. there's no other reason to stop here and if you're driving by you need to stop here.  It's all about the pie.

Car #3 is now going to Whitey's. Having spark plugs replaced at $150 cheaper than the dealership. We started going to Whitey's earlier this year as we have a lot of friends in common with GM Scott. Decided it was time to break away from the overpriced unreliable dealers. Since then, we've had the 2000 Jeep in for service, as well as the 2004 Highlander. Front desk is super courteous, JP is absolutely awesome and explains everything in detail, and the prices are so much better. We live in south Tempe, but well worth the drive to Whiteys.

from 2011 -- Rancho Pinot never fails to deliver. The ambiance is classy, yet comfy. The service -- knowledgeable but friendly. and the food? well, it speaks for itself. whether starting with goat cheese stuffed squash blossoms topped with cherry tomatoes and arugula, or eating the lamb with lemon and beans, the food is fresh, inventive and wholly satisfying. this past weekend we sat at the bar and have skilled mixologist Travis make us a prickly pear manhattan. stellar! after the above-mentioned squash blossoms, we both had the nightly special -- a frisee and spinach salad, tossed in a sherry vinaigrette, with arizona lobster mushrooms, duck confit, crispy matchstick potatoes and a fried egg from Chef Chrysa Robertson's own chickens. topped off the meal with a new dessert -- a roasted banana/rum milkshake accompanied by two homemade peanut butter/chocolate chip cookies. heavenly! rancho is a well-established restaurant in phoenix, with a mostly well-established crowd. however, younger foodies from all over the valley shouldn't keep from flocking here for the fresh, seasonal, expertly crafted food. wine list is great, cocktails are inventive and service is exactly what you would expect for an establishment of this quality.

We have been going to classic since it opened. Always great friendly service and always tasty food. Good beer and wine selections. Bread app with tomato sauce is relish. Fave pizzas are four cheese, four seasons and the salami/olive. Four seasons can get a bit soggy due to tomato but otherwise tasty. Four cheese is our fave. Save room for tiramisu...the best around.  Shopping center being torn down so classic is moving. Not sure where yet but they promise nearby and they'll keep all of us fans posted via Facebook.

Who the heck needs fast food when you can have Lee's?  A six-inch BBQ pork sandwich on a freshly made baguette with daikon, pickled carrot, cilantro and jalapeno for $3.10!  Add a brain-jarring, caffeine and sweetened condensed packed iced Vietnamese coffee for $2.75 and you are set to go for hours!!  Service always quick and friendly.  Place is spotless.  But bring cash.

Can't believe we haven't written a review yet for one of our favorite neighborhood spots. we've been here so many times with various friends and family. the spot is cozy and comfortable...nice little "over the top" Tuscan design. Friendly and prompt service when you sit down, and oh so yummy garlic bread is brought right away. you'll be tempted to fill up, but don't.   for starters, we love the pear/proscuitto/burrata salad. not cheap but easy to share with several diners at the table. their caesar salad is fresh and full of garlicky lemony goodness.  we have several favorite pastas -- the cannelloni, which is not smothered with bechamel, but has just the right amount; the ravioli carbonara -- chicken and beef filled ravioli with an eggy, bacon cream sauce; and the ravioli de zucca -- butternut squash ravioli with a crazy-good four-cheese sauce.  we also love their wood-oven pizza. the crust has a great chew and it's not overloaded with sauce. we particularly love the quattro stagioni -- mushrooms, artichokes, proscuitto and sausage...we ask for it "scattered" so all pieces have all the goodies.   we always end with the tiramisu because it is so good.  it is not the cheapest Italian restaurant around, but I'd much rather spend more for great ambiance, made from scratch food and the best service around.

haven't had the food at Essence in awhile because it is just too slow, too crowded and too hot. But, I do LOVE the macarons. However, it's such a pain to get them, I may need to find my fix elsewhere.   Last Friday, my gluten intolerant buddy flew into town for a visit. i stopped by Essence at 12 p.m. to pick up three caramel macarons for a treat. parking lot was overcrowded, complete with double-parked cars, I illegally parked with friend in car to "run" inside to pick up two.  line to order food was 4 deed and the two gals at the registers didn't seem too in a hurry to get us all processed. by the time I got to the counter, they only had 2 left, and i was told they had no more. i took my two, paid for them and left.  buddy loved them. so much that she wanted to take 4 home to share with her family. i called essence this a.m. to order (and pay for) over the phone, so we could swing by at 1230 on the way to the airport and pick them up. well, essence will only take phone orders of macarons for a dozen or more...well, at $3 a pop, that was out of the question.   the gal on the phone said, oh, at 1230 we'll have plenty. really? i said. i was there on friday at noon and you only had 2 left.  so, we took our chances today...i dropped her at the front door and i circled the parking lot over and over (of course there is no parking). friend waited in line for 10 minutes just to be told they only had two left and that the ones in back wouldn't be cool and available for at least 1/2 hour. friend, frustrated, bought the two and left.   essence has great food and great baked goods. but the space, parking, and service cannot keep up with their recent success.

Don't get me wrong -- love Yupha, love the food, the service (most of the time) and the decor. Last night was a real turn-off.  We arrived at 820 for dinner. Still had about 4 tables of people and they willingly sat us. from that point forward it was rush, rush rush. we gave drink orders immediately, but when asked two minutes later for our food order and we asked for one more minute we were told the kitchen was closing in 10 minutes. so we quickly ordered all our food (including dessert). first appetizer came out at lightening speed and was delicious. Our two main dishes came 5 minutes later. dessert a few after that. then, about 10 minutes into eating our food, they started moving furniture around, turned on the bright overhead lights and started cleaning for the night. the cashier came over and gave us our bill, telling us she needed to close out the computer now. one server swept up our wine glasses though my dining companion still had wine in it (she stopped her). when we asked about the rush, we were told that the servers had to catch the bus (admittedly, service runs sparsely in our area at night). But, if you want to have your restaurant closed by 9, put out your closed sign by 815 at the latest...don't take us in and then rush our through our meal. we ended up taking half of it home.

we've been going to AZ Bread Co since they opened, and we love the owner Carol. Hubby and I used to take a long walk on Saturday morning and then go split a carne adovada breakfast. Yum!    Most times lunches are great here too -- great soups, good sandwiches.   on occasion, service is a bit slow, and no recompense made for "lost" meals, but this has only happened a few times over the many years we've been there.   note: AZBC used to have wi-fi and many regulars went there to work over lunch (like me today).....alas, they got rid of it due to service issues with their provider and currently no other utility serves the area.   if you find yourself on this side of town, stop by for some excellent breakfasts, great bread and good lunches. patio in nice weather is lovely.

Picazzo's has undergone a name change and new menu, but mot things are the same...they're just touting their organic and local qualities. Their "puttanesca" pizza (artichokes, olives, feta, tomato) is outstanding, though has nothing to do with puttanesca which is tomatoes, olives, capers and anchovies. their special tropical tea is flat and dull, but serving Santa Cruz sodas is inspired!

Looking for a fun day in the beautiful weather, a friend and I headed out to Queen Creek Olive Mill for lunch under the trees. After standing in line for 10 minutes (menus should be placed by door by the way, not the cash register), we ordered and were told it would be a 20 minute wait for our sandwiches. We wanted to shop and look around, but they made us take the cupcakes we ordered then, and not delivered with our meal. We headed to the tasting table to try their variety of oils and vinegars.   half hour later we got buzzed that our food was ready. They do not provide napkins...you have to trek to the beverage center at the back of the crowded space to get those. Once outside, we were enjoying the weather and our lunch, though both of us finally admitted that our sandwiches were lacking something.  Sure enough, the person in charge of condiments must have been on break when our sandwiches went by. Mine was to be a house specialty featuring their Kalamata Olive spread and their White Balsamic crema. It had neither.   Later, back in the shop we came across a store rep answering questions. I asked where I could find the fig balsamic I enjoyed at the tasting table. I was informed that they were still in production and it would be a few days. Why, then, I asked, is it on the tasting table?  We also let her know about the issue with the sandwiches. She stated she would go tell the chef, or did I want to? I told her it wasn't my job.   Both my friend and I awaiting some kind of apology and offer of a refund (for my $17 lunch), or at least a free cupcake/cookie/bottle of oil. Instead, nothing from her.   As we walked out of the store, we heard a clerk telling a customer that their store in Kierland Commons was in Old Town. I stopped and corrected this error since these two venues are 20 minutes apart.  Next time we crave country and dining under trees, we'll head to the Farm at South Mountain where we know the food is good and customer service reigns supreme.

ambiance was excellent, except though I made a reservation a month ago, we were placed in a tucked away corner right under the a/c. after freezing a few minutes and playing musical chairs, we asked our friendly, but harried, pushy and many times absent waitress if it could be turned up. she never returned with that answer, and later stated "well all the rest of us are hot." we arrived early for reservations, but were pretty much ignored until our reservation time. took 30 minutes to get wine, another 20 to get oysters. then our apps and mains came licketly split. they really wanted to turn our table way before our alloted time, despite the looong stretches of no service through out the meal. salmon pierogies were quite good, as was peach and speck salad. oysters were fine. scallops were excellent, hanger steak was great. wine selection by glass was okay but overpriced. the lobster poutine everyone raves about? we don't get it. we had poutine several times during our trip, but with this, the fries were overcooked and burned, the supposed "lobster bisque gravy" tasted no different that brown gravy and it had been sitting so long in the kitchen that the fries were a complete sog. As for cheese curds, I think we counted two.   $250 dinner for 3 people. Can't recommend.

We've been to the Tempe CPC a lot and just love the huge variety and the friendly staff. We were so excited that a new one opened in Mesa, which is a bit closer to our house. I haven't eaten there yet, but picked up "to go" twice. Everyone is so friendly and nice. Each time I've had to wait beyond the 20 minutes I was told, but each time my order is spot-on, hot and tasty. Now with the new bar in we're looking forward to coming in for a pint and a pasty.

headed to Gallo Blanco today after church for lunch. Horchata -- yummy. Great beers on draft. Had ahi taco (good) and carne asada taco (to DIE for --- had another) while waiting for conchinita torta. The torta was totally outstanding with smoky, spicy meat with citrus action, interesting salsa and creamy avocado. had the crepas with bananas and cajeta for lunch. service was friendly and well-paced but the food, oh the food...we will be back soon.

Second time within two months of eating at Wholly Grill. Found it for the first time during the Filipino Festival at Mekong. Daughter spent a month in Bacolod, Negros Occidental, Philippines this summer so she was craving some of her favorites. BBQ pork on a stick was excellent. Huge serving of rice and your choice of sides. We ordered the green papaya salad, but they were out, so we got the daikon/carrot salad. Also ordered lumpia...fresh and made to order. Got a turon which was sweet and yummy and also fresh and hot. They did not have lechon on a weekday, but had lechon kawale...was interesting, being deep fried, but not nearly as tasty as their regular lechon they have on the weekends. Halo halo was much better than the one we had at Jollibee's on Oahu, but admittedly not as good as the ones she had in Bacolod. Overall, great service, cooked to order food and tasty. Brought along a friend who never had Filipino food and she's now a fan.

After an initial glitch with delivery (due to the manufacturer), we finally got the laminate floor we wanted for a great price. After a few days of trying to install it ourselves, we went back t the store and they recommended we contact Dan from Dan's Hardwood Flooring.  Saturday we called Dan DeWeerdt from Dan's Hardwood Flooring. He came by on Sunday to give an estimate, showed up at 730 this morning and they were done with 374 sf of floor and baseboard installation by noon. Nice guys, and affordable.

I have been so remiss in writing a review for Ivy Boutique. I've been shopping here since they opened, and have been able to update my wardrobe with higher quality items than I normally would purchase. Beautiful Ralph Lauren turtlenecks, a Sigrid Oleson hoodie, a gorgeous pair of grey velveteen pants still with tags, a pair of True Religion jeans still with tags, several stunning purses (and I'm not a purse girl!  guess I am now!), several pair of shoes, and just last week before I headed to San Francisco, an ie red suede jacket with tags and a luscious olive velvet jacket. Gemma and Chris are particular in what they bring in and everything is pristine. They know my style and let me know when something I'd particularly love has come in. Follow them on facebook and you'll be able to see it first. So lucky to have this boutique down the street!

having waited for an Asian noodle shop to open in the East Valley, i was thrilled to read good reviews about this place that was right down the road.  So, on New Year's Eve day, we headed to CMNH.  It was filled with families of all kinds, including a birthday party.  The host was cordial, and willingly walked us through the menu explaining the different types of noodles and dishes.  We each ordered something different.  I had the shredded pork with shaved noodles...which are toothsome and tasty.  The sauce was full of flavor and it was hard to stop well after i was overfull.  Husband had a spicy dish with a thinner noodle.  He managed to eat it all!  Daughter had yet another noodle and another meat.  We enjoyed them all immensely.  Nice touches -- the pickled veggies they bring out to snack on while you wait for your dish, being able to watch the noodle maker through a window into the kitchen (he likes to wave at the kids), and great fruit smoothies.

My question is, why would anyone park anywhere else when needing long-term parking at Sky Harbor? We've found that it's a) cheaper than East Economy if you use their online coupons or are a AAA member, and b) fast than parking at East Economy.   You pull into their lot at University and the 143, you're immediately greeted. By the time you get to covered or uncovered parking and get your luggage out, the shuttle is behind your car waiting to pick you up. They hand you a slip of paper with your parking space number. Hang on to this as when they pick you back up after your trip, all you do is hand it to them and they take you straight to your car.   The shuttles are at arrivals/baggage pick up almost immediately -- far shorter than the East Economy shuttles.   Park here! You'll never go back to East Economy.

Surprised by all the five star reviews for Spitfire.  We either visited on an off night or the five-starers don't expect much.    Went on a Saturday night two months after place opened.  4 people at the bar...two tables of people. Waitress seemed bothered to be there. She was given the basic food knowledge but didn't really know anything.   Beer selection was great.  Onion rings had too much onion to breading ratio.  Bruschetta was okay....but not La Bocca and certainly not Postino.  Our other dishes were fine, but by the time the bill came, we'd wished we'd driven further for better food and service in a more lively atmosphere.

went to House during Restaurant Week and in celebration of our 22nd wedding anniversary. the whole visit started out weird when we walked in and weren't greeted. there is no one in the front room, you then have to walk through a "bar" room with a ton of empty tables. bartender was busy chatting it up with waitress to say hi. we found the host station only to be ignored by a host who obviously cannot multitask. after standing around awkwardly for about 5 minutes, we were "greeted" (stared at until we said something). we requested to sit outside, but given that it was our anniversary, we would appreciate a table not right next to the family with the baby.  we were told "i'll try, but it won't bite."  swell.  we were placed at a lovely table (away from the baby as one could get, but it's a small patio...and the parents seem oblivious to the wails) that had misters pointing right at us from the ground. surprised the plants weren't frostbit, as we had to continuously move our legs they were so cold.   our waitress informed us that for restaurant week, the whole table either had to do it, or not, which we found odd since none of the RW offerings, were unique...they were just off the menu. as my husband wanted the mussels app, we decided to go with the regular menu, even though i ate 2 of the three courses from the RW menu and paid extravagantly more than the RW menu.  we ordered two glasses of prosecco (no offer of on the house due to our celebration, but that's okay..even though every other restaurant we've ever eaten at for our anniversary has offered that up) and commenced on our apps. i had the pork belly with dried figs and pistachios. some bites were great, some were lackluster. it didn't have the fatty quality that i adore in pork belly...in fact, some parts were downright dry. and the serving size was huge...it could have been a main course for many.  hubby has osso bucco which he enjoyed. i had a butternut squash ravioli with pesto which was decent, but nothing out of the ordinary at all. we ordered polenta fries with aioli, and when we reminded our waitress, it was obvious she or the kitchen forgot...we waited another 10 plus minutes for the kitchen to make them.  they were outstanding.  desserts were okay....some great ice cream from a local place, and some fig ricotta beignets with three dipping sauces.  the beignets were a bit dry, but the toppings were great.  had to wait forever for our check, and then to get it taken care of. there were many delays between courses and refills of water glass, and waitress smelled of obvious cigarette smoke on her returns. guess we were second-place to her ciggie breaks.   on the way out, there were no thank yous...just another stare from the one thing at a time host....guess he was busy holding the door open for us so he couldn't say anything....

I wanted to love Windsor because we love Postino. But, there's a different vibe even though it's right across the street.  Service is more flippant and dismissive, the seating options are either too sunny (and hot) outside or too dark (and freezing) inside.  blueberry lemonade is a great concept, but strain the blueberry skins out....nothing like a straw-full to keep you from enjoying your drink. loaded chip app with caramelized onions, bacon and blue cheese could have been amazing, if chips weren't greasy and overdone. the pastrami reuben was good (wet, but good) but not anything out of the ordinary.  chicken salad sandwich was a unique mix of chicken, avocado, nuts and sundried tomatoes but it just seemed like it was trying to hard.  odd service...went from friendly waitress to unfriendly waitress to other food and drink deliverers who had no idea who ordered what.

What a great neighborhood find! Pleasant surroundings and a huge menu with some pretty wild stuff. Nice servers who explain everything.the shanghai dumplings were as good as any in SF's Chinatown, and the shredded pork with onion sauce was a new delight for us. It'll be a standby in this house!

Was lucky enough to be invited to the Yelp Western Adventure last night and definitely one of the highlights was the pulled pork taco from Tom's Thumb Fresh Market. Not sure what type of tortilla/flat bread they use, but it was delicious, chewy and toasty. It held up well to all the pulled pork, spicy/tangy sauce and cabbage. Next time I'm in north Scottsdale I'll make sure to stop for a fillup for my car and for me!.

Headed here during lunch with four friends with really good Taste. Two had been here before so we let them order everything. Ambiance..not much, but its clean and bright. Service...family-run. Friendly. What we ate... Mantoo....amazing little beef and onion filled dumplings covered in yogurt sauce, a spicy orange sauce and dried mint. Addictive. Fabulous. Dream of them now..... Chicken boti....bright orange., looks like a kebab, served with rice and cucumber salad. A nice safe dish. Chicken kahari....a curry type dish. Meat was moist and sauce was flavorful. Goat korma....the hit of the day, well, beside the mantoo. Rich, succulent. Like the bestpot roast yyou've ever had but better. We also had a bread type dish...looked li,e a pizza with no cheese or sauce. Had a bit of a vinegar taste.  Headed back next week to eat more....

Say what you will about Arizona Restaurant Week -- the crowds, the not regular diners dining out, etc., but it got us to try Crudo, and wow, will we be going back.   First, some location observations -- hard to find since there is not good signage on Indian School. Second, lovely upon walking into restaurant but what is the very strong smell of wood smoke? it dissipated as we went into restaurant, but still odd. My date and I were not seated at an empty booth for two, but by a table of 10, and a table of 6, where a young couple with their baby came in shortly after we started eating. Really folks?  I get that you want to have a life once you have children, but don't bring your fussy, crying one year old out to a finer establishment at 7 pm. on a Saturday night. I work too hard to earn my dining dollars. Get a sitter or stay home. (okay, enough soapbox).   waiter was friendly, was great about explaining the wine and the dishes. here's what we had: *albacore crudo with apples,truffle,black garlic -- one of the most amazing dishes I've ever had. * butterfish crudo with tomatoes, arugula - also outstanding *Mushroom-mozzarella,truffle,egg -- a great melange of various mushrooms, melted mozz, truffle oil and a fried egg. heavenly. Short Rib-grilled root veg,mashed potatoes and horseradish -- comfort food elevated to a new level.  dessert -- Tracy Dempsey's flourless chocolate cake with hazelnuts -- creamy, decadent. in fact, i'm going to go finish my leftovers of it now and dream of next time I can get back to crudo.

Been to Brat Haus at least four times now and each time there is something new to love.  first time -- sat in the Bru Haus with friends and tried some beers we had never had, the fresh-baked, the tasty Belgian fries and a myriad of sausages. we topped off the evening with the crazy insanely delicious date cake.  second time -- brought the teen daughter, who adored the pretzel, loved the brat with the root beer onions and mustard, and stole the entire pretzel.   third time -- stopped by after an unexciting dinner elsewhere we stopped off for pretzels with the ooey gooey fundido and that crazy date cake with caramel sauce. (did i mention that both the cake and caramel have beer in them?)  fourth time -- Oktoberfest! Sat on the patio sunday night and had one of their chewy, salty vegan pretzels, made unvegan by ordering cheese sauce with it, a great pork schnitzel that was topped with an incredible lemon/parsley relish, and a huge pile of German dumplings, spaetzle.  We finished with a pretty darned good apple strudel. Oh, and of course, several rounds of good German beer.  Prost!

Visited the palomar last night for an event. Valets were efficient and friendly, and staff was helpful. The public spaces were well designed which is expected from a Kimpton hotel. See separate review for hotel restaurant blue hound.

Can't believe I haven't done a review for my neighborhood Crepe Bar since I've now been there several times. I'll just give the facts:  the ambiance isn't my style, but if you like slick, clean industrial, you'll love it. service at all four visits -- friendly, but distracted and overworked.   first visit -- with daughter and friend a few days after opening. not crowded. waited some time for our crepes. my nutella banana was good but not mindblowing. daughter's crepe was "bruleed" so hard as a rock. we wrote it off to opening week.  second visit -- no fault of their own, the second time I visited the power had just gone out. actually, the power went out for a mile square radius. while waiting for power to come back on, they served us their homemade granola with almond milk. pure delight.  third visit -- went for late morning breakfast with hubby. i appreciate a good cup of coffee, but it shouldn't take 20 minutes to get it, and it not be HOT. food came another 10 minutes later, so so much for coffee with our breakfast. food was awesome though -- we had a sweet and a savory crepe.   fourth visit -- went on a Friday night for their new dinner service. came with friends. BYOB. Service is friendly, but distracted. food was incredible...burrata with tomato jam and basil oil, swiss chard pierogi with brussels sprouts salad, duck confit arancini with some crazy pesto with cocoa nibs in it, the best pork belly i ever had and some insane sous vide cheesecake thing with maple apples.   we'll keep trying for a better breakfast experience, but wow, those thursday and friday night dinners? i may go back each week!

My buddy brought over four cupcakes from Gigi's last night for us to try. I cooked dinners; she brought dessert. She couldn't decide which ones for us to have, so she ended up with four. Here are our comments: mimosa -- the cake was dense, which is good for the amount of frosting Gigi's puts on their cakes. the frosting was a champagne/orange flavor without being strong. it was a lovely "light" cupcake that would be precious for a wedding shower.  salted caramel -- this is the one we thought we'd love the most but it came in third in our unofficial sampling. the cake, dubbed "dark chocolate" didn't have much chocolate flavor. there was salted caramel in the cupcake, but most had soaked in, just leaving the crunchy bits of salt, which somewhat interfered with the softness of the cupcake. perhaps dissolving the salt in the warm caramel and then putting it in the cake?  the caramel frosting with ganache and sea salt was very good. would prefer a better ratio of ganache to caramel frosting, but since there is SO much frosting on these cakes (i typically left half of my frosting on plate, while dining buddy ate all hers ...to each their own), it would be hard to have that much ganache.  coming in second was the lemon. straightforward, clean, well-balanced lemon flavor, both in the sponge cake and in the frosting. lemon curd in the cupcake did not absorb into cake, making for a nice surprise in the middle. enjoyed the yellow sugar sprinkles and candied lemon on top. would definitely order this one again.  the winner?  drumroll, please (and should be no surprise by readers of our yelp review and our food blog)  the maple bacon cupcake. wow.  imagine a cupcake that tastes just like a really good buttermilk pancake, with nice crunchy bits of bacon scattered throughout. not one or two flecks, but a lot. and not flabby pieces, but nice, crispy, bacony bacon. then, put on top a wonderful buttercream frosting that is full of real maple flavor....not too sweet, just really maple-y....like good quality Vermont syrup. then its topped with a bit more of those crunchy, tasty bacon bits. hands down winner. interestingly, this cupcake is not featured in their brochure so hopefully it will become a regular.  we're already planning our flavors for our next visit -- we think we're going to channel our inner southern belles and go for the Kentucky Bourbon (yeah, no surprise there), the sweet potato pie, the Southern Comfort, and the Texas Milk Chocolate. Unfortunately, they're not all offered on the same day, so we'll have to go visit on a Wednesday and then come back the following day for the Kentucky Bourbon one. Tough work, we know.

check out our previous reviews under Picazzo's -- Tempe. Same basic menu, same great pizza. A few snags on the service/take out side that never got fixed during the transition, but is still one of our fave hangouts, and even nicer that I can take my gluten free friends and we each get to enjoy.  however, still take issue with the name of the puttanesca pizza. still my fave flavor, but given that puttanesca is anchovies, garlic, tomato, capers and olives, it has very little resemblance to this artichoke, feta, olive slice.

What a lovely little jewel!  I've always been a fan of The Farm at South Mountain...coming out with friends on Saturday morning for farmer's market and breakfast, or with family for lunch. We've also enjoyed many a good meal at Quiessence. Now, there's a new shop full of lovely beautiful things for yourself, your home and as gifts.   Botanica is located toward the back of the farm. It displays local foodstuffs (pasta, olive oil, salsa, finishing salts, amazing caramel sauce...), local art (photos, pottery, paintings, jewelry, light fixtures), furniture (lovely vintage pieces including a chair I would love to have if I had the space), home decor, gardening stuffs, and personal care items such as some divine honey shea butter creams....  Shop managers Lisa and Rosemary are friendly, knowledgeable of all the items and just a delight to talk to.   Recommendation for turning a dull day bright? Grab a friend, head to the Farm, have a light lunch and then buy yourself (or each other) something special at Botanica.

while my not-quite-a-pack-a-day smoking sister was in town, she mentioned she was interested in looking at e-cigarettes to perhaps curtail some of her regular smoking. we did some research and talked to people and found that the Joyetech was the brand that most interested her. The local distributor is here at Vapor Vortex.  We stopped by on a rainy Friday afternoon and were warmly greeted by the two owners (and two regular customers). They explained in detail each model of ecig they had, the benefits, the drawbacks and let my sister try out the different models. Once she determined which model she wanted, they talked to her about accessories and flavors. They have 80 flavors there (in 3 strengths) and always are creating more. At no time was there ever any upsell or pushiness. She's had it now for 5 days and she's only had one cigarette a day. It may not completely stop her smoking, but it's cut way back and she gets the same sensations. She looks forward to be able to order from them online once she is back home.

What a great thing! On a Sunday afternoon hubby and I decided that we'd really enjoy some beer, cheese and charcuterie to enjoy while watching the Oscars. But I really didn't want to haul off to the grocery store. Voila! I give Arcadia Premium a call (after perusing their website for possible selections and their taphunter.com list) and speak with Lara, cheese expert extraordinaire about what they can offer. We end up with two packs of beer (Boulevard Tank 7 for me, Huss milk stout for hubby) a delicious sheep's milk soft cheese, and spicy, funky, fabulous sausage. As a bonus treat, we got a free! mini lemon tart from PieSnob. Within 45 minutes Lara was pulling up to the door of our apartment building with our treats! We'll be availing ourselves of this service often!
