Awesome breakfast and best customer service I've had in forever, Luana was very attentive at all times and her hard work seemed to reflect through the entire restaurant. Our first visit here will definitely not be our last.

Food is decent, so far the best thing ive had is there bean and cheese burrito. With places like los favoritos and Taquitos Jalisco that offer the same style and at times better food than lulus the prices are way too high here

Was surprised by this restaurant mainly due to its Diner look from the outside but by the reco of most yelpers had to try it out. First of all the inside is definitely very modern and fun to look at. My wife and I came here for dinner and the food was very tasty. She had their Hamburger of the week which had a japanese fusion which she enjoyed very much. I had the Chicken sandwich and this was amazing the moment it hit my mouth. I know live very close to this restaurant and vow to come quite often and try everything on the menu.  Only reason it did not get 5 stars was because the elbow room is not very good here, tables are RIGHT next to each other. I understand you have to pack in as much as you can but it was difficult having a conversation wondering if the people next to you who are in the middle of chewing are listening in. Other than that great place.

Wow wow wow. This is by far the best Pho I have had in all of AZ. The broth is so good that I would come here just for the broth alone. The super everything #1 is what i generally order and it's the best. I love this place and when in Tempe I will come here every time.

I've only been here once and got the most americanized dish (orange chicken) but it was great. Chicken was cut in larger portions which I enjoy and the rice was very tasty. Definitely will be coming back. Their lunch deal for 2 is a good deal

I don't know too many places were you can spend $3 and get a really good quality sandwich. The bbq pork is my favorite. Great Sandwich , also the baguettes are the best around, I grab a few before dinner sometimes and they are a hit everytime

The Best BBQ in the East Valley, I've been here several times and ordered many different items and have never been disappointed. Food is wonderful and the people are great. I love the picnic atmosphere outside when the weather is nice. I normally get the sampler plate and it has been divine each and every time. A must when in the East Valley.

Best dog park ive been to in AZ ,i've only been to 3 but still. This is my girls (GSD) absolute favorite place. They have 3 obstacle courses and a lot of room to run. Most of the time there are nice dogs there but sometimes you get your rowdy ones. Its funny the Rowdy ones parents are usually never close by and when they are they choose not to do anything for the longest time.   Besides that this place is great fun, after my 4 legged kid has her fun I take my 2 legged kids to the play area.   Definitely recommend

I've only had the Gyro and salad here but it is done so well that I cannot think of anything else to get, I stand at the line and look at other options knowing I should make that attempt to go outside my norm but the pita always wins. Great Gyro, large portions of lamb, a must stop when you are in the area. So this ratings is for the Gyro and Sald only.

Just got my hair cut by a short mexican guy and i.have to say its the worst cut i have ever had. They hid the damage with water but when i got home and washed/dried my hair i could see the damage done. My hair looks like waves are running through it. I dont know how this place has so many good reviews. NEVER EVER COMING BACK

This place not only has a great menu, great pho but it also has the best customer service I've ever experienced. They are extremely nice and want you to be satisfied. I absolutely love this place and will continue going back as often as possible

Very similar to another reviewer, I spoke with their front office almost 3 weeks ago looking for a quote and have yet to receive a call back. I understand that a delay is possible but letting the client know upfront would be appreciated. The rating is not for work done as I cant even get a call back

Great food and even better beer. The atmosphere is very casual and all the waitresses seem to be knowledgeable on the beer selection. Glad to support this AZ restaurant and the article on how this place was started is inspiring.

Was looking for a place nearby and couldn't be happier with Tony. Fantastic haircut and great conversation, this guy is the real deal and I will definitely be a repeat customer.

I've been coming here for a year and they are consistently great. Normally I have Tony cut my hair but recently Dustin cut mine and my nephews hair and he did a fantastic job. It's nice to know that you can go to a different barber and not fear that they'll mess up. As long as EMG is around I will be a faithful patron

I was really hoping that this place would be good. They constantly have people so I figured it must be good but boy were we wrong. My wife ordered the posole and their was absolutely no flavor at all it tasted like water. I got the cochinita pibil torta, they give you a side of broth which you definitely need because this thing is super dry. Also i ordered a michelada which was just flat out gross. The only reason this place would even have a star is because the waiter was very nice and helpful. I would not recommend coming here ever

This review is really only for the pho and customer service as that is all we had. By far one of the best bowls of pho that we have had. The flavor of the broth is on point which is key to a good pho. We showed up with about 30 min to close and they were super nice and very attentive to all of our needs. Great little hidden place, we will definitely be back many more times
