worst place I have ever stayed.  What a dive. Food on the floor when I checked in. Asked to have it cleaned but to no effect. It is like daylight in the room at night. Black outs where removed and the remaining are worthless  The bed is hard as a rock with a worn out lumpy torn mattress pad. Desk chair is broken cannot lean back or will flip you.  Needs a major overhaul.

Purchased lunch today. Had a very odd taste we could not identify.  One dish had heavy cilantro masking the odd taste.  Service was not very good.  We could not eat it and we left after one taste of each dish.  We have had a lot of good boba and noodle soups.  This is not the place to get it.
