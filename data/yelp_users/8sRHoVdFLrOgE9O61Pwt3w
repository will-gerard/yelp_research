Good food made even better by the exceptionally nice service. The delightful lady at the front desk was truly helpful and guided us thru their menu and the wide array of grocery items they offer.   We had a meatball sandwich and pasta, both of which were good, but definitely could have used a bit more zest and spice. Since they sauce they use is arguably on the bland side.  The grocery section is an absolute gem, being able to come here and get authentic imported pasta and canned San Marzano tomatoes is an absolute game changer for your homemade pasta dishes.    From the welcoming service alone, I am definitely going to come back and give their pizza and italian sandwich a try.

Sup par mexican food, with average service, in a grimy establishment.  This place is barely a notch above the crappy filaberto's that infest the phoenix area.    Bland taco meats on walmart quality tortillas, and other cliche combos of meat, beans, & tortillas that is supposed to be "authentic" mexican food.  It's not even a bang for the buck as many places serve much better food for less.

Since I moved to Tempe last fall this place has been my preferred dive and after hitting up several other dives in Tempe and south Scottsdale it still is my preferred local dive.  The beers are stupid cheap and the selection is above average for a dive, $3 Mexican beer Wednesday got me feeling happier than a camel.   And since it is a dingy dive bar, I'm not going to be ordering steaks and chicken anyway. I just keep it simple and order fries which do the trick of satisfying that need to snack while drinking. We have had a cheeseburger a few times there and it was also surprisingly better than expected for such a dive.  If you're feeling like making some bad decisions that night, the $1 kamikaze shots aren't bad and they'll help you along the road to regret.   The service is inconsistent but I don't have any complaints.  The wall of tv's and free WiFi makes this place a nice destination for sports viewing.   I really do miss the touchtunes tho, the new juke is poverty in comparison. The patio is a nice option to change scenery and great for smokers that like to keep their drink in hand.   Again, it's a dive, I don't expect much, and I go at random times, usually when I want to avoid large amateur crowds.

Before stepping foot inside the Scottsdale location, I needed to do it proper at the classic phoenix location. It's on the wrong side of the tracks and the clientele feels sketchy. But the staff is friendly and efficient.   On a Sunday afternoon, the wait wasnt too long for a packed restaurant. I kept it simple with just a chicken breast and single waffle. Both of which were fantastic and are more than arguably better that the well known Roscoe's. The chicken is juicy, mildly spicy, crispy and flavorful. I prefer a bit more spice and their hot sauce does the job nicely.   They offer kool aid which is cool, but im not a fan of super sweet drinks So i had a lemonade, lol yeah, thats super sweet as well. Overall a good experience & im looking forward to trying out the scottsdale location.

For the beer aficionado, this is one of the best beer spots in the area. Constantly rotating taps, a large & well thought out selection of beer to go in their fridge is what sets this place apart from all the new places hopping on the beer nerd bandwagon.    They've been serving up great beers for many years & I look forward to each & every visit to Papago Brewing.   With that said, it would be nice if their food wasnt just an afterthought. A little more effort into their menu would go a long way. I can only eat that bbq chicken pizza so many times.    This is a great place to bring a group, the place is huge & there is usually plenty of space to settle in with several drinks.

Solid beer selection to represent a British pub theme.  Food is also above average with classic British pub offerings.   Service has also been very pleasant during my visits.  The main factor for the 2 star rating is because I'm forced to sit here and listen to awful Jason derulo songs on the juke box because their touchtunes doesn't have the feature that allows me to pay extra to play a song next. Poverty juke box features FTL

A remarkable dining experience.    Atlas puts their best foot forward to ensure you have an ultimate dining experience focused on your food & wine while allowing you to be in control.  As you navigate your way thru their prix fixe courses that you've likely selected to pair with the wine that you have brought for the evening, the Atlas staff accommodates & guides you intelligently for the entire evening without distraction.    Their service is impeccably professional.    It's been a couple weeks since i dined there but the flavors of many of their dishes still pleasantly haunt me.  The butter poached lobster claw bisque was so rich, yet  balanced and still retaining the characteristic traits of the dish.    The duck confit was one of , if not the best duck dish I've ever had.  Subtley spicy, mildly gamey, and flavorful in each bite.    The Niman Ranch Pork Chop with maple glaze was simple yet executed with great craft.  Warm textures while contrasting sweet & salty.    All around a wonderful success, I truly look forward to my next dining experience at Atlas.

Arguably the best pizza in town.    So much care is put into the each ingredient to make sure they provide a high quality product.  Thick mozzarella, zesty pizza sauce, crispy/chewy crust, & fresh toppings.    The wine selection, deli, desserts, & grocery offerings provide a nice distraction while you wait for you order.    Their staff is cheerful, friendly, and eager to help.  All around great experience.

I love this place & truly want to give it 5 stars but it truly is a solid 4. It's the best italian food in the area by far, but by no means is this great italian food.    The service was friendly & the place is nice & cozy. We had the fradiavolo & the lasagna, both of which we enjoyed & would have again.  Luckily we came on a wednesday evening which happened to be half-price wine bottle night. This is probably their best feature, every bottle on their menu is half off, no matter the listed price. And their selection is easily one of, if not the best selection of italian wines in the area.    The night we were there they also had some live music going, I'm usually grumpy & stay away from bars & restaurants that have live music since it's loud & interrupts conversations with my fellow guests, but this was nice and did well to add to the ambiance of the restaurant.    Overall, I'm happy to recommend this place & look forward to returning to this neighborhood gem.

Unique & varied bottle selection with a knowledgeable staff & comfortable seating area make this a very capable wine bar.    Cheese plates spruce up the modest experience without overwhelming your appetite.  Also of note its always nice to see quality wines being served by the glass.  Definitely recommend AZ Wine Co.

The have a good selection of whiskey and various mixed beer drinks.  It's a large place with plenty of seating.   Aside from that there isnt much else going for it. It's a Seattle Seahawks bar, so depending on your NFL fandom, that either really cool for 1/32nd's of the NFL fans or really douchey and annoying to the rest of us.  The food is below average bar/pub food, the service staff is slow, lazy, lacking professionalism, and disheveled.   The place just has a really awkward vibe to it.  No thanks.

One of the best sushi establishments I've ever been to. Quick sushi chefs, quality specials, & clean atmosphere.    Highlights during my visit was the Spanish Bluefin Tuna which was perfectly marbled & an absolute treat as sashimi.  Also, was that they offer fresh wasabi instead of that cheap paste you find everywhere else. Nothing like fresh wasabi to take your sushi dining experience to the next level.    I'm looking forward to my next visit there to try out their next special.

I can't believe this place is still in business, the list of things wrong with it is quite extensive. Filthy. As soon as you walk in you're greeted with the smell of foul old fish. Poor service staff. Sub par quality of fish. Badly constructed rolls and dishes. Terrible sake selection, yet they have the confidence to use the word 'sake' in their name.   This place is so bad you might as well get your sushi from a convenience store.  Apparently they also think they're a club and want you to wear a bracelet to identify yourself as over 21 while you sit at a table for dinner.  Absolute garbage.

This was far & away the worst sushi I have ever been served.  I wasn't even expecting much since kabuki is a chain, but even going in with a low expectation didnt help.   I kept my order very simple to hopefully get something safe & tolerable; a rainbow roll, spider roll, asparagus, and iced tea.    The unforgettable part of the meal was the rainbow roll. All of the fish were room temp to the touch with piece of fish cut jagged, falling off the roll, dried & discolored in some spots.  2 of the sections were completely inedible and I wasnt going to risk getting sick eating warm dry fish.  Honestly i was surprised a sushi chef would even consider serving sushi in that condition.  So gross.  Everything else ordered was just average or subpar.  Kabuki, Never again.    There is great sushi to be had in the area, but it's not going to be found at this restaurant.

One of the greatest cappuccinos I've ever had. Perfectly foamy, balanced coffee and milk flavors, & served at a temperature that allows you to enjoy it immediately without burning off your taste buds.  It's got trendy hipster vibe to it, I just wish they had later hours and a proper patio setting.   I'll definitely be back to try out more of their menu as well as their beer.

Not sure why Bourbon Steak is getting less than 4 star reviews. Their service was impeccable, everything that our party of 6 ordered was prepared with the best execution.  Having been to other Michael Mina Restaurants in CA, their prices here were slightly lower in comparison, yet the experience was still delivered at the same consistently high level.   We all ordered some type of steak, filet or ribeye, each with their own aging or grade that offers a unique experience. A definite highlight of the meal has to be their prawns, those things are huge and are true knife & fork size prawns that come both as a prawn cocktail or as a grilled add-on to a steak.    Bourbon Steak is one more fantastic reason that the Fairmont Princess is one of my favorite places to be.

Awesome concept with consistent quality, but I just wish there was a bit more too it.    Their drinks are very good, but your choices are limited to either straight rum, or whatever few drinks they have decided that they are going to make on that particular day.  I find it incredibly odd that a Rum bar won't serve a mai tai everyday of the week.    The food is very good & flavorful, but the choices are limited & the menu doesnt change much so I dont have an inclination to return and eat the same thing again.    Service is good, pricing is fair, decor is nice & classy, and the restaurant is small so you better make a reservation.

Pattie's is a proper dive.   Tons of space, open air center area, and plenty of fellow degenerates to socialize with.   Best feature is that they allow smoking "inside", so you're able to enjoy a smoke whilst, you enjoy your drink.   Decent selection of your usual basic dive bar beers & liquors, which is all you need to get to you last call with a good group of friends.  Prices are nice & cheap, bartenders are quick & attentive. Can't wait to go back & earn another hangover.

Good food & good service at a place with some rough edges.    It's a bit divey with tacky signs posted around the restaurant warning customers that they will be nickel & dime'ing them for additional commonplace items such as to-go containers, refills, and extra plates.    Which is odd because I actually feel they give you way more food than expected for the price.  I had a combo plate which came with chicken katsu, kal bi, 2 large scoops of rice & 4 small choices of vegetable/pasta/kimchi.  The katsu was crispy & flavorful and went well with their provided sauces.  The kal bi was a good representaion of trademake hawaiian & korean flavors.  Mac salad was also a side i would look forward to getting again.    Along with the plate we also got ourselves a teriyaki chicken bowl.  Good chicken, tasty teriyaki, and some steamed cabbage.  Another good item on their menu.  With those two orders that was way more than enough food for a very good price.   Please adjust your prices & portions and stop posting weird signs to tax people for simple things like an extra paper plate.

I ventured into enemy territory to watch my detroit lions take on the chicago bears. And I came here because I couldnt think of any other establishment that would be showcasing a game between 2 of the shittiest teams in the nfl on a sunday morning.    I was a little concerned at first that I might not like the environment too much because it comes off as really divey and you never know how football fans will behave.  But I was pleasantly surprised.  The fans were very friendly while cheering intensely for their team.  The $8 all you can eat breakfast buffet that goes til 11am wasnt bad, I enjoyed the eggs, bacon, potatoes, & toast.    This bar does alot for their fans & it's really entertaining to watch all the patrons sing a long to their Chicago Bears song whenever they score.  I'd definitely recommend this place to any football fan.

It's been a couple weeks since I ate here, but not a day has passed that I havent stopped craving those Pineapple Al Pastor Tacos. So spicy, sweet, & savory. I can't wait to have a few of these again with some of their beautiful crispy carnitas tacos.   I also tried the torta since that seems to be the focus of this place, but it was very underwhelming. Just because it's big that doesnt make it good.  The carne asada is definitely not their best meat in the building and the bun could have been greatly improved.  Don't waste your time and appetite on it.  Stick with the tacos.    The pricing is fair, the service awfully slow, the average horchata comes from a machine, but omg those tacos be hittin'.

On the Phoenician resort grounds, the environment is spectacular & provides a nice comfortable yet luxurious experience.    The burger bar is classy and inviting with an excellent array tequila & beer to choose from.  My go to is the cowboy without the jalapeno's & it's the only $19 burger I've ever encountered that is deserving of that price point.  The quality of ingredients & consistent production really shine thru on this burger.    I have no complaints about Relish, can't wait to come back here as well as explore all of the other offerings of the Phoenician.

Legit quality tacos.  $2/taco is very reasonable for the size, accompanying garnishes, & high level of service they provide.    Definitely recommend the al pastor & carne asada tacos.   Authentic mexican tacos with light crisp on the tortillas & freshly made salsas.  Also they have a fresh from scratch made Horchata for the many folks that love that drink.

Quick, consistent, and reasonably priced.   Much better chicken and beef teriyaki than most of the local restaurants.   Service is as expected for a food court type place.  Cleanliness could be stepped up quite a bit as tables are sticky and have left over food on them.

Angel's does a nice job of being a solid beer bar & dinner spot. The food is good, to the point and well made. The menu has a nice variety and pairs well with the beers.   The beers on tap are diverse for all types of beer drinkers. The place is spacious, the staff is knowledgeable and friendly, and the pricing is very reasonable.    Even though the place isnt very comfy and the decor is cold and uninviting, I can still see myself coming here pretty often. The beer selection, food, vibe, and staff are really good.

One of the best burgers I've ever had.  No frills or gimmicks.  Just a simple bun, meat, and cheese burger with some spread & lettuce. High quality ingredients will beat out gimmicks for me anyday.  Or maybe i was just experiencing euphoria from their Salted Dulce de Leche shake which is an absolute delight.    The short rib taco is also a quality offering if youre not feeling like a burger.  And I still need to go back when their Street Corn is back in season.    The Stand is a Great place.

Cool concept, very poor execution.  Nice job making an effort to offer unique brews. However, not everyone is trying to go on an adventure with weird flavors or induce sleep from heavy beers. The tap selection needs to be broadened. And if a place is only going to offer 5 or 6 taps, then it might be a good idea to brew enough so that 2 or 3 of the taps arent empty in the afternoon.  The food again is trying to be creative but falling flat, instead of sticking to classic pub food & doing that well. It's a menu full of food that could be good, but instead is modified unnecessarily, then prepared poorly & presented to you like slop in a basket.   The service was also subpar and made me wish I was a bad tipper.   Meh, just one more reason to stay out of Gilbert.

One of the best Cocktail bars ever. Most of this place works like a well oiled machine.   They make sure that they keep the barstools free from crowds by having a doorman check you in for the bar or table seating.   If you sit at the bar your drinks will be expertly crafted for you in a timely manner. Their drink menu is deep and everything I've ordered in my numerous trips here have been consistently delicious. They're priced a bit higher than average for the area, but they are perfectly made and worth every penny.   The yum yum noodles and popcorn are reliable choices for tasty bar snacks.   If you sit at a table, it's the same food and drinks, just with much slower service since their wait staff isnt all that motivated to be quick or attentive.   But even with that shortcoming, it's still one of my favorite places to get a cocktail ever.

Wish I checked yelp before I walked in here blindly and gave them business.  Hot wings taste like vinegar. Couldn't even get one bite down.  Mozzarella sticks made with spring roll wrappers. No no no. Smh  Pizza slice for $2 was tempting. Nope, even little Caesar's and 7-11 have better pizza.   Beers are decently priced.   Service as mentioned in many other reviews was seriously lacking. Completely disorganized and inattentive.   Never again.

i'll be quick to admit that when it comes to Hot Pot: "I have no idea what I'm doing".  I got the spicy beef hot pot with medium level spicy (they also offer very hot & flaming levels of spice). Got it to go, the $11.99 price seemed fair for the size & variety of ingredients.   It's pretty much a spicy bowl of ramen with more ingredients than usual such as tofu, cabbage, meats, veggies.  And the spice was noticeable, wasnt bland at all.   I'll give this place another visit in the future.

They make a decent burger, but they have a bunch of bait & switch advertising painted on their windows.   It's best to ignore those ads they have posted outside for 49 or 99 cent burgers, you're not walking out of this place with a meal for less than $6-7 bucks. It was something along the lines of a buy one, get one for a bit less.  So if youre just one person trying to get a quick lunch and not be obese, then you have no use for a second cheeseburger.   I had a burger, fries, and drink, all of it was above average for a sketchy burger dive. The place is kinda dirty, no bugs though so that's a plus i guess.  Service was meh from the employees, you get vibe that they're trying to do their best in spite of crappy ownership.  I doubt I'll return to burger rush, but if someone wants a charbroiled burger for about $6-7 bucks, there are worse places to go in the area.

Quaint little spot near the university.    As a neighborhood breakfast spot, its adequate & average all around.  Where they really shine is with their coffee creations. Cappuccinos, mexican cocoa's, and chai beverages here are fantastic.

The Upton has quickly become an upscale, yet casual favorite of mine. The bar area offers a minimalist yet classy setting, the cocktail list & bartender do a fine job of catering to each guest's preference.   The menu is full of fun & creative shareable items. Each time i've gone it was primarily for drinks & i had eaten prior to arriving so I've only snacked on the pibil tacos, the foie gras/bone marrow dish, & ramen.   Both the ramen & pibil are well constructed, but each is severely lacking in regards to heat from spice. Something that is commonplace among nearly every restaurant in scottsdale.   The foie gras bone marrow dish is a bit of an adulteration, but i still like it. The bone marrow is removed from the bone then combined with foie gras to form a pate, then placed back into the bone & baked and served to you with toast. It's creamy, salty, & definitely makes a statement on your palate.   The exterior of the Upton is definitely another highlight, it's intimate, upscale, & arguably romantic as they offer beautiful patio dining or lounging, while using their garden design & location to keep out the din of the nearby old town scottsdale drunks.   I look forward to returning & i'll make sure to bring my appetite along next time to enjoy the mussels & fried chicken.

The decor is simple & corporate feeling. The layout has absolutely no flow as the bar creates unnecessary traffic in the center of the restaurant.   Aside from the pizza, the menu offerings dont create much variety or excitement as its mostly just more cheese, bread, or deep fried items.  To avoid getting more bread & cheese, we opted for the deep fried combo platter, its an above average platter of cheese sticks, fried mushrooms, fried zucchini, & fried cheese cubes.   The pizza itself has zero competition in the area, its obviously the best in the area as oregano's deep dish is just awful. Personally i prefer my deep dish a bit thicker, but this is ok as it has good flavor from the sauce, sausage, & butter crust.   I was very impressed by the service staff, for being so new they worked very well together and delivered our food in a very timely manner. Our server was very friendly & helpful.
