Probably the most unprofessional CALL I've ever experienced. Not only was she rushing and speed talking, she continued to say she couldn't set up an appointment with me because I did not have a specific Dr I wanted to see. And she told me to pull up their website, and choose a Dr. So I pulled up the website right then, and was looking, and she said, no I had to call back later. Really?! Not even a 30 second phone call. So I called back, 2 minutes later with the Dr. I had wanted. And the way this woman took my phone call was nothing like the first.  She was a bit nicer. But it was still probably the most complicated phone call process I have ever had to deal with even to get an appointment scheduled.

I have soooo many mixed feelings. I feel like it's not fair to review the office when it's lumped together with the call center.  So the office itself, was pretty great. The actual waiting room experience was nothing special. Except that there were tons of people, but the process seemed very efficient. I was called back a few minutes early even. The Drs and nurses, were WONDERFUL! I saw nurse Edith, and Dr Caldron. Both seemed like just awesome human beings! I wanted to ask them to just be my Primary Drs! They were so kind and extremely knowledgable and professional.  But, the call center, that you call to make an appointment or really any communication, is absolutely awful. I still strongly stand by my original review of the call center. But loves my visit with the Drs.

I love the staff at this office! Everyone is so nice and professional, even the secretaries seem to care! I had to come here when I was going through getting diagnosed with Celiacs. I see Jennifer Spohn for my checkups and Dr Patel for procedures. Again, everyone is just awesome and genuinely cares! I wish I lived closer, and that they could be my primary!

Well I came in on a Saturday, so the entire mall, let alone this store, was absolutely PACKED! I will say one thing, I am never coming back to this mall on a Saturday again. Anyway, about this Apple store. I came in for my 1:30 appt about 5 minutes early. It was so insanely busy, but I was actually seen straight away! I didn't have to wait at all! My iphone6 screen was cracked so I came in to get it fixed. And mind you, it cracked with the most dumb luck, freak accident kind of way, that was un-preventable. The girl (sorry i don't remember names!) was very nice and friendly. And took my phone back in a matter of minutes. However I had to wait TWO HOURS to come back and get it! I live kind of far away, so I had to hang out at this insanely packed mall for 2 hours.  So i come back at the pick up time they told me. They came out 5 minutes after the stated time. Turns out, while they were getting ready to repair it, they dropped it. So they were just happy to give me a new phone all together! Which is great! But that phone was only 2 months old anyway, and was working fine (besides the screen). And I still had to pay $117 for the cost of the screen.  So yeah, I was kind of disappointed, I didn't just get a new phone for free, since they dropped it.  And I still had to wait 2 hours. I've probably heard too many lucky stories of people who have had the exact thing happen, and they get the phone for free.  But every employee I talked to was so kind and friendly and very helpful. They made an already irritating experience tolerable.

I have only been to one other Cheesecake Factory. And it was for my senior prom in LA, so it's not too memorable. This was our first time at this location, and we LOVED it!!!! We went for lunch, and were seated straight away. We loved everything from the food to the service! Our waiter, Tom, was awesome! Super cool, chill dude. I love when waiters are just themselves around you, no weird vibes like they're trying to play it cool or be fancy. So ask for Tom! For the food, I have Celiacs, so I had to get GF. But man that was probably the best tasting gluten free meal I think I've ever had at a restaurant! We got the farfalle with roasted garlic, I think? And it was just amazing! You couldn't even tell it was GF! I can't express how AMAZING that was. And Tom even said that most of their pasta dishes (and burgers) can be made gluten free. Uh major bonus! And of course I got the chocolate Godiva cheesecake (cause it's the only GF option). But man it was wonderful! Very rich though, so you gotta love that intense chocolate taste! I just wish it were closer, as I live in North Tempe.  But I will most certainly be coming back!!!

More like 4.5 stars...but Pretty dang good!! I got the 5 mini tacos carne asada with an horchata. And my husband got a California burrito. Both were excellent! He absolutely loved his California burrito. After hearing so many raving reviews about it, we were not disappointed. Only 2, slight negatives. It wasn't AS cheap as I had expected and hoped for. We were looking for a quick and cheap meal. But still, it was a TON of food! And the other is that there were some kinda gross chunky, plasticy feeling bits of fat (just a few) in my steak in the tacos. But I am also picky when it comes to that. Over all, definitely will be coming back.  The service was also kind and quick :)

Worst Ross I've ever been to. A total MESS! Nothing was organized, I felt like half the merchandise had just been tossed on the floor. I could hardly find anything.  No customer service. Nothing memorable really. Except the fitting room ladies seemed annoyed to be there.  I don't blame them. Also, this was possibly one of the most ghetto stores I've ever shopped at.

This is more directed at Sprint, than any particular staffers at this store. The employees here seemed nice, and well informed. I only waited about 10 minutes. (though I did have an appointment).  However their store hours are wrong. Here it says they open at 11. Not true, they open at 10. Now as for Sprint in general. I was lied to by their customer service, and their policies aren't updated on their site even! There is a MAJOR disconnect between actual Sprint (customer service, management/higher-ups) and Sprint store employees. I called customer service at least 4 times. And EVERY time I was told that TEP+ insurance covers a cracked iphone screen, and they would repair it for free. I went in to two sprint stores, and called 2 others, and every employee said, that TEP+ insurance does NOT cover cracked screens because Apple changed their policies and does not allow phone carriers to open up their phones.   So I'm sorry this isn't really directed at anyone but Sprint as a company, yall need to get your communication straight. It is absolutely irritating beyond belief to be consistently told, "Oh yes it's free." And then "Oh no it's not. It's $200."  Remember, this didn't happen just once, I was told by at least 4 different people that they guaranteed my phone screen would be replaced for free.  And it's pretty obvious the higher ups don't care about customer service, if they can't even communicate what's real.

This is the best hotel I have ever stayed at. And ive traveled a lot. So I know what good hotels are.  The staff is amazing! I have really, never met more kind and considerate staff. They go the extra mile to make sure you are comfortable there. We got slammed and put in a horrible situation and they understood it and made us never want to leave. Especially the day my cat got out of our room. She was lost, and all the staff left their posts to help us find her. And they did! They got her back to me! After I was trying to relax by the fireplace Corey at the front desk personally made me, my husband and my mother all hot chocolate with caramel and whip cream!  When they were supposed to charge us an extra $10 in Sunday night, they gave us the room free. Just so many little things that they don't have to do, but make a difference! As far as rooms go, they are clean, spacious and comfortable. I was homeless for a week and stayed here and felt okay with that! I would though get an upstairs room because after 5 nights, a horribly obnoxious family was put above us and they were crazy loud! Even then, we called the front desk about it and the next thing we know they all are outside playing. Which is better than upstairs. Can't blame the hotel for the guests! But we didn't hear any of our next door neighbors! Please stay here! It's amazing!

This Fry's is TONS better than the one on Southern and Mill. That one just seems like it's all about the college students. This one is rarely ever busy. And they're prices were a bit more reasonable. Clean, and they actually had a lot more than the others I've seen. Still a little upset that NONE of the Fry's I've been to have had oreo pudding, or Nally's chili.  But I will keep searching...

I can't say specifically for this location, but I can't leave a review for the one at Az Mills. But it's the same company. (Though keep that in mind). When I walked in, you can tell there is something wrong with those poor puppies! First of all, fairly large size dogs, should NOT be drinking their water from a little bottle like a rabbit or a hamster! When I walked past, those puppies were so dehydrated and we're just craving for water but could hardly get it. Almost every puppy behind those glass cells, was not only dead asleep they were all panting heavily. They did NOT look well, they all looked sickly.  And the two puppies who were awake, were fighting over food. They weren't playing, they were definitely fighting over the food. They do not take care of their animals! I just felt awful! It was like you could just sense something was off... I wish I took a video to show how every puppy looked. But I only grabbed a pic of the first few.

Absolutely LOVE this store. If I come to the mall, it's to go to this store. If you're an empath/HSP/Intuitive you will love this place! Some days it's too busy for me to fully enjoy, but that makes me happy for them! I can never NOT buy something. They have everything you could ever want or need. So many minerals, crystals, incense, jewelry, geodes, windchimes, salt lamps, sage, it goes on! And not to mention the employees are always super kind, super helpful, and happy to be there :) What a great energy is here!

I live in Tempe, so I didn't stay here. But my family visiting from out of town did.  They never wanted to be at the hotel! Sure, the pools and hot tubs are amazing, the lobby is luxuriously designed. BUT it is all POINTLESS when there are obnoxious groups of men and college aged students in the pool drunk, drinking their packs of beer. And their friends kids are running rampant screaming in both the hallways and pool area. It was literally like Spring Breakers return Full Force. Definitely lowered the class feeling, and I lost respect for them. I usually love Marriotts, but not this one. The staff just wasn't as warm and welcoming, and it was hard to enjoy when there are drunkards everywhere, including having parties in the room next to you. I was so disappointed in the Marriott and that my family had to stay here. Besides the awesome pools, the amenities were surely lacking. My family didn't even have a dresser int heir room. Just a weirdly architecturally designed small closet.  Not to mention, if you are ever here during Spring Training, RUN AWAY.  My family has said multiple times they will never be coming back. And I am glad!

I'd say it's more like a pretty solid 2.5 - 3 stars. But I rounded down. Because "meh, I've experienced better" is exactly what I think. Not, A-Ok.  I will say my techs were really nice. I went in for HIDA and a DXA scan, and my HIDA nurse was super friendly, very talkative, genuinely cared and was interested in what was going on with me.  But here's my story. So, my Dr sent EVDI my order about 2 weeks ago. But I never received a call from them for scheduling. So I called them. They said they never received the order. So they asked me to ask my Dr to re-fax the order. They did. And not only did I schedule the appointment, I received the automated confirmation call actually telling me they had the order. So I get to the office at my scheduled check in time. Guess what. They DON'T have the order! So while I was there, at the front desk they again made me call my Dr, a third time and asked them to re-send it, again.  And the entire time I was doing this, the receptionist ladies were all talking and socializing, and they'd whisper to each other and hold up a paper in front of their mouths, as to hide what they were saying. And one lady was even on her phone, checking her facebook! SO unprofessional!   It was a LONG wait because of this. Even with my scheduled appointment. And the person who took me to the back, hardly gave me any direction of what to do, where to change, what to change into. I had to go out and find another nurse who was kind enough to tie up the back of my gown.   Once I was in the back, those nurses were very kind and professional. The ladies up front however, were not so much. At least when they were all together.

Our server was awesome! Her name was Samantha, we loved her so much my family and I wanted her to work at every restaurant we go to! (I wish)!! Haha She was very kind and very knowledgable, and if she didn't know something she was happy to ask the chefs about it. Especially since I have Celiacs and needed a GF item. I had A LOT of questions. And she was happy to put up with them! The manager even came out to tell me that since they heard it was a gluten "allergy" they didn't even cut my chicken on the same cutting machine they use for everything else. So I thought that was very kind of him to come let me know, on what was obviously an extremely busy Saturday night. So I could be assured that what I was eating was definitely gluten free.  Now the only thing that takes away a star, is honestly just for Olive Garden as a whole. Their GF menu is quite pathetic. The only items are either steak, salmon, or marinara sauce. None of which I like. So, not having any other options, is really disappointing. They should really fix that...it's so sad to see everyone else at the table getting what used to be my favorite items. It did also kind of change the way I viewed Olive Gardens when I found out everything they make is pre-made..,

Seriously, these negative reviews make me laugh. If you really want to see a horrible Walmart, go to the one on Southern and Rural in Tempe. That one is the worst!  Honestly, this Walmart wasn't bad at all! Unless you like being waited on your hand and foot. Sure the employees didn't exactly seem ecstatic to be there, but I mean I'd hate working at any Walmart too. Anyway, they had everything I needed (grocery, pet and makeup areas). And better prices than the walmarts near me.  The outside and inside actually looked really nice too!   Maybe come to the Walmart in Tempe to get a comparison...

Absolutely loved the staff! Everyone was so nice and enthusiastic. I loved the first nurse lady that took all my weight and blood pressure, etc. I think her name was Kara? And my nurse physician was awesome. Dr. Incze was very kind, and I didn't feel rushed or like I was a burden. Even though it was extremely busy. Which was the only thing I didn't like.  The waiting room was very small, and it was very busy. People were standing. I was also a bit annoyed that I was specifically told they had an opening at 11, that my appointment was at 11 o'clock. But when I got there at 10:45 and didn't go in till an hour later, I found out it was because my appointment was actually scheduled at 11:20. I understand they say show up early for paper work. But I wasn't told to show up early, I was told my appointment was at 11. So I showed up early. I scheduled an 11 o'clock appt because I had things I needed to do. Also someone just randomly walked in and demanded to be seen ASAP (not cool) because they were in a hurry. After waiting about 5 minutes they almost left, but they got in anyway. I wasn't too happy with that, but hey I got in. Got what I needed. I felt like they actually cared to figure out what was wrong with me, instead of giving me the normal, "Oh it's just your hormones."  Over all (besides the tiny busy waiting room) I enjoyed it, and will be back.

Pretty standard grocery store. I do think it's super cool they sell potted herbs and other plants! The service though was great, everyone I talked with was very friendly! Also their point system, is actually reasonable! You know instead of 10,000,000 points equally a dollar, they are worth a reasonable amount! And fuel points! Live that I get fuel points for every prescription I pick up!!

As usual, one of the best thrift stores ever! They have everything! And it was also possibly the cleanest thrift store I've ever seen! I did feel like some things were slightly over priced for a thrift store, more like the bigger things, and some clothes. But still worth check out whenever you need anything!

Probably the worst quality dollar tree I've been to. Very dirty, and unorganized. The workers seem hardly there. Basically ignored me, only to talk to their friends who were behind me in the line, the whole time. I only go here because they have just a few nicer things than the 99 cent store. If it wasn't close, it wouldn't be worth it.

This place is great!  First off, they are just the nicest mechanics we've ever met! They even drive my husband back home after he dropped off our car. And they fixed it up great. It even cost less than we had expected.  The outside is a little trashy looking, but it doesn't even matter after the awesome service!

Which art supplies are always expensive, but these are some of the best prices I've seen. Also, the staff is wonderfully sweet and helpful.  My number one art store!

Food was great, really delicious. And some of the best sushi I have had thus far in Tempe. Atmosphere was also great.  Service was, eh. We called ahead of time to see if they can do brown rice on their sushi. They said yes. So we go in and when we order it they say, no they don't. According to them it's something with the way the brown rice is made, the texture isn't right for sushi. Well then how bout you tell that to the several restaurants I've been to that DO make sushi with brown rice. What a load of crock. Food (if you don't want brown rice) was great. But the service was lacking; kinda like they didn't have much clue to what they are doing.

We came here the other day...and I was pretty disappointed.  We called in ahead of time, and made reservations. From the time we called, we were told it'd be a 20 minute wait. Perfect. We get there, 20 minutes later. And STILL ended up waiting almost an HOUR to be seated! Several people left, who couldn't stand waiting that much longer than they were told.  We pulled through. But while we were waiting, since there was no where inside to wait, we stayed outside. I can't believe the type of people they allowed to stay outside their restaurant. There were people who had been there outside, for hours. Smoking and drinking, and swearing up a storm. A family with young children just left because of it. They were intrusive and rude. And I lost a lot of respect for Claim Jumper by keeping those people out there. Just my personal opinion.  Once we were finally seated, we ordered our food. And almost everything was off. They forgot several things, and we told them because they kept us waiting, we were now in a hurry.  I felt bad for our server because he was so nice!  But everyone else we talked to seemed kind of rude. I ordered the grilled salmon and it was kind of dry. Still tasty, but dry. The only reason I will probably come back is because it's a "nice-ish" place for dinner with family, that has a gluten free menu. But even then, I've still lost my respect for them.

My opinion has definitely changed! I think they added some new items to their Gluten free menu, and I love it! We got the GF Absolute Pasta, and it was wonderful. There was no wait, and hardly any crowd at all.  Our server, I'm sorry but I couldn't hear if her name was Jamie or Janie, but she was awesome! Super helpful, super smart, kind and way funny!!! She had us cracking up every time she came by. Her service is what has changed my opinion of this establishment to a good one :) in my opinion, she deserves a raise.

I'll start by saying our server was awesome. He was really friendly, and tried to keep up with my family's crazy orders! So at least there was that. I came here with my family, and I can say it was enjoyable. But not my favorite place. They do brown rice in their sushi and that is why we chose to come here. It's more like 2.5 stars, but I decided to round down because there were more negatives than positives. To start off, we requested to sit outside, because inside was very cold. They sat us at a table that was extremely uncomfortable and squished with everyone else. My chair, was touching the back of the chair of the person sitting behind me. I could hardly sit down. When we asked to be seated at a more comfortable table they told us no, because that particular server couldn't handle any more tables...there must have been 4 other tables we could have sat in, but were told no. So we had to wait another 10 minutes to be seated inside. Then the group of people at the table next to ours, was probably very drunk, but also very loud. My party couldn't hear each other talking. I understand it was happy hour but every other table was civilized... Now for the most crucial part. I have celiacs and needed a gluten free menu. Which they have...but it seemed severely lacking. I believe this place is trying to be celiac friendly, to fit more in with the "trend." But they don't actually know what they're doing. There were several items that were gluten free, that weren't on the GF menu but were on the regular menu.  And they told me some things had gluten in it, that didn't. Like mayonnaise, which does not have gluten in it.  So it was kind of irritating to be told they have GF options, but they really don't understand it themselves. Which happens a lot of places. I get it.  So I got a snow crab roll, with "no mayo" since they told me it has gluten...and it was just ok. Not bad, not great. Definitely had that "missing something" taste.  Over all, I'm not sure I'll come back.  The decor was pretty cool though...

So I've kinda changed my mind about this place. Got some things cleared up. While the mayonnaise, still does not contain gluten in it, the mix for the imitation crab does. So that makes sense. (I will praise the day any restaurant creates a GF California roll, or other specialty rolls).  I honestly haven't been back in person....but I order them through DoorDash. I really like their prices. And they are so understanding now of my gluten allergy, and even provide me with GF soy sauce in a little container with my order. And they carefully wrap and separate everything. And I always get free edamame with whatever I order (I LOVE edamame so that's a plus!) I usually get the Phili roll, while my husband will get the Terry chicken, which he says is wonderful.  As for my recent experiences with Kabuki, I have no complaints :) Maybe next time we have family in town we will visit in person. But for now, I will happily continue to order take out!

As usual, the service here was pretty good :) everyone was very kind!  We love Culvers, but mostly decided to eat at this location the other day because they have gluten free buns. I LOVE cheeseburgers, so anytime there's Gf buns I wana try them!  The buns were just ok, they were the usual, very dense. To the point where it's like 80% bread and not much anything else. But the bun was still in the bag, so it was great to know there was 0 chance of cross contamination! And I'm still thankful that they even have them! And that we had somewhere to eat! (Especially since I was feeling betrayed after finding out Blue Lemon closed!)

Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. I mean it's In-N-Out. What else do you need. The food was delicious as always. And as a person with Celiac's Disease, I can always come here without anxiety. Because they are careful with their food, and I've never gotten sick. And of course, service is wonderful. Everyone who works here is so nice. I wish I lived closer! But it's probably good that I don't...cause I'd be here every day.

This is the worst Walmart I've ever been to. Every time I go I hate it a little more. And I almost always leave irritated. Unless you're a college student, living in a dorm, they will never have anything you need! It's amazing how little they do have! Most (not all) of the employees aren't helpful, don't care, and look like they hate being there. I actually asked an employee one time (a very nice older man) why they never have anything I need. And he said it's because they cater to the college students. And only supply the college student demand.  So not only do they lack in their inventory, it's also probably the most dirty, ghetto Walmart around. If you're an adult in an actual household, I'd go here as a last resort. For larger grocery shopping trips it's worth it to make the drive to the nice Walmart in Chandler.

So I've decided to raise it one star. Because I think someone from corporate must have come in and gutted the place. They're painting it a fresher color, they've really cleaned up the inside. I mean, unfortunately you can't replace the kind of people you run into here...but for what they can change, I think they're working on it. It definitely FELT cleaner when we walked in, and they seem to be stalking up on more family requested items, instead of the stuff only college students want. They actually have gluten free items now! (which is GREAT since before, I would have to go to a farther walmart for anything gluten free). They've also put in new self check outs (but which still need some fine tuning.) And they actually had cashiers when I went. I also think they've gutted a lot of the old employees, because while no one is excited to work at Walmart, they were no longer exuding despair. And I actually had a NICE gal helping me with the self checkout today! Say what? Someone who was actually nice to me?! At THIS walmart?! Impossible`! The one thing that made me a little irritated was they carry the most awful pet food still. It's the cheap stuff, but it's also the stuff that'll make your animals sick. Where as every other Walmart carries at least one brand of decent food.  I think they might still be working on updating and improving the rest of the store though... But my point is, I think they're actually TRYING now. It's still not up to par to every other walmart around. But it's getting there.

I absolutely loved the staff here. Dr. Berthiaume was awesome! He and everyone were so kind. I was so nervous my cat was gona hate going but I think she actually liked it. You could tell they actually cared about the animals. And even when the tests proved negative against any infections for my cat, they still offered many tips to help us out. The one thing I didn't like was that there wasn't any transparency on the pricing. I was told I'd get a $25 off coupon for the first visit, which they applied. But I was not told the urine analysis was going to cost an extra $70, wish I had been told before... So kinda steep, but you get what you pay for.

Um it's a dollar store, they have EVERYTHING. Though not everything they have is the greatest quality (obviously). But the dollar tree up the street has some nicer things.  But this place has food!! Also though, it's pretty ghetto. Get some sketchy people hanging around.  But overall if definitely recommend everyone come here before going grocery shopping elsewhere.

This is probably the nicest post office I've ever been to. Well the building is really old, but how cool is that?! It's well maintained. But the staff are really friendly as well. I was actually surprised at how nice and helpful they are. And really helpful! They actually explain what's going on if there's ever a problem so everyone understands.

Very good! We got the chicken Katsu and pineapple chicken plates. Both were great. Also the spam musubi was pretty good. I'm hawaiian and have been desperate for my fix of good food in the mainland. This hit the spot. Basically, is exactly like L&L. Probably the exact same recipes; sure tastes like it! Probably not the same quality as what you'd actually get IN Hawaii though...the food in the islands is ALWAYS better. But good for mainland standards. Will satisfy my cravings for the time being.

My previous review still stands. But I'd like to add some other things. Particularly about how awful the HOA is! They basically don't exist. They have never returned any of my calls. My landlord has to call them because for some reason I never get a response. They hired this landscape company that comes at 6 am. every Friday morning. And basically all they do is blow dirt and pine needles into my patio for over an hour. It's like they just stand there, leaving the leaf blower on and text on their phones or something.  I thought they got here early just to beat the heat. But then why do they come Thursday after noons and do the same thing?!  Also there are so many loud college students around. They come home drunk, late at night and are so inconsiderate, they yell and scream all the way from the parking lot to their apt.

I LOVE Costa Vida. We came here last night for dinner for the first time. We moved here from another college town, and Costa Vida was there and we loved that one too.  This one is a bit smaller. But still just as good. The sweet pork is the only thing I ever want. So anything with the sweet pork in it, get it. As for this location. It was good. I'd say a satisfactory substitute for chipotle or Qdoba. We went right at prime dinner time hours,and there were only 2 other groups of people there. So that made me happy, because I hate crowds. So we were fast! The girls who worked there weren't that happy...but I was super appreciative of the one who was really nice and promptly removed her gloves without me even needing to ask when I told her I had Celiacs. She was the nicest looking person in the whole place!

Someone lives in my friends apt complex that drives a car for this company. And they are awful at parking. I don't know if they just genuinely don't know how to park, or if they're  they think it's ok to put your whole car in the line, taking up two spaces. But every time I come and I need to use a visitor spot, two of three are taken by this one car.

CROOKS! Do not work with them! Everything seemed fine and dandy. Till I moved in. They made a video of the home, making it look beautiful and since I was searching from out of state, it seemed like they were so helpful. And then I got to the house. Discovering it hadn't actually been cleaned in 8 months. There was so much wrong with it. They lied to me about the condition and the HORRIBLE neighborhood it was in!  Then when I tried to get out of it they took $900 and said it was non refundable.  As soon as I said we didn't want to live there they stopped the kind service and stopped caring and stopped responding.  Not worth it!

Very clean and organized! Workers were pretty friendly. And I thought everything was priced decently. I even found one item that didn't have a tag, and she just charged me .99 cents. When it was certainly worth more. Great deal for me!

First off, the food was amazing! I am hawaiian so I know the good stuff. And boy did this hit the spot. We came in for lunch but they were still serving breakfast. So I got the loco moco and some Portuguese sausage. That was the nicest, fanciest, best tasting loco moco I've ever had. Portuguese sausage was a bit spicier than what I'm used to, but still good. The service was amazing! We had the nicest waiter! We were getting ready to move here from Idaho and our server actually stayed past his shift to sit down and talk with us about the area. Go!!!

My family and I came here for lunch. With my Celiacs and how picky everyone else is, we were struggling. Then we came here! And they have tons of Gf items! I got the coconut curry chicken, and it was nothing short of AMAZING! Especially being Gluten free, NO WAY! The flavors were so intense and unique! The strawberry basil frozen lemonade was equally wonderful. And I didn't have that disgustingly full feeling after. Well until I ate the flourless cake, it was intensely rich, but again, amazing! The service was also great, the girls were very friendly.  It's a bit expensive but you're getting what you pay for!  Definitely coming back!!

I like this place, or well it's decent. The actual techs and nurses are always really nice and helpful, and make you feel comfortable there. The front desk staff is hit or miss. And the wait has never been terribly long for me. I walked in for an X-ray today, and no one was in front of me. I was in and out in under 30 minutes. But by the time I left there was tons of people in the waiting room.

So completely disappointed. I lost my surface pro 2 pen over vacation. Came in to see if they either had that pen or something else compatible.  The girl I talked to said they didn't make the pen anymore...and that was it. She didn't have any other knowledge and she didn't even make an effort to find me another solution when I asked. She just seemed very um... UN-knowledgeable. She did say that we could go across to Brookstone because they have a universal pen. So we went...and guess what? Nope.  EDIT**** I've been chatting with the Microsoft store support online (they are always much more friendly and helpful). And they are able to ship me a new pen! I asked my CS rep if it was true Microsoft stopped making the pens for Surface pro 2s, and she said that's not true, and it really just depends on the stock of the store. So now I have the proof that the woman I spoke to at this store just really didn't know anything...

Went tonight through the drive through, and even that was just awesome. When you go through, they give you your drink and then tell you to pull up to a certain number and they brig the food out to you; giving it a slight Sonic feel. And the service was great. Everyone was so kind. And we didn't even wait long for our food.  Speaking of which, was great!!! It didn't have that disgusting greasy fast food quality you'd normally get when your food is delivered that quick. We both had burgers with fries, and again, super yummy! Might be one of our new favorites!

So last time we just went for the burgers. Tonight we went for desserts. And man oh man, it was spectacular! I just love how nice every worker there is!! We went inside and everyone gave us a genuinely friendly hello. And they were happy to help us with our order. We got a mint Oreo and brownie concrete. Holy cow! It was amazing!!! Best shake/concrete I have ever have hands down!

DO NOT take your dogs here! What an awful place!  I came here once to just check them out and see if I wanted to take my own dogs here while I went out of town.  And what I saw, I am absolutely appalled!  First of all, when I walked in, there was no one there. The place looked deserted, of humans at least. It took a full 10 minutes before anyone even greeted me. Talk about unprofessional. Secondly, when I did see people working there, I noticed it was all only young guys, no women. I just thought that was interesting... Thirdly. The place smells AWFUL. Do they ever clean it? I'd guess no from the smell alone. Fourthly (the most important thing in my opinion). When I did see someone, I saw a few boys in what I assume is like the main play area. They were scruffing dogs, jerking them around, and dragging them across the room.  I will NEVER return to such an establishment, and never would I even consider letting my dogs stay here for any amount of time. Think twice before letting your family member stay here.

Food was ok. There was a hair in my fruit bowl...I have Celiacs and needed gluten free options. When I asked our waitress for a gf menu, I got a very cavalier "No." When we asked about just gf options, again it was a "no. No options." Our waitress just seemed like she did not give an ounce of care. And naturally that really irritated me. She didn't offer any information or care to show us what things may be cross contaminated or if they added anything. So what I ordered was all at my own risk. And now I am not feeling well. And after that it seemed like she had a bit of an attitude with us.  Just not great customer service all around. My husbands burger patties were also a bit dry.  Don't think I'll be coming back.
