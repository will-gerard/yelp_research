Looked online for a laptop and checked availability. I called this store to double check before driving 30 min. I got here and they didn't have either one.   I also remember having issues returning something here about two years ago and it was a nightmare.

I have yet to find a better beer selection in Phoenix. The bottles aren't on the menu though, you have to walk over to the fridge. If you get the pretzel's choose the cheese over the mustard.

Very friendly staff and great food. Bar far my favorite Korean spot in town.

This place is really popular. There was constant traffic the entire time. It's worth checking out for sure.

It is fun to go during spring training.

This is a good alternative to Subway. They have a more original menu and less of a corporate feel. There's also a punch card for frequent visitors.

I saw a coupon online for $50 off, so I called to get a quote on replacing my brake pads. I told him the make and model of my car, which is a fairly common non-luxury vehicle. He said he wouldn't know the cost until he saw it and I had to bring it in. He said it could be from $100 to $1000, but he wouldn't know until he did an inspection.

I never thought I would come back to this Mazda service shop after they gave me an exorbitant quote for some minimal repairs a few years ago. This time they gave me another quote which was even more ridiculous than the last time. I left.   I went to an auto parts store across town, spoke with their staff and purchased a part that the cashier even helped me install. Total repairs cost me around $100 (new battery), rather than $5000 (new transmission).   If your car needs repairs, go anywhere else.

The sliders, wings and burgers are delicious. My buddy said they have the best macaroni and cheese he's ever had. Currently they have specials in the afternoons.
