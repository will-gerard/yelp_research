I love Cheba Hut.  Their product is on point, and their staff is always super friendly and helpful.  Their food is delicious and interesting, not to mention those are some of the prettiest sandwiches I've ever seen.  Great atmosphere, very chill and fun.  My only complaint, is I wish they had a wider delivery area.

Great dive bar.  Complete with surly barmaid.  Awesome chintzy tiki decor.  The smell if stale beer hits you at the door and the stools are lovingly duct taped. Cash only. *muah*

All around, pretty good place!  The staff was incredibly friendly, they all greeted me heartily when I came in. My server - I think his name was Ben... was so polite, attentive and prompt.  I ordered a strawberry basil martini - with fresh muddled berries and basil leaves - it was very good.  For dinner I had the gyro platter with a Greek salad.  The salad was wonderful, the pita was perfect, and the gyro meat made the platter worth paying for.  I wasn't super impressed with the rice, it kind of reminds me of something you'd buy pre-seasoned and dehydrated in a packet at the grocery store... And it was a little mushy and over cooked... But not terrible by any means... Just not on par with everything else.  The potatoes weren't bad either, but just like the pilaf - a bit mushy and not seasoned subtly.   The portion was huge, so I have a good bit leftover for lunch tomorrow (hooray!)...  But I glanced at the desert menu and couldn't resist trying the baklava cheese cake (whuut?! ) - yeah, you read that right. I am so glad I did, it was so f@cking good.  So...f@cking...good.  So if nothing else - go for this and their other deserts that also looked amazing.

If I could give them negative stars I would.  Single worst customer service experience of my life... and I used to have Time Warner Cable! So that's saying something. It begins... three weeks ago.  My internet went out at 12pm on Saturday 7/19 - it came on again at 12am... So Sunday I called Cox.  The first appt they had was Tuesday.  My internet continued to turn off in these exact 12 hour intervals.   A tech shows up Tuesday, pokes around, changes out cables but seems very confused.  She tells me she is going to have to call in the big guns and have them check the lines later that day, and that I would be called with an update but that I will not have to be home.  The internet doesn't work at all anymore.  Cox shows up later that day and allegedly does something, they don't call and give me any info and I come home to find that my internet still doesn't work.   I call the next morning, the CS rep is a jerk, and is very lackadaisical about helping me - finally I get him to read the notes on my account... so he puts in another service request.  The guy comes out the next day, and lo and behold actually has any idea whats going on... is very forthcoming with info as to what is happening, and tells me that the cable under my back yard needs to be flushed out and replaced or they'll have to dig it up.  This is on Friday 7/25.  He puts in a temporary line so I at least have internet, and tells me a tech will coming Monday morning.   CUT TO: Saturday (the next day)... 8 AM!! Apparently someone named Joe comes to my house, doesn't call me, doesn't ring the doorbell, nothing... and then leaves a "whoops must've missed you" note on my door... which is bullshit - because me and my roommate were both there... as well as dogs who bark when people come to the door.  Also it's 8AM ON A SATURDAY, with no appointment, SO WTF?  Until this point, the techs have been very good about calling my cell phone - so I could actually like - go to work and stuff in between this rigamarole. I call the number Joe left on his note, and leave a message with my cell number telling him to please call so I know what's going on... nothing. Monday - the day they're actually supposed to show up - no one shows up. I call Joe again, no answer. Now - today is Thurs 7/31... I woke up late, and was getting ready for work when I hear my dogs start going nuts.  It takes me a few minutes, but I go to the door and see a Cox truck parked out front... and the guy (presumably this Joe character) - looks like he is getting ready to leave.  Again - DOESN'T CALL, DOESN'T KNOCK... NOTHING.  I wasn't even AWARE of an appointment today, and if I hadn't by pure chance been late for work today - I would have missed him again!!!  So he asks me to open the gate out back and tells me he's going to flush out the conduit. He goes out back and does some stuff for a couple of hours, I call my boss and tell him whats going on - because I am now being held hostage by the cable folks AGAIN, with no warning so I can plan for it. Then I look up and he's GONE.  He just left with no information or anything, and he knew I was there waiting to go to work!!! So I call Cox again - the girl on the phone must be new and has no idea about anything - she puts me on hold and after five minutes transfers me back to the opening prompts.  I then get a guy who gives zero shits about anything and the volume on his mic is WAY low, so I can barely make out anything he says - and he looks into my case and says - oh yes, the tech made an appointment for later today for a "fix and frame" - whatever that means.  But has no time associated with the appointment.  So here I am, missing yet ANOTHER day of work - waiting on this supposed appointment that may or may not happen.  I gave the guy my cell number (again) and told him to put a note in for the tech to please call me... but I am 100% sure they wont.  I have zero faith that anything will be fixed today, and I wont get any updates.  They will come back on some random day without warning and just expect me to magically be at home... because I don't have MULTIPLE jobs to be at. I really feel at this point that (a) this month of service should be completely free, and (b) I should be compensated for the hours and days of work I have missed - because that will greatly impact me financially.  All in all - Cox is a fucking nightmare.  Unfortunately I am paying my roommate who is out of the country, for the service. So I really can't just cancel it and move on.  I can only hope that they eventually fix the lines, and things go back to normal - and I can have my mildly adequate service back... and get this temporary line out of mine and my neighbor's yard.

Fun! I went with my friend Alexis who takes improv classes there... It was a good time! Good intimate space, well organized, beer and concessions.   I will definitely be going again.  Though the all ages thing is great for families, my group kept getting glares from the uber Christian grandma in front of us for various suggestions we threw out... It was kind of ridiculous.  It's a comedy club, gettoverit lady.  Anyway, I also noticed while I was there - in a couple of weeks, one of my favorite comedians is going to be there, Kevin McDonald!!! So I'll be back. If you like improv - check it out!

This place is absolutely perfect. Awesome service, lovely organic prohibition era cocktails, really wonderful eclectic open-air atmosphere.  The Duce is absolutely adorable.  Perfect place for an event.  Also the food is beautiful and they have old school games like corn hole, ping pong, and fooseball... Also on Sundays, boxing!  You gotta check it out!!!

Not impressed.  I feel like I just paid too much for frozen yogurt with fruit on top.  The bowl I had was a cherry walnut, and it was okay.  It definitely didn't blow my mind.  The fact that they have all of their vitamins and supplements in bottled powder or liquid form tells me their idea of nutrition is a little off base.  Also - I realize this isn't entirely their fault, but there is a nail salon next door and the odor of acetone coming through into their shop is - overwhelming!  I don't see how anyone eats in there, it was nauseating.  The smell of chemicals isn't really synonymous with the healthy image they're trying to create.  Also the atmosphere is a bit clinical... The shop is very sparse, so sound just echoes everywhere and it's just kind of awkward.   All in all, I'd say this place is "eh" at best... If you're looking for something that is really healthy - go to Chop Shop or Green.

I had the Arizona Burger, which is a delicious, juicy green chile burger on a brioche bun.  It came with a crunchy pickle spear and a slice of watermelon.  I also tried some of their sparkling pomegranate juice  (yum). The service was friendly and fast.  The atmosphere is open and very relaxing.

I am overjoyed to have found this place.  I work beyond too much, and have resorted to eating whatever junky food I came across for the past few months - which has resulted in me gaining weight and feeling like garbage.  Until now.  Chop Shop recently opened near where I work, and as it turns out - there is one near my house too.  It's no more expensive then the fast food I've been living off of.   Everything they make is simple, fresh, organic and incredibly delicious.  Also they have a loyalty program, which is great for me, because I plan on eating here as much as possible. Also the atmosphere at both locations is very lovely.

I've been wanting a larger tattoo done for some time now... But I haven't been impressed by any of the shops I've come across in the valley.   I had a very vague idea of what I wanted... But neither the time nor the imagination to flesh anything out myself.   Again... I've been pretty disappointed in most tattoo shops in the area... I think most of them get by on really mediocre work.  But after about two minutes of being in this shop, looking through some of his drawings and photos of past clients' work - I was immediately impressed with everything I saw.  Frank, the owner and primary artist at Bitter Dose is incredibly talented.  He seems to have no problem working in whatever style the customer prefers.  He is great at taking a basic concept (like mine) and developing it into something that is interesting and intricately executed. I will be going to him for all future pieces.  I would recommend if you want some really nice work done - definitely go to this guy.
