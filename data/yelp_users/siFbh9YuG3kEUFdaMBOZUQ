Amazing, amazing, amazing!  The ambiance, our waiter, Tempe, the fresh baked bread, the Organic Field Greens Salad, the Mezaluna Ravioli, the Favabeans ravioli... loved it. Loved it all.  Everything was just so fresh since their products were all locally grown/raised within what i believe was a 20 mile radius. They also promote sustainability and use mainly organic ingredients -- which is always a plus in my book. I'd for sure return to this restaurant if I were ever back in the area.

Terrible.   My spaghetti was overcooked and flavorless, the free wine was like vinegar (but what do u expect of free wine), the cappucino tasted like it came from a vending machine, the service was slow, and the old frail man on the accordian was kind of entertaining and cute until he asked for money.

Just stopped here as my final meal out in Vegas.  I love the Venetian, so I decided to grab a bite somewhere inside so I can enjoy the fake scenery and pretend I was actually in Venice.  I forget the name of the dish I had but it was linguine w/ a mix of seafoods. It was excellent! I only wish it didnt fill me up -- I was eyeing up the gelato stand in the middle of St. Marks Square.   I'd recommend you go here since the food is pretty decent , it's semi romantic, and the prices aren't half bad.

What in the world?! How does this place have such positive reviews????   Staff - SLOW, slow, slow. Other than slow, they looked miserable - I almost felt bad for them.  Food - When walking into a buffet there should be So many items that stick out that Im overwhelmed and can't decide. This was not the case - I actually had a hard time deciding this time because nothing was appealing.  - the only thing that I was slightly excited about was the fried chicken - which btw was also disappointing. It was greasy and flavorless. The lamb was another item that was bad - it was extremely overcooked - dry and jerkylike. I even had a hard time trying to cut it into pieces. I should not be struggling this much. Crablegs were sad - hardly any meat and icy cold. Desserts - not good. The crepes were so sad. The blueberry parfait had the worst texture. Upon first bite, I wanted to throw up.  In the end, I left the buffet hungry and unsatisifed. This should never be the case when I'm at a buffet.

Work took me here for a nice birthday treat. Just like everyone else has stated - the view is here is amazing!! If you can't afford dinner here at least go for the HH on the outdoor balcony. Such a great view of the whole strip - you can see right down the whole thing!  Anyways for food, I'd totally recommend the Braised Waygu beef. Out of this world.   Bathroom was also pretty awesome. You can see outside while doing your thing! A lil odd at first but check it out.

Maybe I should have gotten a pretzel at the New York PRETZEL Co., but I went for the Caramel Apple instead. Bad choice. It was SOOOOOOOOO hard! If I had filings, the caramel would have broke them all :( Oh and it was $10... ew.

Anything with prosciutto makes me smile.  Started off with the Snack Plate which consisted of Sopressatta, Parmigiano Reggiano, PROSCIUTTO!, and other good snackins for just $4! Can't be beat!  Then went for the Prosciutto e Mela pizza which was fantastic! I can honestly see myself eating this as my last meal if i were on my death bed. It was THAT yummy.
