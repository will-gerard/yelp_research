If I could give this place a ZERO I would. They don't even deserve one star. The WORST customer service I've had in quite a long time. The guy was so rude and the quote was beyond OUTRAGEOUS! They were having a sale and the flooring I like was 23% off. So I was thinking "great this will be cheaper than the other two quotes I got!" My quote from Baker Bros was almost 600 DOLLARS more than the other two quotes and that was with their "sale"????? These people are RIPPING people off! There were a lot of elderly people in the store when and I just thought, these poor old folks are being taken advantage of! I would NEVER EVER recommend this company to anyone! Go elsewhere!!!!  Scream and yell in your show room? Wow. You guys are liars too. That's wonderful.

I happened upon this barber today, and LOVED them! Simon and Olicia cut my two boys' hair. They have curly hair and I've been driving 30 minutes to 55th Ave to get them good haircut. I either drove far or would leave a place disappointed. After reading the reviews I gave Gio's a try and they were fantastic!!! They actually listened to exactly what I wanted. I found a permanent barber shop for my boys and its s close! I would 100% recommend this place!

Worst customer service! My couch is just 6 months old and it looks like I've had it for years. Purchased the "VIP PLAN" which was just an absolute waste of money. They do nothing to honor what you've purchased. I am so beyond frustrated! It is a scam. Since I can get NO WHERE with customer service or manager, I am going to contact 3 on your side. Maybe Gary can get something done for all of us..

Everyone in store was so nice and apologetic. They took such good care of me and I am so grateful. I found out they no longer work with the company that ran their VIP plan and are now partnered with someone completely different. I don't know if it was the bad review, my constant calling and going in... Whatever it was, I don't care. They really and truly surpassed my expectations and I will 100% be back for future purchases.

This is HANDS DOWN, the best sushi I've had in Scottsdale. The fish was so fresh and cold.. Mmm. Just melted in my mouth.  The chili garlic edamame was sooooo good too! Definitely order the specialty rolls. I ordered two of them and don't have a pic because I ate them too fast! Emily our server was top notch. She was attentive and so sweet! I can't wait to come back! You will not be disappointed!

Best customer service I've ever gotten at a nail salon. The workers were very friendly when I walked in. They took such great care of me and didn't make me feel rushed at all if someone was waiting. Best pedicure I have ever had! My mouth watered during the entire pedicure. I also had reflexology done. Drinks and snacks on the house too. This place is definitely worth a shot. I live in scottsdale and make the drive every time. Quality service, my gel never chips and shaped perfectly. I was also given my own personal nail file, and two buffers to ensure safety and sanitation. This place is the best. I will never go anywhere else.
