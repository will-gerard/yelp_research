I spent my birthday at Chart House last night and had a wonderful experience. The food was great I got the stuffed shrimp and to drink the moscato sangria...yum! Anyways the food was great but to top my experience my server was even greater. Josh was our server and he went above and beyond his duties. My two year old daughter was with us and when she wanted cherries from my drink and couldn't have them he went and got her a plate of cherries then when she was eating all my croutons he went and grabbed her a bowl of croutons. It's the little things like that, that made my experience so great! Plus he was just all round a great service provider and fun to talk too. So thank you Josh I hope you get some to read this or someone acknowledges you because you were awesome!

I unfortunately have been going to paulenes for a while now due to the convenience of it being close to home. I have since found a new location for my nail care needs. The manager/owners wife Annie was always extremely rude to me and others as I began to witness. She messed up a reservation I made for the day before my wedding for 8 pedicures and manicures. And refused to give me the girls I wanted. That was my final straw. All the girls don't know how to do fun designs at most you'll get a decent looking flower on your toe. God forbid you bring in a picture from Pinterest. I have had girls shake their head at me if I ask for anything mildly out there. I don't recommend this place to anyone if you are looking for a relaxing good vibe. But if you do chose to come here ask for Trish and good luck.

Had an excellent experience with Dr.Cassidy he was very professional and personable. He made our two years old feel comfortable and the office staff was very friendly.  I do agree that this place could use a deep cleaning and some new wait room furniture but other than that the experience overall was great.

Had me get blood work done a year ago that cost $25 for a draw fee. They then proceed to tell patients that the lab will eat the rest of the cost. Delighted to have a full panel done I told my family about it and had them all come in to get the panel done. Well turns out they don't have a deal with the lab and now several members of my family are facing a $4000 bill. When I had called about it they refuse to help. DO NOT TRUST THEM! Absolutely horrible what they are doing to their patients.   And to top it off I did an internship here and that was the icing on the cake. I almost gave up on my career goals after being treated so horribly. Luckily I found a long term place of employment and doctors who treat their staff with respect.

Scottsdale station has become my favorite place to dine. Their menu is quite large and I have tried quite a bit on it and never had anything I did not like. The steak blue diablo has to be my favorite meal. Sunday brunch is also great! The possibilities are endless, from the extensive drink menu to global cuisine you cannot go wrong. Tammie has been my waitress several times and she is great! My husband and I have become one of her regulars and have enjoyed every minute of it!
