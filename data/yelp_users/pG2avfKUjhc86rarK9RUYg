My grandparents recently moved and were in need of some shutters for the giant bay windows in their living room. One of my colleagues recommended we meet with Boyd from Boyd's Blinds and Drapes. I'm so glad we listened! He definitely didn't disappoint. Boyd came to the consultation prepared with samples and pictures of his work, and we new right then he was the right person for the job. The new shutters look fantastic, provide the perfect amount of style and privacy and my grandparents were so excited to support a local small business.
