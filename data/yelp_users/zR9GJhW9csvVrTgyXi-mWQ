Above and beyond. My boyfriend and I were driving from Tempe, AZ to Yuma , AZ and had to go through the town of Mauricio's. It was 8:15 at night and we both wanted coffee for the road. We stopped at Bashas and they were closer and sent us to Frys. When we arrived Fry's Starbucks was closing also! Oh no. The lady behind the counter asked what we needed and if she hadn't cleaned it yet she would make it. This woman, Theresa Reeder, went above and beyond customer service and made our drinks with a smile. We were so grateful. I got my tummy warm peppermint mocha and my bf got his iced white mocha. We tried to tip her and she refused! Wouldn't let us! So I am writing this review to let you all know that her small act of patience and kindness made my night and she really knows how to provide great customer service! We will stop here for now on during our road trips to Yuma. Thank Theresa!

I do not know about all these other people on here having bad service, but ours was amazing. We had just finished watching the Avengers, and we were starving. Very few places were open. We tried Cadillac Ranch, and they turned us away with bogo appetizer cards, because they had a buy out. We then went to some Mexican food place, which had Horrible service, and A horrible vibe, so we walked out. Then we came across Thirsty Lion Pub & Grill.   Mind you it was late at night. 10 pm. And even though they were going to be closing in an hour (Sunday night 11pm), they treated us with amazing service. Our waiter was so nice, chatty, but respectful to give us space. Knowledgeable about our wines and drinks. And the food was absolutely amazing. I am a HUGE customer service person, and there are many stores I refuse to shop at because the girls/boys/ cashiers were very mean and rude.   We can not wait for our family to visit, as this is a new place we would love to show them, and take them to eat. The menu is awesome, but the waiter did mention to steer clear of any of the sushi, as their cooks are trained to prepare it, but not skilled. BUT EVERYTHING else on the menu is 5 stars.

WORST PIZZA I have ever ordered and had delivered. I just got a new job today, I do not normally eat pizza, but was feeling great, and felt like I could splurge. I was going to go to Classic Italian Pizza, but thought I would try Rosati's Pizza since they were closer to my house. What a fool I was. I ordered a Med. pizza, with pineapple, olives, and pepperoni, and received a cheese pizza barely sprinkled with anything. What a let down, especially since I had waited so long for the pizza. Four of the pieces were pathetic. A piece had 1 pineapple on it, another piece had 2 olives, a third piece had NO INGREDIENTS on it except the cheese, and the fourth piece had half a slice of salami. Not only were ingredients lacking but, the crust was also burnt on a quarter of it. I would of done better picking up a cheap $5 pizza from pizza hut. I will NEVER order from here again.   Besides the pizza, the delivery guy didn't even ask if I wanted peppers, cheese, or even leave me napkins! what the hell! Never again, never ordering here again.
