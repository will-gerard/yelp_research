Horrible experience...filled out my application made it clear on what I wanted and how much I had as a down. Finance guy comes back with a down of 4-5 times what I had told them what I had. Next they try to get me to start trading firearms for 1/2 of their value. They even asked me if I a led/lcd tv cause their sales manager wanted one for his office. The sales guy kept calling my office and wouldn't even call my cell#.

Have bought 5 vehicles from these guys and I am now done...Sales and Finance like to play "Yo-yo" games and I am done with it. In 2012 I bought a brand new chevy Malibu from them at the their Tent event. a week later, on my birthday they called me in to tell me they needed $1400 more in cash from me. I got them down to $500 and walked out after 4 hours on my birthday.  Then my wife and I bought a new 2013 Spark from them and used her paid-off car in March, no problems. Now in July I start receiving letters from GM telling they and Chapman want to buy back my Malibu. So, I call and make an appointment. After 4 hours there, I get told that the Truck they can make work for me, is unavailable (as the fleet manager wouldn't let it go) and I walk away empty handed. Then 2 weeks later they call me asking me to comeback in and see if they can make it work again, so I agree. I went down there and spent another 4+ hours. Finally came to a deal, and left happy. Today I get a call from Travis, telling me I need to come down and visit him or Jim, I asked him straight up if they were going to ask for more money. Travis tells me that they couldn't get some of the money for the trade-in and now I HAVE to come see them ASAP....  So in my opinion, unless you have your own financing, these guys will try to squeeze you even after the deal. So I have cleaned out the truck and am ready to take back my car.   Sure enough, got to the dealership and all they wanted was 3-4k in cash. Told them sorry didn't have it and rather than try to find out if some other car might work, they just said ok we will get your old car pulled around...45 minutes later my car arrives, is on empty and has been stickered for them to sell. Was missing center console wall pieces, made them pull one from another vehicle. But they refused to put any gas in it, even though the truck came back with a full tank. So after waiting 30 minutes after the scheduled appointment for someone to talk to me, then another 45 minutes just to bring my car out to me.   So, after 5 purchases and a referral sale, I am really not sure this company is even worth the Chevy Brand.

Great cider, thats about it...just left after sitting there and being ignored. 1st we get told the apetizer will take the same amount of time as the main dish. Then we spilled a drink, had to wait 2 passes of our waitress to get her attention. When we finally did, she said she would be right back with a towel. 15 minutes later, she has taken 3 more orders in front of us and no towel. We ask to cancel our order and get tje check, only to be told your meal is ready. We refused the meal and paid for our drinks and left a 0 tip. Great to be ignored and left with a soggy table.

Been trying to leave messages and when I there none of the workers can give me a way to reach management...for the last 2 months they have double billed me, I am suppose to pay 19.95 per month. Instead they charge my card 34.95. Every time i call there phone, it says "memory full". And the employees claim to not know when or how their managers/owners work.

I have been shopping in this store since I became of age to purchase firearms...that's 1993. And have bought more firearms than I can remember, and was there today for a trade/purchase.   The owner and his staff have always been respectful to me and my family. They have worked with both my mother and my wife to find the right weapon for them and their needs. They have helped me to find the best fitting first rifles for my children, and have gone the extra mile to locate the obscure requests I have made in the past.  One of the biggest draws I have to this store, is that the staff to always up for good conversation/educational chats. Unlike some stores where everyone is afraid of Corporate management and their sales quoted/up-sale requirements, these guys and gals would rather make the customer happy and make a return customer out of them.

Great place...was served fast, staff was pleasant, and lunch food was wonderful...  This is a huge turnaround from 2 years ago, when they were a buffet style place. Now it is menu driven food. Also the place is much cleaner and inviting inside.
