This is w/out a doubt the worst food I've had since I've been living in Phoenix. I gave it 2 stars, because the service was great, although the constant refilling of my water was getting a bit annoying. The food is not authentic, I had the Puerto Rican combo, which none of the food on there was even worth eating, while the hubby ate some traditional Cuban food, which was traditional tasting.   Wont be going here or recommending this place to anyone, unless they're thirsty.

Visited today after the hubby went with his co workers for lunch. I have to say, I'm impressed. Service was great, the food was excellent, happy hour specials are every day and even my son finished his food. When we were leaving, we saw one of my husband's co worker's who is particularly picky when it comes to Mexican food...so he def must've approved because he came back with his wife!  We'll def be back again.

I received a gift certificate for this salon for a facial and a massage. I made my appointment, was called the week of my appointment to change the time, I was fine with this. I go the day of my appointment, and it had been cancelled. No phone call the day before, no apology, nothing.   I made another appointment, didn't receive a call to confirm the appointment, so this time I called the day of an hour before my appointment to verify that it was still scheduled; it was. I get the the salon, wasn't offered water or anything (but the ppl that arrived after me were offered something). After 10 mins, the receptionist tells me that my facial had been cancelled, because the esthetician who was supposed to do it, had put me under another person and that new esthetician had just called out and had no knowledge of my appointment.   Confused? Yeah, so was I.   The receptionist then tells me that they are going to make me another appointment and that she will see that the manager offers me something for free, given that I've made 2 appointments and both have been cancelled. She also mentioned that the manager would be calling me that day. I'm still waiting to hear back from the manager of the salon. If it wasn't for the gift certificate, I wouldn't be returning to this place. As far as recommendations, there are plenty of better salons, with much better customer service in Chandler or Gilbert.

So I went in for my appointment... this was my final one and if the salon messed this one up, I wasn't coming back, gift certificate or no gift certificate.   I was greeted immediately  and offered champagne or a mimosa, then taken to a back room to relax. My masseuse was excellent, she was young, knew what she was doing and we had a great conversation throughout the massage session. Then came my facial and she was also awesome. She explained what she wanted to do, asked my concerns and went straight to work. My face still feels great!   At check out, I did tip and was offered 2 $15 off coupons to come back. I may consider it, but we'll see! They did redeem themselves after my 2 horrible first experiences.

I had my car aligned at Just Brakes, they were able to squeeze me in at the last minute. Their employees and manager are friendly, honest and hard working. I had to bring my car in 2 more times, because my car hadn't been aligned correctly (new tires and steering wheel was off), the manager, without hesitation, took my car back and got it done quickly and efficiently. Would def recommend this business to anyone.

Went here, after we got a housewarming gift card from our realtor. Foor was surprisingly delish! We ordered, again, bruschetta and a deep dish pizza.  Had the beer sampler, since I'm not big on hops, this wasn't my thing, but they do make their own root beer, which is just as yummy! For desert we had oreo deep dish cookie, served w/ 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream and whipped cream (YUM).  Only thing is, the waitress seem to "forget" something you asked for...1st time we went, they "forgot" my drink, 2nd time, I asked for ranch dressing and she "forgot", I had to ask another waiter...  Go online to find a $5 coupon...its well worth it!

After disappearing from the whole church movement, a friend of mine suggested that I attend Cornerstone. Of course, I was hesitant at first, because I dont like ppl pushing their beliefs and thoughts onto me. I am who I am, no questions asked and if I like something, then I will try it.   After looking at the CS website, I went with my friend to a service. I was literally BLOWN AWAY. First its huge, the people, everyone, are all so friendly there, yes there's a little coffee center, similar to Starbux, the service is great, it talks abt everyday life...and all the studies, ministries, etc they have... cant ask for more.

I recently bought a great coupon book, that has discounts for everything imaginable in my area. I figured, since we're new to this part of the Valley, I'd buy it (not to mention the $$ goes towards a great cause).  Went to BWW's, after driving past it a couple of times....should've done exactly that, keep on driving.   We decided to use our buy 1 sampler, get one free... Sat at the bar, with some old horny drunk next to me, trying to hit on all the girls. We ordered the BBQ sandwich sliders and a sampler platter (onion rings, boneless wings, nachos, mozzarella sticks w/3 dipping sauces). Hubby ordered some beer and I drank a "berry" lemonade.   Got our drinks which BTW, were not that good...beer wasn't as "hoppy" as my husband would've liked it to be, he asked the bartender which was a better choice and she was useless. My lemonade tasted like crap...my next order was water.  Food got to us, but we had no utensils or napkins, had to ask for those. Onion rings were really good, mozz sticks were ok as well... wings...isn't this what this place is known for... they were mediocre. Tried the sliders...I've had better pulled pork (like the one I make or Famous Dave's).   Once we were done eating, I had to ask for my bill abt 3x's. Thankfully we had that coupon, because if it was up to me, I wouldn't have paid squat!   I was contemplating giving the rest of the coupons that I had for this place, to the guys next to me...we won't be needing them.

Wow!!! This is the BEST chicken I've had ever! The waffles are amazing. After telling some people abt the restaurant, everyone had a comment to say, but the combo is really good. You aren't mixing the waffles w/syrup and chicken; I mean realistically you can, but they taste so good individually that you you'll savor every bite!   I'm going to bring the hubby here! So yummy!

As if going through the process of buying a house isn't stressful enough, having a crappy title company is even worse.   I should've gotten the hint, when the title company told me they were going to send a courier to pick up the earnest check for our house. Waited, waited, waited some more... by 4p, I called the title company again, and their response was a surprised one:   "*gasp*, the courier hasn't been by yet, oh my! Well maybe they'll stop by on Monday".  Um, yeah, that's not professional! Don't tell me something and then not do it (one of my pet peeves)! So many papers, so many deadlines that they asked from us, and when it comes time for the title company to do something in return, they weren't as quick to respond.   Closing day...got a call from the title company at 10:43a, "Hi, can you and your husband be at our office by 12:30p to sign your paperwork, oh and bring at least $200 extra, just in case there are some unforeseen fees we haven't add. Thanks!"  Mind you, I work in Central City Phx, my hubby works in Scottsdale.... AND we still had to get a certified check or money order.   Got to the closing, our Realtor was there, the notary was there...title company, no where in sight (and it was in their building). Started signing papers, read them first and saw, pages after pages of our names misspelled (letters added, letters intertwined, other spellings of our names), it was endless. The notary's response... just cross out the misspelled name (or word) , date it and write out the correct spelling. That's real reassuring....such an important document, signing our lives away for the next 30 years and the title company wasn't in sight, to take back the papers, correct the spellings of our names, reprint the papers and have us sign them.   Sheesh... every time the notary left to ask the title company a question, our Realtor would look at us and apologize...  So, in end, avoid this like the swine flu...Ask your Realtor or broker who the title company is and if you are able to change it, do so.

Went here after a yr of living in the E. Valley area. Not bad, the directions from the website are crappy, price is worth it, but then again, you can bring your own tube, drive to the top, and float down...Prices are $15 for the tube and bus (to the top, back to the parking) or $12 for those who bring their own tubes and just need a ride. Cash only!!  Tubes for the coolers are the same price ($15), bring towels or old sheets to cover your tubes, because they do get hot and water shoes.. flip flops, will flop off your feet.   It's a good relaxing time w/ friends and family, ignore the drunks, unless you plan to drink also. Just make sure you have a DD, because the sun beating down on you, along w/the long, floating time, will make you quite drunk. Oh and try to go on a weekday.. not weekend... its packed w/ stupid college kids that think that being drunk is the best, exciting time of their lives... other than that enjoy!

This place is amazing! The food is great, fresh and tasteful! The service is awesome, they make you feel as though you have been friends for a long time and the prices are reasonable.   I had a hamburger that was apparently marinated or cooked w/wine, followed by a Mexican Chocolate Latte, it was great!   I'll def. be back for more

I got my 2nd tattoo at Divinity and loved the way they took great detail to what I specifically wanted on my body. Tony was great and showed me 3 different designs to my unique drawing. After he got me situated, he started my tattoo and was done in no time. He offered advice as to the aftercare for the next couple of days and more specifically what I should do for long term. I will definitely be going back and will be taking my husband to get his first!

As a native to Philly, I need to have my cheesesteak fix. Service was fast, food was good (although its not an original cheesesteak) and the prices weren't bad either. Their curly fries w/ a side of ranch are the best!   Can't wait to go back to try their wings.

Went here after a friend suggested it. Haven't been able to find great sushi, since we came back from visiting Japan. I have to say that this place is great. The service is wonderful, the sushi chef is great, they have great drink specials and the food is amazing.   I couldn't believe how fresh the fish was and how knowledgeable about the variety of sushi and sashimi the chef was (amazing accent too, he's from Spain and raised in Costa Rica).   The location is a little out of place, even my GPS couldn't find it...but the location made it very quaint!!!  They have the freshest fish/seafood around, actually they have the freshest fish/seafood I've had, since visiting Japan and eating the sushi there!! Hands down, it's the best sushi, service and atmosphere in the East Valley area.

The food is great, fresh and very tasteful... the service, not so much. As another person reviewed here, the wait staff takes your order, asks if you are ordering dessert and then takes the check... No "how is your food, can I bring you more water, would you like parm cheese w/your pizza". Nothing!!!  I've never been to a restaurant that has that much LACK of service, its amazing how many people actually come back for more bad service, I guess its because of the food, which I can understand. We had Divola pizza, great fresh cheese, salami and fresh tomatoes. For dessert we ordered a freshly made crepe, w/ marscarpone cheese and nutella.. it was heavenly!  The owners, an older couple, are very friendly and very into their place. I guess someone should complain to them about their wait staff.

Went there for lunch, the prices are great and they have a large variety of burgers, hot dogs and sandwiches, but the place is just....I don't even know how to describe it.   You order in this little shack, they accept card, but only for the food, if you order a drink, then it's cash only (this includes the canned sodas).   So we walked around the premises while our food was cooked. The animals they have there (some donkeys, chickens and 2 roosters) were all sickly looking. The donkeys had wounds, as did the chickens/roosters, but the chickens were pulling their feathers off. Sad.   We got our food, a pulled pork sandwich, a bacon, chilli, cheese burger and a side of beans. The pulled pork and side of beans were great, however the burger was so dry. I couldn't even finish it, I even added condiments on it, but still... the green hatch chilli's tasted like pickles, so that turned me off even more. We drank water, because we don't carry cash and they don't have a kids menu.

I waddled in here at 7mths pregnant with my husband to look at cars, back in Feb 2011. We were immediately greeted and asked which car we were looking for. The salesperson was young, inexperienced and knew nothing about the car we were looking for. Every time we pointed something out in the car, he sounded amazed by all the features it had. Our intent was never to purchase, just to look. After MANY hours there, with number crunching and negotiating the price, my husband was ready to leave and this mama to be needed to eat! The general manager then sat with us, asked us specifically what was the most we could pay and came back with that price, in addition he gave us a higher trade in value for my vehicle and I got to take my new car home that night.   The showroom and amenities are great (they even have a play area for kids), they offer complimentary water, fruit and coffee, free wi-fi, they have a nail salon and guys can go to a barber while waiting for your vehicle to be serviced! Service is good, a little slow though. For example the oil changes are claimed to be 1hr of service...when you go with toddler who cannot stay still, an hour seems like an eternity. Usually it's more than an hour. The service people that are assigned to you, are awesome, they will listen to every detail (especially coming from a gal who really doesn't know much of cars) and will look into it.   def recommend this dealership!

Where or where do I begin with this HORRIBLE, MONOPOLIZING, DISRESPECTFUL, ANNOYING, PAIN IN THE BEHIND cable company.   In the past month, I've emailed Cox 4 times and called them about 6 times (including one hang up from their customer service rep today). Yay, just what I wanted!  It all started when we moved from the East Coast, Comcast offers the same bundle package (internet speed is higher and phone is unlimited calls, both incoming and outgoing, long distance, caller I.D, call waiting, On Demand actually works, HD box is free and more channels than I can even list); all this for $99 a month!!!!!   So we move here, I call Cox, first bill $120... internet is slow as hell, cable channels suck and we're being charged for HD channels. Call them, for the internet speed we normally had, we're paying more. Asked to have some other channels, so called variety tier, which was included w/ Comcast, here it's $12 additional a month and caller ID on our home phone (which we don't use).   Fast forward 9mths later, I email them to ask them what I need to do in order to transfer our current services, from our apartment to our house. Received an email from them, it's free, just go to this link, type in your new home address, and bam, your services will be transferred!  It can't possibly be this simple!? 2.5 hrs later, I kept getting an error message from their website. I was tired, next day was moving day, off to bed. Next morning I call them, talk to customer service rep, tells me that unfortunately our services cannot be transferred to our new house via internet. That we would have to have a tech come by and to top it off, it'll be $30. WTF??? It's the SAME SERVICES, why am I going to be charged $30 to transfer our services?!  Techs come by the next day, phone is installed, but we can't receive calls...we can make them, but not receive them. Call Cox, let them know, phone gets fixed. Get about 30 telemarketing calls in less than 24 hrs... call Cox again, try to find out what to do to make our ph # unlisted; apparently it's $5 to install and $2 a month (1st customer service rep said it was free)... contradicting again!  So again, I email them, tell them about the inconsistency, from the transfer of service, the phone situation and how much I hate Cox.   Get a call from the main office, they tell me that they'll waive the $30 install fee and the $5 unlisted # fee, but that the monthly fee for our phone to be unlisted is going to be $2. Ok whatever, go ahead...  Less than 3 days later (today), I call to ask what I can do to lower our bill, can I take off the variety tier or reduce my ph, since we don't use it for anything... no because it'll cost you $28 more a month.   That's B.S! I'm deleting a service. Apparently, the so called bundle package, OBLIGATES you, the hardworking, paying customer, to be stuck w/ this so called bundle package. Called again to ask how this is possible, got hung up on... so I tell my hubby, that he'd better call to resolve this issue, because if I call or email them one more time, I will be cursing up a storm.   Needless to say, as soon as Comcast Cable comes down to the East Valley (Phoenix Metro area) I will be switching, promoting and campaigning for EVERYONE to change. I'll be saving about $53 a month when I switch to Comcast!

Came here w/ the hubster's. I've actually been craving this for some time now. The pollo fundido is great! So goooooood! Its a pretty big portion. The rest of the food looks really fresh too. The best part is that they have churros!   Great prices and food!

Can't say too much about the burgers... a bit over priced, I've def. had better burgers. The grease was, literally, dripping from the burger. The fries were tasteless, the buns were a bit stale. I'd rather go across the street to In-n-Out, drive 7 miles to Joe's Farm Grill or even better, drive to Four Peaks Brewery in Tempe.

Love this place, love their employees and the services they give. Prices are a bit high, but I guess I can't complain, esp when you get a package.   Microdermabrasions are the best here! Very relaxing, and your skin feels wonderful! Their website offers great deals (private message me, so I can refer you, I'm pretty sure there's a discount)

Of course I would give Sephora 5 stars and even more for this location. Like the other reviewers have mentioned, this Sephora is a lot better than the one in the Scottsdale mall. Employees are great here, very knowledgeable, and eager to help. I like the fact that they are able to give me ideas for the products that I am going to buy, in addition to letting me know about other products.   While there's a JCP being constructed near our house, with a Sephora inside, it's obviously not going to be as good or stocked as the one in the mall (besides the points aren't added).

What a great find! We went here after buying a coupon book, saw the reviews and decided to give it a try. Have to say, we're really impressed. As soon as we sat down, the waitress came over w/ cups for soda or tea and a small platter of these delicious garlic knots...OMGosh!!! So freaking good! We ordered our pasta, came w/ a salad and bread. The owner's wife brought our dinner. We were honestly not expecting that much food to be served. We couldn't finish our meal, however we did order some delicious cannoli's! They were great too!   Can't wait to try their pizza!

Went here again a couple of times and it has gotten worse. It takes forever to be seated.   We ordered a pizza the last time we were here and the crust was bland, the pizza was dripping with grease, so much that we had to soak it up with napkins and the service was slow, mediocre and unpleasant.   We won't be coming back. Spinato's is way better.

OMG!!! that's what comes to mind when you taste the food here! Fresh, fast service, atmosphere is great, even the bathroom are cool!  I had the B-B-Q chicken pizza, which was to die for! Nice crispy crust, lots of chicken, w/green onions and of course B-B-Q sauce. The hubby had their bacon w/ blue cheese burger, which was equally as good. After walking the grounds for 1/2 hr to get our meal down, we ordered a chocolate shake.. yummy!!! This place is a real treat!

Def. a fan and will def. come back. Went here about a week ago, had their seasonal strawberry beer... YUM!!!! I want to come back to get a growler! Food was great, had bruschetta, wings and pizza. Can't go wrong w/ that. If you buy the pint glass, your beer is 1/2 off. The glasses are unique, so you can make a collection. Needless to say, I'll be going there to see what new glasses they have.   If you go on their website, they have different activities going on throughout the week. Thursdays is quizzo...for those who don't know what this is, random questions, drinking beer and answering them while your tipsy or drunk. A great combo! Not sure if there's a prize, but I'll find out sure enough! Another great thing that SanTan does, is TNT (Tuesday Night Tasting), where they pair foods and beer, great atmosphere and you get to meet great ppl who love beer.   The brew master is awesome and the servers are great! Can't say enough of SanTan!

Burgers are good, I like that I can choose as many toppings as I want, esp. when they have avocado! Haven't had their shakes yet, but I'm debating when I go next time. Fries, I can do without, although I havent tried their rings.   Again, I'd rather go to Four Peaks, but when I'm at the Marketplace, I guess this is better than eating at the overly expensive Paradise Bakery!

I have an update, because as my lease is ending, I really need to say some things about this place.  I've officially been living her for a year. The grounds keepers/maintenance crew are the best, most humble people you will ever know. Regarding the office staff, seems like they want to turn a blind eye towards all the problems the good residents are complaining about, in order to keep the rioting college kids, who bring their friends every weekend. Besides the fact that there is construction going on in a warehouse behind the apt., they work 24/7, noises all the time... I'll list the problems, that not only I've had, but that others have too.  1- We're trying to buy a house, instead of just letting us know that 'hey, your lease is almost up, you haven't been a problem resident, you don't have to pay extra to break your lease'; We were told that if we break our lease, we have to pay the months rent that we are living here, $1660.00 to break the lease, PLUS pay back the incentive we received when we moved here. What kind of B.S is that!? Needless to say, we're buying, moving and still paying rent here...and I will CONTINUE to use all their amenities (pool, movie theater, etc until my lease is up).  2- My hubby and I rent a garage, monthly, because there aren't enough parking spots for all the residents, because there are so many freakin' college kids/friends over, that residents have to look/scrounge for spots. Anyway, we rent a garage, expensive I might add, my husband likes working on cars, is knowledgeable, blah, blah.  I had the courtesy to ask the office, if he could work on my car, as it needed a new clutch, among other things. We were told NO. Ok, so I went ahead and paid almost $3000 to get my car worked on. Lately I've been seen residents change their oil, work on their cars and motorcycles (both in the garages AND in carports). So again I complained and I wrote the manager a LONG email about why its unfair, that they ignore these residents, but yet don't take into consideration that I asked, etc. They response was that they haven't seen anyone, so they cant say anything. B.S! I've even given them the license plates of the people working on their cars, no EXCUSES! Grrrrr!  3- Dog poop: this has been on going and on going. People here pay extra to have their dogs. Fine, I'm a dog person, love dogs, cant wait to get one. But if I did have one here, whenever my dog went out for a poop, I'd clean it up (the apt even provides the baggies). No, there's dog poop EVERYWHERE! Be careful if you are drunk, cant see well at night, etc because you will step on dog poop. You know who cleans it up, maintenance/grounds keepers, they aren't even the owners of the dogs!!! They keep a tally on who the owners are, the office has pics of the dogs that live in the complex, etc. and NOTHING is being done. These sick a$$ owners want a dog, but don't clean up after them... I can only imagine how disgusting their apts must be!  4- (And I swear this will be my last rant)- Drunken people: If you're going to live here, please be aware that you will feel like you're living in a dorm. I'm no longer at the point of my life where I want to be woken up by some drunk girl, crying because her boyfriend looked at another girl at the club, SHUT UP! The pool has hours from 7a-12a, people bring their friends over, drunk off their a$$es and those that live around the pool area, have to listen to all this, they complain to management and NOTHING is done about it. We even have a security guard, where is he? Sleeping in the office or his car? Management knows EXACTLY who these people are, because its always the SAME people!!!!!!! and do nothing about it.   Ok, like I said last rant, I'm so over this place, too expensive, there are no more community events, as the budget was cut, now they want residents to pay for some guy to come and cook, it's like living in a dorm, and for every ignorant resident they have, they'll be loosing 3. Can't wait to leave!  (Sorry it was so long and the actual rating I want to give is 2.5 stars)

Went here w/ a couple of co-workers yesterday and about 2 weeks ago, for lunch. Food is good, their pastas are yummy, sandwiches are good too... prices... eh.. they could be lower. The service is fast, no wait staff to deal with or tip. The prices are not less than $7 as someone else mentioned in their review. Be prepared to spend $10-13 for your lunch. Good thing I pack the 4 of the 5 work days!

Oh the sorrow...   What can I say, I was expecting more. I had gone to another Benihana's in New Jersey, but we only went to the Teppanyaki part of it. I signed up online to get alerts for specials and such, so I got a $30 certificate for my birthday.   Went here Friday, with the hubster, because I called to see when their all you can eat sushi was. Luckily its everyday! Couldn't wait to have our massage and sushi date night!   Now, we've been to Japan, have had awesome sushi, love 202 Crazy Fish Sushi in Tempe and decided to try Benihana's...big mistake. I should've learned after we had gone to Kabuki, knowing that it's a chain and that the sushi is, well, bad. The variety was good, the fish wasn't its freshest fish and who puts mayo on their sushi? Why does this happen at chains? The sushi chef was Japanese, as was our waitress, so we talked to her a bit abt our visit to Japan, my sister in law, etc. But the sushi was warm, fell apart and the fish, bland...I'll just stickl w/ Crazy Fish, who does his sushi with love and knows what my husband and I like.

Besides being my neighbors, they are great photographers! The way they make their clients feel comfortable, the ideas that they bring to the table and their artwork is amazing.   I love their candid shots! They do random photo shoots for their neighbors and we recently did a shoot with them. They're great, I can't say anything but good things about them!

Went in trying to get a quick, bite to eat, and seriously, I was contemplating asking for a refund. It was like eating cardboard w/imitation cheese. To top it off, it was expensive. Now I don't mind paying for food, as long as it's good, but this was ridiculous!   Don't go here, unless every single restaurant off Baseline Rd is in foreclosure, you're starving and will pass out if you don't eat something soon... you're better off going to the Fry's Supermarket next door and eating something from there.

It's funny how life changes when you get married, or have a child or even buy a house...I used to detest going to Home Depot, so much that it would make me nauseous and sleepy. I would avoid going here like it was a plague.   We just bought a house (WOO HOO) and we've spent nearly every weekend, at least 1-2x in the same day at the Home Depot. So much so, that the people working there, like the paint people, know us!!!  I don't know what the requirements are to work there, I don't know if they have to have a background in handy man (woman) 201, but they really know their stuff. Always very helpful, very knowledgeable and the paint ppl...there's not much I can't say! I've brought the same gallon of custom paint, 2x, and wanted them to change the color, because the one I had originally chosen, doesn't look good on my walls. No worries, they will adjust the paint until it's to my liking!  Did I mention they accept competitor's coupons! I love the Home Depot...maybe my outlook will also change for auto parts stores.

5 stars is stretching it...I don't like going to dentists...I despise them, I've spent so much $$ on my teeth, that I've told my husband and friends, that the oral surgeon should just pull all my teeth out and get me dentures!  On 08/06/09, I spent 6 HOURS at Creative Smiles... I took a day off at work to get a bunch of stuff done on my teeth (this included molding for my new retainer and zoom whitening). I was there from 7-11:30a and then again from 1p-3p. My husband had an appointment that same day...2hrs, bam, out...  The hygienist, assistants and dentist are great, they will do anything to keep you off of pain, and to keep your mind off the torture. I had taken a Valium, had laughing gas and a bunch of shots of novocain. They gave me a blanket, headphones and I was able to watch 2 movies during my first half of torture. I was so drugged up, that I got sick to my stomach. Finished the first half and then came back and watched another movie and got my reward w/ my zoom.  I like the fact that they are very thorough with their job, explaining everything. The only downside is that they are open a couple of days in the week... not including Friday's, which are my days off (reason why, I gave 4 stars). Oh and they have free jewelry cleaning and hand paraffin!

Came here during happy hour once, service was bad, the waitress had a look on her face like she didn't want to be there, much less wait on us. I knew I shouldn't have come back...but I did, I wanted to give them a 2nd chance.   Went today with my son for lunch, after standing around for a while, someone finally saw us and sat us down. Took our order and then I started swatting flies, left and right. That's right, there were flies there constantly.   Service this time wasn't bad, but it wasn't good. Our waitress disappeared for a long time, I didn't get any extra napkins (I only got one), finished eating our food and waited around some more until we finally got our check.   Forgot to even mention the food...you can find better food elsewhere, it's not even worth mentioning. Totally unforgettable food.  We won't be coming here again. Oregano's and BLD are in the same area, will go there, before stepping in here again.

Great customer service, close to the airport. Pick up from the airport was a breeze and the pricing was great. We'll be using Blue Sky whenever we travel.

Went here for lunch with a friend and my son of the first time. Server was good, nothing out of the ordinary. My sons food came out first. it was good, he ordered the mac and cheese. my friend and I ordered the Manager's Special from the lunch menu.   Food was ehhhh.. literally. It lacked flavor, and spices. I didn't even finish my meal and that's saying a lot. I ordered my sons ice cream so he could have it before we left. The ice cream tasted like it had been stuffed in the back of the freezer and they had to pry it out of a snowmans hands to get a scoop for my son. It was so bad that my son didn't even finish it.   My advice, save your money, go to the grocery store and make your own meal, you'll get better service, food and leftovers at home.

If I could give Spinato's 10 stars I would! That's how much we like this place. Their food is always delicious, the service is great and I'm oh so happy that they opened one closer to my house.   They have daily specials, a great kids menu and awesome desserts. Their pizza is amazing (you can order 1/2 and 1/2 for their toppings), their pasta is super yummy, but our fav is by far the calzones! Those are to die for! We came here a lot when I was pregnant and after our baby was born, we went back with him...they gave him his first Spinato's shirt!  If you go to the Tempe location, you won't be able to get pasta, just an FYI.

Have you been here? No? Then GO!!!!   They have an awesome beer selection from local, AZ, breweries as well as other breweries. Their food is A-MAZING. Seriously, so good. We've been here 2x and both times it was excellent.   It's kid and dog friendly. You seat yourself and the beer selection is written on a chalkboard. They have brunch, and if you go, try the french toast and the breakfast burrito. OH MY, sooooo good! For $10 you get a beer (or mimosa) and whatever they are serving for brunch. Dogs are welcomed in their back patio. They also sell growlers, score!  Service was awesome, both our waiter and the manager came to our table several times.   We'll def be returning soon!

Service is great, restaurant is clean, my advice: do NOT eat here.   Food is very mediocre, I've had better food at the local Panda Express or better yet spend your $$ across the street at YC's Mongolian Grill.

Holy cow is this some yummy BBQ. Hubby went on opening day and stood around in the AZ sun, just to get some grub. He's been talking abt it ever since. We went today as a family and he was NOT kidding!   The ribs, the pulled pork, the pudding...HEAVENLY. There are no plates and everything is served on a plastic tray with butcher wax paper. So don't come here expecting to not get messy. Bring your wet naps, grab some napkins or wash up at their wash station...if you don't like messy, don't come here. They also have a mini bar with condiments, a large assortment drinks (including beer) and plenty of seating indoor and out.   We've found our new BBQ place! Can't wait to try the rest of the things on the menu! Yummy yummy in my tummy!

Not sure why all the reviews about this being a 'legit' Mexican place... because it's not. Filibertos is more authentic than Nando's.   We went there for dinner and ordered a house margarita, a cheese crisp for the little one and a mini combo platter. The margarita tasted like soap, no lie it had bubbles, the cheese crisp was good, our son ate sufficiently and the mini combo platter, yeah that sucked big time. The meat and tortillas tasted funny, it had cheese overload and the only thing good from it were the mini tacos. Their chips and salsa are good and service was pretty good. Our waitress took off the combo platter, even after we told her not to (so she deserved her tip above and beyond).

We went to Proof to have dinner. I cannot express how good the service, food and desserts were. My husband had their burger, We Have the Best Burger with a side of onion rings, I had their Chicken and Waffles and our son had mac and cheese, fries, fresh fruit (kids under 4 eat free with a paying adult!!!). Let me tell you, this was SO GOOD. Everything was just above and beyond good. The chicken was fried perfectly, the waffles were a good contrast to the saltiness of the chicken, the mac and cheese was delectable, the fries were seasoned to perfection, onion rings were yummy (a little too much batter) and my husband finished his burger without a sound, so I'm assuming he loved it!   We also had dessert at their ice cream parlor. They make their own ice creams and baked goods!!! Again we were impressed!   Our waitress was so gracious and kind, I wish I had gotten her name! Also, the manager came up to our table various times and talked to our son, asking him abt his Cars, knew the names of Lightening McQueen and Mater!

Went there for an early dinner after their grand opening. Decor is ok, the restaurant has a huge stage, that's awkwardly placed in the middle of the back wall, tables sparsely placed around the restaurant. As per the menu, happy hour is everyday from 2-7p.   We ordered the beer sampler, my husband ordered the Onion Burger and I ordered the East Valley Burger. (both medium well) and mac & cheese with fries for our kiddo. Beer came and it was good, the waiter didn't really explain much of the beers, nor the seasonal, he just gave us the paper that goes with the sampler that describes the beers. They were a good size for samplers, enough for both of us to taste and have more than 4 sips each. Our son's food came, with apple slices instead of  the fries we order; the waiter came back apologetic with the fries (FYI- the restaurant has no kiddie cups or to go cups for the kids drinks, just big, glass cups. Def not kid friendly).   Our burgers came, both burgers were beyond well done, mind you we ordered them medium; we let the waiter know, but at this point we had already bitten into our flavorless burgers. Did I mention flavorless? Yes, they were; there was no seasoning whatsoever on them, they tasted like regular cooked ground beed. The onion burger claims it has horseradish cream sauce...there was less than a sliver on the burger; meanwhile the East Valley burger is described as having a cilantro lime sour cream...again a sliver, we could barely taste it. After our son was done eating, we asked for his ice cream, as it's part of his meal. The ice cream tasted like it has been sitting in the freezer for months and months. You know the kind, where there's freezer burn on your ice cream but you eat it anyway because you just have to have it...yeah that kind. Our son, who LOVES ice cream, didn't even eat it.   We then asked for our check; upon reviewing it, I noticed that we had been charged the regular price for the sampler. I asked the waiter and he said that it wasn't happy hour, so I pulled out the beer menu where it clearly states: HAPPY HOUR EVERYDAY 2-7p (and then the bottom describes what the specials are); he then went to the manager and comped (is that even a word?) , whatever, he reduced the price of the beer sampler.   Would we return? Maybe for their beers and possibly appetizers.  The service, beer selection and location is good, food...eh I've had better. However, I think I'd rather save my $$ and go to OHSO Brewery in Phoenix; and if we want a good, TASTY burger we'll go to Teakwoods.

Came here on a Saturday after I had contacted them through facebook to see if they were kid friendly...they aren't.  There's 1 high chair, no kid menu. Checked out their menu, there wasn't anything on there that I could even make a meal out of for my son. and get this, the waitress suggested fruit and fries as dinner options for my son. Really? No, thanks.   We ordered the street tacos, everything in it was cold.   Good for groups, couples and happy hour. families with kids avoid coming here. They don't have a sign up yet and it was a tad bit hard to find, the apartments behind them were shady too.   We won't be back, I'd rather drive to Phoenix and eat/drink at Ohso.

We celebrated our son's birthday here, after visiting a few times. The location is clean and well maintained, staff was professional, the kids had a blast, the food was tasty (including gluten free options) and everyone had a great time. The bday packages may seem pricey, but when you breakdown the cost of the food, drinks, entertainment, cleanup and the fact that your child cannot leave without you unless the wristband matches yours, it is totally worth the price. I would recommend Makutu's Island to anyone

Jay Culton was our realtor when we decided to purchase our first home. He asked us a list of wants/don't wants in our future house and went to work. He listened to our needs and sent us multiple listings to match our requirements. When we found our house, we knew it was the one the moment we stepped in the door. Jay walked us through the entire home buying experience and was there at closing.   Because Jay has been in the business for so long, he has a bunch of great referrals to other places, such as home improvement, landscaping, home inspection and painters. He's professional, courteous and over the years has become a friend. I recommend Jay to anyone who is looking for a home.

Purchased a groupon for this company. Called and left a voicemail to schedule an appointment, no answer. Submitted my info via their website, no response. Had to email them more than 5x in order to get them to respond to 3 of my emails. Each time, they would say that they were running late, or asked if I could do it on a certain date, which I would confirm and have no one come. Last time they emailed me on Friday, asking if Sunday or Monday could work, I replied with "what time", didn't get a response from them until late Monday morning. Contacted Groupon and got my $$ back. Do not recommend this company, unless you like the cat-mouse game they have going on.

My family found out about this preschool, by word of mouth at the last minute, for the school year 2015-2016. After talking to the director, we toured the school the same day and fell in love with the curriculum, the playground and classrooms. Besides the fact that it is one of the only Christian preschools, that is actually ran by the church.  Our child thrived at Ray of Light! They provide a positive, warm and loving teaching atmosphere,  where you know your child will be praised, learn and be safe. Most importantly they also teach about our Lord, in a manner that the children will understand. I recommend this preschool for any parent who has a child between the ages of 3-5!
