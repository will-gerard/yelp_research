i'm a basketball junkie and became a Suns fan during their amazing run in '92-'93. as a season ticket holder for 3 seasons now, the US Airways Center is almost a home away from home - only i don't have to do chores. speaking of which, the restrooms here are always squeaky clean. i've been to bigger arenas that give a whole new meaning to nose bleed section, and US Airways definately doesn't feel that way. it's as intimate as an arena for a major sports team can be and even the cheapest seats still give you a good view of the hardwood action. and who doesn't love a little hardwood action?  the food is not going to make you cheer any louder (that's what alcohol is for), but at least there are a variety of options. you got your standard arena concessions, Subway, Peter Piper Pizza, Cold Stone Creamery, Starbucks, Southwest Grill, G'Rilla Dogs and the two newest additions, Samurai Sam's and Great Steak and Potato Co.  anyways, i've been lucky enough to enjoy the arena when every game was sold out, and it's a bit depressing to see all the empty seats now. i know they haven't been as exciting as in the past years, but it's still fun to go with good friends. so please do the Suns (and me!) and huge favor and go to a game. you can get a great deal on tickets right now, especially if you buy them from season ticket holders through the Suns website. hopefully i'll see you at a game. GO SUNS!

the best part about Sun Cyclery is definitely the service. the guys working here are knowledgeable, friendly and pretty much amazing. they went above and beyond helping me find accessories for my vintage Schwinn and then made sure everything was put on properly. they even took the time out to look up what year my bike was born.   i originally came in to replace the seat but because i have a much older bike, the shop didn't have the proper equipment needed to fit and put a new one on. instead of just saying "tough luck" and sending me on my sad and seatless way, they took extra care to explain what I needed to do and where to get it done.  so if you have a bike that needs some TLC, please take it to the guys at Sun Cyclery. and if you don't have a bike, they have an awesome selection to choose from. what are you waiting for? the weather is GORGEOUS outside so let's go cruising! if all else fails, i'll let you ride on my handlebars.

although i've eaten my way through half of phoenix, this is my first review. hi all!  went here for lunch on tuesday and since it was my first time, i stuck to the basics and had the windy city slider with cheese, a milk shake and fries. my milkshake was amazing - not too thick or overly sweet and actually tasted like milk was an ingredient. imagine that! the slider was decently sized and delicious. my favorite part was the bun. oh, the bun! now my dream is to sleep on a bed made of those buns.  Chicago Hamburger Co. is the kind of place where you're constantly sneaking glances at and coveting what other people ordered. the owner is awesome. he personally brought our food to the table and made sure to stop and chit chat, even during the crazy lunch rush.   will i be back? my arteries say no, but my taste buds say YES. and who am i going to listen to? the taste buds every time. i love these kind of establishments and urge everyone to support the business and ignore their arteries as well!

i've been to Ra a few times in Arizona and California. the chain is generally located in major strip malls so it's one of those places i repeatedly stumble on while shopping or trying to kill time before a late movie.   i think Ra wants to be known as a late night hot spot as opposed to a place you can find good sushi. there's always a great patio to socialize and people watch. the service is slow and confusing because you seem to end up with about 2 or 3 different people waiting on you. the last time i was here, waitress #2 poured our sake to the point where it overflowed. unless licking sake off the table is an ancient Japanese tradition i don't know about, that's pretty crap service. as for the sushi, it doesn't stand out at all. maybe the music made it so i couldn't taste my food. yeah, it's loud to the point where both your eardrums and your taste buds are numb.  like everyone else says, go for the Happy Hour and hanging out. but take only those friends who have perfect hearing and really loud voices.

i go to Dilly's whenever i have the urge to slip into a carb coma because the portions are HUGE. we're talking one sandwich cut in half looks more like two full sandwiches.  i always build my own to load up on the veggies (gotta pretend like i'm being healthy). the best thing is, you could request everything but the kitchen sink in your sandwich and the price never changes. in fact, you could probably request they throw in the kitchen sink, and the price would remain the same. it seems to be one of the only places that doesn't charge a premium for avocado.  for people who like punch cards, Dilly's has one. as far as atmosphere, don't expect any. it gets crowded here during lunch and the service is not always friendly but always fast. it's a great place to go if you feel like wolfing down a gigantic sandwich before passing out at your desk.

i love Maxim. from the general mood of the place down to the random Christmas decorations that are never put away, it reminds me of a lot of the Vietnamese restaurants scattered throughout Little Saigon in Southern California, where the owners are originally from. some holidays, they'll take random trips back to visit, so don't be surprised if you roll up and find a handwritten sign saying that they are closed for a few days. the service is always great though, even when lunchtime diners pack the place.   i've been here lots of times but only ever get one dish - the mi (egg noodle soup) but ordered dry style so that the broth comes in a separate bowl. it's something i ate a lot in CA, but have trouble finding in Phoenix. it's not quite what i'm used to, but comes pretty damn close. if you like mi but have never tried it this way, definitely give it a go!   there are just a few things to watch out for. it's in a small strip mall so you might miss it if you blink. the parking lot can get a bit crowded and making a left turn into the lot is tricky. and for all the Thai tea drinkers out there, we found out they don't sweeten it with coconut here. other than those tiny details, maxim is an awesome place to get a good, inexpensive meal.

Harley's is the kinda place i imagine my Italian grandmother would run. that is, if i was Italian and if i had a grandmother who ran such an amazing place. a girl can dream, right? from the decor of the restaurant to the richness and portion size of food, everything screams comfort! it's definately not the place to go if you're counting calories. you could get full on the bread alone. and i love how they secure your box of leftovers with about 10 layers of saran wrap. your fridge doesn't end up smelling like italian food, and when you go to eat the leftovers, it's like opening a present. thanks grandma!

tony and lupo ("like wolf, in italian") made my experience amazing before i even had a bite of the food. they were helpful, friendly and funny and even let us cut through the kitchen to get to my car, parked in the back lot. this makes me slightly biased... then again, i consider people to be an important part of the food experience. i promised tony and lupo i would post a review on yelp, so here goes!  i was hungry like a wolf. woo, that was cheesy...kinda like the pizza... get it? cheese pizza? okay, i'll stop. i promise. :-) after going through the menu, tony urged us to try the stromboli, so we did. and boy, i'm glad we did. split between two people, it was just enough to make my tummy happy without feeling sick. at one point, it hit me that i had just bitten through pepperoni stacked about 10 slices high. yeah. a stack of pepperoni. and the dipping sauce was so good - tasted like it had fresh herbs and was just thick enough, with little chunks of tomato.  i will definately be back for more food and conversation.
