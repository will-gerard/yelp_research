I needed my suit for the big Noche de Gourmet event and since I do not wear it very often it was looking pretty wrinkled. But presto it was done -    Rich - Thanks again for getting my order done in 24 hours.

I own JC Printing in Phoenix and our main graphics computers hard drive was failing. We placed an on site inspection and Matt came out at 3 pm and returned the computer the next morning at 10 am - New hard drive and a data back-up migration done. Fixed and ready to go in less than 12 hours. - Wow - Thanks a lot

Wow what a nice night. We came in for the Wed night polenta board and it was wonderful. It consisted of rendezvous chicken with sausages and four different side toppings. Great food - great wine - great staff on top of the great deal. Only $40.

I had the biscuits and gravy with sausage. Deep fried  potatoes, sausage and kale in old smelly oil. Really anyone can deep fry. Biscuit is ok if you like military style with no flavor gravy missing any hint of sausage.

I took my Aussie, Tessa, for a couple of hours of day care.  She came back smiling and ready for a nap.  So this is really her review :) A really nice place with great gals running the show.

Stopped in for lunch today and it was great. All the food seems to be made from scratch. The four different tacos were very good and they come with chips too. Ask for the hot sriracha salsa as it has a good kick. The torta and carne fries sounded yummy.

Wow - What can I say. Great food and service. The Gluten Free pizza is the best in Phoenix. Add some sausage to the shrimp pizza for a surf and turf pie. They are also making a bunch of Hot Chile oils and the Pavuvu oil (A South Pacific Pepper) is tops. It is all about the Base!
