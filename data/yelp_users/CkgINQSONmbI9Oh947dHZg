Are you watching your weight but miss real food....well then look no further. FOOD- I have had the vegan delight pizza, which is super delicious. I also have had the spaghetti with veggie balls and the vegan ranch. You cannot tell the difference in the vegan ranch vs. real ranch and it is a fraction of the calories. Go to this place and indulge on anything on the vegan menu, which is vast. My cup of wine runneth over for the clandestine food that tricks my belly into believing it is enjoying a fatty treat, which it is not. You can access the vegan menu by going to their Facebook page rather than their website. SERVICE- The owner is kind and helpful and gets really jazzed up about the vegan menu too.  WAIT TIME- About 15 to 20 minutes. They are not miracle workers and it is pizza...

There is a place, not so far away, where the wine is delicious and the tranquil sounds of divine music play. Should you arrive at this place with a desire for stomach satisfaction, the food will provide the vehicle for your satisfaction. My family came here to have dinner prior to going to Zoo Lights. Our guide was friendly and gentle. Ryn is the best and was able to direct our choices as to food and drink. We had the pizza which was okay (a little soggy) and the vegetabe plate and the hot dogs with fries and fruit. The place is best with just you and someone that you want to pounce on (super romantic) however, they are kind to children as well.

I have been through many hair stylists and can honestly say that every time I go to this salon and see Courtney it is a relaxing occasion with a professional that knows what she is doing and aims to please. I went to the salon for color and cut and had to leave without my cut because I had to run out on another appointment. Courtney felt so bad for something that was obviously not her fault and she made sure to fit me in within a couple of days. She is amazing. Also, I have had pedicures and manicures here and loved the experience. Further, I have also had a facial, massage and spray tan at this salon and enjoyed the experience. The only down side is that they are kind of pricey for pedicures and manicures but it is well worth it when they speak English. They book out because they are all great.

After living in New York for 4 years, Italian food in Phoenix definitely pales in comparison. However, the food here was not what I had an issue with, the service was lack luster/borderline horrible. I call it my 3 hour tour, which ended instead of crashing into a foreign island, sipping a free shot of sambuca. My reservation was for 7 and I was seated almost immediately. I ordered my drink and waited a good 15 minutes before it arrived. Then I waited a close to 20 minutes before the next order of drinks arrived. This continued. Listen, I get that you are busy and it is Friday, I get it. But please have someone run drinks to their tables, a continuous flow of alcohol always keeps patrons happy, especially when the food is taking a long time. The waitress was slammed, had too many tables and VERY forgetful. If you want to spend 250 dollars, have great food and not great drinks or service, go here. Otherwise, I recommend you go to a restaurant that can accommodate you in all regards. That, or go here at a time when you are sure to miss the traffic.   My comments on the food are as follows:  -Antipasto for 2- Love, love, love! The plate is enough for 4, big portions and big flavors.  -Gnocchi marinara-Love it! Little fluffy clouds of potato wonder. Highly recommended.

The office is horrible! I got to the appointment 15 minutes beforehand to fill out paperwork. Appointment was for my 3 year old. As the time went on, my child was becoming increasingly stir crazy. My child was yelled at three times and I was glared at meanwhile it was 45 minutes before I even got called into the appointment. I asked for my money back and went somewhere else. Do yourself a favor and do the same. Major waste of time.

My husband got me a gift certificate here. My experience was horrible! All the urban legends about beastie schools are accurate. The "stylist" who dyed my hair was concerned because my scalp started bleeding. Instead of professionally handling it with brevity and discretion, she decided to roll her eyes and tell all her beastie friends to come over and look at the specimen that is my scalp. Step right up ladies and gentlemen, the circus freak with the spontaneously bleeding scalp is here! I sat in the washing chair for 45 minutes before I asked her to please remove the toner from my hair and get me out of there. I left with a worse color than what I went in with, anger and low self-esteem. Do yourself a favor and pay the extra 50 bucks to get it done right at a salon.

Sorry, me no likey anymore.  Since the commencement of the opening of Barrio, I have been enchanted by the giant fan and the cosmepolitan atmosphere. A couple of nights ago, the glass sealing was shattered for me. I arrived as usual with my husband and two small children. We waited for 5 minutes before anyone came to the hostess stand. The woman looked frazzled and put out. Sorry, that's your job, or maybe it is someone else's job and you are covering for them but, still, it is your job. I didn't get any warm fuzzies.  When we were sat at our table, our server was very receptive to our needs. SERVICE HERE IS GREAT, which is the only redeeming quality. Food and prices are not.  I ordered the "Seafood Experience," and was highly disappointed. There were two large shrimp on my plate and one fish taco with a very small portion of fish...$16.00 dollars later. The food was good but unless you are anorexic, really bad portions. If you haven't eaten for days because you are starving yourself and you think you may want to binge, try here. Because the portions will look huge to you.  Seriously, this is not tapas, it is mexican food. I feel like a fatty saying that but let's call a spade a spade. If you want some good, over-priced drinks in a bar that has a lot of old, ugly people, go here.

Do you like Rocky Point? I do, and that is why this restaurant is like a brother to me, a weird, some-what attractive step-brother:) The facade may appear shady, but let's be honest, shady is good. Good food, this place is very authentic, and good prices, I am never upset. I have been to this restaurant many times for lunch. I like coming there because there are usually only a handful of customers and I can enjoy a lot of waitress attention.  You are greeted with a free cup of seafood soup that is so yummy and full of chunks of seafood. Aye papi! Did I mention that the seafood here is phenominal! They have this appetizer called oysters el pacifico that is moi bueno! It is oysters on the half shell with shrimp, avocado and red onions, very delicious. The restaurant is run by the whole family, papa is the chef, the daughter is the notary/manager and the son (Jr.) is the renaissance man. You are always treated like family in here. WARNING: The service is slow so if you are not going to enjoy food, culture and company, please do not go.

As a parent, I am always looking for a place that can allow my husband and I to have a great meal along with our children being distracted and content. My kids are very loud and I hate places where the staff glares at you any time the laughing is too loud.  Hello, paradise found?  If you are looking for a kid-friendly restaurant with adult-friendly options (mimosas and bloody marys) this is the best place for you! My husband and I come here every Saturday morning for brunch and always leave with more toys than we came in with.  Each time we come to the restaurant, we are warmly greated. Our children, ages 1 and 3.5 are given a toy to have/play with and coloring books. The kids LOVE it here.  If you have a big family with big appetites, they have this family breakfast that says it serves 3-4 and it really serves 5-6. It is huge and has everything you could think of wanting and is ONLY 20 DOLLARS. The food is always eggscellent:) and the staff are always eager to help, if at times discombobulated.   I do want to mention that I have come for dinner once and did not have as enjoyable of an experience. Breakfast and lunch are preferred.

WARNING, do not sit on the patio. During this wonderful weather, you may be tempted to bask in the outdoors while you leisurely indulge in a mimosa or bloody mary. This restaurant is not the place to do so. For two weekends in a row I have sat on the patio only to be sorely neglected. I waited for 20 minutes to get a drink each time I sat down. This was because I discovered that the bartender outside is also the waitress for the entire patio. She is heavily bogged down and cannot accommodate patrons sitting at the tables. There were 5 of us, all four adults got their meal and were done eating when the 5th persons food finally arrived. I have no complaints about the food, but I also have no desire to give money to a place that has great food but crappy service.

Bei Bei Amigos and their sister school Arizona Language Prep are advanced for their time. If you want to get your child ahead in a global economy, a knowledge of other languages is consquential. Here, children become tri-lingual and I have never been unhappy or disappointed with any of the teachers. So send your child to this school, or read this entry with jealousy because your child will not be as smart as my children:)

I am a big sushi fan. While this place is not as creative as say Yasu up the road, I will say that it has a large wine list, Echigo, and aims to please. The first time I went here, they did not know how to make a crab sunomuno salad. By the third trip, they had specifically researched how to make it so that when I came again, I would not be disappointed and I was not. The rolls are delicious and the fish is fresh (order the scallops), when you walk in, you are not greeted by the perfume of roting fish. Most of all, the service is wonderful. There is a girl that works there who is super friendly and kind to children.

I have read many unfair reviews of this restaurant. It appears many people are attempting to "double dip". If you buy a groupon, don't be a cheapo and expect that the sushi half off will apply to you and then you can also get to apply your groupon. How do you expect these people to live?  Outside of the misers that are reviewing this restaurant everybody should know the following: 1) The sushi is amazing. I have seen some really innovative stuff. 2) The owners are amazing. They are super friendly and, if you have children, they are kind to your children. It is not every day that you find that in a sushi restaurant.  3) They will accommodate you. If you are a sushi fanatic like myself and like something that is not on the menu, ask and you shall receive. All of these reasons combine to make this my FAVORITE sushi place in Phoenix.

"You crazy kids turn that music down!" While I am not even close to the age of my Grandmother, I certainly felt like one Saturday night. The music was very loud and I could not hear anything that anyone at my table said. Also, I waited 20 minutes between each drink order. I do not mind waiting for food, which took almost an hour to arrive. Cause, guess what, I wasn't really there for the food. I do, however, take issue with having to wait for drinks. It is a Saturday night and I am ready to party. Not sit at a table saying, "What did you say?" and growing more and more impatient. I will not be returning.

I had Twisted Image do some work for my law firm. They did sunscreen for our firm retreat bags, water bottles and tote bags. Everything was perfect and received well in advance of my deadline. I will return for more stuff soon!

Went here on a Saturday night at 6. Don't ever make that mistake. Waited 20 minutes after we ordered our drink and left. The guy started taking other orders for people that arrived after us. We, the forgotten and thirsty, decided to give our patronage to another Thai restaurant.
