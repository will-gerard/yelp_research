A simple spot to enjoy good quality Thai food here in Central Phoenix.  True, the decor is kind of low key and the building kind of plain-jane...but the staff is always very friendly, sweet and attentive, and the food just plain delish.   My personal favorite is the Tom Ka Gai hot pot with Shrimp.  Great flavors and plenty big enough for two to share.  The patio is nice and usually less crowded than the inside of the restaurant.

If you don't mind your dental insurance and your own pocketbook paying for fancy furniture, spiral staircases and flat screen tv's over the dental chair then this is the place for you.    yeah, they are friendly enough, but i wasn't impressed with the work.  the crown they put on my tooth fell out within a year; my new dentist said they never should have crowned it as there wasn't enough stable tooth to put a crown onto...i should have had an implant.  i think they just wanted my money in their own pocket instead of in the periodontist's pocket.    Just not that impressed by the shiny "veneer" of this place (sorry, i couldn't resist).   find a dentist that knows their stuff and focuses on that instead of the foo-foo frills.

First off...locally owned and operated...that's worth a star right there.  This Harkins is in the style of all of the fancy newer ones and a few years after opening, it is still very, very clean and well kept.  I don't think I've ever had my kicks stick to a soda saturated floor in this theater!   The seats are large, high back, rocking, comfy with raising armrests which is so nice.  The staff is friendly, and on two occasions when I've foolishly left my sunglasses behind, they were waiting for me at customer service the next day......I'm not talking 15 minutes later, I'm talking a full day later!  Amazing!    They make their popcorn fresh ... you can see it popping out of the machines all day long, not like AMC with their big bags of pre-popped stale stuff.  The popcorn toppings are cool, too.  The outdoor kiosks to buy your tickets are great if there's a long line, but honestly, this place is always so well staffed that even when there's a crowd, there are plenty of kids working the booth and no real wait.  (Concessions can be another story.)   I always put the yearly tee shirt and large refill cup on my holiday wish list; even if santa doesn't come through, it's worth the $20 bucks or so to get free popcorn and $1 soda all through the new year.  And really, I'm not a soda pop freak, prefer club soda....and they don't even charge for that in the refill cup!   Wayyyyyyy better than any AMC I've been to in the valley (yes, this includes the huge megolopolis at desert ridge).   Go Harkins!  Go Christown!

A very nice resort spa with lots of the extras.  Valet parking and a bit of a walk to find the place but once you get there a very friendly and welcoming staff make it a nice experience.  The rooftop pool is especially nice (though small and it doesn't take many folks to make it feel crowded).    A nice feature is a large hot co-ed soaking tub, but again more than 2 or 3 people in it and it's hard to have a semi-private conversation.   The men's locker room is very nice with steam room, sauna, huge jacuzzi and a little space like a converted closet where you can relax and breathe in eucalyptus....oddly, I really enjoy that little hideaway a lot!    I've been here four times now and the massages ranged from okay to excellent.   But when I want a day-long getaway and lots of time to pool, hot tub, eat cookies and drink tea...Willow Stream is the place for me!  My mom likes it too.

Just had an Excellent dinner at Lupo.  There was a large group of us (20+) and we had such superb service...a very attentive staff who made it their mission to be sure every glass was full and every plate enjoyed.  Our table had a wonderful antipasti, calamari rings and caprese salad as appetizers and enjoyed every bite.  The pre-dinner breadsticks are traditional Italian-style...long, thin and crunchy as they should be...a half-dozen wrapped in a cloth napkin, perfect for breaking off and nibbling as we chatted over the appetizers.  I had the bucatoni with prosciutto and pecorino cheese; the waiter said the dish was on the spicy side and that the pasta was prepared al dente (as it should be); it was delightful.  A friend at the table avoids meat so asked for a simple pasta marinara which was served without hesitation; she loved the flavor of the sauce.  Another friend had the Lasagna-Gramma-style which was also very tasty ( i tried a bite)...delicious bolognese layered with cheeses and roasted green peppers instead of the pasta...she tries to avoid gluten, so this was an unexpected treat and quite delicious; I will definitely try to replicate this dish at home...wonderful!    After cosmos before dinner, 2 bottles of wine with dinner and lots of water, we passed on the cappucinos and tiramisu...but i would wager they were as wonderful as everything else we enjoyed.   I didn't even look at the prices as dinner was on one of our company partners....it was probably pricey...but worth it!

While waiting for my room at Mandalay Bay to be ready (a three hour rate, but that's another review...), I was starved for breakfast and found this place.  The menu board out front looked pretty good...and the clincher was "house-made corned beef hash".  I am a freak for corned beef when it's done well.  When it's on the menu as "house made", I get myself in line.  Eating on my own, I was jammed into a 2-top in between a couple of 4-tops against a wall.  At first not so bad, as the other tables were unoccupied, but within minutes I had 8 breakfast companions, all large and boisterous.  The waitress came by to take my drink order and was clearly miffed that I already knew what I wanted for breakfast and wanted to order it all at once.   Coffee appeared shortly, and then a plate with a pancake-high bit of hash...mushy potatoes, a little bit of corned beef, a side of one thin, thin slice of melon and a sprig of parsley (the menu says "served with melon and greens").  Do they think you won't notice???  When the waitress reappeared (after I had finished my measly meal), she poured me a half-cup of coffee...I guess it was time for me to go.  Not a fan of Vegas, and really not a fan of $20 breakfast that wouldn't satisfy Oliver Twist.  I won't be back...

Sooooo overrated.  I've been here three times now and this last time will be my last.  I don't mind a wait if the food and experience are worth it, but when you finally get seated at a teeny table with  not enough room for the plate, coffee cup and flatware and then the menu is limited to Denny's fare and just a hair above their quality....well, just go to Denny's.  I haven't been to Denny's in ten years; it will be longer than that before I go back to Matt's Big Breakfast.  Not a fan of greasy food.

Being fans of the Top Chef shows on Bravo, we were all (a party of 8) looking forward to dinner at Hubert Keller's Fleur.  Wow, what a huge disappointment.  The flavor of some of the dishes was "good", but not great; others were simply bland, ordinary and disappointing. Service was less than adequate; dirty dishes were never cleared away, even after 3 courses of small plates. In fact, when my final dish arrived, the waiter looked down at me as if to say "why aren't you moving that empty dirty plate out of the way so I can set this down and walk away"?  We ordered a few starters.  The marinated olives for $3 were the equivalent of what I can pick up at Safeway for a buck; nothing special at all, and I'm not sure sitting in a pool of plain olive oil really qualifies as "marinated".  For kicks, we also ordered the Parmesan Paprika Popcorn (also $3).  It was a tiny (yes, tiny) bowl of stale popcorn with powdered parm and paprika sprinkled on it. I'm not sure what why we expected anything else, but it was pretty much like low-quality AMC theater popcorn with Harkin's flavored sprinkles on top....at 10 times the price of movie theater popcorn.  The high point of the appetizers was the ceviche, but again....nothing better than you'd expect at any nice restaurant, and again very overpriced for the size of the portion.  For dinner, I had the Manchego Salad. Seriously, I make a better Manchego Salad at home...this was like spring greens mix from a bag with some grated Manchego on top; even the dressing was unexceptional.  My last plate was the meatballs, which were served in a hot pot with some broccoli rabe.  The flavor was nice, and the broccoli rabe steamed nicely...but 5 meatballs the size of ping-pong balls with 3oz. of broccoli rabe and a smattering of sauce that barely covered the bottom of the hot pot was not at all worth $14.   It should have been a $5 small plate.    Others at the table had the Fleur Burger...again tiny and ordinary, at $35.  Seriously, a $35 burger should be a knock your socks off burger.  Not at all. Slow roasted Alaskan Halibut was the quality of the buffet food we had in our conference earlier in the day.  And two of us had the risotto, which was probably a 2oz. portion.  I mean, teeny-tiny.  If any of this food had been presented on Top Chef, the cook would have been eliminated.  What a huge bummer for us all.  And a final check in the hundreds of dollars was such a waste of hard-earned cash.     Never again.

I like the Light Rail.  Just wish it went more places.  From my house I can walk 10 minutes to the nearest stop, and from there go to Harkins fancy new theater at Christown, do some shopping while I"m there. Or do a day off of Phoenix Art Museum, the Heard Museum, lunch at Fez, down to City Center.  Some days it's fun to go down to Mill Ave and wander.  Sadly, Snottsdale denied the light rail a home, so I have to drive to work (or take my bike on the rail and then ride my bike for another 20 minutes uphill)....I may as just well bike the whole way.    Great value, $5 for a day pass, ride it all you want.  Don't understand the crabby attitudes of some of these reviewers.  Drive your gas guzzler all you want and stay off the light rail if you hate it so much.

The 4 stars is for this particular Subway.  Most have subpar service and questionable hygeine, but I was famished on the drive home last night, debated on a flatbread at dunkin donuts but i have those too often....and saw this Subway so I pulled in for a grilled chicken sandwich.    I walked in to a full house, but both employees behind the counter gave big smiles and eye contact and acted like they not only cared about their jobs, but about making good sandwiches and being nice to their customers.  Big thumbs up for service!  These two won my heart over....I hope they stick around.

When I have the craving for pizza, which isn't that often, Z Pizza is the best spot in Central Phoenix.  Our guilty pleasure is ordering on Tuesday nights when it's buy one, get the second for $5 (or is it half-price?  some kind of great deal)....and eating pizza while we watch Biggest Loser.  I'm always a fan of pepperoni, and their crust is crispy thin...the best way.  Also like the Casablanca...artichoke hearts, mushrooms, ricotta, parmesan, mozzarella...so tasty.  Great to have Gluten-free crust as an option, and the ingredients are fresh.  Yes, it's a small west coast chain...but they do it "right".   Friendly staff, speedy service, easy location.

I love this Pei-Wei location.  I've been coming here since they opened about 4 years ago.  Great renovation of an old building makes for a great atmosphere.  Service is pretty good; especially the sisters who work the floor and have been there since Day 1...very sweet women and always take care of all your needs...leave 'em a buck or two, they work hard!     Yeah, parking is a pain if you eat right at high noon or between 5 and 7pm.  I often stop on my way home from the gym and pick up take away food; much easier.    Everything I have tried on the menu is just great. Really love their Thai Chicken and their Thai Coconut Curry ... my fave main dishes.  All 3 salads are great, and the Chopped Chicken Salad is actually way healthy when I'm watching my diet.  They just came out with some small plates; my man tried the chicken lemongrass salad small plate last night and it was really awesome.  They have a good test kitchen to come up with this stuff.    And I know it makes me sound like an idiot, but the really cool Coke dispensing machine is the bomb.  I usually just have the Lemonade Lite, but wow...6 flavors!   haha.   good stuff.

Best place to eat in the Central Corridor.  Great food, servers with lots of personality, a fabulous Sunday Brunch (with carafes of bloody marys or screwdrivers at $3, mimosa carafes for $6).  My honey and I had our first date here and have been back at least once a week ever since (going on 3 years now).   We love Switch!

Now that it's cooling down, I'll be heading back to Maizie's!   Summertime heat practically requires eating inside where it is just way too cramped and noisy (all those hard surfaces reflect every little sound).  But the patio is oh so lovely in the fall, winter and spring!   Love the Tuesday night pizza specials, the stuffed burgers, sweet potato fries, and every dessert I've tried has been superb (and even a bit too large!)   Service is always friendly and prompt, water glasses always refilled, happy hour specials are a great deal, large and tasty!    Like them on Facebook and get (seemingly) daily updates on specials!   Love Maizie's!

This is hands-down the best place for a massage or facial in the valley.  Every time I go here, I leave saying it was the best massage I've ever had.  There are always great deals on their webpage; last time I went was during Spa Week. I had the most amazing aromatherapy massage for $50; it was this crazy "pick a flower" thing but worked perfectly for what I was needing that day.  You can also use the hotel pool whenever you come here, which is off the hook on the weekends, but quiet and mellow through the week.  I usually come on Wednesdays when it's $75 for an hour of whatever you want and then spend a few hours in the pool and jacuzzis.  My sister-in-law had her bachelorette party in the spa a week before her wedding. There were like a dozen girls and they all raved about their day doing massages and mani-pedis and facials. They even did a bellydancing class and then had cheese plates and wine on the spa deck (compliments of the cool new brother-in-law, of course).  The staff treated them like family, which is one reason I really love this place.  No noses in the air, no snotty attitudes...just big smiles all the way around.  Check it out... a sweet little place!

Hands down, this place is in my top 3 spots to eat in Phoenix.  Maybe, make that top 2!   I eat here at least once a week and am happy every single time.  Chilaquiles are amazing...best I've ever had.  Huevos Rancheros are so tasty any time of the day.  And the little street tacos are just right on a hot summer night.  I've even tried a couple of the salads as a meal and been quite, quite satisfied.   The servers are all cute as pie (boys AND girls) and never leave you unattended.  I always leave satisfied and wishing I had more room in my tummy for more.   Okay, one small irritation is they never can seem to get a drink made correctly...I've had to send them back for what I actually ordered on several occasions...and they are all in the $8 range....a little pricey I think.  But really, 5 stars from me!!!

I love the design of this place and was really looking forward to trying it out.....had a fish burger and sweet potato fries that both arrived cold, a waiter who vanished constantly, but good drinks.  Felt sick for a few days after that.   Tried it again when a friend was passing through town who had heard good things.  Again, absentee server, cold/uncooked food, and again I felt sick for a few days.  Beautiful spot, but I cannot give it another chance.  :^(

Pita Jungle has really grown on me over the years and this location is a big reason why.  Service is always great and friendly whether it's eatin' in or for take-away.  The restaurant has a cool design and great views of the street in Roosevelt neighborhood.  Back patio is sweet and large.  I sometimes go on my own and sit on the patio side at the bar which is also nice.    Everything I've tried on the menu is good and tasty.  Lavosh pizzas are great, the Turkey Pesto Lavash Wrap is awesome, though I think it's pretty chintzy to charge for extra dressing (really, is it like made of gold???).  Many good options for vegans and vegetarians too; the Lentil Fattoush Salad is a particularly good stand out.    A great place to go for a healthy and affordable meal.  Enjoy!

2 stars. don't get me wrong, i LOVE dunkin donuts...and i never even buy the donuts!   coffee is better than starbucks and way more affordable.  i have the egg white/turkey sausage flatbread sandwich for breakfast on my way to work several times a week.    but boy, the service is so poor at this location.  as another reviewer said, it doesn't speed things up (ever) to go inside when there's a long line at the window....just go for the window as the inside counter is always understaffed.  at least once every 2 weeks, my order is screwed up....and i order the same thing every day i go here.    lately, i've just given up and gone to the store at 40th and thomas; way better service and friendlier folks.

a nice little place. glad when it finally opened as the remodel seemed to take forever.  the interior is fresh and clean but not very stylish; we usually go through the drive-through.  It's not terribly speedy like you expect at drive-through windows, but that's a good thing...they make the food fresh to order!   everything i've tried was tasty and plentiful.  seems a little on the pricey side, but again...it's FRESH food so overall worth it.  i'll keep cruising through every few weeks.  Supporting local business is important, and it's way cleaner and better than all of the Fili-o's places.

We just got home from a great evening on the patio at Timo Wine Bar.  Totally enjoyable, nearly magical, atmostphere....large canopied mesquite trees, comfortable seating, and a big fire pit to center it all.  We breezed through the indoors just to check it out and it was very classy and well designed; the embossed leather wallpaper is gorgeous!  From the time we approached the hostess stand until the time we ran out the door through a surprising burst of rain, the service was friendly, prompt, and stellar.  Even the slices of bread served with our goat cheese were replenished as they started to get low...a rare bit of service that helped to take it over the top!  We shared a plate of 3 bruschetta (tomato and creamy brie, salmon with creme fraiche and preserved lemon, and a pesto/basil/tomoato concoction) and also the creamy goat cheese and olives.  The breads are all baked on-site in a wood oven...very delicious all the way around!  We had some pinot grigio and chardonnay...both top drawer!  our friend introduced us to the most amazing Spanish beer...Estrella Damm Inedit.  I swear I will go back here just for this beer....absolutely the best beer I've ever tasted in my life!  (And I've been around the block and to numerous breweries to boot!)   If you come by this great new joint in town, definitely put the Estrella Damm on your list....and get the large bottle...$14 but it will fill your glass nearly three times!   They even serve the bottle in a chiller to keep it perfectly chilled.  Five stars for Timo!   We Shall Return!
