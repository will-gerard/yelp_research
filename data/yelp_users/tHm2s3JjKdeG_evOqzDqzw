Love this wine bar! Great music and wine selection! Always a fun experience :) I started with a glass of prosecco and the hubs had an old world blend from Umbria called Antonelli  We had the cheese plate which was good, triple cream Brie and mustard grain cheddar. So delicious! We ended wanting an espresso martini which they didn't have but substituted a chocolate one.  Pretty tasty but not quite what I was looking for.

Though the food was decent, not amazing, the service was poor enough to not ever be back. I felt bad for the servers, there was 2 of them and they seemed overwhelmed. There was no sign of a manager or even a busser or greeter, so I think they just had way too much on their plate to give good service or even to smile. Like many of the other reviews the best thing about this place is the salsa bar, however most of the "good" salsas were empty and never refilled during our visit.
