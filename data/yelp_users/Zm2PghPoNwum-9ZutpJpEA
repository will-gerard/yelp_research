I have been here several times. From car wash to windshield repair. They have always been good to me and my van,  so today I decided to get my oil changed to. I was really impressed. They brought my filters out to show me they needed to be replaced. Didn't sell me anything I didn't need. I will defiantly be back

It's a 50 year old dive bar. I have to say for being that old it's pretty clean. If your looking for somewhere downtown to have a drink go check it out. I thought it was closed when we 1st got there so don't be fooled. The bartenders been there 30 years. You can shoot pool for free.

Ginger not bad... Service a little lack luster but food was perfecto! Menu didn't make you head spin to make a choice.

Last night we ate at this pei Wei. We got there kinda late and when we went to order they were out of the sushi rolls that we wanted. We went ahead and ordered what they had and a meal.  The manager brought part of our food out and apologized again for being out of what we had ordered as well. Asked us what else we would like on the house. The food was excellent as always and the management was more then accommodating. We will defiantly be going back

A group of us went there for lunch yesterday Service was slow. Half of our party had to leave because it took so long. We watched other tables be served that came in after us. When we tried to say something to the owner her response was "try doing what I do" I WOULD NOT recommend this place. The food here is comparable to Taco Bell. I'm being generous by giving one star

I recommend National Property inspections to all of my clients. They are friendly, professional and fast. I love that they do a free reinspect! Most companies charge $100.00 to come back out. The reports are easy to read. My clients and I have been very happy.

We started off ordering our meal and requested no masago we received our appetizer that was overcooked like crunchy chewing gum.  It was suppose to be calamari. We were watching our waitress when she picked up Our order pointing at the rolls the chef said its fine and shewed her away. When she brought it to our table she told us that there was masago in two of the rolls and she said the chef said " there's only a little bit" needless to say we will not be going there anymore.

Burgers are amazing! Try the chile cheese fries as a meal or on the side. They have the  best custard ever,  I like vanilla the best. I don't think I've ever eaten anything there I didn't like
