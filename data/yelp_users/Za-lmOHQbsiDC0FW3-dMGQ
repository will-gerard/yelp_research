One  for the short wait on a Saturday. I've been here on a Sunday and previously waited so long we sat at the bar and ended up walking out and over to joes after 15 minutes. Another  for our waiters excellent attitude and a third  for the excellent food. We never recieved appetizer plates for our appetizers or bread, they may not give those out for bread. There was a stack of coasters on the edge of our table about 12 or more the whole time. No one else had extra coasters on thier tables and we were seated next to the kitchen. Slight wait for the asparagus. I will say I'm not a fan of our waiter sitting on the bench directly across us to take our order. My husband and I usually sit on the same side of the table. We will be back, looking forward to a better all around experience. Steaks were delicious.

The wait was not long to get a table,  our server Morgan was great, friendly and attentive. The food was amazing. We always get the steam pots, we tried the bucket of shrimp, which was great. A few new menu items, next time we will be more adventurous and try something new. My go to is always the Rajun Cajun, and have never been disappointed. The staff is all great and interactive. The GM Steve has always stopped by our table to check on our experience. I go to both locations, but this one is my favorite. It is always a very welcoming experience.

The menu here hold alot of different options. i have never had one bad thing here. The food is superb. Service is always excellent no matter how packed it is. Just a word of warning, it's a Viking's bar. So be prepared during football season. It is within walking distance of my home, so that's definitely a plus. Lunch,  dinner, late night or even sunday brunch there's never a bad time to go. They also offer growlers and to-go packs if you'd like. I reccomend the peach ale, and oatmeal stout. Also the growlers are re-fillable so you can bring them back.

Delicious, drinks and dining are always impeccable. Never have had a bad experience. This is a once a month Sunday dinner with the girls event. The margaritas are delicious. The corn bread in the pan adds a little country to the dining experience. The service has always been on point. Drinks refilled before anyone passes by and I have to ask, the cadence of appetizers, entrees and desserts is always great. Never have to rush to finish my salad or finagle plates around on the table.

Best service ever. I am a fan of the afternoons. Friends, pool, and long islands. I've actually played pool all day here with Too$hort. He was very proper. Bartenders are all awesome especially Andrew, and Joe.

WORST SERVICE AND EXPERIENCE EVER!!!  Initially quoted $800. A week later call and spoke with Duane on the phone, told him I would be in an hour with my diagnositc test from Purcell's ( been going for years, but thought I'd be saving $) Walk-in, greeted by David, told him I had already been helped by someone who's name started with D. Knew it wasn't David. David said he's the "ONLY one who works there, who's name starts with D." Okay fine. It ends up being 1500. Which I didn't have. A week later, I come in again, greeted by Duane!! I told him what happened the week prior, and as he's helping me David overhears and interrupts and says that my ticket is his ticket and he has everything ready. I told him, yes but I also told you I was working with Duane first. If you can tell a little lie, you can tell a big lie. Just help him with what he needs. Also David takes it upon hisself to belitte Duane in front of me, saying that he orders the wrong parts. At this point already I want to go somewhere else but am commited to staying there becuase I was already there. Customer Service Manager asks what the problem is. I assure her everythings fine, I have the right person working with me. Total 1400. I also tell him my battery is dead. Thinking they will address this as well. A 1 day job turned into 3 days, so they were supposed to credit me 65.00 in addition to the 10% customer service fee. 3 days later I call @ 11am. My car is ready. They didn't even call me. I ask for the total on the phone, the manager said he had to assess my bill. I come in, they say $1599.00. I asked about my discounts, OH yeah! 1439.00, but at this point, instead of the 65 deduction they only did a 35 deduction. I just want my car and pay it. They hang me my key. Don't even tell me where my car is. I find the car. Get in, it doesn't start. They never replaced my battery. I find a mechanic, he jumps it. I end up going to another garage for the battery. AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL. FIRST and LAST time EVER going there! DO NOT RECCOMEND IT AT ALL!!!

Dinner here on September 02, 20124, reservations for 8:30 pm. My husband had the bone-in rib eye with bone marrow, and I had the prime aged new york strip, we shared the duck confit salad, also had the croquettes and a caramel souffle. The steaks were amazingly robust and cooked to perfection, each bite succulent.  The view, ambiance and amazing server created one of my best dining experience. Our server knew the menu well, even as to the number of days our steaks were wet/dry aged. This was my second time here, the first was for a friend's birthday. This restaurant holds incredible memories for me and I look forward to celebrating here for the coming years. Definitely reccomend.

Only 2 stars, because the food was amazing. Just terrible service. Starting off on the wrong foot. Our server literally threw the coaster at my father. He was so irrate and ready to throw it right back at her, we had to calm him down. I told her, you can get away with throwing coasters possibly to the younger people at the table, but my father doesn't like that, and I asked her not to do it again. I still tipped her well. I will go again, but I know my parents never will. Next time I am also going to speak with the manager.

I absolutely love this place. The staff has always been friendly, fast, and efficient. Why wait for Tuesday for double stamp day, sometimes they hook you up on a regular day. Try thier gourmet granola bars from Seattle. Those are devine. The menu is limited, but it makes up for it in delicousness. Albeit, there are really no places to chill and sit, but why waste hours when you can be out doing something

My husband and myself are steak lovers. We are also foodies and love to frequent different places. We came on August 17, to celebrate my birthday and his new promotion of GM certification with a different chain. It was a last minute choice so we came with no reservation later on in the evening after 8 p.m. I ordered  crab legs and he had lobster I believe. Our waitress was very informal, we both sat on the same side of the booth and she took our order with her knee on the other booth. She did that the few times she did come to our table. We passed on appetizers and had salads, the food was exceptional just the service very mediocre. We were almost done with dinner and I still had a piece of crab meet literally almost to my mouth and she asked if she could take my plate. Obviously I wasn't finished. We didn't order dessert. I felt it was a rushed experience. I called a few days later and spoke with the GM, I forgot his name. He did apologize and stated that each dinner was expected to be a 2 hour experience and we shouldn't have felt rushed. He did find our ticket time and agreed that it did seem fast. I just wanted to let him know of the very casual service and rushed time, and he offered to send something to us. We have not received anything and that was almost a month ago, I figured it would be a free appetizer or a percentage off our next visit. We won't be coming back. Overall great food, bad service.

Very bad customer service. Needed to tape an envelope, the other post office on Southern will tape for free and are very courteous. The older lady I had was very insistent they don't tape here. After explaining I had very little money and these documents were very important to mail she was just very unhelpful. Plus the package I mailed was used  but I always reuse packages as long as you black out previous mail bar codes it generally is fine. She just questioned everything and made the whole ordeal very difficult. I left upset without my mail delivered, went to the grocery store for free tape. Will go to other post office tomorrow.

Okay. I grew up in Autozone. My dad before college was a mechanic, so any repairs he generally does hisself. Unfortunately he lives 300+ miles away. For the last 3 months I 've had to repeatedly replace my driver's side headlight bulb. Each time I have gone to Autozone, this one twice and another one once. This one actually is a little bit farther than the one by my house in Tempe. Every single time, my bulb has been $8-$10. Each time also the salesman will give me a list of prices and ask me which I would like. This time no options and it was over $13. Ricardo was helping me, he started out pleasant and then kind of had an attitude. When we went outside he said I can't replace your bulb because we have new policies and I can't remove anything from your car. "Let me speak to my manager" The manager who had for the last 15 minutes, was in the parking lot just talking to some guy, and wasn't even wearing a Autozone shirt or had a name tag. Additionally when he (manager) approached me, he did not even introduce hisself. He basically said the same thing, yes we can't help you. Even after I pointed out that I've had this same bulb replaced by Autozone including this store previously with no problems. He just walked away at this point. No apology at the least. Frusturated i just returned the bulb because I knew I could get it cheaper at the Autozone by my house. On my way out to my car, I expressed my discontentment to a customer in the parking lot. He offered to replace the bulb for me. I went back inside and bought another bulb. Lo' and behold this one was only $9.99. A $2 difference but at least I had the option, when I pointed it out to the new salesman ( I forget his name) he just apologized (finally!) and said maybe they were busy but he just came back from his break.Thanks to a good samaritan, I had my bulb replaced. Very poor customer satisfaction on both the part of the salesman and especially on the manager's part. I will not be going back to this specific store. Like I said I grew up in Autozone, but I am going to become a Napa customer. I definitely do not recommend this location to anyone. Especially since it was such a simple thing, and now you've just lost a loyal customer.

Awesome staff. Very helpful. Allowed me to leave personal items @ main office. I rented a kyak and a paddle board. Instructors were very thorough and attentive. I had alot of fun, and definitely heading back very soon.  Snack bar items were a bit pricey, but that is to be expected. There is no dress code, but make sure to wear clothes that you expect to get wet in!

We went on a Sunday, my cousin and an old classmate of mine. After sitting for 30 minutes finally a 'new' server comes and gives us coasters, takes our orders. I order food from Cheba Hut to be delivered. That would be about 45 minutes which is fine. 15 minutes later, same waitress comes back again to take our order. We told her she already took our order. So she leaves at this point it's been an hour. So we just got up and left, Which is a shame because they have such a vast variety to sample. Oh and the menu they gave us was days old, so when we did order we had to make 3 choices each because they were out of what we wanted. Their menu generally changes daily. We went to Mill Cue Club and I got my food re-routed. I agree with Taric. "World of Clusterf---"

I came here at the persuassion of my coworker, she got a Groupon. I LOVED it, we did our research before hand, and it was great to support a local business. The 'Flying Pig' Sandwhich was superb. The apple smoked bacon was just the right thickness, and complimented the thinly sliced turkey breast. Roasted tomatoes contrasted well with the herb spread. All on a toasted slice of bread. It was such a great treat to have such a finely crafted, delicious sandwhich. I represent 4 hotel properties in the area, and definitely will be putting this on our Preferred Catering, and Restaurant List. Thank you for the great dining experience!
