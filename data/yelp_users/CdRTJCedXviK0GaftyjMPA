My family drives over from Maricopa to eat here. We love it, it's our favorite Mexican food.

I think the day shift crew is comprised of a bunch of trainees. Cold food and warm drinks took 15 minutes.

When a business opens at 11am I expect food to be ready to order. I've been to this place several times just as they open and they have literally NOTHING ready. Why on earth wouldn't the rude staff start cooking 30 minutes prior to opening the door? I watched 8 people walk out before I decided to leave as we'll. The staff never so much as said "hello" to any one of the 15 people waiting for food to be cooked. VERY RUDE AND VERY BAD BUISINESS.

Whoa!!!! I watched a customer bring a pizza back because it wasn't made to her specifications. No problem, it happens. The next customer through the door ordered a pizza and was given the exact pizza sitting on the counter. The same pizza that was just brought back in. Totally unacceptable!

It's been almost 20 years since I lived in Michigan and have been craving a Hani. The food at Detroit Coney Grill is outstanding. It hit he spot and took me back to Hockeytown!

The staff is friendly enough but the eye doctor is not very warm or talkative. It's  almost rude the way she handles her patience. Frames are pretty expensive too. Overall not a pleasant experience.
