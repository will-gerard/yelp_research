Horrible bar service... All Draft Beers are out on a SATURDAY! Not worth the stop.

I have heard so many positive things about this place and it has always been ok our list of places to try. We tried Casanova Bros. for the first time on Monday and we are back on Saturday. Mike and Tony make you feel valued and take care of you. We went all out our first time and tried appetizers, salads, pizza, sandwiches and desserts, everything was excellent. We are happy to have a great pizza place so close to our home. Thanks Mike and Tony, we love your place!

Great shop!  I have had my hair cut by Timmy, Brendyn and Austin. I can't say that I have had a bad experience. These guys know what they are doing, they listen, and they care about their customer service.   As long as these guys are there I refuse to go to any other barbershop.

This shop has moved and they have increased their prices twice in the last 6 months. I love the barbers but the shop has changed so much. I can't say that I will continue frequenting this place if they keep raising their prices.

The Nile Theater is the only REAL venue to experience music at. Been going there since I was 13 years old, I wouldn't change a thing!

Great shop! The barbers are the best in Arizona, in my opinion. A quiet and cozy shop that gives you more of a classic barber shop feel. This shop is getting more and more revamped all the time. I can't wait to see how it will progress over time. Good music, good beverages, great barbers!
