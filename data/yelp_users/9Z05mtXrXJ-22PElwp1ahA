I've hesitated to write about Fate. I always enjoyed the food and experience at the owner's old Lucky Dragon, even back when it was on University. I also appreciate the fact that Fate is a downtown pioneer, and that one can eat there after 9:00.  We've been to Fate a number of times, with vaguely disappointing results. After this visit -- we've had it.   I'm not really high on the "this happened when i went there one time so it must happen all the time" style of user review. So, let me state that everything that happened on this visit has also happened during previous visits, yet never all at once. Fate, however, put it all together this time to deliver a really memorable fiasco.   I don't know if Fate's policy is to have the hostess/host inform everyone waiting for a table that the wait is going to be fifteen minutes, but the math doesn't work out. The place is tiny. We waited forty minutes. The next group waited fifty-five minutes. The next few groups are probably still waiting, their once-vital bodies deteriorating into skeletons.  The server dropped off some menus, mentioned that she was going to bring us some water, and then vanished as if she were an illusionist's assistant. Again, Fate is tiny, so the trick was pretty difficult.  Anyway, we ordered after she rematerialized (after the required fifteen minutes). Stuff arrived. It was the old joke -- "the food here is terrible... and such small portions!"  I'll spare most of the hideous details, but one lowlight to share involved the sesame/shrimp/salad item. I'm hoping that the foul flavor and aroma was the result of some slightly-off fish sauce, rather than some slightly-off shrimp. Actually, why do I care? We felt lousy afterwards and dosed up on the twin antidotes of water and mouthwash. Our cat still wouldn't come near us.   Anyway, I don't mean to imply that the owner and staff at Fate are malicious. The food isn't good enough, and the experience isn't good enough. Oh, if you're uncomfortable with IKEA furnishings (I'm fine), don't even try it.

Excellent way to ease the exquisite pain of waiting for a table next door at Pizzeria Bianco. Nice wine selection and great snacks to tease your appetite.     Chuck is a top-notch wine guru, and Vishaka enchants with her poetic description of the cheese plate.

Love it. Hole-in-the-wall with Peking duck on demand. Try the greens and the snapper sauteed with ginger and scallions. Great noodles, too.

If this were a one-time-only event, I wouldn't review it. There have been two such events this summer, and there's a rumor of a third. So, keep an eye on the New Times' Chow Bella blog. If there's another one, GO!  On 8/8, Nobuo Fukuda (formerly of See Saw), his charming wife Sarah, and a few others (with a high tolerance for heat) commandeered the Welcome Diner and put on quite a show. The a la carte menu included:  - Shishito peppers with olive oil and soy sauce - Watermelon and goat cheese with sun-gold tomato, olive oil, and fresh mint - Panko fried soft shell crab sandwich with green papaya slaw - Pork belly with steamed buns - Marinated short rib with steamed buns - Okonomiyaki (a Japanese pancake, in this instance with pork, octopus, squid & topped with pickled ginger, aonori, shaved bonito, dried shrimp, Japanese mayo, and tonkatsu sauce) - Kakigori (Japanese shaved ice: melon, green tea, coffee, or strawberry)  The evening was a lot of fun, and the menu for any further events is TBD. Highlights included the soft shell crab sandwich (ridiculous) and pork belly steamed buns (amazing). The okonomiyaki was delicious, but beware: it can put a dent in one's appetite and curtail pork belly consumption.   Tips: If you get a seat inside, it's going to be about as hot as it is outside. So, wear shorts and sit outside. Also, it's BYOB. There seems to be an issue with alcohol on the patio, so walk into the building to sip (or be really low-profile).

If you're looking for Mexican seafood, I'd say MPH gets the nod over other joints such as Acapulco Bay (S. Scottsdale), San Carlos Bay (CenPho), or San Diego Bay (Guadeloupe).  The place has a bit of a rep for crab enchiladas (there was a blurb in Gourmet a few years ago), but they may be one of the more bland things on the menu.   I'm going to second the idea that the shrimp dishes are a great way to fall for this place on the first visit. The camarones culichi are awesome, with a tomatillo sauce that should be distilled into bath salts. Snapper veracruz is delicious if you're looking to test one of the more typical preparations.   Oh -- This place isn't really that parking-sketchy (especially if you've experienced the Ranch Market demo derby up the street) and they have their own lot right in front.

This is a smaller, older, happier Aj's. A go-to spot for produce if you can't get to the CenPho downtown market or the Guadeloupe Farmer's Market. Very helpful and unpretentious service for wine and liquor. Good for pizza-by-the-slice (I like the veggie).  Hot tip: Flowers are half-off from 4:00 to 6:00 on Friday. They have some really cool single-stems, so you could do something snazzy on the cheap.  Fun fact: Chris Bianco used to make pizzas here in the late '80s, when the store was called Euromarket. Talk about nostalgia -- you could grab a Bianco pizza and eat outside with only a ten minute wait!

Maestro Chris Bianco whips up addictive sandwiches at his laboratory on Central Avenue. Ingredients are local and super-fantastic. Check out what today's market sandwich is -- if it's oven-roasted pork, buy it immediately. Don't miss the rice pudding.

I have a few CenPho-based graphic designers as friends. They swear by Impact, and I can understand why.  After the design for my business cards was ready to go, Impact treated my (let's face it -- SMALL) order as if it was as important to them as it was to me. I appreciated the attention to detail, and I now have an education in just how many different white card stocks there are, how many different shades of black ink there are, and how the two elements complement each other.   Seriously, as my business expands I hope to use Impact more and more.

Great sausage-maker in central Phoenix. Try a few of these instead of what you get at Trader Joe's (which are also good) and you'll never go back. You can get anything here from from andouille to chicken cranberry. The staff are helpful, welcoming, and thorough.

Another place I've been visiting for years and forgot to review. Everyone else has said a ton about the food. The pastries are, indeed, great. I can indulge my weakness for almond croissant. Nice option for a peaceful lunch.   OK -- here's why I really love this place. A few years ago, the owner put up some paintings by a friend of his from Lyon. There was an about-the-artist sign on the wall. All it said was "He paint just during the night."   Minus one star for the Malthusian disaster that is the Esplanade parking garage.

The center of a mini-empire at 40th St. and Campbell. Good place to relax over breakfast or lunch. Try the Spanish latte. Service in the grocery is uneven (watch out for some prodigious yawning from behind the counter). Great wine selection and lots of fun things to try, though.    LGO Pizzeria next door is swell; nice to have in the neighborhood!

For migraine sufferers: I can't recommend Dr. Hetrick and staff highly enough. They are thorough, creative, and effective.  I've had completely debilitating cluster headaches since I was 17. After years of useless consultations with headache specialists in New York and L.A., Foothills Neurology put together a treatment program to contain the problem. I've been going strong for nearly 10 years.  I hope nobody needs this review, but this a great professional practice and an asset to the Valley.

Great when lovely owner Justina is there, but when she's not -- beware.  Normally, food is explosively flavorful and service is warm and attentive. Went recently on an owner-free Saturday. Employees tried to close early, poured us the last of our BYO (about 25 minutes after we'd arrived and wolfed our food), then screamed at us to leave.   I don't know if this is biz-as-usual, but it's not worth another trip to find out.

Lali J. and I took a road trip to Tokyo Lobby last night. We'd heard about it through excellent reviews in the New Times and the Republic (a positive review in the Republic is often a neon sign that says "stay away," but we decided to risk it).   As a transplanted New Yorker/San Franciscan/Los Angeleno, I have to say Tokyo Lobby has been my favorite sushi experience in the valley. If you're used to Ra or any of the other McSushi places, it's worth the schlep up to North Glendale (which is almost as far as the Yukon from where we live) to check this place out.  T.L. is a small, 10 table joint, but it's crowded in a vibrant, fun way. Service is fast and friendly. It's in a strip mall, but if you keep your eyes left of center as you approach from the parking lot, you won't see the WalMart on your right.   The usual/traditional suspects are brilliant -- stunning unagi, maguro, tobiko, etc. The sides and appetizers were fab, too: great seaweed salad and gyoza.   Tokyo Lobby is creative with the specialty rolls -- the Marilyn Mon-Roll (not kidding) was terrific: a spicy tuna roll wrapped in albacore with an elegant topping of crispy/crunchy onion.  There's also a full menu of earthbound flesh and assorted other goodies. Everything looked great. Really -- check this place out!

I've been eating at Pepe's for years. The taco siberia and taco monterey are definite high points. The egg/breakfast stuff is also surprisingly good. I don't drink much anymore, but I'd head straight here if I had a hangover.   P.S. If any of you remember doing a slow burn when Pepe's was cash-only, those days are long gone.

Copenhagen runs a full-blown outlet next to their warehouse. If you want to go Danish modern / contemporary and save some cash, check it out.   The space is big. There's usually a good mix of couches, bookcases, and rugs. The inventory is floor samples or returns. Condition ranges from needs-some-TLC to pristine. In my experience, sofas tend to be in the best shape.   A few things:  - I'm 99% sure it's closed on Sunday. - I've never seen any of the accessories or higher-end office furniture that they have in the Camelback showroom. - Copenhagen has a minimum delivery charge ($100, I believe). Buy multiple items or bribe a pickup-owning friend with lunch at Pepe's Taco Villa. - It might be hard to find in the Grand Avenue labyrinth of doom. Direct yourself to a point just southwest of the 43rd Ave. Home Depot, and you're in.

A total place warp to New Jersey or Long Island. The family couldn't be nicer. Terrific sandwiches (fresh mozzarella, tomato, basil and lots of others), a nice selection of unusual-for-this-area groceries, and it's even fun to sit around outside at the strip mall and eat during the afternoon.

The huge menu looks fantastic (crab, sea bass) but I've only been for dim sum. Selection is decent and it's really good for Phoenix -- try the steamed pork buns, har gow, and the bean curd wrap/dumpling things.   Weekdays are easier to handle than weekends. One dim sum Saturday featured huge crowds and an odd scarcity of dumplings and other steamed items.

This place is inside the 99 Ranch Market at the Chinese Cultural Center.  When you walk in, make a right and keep going. Make sure you don't go to the "combo plate" steam table area -- Taiwan Express is in the corner.   You order at the counter and wait about five minutes. The chicken pancake is a psychoactive delight. Also try the whole fish (a special once or twice a week for five bucks!) and the boba teas.

This place is super-stylish. Cheerful, modern space. Perfect for talking or working (there's wi-fi).  Really good coffee (but I'm not a fanatic). Food is well-crafted from excellent ingredients -- they're small plates, so don't expect to get stuffed. Great addition to Central Phoenix.!

I love the place, and I love Lisa G. First, some of the menu choces rock: the antipasto plate makes indecision a virtue, the vegetarian lasagne is a great special, and the shrimp tacos on Tuesday night are a treat.  The space is cool and sophisticated, and Ms. Lisa G. is a friendly and dedicated presence in Central Phoenix.

Today's lunchtime quest was to check out Baiz Market. The place is like a mirage. It sits on a barren residential stretch of 20th St. near the intersection of the I-10 and the 51. Don't worry about the car; there's abundant parking and little potential for destruction and mayhem.  This is actually a business-within-a-business. The restaurant inside Baiz Market is called Al-Hana, and it's a clean, well-oiled machine. Al-Hana takes up about an eighth of the market's floor space. A young woman was taking orders at the counter and two white-uniformed cooks were models of efficiency. You can see everything being prepared as the aromas of garlic, sumac, and roasting meat fill the air.  I had a small order of hummus and a chicken shawarma sandwich. The hummus was enough for four small people or two large people, and it came with a mountain of freshly house-baked pita triangles. It was delicious, but next time I think I'll ask for a slice of lemon on the side. The chicken shawarma sandwich was a miracle of industrial design. It was a perfectly shaped torpedo: juicy chicken, pickles, onion, and garlic sauce wrapped in a perfectly heated piece of flatbread. Make no mistake -- this thing is easy to eat but it's also impervious to collapse. It's the perfect thing to eat in the car (not that I eat in the car), and at $3.99 it's a bargain. For non-carnivores, the menu has grape leaves, taboulleh, falafel, baba, the famous thyme pie, etc. Did I mention the garlic sauce?  After lunch, I strolled the aisles of the market. Picture the market side of places like Haji Baba or Middle Eastern Bakery and Deli, but about 10 times the floor space. Spices, bagged pitas and chapatis, green and roasted coffee beans, a full produce section... it's like being in a supermarket from a more interesting place .  Definitely check out the glass cases in the back, where the meat guys reign. There are halal meats available and the staff is friendly. Personally, I locked in on the case to the left of the meat counter. Olives. An armada of olives, floating in fragrant oil. Next to the olives, red pepper paste (the ultimate condiment) beckoned. I wanted it all.  Head to Baiz Market / Al-Hana for some fertile crescent-y goodness. One tip: as other Yelpers have mentioned, there's a $10.00 minimum for debit and credit cards.

Wow. This tiny slice of gelato heaven is next to La Grande Orange. I don't even much of a sweet tooth and I'm thinking about it at 3:00 AM.  The place is run by an Italian couple who obviously know their stuff -- the gelato is magical.  The pistachio is amazing. Peanut butter -- amazing. Anything with chocolate -- amazing. Fresh fruit gelato? Amazing. Lunge for any daily-special flavors. Try it all. Keep going back. Arlecchino is relentless.

I went for the gelato, and I was impressed with the imaginative flavors (red velvet cake...). I had pistachio, and my friend L.C. had cookies and cream. We also sampled butterscotch chip and a few sorbets. Everything was delicious.  We didn't have any coffee, but I will definitely try it next time I'm in the neighborhood. The barista / gelato schlepper (his description) seemed to be on his game and the coffee aroma was tempting.  The other reviews mentioned the chain pizza / rumpus room / rehab center picnic area decor. Yes, it's all true. With the power supplies (for laptops) above table level, the place also looks like the ship in The Matrix.  BTW, the gelato end of the business is called Monster Gelato. Monster must be the name of a cat, as one scoop is called a "kitty" (or maybe "kitten") and the larger portions are identified as cat sizes. The place is eccentric -- but definitely independent!

Matt (of Matt's Big Breakfast) has opened this swanky-but-comfy bar/restaurant/tavern/ downtown. The building is a beautifully resurrected vintage house -- perfect!  Cool place to hang out and relax. Grab a seat (if you can) in your room of choice. There's a giant communal table in the back and an amazingly wallpapered (you'll see) chamber up front.   Terrific craft brews and a nice wine list. Haven't tried the food yet, but the menu features a comforting, upscale twist on the normal bar fare.   Great reason to hit the downtown stretch on nights other than First Friday.

I rate Dozo 5 stars at dinner (when I wanted a relaxed meal) and 3.5 stars at lunch (when I needed efficiency and ordered lunch specials). Order a la carte at dinner an let 'em do what they do best.  OK, the usual nigiri suspects were fine. if they have the escolar sashimi special, snap it up. The hot rocks are a decadent appetizer. I think they're made of mushrooms, crab, and something else (if I'm wrong, just eat them -- rich and delicious). Oysters -- fresh and terrific.  Here's the thing: the service has been wonderful. One night I was with a birthday party of six. We were running late, the restaurant was 20 minutes to close when we got there, and it was practically empty. The owner pulled me aside to assure me that we shouldn't feel rushed and to enjoy ourselves at our own pace. The meal was outstanding and my friend had a great experience. Anecdotal evidence? Sure, but we were touched.   They also did a great job with the interior -- anyone remember when this was a Chinese fast food joint? Playing Miles Davis and Thelonious Monk doesn't hurt, either.

Iain is right -- Wahsun has some very creative business hours. I shop at the Sprouts in the same shopping center, so I'd only been shut out when trying to grab a menu. No big deal, but kind of mysterious. I thought I might never get to try the place.   I was starving after watching the inauguration, so I figured I'd combine a grocery trip with a Wahsun lunch special. Fortunately, Wahsun kept the doors open last Tuesday.   I still want to order off the regular menu, but the lunch special was like a practical joke (in a good way). All lunch specials are $4.95. Usual suspects -- Broccoli beef, shrimp w/ lobster sauce, etc. All served with the standard egg flower soup, crab puffs, and white rice.  Here's the thing --  there was a lot of food. A hell of a lot. It didn't come on one plate. It came on three, plus the soup. A full platter of broccoli beef, a vat of rice, and five or six crab puffs. It was hot, fresh, well-seasoned, and cheap. Those are the four food groups, right?  The regular menu features stuff like flounder with yellow chives, roast duck, and clams with black bean sauce. I can't wait to come back with a crowd for dinner, but I'll call ahead to see if they're open.

Checked out D'Lish with Gabi and crew. Really cool space with super-efficient drive-thru and friendly staff.  I sampled the "Breakfast Buzz," which is a delicious smoothie made with espresso, Nestle good morning mix, banana, chocolate, and peanut butter. The owner claims the Breakfast Buzz has restorative properties for those suffering from hangovers.  The coffee was also excellent. I'm 99% sure D'lish sources its beans from Echo Espresso on the west side.   Bonus: you can buy 160 ounces of coffee (in a disposable insulated box) for 20 bucks. That might be enough to get your group through a PowerPoint presentation or two.

*Review for dim sum only  Phoenix Palace is part buffet, part a la carte dim sum, and part take-out Chinese BBQ . It's huge! The space could easily contain the Hindenburg, with a few smaller airships tucked away in reserve.   I had dim sum here with a Hong Kong native, but I didn't need her vast experience and knowledge to reach a decision: not very good.  You know what? This review is boring. Please pretend this list is a word cloud and draw your own conclusions: --congealed --lukewarm --imitation krab --sticky paper --bland --forgettable --dry --chewy --empty --easy listening tunes, including "Feelings"

1/25/2009 -- Wrong, wrong, wrong! I have eaten here four or five times since then. Helen Y. says Phoenix Palace acquired a master dim sum chef -- who now brings a relentless attack of treats every weekend.  Love the pan-fry cart with chive dumplings and rice noodles. Also, I don't have much of a sweet tooth, but the snow mountain buns are fantastic, custard-filled delights.  I think they might not be good for you.   If you have a few hours to kill late on a Sunday morning, I can't imagine anything better than eating dim sum at PHX Palace with friends and family.

I tried to hit this place with Julie P. on opening day, but traffic was backed up from the entrance all the way to 29th Ave, along Indian School Rd. We retreated to another supermercado, our dreams of tacking a whack at the opening day piñata completely dashed.  Fortunately, Helen Y. and i were combing the area before going to Tim Finnegans, so we checked it out. The layout is almost identical to the Ranch Market on 16th st. and Roosevelt, with the same amazing produce and aguas frescas. The seafood bar isn't as snazzy, and I'm not sure they have grab 'n'  go containers of salsa -- you can buy it by the pound at the salsa bar, which would take an extra 30 seconds or so.   What's cool about this location (besides being a ten minute drive from the Melrose District), is that the Costco Business Center shares the parking lot, and they sell dirt-cheap restaurant supplies. A trip to both places could outfit a barren fridge and kitchen for about 18 bucks. Since I plan to cook five nights a week until things turn around, 33rd Ave. and Indian School is recession-busting headquarters.

Haus has snazzy new digs on Central Ave. near Highland. It's much more spacious than the old site at the Biltmore Fashion Park.  Still a cool locally-owned spot for modern furniture, gifts, books, etc. Sure, some of the stuff gets knocked off by Target or IKEA. You still aren't going to find real Saarinen tables or Moroso chairs in too many places around town.   Kudos to Gregory and his staff for keeping it going all these years, and through all the ever-improving locations.

I can't recommend this company highly enough. Eco-Fresh is based in Scottsdale. They specialize in green carpet, area rug, and upholstery cleaning throughout the valley.  I moved into an older condo in February. The previous owner had been here 20 years, owned pets, and was pretty lax about cleaning.The day before I moved, I had Eco-Fresh in to take care of the carpet as well as my area rug and sofa.   Eco-Fresh uses Green Seal Certified products, and there's nothing but a "clean" smell after they've finished.The techs were punctual, competent, and friendly. The charges were exactly as estimated, and the results were fantastic. I had them back yesterday to clean the sofa (it's vintage, the upholstery is unique, and my cat lives on it). The service was again impeccable, and the results again perfect.  Philip, June, and staff will answer all questions about alternative cleaning methods and are very responsive about scheduling.  If you're interested in greening your home, or if you have rugs and furniture that need gentleness, this company is a great choice!

Creeping senility: I thought I'd reviewed this place in 2005. The public area is probably about 600 square feet, but every inch is jammed with Fertile Crescent / Mediterranean goodness.  This is a bakery, restaurant, and grocery. The restaurant part of the operation has a an extensive menu of flesh-based and vegetarian options. There are plates, salads, and sandwiches. The plates (kebabs, gyros, etc,.) usually come with a decadent rice pilaf, your choice of tabbouleh or Greek salad, and tsatsiki. There are a few grilled chicken dishes, and the chicken is always moist with a nice char.  MEB&D also bottles its own spices. Not as diverse as Penzey's, but it's nice to have an option on 16th St. Hat tip to Adam M. on the olives -- they're delicious.  Dessert? They serve different forms of baklava, turkish coffee, and homemade halvah (they'll slice off a piece with a scimitar-looking blade for a sample -- impress your friends!).  Tips: - You can buy Greek tobacco soap. - The soup of the day is always avgolemono. It always will be until the mountains crumble and our love is through. Sometimes there's an excellent red lentil as a second option.  - They have great par-cooked or reheatable stuff  -- it's in the frozen section. - MEB&D is an effective and affordable option to cater a party on short notice (I've done this).  IMO the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. The components are all four-star, but the place gets the fifth for the "park-once, enjoy-many" experience.

I agree with Helen Y.'s take on China Chan. Food is really good, decor is pretty grim.  Ordering cooked-to-order dim sum off of a menu is a real treat. Sure, there's a festive aspect to watching carts roll around and anticipating what's going to be revealed, but that can be tricky. If a place doesn't do a lot of volume, items can sit too long to be really enjoyable. Furthermore, there's the crushing disappointment of seeing something that looks incredible come by after one is already stuffed and helpless.  At China Chan, it's more of a sushi menu process. You look at pictures (if needed) and check off what you want on a printed menu. Small plates start to arrive in about five minutes.   CC did a nice job with all the standards we ordered: shrimp har gow, siu mai. beef ball, BBQ pork bun, Chinese broccoli, rice noodles... all great. The only misstep was a plate of roast duck that was only so-so, but I had sworn to stick with dumplings and such -- it was mild punishment.  Bonus: China Chan opens at 9:30 on Saturday and Sunday. Dim sum breakfast anyone?

Dish is.... closed!  I was about to whip up a written tour of this gigantic and ambitious space, but it's too late.  Looks like Dish had a severe case of bad timing: http://www.azcentral.com/ent/dining/articles/2008/07/14/20080714dishclosing.html   Too bad, after the enormous investment and effort!

I haven't been swept up in the Great Cupcake Bubble of 2007-2009, but these are absolutely delicious. The olive oil carrot cupcake with mascarpone icing is one of my favorite treats in town.   Owners are very accomodating, bake everything in small batches on site, and "use organic whenever possible."  The menu features cookies (mojito cookies!), cakes, tarts, and some well-crafted lunch items from Tuesday to Friday.   The Sweet Pea brain trust decorates the airy space with local art, and the bakery is located next door to the Royal Coffee Bar -- the corner of Jackson St. and 2nd Ave. is the perfect spot to get caffeinated  and indulge in a sweet thing.   Tip: Bring some change; you might have to park at a meter.

aka Green is an eco-building dream. It's also a fun and accessible place to browse.   They have all kinds of goodies here: Yolo and other low-VOC paints, kirei board (google it, you have to see the pictures), marmoleum and other cool flooring, compact CFL bulbs, and a boatload of cleaning and stripping products. If you've ever used Jasco to strip something and wandered around in a daze for two weeks, this is the place for you.   The owners and staff know what they're doing and are extremely helpful. Green products often require shifts in perspective and technique. I've always found the people here to be honest about the positives and challenges in working with materials (like pressed sorghum boards) that weren't readily available until a few years ago.   Tip: aka green is heavily involved in community events. Check the calendar at akagreen.com .   Four stars for innovative products, 1/2 star for above-and-beyond dialogue, and 1/2 star for thoughtful activism.

Unfortunate, but this business is closing down its showroom. Their email newsletter says: "We realize this may come as a surprise to many but, due to a variety of reasons [including the obvious economic elephant], we have decided to close the retail operations of a.k.a. Green in mid-December. "  Inventory is being liquidated at 15% to 55% off, and they have some cool stuff. Check it out if you need anything.

Phoenix royalty is in the 'slope! These guys, without question, are los reyes. They are not screwing around by making such a claim.   People love the huaraches, which are gigantic corm tortillas covered with white cheese, red or green salsa, and mushrooms (hongos) or various meaty choices. I've had the huarache with mushrooms and the version with carne asada. I've also had the mouth-watering shrimp burrito. All are delicious, but...  The tortas are where it's at. I mean, they strike some kind of poetic balance that resists duplication. The sandwiches have a variety of toppings and fillings, and are served on a beautiful bolillo roll. I'm partial to the milanesa (breaded chicken or beef). There's something about the mild crunch of the filling that combines with the smoothness of the avocado and the kick of the jalapeno. Fantastic.  Los reyes also deliver on the beverage front. The make their own fresh juice, so there are quite a few options for aguas frescas, licuados, etc. One thing worth trying is the vampiro: orange, carrot, celery, beet, and pineapple juices. The vampiro will probably cure the most intractable ailment.  The restaurant is also bustling and fun. Servers are friendly and multi-lingual. If you live in Sunnyslope, check the place out immediately. If not, it's worth a trip!

Strange. I had two great experiences here. I think we were in the mood -- everybody wanted snacks and drinks rather than a full sit-down extravaganza. The burrata was delicious, as were the butternut squash ravioli and the fries. Drinks were interesting, although I'm not into the whole absinthe thing.   The place is a really nice option for late night or small plates and drinks or whatever. I agree that it might not have a niche or a true identity yet.

Visited the new space in the former See Saw location, and I really enjoyed it. Chris L. and I stopped in last Wednesday. We were both fans of Digestif in its first incarnation, and i was excited to check out the more intimate space.  Payton & Shantal do a great job after such a quick transition. I'm a huge fan of the farm-to-table philosophy and the frequently changing menus. It's a happy place, especially if you sit at the counter and enjoy the show.   We sampled a bunch of stuff -- watermelon/crab salad, gouda/truffle mac & cheese, confit fried chicken, blue cheese coleslaw (killer), and Shantal had whipped up a fantastic banana cream pie. OK -- "we" didn't really "sample" anything. That's what I ate. Everything was delicious.  It's nice to see someone who cooks with belief and passion, as Chef Curry does. If you're up for a new experience, check it out!

The ice cream was overly sweet, gummy, and lacked anything but a passing resemblance to its alleged flavor. There was, however, a lot of it. No joke. Order the kid size unless you want an ice cream blob the size of the Hindenburg.

Yes, I'd met Sweet Republic's Helen and Jan before I ever set foot in the shop. And Helen and Jan are splendid people. Bias be damned -- the product at SR is brilliant, unique to the valley, and somehow both familiar and avant-garde.   I paid my first visit (pilgrimage?) tonight with Kelly B. and her superspy husband. Among us, we sampled everything in the case -- flavors remarkable (cheese course duo ice cream -- roquefort and dates), bracing (basil lime sorbet), and flat-out unfair (mayan chocolate ice cream).   I wound up having a sundae for probably the first time in 20 years: mayan chocolate and bananas foster ice cream, fresh blueberries, salted caramel, and homemade whipped cream on top. Kelly's husband had watermelon sorbet. Then he went back for cantaloupe sorbet. I have no idea what Kelly ordered, as I was so absorbed by what I was eating that I entered a fugue state.  Everything is made in-house, and Helen has some serious culinary chops. For those who want comfort flavors, SR whips up mint chip, rocky road, belgian chocolate, and other goodies that won't invite cognitive dissonance.   What really impressed me was the attention to design in the shop. The place is really sharp, and they went with quite a few eco-friendly choices from aka green and other vendors. Check out the tables topped with kirei board, the recycled glass tiles behind the counter, and the bamboo wall decorations.   It's all smashing. ¡Viva Sweet Republic!

Excellent vintage shop in the Melrose district. Hollywood Regency is in the space that used to house Phoenix Metro Retro.   There's great vintage wear for men and women, all kinds of furniture, household bling, and other magical items from WWII through the 1970s. HR is a nice place to do some targeted or impulsive shopping while listening to Duke Ellington or other appropriately seductive music.   Heidi, the owner, is extremely nice and very selective. She also participates in the Melrose Third Thursday and First Friday extended-hour extravaganzas.   Tip: Check out Lamar, the cat. He's the light-heavyweight champ of 7th Ave.

From a cat owner's perspective: I first visited after the last killer-pet-food scare. Noble Beast is a great alternative to the Petco/PetSmart axis of giantism. As I live solo, I tend to indulge my little co-pilot. Noble Beast is the go-to place for kitty swank.   NB carries all kinds of natural and organic cat food. They have great toys from Smart Cat and other vendors, and all kinds of fabulous stuff for clean-up (green tea cat wipes, anyone?) and transport. If you haven't seen the sleepypod cat bed/carrier, check it out. It's a splendid design. Of course, to get my cat to sleep in a $200 bed, I would have to also buy a $400 bed for her to ignore.  The people at Noble Beast are super-knowledgeable, empathetic, and helpful. It can be a bit disorienting to see all these non-mainstream products, so ask questions. You'll get a thoughtful answer every time.

If you're lucky enough to live in a neighborhood with a new Fresh & Easy, you've probably been privileged to find some really wild propaganda hanging from your doorknob -- "Fresh & Easy Facts."  Something along the lines of:  -----------"What is Fresh and Easy... and why should you care? Fresh and Easy is a new store owned by the Wal-Mart of Britain, and they are targeting you."_______  I'm not sure what these helpful people think F&E is "targeting" us for. Depending on the week and the mood, it's either union-busting, food poisoning, or enslavement by army of robots.   Here in the Melrose District, there's a new piece on the door every seven days. Usually it's a two-sided glossy with the intro, "a message from your local butcher." As if we all stroll reguarly to our neighborhood butcher, fishmonger, greengrocer, and notions shop.   A quick trip to www.freshandeasyfacts.com reveals that this campaign is supported by "grocery workers, food industry professionals, and the United Food and Commercial Workers." Online strategy by Blackrock Associates, an online marketing group for individual politicians and PACs.  I say, I like having F&E around here! It beats hitting the Fry's of Broken Dreams on Camelback.   Some highlights: -- Hansen's sodas, including non-diet ginger ale and pomegranate -- Locally packed gelato from Berto's, under the F&E label. (hat tip to super-sleuths David S.B. and Julia T. on this) -- Flowers with plenty of life marked down 50% -- Lots of other stuff marked down 50% -- Nice steaks, including rib-eye and filet -- Better than having the originally-planned Osco where Chez Nous used to be  So, go to the Indian School F&E. Embrace Tesco, the Wal-Mart of Britain. Then hit the Downtown Public Market for some locavore action.

Gelato hits the Central corridor. Just north of Highland, underneath Landmark Towers. This is like V-J day for some of us CenPho dwellers.   Sweet Venezia opened yesterday. The space is modern and clean, with wi-fi and a few flat screen TVs.  I went with a friend this evening and we sampled, well... everything. Lemoncello sorbet, profiterole, mascarpone caramel pistachio (that's one flavor) -- everything tasted great and had just the right level of moderate sweetness.   Sweet Venezia also has espresso drinks and assortment of pastries. We met one of the owners, Luisa, and she's quite nice. She says that the business will be open from 11AM to 10PM every day.    Welcome to the neighborhood!

Smeeks is the latest addition to the anti-mall at Camelback & Central that houses Frances, Stinkweeds, Red Hot Robot, and Halo. I love it -- candy fits perfectly among the other businesses now obscured by the Dutch Bros. on the corner. Unfortunately, I've become addicted to Old Faithful bars ("Named after the famous geyser in Yellowstone National Park. Just as reliable!") at $1.50 a pop.   The place is just freakin' adorable, right down to the charming typeface on the sign. They sell all kinds of goodies -- old-school soda, semi-forgotten confections, cool and vaguely dangerous toys, etc. It's retro/ironic or nostalgic/sincere fun, depending on your inclination. Check it out and grab some goodies!

Groovy place for vintage glass, ceramics, clothing, and furniture. Beth and Josie both have a great eye. R.R. is smack in the middle of the 7th Ave. mini-boom. Check it out!

Not sure how to follow Julie P.'s epic review, but I thought I'd show some support.  La Condesa is a fantastic addition to Central Phoenix. Casual, nice people, amazing food.  Like other reviewers, I'm partial to the Oaxaca black mole chicken and the cochinita pibil. Everything is delicious in any delivery system -- taco, burro, or (gooey and vaguely depraved) quesa.  The salsa bar really gets me, though. Experiencing it is to suffer total cognitive arrest and disorganization; it's like love at first sight or stumbling upon a work of great art. Peanut, cilantro, de arbol... bring a sharpie so you can mark the little plastic cups and remember your favorites.  Bonus points: The server remembered that I'd asked for strawberry salsa (they were out) on my last visit eight days prior, and offered a totally above-and-beyond apology. Must be something in the mole that sharpens the memory.   Great place -- a gem.
