After my horrible experience at Last Chance I was hoping this place would be better, and it was!! Everything was on sale, and they have sooooo much stuff! My dad got like 5 nice dress shirts, I got a pair of sleep shorts and a dress and I think my mom got something and it all totaled to about $70! Such good deals! If you have a daughter who needs a prom/homecoming dress or if you need a formal dress for yourself this is the place. They had a lot of pretty dresses for super cheap. We were pretty much shopped out so we didnt spend that much time there but if you have 3-4 hours, spend it here! and it lets out into the metro center mall so when your done in there you can stroll around out there! I am definitely going back soon!

i do love me some mini golf, even though i am not that good. lol. but hey its all for fun right??!! it was pretty crowded for a saturday but then again its getting warmer so i didnt expect any less from it. prices aren't too bad. and there are 2 different courses to choose from i believe. it seemed even more crowded because of the water park, so if you dont like screaming children running around then stay away! the course we chose was a little slow but it got moving once everyone got their games going. usually when i play i dont keep score because im not that competitive, but my boyfriend kept score and that only made me want to kick his butt, but that didnt happen because i get in this mindset of how im gonna totally win and yeah. lol. but i cant wait to go back again. this place is definitely good for parties too. they have a pretty good size arcade inside as well as a food place to get like hot dogs, hamburgers, pizza, etc. the water park also looked fun and since i hear it gets to be like 120 degrees here in the summer time that definitely sounds like a good plan.

Dear God I will never go back to this place : ( I only gave it 2 stars because some of the deals on clothes were really great! But overall this place was a disaster. Maybe it was because we went on a Saturday but it was so crowded and the lines were so long. I was excited when I heard about it because I am always looking for a deal on designer handbags. All of the handbags were shoved into probably 5 big table bins, and as I was "digging" though them I came across a $65 Juicy Couture purse that had stains on the outside and rips in the inside. WTF!!! This place is pretty much a garage sale. My dad told me he saw a pair of shoes that looked like it had barf on the bottom of them. gross. And some of the women who shop there.....Snobby Bitches. lol. This one lady gave me a dirty look as I was looking at the JC purse. Don't worry lady this one is all yours! So if you are willing to deal with long lines, rude shoppers, and crappy merchandise than have fun! Otherwise don't waste your time

the first time i went here was back in january when queen creek was having that week of crazy weather. went there for dinner with my boyfriend and his mom and the place was kinda crowded but we got seated really fast. the mariachi guy was walking around which was very interesting. for some reason it must have been an off night because our food was ok, and the credit card machine was down so all credit/debit transactions had to be ran through by hand.  however...i was just there last sunday again with my boyfriend, his mom, and some more of his family and it wasn't that packed yet we prob waited like 45 mins, which i guess isn't too bad, but we were all very hungry. our waitress only came to check on us a few times. the food server guy and the chip guy came to check on us more than she did. but....the food this time was much better!! except for the fact that my boyfriends brother was getting pissed off because he wanted steak and they didnt have steak, then he wanted chicken enchiladas and they were out of the shredded chicken so he wasnt too happy. but the rest of us were! and my boyfriend and i got margaritas and they were good too! definitely will be back for sure!

came here on a tuesday i believe for lunch. when we walked in we were the only people in the place, and it was like noon or 1. ordered a pitcher of beer[blue moon] and a small pizza[chicken supreme] and it was only like 15 bux i believe, it was perfect for the both of us, and got us pretty tipsy ; ) hehe. pizza was really good and so was the crust and i am picky about crust. lol

maybe we went on a night when it was just really super crowded, but this place was crazy. even parking was a mess, and there is a ton of parking. i felt like i had left arizona and had been transported to texas. and like i had walked into a big huge family reunion. lol. there were 8 of us total in our group. 6 adults and 2 kids. we found a table but the line to get food was ridiculous. also everyone around us didnt have food either. instead they had alcohol, which is what i was definitely gonna need if we had stayed. we stayed maybe like 10 mins then left to go to Serranos because it was too crazy. sorry san tan flats

completely forgot about this place until just now! came here about 4 months ago. my boyfriend was running in the Rock and Roll marathon so his mom and i decided to eat breakfast here. now when we got here it was prob like 6am?? since we had to drop him off for the race, so there was really no one in the restaurant. they had a lot of ppl on staff which was good-even tho it wasnt that crowded. but prob once the breakfast rush started to come in. we both ordered the protein pancakes. now it comes with 2 but our waitress told us we could just get one since they are really big and have a lot of good stuff in them! we also ordered fruit on the side. now when she said "big" i was thinking like Ihop or Denny's size, but they really are BIG!! like huge. prob the size of a large dinner plate. it was really good tho, and very filling! i would def come back again to try their other food!!

i literally can walk to this place from my house. but my boyfriend and i drove. after a night of lots of drinking we were craving good breakfast food. and being very hungover this place definitely hit the spot! lol. we went on a sunday at like 10-11am and we were the only ppl there for a while then ppl started to show up. but the food was good, and the waitress was nice and prob knew that we were really hungover. lol

went here yesterday with my boyfriend. we had been craving sushi and luckily this place is so close to our house so we were hoping it would be good! and it was! my boyfriend got a crab roll and a spicy tuna roll and i got a veggie roll and a cucumber roll. the place was pretty empty when we got there and didnt really get busy the whole time we were there. the place is really nice. not huge but not super tiny either. and our food came pretty fast! the only draw back is we are from california so our sushi places also do 50% off all prices, and this one does not. but i know we will def be back for sure!

I love that I can walk to this place! Everyone should eat here!!

went here on easter. the atmosphere is cute. pictures of dogs are plastered everywhere, and they have peanuts on the table in a dog bowl. i had been sick for a while with a horrible sore throat that eating anything was nearly impossible so i ordered a salad. it was good, but i will have to go back to re-enjoy it! lol

i do love me some fro-yo. went there tonight with my boyfriend and his mom and it was packed. ive never waited in line to get yogurt before! lol. the flavor choices were ok. i stuck with the euro tart and tart pomegranate. lots of topping choices though. my only complaint was that it was pretty much all melted by the time we got home, and it was like 60 degrees outside. but other than that it was good and i will def be back esp since its only 39 cents and ounce!!

came here to play disco golf. its a really beautiful park. it has a nice area for the kids, and an archery range. the disc golf course was a lot of fun! it has men and womens tees which are nice for someone like me who isn't that good. lol. the one thing i didnt really like about it was that it looks like a huge course, which it kinda is, but the way they have it layed out makes if feel like its all cramped in there and sometimes there are discs flying all over the place so you have to constantly watch out that you're not gonna get hit. but despite that i like the park. im guessing its fairly new, and when we drove up there were some parts still under construction. hope to def go back soon!
