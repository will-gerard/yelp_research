While my food was great,  I definately didnt enjoy the service.  We waited and waited and waited 45 mins for our food & drinks.  I felt like our waitress forgot we were there.  However she was super attentive when it was time for us to pay...

I can't stand banking here. I can't believe they aren't open til 6pm on Mon- Thurs like other banks!  Get irritated every time I'm here, no customer service, constant mistakes, don't take responsibility for their actions that cause problems, refuse to refund fees that are their fault.  Just don't bank here.

Everyone goes, bartenders are all friendly and customers are nice!  Love the martini's too, my personal favorite it the Lychee martini.... one of the few places in town who serves them!

If you're from NYC (like me), and you're looking for a good slice, then you should try Ray's.  I've been to a couple of Ray's around PHX, and they are consistently good... at least as good as you're gonna get if you're looking for a pizzeria style slice- not fancy schmancy or thin crust or some other non NYC authentic corner pizza.  Perfect cheese to sauce ratio for my taste.  And good bbq wings.  I recommend ordering a pie on your way home from work, and get it to go to enjoy at home.

Thank goodness they opened a location near me. I could probably eat the same dish there for the rest of my life... or I guess I could try other dishes too. But if it ain't broke, why fix it?

You haven't had a martini til you've tried one at SideBar. Fresh squeezed juices and the perfect blend of ingredients makes this my favorite place in town for a yummy drink. My favorite? For now it's the 'Lectric Lemonade". I take small sips to savor every bit ;)

I don't do caffeine anymore, or calories for that matter... so this is my fave place to eat yummy & healthy guilt free food!  They can make pretty much any tea you can think of- I used to love chai(but I'm off caffeine, remember?) so now I always get the vanilla rooibus tea  with soy milk & a little splenda of course.  And I love their roasted chicken salad for lunch.  Something about the way they make it- I wonder what the secret ingredient is!  Best part- when you get a salad or sandwich, you can add on a large tea of coffee for just $1.  What more can you ask for?

My shop is right down the block from Bitzee's and we had to work late a few days last week.  Good thing, cuz I had the chance to try Bitzee's nachos.  They were so awesome, I ended up eating there 3 days in a row & shared the chicken nachos with my hunny each time.  The nachos were smothered in...everything!  Chicken was very flavorful and moist, and the portions were so huge that even though I shared (and I'm not a big fan of sharing) we were both stuffed!  I'll be back for sure :)

I love this place!  It's the kind of place that will make you want to redecorate your entire life.  From local hand made jewelry to purses, wall decor, baby things, and things you never knew you wanted but really really need and can't leave without!  Perfect example- there was a cool collection of yard sticks in different colors... don't need one but had to have it!!

Best hidden secret on the valley!  Nostalgia, sweet treats, fun flavors & a perfect garden to host kids parties.  Extra points cuz they're pet friendly :)

Painfully long lines in the early afternoon on a regular weekday...all for a large container of glitter.

Every now and then I obsess over certain things- food, shoes, clothing, songs, etc...  and now I'm totally obsessed with the cheese fries at the NEW Zing's!  I don't usually like real cheese on my fries, but the wonderful lady chef thoughtfully perfected the cheese by melting real cheddar into their awesome mac n cheese sauce.  So it's very flavorful and actually quite dangerously good.  And did I mention they're just $3? Love, love, love!

Such an awesome antique and vintage shop!  I found a vintage- super cool, super narrow and long metallic blue vinyl clutch here.  Perfect for wearing with any outfit.  They've also got vintage toys, jewelry, dresses, antiques and more.  I got to talking with the owner, Bonnie, who tells me the shop is kinda haunted, people have claimed they've seen ghosts in her shop.  I'm not into ghost hunting but if you are, maybe you'll see one when you visit!
