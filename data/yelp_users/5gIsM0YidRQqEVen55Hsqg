Staff is always friendly !   Food is always fresh and hot!   I am a fast food junkie waiting for my metabolism to catch up to me.  I have had everything from their chicken strips to the burgers and it is always cooked fresh !

This place is awesome .  Although the place looks older the food is great and the employees are friendly. The lunch specials run around $5.00 and that was with a soda! I will post some pictures during my next visit.  If your looking for some good Chinese and are in the area stop in.

Took my truck here because my office moved to Chandler. I had a weekly pass for another wash by my old office.  I wash my truck on the weekends and take it to a wash during the week. After one wash the tire shine was all over the side of my truck. It looked worse then when it was a little dusty. Went back the next day and the manager said it's because they use a cheap oil based shine that doesn't stick good to the tires. They offerd to wash it again for the exterior only but through their fast pass lane. The guy drying the car half dried it and left spots all over it. I wasn't about to go back again and complain after I just did so avoid this place. I'll take my business back to classic car spa.

Worst sonic ever.  Full of idiots. Every time I go here I get the same "sorry for the wait" and they mess up my order every visit.

Awesome guacamole and the tacos are great! We live in AZ and stopped in for dinner when staying at the boulders. I recommend it!

Been coming here for years. The only place I will go to get a hand wash. Avoid the other places that ruin your car running them through a wash that scratches your car. They are always busy so expect a wait to wash your car. Then again if they are taking their time you will get a good wash. Check them out on living social or Groupon for great deals. Classic does good work.

Had the pulled pork. As always, it was great! Go try this place if you want some good BBQ.

I have had BBQ from all over the country. This place has some good southern BBQ right here in PHX.  The meat is always moist and smoked good.   Make sure you try the brisket and the pulled pork!   Oh and the ICE Tea mixed half with sweet and half with regular is awesome !

Best pizza in town.  The owner is always friendly and remembers your name.  Even if you haven't been there in 3 months he will still remember you or try to even after1,000 people have come in.  The wait is a little long for pizza some times but who cares when the food is so good! We will always be loyal to this place and support the local business it has grown into. Get the knots and a pepperoni pizza!

Lunch special was great.  Pretty hard to mess up soup and salad.  Then again I have had a soup and salad that wasn't that good.

Adam has tinted a dozen of my cars throughout the years.  I will not go to anyone else for tint. His work is flawless and I have never had a problem.  Plus he is mobile and will come to you!

Wife was sick and wanted some soup. We had the cheese and broccoli and it was great. A lot cheaper than Paradise and just as good.

This place is great ! They moved from the Power RD location to Valvista & main. Don't let this fool you, the quality of bikes and customer service is way better than any other shop. My wife wore out her cruiser from Walmart and decided in a good quality bike. Needless to say we both walked out with new bikes and my wife got a sweet basket and line that doubles as a purse ! Don't waste your money on a $100 bike at Walmart when you can get a bike intended to ride smooth and comfortable! The owner Brian is great too! Thanks guys!

Man...This place is a block from my office and I never knew it. I got the Detroit Coney combo. Loose ground beef,  chili, dog, mustard and onions. It was so good. And the fries were amazing.  For $7.77 (after yelp discount) it was a great deal.

Great sandwich shop ! I had the buffalo sandwich and it was great! The kids love to write down what they want on their sandwich. They also offer crust free bread for the kids!  It's a little pricey compared to the other sandwich shops but the meat is a lot better here!!!!

Had the bacon cheeseburger ! If you like the chargrilled taste like myself then you will love their burgers . Everything was fresh and the burger was filling . The fries reminded me of what corleons has but they have a hint of spicy. Regardless this place is great. 4 stars dues to the price...

Steven is a great person.  Very professional and always on time. I used him on a few occasions and every experience was great! I recommend him to a stranger at the airport in Fargo,  ND and when we arrived in PHX he was waiting at the gate for us.  Amazing guy!
