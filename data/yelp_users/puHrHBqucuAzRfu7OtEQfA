I love this place stopped in the other night on my way home, the experience is always good, but Mike always puts it over the top, always friendly, remembers what you drink, takes care of you.  I think is a different vibe when he isn't there, still a good experience, but not as much fun.  He is a huge asset.   The food is too notch and you can't beat the quality or price.   Just a great experience.

Stopped in again, greeted warmly and went over to the bar, because Mike was there!!  The food was great the service beyond reproach, and as always Mike took care of business.  He is one of the reasons I go there, though the other employees when he is there seem to step their game up as well.

Stopped in when on this side of town, greeted and went over to the bar,The food was great the service beyond reproach, and as always Mike took care of business.  They are truly fortunate to have him, other business could learn customer service from him

I've been going for the past 2 years.  The food quality is great, the workers seem to love their jobs, and are quick and efficient.   Recommend them highly.

I had finally decided on what I wanted for a tattoo.  Having watched Heather in action working on some friends I knew she was the one for me.   I contacted her, sent her my idea  and when I showed up for the appointment I had options to choose from.  Didn't take to long about an hour and a half.  I received nothing but compliments on it.  6mths later went back for another and 6 months after that had my lower leg wrapped.   I have gotten nothing but compliments on her work and friends have gone and taken their friends.  I can't recommend heather or the shop enough.

I usually go the one in Tempe, but was in the area and looked forward to stopping in here.  That is where it ended.  Took 5 minutes for the hostess to help, with 3 employees and possibly the manager behind the bar laughing.  Get in line behind new people, the guy behind the counter explained how it worked gave them their bowls and walked to the others end where his friend was and started talking to him.  People were starting to come in behind me, and the new people were going to let me go first but it is a little difficult when you aren't given service.  The guy must have heard them because he glanced down.  When he didn't head back I decided to leave.  Walked past the hostess who said nothing and the manager and bartenders were still laughing.   If you want good service and friendly people who will talk to you go to Tempe (and it is farther for me than this one) it is worth the drive.  I will not return here nor will I recommend this one to my friends.

I revisited this location and my experience was so much better.  Greeted right away, received service at counter and was asked if needed help etc.   service is so much better  I highly recommend this location now.  I will go back for sure!   Now I have two to choose from, depending on what part of the valley I am in

Will not go again.  Used to be one of my favorite places downtown to eat.  They had messed an order up before, (gave me one pizza that wasn't mine, but I also didn't check until I go to my location)  this time I ordered on line at 1130, paid, said I would pick up about 1200.  Recived my receipt, got there at 1205, was finally acknowledged, and they couldn't find it, was told well it didn't come through.  I just said I wanted my money back, the manager came over found the order in they system, so obviously it came over, and said it would be credited to my accout in 2 days, we shall see.  No apology given, nothing.. poor customer service, if they had been busy like usual, I might be more understanding, but they were not.

Terrible customer service  ordered food  was told about 11 minutes.  Was told they would see where my order was yet never was called out for it.  35 min later I went up to tell them I just wanted my money back. It had been sitting there for who knows how long.  The wings are ok but will stick with other choices from now on
