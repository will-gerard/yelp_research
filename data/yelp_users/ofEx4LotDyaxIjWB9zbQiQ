This location sucks. Didn't know you could desecrate chipotles perfection but you can. They run out of super basic things every time I'm there and just expect you to deal with it not even try to provide more or hustle. Last time I came in at a very normal dinner hour and they ran out of steak and the employee said to just order something else? Da fuq?   They run out of chips ON THE REG which I didn't know was possible. There will be 6 or more employees standing around doing nothing. Also the employees are pretty sassy 85 percent of the time (eye rolls etc). Like I get it, customer service is rough at times but chill out.

This place is like the ultimate guilty pleasure. But ice can't be Thaaaaat bad for you right?  Usually super quick drive thru or walk in even when crowded during the summertime.

This place is not good. I paid over 15 bucks and got a really pathetic wash. The inside job was laughable. Understand I didn't get a full detail job but there was still visible dust on the dashboard. Seems like they just took a dirty rag and quickly wiped down.  The main thing that really rubbed me the wrong way was that when I handed the attendant the tip he counted it in front of me. That's like a server counting a tip while standing at your table. Rude.

Oh my lord. This is it. The end all be all of Phoenix pizza. I loved everything we ordered and had no problems devouring it.  We started with the calamari which was perfectly cripy and had the perfect amount of salt and bright lemon.   The funghi pizza with red sauce was to die for. The ultra thing crust is dangerously easy to chow down on. The white pizza with truffle oil was great too, but I'm personally not into truffle anything.   The ambiance is adorable and unique - a converted house to give a very homey and warm feeling. This is definitely on the short list of perfect date spots.

I go here more for the ambiance and less for the actual food. The food isn't bad, but also not amazing. The French dip meat is not thin enough and doesn't make sense for it to be on a pretzel bun.   Last time I was there I got the mac n cheese which was bomb, but the $2 add on of chorizo was a joke. There was barely any in there.   The drinks are good and the vibe is awesome. Always receive good service, too.

Oh where to begin? The service was honestly the worst I have ever had the displeasure of experiencing in Phoenix. Took forever to get our first drinks. Not once was I offered to have my empty water cup refilled and finally it was filled up after asking 3 times. My burger was good, but the fries came out feeling like half frozen Oreda's. However, the waiter took so long to come back after dumping off our food that I had finished my burger by the time I could even tell him about the fries. When I finally told him he very awkwardly said, "ugh, I could get you some new ones, I guess?" Another server brought out the side of fries later and tried auctioning off to the table next to us (don't tickets have table numbers labeled?) which was kind of awkward, too. Essentially my friend and I ended up splitting some new (piping hot) fries after we were done with our entrees. When the runner dropped the fries I also said we were done with our entrees and she said she would send a busser to clear our plates. Well, about 30 minutes after staring at our empty, dirty dishes they were finally cleared.   My friend made the mistake of attempting to order a second beer which took over 15 minutes to receive. Once again, we heard someone try to deliver it to the table next to us and then the runner just left with the beer. Our original waiter came rushing out with the beer a few minutes later. We were there over two hours because everything moved so slowly. It's a shame because the ambiance is so nice and the area is convenient, but there's no way I would go back.

Having a Korean mom and experiencing her cooking my whole life, I'm always pretty skeptical going to any korean restaurant. I was pleasantly surprised by the food here.   Since it is Phoenix summer I opted out of the hot stone dishes and went for Galbi and spicy squid. The squid had lots of zucchini and other veggies mixed in, which we really enjoyed.   The Galbi was really well marinated I just wish it had some char that comes with grilling at home or a restaurant with table grills. But, it was still really delicious. The sides were good too.  My one complaint is it was severely understaffed and the owner and 2 servers were super overwhelmed. We weren't greeted for about 15 minutes while awkwardly waiting by the door. I won't hold it against them though.  All in all friendly staff and good food.

They always do a stellar job and are extremely affordable. They have every gel color including Essie and OPI. I usually go to Tracy and Tina...both do an awesome job!   Only potential downside is that during the school year walking in can be a long wait, so always call ahead to avoid a wait. Lots of pedicure chairs, so it's easy to go with friends.

If you want to impress a date or visitors, then this is where you go. The tiny house nestled in an unsuspecting neighborhood is cute and adds to the entire vibe.  Reservations are the smartest way to go, but if you're just with one person then the bar is more than fine. The reservation system is different (you pay $25 a spot) but it all goes towards your bill and they add on tip. So, really not that weird in the end.  The food is amazing. My favorite entrees are the chicken and waffles and the steak. The waffles are much more savory than sweet and the chicken is super crispy and juicy. They cycle in and out new dishes every few months. I try to force myself to go for new things, but always find myself coming back to the classics (lobster mac n' cheese).   My suggestion is go with people who are cool with ordering lots of small plates and a couple entrees and sharing. There's so many amazing dishes you will want to taste everything you can.

The friendliest staff and delicious sweet drinks when you want a gut busting treat. The prices are also really great compared to most other places!   The stamp card is incentive enough to come back.

Went in for the first time this morning and had a great experience. The bottom line is that the guys were friendly, quick, and didn't try to BS me (which has happened to me many times at other shops). I waited in the waiting room for maybe 30 or 40 minutes at most.   I walked out paying $49 for a synthetic blend oil change. Make sure to use your yelp check-in too!   I will definitely be back for my next servicing.

The staff is always friendly and super quick. I know a lot of times people complain that non starbucks type places take too long but it certainly isn't the case here. The iced caramel is my go to and the matador is delicious but super rich and sweet.

This starbucks is incredibly B Team. I understand other locs being a little sluggish at off times but when I go at peak hours before work I have to ensure I have a solid 20 minutes to wait. They are slow at making drinks and always seem really confused. I avoid this location like the plague after giving it a shot 3 different times.  Drive up the road to Coffee Bean or support local places around the area.

The tortas are bomb. Tiny hole in the wall place in a somewhat suspect part of town. The employees don't speak English, but it really doesn't matter. The food is delicious and they make it super quick. The tortas have heaps of fresh avocado (more than more places would ever put on a single torta). You can get gut busting full for about 5 bucks.

Awesome local spot without the hipster pretentious attitude. The beans are amazing - I usually keep their in house Titus beans stocked at my house. The baked goods are to die for and worth all the calories. They are usually piping hot and fresh, too. I usually go for the Americano with some added agave syrup and a hot scone.   Only downside is one or two of the baristas can be a bit slow-mo but it's worth the wait.

Great vibes and awesome cocktails, but the menu has been lacking lately. I noticed they changed it up and there aren't very many options any more. The sandwiches are great, but who wants to be shoving a massive burger in their face on a date? If you DGAF what your date thinks, get the ruben. You won't look good eating it, but it's freaking good.  Order the fondue appetizer. It's worth it. I usually pass on dessert since they share a wall with Churn.    They just need to add some more variety back for dinner options.

The flavors are great and the quality is high. Friendly staff and loud music to distract long waits for the good stuff. The smores sundae is something you need to try once (warning: you will gain 4 lbs instantly). The Vietnamese coffee is out of this world!

I LOVE this studio. I was pretty intimidated and skeptical before I went to my first class due to some experiences in yoga where i felt like I was way too inexperienced to be there. However, I could not have been more wrong! The instructors make sure they pay attention to you (whether or not you are new) and will help you with modifications and useful corrections. There's nothing worse than going to a workout class where you keep doing the wrong thing over and over and over again. This definitely doesn't happen here. They won't let you cheat yourself on anything, but if you aren't super advanced you won't feel bad or embarrassed at all. The classes are fun, the music is loud, and the instructors are awesome. It never feels like an hour.   All the staff are great too, everyone knows your name and if they don't they make sure to ask. Can't say enough great things or stop recommending it to friends! The owners Veronica and Marirose are really genuine and their classes are super tough. Can't rave enough about all the instructors!

This place is truly a hidden gem. It's a semi spotty area surrounded by some industrial buildings but inside is clean.   The food is AMAZING and the staff is always really friendly and fast. The carnitas tacos are unreal - the meat is crispy and charred on the edges and they put a very generous amount of meat in their tacos. The prices are super fair especially considering the quality and amount of food they give you.  There's a drive-thru as well, but I prefer to go inside and utilize the fresh salsa bar.

This place is so good! I love coming here for a late breakfast (great walk of shame parade constantly streaming in Friday through Sunday). Last time a kid from ASU had one arm tattooed to say God's and the other said Gift. Those sort of patrons and people watching makes this an automatic 5 star review.   My go-to is the farmers benedict. The potatoes are amazing, and I love that there are endless bottles of hot sauce on deck. The service is quick and even when it's packed to the brim you will find a spot to sit.

Please find a better chef and this place will be a homerun! The ambiance overrides the food issues, but if they had a crappy location and no dog policy I would never come. The brunch deal is pretty crazy, but I noticed they changed the brunch menu recently and cheapened the food (maybe they realized it was too good of a deal). Dinner here leaves much to be desired...the ceasar salad with salmon was super blah. Sandwiches and burgers are the best bet to be satisfied. But...the atmosphere really can't be beat. Great spot for brunch with gal pals.

Brunch porn. Soft yolk dripping all over the place...ohh baby. This place is amazing and the cold drip coffee is to die. The menu is small but mighty. Very cute little spot that looks like the inside of an instagram. I love coming here on Saturday mornings for a quick bite.

This is one of my favorite spots in Phoenix! The food is awesome and the staff are always super quick and nice. The hostess usually over estimates how long your wait will be, which I think is a good thing. Last weekend I was told it would be 1 hour, but since someone takes your drink order while you wait, it was no problem. We ended up being sat right when we got our drinks - it couldn't have been more than 20 minutes or so.   The burrata is a must. It pretty much melts in your mouth. What I like most about Federal is how easy they are about subbing and changing their pizzas. Obviously you can make your own, but if you want to sub out things on pre-designed pies, it's no big deal.  I usually go for the manifesto and add an egg on top. If you're into eggs on things it's a must try here. One funny thing is that they don't have hard liquor - only wine and beer. However, they have a selection of house made wine coolers. Grapefruit ginger is perfect for summer.

Great local place. I love the shakes (too much)! A great alternative for in n out  if you want to support local biz or want to stay in the Arcadia central area. The drive thru is always fast and the staff is always friendly.  My only gripe is the ac is always FREEZING which deters me from ever wanting to eat inside.

Last night was honestly the most trying night of my life. My roommate sprinted into the living room screaming that a monster cockroach was chilling in her shower curtains. After over an hour of strategizing how to kill it without looking at it, we lost view of him. I had NEVER seen a cockroach in my apartment after over two years and this was an unfortunate surprise.  My roommate did research on pest control in town and found Insectek on Yelp and immediately called first thing in the morning. Thank goodness they were able to come out a mere hours later and blasted our entire apartment.   The tech was educational and kind and explained what he was doing throughout the apartment as well as next steps (i.e. don't fear when dead bugs start showing up).   Let's keep our fingers crossed this tragedy is behind us.

The staff is really friendly and quick. I usually split the blazing alaska (my favorite because of the thin sliced jalapeño) and another roll like a spicy salmon. The happy hour deals are pretty unbeatable and the lunch sashimi special is a good deal as well.  I wish they had less cream cheese integrated in the menu but that's just me. A lot of people really enjoy the cream cheese filled rolls.   Also a good place for take out if you live in the area.

Great spot to hang out or get some work done. I like this place because it has the charm and decor of a cool, independent coffee shop without the pretentious nature.   Food menu looked pretty solid, will definitely have to give it a go. Overall, good coffee, lots of beer and drinks to choose from, and really friendly staff.

Nikki is an amazing trainer. She's super motivating and genuinely nice. Madi and Missy are also great, so you can't really go wrong with any class.   All the workouts are different and fun so you don't notice an hour go by.

Way better than Blanco if you're looking for Americanized  Mexican food. The salsa isn't spicy enough that they bring out with the chips, but ask for the habanero instead if you like spicy food and they will gladly oblige. I have never had an issue with service. Always been prompt and polite.   The tacos are great and the food is moderately priced. Nice ambiance too. Perfect spot for a date night or girls' night out.

So fresh! This is my new favorite spot for sushi. The roll combinations are unique and I am yet to be disappointed. Highly recommend the Prince of Persia. It has just the right amount of crunch and fresh tuna. I love that they don't have BS rolls with cream cheese that are ultra deep fried. Only the real deal. The size of the special rolls are massive as well. You will get plenty full here.   The prices are very reasonable as well, even when you go Fri-Sat when "Happy Day" prices are not valid. Ended up getting 3 rolls and an appetizer to share for around 45 bucks. Not bad at all!

Amazing spot for a romantic night or a cozy night with friends. The location is huge making wait times much less than other locations. I came here on a Friday night past happy hour was over, but still found the prices very reasonable.   I shared a bottle of prosecco, a bruschetta board, and the raspberry chicken salad. Everything was great. The best bruschetta for savory lovers were the white bean and also the artichoke dip.   Sign up for the email list and you can get a free board too! (Worth about 14 dollars)  Definitely will be coming back to this spot often!

I have hosted multiple corporate events both for my department and for our external partners and have been extremely happy with the outcome. Booking and planning is always easy and quick, which makes my life so much easier. It feels nice to go into these events not stressed about the planning phase. My last event had only a few weeks notice, and luckily they were available and had the seating chart and food built out immediately for me.  Kelley is very quick to respond about any questions and can execute any specific requests. It is great to have meetings and events here as it is a quick transition into a happy hour with amazing ambiance.
