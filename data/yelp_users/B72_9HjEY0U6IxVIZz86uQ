I think I actually 'hate' this place. Strong words. It started many many years ago when my dad had me pick up an order here for carry-out. They forgot to make half the order and when I came back to get it - they didn't apologize for over-charging me, about forgetting the order or seem to notice I drove back to get it. I sat waiting for the order for. ever.   Forgetting to include food in a take-out order happens, it's a simple mistake, I get it. But they didn't respond appropriately, in any way at all, just kind of stood there like "soooo does this mean you want us to make it now...err...maybe?...well....hmmm.." My dad actually called the manager when I got back - the second time - and he didn't offer an apology or remedy the situation.   The food is just awful. I save the word "mediocre" for frozen wings, pizza & subs from the freezer section - Uncle Sam's is not worthy, it's gross.   If my review isn't enough to warn you to dine elsewhere, maybe the state's health inspection review is -   How bad is a restaurant that actually needs the government to tell them to get rid of roaches?   http://www.maricopa.gov/envsvc/envwebapp/tabs/results.aspx?navigatedFrom=businessResultsDrillDownAA&permit=FD-05575&business=Uncle%20Sam%27s%20Restaurant&address=10520%20N%2090th%20St  "OBSERVED TWO LIVE ROACHES PRESENT UNDER EQUIPMENT IN BAR.

I can't really explain "dentist anxiety" to someone who doesn't relate. I prioritize a healthy, white smile as much as anyone, but going to the dentist is not something I ever look forward to.   This office alleviated my dentist anxiety within the first couple minutes of stepping in. The staff are all friendly, the waiting room is unlike any 'waiting room' you've been in before (in a good way) and Dr. Sielicki herself is amazing.  I have since referred my mom to see Dr. Sielicki, who has also had a good experience. My mom's had icky dental drama and Dr. Sielicki spent a time giving her options, going over procedures, recommendations, etc.

I've lived in Scottsdale since 1994 and didn't eat Redendo's pizza until now. I have been missing out.  I turned to Yelp because my aunt was visiting us from Southern California and was in the mood for pizza. The pressure was on to find the best pizza place in town and Redendo's is literally the highest rated pizza place in Scottsdale.   We checked out the Yelp reviews and ordered the Popeye's Pizza based on the recommendations. Spinach, goat cheese, garlic & ricotta, oh my! This pizza is amazing, we ordered 2 other ones (plain cheese & veggie), but the Popeye's was gone in 2 seconds.  I don't know if they deliver - we ordered carry out. They have cute little "parking meters" out front so don't panic like I did, they are for decoration.   My only lament is that I wish they had a more standard veggie pizza that was easier to order a pizza loaded with veggies. If you "build your own" it gets too expensive for a veggie pizza - but the ingredients are good so, sure, it's worth it, but ya know.   The prices in general - fyi - aren't cheap - but did I mention this was amazing pizza? Order the Popeye's Pizza!

Cien Agaves, you have potential, but you let me down.  On the plus side, happy hour is decent at half price appetizers, free chips & salsa and cheap drinks. I've been here 6 times for happy hours and decided to use my Living Social deal for a dinner last weekend.   Bad decision, my happy hour memories are ruined. Stale chips, slow and awful service and I found a hair in the free salsa and had an overall horrible experience. I used a Living Social deal for $10 for $20 and the visit solidified my decision to not go back again, not even for happy hour.  The service is awful, the hostess doesn't greet people as they enter or say goodbye as they leave...I never thought I'd notice a hostess so much until I saw how little this one did. She spent most the time picking at her nails while at the front.   We had a party of 5 total and 3 of them came after we had already ordered our drinks. Our server never took drink orders for them and we had to grab her to order more food.   Our food wasn't bad, but it wasn't that good. Service was horrible, but they didn't even seem that busy.  We would have ended up spending a lot more $ here on food and drinks but decided to go other places in old town to get good service.  Management...please take the helpful hints, because I know you can be a good restaurant.

One of my favorite sushi places in old town, soon to be yours too.   Best happy hour, super busy though. Half price drinks, appetizers & house maki (get the chicken gyoza - you're welcome in advance). I've ordered different rolls here and favorites are the freshwater eel roll, cali roll and dragon roll.   Kudos for *consistently* fresh sushi served at a good temperature - but it could be rolled a little bit tighter, sometimes they seem to fall apart easily. Actually, every roll here falls apart, it's predictable.   I've spent less than $20 with another person on 2 different rolls, saki bombers and an appetizer.  Servers are always sweet and seem to have fun here, I dig the vibe. I always feel like they work together to help each other out so we get our food & refills faster - I hope they tip their bussers well.   And...definitely check out the bathrooms, like a trip to Japan.

What?? Who knew this amazing restaurant was here. This place was so hard to find, but we drove around the area persistently to eat here once we saw the reviews on Yelp.  It's pretty small but very impressive. Service was great, food was better, prices are really reasonable.  My friend got the meatloaf - it was encrusted with bacon and he really liked it. I got the berry salad with granola - amazing. Fresh, colorful green leaves and ripe berries.  It looks like this place might fill up pretty quickly & there aren't a lot of tables, I have no clue if they take reservations but I'd recommend them. Great place for dinner.  We were happy with all the main dishes so we also got creme brulee - it was good but not the best, I'd probably skip dessert next time.   I'll definitely be back, I want to try the pizza/flatbread, looked so good.

We decided to call Ben after finding him on Yelp, definitely glad we did.   Ben was responsive and reliable but I am mostly grateful for his honesty. He didn't try to "upsell" me on chemicals or products (some pool cleaning guys make you feel like you're at a sketchy auto shop).   He's friendly and the advice and information he gave me during my initial call to request his pool assistance made me feel like my pool was in good hands.   When I called him, I told him my pool looked like a stagnant pond and he recommended I use chlorine to help get the pool-restoration ball rolling before he was able to arrive. He told me how much it would cost, where to get it and how to use it, and recommended against using shock to save $.   I've worked with a lot of different pool cleaners in the valley and his prices have been the most competitive.
