I drove by and saw the car I wanted for a steal of a deal. Low miles, great price, and in amazing shape. The needed new tires, but that seemed to be the only issue.  I go in, buy the car, am told a specific price for my payment including warranty and GAP insurance. I sign the contracts, everything is gravy.  I call back a few days later in regards to the tires, as I see that they are ready for immediate replacement. This was a make or break deal, as SUV tires are $150-$200 each. The sales manager agrees to replace two of them, which wasn't ideal, but it was a start. I am asked by the finance person working with me that I need to come sign my contracts again, as my interest raised slightly. I get there, and see that my payment skyrocketed, and I didn't have GAP insurance, only the warranty (which I didn't want). I ask for the warranty to be removed, only to be told no. It's not that I couldn't afford the payment, I just didn't want it....reluctantly signing my life away. I leave again.  Over the next week I hear a squeaking noise as I back up, and am immediately concerned by this. I am then told that this is a normal noise for a Toyota, and that everything checked out on my vehicle. I get my tires replaced, only to hear a new noise yesterday. It sounds like a whistling noise when I brake. I couldn't be more annoyed with this, as they said everything looked good on my car. I just feel like I am going to keep shelling out money for this car, and that's why the price was so cheap. Subtract $800 for the tires and $200 for the brakes and I probably am right where I should have paid for the friggin thing.  Now let me say this, Scott and Gia over on the Subaru side are amazzzzzzing! Caleb in finance was also a decent person to work with.  I just don't approve of the whole your car is fine conversation when I am clearly experiencing issues. I don't appreciate any sort of deception. Which is all I seemed to have dealt with.

Major suck.  I have been here 3 times with three separate vehicles. I think "Hey? Why not try again?"  Every time I get my car washed here I feel like they always forget something: the very bottom of your front and rear bumpers, the water that dripped from your liftgate onto the bumper, anything on the windshield that isn't dust......   I could go on and on, but my point is that they don't seem to care, they just want their tip and you leave. I feel bad so I tip, as it's hot and I sure as hell ain't doing the job.  Go somewhere where your car actually comes out clean though.

Taken my dog Denny here a few times and they have been prompt, fair, and courteous. Plus, they take CareCredit so it's not a nightmare tying to budget vet bills.

the food is decent. i would recommend the carrot cinnamon cumin soup every time!  ^ i started writing that about two months ago....ive been back once or twice since.  the service leaves MUCH to be desired. i don't know what it is about servers down here, but when i served up in northern az...we did something called hustling. they take forever to bring you anything you may need.  most of what i have tried has been a bit bland. except for the amazing carrot cinnamon cumin soup. lol.

Now, I'm going to give this restaurant a poor review not because of the food (because we all know that it's the bomb.com), but I'm specifically referring to my most recent experience.   I ordered a to-go order, as I live right around the corner. I was quoted 15 minutes. This was a Tuesday evening. Apparently, they were slammed and this wasn't usual. However, I came 20 minutes later and my food wasn't ready. This is excusable, it was busy.   However, I waited to simply be acknowledged standing at the cash register for almost 5 minutes. It's a small restaurant, I'm not invisible in the place. I finally pay, and then my food is handed to me. No big deal, right?  I get home, and realize that both of the precious deep fried quesadillas are barely edible. They had been so overcooked that they were mostly solid dark matter on the inside. I was heartbroken, but decided that I would call back the next morning to mention it, because they were busy.   That was a mistake, I was told that the owner is only there on two specific days of the week, and of course, that wouldn't be there until the following week. They wouldn't provide me a number for the owner (nor a name now that I think about it). I left my name and phone number, and still haven't received a phone call. This was two weeks ago.   So...I'm not happy, and I probably won't eat there again based off of the principle. Which sucks, because I like the food, but hate the service thus far.

Yvonne was super amazing and very thorough on assisting me with getting my vehicle repaired. Although they were minor, my vehicle is a new model and the parts had to be special ordered. I had it back within a week, definitely would recommend this repair shop if you're a USAA member!

This was third visit to Rice Paper, and with each visit, my experience got worse and worse.  I was super excited to have Pho so close to my home, and I loved my experience the first time, which was definitely due to the server. My second experience involved me having to ask for actual iced tea since the one they served me was so watered down it looked like dirty water.  Today, however, was the final straw. Not only did it take 5 minutes to be brought drinks, but the waiter/bartender/guy with the Sanford & Son mustache was awful. We were the only table in the restaurant, and he still gave poor service. He ran his busser ragged once it began to get busier, and when he noticed we tipped his busser and said "this is for you, and only you," he came up and threw the ticket down on the table in front of us.   I also didn't mention I had to get up and ask for Hoisin sauce, and when the busboy took it to be boxed up, I heard comments about how I used too much sauce in my broth, or some nonsense.  Between this and the Ikea catalog vomiting into the interior, I would stay away.

Duh. Because this place is the bomb.com! The pancakes and homemade preserves are the best! I usually always get the salami scramble and the lemonade.....and an extra pancake. Because fat.

Absolutely love this place. My dog is a handful, and they have been very patient with working with him. I've also had him groomed once so far there and they gave him a cute little bandana afterward! Would definitely recommend if your dog needs a little extra attention during the day when you're away.

Brad really went above and beyond to help me and my roommate get our condo all taken care of. We were having problems with small spiders and beetles and the occasional roach, and he was more than happy to explain over the phone and via text what creatures this treatment would help prevent in the home. He was very helpful with explaining how long to keep pets and ourselves out of the home after treatment. Additionally, he treated our exterior and patio as well. It was a very fair price and he gave us options without obligating us to sign a contract. We will most definitely be seeing him on a more frequent basis.

headed in since i live right behind this place. that, and it had great reviews. we had the al pastor pizza, which was absolutely fantastic. the green chile cucumber ranch was awesome as well. it's a combination of table service and self service, which was actually a pretty awesome experience. the owner was friendly, and was very interested in us having the best possible experience. will definitely visit again.

Good was absolutely delicious. Was in the mood for Italian, but the roommate and I wanted something new to try. So happy I found this place. The zucchini fritte was delicious. As was the penne pasta. We also had a small board, and it was also amazing. Will definitely come back.
