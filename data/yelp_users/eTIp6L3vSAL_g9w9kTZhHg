So first of all what chiropractic office has a dog in it? So unsanitary. Not to mention the constant barking while I was supposed to be  getting adjusted. So after I paid and left I knew I wasn't adjusted correctly seeing as I go to the joint once a week. The only reason I chose to go here was because my normal doc was off that day and it was kinda an emergency. I went to a different location the following day and they told me I would have to pay again or go back to the same location. I called the original location to see if there was another doc there that day that could re adjust me and was told I would have to repay. For what? I didn't even get what I paid for due to the distracted doctor and his dog and children ........ Not to mention I was a foot taller then me and he did half my adjustment standing lmfao. Really? This is awful customer service and not at all how you run a business seeing as the doctor is also the owner ....... You have one very unhappy client and I will not be back and would recommend that you do either...

Do not go thru the Tempe location you will here five different stories from five different people none of them will match up you will be paying extra money for  appointments that they've messed up do not go to this location. People are very nice they just don't all know the rules and when it comes down to it you can't be playing around w your interlock and risk having it longer or paying money you don't actually owe
