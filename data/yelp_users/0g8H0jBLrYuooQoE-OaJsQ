This place was below average. Specializing in breakfast, I'd think it would have been better. Denny's is a better alternative.

Best place for tires and wheels. Getting my rotation on.

Macayo's used to be decent but over the years the food has gone downhill. I refuse to eat here and only went because we met friends there. The salsa taste like it comes from a can, the food is far from authentic. If you're in the area, Manuel's is a better alternative. If  you're looking for real mexican food, go to Tony's or Zamora's.

This is Litchfield Park's version of Cheers. Great food, amazing staff, perfect place if you're a local because you'll run into someone you know. Even if you're visiting, everyone is friendly in The Park. Enjoy!

Very tranquil place to eat with a beautiful patio. The menu has a variety so no problem finding something that you'd like. Just right portions and can't beat the complimentary Champagne with brunch.

First class all the way. This place is nestled in the Town of Carefree. The staff, the service, the property is outstanding. We live in AZ and felt miles away from home. Very tranquil and laid back. This is a great alternative to Sedona. In fact, we'll visit the Boulders quite a bit more now.

Great place for something light to eat, nice size wine selection, tons of rare and micro beers. Friendly staff, skip Starbucks and support this local business for coffee.

Very good brick oven pizza. This place would be much more amazing if it had a wine list and wait staff. Overall, the pizza is great if you like brick oven pizza. One of the best place to get a pizza in the West Valley.

If you like it hot, this is your place. It is a bit pricier then other Mexican restaurants but the portions are large and don't taste like it was frozen and just warmed up... cough, cough Macayos! Great specials on the happy hour menu. Friendly staff, nice atmosphere and the hatch chilies are their staple. The salsa is great and the bean dip is a nice change with the chips.

I gave this place 2 stars. One for the service and one for the ambiance. The pizza reminded me of Pizza Hut, but it was $23 for a medium. Tons of choices on the menu, nothing authentic. The appetizers seemed to be frozen finger foods warmed up and the pizza is terrible and to make it worse extremely overpriced. If you're staying at the Boulders, skip this place and go to the Spotted Donkey or somewhere off sight.
