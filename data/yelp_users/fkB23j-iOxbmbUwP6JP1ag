Place is awesome!  Tier 1 food.  Staff is great.  Megan was an amazing waitress.  Fast, funny, great smile and good recommendations.  Terrific ambience.  A little pricey so bring your wallets gentlemen.  It will be a good night.

Ordered for delivery and it never showed up.  I'd put zero stars if yelp let me.  Now I have to go down to there establishment and pick up my food that they charged me for over 1 and a half hours ago.  Unacceptable.  Fuck this place!

I don't usually create reviews, but...  Had lunch here for the first time and it was terrible.  Asked for the burger to be cooked medium and received a well done burger.  Tastes like rubber.  Received our appetizer within 20 mins and the meal within 2 mins after the appetizer.  Had to send back the appetizer.  The waiter mixed up our meal with the other tables meal.  I overheard her send back the sandwich we ordered.  This place is not busy and there is no excuse for it.  I am disappointed and will not return.  I'm sure their doors will close if they don't change their business.

First and foremost, I am very particular with my hair and I make critical judgements with the way people cut my hair.  I must say Tony is the man!  Great attention to detail and has great advice for the look you want.  Hospitality is amazing.  I will be a regular.  Thanks Tony!

Great customer service and the best flavor ever!  I would recommend the Tom Nak Soup with coconut milk.  Amazing!

Best barbershop in the East Valley.  My boy Panda kills it.  Gabe fades up nice as well.  It's well worth your time to check them out.
