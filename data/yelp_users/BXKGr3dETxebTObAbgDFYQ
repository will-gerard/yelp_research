Dr. Petermann does a great job for people injured in car accidents.  His patients love him and he will take very good care of you!!!  Highly recommended!!!

Fantastic wine list by the glass, bruchetta, antipasto, and cheese plate is amazing!  They also have soup, salads, and other appetizer like stuff.  Great swanky wine bar type place.  Everything is delicious!!!

I have eaten at Pepin 3-4 times and the food is decent, the wine is good, and it is fun to watch the dancing.  Its usually a little warm in there also.  I am writing this review to conplain about terrible and inhospitable service.  I went there recently with a date and another couple to eat and drink and watch salsa.  We were very dressed up and ready to start the night out.  When I got there, I said 'four for dinner' and asked when the dancing started.  The moron that was apparently hosting and completely devoid of social skills asked if we were eating.  I said yes, and drinking.  And he then asked how much we were going to order.  I was confused and then asked why?  He said because there is a cover charge if you don't order that much.  After again saying that we were there to eat and drink and jokingly inquiring if I was doing something wrong, I was again admonished about the cover charge if we don't order enough.    I then took my group elsewhere.  I would have paid a charge hapily if it was on the bill.  I do not like the inquisition at the host area.  In this case it was insulting and embarressing and I took my business elsewhere, for a $280+ dinner at Cowboy Ciao.  I hope someone in charge at Pepin reads this and educates the ignorant host on common courtesy and customer service.

I have known Woodrow Thompson for years.  I am another lawyer in the community handling car accident and civil cases.  Mr. Thompson is very bright, capable and an excellent lawyer.  He has my recommendation!

Great beer on tap. Delicious pizza, appetizers, and food. Small parking lot so you usually valet at peak hours.

The beer selection is delicious and the food is amazing.  Fantastic food and dining experience and beautiful ambiance.  I was all excited to write a review thinking that I would be one of this first and I am happy to see that there are 111 positive reviews.  The Arcansani and bruchettas are fabulous as the other yelpers mention, but I have eaten here three times and everything on the menu is delicious.  Amazing dining experience and even reasonably priced!  Five stars!!!
