First and most importantly, this place has excellent, fresh sushi.  Tried the albacore sashimi, uni, salmon sashimi in a salad with truffle oil, vegas roll, and seaweed salad.  Only disappointing dish was the uni.  The rest were superb.  Total bill was under $75 including tip and 5 drinks (most everything was happy hour priced).  Friendly service at the sushi bar and a fun atmosphere.  Good date place.

3.5 Stars for Rum Bar, 4.0 for BreadFruit.  Bar was out of ginger beer, which eliminated the best cocktails on the menu.  Those that I tried instead were just ok.  But interesting cocktail menu with decent happy hour options (at $5).  I agree with the prior reviews on Breadfruit -- quality food, authentic menu, good service, but higher prices than what you'd expect.  Good tunes on the playlist and a good first date place.

Excellent meatball pho.  Prices are higher than other Vietnamese restaurants ($7-8 for a big bowl of pho) but the interior is very nice and service is good.

Great local place (as are the other locations in the Valley).  Good happy hour and daily specials.  This one (on Indian School) has particularly good service and usually a decent crowd.  Good for lunch, happy hour, dinner, weekends, just about any time.

Nice atmosphere, good service, and good food by AZCenter standards.  Good happy hour menu and choices.  Good beer list.  Solid "good" in every respect.

Oh south tempe how u disappoint. This may be the highest yelp-rated neighborhood joint but only because SoTempe's standards are so low. Worthless waitress who knew nothing about the otherwise impressive beer list. 10$ short vodka drink for the wife (more than Scottsdale). Awful soup with watered-down bbq sauce as the broth.  Bitter caesar salad. Flatbread was passable only bc it tasted like the trader joes ingredients I buy myself.  Great playlist but volume at 1 to appease all the gray hairs in the joint (on a Saturday night at 8:00).  Only part of "gastropub" this place has right is the beer list.

Boring.  Uninspired.  Generally sauce-less, which means the meat courses are plain and dry.  The salmon tastes like styrofoam.  The filet is flavorful but they use low quality cuts.  The veggies are simply steamed.  No doubt the options are healthy, but at the sacrifice of flavor.  When I pay this much to eat out, I want to taste it and enjoy it.

The best neighborhood bar in South Tempe.  Great beer list with regularly changing options, many on tap.  Knowledgable and polite bartenders.  Good variety on the menu, and the few things I've tried have been good.

This might be the least expensive tablecloth/full-service - type restaurant I've ever been to.  First trip had an excellent pork banh mi ($4), second trip had a huge spring roll ($2) and big bowl of chicken pho ($5).  All have been excellent and comparable in flavor/quality to my favorite Vietnamese places.  It's easy to miss - look for the white building with a round, red logo painted on the front, just to the West of 13th Pl, and park behind it.

I hate the Scottsdale location and Biltmore location is passable. Airport Blanco is superior for both food and service. Ask for Jodi.

This place is firing on two of four cylinders.  Food excellent; Vibe cool; Service surprisingly bad; Prices surprisingly high.  Showed up with two adults and three kids at 6:45.  Food arrived at 7:45.  Total bill was $107 even with free kids meals.  There are dozens of other family restaurants where we would have had a better experience for half the price.
