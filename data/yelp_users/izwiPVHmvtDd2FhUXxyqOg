Great food - reasonable prices - the lamb was exceptional as well as the pork souvlaki. Rice and salad were also exceptional - definitely a return visit is in order.

The best gelato around short of being in Spain - not as creamy and the selection seems to stay very regular vs. new flavored but still no better around.

Pros: Beer Cheese - Great / IPA - Great  Cons: Everything else. This place could really use to clean up a bit - very dirty, poor set up for people to have room, furniture and chairs wobbly and sub quality. Service was also sub par - in fact they overcharged me on my debit purchase where the tip was concerned....there was no tip and they added one...so very shady and I will not go back based on that.   San Tan Brewery has a much nicer atmosphere, much cleaner, and the service is night and day compared to this place. Think of a dive bar with one good beer - of thats what you want -- You'll get it @ AZ Wilderness Brewing.

Still sitting here - beer is great / appetizers like the pizza (tastes like microwave version) and pretzels ( like super pretzel from Costco with a bad queso dip) however the Tuscan kale salad was extremely good - I would not come here again except for happy hour for beer
