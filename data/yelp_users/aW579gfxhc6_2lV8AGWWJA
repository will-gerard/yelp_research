The food was great and the waiter Patrick was very attentive. We were the last ones to leave on a Saturday night. My cell phone was left on the seat. After realizing while still in the car I called and there was no answer. The next day no one could find it. I strongly recommend not to bring anything of value to this restaurant, cause the employees will not turn it in to lost and found

Okay, the only reason I went here was because when I searched Yelp for wings they were the closest  place. Once I saw that everyone said they had good wings I had to try them. Plus I was craving for wings, and Honey Bears (which is way closer) only sells wings on Mondays. For some reason on Mondays I never want wings.   So anyway, I placed my order over the phone, and when I got there they already boxed up and ready.  The picture made me think the wings were bigger. They looked so little in the big togo box, which could have been half the size to fit 12. The order of a dozen cost $7.50. I thought that was a good price thinking the wings were way bigger. So I was disappointed for about 30 seconds till I had my first bite. The wings were DELISH!!! It was worth every penny.  This place a small bar with very little walking space. I can only imagine if I came during happy hour or when a big game was on. I would give them 3.5 stars, but the wings really help. If nothing else come for the wings. They are Awesome!

Love my Dentist and Hygienist!!!  I started going here in 06. They were my 1st  choice because they were right next to where I worked at that time. So it was easy to go there over my lunch. Now in 07, I moved to Seattle and back to Phoenix in 08. Even though I live clear across town about 20-25 mins drive, I still would never go to another dentist. Besides the great service which I have become accustomed to, they also have video games in the waiting room (when I have my 10 yr old nephew), flats screens in the back, and of course those awesome cookies, with juice and water in the fridge waiting for you afterwards!  I've never waited too long before any appointment. I typically get there right on time, and they are ready for me. Love them, Love them, Love them. I always have the same Hygienist too. I feel like I'm going to see an old friend. This is as good as it gets.

Just Love this place! My hair stylist is in the same parking lot, so when I was hungry last time it was the closest place and the most healthy. They offered this great market salad! A combination of 3 salads. One included  fresh sliced Strawbrries. They were so sweet and juicy. Yum!! They also had a variety of Quiches. I choose the mushroom/spinanch quiche. OMG to die for!! Then I also got the apple tart pie, which was excellent! I love deserts and you can tell they used fresh ingredients. I would recommend this place to most people especially if you like to remain on the healthy side when eating out, but also have a sweet tooth. Like myself. There is a great selection to choose from for the desserts. Oh and when you order in, the presentation of the food is picture perfect. I've ate there twice and I'll be back!
