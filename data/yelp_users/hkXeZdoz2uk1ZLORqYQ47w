Ok...I know we live in Arizona...and have alot of great authentic Mexican restaurants around...that being said....I frequent Abuelos about once every two weeks....be it with co workers or with my wife. I give this place 5 stars.....  I know it's a chain but I think the food is tasty...the ambience is really very nice too. Relatively speaking its cheap too. I think their chips and salsa are pretty good. I usually judge Mexican restaurants based on their chili rellenos they have two kinds one filled with cheese and the other shredded beef...both are delicious.   They have the standard rice and beans that most Mexican restaurants serve with everything...but they have an option called "papas con chili" ...imagine a cheesy mashed potato casserole...I don't think Mexican when I request it with the rice because I'm not a big fan of beans....but I still think it tastes good.  I recommend this place if your looking for a good bite! I've probably been here a total of 15 times or so...and have never had a poor experience.

This place is great. Took my wife and mother there this morning for breakfast. It's in old town Gilbert next to Oregano's and across from Joes real BBQ. Impressed with their expresso bar food and service. Highly recommend. Want to go back for lunch and/or dinner soon.

This place is pretty awesome. They have some great beef jerky and snack sticks. The topper is they carry Gates BBQ sauce. Why 4 stars? They don't have prime cuts.

I like this place. I've been here twice now with the wife. And both times we really liked the food. Elmer's is pretty much right next door. This place seems much cleaner, organized and professional. They have great tortas too. They have Sonoran hot dogs here... Fair warning...I've never had the original from Tucson...but these babies are pretty good with everything on them.

Fantastic. My wife and I went on a Friday night. I knew right away when everyone coming in was a regular, that we were in for a treat. This place is right by our house in a non descript shipping center, that we've driven by hundreds of times. We found it on yelp tonight and saw the positive reviews. They deserve it.   I could tell the owners were Korean, because they spoke it. I believe it's a family restaurant and they are very aware that positive reviews are return customers are driving their business. For a Friday night it wasn't really too busy, when we arrive we were seated right away and had the option of seating. At the risk of writing a positive review and their business improving so much that next time we have to wait. They deserve it.  Beyond the basics they have an Extensive roll menu, some you've heard of and some house rolls.  Food was fantastic. Rice seasons well and didn't fall apart. Fish is FRESH!  Fish to rice ratio was perfect. We too, will soon be those regulars ;)  That's it. Try it or don't, just my opinion ;)

What can I say. It's a candy warehouse! If you like only the white gummy bears...you can buy only the white gummy bears. This place has a lot of those throw back candies that are hard to find. I highly recommend this place if you have a sweet tooth, or if you are looking for something in particular. They have something for everyone young or old.

Being Chinese, and having hot pot alot as a kid, this restaurant was disappointing. I expected a hot pot restaurant to be fill with Asians hunkered over steaming troughs of soup. This restaurant is trying to make the hot pot experience as what I would describe as "urban chic". I should have known seeing the clientele. No Asians eating here on a Saturday night. Although I appreciate the variety of vegetable and protein choices available, I must agree with the other reviewers that the menu is expensive. If you are a hot pot purest this place isn't for you.
