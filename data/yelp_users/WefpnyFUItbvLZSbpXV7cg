The owner Jeff was very professional. He showed up when he said he was going to to rekey all the locks on the home and reprogram the garage door opener. He went above and beyond to do some things were not originally on the list.  Thought I was going to have to run back to Home Depot to purchase smaller padlocks to put on the outside gates of the home but Jeff was able to make an adjustment on the clasps to make my padlocks work as well. His value was excellent.  I would refer him to anybody just as I was referred to him by a realtor.

Super friendly staff and clean environment at a reasonable price. So many things on the menu to choose from and everything I saw on the tables looked great.

First time here as I just moved into the neighborhood. I guarantee I won't be back. They are friendly at the counter but the food is lackluster at best. I got the turkey sandwich and the 2 slices of turkey were paper thin. I basically paid for a chunk of bread and some musty alfalfa sprouts.  They are definitely overpriced for the portions. I can't see this establishment lasting long as people expect good food for a fair price but I can't see paying $6 to $9 for a medium size sub with these kind of portions and quality. You're better off heading about 2 minutes West and go to their competition. I'll say the establishment was clean and the young man behind the counter was polite.  I would hope you would change your ways or go out of business and someone else can move into the space that might want to add value to the neighborhood

There was 9 people before me that got there order , our order was simple and I had to go to them and say I see my order sitting there. I did grab a to go menu button rolled up in a ball and threw it in the parking lot.  Junk service when busy that's for sure.  You may see a line to the door, but I'm thinking its because they are sooo slow.  I do hope the food is better than the service.  Wait, it must because how much worse than junk does it get.  I will not be back and don't recommend.   Your reputation did not meet the standards I would have expected based on the plaques on the wall..  I go out to dinner 3-4 Days a week.  If you remotely like even Good food, this is Not the place for you.

The service was horrible, the food was even worse and the bathrooms we are atrocious. First plate of food came out cold and had to send it back.  Another person from our group ordered jalapeno sliders and each came with one single small slice of jalapeno.  Tater tots we're disgusting with cheese that seem like it came out of the freezer minutes before they put over semi warm food.  I saw a glimpse of the kitchen which in would not serve my worst enemies out of.  People in the penitentiary would send back the food from this kitchen.   Bone Appetit

The burger was amazing and the fresh home made chips with yogurt dill dipp is great also.  Steak salad was yummy minus the fact they gave us a plastic knife to cut it.  Almost impossible but the quality is excellent.

Stealing from you left and right, not once but twice.  Yes stealing! They tell you the price as $1 more than the cost they ring into the register.  Once again, not once but Twice to both myself and a friend.  It may not seem like a big deal, but it's Stealing from a patron no matter how you slice it.  I spoke with a manager about it and informed him I would Yelp it.  I was asked not to Yelp it after mentioning it.  The manager Jason was professional/courteous and apologetic, he informed the staff member and I did not see her return to her station/post.  I live nearby and hope that visitors are aware. Go somewhere where they are honest, not just say sorry.  I had to edit and make people aware that the manager did find us as we were leaving and offered to purchase drinks for us but it was time to move on for the night.
