Sweet Salon is inviting and everyone is very friendly.  Angela is fabulous!  I had been searching for a good salon and hair dresser on the west side of the city since moving here a few years ago.  Angela has done a great job with all cut, color, highlight, and low light styles I have had done.  I would highly recommend her to anyone.

Purchased a duct cleaning on Living Social.  # on deal was disconnected and voucher immediately marked as redeemed by vendor.  After getting the correct # from living social I made an appointment that they changed with less than 12 hours notice.  Technician showed up 5 minutes past the rescheduled two hour window claiming check engine light came on.  Service van looked less than desirable.  Upon entering my home the first statement was you have two units so it will be an additional $99.  This was no where to be found in the fine print.  It only stated one per household (technician couldn't show me where it was written either).  I chose to decline the service.  I was called by the company 3 days later - they say they will refund me what I was charged but then proceeded to tell me how great their company was and I will never get anything better and that I was wrong for turning them away.
