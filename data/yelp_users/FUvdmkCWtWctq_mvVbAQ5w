When I used to work in downtown Phoenix I'd come here for lunch if I hadn't brought mine. I'd always get the pasta special which comes with the pasta, soup, bread stick, and a drink. You can get a free refill.  A few times I got a breakfast burrito there and they're made to order. They were decent.  Its unfortunate that this is the only affordable place to eat anything in downtown Phoenix. Sometimes Sheriff Joe and his security team eat here if you'd like to catch a glimpse of him.  On rare occasions the owners are rude. But that's rare so maybe they were having a bad day.

I definitely agree with Amy A.'s review.  I came here tonight (a Tuesday evening around 5:00). I could count on my hand the number of other people in the place. There were two servers and one cook. The other people already had their food. We sat down and still waited 5-10 minutes before a server came and greeted us, asking what we'd like to drink. We each ordered a coffee and I a drink. Another 10 minutes go by before we get our coffee...but no water! She took our food order...pork chops for me and eggs for who I was with. Not a hard order. 30 minutes later they finally come back and my water is still no where to be seen (it came a couple minutes later).  The pork chops were rubbery and had nothing to them. It came with hashbrowns and salad from a bag. Her scrambled eggs weren't cooked all the way. When we asked for more coffee she didn't come back. We finally had enough and got up to go. Can you believe that the server had lost our ticket? So she made up some number and charged us.  Never coming back and this experience has put me off from any Waffle House. The place was unsanitary: flies, gross build up on the table edges, sticky floor, splotches on the tables, etc. You'd think this Waffle House in particular would look much better and have better service being so close to a decent hotel and sort of off the I-10. The location at Baseline and Priest is much better. They're normally packed but deliver impeccable service. Doesn't matter we're not going to any one of these places again. 1 star is too much.

These are good hamburgers! They keep them right in front of you (behind the counter). Fries are crispy.  The ambiance could be better but the food is good.

We came here on Father's Day. The food wasn't good at first because the noodles weren't cooked all the way! HOWEVER, our server and the manager more than made up for it. The manager had actually gone around earlier giving all the dad's a $10 gift card for next time. When our server mentioned to him our uncooked noodles, he came over with freshly made dishes we had ordered to go and a cake we didn't order to show his apologies. Great! A few minutes later, the waiter came by and explained that everything was taken care of and we didn't have to pay anything. Not for our drinks, not for the bread sticks, salad, my meal (which was different from the other three I was with and was actually fine)...nothing. I was taken aback because I wasn't expecting it to be free.  I don't condone complaining about a place after you've ordered but the noodles were uncooked in the chicken alfredo.   We'll be coming back because my fiance loves Olive Garden. I think they're all over priced and I personally feel I can make any of it much better and for cheaper, but hey she likes the bread sticks.

This has got to be the nices Arby's I've ever been in. Most of them are spaced strangely like the one close to Baseline and 7th St. in Phoenix.  The service was great. Food made fresh and they call out to you with a smile on their face. They say goodbye! when you're leaving. Food itself was your typical Arby's. I gotta figure out where I can buy my own Arby's Sauce though.

I came in here about 1 hour before closing and there were a couple people in the chairs getting their haircuts done. One of the ladies came up to me, not even looking at me, and said there would be a 1 hour wait. I said "ok" and she walked away with this expression on her face as though she had seen something disgusting. I guess I'm gross but whatever. I'm not coming here again for that reason, just all around rude and not worth the price.  And I don't care if someone replies several months later to somebody else's post in some sort of bid to see who is awesome (see Tammi H. vs. Gina H.). For a place called "cost cutters" its really no different than any other haircut place, other than rude 20 somethings running the place.

This place is nice. There are some awesome deals to be had and you can get local stuff, which is nice. Some of the reviews here make it seem like when it gets crowded then you're screwed. We went on a Sunday around noon and it was crowded but manageable. Someone also said there isn't any air conditioning. That's not true. There's an evap unit you can clearly see on the roof and inside its cool.  Some things like tortillas are about the same you can get at a chain grocery store.  Checking out was ok if you're a guy like myself. They didn't say a word to me except for the total amount. I imagine if you're more into talking at the register then it wouldn't be too inviting.   The rows (aisles here) are not so wide.  When I was there the deals that I can remember were:  -6 little mangoes for $1 -2 larger mangoes for $1 -Bag of potatoes for about $3 -6 things of cilantro for $1 -8 things of parsley for $1 -Watermelon 15 cents per pound

This is strictly a review of the food. The service was good but the food could have been much better. I won't compare it or say I should have gone to XYZ, but its nothing to write home about in my opinion. Better options out there.

Something about this particular Applebee's is off-putting. The food wasn't as good as others, the interior wasn't as inviting and like others, the waiters would all meet up at the bar and talk to each other until someone walked in to be seated.  Would be ideal if they moved out and they were replaced. Will try to avoid it.

Just go here for their desserts. So many times, including tonight, have I eaten here and found my fries and chicken to be lukewarm to cold. They also have half their sodas out of order every time.

This place has great food but the prices are a little on the expensive side and the wait staff stand around as though they're prison guards watching you.

I guess you could say that service beats what the food actually tastes like to me. The food wasn't awesome in my opinion that other Yelpers have you suggest, but then again I've only had it once but will definitely try it again.  Walked in and was kind of taken aback at first. Its set up like Los Taquitos over in Ahwatukee: shotgun straight to the back where you order food, with sets of tables on either side. There's a bathroom, too. It didn't seem inviting but it works. You can either read a menu or they have pictures on the wall of everything you could order.  Its the owner who took our order and he was very friendly and professional. We sat down later and he brought us our drinks with chips and salsa. The salsa is on a little on the spicy side. Our food soon came and they're decent portions. He would frequently check up on us to make sure everything was ok.  One interesting thing was that an elderly lady and a little girl came in and just sat down. They didn't order anything. The owner asked them if they were ok and they said they were just waiting. A couple minutes later he brings them chips and salsa too. I felt that was nice of him even though they hadn't ordered anything (or hadn't yet at least).  This, for me, is another one of those places where I might go back if I happen to be there. I do recommend it to at least try once. I saw that they have pazole which I'll have to try some time.

I came in about an hour before closing and the staff there were rude. The food wasn't all that good. I had high hopes that other reviews were wrong but I agree that this place isn't all that good. I felt like I could make Thai food at home much better.

This place is great! They started accepting cards about 1 year ago.  The seats are terrible though in the sense that they're too small. Or maybe I'm too big.  Good deal. I've been here plenty of times.

We were thinking of going to Garcia's at Arizona Mills Mall and decided to go here instead. It wasn't a big mistake but would have been more satisfied at Garcia's.  The table we were sat at was too close to other tables for that "intimate" feel. Our server was great, however. The food wasn't all that good. They bring you chips and salsa. The salsa, in my opinion wasn't that great.  Most likely won't be coming back as there are better options out there.

We moved to this area a little over 1 month ago and have been exploring our options. We wound up in this area and decided to try this out.  When entering the hostess lady looked incredibly bored and without a word guided us to our table, where she whispered that our server will be by shortly. About 5 minutes later the server came by and took our drink order, he came back with our drinks then disappeared for what seemed like 10-15 minutes. In that time we had been ready to order so what the heck?? And we were perhaps 1 of 5 other groups in here so it wasn't busy.  I had ordered spicy tuna and hot and sour soup. Who I was with order a steak with tempura and fried rice. One good thing about here is that if someone you're with doesn't like Asian style food then things like steak are available (this wasn't hibachi or anything, it was just a regular steak...although it was mentioned that it had a spice that couldn't be determined).  The spicy tuna roll wasn't all that great. I've been to less impressive looking places and have had amazing spicy tuna rolls for less. It was like they weren't really trying. The hot and sour soup was ok but overloaded with carrots. I tasted the steak it was decent.  It took a long time to get a refill on our drinks.  It took even longer for them to come by and hand us the check.  Have fun waiting if you go!

I went here on a Sunday with my SO. I first got up there and loaded up sushi, rice noodles, some chicken, mushrooms, and a bowl of hot and sour soup. The soup was very bland. I had been very excited about this prospect because someone in an earlier review said it was awesome. It was more watery than anything. The sushi was actually bad. I remembered picking it up and it was dripping with liquid (the sashimi).  They have a sign that says something to the effect that if you don't finish your plate you'll be charged 20% more. This isn't right since half their stuff is flavorless (the stuff we had).  $30 for two people on Sunday for lunch at this place was not worth it. We'll stick with Osaka, pay $20 more, for great food and service.

Been here a few times and have always been "off put" by the place. I called in for a pickup and the lady taking the order sounded very annoyed. After hanging up I venture over there and the same lady didn't acknowledge me at first. I went to pay, and just as she swiped my card another customer came in asking a question about the food, something like is it too salty. The lady was clearly annoyed again and would answer with condescending logic like 'well if you order something salty then it will be salty.'  While I was waiting to pay earlier I can see the cook(s) in the back on the phone while cooking. The kitchen doesn't look very clean at all.  An earlier time I had been in there, their soda machine wasn't working and only had water in a water jug available...which was out. There weren't any drinks on there. I should've left as I was dine in that time.  Another time I was dine in, I guess the owner and his/her family decided to eat on the center table, which is cool I wouldn't care but they were staring at my wife and I the whole time (and we stared back).  And still another time we ordered delivery. I put the tip in the order online. The kid shows up and demands a tip. He takes out his phone to call the place to make sure I had put the tip in then maybe realizes he's being rude and just walks away.  Pretty sure I'm done with this place. And it would make me a happy man if I can even dissuade one other person from going there.

The chicken I got here had a hint of what seemed to me of burnt plastic. I couldn't quite figure it out. The vegetables I got (rather than rice and/or noodles) didn't seem to be cooked correctly like at other Panda Express locations.   Service was good, everything went smoothly there.

We arrived here around 5:00 pm on a Friday for dinner. At that time there weren't very many people in there. We were sat down immediately and ordered our drinks. It seemed a bit longer than usual for the server to come back and take our dinner orders, but I brushed it off. I had seen the reviews of how bad the service is, so I thought I was thinking too much about it.  Our food did come but it was brought to us by a manager I believe. Our waitress had disappeared! About 20 minutes later she starts serving another table, so certainly she was still working at that time. A lady who worked as a bus lady I think, she would come by and see if we were done. We had to ask her to get our check.   I had ordered the all-you-can-eat fish, but only got one plate. I sat and sat and sat waiting for our waitress to come back but she never did, so I decided I was done. Its not amazing either...its fish. My fiance's steak was great, however she mentioned her potato was overwhelmed with sour cream and bacon bits and her green beans were gross. We never once had a refill on our drinks.  While sitting there in the beginning, we had visions of coming here more often as a 'date night'. But we quickly learned that we'll be taking our money elsewhere. Very disappointing.   When we left we complained but all we got was 'sorry :( '. I'm avoiding this place at all costs unless its to order steak to go; the steak was the only saving grace of this place.

Let me say first that I love Chinese food and its hard to not impress me. With that said, this place was gross.  I came in at lunch around 11:00am and was the only person in there. Their lunch menu has a lot but its strange: you get the main food, then you have to choose between a drink OR an egg roll OR a soup. Other places its usually all three for the lunch menu.   I ordered shrimp with garlic sauce and a large hot and sour soup because that's what I really came for and I can seriously put away Chinese food. It took what seemed like at least 10 minutes so I'm starting to think that it will come out fresh and incredible. You can see where they're cooking...looks like they're hard at work back there.  The person who took my order at the register brings the soup first then the plate of food. I hadn't noticed until I got the food but they have buckets of silverware on the table. I wasn't sure if they were used or not, but they looked used. However there were so many on each table that certainly they all couldn't have been used. I was also kind of taken aback that they serve on styrofoam plates. No big deal just that I hadn't seen that in a long time.  I start eating the shrimp with garlic sauce. I quickly find that I don't detect any garcle whatsoever. Maybe because I love garlic and they only put enough in for a normal person. I don't know. I also soon find that it tastes like one of those microwaveable Chinese meals I could have gotten at the store a couple hundred feet away from their frozen section. Ah well, I eat it all anyway.  I get to the hot and sour soup: again, what I had really come for because I had been craving it for some time and has become my measuring stick for Chinese places. First slurp: no flavor. Nothing. Ok? I put some soy sauce. Kind of better. So I'm eating it, watching a little of their TV as I go when I noticed something strange. I don't know if it was uncooked egg or some sort of gellatanous goup but there was some clear junk in the soup. I already paid for it and I got the impression they wouldn't care if I told them, so I scoup it out and put on my plate. I continue eating the soup and find more and more. And what I think was chicken in there starts to resemble children's fingers that may have slipped in. This is no bueno!  Another thing. Their drinks. They give you a styrofoam cup to fill yourself which is cool, but they don't have a lid for that size. Makes me think they purposefully did this so you wouldn't take any drink with you.  I work around here and this could have been my go to place but I won't ever be coming back. It makes my stomach feel weird just thinking about what I ate. I hope I don't get sick later on.  Yes, it could have been a bad day for them. It was Friday maybe they were all excited, I don't know. But I'm not going to chance it.

Like earlier reviewers, I needed a new water heater because of a leak that started (I think) about a couple days before posting this. I didn't know it, but was real bad and I'm lucky it didn't get any worse than it already was. Water had started to leak from the top and the bottom, and at the top it was getting into the electrical. Like I said, I didn't know the complete details of the leak until Jim arrived. I called today (Sunday) and initially it went straight to voicemail. After leaving a message, Jim called back immediately. After briefly discussing a few things, he said he'll be over in an hour or so and requested I send some pictures so he could confirm the type of water heater he needed to bring. Once he got here (around noon), he replaced the tank quicker than I ever could have if I dared try and efficiently as possible. He was very professional and courteous, even thanking me for my time when it was really me who should be thanking him. Per his website and him talking about it, he quoted me at $640 and didn't try to up charge or what have you.  I did have an issue with my card(s) being declined. We finally figured it out but he was calm and collected, while I was getting very worried. Thankfully everything worked out.  Upon leaving Jim explained some things about the water heater and how one generally doesn't have to worry about them for a certain length of time. He gave me the number of the warranty person should something ever come up. It was great doing business with Jim and his company. I'll definitely be recommending them if such work needs to be done with anyone I know.

The service here on 5/25/14 was bad. The guy seemed to only focus on me (another guy) and not my fiance. Instead of asking if we wanted more to drink he'd just come and grab our cups.  The chips and salsa, in my opinion, are terrible. The beans are ok.  We didn't like the food at all. Will not be coming back.

Hired Moxie Girl to clean the house I moved out of. They were great! They took care of everything I asked them for and was very satisfied with the results. One of the two girls did mess up the shower door by taking it off its track and leaving it for some reason, but no big deal I fixed it.  If ever I need to have a cleaning company come, I'll be giving them a call.

Found these guys through Yelp (and a Reddit subreddit /r/Phoenix). As soon as I pulled up they were ready to work on my car. I was there for an oil change and they diagnosed a few other issues along the way. It was a little under $30 for my car. This was the day after Christmas 2015.

This place wasn't very good. I see it all the time when I go to the movies next door so I thought for once I'll try it out.   It got off to a bad start when my fiance went to the restroom and said it was the worst one she had been in in a restaurant.  She ordered the chicken teriyake and it wasn't very good, it was lukewarm. I had intended to order sushi but I saw no sushi bar and there were no pictures that seemed to match what other people were having, so I went with something else. The service wasn't spectacular. The one and only guy in there yelled across the restaurant to see if we were ok more than once.  I'll not be coming back. There are better options out there.

These guys are great. You can't go wrong with the services they provide. We were broken into in October 2013 and finally decided to get home security. We looked at other companies and honestly came pretty close to signing up with national companies like ADT. I looked one more time and found these guys. I think their youtube video convinced me more than anything.  I called them up and they came by the next day to get things going. If anything it gives you a peace of mind. The sensors accidentally detect when, say, a glass pan breaks so that should tell you how sensitive they are. Customer service is great. Compared to other companies they really are a huge deal for what you get.

Been here twice, once for dinner and once for lunch. Dinner was at the teppan which was great! I was with a large group (8 people total) and we were taken care of very well.  The lunch another time was similar. For that we sat at the regular tables by choice. Just gotta note that the host guy for that day was very strange as he kept hovering around and staring at people as they ate. This was on a Saturday around 2.

Kind of like a Goodwill store but not. We came in and felt depressed being here. They have sales each day, such as one on Monday for specific items then something different on Tuesday. I didn't notice a smell that others have mentioned.   I wound up going to the restroom. The men's stall's door lock is broken so after a few minutes of trying to get it catch and stay shut I gave up and sat down to do business. It was then that a noticed the rest of the restroom reminded me of the first Saw movie...without the excrement all over, without anybody in there, without the bright lights, etc. Just had that feeling. The impending doom of someone walking in when the lock to the stall was broken had me on high alert so I got out of there as soon as I could, but first had to wash my hands...only to find a lack of paper towels.   I came back out and my fiance, who is into finding clothes at Goodwill Saturday sales, wanted to get out of there fast. This place was just sad. If you've ever seen Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion it definitely reminded me of when one of the girls went to try and find a job at that thrift store (the one where a lady walked by looking at shoes, and where a baby was crying).

These guys were great! We called about 3 weeks ahead of time to arrange a time for them to come out: a Thursday starting at 8:00 AM. We got mostly everything ready by boxing up things and trying to position them to be moved rapidly. The prior year we had moved ourselves in the July heat of Arizona and were thinking heck no, we'll be hiring someone this time around.  Calling into the company was ok. The ladies who answered would always say they had to go and make sure whatever requests or changes to schedule were ok with the manager.   The day of, we were waiting in the kitchen for them to show up. We didn't wait long, I think they arrived about 5 minutes before they were supposed to. I was a little nervous at first because there were only two of them, and one of them was looking in our recycle bin outside. I assume that was because he wanted to make sure if anything needed to be thrown away it could be done...or maybe it was in the way of their potential route for getting things in the truck so if it was empty it could be moved.  Once inside they introduced themselves, I showed them around at what would go..what would need special attention, etc. After that, I was to sign the contract guaranteeing I wouldn't do anything if something was broken beforehand and not blame them. They then got to work. Over the course of the time they loaded I would get nervous that they would fall behind on time. In reality, if I was doing this it would take several hours upon hours. They never stalled on time, but what might have appeared to be stalling time was actually them playing it smart and loading the smart way rather than throwing things in the truck and hoping for the best.  They treated everything as though it were breakable. They had methods of securing furniture, boxes, etc. so they wouldn't result in getting destroyed. They have all the equipment necessary to move things (dolly, ramp to/from entry way, etc.   The two guys who came out were very friendly and we would crack jokes, tell stories in passing, etc. It made the whole experience much better than having someone come in and get in and get out...strictly business. Not these guys. They were professional but also likable, if only I could call 'em up every time I needed to move something and ask them to do it.  Unloading was the same. They handled everything with care. We got them lunch because it was starting to be a long day. We made sure they had something to drink. Surprisingly they didn't look like they were even sweating. I don't know if its because they're used to moving stuff or what. Minimal breaks, etc. A great experience.  Yelp has/had a coupon for a certain amount off. A couple days before the move I still hadn't purchased it so the lady at the office called me and asked if I was still interested in it. I thought that was cool of them to do.  A couple times I even left them at the house to run a couple errands and returned to them still at work. It wasn't like they had taken a break or anything. Great in my opinion  I don't plan on moving again but will always recommend you guys.  I'm writing this on the same day that we moved. If this were me alone I'd still be loading from 8:00 AM and would probably spend a chunk of the next day unloading. Instead these guys loaded and unloaded in the space of 6 hours (when considering eating, breaks, driving between places, etc.). It wasn't expensive like other moving companies in the Phoenix metro area.  We had intended to tip them too. I overheard one of them joking about the first tip of the day when he picked up a penny from the floor. Sorry fellas, we had the money to tip you both but it slipped our minds when it was all done.  Another awesome thing was that I was loading my own car with some things I didn't think should go in the truck (TV, etc.). One of them rushed over to help me so that I had enough room in there. That was cool.

These guys are great!  It was a Friday night and we noticed our A/C wasn't doing its thing properly. We searched around: the first company said to call them back in the morning. That wasn't an option. The second company said they would call us back but didn't after 15 minutes. This wasn't acceptable to us, though I guess we could sympathize as a customer since it was almost 9 at night.  We found Arizona Dukes of Air and they came out ASAP. Turns out the owner himself arrived, which we thought was incredible. He was very personable and explained everything thoroughly, even had a laugh about the status of our duct work. Things are not good in this area of our house and if it wasn't for Arizona Dukes of Air we may not have found out until much too late.  He got everything fixed and the cost was maybe 1/4 of what a major company would have charged. As he was leaving he mentioned he could help us out with contacting the home warranty people. The whole experience could have been much worse, but we found that Arizona Dukes handled everything very well.  They're now our go-to company and will always recommend them.

I also gotta add that John came out late that night and mentioned he had an appointment with another customer at 6 the next morning. He sacrificed his time with his family and his sanity (we all need sleep after a long day) to make sure we were taken care of. He was concerned that we wouldn't have a working A/C for that night and just got it done.  Also, I'm not a veteran, but like him I respect them. He mentioned that on Memorial Day he offered discounted services to veterans. John and everyone at Arizona's Dukes of Air are simply amazing.

This place is located at the business school on the ASU campus. Because of classes at night and no other options except a few things at the MU at night when I had classes, this was the place to be. You can choose from burritos, salads, wraps, and bowls. Somehow each time I wound up spending at least $9-$10.  The food looks great but when you eat it, most of the options leave more to be desired. What would otherwise sound like an amazing meal, like a Thai Lemon Grass Burrito, always had me wondering where the lemon flavor was. It was aspects like that that left me give a 4 star review.  The people running the place don't seem too bad. I always caught them between 6-9 at night so maybe that has a factor to play. Every time I walk in they're welcoming, smiling, and ready to take my order. They make their food right there in front of you. You might not be able to pick and choose what you want on everything but you can substitute components, etc.  Some of these reviews are funny because they clearly show that people weren't paying attention to what they ordered and the ability to see exactly what they're doing to make your order (think of it like how you can see what they're doing at Subway). And every single restaurant is unsustainable in some way. They wrap your meal up in paper if you get a burrito or wrap, only for you to toss it away later...who's unsustainable then? I guess some of these reviews are freshman in their 101 classes who are out to change the world.

This place is cheap as all get out. The server we had was great! I didn't particularly care for the food but its cheap and has a home town feeling.

This is a review for the new place, since it is no longer Sunny World.  The food was just ok, what really makes this such a poor rating is the service. When I went, there weren't that many people sitting down but I had to wait 15 minutes to be seated. The waiters would look over and it would appear they were apprehensive to seat more people. When I finally was seated, I overheard people complaining about the same issue. One group of people experienced it too and seated themselves.  We came for dinner. I don't remember much about the menu but it came with soup. What is supposed to be an appetizer (the soup) took 20 minutes! And the drinks even longer. I don't know what the heck is wrong with these people but they really weren't that busy to warrant such slow service. As I said earlier, the food was just ok. In my opinion you'd get better tasting Chinese food from Panda Express.

I had a similar experience that Amanda F. had. The first time I came here it was decent, i would have given this place 5 stars if it were like the first time each time. I had previously gone to the Tempe location and noted that this place seemed much more clean and organized. For your first time, or your return after being absent for a long time like myself, you go through the orientation which can take 3+ hours. After that, and a sort of physical (asking questions and blood test) they then start the actual process. The first time here was odd because they had to stick me twice. They said I needed to drink more water the next time I come in, must have been some dehydration issue. But eventually everything worked it...for this first time.  I came back the following weekend and was one of the first several people there. This time, they stuck me and messed up. They did it completely wrong because when it started returning blood it wasn't going into the right place but forming a "bubble" of blood in my arm! I had to holler out for them to take care of the issue. They then tried sticking me again but "missed", and started to basically try again and again like they were using my arm for practice. It was like they were guessing where my veins were and just poking in hoping to hit something. They quit once they noticed I wasn't liking this and had me lay down with some water and not return for a couple months. I haven't been back and don't ever intend to.  This place has given me a fear of needles that I never had before. Just a couple people know what they're doing. They all seem to be fresh out of school or something. Stay away!

This particular location is terrible. I ordered a pizza, sandwich, and fries. Their website says it will take 1 hour for it to get here. I could've ordered twice from Pizza Hut/Dominos twice...maybe three times...and those orders would get here before that hour was up. You don't get any estimate on time prior to finalizing your order. The 1 hour came and went. I called and they said something to the effect that everything was being placed in the delivery driver's car and will be there soon. Another 30 minutes goes by. I call in and want to cancel and this time get someone else who was very rude and sounded like she couldn't wait to hang up. She said the delivery driver is on his way. Great! I should expect it pretty soon right?  ANOTHER HOUR?!  Once it gets here the delivery driver isn't apologetic at all. In fact, he's looking at me as though I inconvenienced him. By this time its way too late to eat a decent meal with the family. I sit down to contemplate wtf just happened, open the box of pizza and realize its cold. No heat at all. Nothing. They probably had the pizza ready hours ago and had it sitting around waiting to be delivered when the driver felt like it, or had more orders waiting to be delivered so they could maximize his time delivering a bunch of orders. I checked the fries. Cold.  I went to Facebook and found out that many people have had the same exact problem, even worse with burnt/inedible food, ordering in person and it takes forever, etc. I came here to Yelp and found the same stories. I do not understand how this location has remained in business with its terrible customer service and horrible time-management. It is a very poor example of what Geno's is, because other locations throughout the Valley are the exact opposite.

Unfortunately our food came out cold and they didn't have time to fix it I guess. There are some good options for their food but nothing really seemed appetizing to begin with.

This place is just ok I suppose. I've made healthier and more tasty salads on my own.   But each time I've gone through their drive thru, the lady that's there takes my card and gives me the weirdest look, like she's offended.

This place is amazing. Wife and I have been here a few times and each time have been treated like we were best friends of the owners. Everything here is pretty good.

I tried them and they're nothing special. The pho came with none of the stuff it usually comes with from other places.
