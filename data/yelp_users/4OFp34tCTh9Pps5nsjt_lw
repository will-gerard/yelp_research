Best food ever!!!  Just need tacos back.  I have been eating here since 1982 and have been a loyal customer ever since.  Best beans and green chili in town!

Shame on me for not having known about this wonderful little gem.  We tried to have lunch on a Monday and the place was packed.  Too bad we were in a hurry or we would have stayed.  So on friday I stopped in later in the afternoon.  The place was quiet and the young gal behind the counter was sweet and helpful.  I ordered a sandwich and german potato salad to go and am very pleased.  The sandwich was a good size, not to big and the potato salad was solid.  I love a small local business and they do not disappoint.

Terrible service!!!!  Food was ok, but don't think we will be back.  They left a empty dirty salad bowl on our table for more than half an hour, gross!  Many servers and managers walked by with no notice of dirty dishes on tables,  we had to box up our own food,  and at no time did anyone offer me a second glass of wine!  Fail!!!  They also sat two well dressed adults in the kiddie section, really?!?!  It was not busy, early in the evening, and a full staff.  There is no excuse for such terrible service!  I wish I had  read the other reviews before we ate here.   After all these bad reviews you would think their corporate would get a clue or they just don't care either!   Lazy and apathetic is no way to go through life.

A great Scottsdale staple!  Good bar staff and fun music.  Mike the bartender is my favorite.  Also a place to take visitors.  And a favorite spring training stop.

Cathee has been doing my hair for 5 years now.  I love her and the salon.  I finally got up the nerve for a blow-out and LOVE it.  My hair is soft and takes no time at all to look awesome.  I wouldn't let anyone else do my hair.

I ordered take out and watched my food sit in the window ignored.  While people who arrived after me eat.   Hhhmmmm, this is not cool.  Kinda wish I could take my tip back.

WARNING!! WARNING!!  ALL PARENTS BEWARE!!   I should have know it was going to be BAD with the vacant look in Jasmines eyes.  I guess asking for honey with my oatmeal was more than she could handle.  Our 7 year old (yes seven year old boy) ordered a hot chocolate and she verified to temp it for a child.   After receiving our order he complained it didn't taste like hot chocolate.  We both tasted the said hot chocolate and found it to be coffee with mocha added.  WHAT ADULT give coffee to a 7 year old that ordered hot chocolate!!  It took it up to the barista and was told yes it was coffee with mocha as ordered?!?  I informed her that we had in fact ordered hot chocolate!  She was the only one working there that seemed to care about this mistake.   Then Alissa comes into the picture and offered to remake the drink as she rolled her eyes at me.  I explained we were leaving and to just refund our money.   She didn't seem to be happy with this option.   So rather than refund our money promptly she made two more drinks.  I asked for a number and contact person for this Starbucks location and she explained she was busy and it was going to take her a while.   I explained that the longer it took her to get me the information, the more I would complain.  Well here I am starting my complaining!!!  And this is just the start Alissa!   I am not sorry to interrupt your busy morning with my complaints!  And at no time did she apologize for such an error!  Seriously!! Who thinks it's ok to give coffee to a child!! FAIL!!!!    I wish Yelp would allow negative stars for rating!  And when I asked for a corporate number for Starbucks she took over 5 minutes.  At this point I just left and decided to do it my way.

This has become our sunday morning go to breakfast joint.  Yes, there is a Denny's, Waffle House, and Cracker Barrel across the street.   I like the staff and would rather give my money to a local business.  Keep it up Times Square!!!  And they do a nice take-out when you are not up for the crowd and chatter.  A great family place.

Best short ribs!!! Nice wine selection, so that is a big plus for me.  I have broken up with Chelsea's Kitchen for Beckett's Table.

It was not bad, it was not great.  The staff needs to be trained, he took our order (which he did not write down) and then came back to get our order again?

Didn't hate it, didn't love it.  And they served me a desert they knew was bad.  If you know its bad don't serve it, very simple.  Upside is they have cucumber vodka.

After picking up a little wine at Bevmo I thought I would treat myself to a little take out from Pita Jungle.  I usually pick up togo from their Arcadia location and have never been let down, I have also had 1 good togo experience from this Norterra location.   Today, not so great.  I went to the bar to order and had to wait as the bartender was busy flirting with some gal at the bar.  I ordered my regular favorite item, Lentil Fatoush salad.   My food was brought out quickly and set in the bar area, the bartender watched him put the bag down but kept up with a conversation with a co-worker.  I finally got up went to get my food myself, so rudely interrupting their conversation, to make sure it was my order.  I guess I have that entitled attitude as a paying and tipping customer.  I was still excited about eating my favorite salad, only to get home and find out they made me a Rice Fatoush salad.  Usually it is mostly lentils with some rice, this time is was 90% rice with a few lentils mixed in with way more garlic than needed.  Sad face for me.

I had lunch today at the bar with a friend and found the service was the best we have ever had at any Pita Jungle in town.  I believer her name was Jennifer, she was attentive and engaging with all of her customers.  She could be a good trainer for all of their servers.

Two stars for a nice interior and the manager offering to comp our lunch.  However, I was not looking for a free lunch.  I was excited to have an opportunity to eat lunch here as I am usually serving lunch myself.  We showed up after 12:30 and it was still a little busy.  We waited about 10 minutes for a table as I didn't feel like eating lunch at the bar, bad choice.  After 2 different people brought us water and chips our waitress finally made an appearance.  I had the taco plate with a free side and he had a steak burrito with a free side.  My meal came out pretty quick however his meal came out 7 minutes later.  My free side turned out to be ice cold rice and his free side never arrived.  It's not really a free side if you don't bring the said side.  Our food delivery and drink refills were done by other servers.  At no point did our waitress or any other server ask how our meal was or if we needed anything, isn't that server 101?!? Check on your tables.  My boyfriend had to leave and get back to work as it was taking a long time and could not foresee when our server would reappear.  When she finally decided to check on me and brought the bill she apologized for the confusion?  What confusion?!  She told us she would be our server so I expect she will be serving us, not everyone else.  She just flat out IGNORED us!  When she knew I was not pleased she got short with me.  Probably not how you should treat a displeased customer.    Whitney, dear this business is not for you and stop putting blame elsewhere.    I'm not sure I will be back for lunch.  Maybe when it cools off the patio would be a nice experience.  And the food, pretty good but not worth the bad service.  Also, the manager should be managing his staff not tending the bar at lunch time.
