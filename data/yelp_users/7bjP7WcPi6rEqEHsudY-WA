In a desert state, finding sushi this fresh is an exciting surprise. Finding it just around the corner from my house makes it that much better, though that second part is really just for my wife and I.  Shimogamo was impressive. Fun atmosphere, intimate setting, friendly staff, and above all incredible food.  It was amazing the difference in quality between this place and our regular sushi spots; we are very happy to have a new place to go when the sushi craving strikes.   Will definitely be going back... a lot.

Generic, flavorless food. Don't let the open kitchen fool you; this is Panda Express without the cafeteria style line. Disappointed and won't be returning.

Teakwoods is part of our regular rotation. Sometimes, you just want some bar food, and few places I've been to serve it up as well as they do here.  Whether it's wings, a burger or my wife's favorite buffalo chicken sandwich, we've been consistently able to count on a quality meal from this place.  Even though we generally get our orders to go, we have made the time on occasion to dine in and have always been happy with the atmosphere and service.   This is your neighborhood bar, not some place that the socialites frequent as part of their weekend bar hopping routine and that is just fine with me. There are plenty of other places to go if you're more interested in the crowd than the bar.   Teakwoods is the place to go when you want something cold on tap, peanuts on the floor, some good wings and an hour or two just hanging out with good friends.

Having left my packed lunch safely in the fridge at home (an event that happens far more often than I'd like to admit) I set off to try something new for lunch today. Fiesta Burrito was a great choice; thank you yelp!  I ordered the machaca plate, no. 11. A generous helping of machaca with egg, onions, peppers, cheese, and rice and beans on the side. A flour tortilla to scoop it all up with, some fresh pico de gallo and salsa verde from the salsa bar and I was set for a great lunch.  The food was great and inexpensive. The service was friendly and the location was very clean.   They have a big menu with several combination plates, all with rice and beans, breakfast food served all day, and some great a la carte options if you don't want the full meal.  Compared to other drive-through/quick order Mexican food places around, my meal here was comparable to Carolina's. That's the highest praise I can think to give a place like this.  I'll definitely be back.

Just returned from lunch here and am quite satisfied.   The food is good, but not overwhelmingly so. It's on the upper end of what you'd expect bar food to be. I had the mushroom swiss burger. It may not have blown me away, but it was definitely delicious. I recommend it.  The service at the bar was great, very attentive and the atmosphere is great. Laid back. Come in, have a drink, a bite to eat and just relax for a few.  The big draw to Four Peaks is they're home brews. I'd say they are a brewery fist and a bar second and I wouldn't want it any other way.  Try the Oatmeal Stout. Thanks to Austin for recommending it.

Rosita's was a real disappointment. I was craving a hard shell taco with rice and beans for lunch and gave Rosita's a shot at satisfying my hunger. I chose wrong.  The chips and salsa were okay, not great. The salsa was a pretty watered down and didn't have a lot of flavor. The chips were warm, like they promise, but tasted like they'd been sitting under the warmer a little too long.  I went with the burrito and taco lunch special; everything I was craving. I chose a chicken burrito and machaca taco. It was sorely disappointing. The taco was okay, but didn't have a lot of flavor; the burrito was horrible.   A thick, store-bought quality flour tortilla filled with flavorless, boiled chicken and absolutely nothing else. I had to cut open the tortilla and douse the atrocity that lay inside with the remaining rice and beans on my plate and a large helping of salsa just to make this thing palatable.  Whether Mexican, Italian, Thai or American, really good food is all about flavor. Unfortunately, Rosita's had none to offer.

Given the number of trips I've made to Cartel Coffee Lab, it's a little embarrassing to admit that I didn't know Otto's even existed before yesterday.  Thanks to my good friend Austin, however, I not only know where this place is, but had a decent meal out of the experience too.  Otto's pizza is good. Big slices, decent quality toppings and all served hot. I didn't see anything sitting under a warming lamp.  The slice and drink deals are great. Two big, fresh slices and and a soda was $5 and some change.   I'm certain to venture Otto's again; they have a big menu to select from and I'm looking forward to trying out their other offerings.  Bottom line, Otto's won't blow you away, but it will satisfy your hunger and will be a place you want to return to.

If you're a Tempe/Mesa native or an ASU student or alum, then you probably know Haji-Baba. I, however, am neither and only recently discovered this awesome place by way of a recommendation on Twitter.  Since then, I've been there five times and have tried nearly everything on the menu. The food is delicious! Seriously, there hasn't been one thing I've tried that I haven't enjoyed.  On my first trip, I ordered the combination. I highly recommend doing this if you've never eaten here before. This plate gives you a great sampling of what their menu has to offer and a generous portion at that. It's easily enough for two people and, at only around $12, a great deal too.  On my most recent visit, I had the Gyro plate; again amazing! A very generous portion served with a delicious salad, a side of rice, and I topped the meal off with an Arabic coffee.  Haji-Baba is not really a secret and the place will get very busy at lunch time. If you want to eat there, go for an early or late lunch, otherwise you'll have to wait for a table; it's worth it!  They have a large menu and great prices, and if you don't have time to stay and eat, you can order to-go from the counter.  The staff do a good job, but their food is so good, I'd still eat there if a server punched me in the face every time I walked in the door.  If you haven't tried it, you need to go there. If you have, then you know just how great Haji-Baba is.

Ventured here for lunch  today with my good friend Austin. Another successful lunch!   The Chuck Box knows exactly who their customers are, exactly what they offer and they execute with precision. Charcoal grilled burgers, fries or onion rings and a condiment bar with the essentials to finish off your meal how you like it. A home bbq weekend when ever you're in the mood.  It's simple, it's effective and above all, it's good.  Their cash only policy is a minor annoyance that you quickly forget after sinking your teeth into the fresh-off-the-grill meal.

This is my favorite Thai place in the Phoenix valley. Never had a bad experience here.  Every dish I've tried has been great,  the prices are reasonable and the portions are generous. I always have leftovers to take home.  My recommendations are the Mussaman curry, the Phad Thai and wash it all down with a Thai tea. For desert? The mango sticky rice.  I think I'm going to have to go here for lunch today.

So many things are done right at this great little shop. The atmosphere is inviting, the baked goods are amazing and their meals are delicious. The sad irony about The Coffee Shop is they do everything right except for the coffee. It's awful and has been consistently awful through all my visits.  There is a marked difference between a cup from Liberty Market, one of Joe's other fantastic ventures, and The Coffee Shop and I don't understand why.  Don't get me wrong though, The Coffee Shop is really more of an experience or an ideal. They've done a fantastic job creating an environment that is comfortable, relaxing and fun. The kind of place where you can hang out with a group of friends and never notice the hours slip by. It's the neighborhood coffee shop we all wish we had around the corner.  The amazing quality of the baked goods far outweighs the lack of quality coffee. The red velvet cupcake is a masterpiece and the homemade scones are outstanding.  The food and the atmosphere are the reasons I like this place. If they started serving Cartel coffee, The Coffee Shop could become nirvana.

We've been driving past this place ever since moving and it was time to finally stop in and find out what a place called "Spicy Pickle" actually serves.  Turns out it's subs, paninis, salads and little pizza-esque creations and the verdict is this is some tasty stuff. The italian panini was great. Very flavorful and a decent sized portion.  It's good to have one more place close to home that I know I'll be happy with. Looking forward to trying out some of the other menu options.

I've been to La's Thai a few times, since I work within walking distance, and haven't been disappointed with anything I've tried. They have a large menu with good lunch specials, friendly staff, and the food is good.  My benchmark for a good Thai place is Massaman Curry and La's version is excellent. If you like peanut sauces, this is a definite must try. The Thai iced tea is delicious as well.  It can get pretty busy around lunch time, but I've never had to wait too long for a meal. The dining area fits more people than you'd expect and manages to still feel like there's enough room.  I'm working on getting some co-workers to try it out next time I go; one can only handle so much cafeteria food.

I'll admit upfront that my review is probably a little biased simply due to the excitement of discovering a newly opened bar and grill practically in my back yard.   That being said, it was great to go to lunch today and discover that Lucky Lou's is good! Very good!  If you're from the East Valley, you may already be familiar with Lucky Lou's, this was my first experience though and I am excited to have such a good place near by.  The first thing to hit me walking was the layout and decor. Usually, I'm not the kind of person who really cares one way or another. As long as the place is clean, I'm good. With Lou's though, I was really impressed with the fun atmosphere, theme and design. The bar has a glass top, with different gambling table mats arranged underneath, complete with cards and chips. It's a great touch.  The food was good too. They're on the lower end of the $$ scale. A burger and Guiness cost me about $14. I don't recall seeing anything on the menu more than $15 or $17, but I did notice that everything was offered in a generous portion.  The service was fantastic. Attentive and friendly staff complimented by the manager who gave me a basket of fries on the house to go with my burger and side of pasta salad.  They have happy hour M - F from 3 -6 and Sat,Sun from 12 - 6. In addition, they have $3 drink specials from 9 - close.   I'm sure my excitement has come through clearly for Lucky Lou's. Not just because it's close, but it's a fun atmosphere with good food and good service. Looking forward to many more visits in the future.

If you've been to My Big Fat Greek Restaurant, you know what to expect from the food here; the menu is essentially the same. In stead of talking about the quality of the food, which is good, there are a couple of things that you need to know about this incarnation of the chain.  1. While the offerings on the menu are pretty much the same, the prices at Express are less expensive. That doesn't mean you're missing out on portion size though; you get the same helping as you will at the restaurant.   The Express menu doesn't offer some of the big ticket items such as steak, shrimp or the pizzas.  2. Full bar and happy hour specials all day/night. $3 wells, $3 Sky, $5 Sangria and more. Their happy hour specials are generous and run throughout their working hours.   The place itself is nice. Lots of outdoor seating and a good space inside. The bar is small, only 5 or 6 seats, but is well stocked.   The bar tender said that lunch time gets pretty crowded with all the businesses in the neighborhood, so if you're going for lunch, plan accordingly.
