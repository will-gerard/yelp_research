Staff was very cold and didn't seem to want to help. I went in to fax 13 pages and had to ask for help instead of being offered any assistance. Fax machine was super slow so I tried to pay and ask how much it would be but the girl working told me to wait until the print confirmation paper printed. She proceeded to tell me it was going to cost be over $21 to fax 13 pages of paper. I was super upset she did not tell me this until all pages went through. I definitely would have went somewhere else like a public library. Unacceptable service and fees and will definitely not ever be coming back!

I have had a great relationship with Mastro's and sent them many many customers as a concierge.  When people looked for fancy and/or great steakhouse I would send them over and they always loved it.  I personally like the place and I'm reviewing and rating based off of one main key thin - the steak that I ordered. (But I will touch up on other parts about my visit)  So the steak was good but it just was not great for me which anyone would expect paying such a high price.  I got the rib-eye and it was a bit too dry for a rib-eye and it did not have the flavor I was hoping for.  Most of the flavoring seemed to come from them buttering it up so much rather than a rich grilled taste I was hoping for. So with that said I personally would simply rather go to Texas RoadHouse for their bone in Rib-Eye for half the cost for the taste that I enjoy.    The sides.  Mashed potatoes and asparagus for me.  The asparagus was very buttered up too and not cooked enough to my liking but I can't really blame them because I liked my asparagus burnt and I did not specify cooking instructions.  The mashed potatoes was also very buttery like everything else my brother and I ordered.  I do like my mashed potatoes buttery and rich so I actually really liked it.  The side portions are pretty huge and can easily be shared.    For dinner we were offered their famous popular butter cake.  This thing was huge and just too much for the two of us but guess what...we ended up finishing the whole thing.  It was delicious and probably addicting is the best way to describe it.    Few other things worth mentioning besides food before I opted out.  There is valet service and the service is good.  The interior is fancy as one would expect and it is more on the quite and dark ambiance.  The middle sections closer to the bar in a bit more bright and lively feeling.  All in all, this restaurant is a great treat for a special night with friends and family and they are very good at accommodating special needs (sent over many many wealthy and high profile guest)  I'm just mainly disappointed with my steak option and perhaps maybe in the future I need to try different options or re-try my rib-eye option. Until that day may come, I'm leaving this as a four star restaurant.

I went on a jet ski tour a while back. The owners set me up to go with one of their tour guides. I met up with Steve at Lake Pleasant on an early morning and we got lucky and the lake was not so busy. It was actually my very first time on a jet ski and I had a blast from the beginning. Steve went over safety and rules and tips and before you know it we were off riding along side. Steve was very knowledgeable for the area and about the lake and rock formations a well and about the history of the place. He took us up to a no motor zone where we shut off the engines and went for a quick swim and the water felt amazing and surprisingly warm as I was expecting it to be a lot colder. We also got some extra time to just have fun riding around on our own and having fun. I had a blast and I would highly recommend anyone to go on a tour with Arizona Outdoor Fun.  It's that time of the seasons where Arizona is super busy and all the snow birds are in town. I use to be a full time concierge and now I'm doing online concierging and reviews and making travel videos on my off time. I'm familiar with Arizona and many of the big adventure companies and have tried many things and Arizona Out door Fun is one of the best tour companies and probably the biggest variety offering company I came across in my years of being a concierge.

I have not been in for a little while but while I use to live by it I would go in once in a while.  For around $10 you can get a lot of food!  The variety is awesome and you get to pick quite a bit of it for your bowl (if you are a type of person that does not like different foods touching each other, I would not recommend it)  I love how many different flavors of hummus they have available as well and I like most of them.  Eddie I believe one of the owners is a really friendly guy and helps you make decisions and let's you try out whatever you want. I'm definitely due in for a lunch at Hummus Xpress in the very near future and I hope you get to go try it too.

This is my favorite all time Indian Cuisine Restaurant I go to and in fact one of my top favorite food places in general. I always go for the lunch buffet and have been going here for 2+ years now.  The variety is very good and sometimes they switch it up but for the most part the food items are pretty consistent. The food is amazing and top notch quality!  The food is always on point and consistent with the quality. I have brought so many of my friend over the last 2 years and every single one of them fell in love as I did and they have started to bring more of their friends as well.  I have had many other Indian Buffets before but non of them compare to this place.  When I first started coming the prices were very good and I really liked it but recently the price has gone up (Especially on weekend they often have specials now with champagne and it is much more expensive than the week days) Even with the price increase this place is too good not to come and I still try to go often even though I moved a little bit further away.  Oh and the mango smoothie is included with lunch buffet and is delicious and unlimited garlic nun is dangerous because it is so addicting and good!  Our main server is very friendly always welcomes me back warmly and usually recognizes most of the friends I have brought in over the years since they have all become repeat customers.  I'll sure be going soon after I write this review and I suggest you go and find out what you have been missing out on ASAP.
