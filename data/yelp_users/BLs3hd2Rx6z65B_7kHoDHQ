Absolute worst customer service ever. I sent an email with my specs on 11/13 to James. He said he would work it up and get back to me. He never did. I followed up with him on 11/19 and he said he will work it up and have it to me by Friday 11/22. He immediately charged by credit card. Still no call or completion. I called up once again on Wedneday 11/27 and asked about the status. James was not in the office and called back on Monday 12/2 to find out nothing was done, no production at all. James apologized and said he would have it by the end of the day. I asked to speak to Dominic the manager who seemed like it was not a big issue at all, so then I spoke to Ernie the owner. I told him I was trying to get signs done since 4 weeks ago and James consistenty dropped the ball. I asked for a full refund and will take my business elsewhere. I was referred to a Realtor that does quite a big business with them and really disappointed. Highly recommend to go somewhere else. You get what you pay for and this place has zero customer service.

I have been going to Dr Vu for over 5 years and wouldn't go anywhere else. He has amazing bed side manners and is a perfectionist with his skills. I recommend all my friends to him and they all love him. The staff is always friendly and inviting. And the office is state of the art.

I always have heard Brothers Tailors was an amazing place to go for clothing and alterations and they were right! I highly recommend Mary Zarob. She has a background in fashion from NYC and help me with many pieces as well as altering many of my existing pieces of clothing. She is patient, has a great eye for fashion and wonderful to work with.

Best steak place in Arizona by far. This is where the martinis are flowing and the steaks are cooking. I go there at least 3-4 times a month. Ask for Natalie or Ron. Those are my favorite  servers. From the moment you go into this historic restaurant (go through back door via kitchen), you are greeted with a friendly host. They all know me by name which reminds me of a Cheers atmosphere. Here is what I recommend. Start off with some oysters and shrimp cocktail, bone in ribeye (med rare), caesar salad with anchovies, either the waffle fries or garlic mash.A must is the martinis. Check out an extra dirty belvedere martini up with blue cheeses olives or get a bottle of their amazing red wine (Truly). And for dessert...the strawberry shortcake (massive). You can't go wrong here.

A company is not anything without great employees who care as well as service behind their name. You definitely get that with Community Tire Pros. Both Lorenzo (Manager at Greenway/32nd store) and Jeremy R go over and beyond what you would expect from a store. I was having issues with my tires on a branch new vehicle. The road noise was driving me nuts. I decided to check out Community Tire and so glad I did. They treated me like I was their only customer. I got new 22 inch tires and didn't like them and they have a 30 day ride window. I decided to get smaller tires and rims and that solved the issue. Lorenzo and Jeremy had excellent communication skills throughout the process, kept me in formed and the most important factor, honest!. You should not go anywhere else but Community Tire. Amazing service and quality. Customer for life.

I have been going to see Dr Dom and Dr Matt for awhile. This place is amazing. It is not your typical chiropractic office where they want to see you on a plan that just incurs costs. They actually care about my wellbeing and have my best interests at heart. The office is clean, the staff is nice and I referred many clients to them over the years and they have the same positive feedback.

Don't waste your time calling this company. Learn from my mistake. First, this company was challenging to even make an appointment on the weekend. They preferred to come out during the week. Sorry, but not everyone can take off work for an estimate. And, then for an estimate to be done, they charge $25.00. Why do you charge someone a fee to give a quote? Yes, they return it if you go with them, but absolutely absurd to charge someone a fee to get business. It is the cost of getting new business. So, they just came out today to give an estimate and a small China cabinet (5'X3') would cost over $1875.00 to do. Ridiculous! Save your $25.00 estimate fee and go somewhere else on YELP. That is what I am going to be doing.

Excellent service. Justin came over to my home at 3.15 pm on Saturday and didn't leave until 8pm. He is very thorough, detailed and got all the stains out. He is a pleasure to do business with and I am a client for life.

This is my second purchase at the store. I first purchased a True elliptical and today I decided to buy a bike. Excellent service, great prices and easy to deal with. No pressure tactics and a client for life. Thank you Bob for all your help.

Went there for the first time. I highly recommend the bone in ribeye (medium rare). The shrimp and oysters are amazing. I have not seen such big pieces of seafood since I lived back east. Wine selection was great, recommend the zin. Don't forget about the butter cake dessert. I took that home because I was so full. I even got a call by the Manager the next day (Memorial Day in fact) and asked how our dinner was. Impressive I have to say.

Had an amazing dinner tonight. Service was great. Becky was an amazing server. She was attentive, knew the menu and suggestive items on the menu. Love the chop salad and macaroni and cheese.

Don't look any further for a reliable, honest piano mover. We inherited a vintage baby grand and needed it moved from CA to Phoenix, AZ. Greg was reliable, on time, has great communication and gave a fair and honest quote. Highly recommend him for any of your needs.

When I thought Fez couldn't get any better it did. I was thrilled when Fez was moving closer to downtown because it was closer to my home. I highly recommend the egg white omelette for brunch. It is filled with spinach and was absolutely divine. I also tried the new yellow curry dish for dinner and that too was also amazing. Personally I think service is even better in this new space. Right on the light rail with a huge patio. I brought a colleague there for lunch yesterday and had one of their signature salads as well. The butter leaf salad is awesome.

Not sure where to begin here. Awful service, drinks and experience. The bloody Marys were like tomato juice and horseradish with no liquor. The GM says there was 12 ounces but I doubt it. The white sangria was watered down and awful. The fries were soggy and not cooked all the way.The service was even worse. Took 45 minutes to get drinks after waiving down a manager, waitress never asked how we wanted burgers and came out wrong. I know this place is new but nothing stood out that will make me come back.

I have insurance with Patrick Hassett on my 2nd home. He shops over 20 different insurance companies and gave me the lowest rates compared to other big guys in the state. He is always available and a pleasure to work with. Even when my renewals come up, he shops to see if he can save me money.
