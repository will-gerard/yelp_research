What are you in the mood for?  I truly suggest this place if you're looking for grade D salad and such AND if you want to leave in a clinically depressed state of mind.  Pros:  All you can eat  Cons:  Why in the world would you want more than a bite????? Every different lettuce bowl contained gross amounts of browning greens.  While the spinach looked and tasted fresh, the romaine was not, the parmesan was the kind that resembles anthrax or cocaine, the dressing was uber-salty and quite disgusting, the bacon bits contained no trace of pig, and there was no protein other than cubed ham to be found.    While I can see how the entire soup/salad/pasta/fruit/pizza/ice cream/tacos? package might be worth $7 and change, this was a horrible buy for a person looking for a salad with some ample protein.  When your name contains the word "salad," don't you think you should offer some good greens?

Since I just poured through a number of reviews for this establishment, I feel ready to brawl.  Here goes *dukes up*...  This is a great... GREAT blues and rock venue.  It's small, it's cramped, it's hot, it's loud, it's junky yet sophisticated, it has alcohol and bathrooms, and it's near a dubious part of town.  Basically, without any one of these components, it might not be worth anything.  Fortunately, it has all the pieces, and is a complete music venue.  I feel my opinion has to be worth something because I'm from Music City, USA (Nashville, TN for anyone who cares or didn't know) YEEHAW!  While you're now thinking I'm a hick, I will suggest that living in Nashville brings one close to music and allows one to know where to find it.  This place is grade A.  Phoenix could use more live music, but www.statesidepresents.com has an incredible list of shows to come in 2010 if anyone is interested...  I digress.  Rhythm Room is awesome.  Saw some crappy Battle of the Bands here and didn't care for the music, but was in awe of the ambiance.  Cheers, Rhythm Room.

No, this is not Austin-Bergstrom with its clean, beautiful terminals and new-car scent.  No, it's not SFO with its classical entrance, singingly busy hallways, and cool aura.  It is, however, one of the most efficient airports in the country, especially considering the daily flight volume.  I agree that PHX needs a makeover in places, but terminal four's D Gates are nice and new (and thankfully where I fly in/from each time) and the rest of the airport is far nicer than disrepair.  I have never experienced major traffic issues here, and although parking is a pain with lizards and birds running you from place to place, it's certainly manageable if you simply pay attention.    I've never experienced a long delay as I have in Denver and San Francisco, and the turbulence is only kind of scary in the summer when its 193 degrees outside.

I think all good evenings start when you check into a hotel accompanied by two ladies wearing skin-tight, thigh-length dresses...  I, along with two lovely female friends, stayed at the HGI Scottsdale for NYE in hopes of avoiding a trip to Tent City.  It was truly captivating scanning the looks on all faces (staff, hotel and bar patrons, and my two female friends' reactionary faces) when I walked in with two bombshells.  Even better was the inspection we received as the three of us disappeared into the elevator.  BEST was the morning after when I emerged in gym shorts and a tee while the two presented themselves in last night's garb in a true "walk of shame" manner.    Did I mention one was my fiancee and the other was her boss?  For the sake of an accurate review - this hotel is new, clean, and well-staffed.  All gawkers, I mean employees, were friendly and helpful, and they didn't pass (too) much judgment given the situation.  Additionally, they provided extra water as they knew we'd need it the following morning.    Would stay here again vs. TC.

First trip to Grimaldi's was a winner.  They basically won the super bowl, if you will.  We have been FIGHTING this no-carb thing, and tonight we really caved.  I bought a 4-pack of beer, pledging to return to it once I satisfied my blood-type-thirst for pizza.  We ended up in Old Town and Cassie recommended Grimaldi's based on a whim.  Quickly seated and greeted, and although our table was at a busy corner, we had a great perspective of the entire place, most importantly the brick-oven.  Our caesar salad came quickly and was better than average.  Shortly after, our "small" Italian sausage and mushroom pizza arrived, and fully satiated our ravenous appetites.  Fresh mozzarella, flavorful sausage, and delicious sauce, all combined with perfectly crispy crust... Mmmmm.  Pizza.  Will (we'll) be back.

Things to note - Roughly 30 draft and 150 bottled beers are never a bad thing; when you brew your own beer and are still ballsy enough to sell other beers, it's usually not a bad thing; when your servers are personable, helpful, and non-presumptuous, beer tastes sweeter; and finally, when you can either drink the bar's beer on premises or take it home with you, I'm completely sold.  Good prices paired with an outstanding selection make for a "don't miss" combo.  I was happy with the Oude Zuipers tripel-style ale while my fiancee enjoyed a unique IPL (India pale lager) from another local brewery.   We haven't eaten here but I'm sure that will come in time as beer undoubtedly generates hunger.

All show, no delicious burrito.  This place is a decent spot for a group of people to meet for a quick bit, drinks, and a walk to Mill Ave.  It is not, however, a good Mexican restaurant.  The service was very slow.  We had 5 people and all of us were drinking, yet our server seemed completely uninterested in our party.  Typically, this would not be the case unless the place was slammed and leaking extraneous guests, but on this night there were not a whole lot of folks in-house.  The food was so-so.  Chimichanga was the best dish I sampled, but it was not impressive.  I'd rather have Chipotle any day.  The Sahara Rd. Vegas location is much better and much more accomodating.  Maybe this location could learn a thing or two from its other franchises.

Being on a "low carb" diet, I've all but eliminated beer (my favorite food group) from my weekly diet.  I walk near beer coolers in groceries, I change the channel when beer commercials take the screen, and I even avoid eye contact with people wearing shirts sporting beer logos.  This has been a tough, depressing month...  i've lost a true love.  Today, I was summoned by a friend to check out Top's.  Since I'm traveling home this weekend and love spoiling my southeastern friends and family w/ west coast hoppy goodness, I obliged.    I immediately recognized the Temper Trap playing on the store sound system as I entered.  I hear, "Our love was lost, but now we found it."  Since I now subscribe to the Metaphor of the Day club, I took this as a sign.   To qualify my review, I'll say this:  I was here to buy beer.  And did I ever buy beer!  Top's has a selection that surpasses any I've seen outside of big-city CA or NYC.  Deep distribution of domestic and foreign craft beer, with phenomenal service.  The owner came over and spoke to me for 10 minutes as though we'd been in business together for years.  He personally recommended several beers according to my specs, and I walked away happy as I would be with a box of Samoas or a hot Krispy Kreme original glazed.  Check this place out for beer that rocks.

La Casa Vieja.  "The old house."  Old news.  Perhaps the focus should have been more on the food than on the shell of the setting.  Mill Ave. is new and needs something to play Ritalin to its ADD, but there must be something more than Monti's.  Long and short:  Steak- ordered med-rare, served med-rare plus (not a big issue to me).  FLAVORLESS and DRY.  If I go back, I'll see if the ribeye is better, but I am already judgmental here.  Bread- awesome.  Ate way too much of it.  Service- polite, yet not knowledgeable.  A big minus in my mind.  Company- they were... Well, I shouldn't rate my friends.  I'll try it again to be more sure of myself, but this was still a big disappointment.

Since I'm on a low-carb diet, I never imagined I'd be able to eat pizza without cheating like a vengeful ex.  Then, thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I found Mamma Mia and its 10 carb pizza.  For $5.95+tax.  Sold.  Show up at the store, where there are a few people on the "patio" happily chowing down on what looks to be some tasty grub.  Once I walk inside, I feel the warm, home-owned vibe that makes my tummy smile.  I pay my dues (under $6.50 with tax minus tip), wait 6 minutes, and voila! the pizza is ready.    Armed with crushed red pepper and fresh parmesan from the restaurant, I dig in when I return to my office, savoring each pepperoni-and-cheese covered bite.  This is not the best pizza I've had; however, I can't imagine a 10 carb pizza being any better.  Crispy, thin, wheat crust, flavorful ingredients, and a short drive from work?  Wow!    I will return, and may upgrade my already high rating!

I'm now a Hilton veteran and have stayed in dozens of their hotels, including some of their higher end properties.  I came to this GVC with high expectations, but was promptly let down.  Before I list the "amenities," I want to advise people that many of the reviews here are discussing the HGVC on Karen Ave, which is across a parking lot from the Las Vegas Hilton.  YES, that hotel has a small gym; yes, that hotel is across from another Hilton; NO, this hotel is neither of those.  Things I appreciated:  Big, clean room; separate bedroom; Tower 2 (newer, taller tower) has nice, modern appointments; TRIPLE HHonors POINTS!!!; ample parking (fee waived due to length of stay); great gym for a hotel; game room; on-site convenience store; on strip but still quiet.  Things that disappointed:  as someone else said, $8/day self-parking?  It was waived b/c I stayed 11 days, but that's still ridiculous for anyone else considering the casinos allow free parking; extremely poor service/attention from staff - more in a minute on that; over-priced convenience store; tower 1 (older, shorter tower) is quite dated and uncomfortable + non-smoking floor reeked of smoke.  I could have lived w/ the above, but then I had a major issue w/ the staff, eventually involving the manager who did very little other than call and make sure I was "OK" in my room.  Short of it - they pre-charged my card for the entire amount which was contravening to the hotel's policy and then said they couldn't finalize the refund w/o my bank's intervention.  Their internet didn't work so instead of fixing it, they CHARGED me for an ethernet cable, even after the huge debit from my account.  They put me in a really warn-down room in Tower 1 and my request to change rooms was ignored by the front desk until I asked for and spoke w/ the manager.  They still over-billed me in the end, and neglected to issue the promised triple points to my account, citing a "rule" that I still have not found.  This was a terrible hotel experience, all due to service, and I'd completely recommend against the hotel if not for its convenience and comfort.

Beautiful views, multiple trails, lots of enthusiastic outdoors-peeps, and a good location.  This is a great park!  We hiked about halfway to the top of the main peak when the rain became quite visible to the north, so we unfortunately had to come down before we saw the summit.  However, we enjoyed a semi-challenging, steep and rocky climb that led to spectacular views of most of the valley, and we were likely only 2/3 of the way up!  Also, we noted there are many other trails to explore, so we'll certainly return when we're looking for a nice afternoon stint in the sun!

Va Bene was the second dinner my fiancee and I had in Phoenix.  First was a Mexican food chain where the waiter greeted us with a free dessert sampler after spending countless minutes describing our new home (while dealing with 4-5 other tables, too), so we weren't expecting much.  On the contrary, we were extremely pleased by what we found.  Our bartender, Randy, remembered us on our second visit which was over a month after our first.  Now, we go as often as I'm home and enjoy a solid happy hour filled with cheap well drinks, beers, house wines, and half-price apps.  After a few drinks and an appetizer or two, we're always ready cross the street to our apartment and "cook."    Va Bene features live music at least once per week and is loaded with cougars, so bring your magnums if you're in the mood to hunt...  Great atmosphere, great service, and high-quality Italian food are enough for me any day.

Please allow me to begin by saying that all my reviews are category specific, meaning that if I believe this place is a sports bar/pub, I'll rate it according to my relative standards for such an establishment.  That said...  This is a fantastic sports bar.  Big screens, cold and lots of beer, GREAT food, and good service.  While Cassie and I are not regulars, we have been more than 5 times now, and have yet to be disappointed.    When here, please try:  Raspberry Chipotle Boneless Wings - yes, as good as they say, and deserving of the "franchise" tag; Spicy K Barbecue Pork Sandwich - delicious w/ flavorful BBQ sauce and cheap!; Hatch Burger - spicy, w/ flavorful beef and cooked to order; Barbecue Cheddar Melt - fantastic!!!; BBQ Burger - if it's slathered in BBQ, it's delicious!; Beer-Battered French Fries - especially good w/ cheese; and Onion Rings - crispy and tasty!  My opinion is that these burgers are better than Delux Burger's...  Let the games begin.

Second only to Total Wine in terms of price and selection.  I really enjoy that their beer selection, although not fully comprehensive, features a number of individually packaged beers in the refrigerated section - something that Total Wine doesn't have... yet.  Also enjoy the weekly sales and the accessories selection.

I stayed at the Palazzo during my first foray into the wilds of Vegas.  It was, without a doubt, a memorable stay.  I spent little time in the casino, but did explore the property.  Everything in tow was part of the grand spectacle that is this hotel.  I was truly impressed by the beauty of the place, especially once compared with some of the more southern strip hotels and casinos.  It is adequately close to all the fun, but is still far enough north to stay relatively quiet.  The pool was beautiful, surrounded by lots of tool-bags, and the lifeguards were, unfortunately, very strict about glass on the pool deck.  I had to pour my delicious Dogfish Head beer out :(  The room:  Fantastic.  Plush, comfortable, stylish...  Sexy.  Anytime I get a brown velvet-textured sectional as hotel furniture, I'm extremely happy.  The bathroom was gorgeous, complete w/ LCD TV for anyone who can't stop getting the fix.  I was on floor 35 w/ a beautiful view of the Wynn, Encore, and everything north and east.  The room was exceptionally quiet and clean and smelled lovely upon entry.  Would I stay again?  Absolutely.  Would I take more money?  Definitely.

On average, the best prices and some of the best selection (beer, wine, and spirits) I have seen.  Also, knowledgeable, helpful, and non-pushy staff.  Very highly recommended for any booze-seeking Phoenician!

Upon scrolling through a list of local recommendations as provided by a co-worker I've never met, I decided to choose Avalon as the destination for my anniversary dinner.  I was definitely pleased with the decision.  Here's why:  First - the atmosphere is lovely.  Relaxed, modern, and clean, with creative lighting and inspiring design.  The music was audible, yet didn't drown our conversation.  I was slightly disappointed that the host didn't seat us in a private corner since we called days in advance and made reservations AND since the place wasn't incredibly busy since it was Sunday evening, but we still had a great seat with views of entire restaurant, including the awesome patio.  Second - the food.  Wow, was the food good!  I started with the Tuscan Bread Salad, a delicious mix of greens, mozzarella, Heirloom tomatoes, and sourdough bread.  My fiancee, who chose the prix fixe menu, started with the Calamari Frittes which were tender with a deliciously light, crispy breading.  Our entrees were a prime ribeye, cooked perfectly med-rare, for me, and Pacific salmon for Cassie, a nicely-sized and very fresh fillet cooked to a delectable medium.  Our desserts were amazing - She ordered the Chocolate Decadence, an appropriately named block of heaven, while I picked the Roasted Banana Bread Pudding, which was unbelievably amazing.  Outstanding showing on the final course, but the whole meal was insanely good.  Drinks - this is where they lose points in my opinion.  It being our anniversary, we decided to splurge and buy a bottle of bubbly.  We decided, since we'd never tried it, to go for the yellow-label Veuve Clicquot.  To our dismay, they were out!  From there, we decided to step down to the Moet & Chandon, another higher-end champagne we'd never tried, and...  They were out of it, too!  Wow!  I'll admit that I didn't call ahead and ask them to save a bottle, but geez!  Your two best bottles are both AWOL?  We "settled" for the Roederer Estates L'ermitage, which happened to be a great bottle of sparkling at a slightly lower price.  However, the mental damage was done.  Their explanation was that they were re-structuring their list, but I was still a bit disappointed by the outcome.  All-in-all, this was a great meal with only a minor setback.  We will return given the chance and I'm excited to see what they cook up on our next visit!

We revisited Avalon for New Year's Eve and had the best meal I've experienced since moving to Phoenix.  This place is top shelf!  As before, the food was absolutely excellent.  I had prime rib, expertly cooked to medium rare, while my cohorts dined on prime tenderloin and luscious chicken.  Apps and drinks were dangerously tasty, and our dessert was, once again, truly outstanding.    Please take your business to Avalon, as I applaud their devotion to an exceptionally fine dining experience.

Now is the time to visit Aria.  While occupancy rates in hotels are lower than ever, these rooms are in the bargain basement, waiting to be scooped up by budget-watchers like me!  $129/night got me a deluxe room (king bed, non-smoking and clean) with a huge bathroom, nice toiletries, a beautiful TV, a decent west LV and mountain view, and a $100 resort credit, which bought 3 great meals for me.  The room was comfortable, the linens soft, and the ability to control the room from either the TV remote or the touch-screen remote at bed side made for a lazy evenings and effective mornings.  I programmed the curtains to open, the lights to come on, and the TV to show re-runs of Roxanne every morning to make sure I'd jump out of bed!  Parking was much better than expected.  With such a huge development, I figured that I'd have to walk 3 or 4 nautical miles to reach my room.  However, I typically parked on the walkway floor and was in my room 10 minutes after parking.  The fact that most parking spots are greatly spaced out seemed wasteful, but then again, it made for worry-free, comfortable parking.  I will stay here again so long as the rates don't force a refi of my mortgage.

Japanese teppanyaki at a ridiculously low price!  When I visited the website and saw "Nothing over $10" next to "Filet, Shrimp, and Salmon," I had my doubts.  I paid $7.51 (with tax) for a chicken breast plate that included my choice of white rice, brown rice, fried rice, or lo mein, and any number of veggies on a second list.  Volcano Grille has a number of sauces to entertain, from the eponymous "Hot Lava" and "Hot Magma" to the flavorful "Japanese Salsa" and appeasing "Spicy Teriyaki."    Volcano Grille is a great buy.  Check it out!

Two of my coworkers and I visited Jean-Georges Steakhouse last week since we had resort credit at Aria that was setting our pockets en fuego.  We knew it would be pricey and expected the food to be delectable.  Both assumptions were proven to be accurate.  Decor is posh.  Lots of abstract cow faces all about the room (once you arrive, you'll see what I mean).  Also enhancing the decor is the group of constant gawkers standing in front of the restaurant who look at the menu and gaze inside, hoping to see a celebrity or otherwise rich person.  My meal was fantastic.  An uncannily delicious Caesar salad started my evening.  Lemony, light, and topped with fresh, mouthwatering Romano.  Maybe my favorite Caesar of recent years.  The freebie breads were also tasty, adding a nice bit of peripheral value to the high prices of the dishes.  Next came the main course - 12 oz. filet, cooked rare-med rare, with creamed spinach and some shared asparagus.  The steak was lovely - seared on the outside, warm and red middle, flavorful and thoroughly enjoyable.  My 12 ouncer was more like a solid pound of filet, thus keeping the enjoyment alive for a few more savory minutes.  The sides were both excellently prepared, with the asparagus being a wonderful surprise.  Simultaneously, I enjoyed a Hitachino Nest White Ale, a beer I'd never before tried.  This added another bit of happiness to an already memorable meal.  My only "Eh, Not so Sure About This" at Jean-Georges was the service.  Our primary server was attentive as is to be expected at both a high-end steakhouse and at a restaurant with only 4 other customers present (we went early).  On the other hand, the server's assistants were quite clumsy and made several fumbles during our meal.  For example, one assistant acted as though the thought of a split check was the Grand Unified Theory of particle physics and I'm fairly sure a tear came to his eye when I asked that unforgivable inquiry.  Additionally, one assistant poured a colleague's bottled beverage into the cups of the other people at our table who weren't enjoying this beverage, effectively mixing two things that did not mix and wasting my colleague's investment.  On the whole, I provide a strong recommendation for this restaurant.  I suggest going around 6:30; that way you beat the rush but can enjoy the show.  Viva!

I am on a personal mission to try every FroYo, Frogurt, Yogurt Trough, etc. in the valley.  This is our latest discovery.  I'll fast forward to the encounter at the register.  Cashier:  "Total is $6.87" Cassie:  "Are you sure you didn't leave mine off the scale?" Me:  "Wait, it's Valentine's Day.  This is a sale, isn't it?" Cashier:  "Nope.  We always charge $0.30/ounce." Me and Cassie:  "God d******."  We prefer the self-service Frogurt stops, and this one has 12? flavors, making it the top of the chain in that department.  Also, the vast mixins are a real turn-on.  And when a place has high quality, high quantity, and is charging 25% less than competition, what isn't to adore?  Yogurtland beats them all.  Nuff said.

I previously committed to my first love, Yogurtland, that she was the fairest  find in Phoenix froyo.  I am now afraid that her crown is in danger of being usurped by this new gem.  Zoyo is $0.35/oz., which is $0.05/oz. more than Y-Land.  This really adds up when you get a pint and a half at each pass.  However, Zoyo has creamy flavors, such as Cake Batter-Batter-Batter-SWING and Red Velvet and Cheesecake and mmmmmmmmMMMM it KEEPS GETTING BETTER!  Plus, they have SnoCaps as a topping.  What's up!??!?  (others may also have SnoCaps, but this is the first place where I've noticed them, so props!)  The yogurt itself really is the star of the Zoyo froyo show.  Plus, I can walk here in 3 minutes. 3 MINUTES!  I know this is a sinful reason to rate this place so highly, but the rest of the facts and opinions really support my love of Zoyo!    I welcome anyone to come eat at Zoyo with me so I can fill up my punchcard faster!
