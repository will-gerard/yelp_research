One of the few good places that allow dogs. The negative- the parking Is horrendous and the outdoor patio where dogs are allowed is completely full of pretentious a-holes who could sit anywhere in restaurant but chose to sit at the 6 tables dogs are allowed at and sip on their waters for 2 hours while half of the table are reserved for other larger parties.  The positive- the food, the staff, and the beer selection are truly fantastic, but these terrible patrons sit there staring at you with your dog and and your 2 year old child as they continue to waist oxygen on this earth.  And before you think I'm some 45 year old bitter woman, you should know that I'm 24 single dad how loves to try new places, but after trying this place 3 desperate times I'll never be going back again.

Took us over an hour to get 1 pizza in which they apparently dropped the first one and at no point informed us of the delay. The manager didn't know what he was doing at all and was talking to us like children and making excuses rather then finding a solution.

The food was great as most smash burgers, but the customer service at this specific location was fantastic.
