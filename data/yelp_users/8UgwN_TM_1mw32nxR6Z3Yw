3.5 really. my view is they always have the comics i want and they aren't shady at all - they aren't like those stores that hold on to extra copies then jack up the prices and sell them a week later. they put everything on the shelves and they really love their comics.  the staff is always super friendly, not pretentious at all. the only thing i don't like about the place is their loyalty program. you get a stamp card that gets 1 stamp for every $10 you spend (so if you spend $18 in one purchase, that's 1 stamp. $20 =  2 stamps). After you get 10 stamps, you get $5 off your purchase. so the most you're getting is a 5% discount every few weeks, but more likely you're getting a much smaller %. Many other comic shops do programs where you get a certain % off every week depending on how many subscriptions you have set up.   other than that though, they're nice people with a great selection and they're always welcoming.

i'm a former new orleanian, so i came in to this place a skeptic.  the red beans and rice were outstanding. i wouldn't give it a 100%, but a solid 90. I'd be happier if there were cornbread and if they had crystal hot sauce. also, better rice to bean to sausage ratio (currently needs more rice and sausage, slightly less bean).  i also had the boudin balls. they were good in and of themselves, but they were served with garlic bread (i don't think i was ever served garlic bread in a cajun restaurant during my years in nola) and some weird marmalade. i still have no idea what that marmalade was or why it was there, but again, the boudin itself was great.  the hush puppies were also really good.   the portions were giant, and i'd definitely go back time and time again.

Gus is absolutely the man. The other guy working there, who I believe is his son, is also very good at what he does, as is Gus' wife.  I went in to get a custom suit, and could tell that Gus took a ton of pride in his work. He had very strong opinions on what my suit should look like because he wanted to make sure that anyone who saw the suit would be impressed by it. We ended up picking out a great material, and a few weeks later the suit was ready.  I'd always heard the expression "fits like a glove", but I never really understood it until I tried that suit on. I *thought* I had worn suits that fit me in the past, but now I know I was sorely mistaken. This guy is going to be making all of my suits as long as I'm in the valley.

so the bartender was nice, and the beer wasn't pricey, but still. when i walked in, a thought came to mind that I can honestly say had never hit me before walking into any other bar.  "that guy who runs bar rescue would have a field day with this place". There's so much potential for a bar at that location, but something about it just feels like management doesn't care/has no interest in making it a remotely popular place. I think I only know two people who speak highly of the place, and all of their friends disagree with them. I want to love this place but it's just so darn divey that i have to believe there are health code violations of some sort there.   I'm totally willing to believe that a year or two ago, this was a fun and popular dive, but I got the feeling this place was on a sharp decline.

yes, if you're looking for something super expensive and fancy, or somewhere to take a date, you'll be out of luck here.  but if you want a hole-in-the-wall mexican place, i feel like this one can't be beat. huge portions, cheap prices, and there's just something about it i can't place. i just love it so.  its breakfast burritos are always there for me if I need them (chorizo, but also poke a hole in the bottom of the burrito before you start eating it because you're going to want a way for the oil to drip out as you eat it). The carne asada fries have helped me through many a boring saturday. by that i mean if i was bored on a saturday afternoon, i would eat them and then take a nice long nap through the afternoon. if you can stay awake after a portion that size, you're probably on meth.   anyway, i'm always going to love this place. i hope the family running it finds a way to get rich off of this.

note: I was at an event here, so I can't speak to their typical service.  what I can say, though, is that our group had a BLAST. we're large (something like 300 people) and we're famously rowdy, but the whole staff here was nothing but patient and welcoming with us.   the only reason it's not 5 is because i feel like i save 5 stars for businesses i know better or am super wow'd by. I'd have to go back here for dinner or just drinks with friends to know for sure. but what I can say is that they've hosted parties for us regularly and they are always very accommodating.

I can't speak to the food here, I've only ever had it drunk. Also, I've never ordered it, I've just stolen it from friends. If memory serves, the food was fine.  But more importantly is the beer. It's reasonably priced. Also, the people-watching is great because the crowd is ridiculously hipster. Yes, I realise the irony at staring at a bunch of hipsters, feeling superior, and judging them, but I guess that's part of why I feel so at home here. In a way, aren't we all obnoxious hipsters who don't know how to dress?

Went here on a date a while back with the lady. The food was delicious and it was served quickly. They had a pretty solid craft beer selection too. I'd definitly go back.

Delicious beer, even delicious-er pasties. If I could live here, I would.   There's maybe nothing I would improve upon except slightly faster service. But even then, I've never gone here while I was in a rush so that's never been a major issue.   The Pilgrim is my favorite, but my friend recently ordered the beef abodobe or something like that and it looked so good I thought about murdering him so I could take it. Ultimately I decided I was too full to eat it, but that guy knows to watch his back now.

The food could be worse. It's like domino's quality but not quite there. The wings, however, were prefectly hot. not as crispy or anything as i would prefer, but their hot sauce brings a good amount of heat.  Here's the real issue: we ordered at around 11 pm on a Monday night, and we didn't get our pizza until closer to 12:30 AM. Also, I felt like it was expensive for the quality/portions.  I'd only order from them again for the same reason I ordered from them this time - literally no one else would bring me pizza at that time of night.

The sushi wasn't bad by any means, but i definitely felt like it was really overpriced for the quality. I think our bill came out to about $80. I'd say it felt like it was probably worth more like $50.   having said that, the servers were nice and they were very fast with out food, but i feel like either the portions were to small of their prices were just too high.

I love this place. The short rib burger is amazing, albeit a bit sweet. and they have the best sweet tots in the valley.  i hate that they never answer the phone so you can't really call in to order for pick up, and the service can be pretty hit-or-miss, but the food is always quality.

they have a great beer selection and tuesday trivia rules. also, the waitress stefanie is one of the coolest people ever.  having said that, i find the food a little lacking. i ordered buffalo wings and they came out completely dry. there was a little flavor, but no sauce at all on them. also, i had a waitress who wasn't stefanie this past tuesday and i felt like *maybe* she was overwhelmed, but it definitely took more time than i expected to get our food/drinks/bill.  go for tuesday trivia. its my favorite trivia in the valley.

Been going here for years and i can still say I'm a fan.  the ONE thing I don't love is that they don't have beer lists readily available at tables, because they want you to download their app. it's just an extra step that i'm not into at all. if i didn't already have the investment in boulders, it would honestly make me think twice about going there. I'm just not a fan of making that app replace lists at the tables.   other than that, solid atmosphere, decent bar food. I can sincerely say that the quality of service there varies GREATLY from server to server. it seems like some really want their customers to be happy and others just sort of want to make it through the day.   the bartender who i think is named Chris takes his job seriously and always has good recommendations. Also, can't say enough nice things about their waitress Stefanie. I typically try to sit in her section if I can look around and see if she's working. Everyone there is nice and pleasant, I just feel like I get better service from these two in particular.   Tuesday trivia still as fun as ever. Their hot wings are also delicious, though I wish there were a little bit crispier.

the other reviewers aren't lying. the duck club is great.  also, the servers here were really great. like, at a point it almost felt like our waiter joined our group and was just hanging out with us talking, making actual good contribution to our conversation. it was kind of awesome.  great food, great service, not pretentious at all. i'd definitely go back over and over.

Have you ever had food so good you wish you could just put it in a blender and then had it put in to an IV so you could just have a constant supply of it running through your bloodstream?  I have. It happened at Lolo's.   I don't use the word "synergy" often, because anyone who does should be punched in the face, but I'm telling you that chicken & waffles equals more than just the sum of their parts. It's basically a religious experience.  Also the chili cheese friends are amazing and the mac n cheese is the most velveeta-y mac n cheese i've ever had.  not only would i recommend friends eat here, but i think it would be morally acceptable to force you friends to eat here. you should be allowed to use any force necessary to make sure friends and loved ones eat here.

the menu always changes, so i can't make any recommendations, but everything here was delicious and the waitstaff was very prompt and polite. they had a great wine list and some interesting sounding cocktails too.

right now they have a pecan pie flavor and honestly, i think when i ate it, i found jesus for like a second.  for that one brief cup of froyo, everything was beautiful and nothing hurt.  get the damn pecan pie froyo. you won't regret it.

this place is amazing, its like chipotle but sushi instead of burritos. you go down the line adding whatever you want to your roll, and its all incredibly reasonably priced and super fast.   i can't believe i haven't eaten at this place sooner. i'll be coming back as often as possible.

I will never forget the first time I ate the "porkster" burger here, mostly because never before had I had impure thoughts about a hamburger.   the decor is fine, though i do wonder why there are so many damn bikes strapped to the walls/ceiling. the servers have been friendly and attentive every time i've been there.

i've been off work for just over two weeks now and i've made it a goal to have froyo every day since then (wearing pajamas when possible). So I write this review with, what i feel to be, a certain level of expertise in the field of froyo places in the valley.  what i like about this place is that its got a lot of space and comfy couches and frankly, it looks cool. also, free wifi doesnt hurt. also, i'm pretty sure they make their froyo from scratch, and there is a note on the board behind the register saying they're always open to new flavor suggestions (c'mon, pecan pie!)  what i didn't like was i felt like there was a pretty limited selection of froyo flavors, and frankly, some of them are bad. nutella is always, ALWAYS a bad froyo flavor. i've never met anyone who likes it, and anyone who does like it is just wrong. it's that simple.  i'd totally go back, but i still think zoyo on 7th ave is my favorite.

I have to admit, the only reason this place isn't getting *1* star is because two people there seem like the tried in earnest to help me when a situation came up. I cancelled my membership today.  the gym itself is nice in that it's conveniently located and membership is crazy cheap. it's a very no-frills gym, but you know that going in to it. I just needed a place to do some cardio so i could pretend i was getting in shape, and this place was perfect for that. I never had to wait for a machine, it was never too crowded, the staff was always friendly.  here's my bone to pick: there are only two ways you're allowed to cancel your membership: in person, or with certified mail including a $25 check for the termination policy.   So when I moved across the country, they weren't exactly super helpful. I called and tried to cancel, they weren't exactly accommodating. yes, it's 2013 but they wouldn't let me cancel anything by phone or online. It HAD to be in person, or certified mail. they're going out of their way to be obnoxious about cancelling. I have to believe it's actually MORE difficult for them to take a cancellation by mail than it would be to just do it on the phone or online. They do it just to be annoying.   admittedly, this fell off my radar for a bit as i just moved across the country and was starting a new job. i had to get a new credit card, cancelled the old one, then youfit starting calling about not being able to process my billing. that's when they came back on my radar.   again i called and tried to cancel. the nice man there sounded like he understood the issue but his hands were tied. I reasoned with him long enough and he finally said he'd have the GM call me back. The GM called me back and basically he finally agreed to let me be the exception and cancel over the phone, but not before paying late fees and paying for months of membership during which i wasn't even in that time zone.   In that guy's defense, i feel like he actually probably stuck his neck out a little for me and corporate would be mad if they saw he cancelled my account remotely. that's basically why they are 2 stars instead of 1 - on some level i feel like they cared. just the corporate overlords suck.

first, they showed up nearly two hours late.  second, in my initial phone call with them, they said "worst case scenario, a move out clean for your apartment with a super deep clean and everything will be $300".  i only needed the kitchen, bathroom, and laundry room cleaned so i knew it wouldn't be that much. they weren't actually going to do a deep clean on an 1,100 sq foot apartment.   when they eventually did get here, they were very pleasant and nice, and they were very professional. they cleaned for just under 2 hours. the lady said it would be $69, so i wrote them a check for a little more than that to include tip.  minutes after they walked out of the door they called me and the guy demanded i pay the full $300, even thought i was quoted as that being a deep clean, worst case scenario for my whole apartment.  i talked to the owner on the phone for a bit and then he decided to do me the "huge favor" of knocking it down to $230 for me.  the clean itself was fine, the people who cleaned were very pleasant and professional, but the owner definitely made me feel like i got ripped off in this case. I don't think i'd recommend them to any of my friends looking for a move-out clean.

got a corsage from them the other day. they were very nice and helpful and really cared a lot about making sure i was happy.  i did ask about their mixed reviews and they explained a new owner took over about 9 months ago. that makes sense since they really did seem to care about customer service (and did seemed bothered by their less-than-stellar ratings).  give 'em a shot! they're good.

Came in the other night, visiting the old stomping grounds, and had Kristi as a waitress. She was OUTSTANDING!  Super engaged/engaging, very friendly and attentive. She was hilarious, too!  everyone's food was cooked perfectly - but i feel like that goes without saying. I don't see much point in reviewing the food at a chain restaraunt because everyone knows exactly what they're getting in terms of food quality as soon as they go there - that's the point of going to a chain. but Kristi was just great. I'm not sure if i had a crush on her because she was so darn awesome, or if it was just because she brought me food. Both are equally plausible.
