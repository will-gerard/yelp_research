I can really only echo Pepper T.'s post.  I don't think there's much that I can add.  Our small group of adult fun-seekers thoroughly enjoyed our night out at Organ Stop Pizza.  As others have noted, you don't come here for the pizza.  That said, it wasn't bad.  I don't think it's so poor as Chuck E. Cheese pizza (granted it's been years since I've eaten it) and it's definitely better than Little Caesar's.  It's not the cheapest, but you're also paying for the experience. Some have complained about the salad bar being a single visit deal -- which it is -- but if you work it right, you get plenty for your bucks. While we didn't get ice cream, they do have a pretty good selection of Shamrock Dairy ice creams.  It was very fun to watch the theater pipe organ in action.  It really is a show, with lots of contraptions engaging at different times throughout any given song, making it both a visual experience as well as an auditory experience.  This is another place I'd definitely revisit, were I to be in the valley.  For us, driving from Downtown, it is a drive, but for something we'll do once or twice, it's totally worth it.

Do you know how in high school, if you don't have the money (or are too cheap to spend it) for a fancy prom date?  Well, if you know, then you know you choose a fake fancy restaurant, that let's folks wear jeans, charges too much, and gives too little.  You know?  Well, that's The Melting Pot.  We were fortunate to buy a Groupon on sale, but that's not to say we felt those precious dollars were spent well.  The discount still left us feeling like we over paid.  While the food was good, the prices are ridiculously inflated.  Had I paid full price for the vegetarian entree I ordered, it would have been $25 for 4 halves of artichoke heart, 4 tofu wedges, 4 slices of mushroom, 4 asparagus stalks and 4 raviolis.  $25 is half my weekly budget in groceries.  Sorry, this ain't no prom date.  The lighting is very low and the atmosphere feels posh, kind of sleek.  So, again, some fancy feeling for you.  Apparently reservations are highly suggested (why people line up, I just don't know).  We sat at the bar, albeit comfortably.  Still, our server was pleasant and helpful.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  An attempt here and there to up sale, a smile, a description of what's in our "melting pot."  Overall, if you want to stab your food, feel fancy, and eat very little, this is the place for you.  I really don't know why anyone would spend the money it costs to eat here, when there are other options, but, if you like pretense of a prom date, this is a right fit for you.

At the moment I am very convinced of the merit of this establishment.  While I did not yet get to explore it in its entirety, I did get to see a fair share of their collection.  Not only is the building beautiful (I love the open foyers, the hard, straight walls along with the more narrow, intimate spaces.  Plus, I'm a sucker for concrete), but they have a varied collection.  I'm not a connoisseur, but I do enjoy a mix of contemporary, modern, classical etc. art, with influences from around the world.  I felt they provided in this aspect.  And the Hollywood costume collection (though a temporary feature) was awesome.  Granted, I had no expectations -- so maybe that was the key ;)  Beyond this, I really appreciated how helpful they were to me.  Let me explain.  I brought my bike to the museum (it's mostly how I get around) and then realized I had left my keys for my lock at my place...now, I'm not about to leave my baby untethered and ready for the taking.  So, not knowing what else to do, I approached the ticket desk, who directed me to the security rep.  They in turn found a place for me to store my bike in their receiving area!  This is thoroughly above and beyond.   Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my bike ye have done it unto me (is that blasphemous?).  Take care of my bike and you've got a friend/fan in me!  I'll be back PHXArt.

We've attended two Adult Puppet Slams.  The first one was hilarious.  The second one as all right, though not as fun as the first.  I do enjoy the variety each show offers, with musical and varied puppet features in each show.  It's a pretty intimate setting with a small-medium-ish size audience.  It seems like a lot of people know each other, which adds to the intimacy of the experience.  The cost for the adult show is quite reasonable, especially if you pay in advance.  I can't speak for the children's shows as I've never been.  The venue, as well as it's interesting history, is beautiful.  And if you have interest in drinking alcohol in what is essentially a Mormon church (cultural hall, specifically, for those more acquainted with the faith), then this is your chance!  I'd definitely recommend attending at least one show.  AND, if you time it right, you can stroll the Japanese Friendship garden (free on first Friday) and get dinner (I recommend El Norte√±o) before the show -- it makes for a nice evening walk.

We'd love to visit this venue again (which seems to be my theme today -- so much to revisit and so little time...).  I've seen it almost weekly on my commute home from ASU night classes and we finally made it in a few weeks ago.  This is the kind of Mexican restaurant I truly relish.  It's the small informal business that I feel is the best way to enjoy some good Mex-American cooking.  As a vegetarian, this restaurant isn't my best friend, but it is manageable.  I ended up ordering a bean and green chili chimichanga.  It was just what it needed to be -- fried, fatty and comforting.  The horchata was really great, too, and I'm picky about my rice water ;)  Cost is low.  Service is minimal.  Ambiance is one step away from full on street dining.  Think old burger joint yellow tables and bench seats, asphalt and plastic trellis walls.  If you're looking for something fancy, turn around.  If you're looking for something to hit the spot, without any pretense, run in this direction!

This place has been on my radar for a while.  With the visit of a friend last year, and a promise to buy my birthday dinner ^_^  That said, I've only been once, so my perspective is limited.  First, our waiter, an older gentleman, was awesome.  He was friendly and sociable, so made our back corner table a little warmer with his presence.  Our waters were also frequently topped off, which is _always_ a priority in my restaurant visit.  Second, the chips and salsa...among the best I can recall.  The salsa especially.  SO GOOD.  And, maybe it doesn't show on yelp, but I've eaten more than my fair share of salsa, and this one is up there (e.g. went to some Salsa fest last year in Phoenix - SO disappointing).  And they kept it coming.  I mean, the "and's" could keep coming, but I'll tap it off here.  Third, the food was good.  I can't say I was as blown away by what I ordered, but it was good, and I enjoyed the leftovers the next day.  As to the price, I suggest you also get a friend to buy you dinner.  It makes it sooo affordable.  Still, looking at the prices on the menu, you're wallet probably won't hurt much, as they seemed pretty low to me.  Still, have birthday dinners as often as you can ;)  While we still have so many Mexican places that we've yet to visit in the valley, Mi Patio is somewhere we'd consider returning to.

I dig this place.  It's nice that it's so close to home, too.  It's affordable (I hear "cheap" has a bad connotation...).  Everything we've eaten here has been delicious.  And I hope to try more.  The ambiance is...a little sanitized.  Pretty much white, white, white (walls, floors, ceiling) with minimal decor - fake plants, cheap art on the wall.  But that's not why you come here.  I enjoy the hot tea (and also very cheap...I mean inexpensive).  They have an ample section for vegetarian choices, which I appreciate.  I don't feel I can recommend any specific dishes, yet, but that day will come.  All we've tried has been worth it.  The service...well, that's one of the grey areas here.  When we first left, we laughed about how many stereotypes this place filled...sadly...but truly.  Service is one of them.  It's not untrue to say that some Chinese and/or Vietnamese owned establishments lack the same..."tenderness" that many American bred peeps tend to expect.  And it can be frustrating to be ignored when you want your check.  That's all.  If you're debating, give it a shot.

If asked to provide one word to describe my experience with Dr. A. Patel the first that comes to mind is "impersonal". I've been in for two wellness checks and one illness inspired visit. Each time, I'm not really sure how Dr. Patel knows enough about me to give me a clean bill of health. In all, we've maybe spent 15 minutes together, and that's probably generous. My second well check was under 5 minutes. It always seemed he was out the door before I could formulate my questions (and I'm not That slow).   When asking if they could reproduce a bill of health that was 6 months old, we were told we'd need to schedule another visit and pay a $20 fee.  When my partner made an appointment only to be told that some blood work needed to be completed again, they charged the same fee as though he received medical services. When asked about it, they stated that work had been done. Apparently getting weighed and having your heart pressure measured costs just over $83 with an HSA.   I've debated between one and two stars for this review. Ultimately, I've decided to go with two as on my ill visit he prescribed medication that worked. Next time, however, I won't simply choose the doctor closest to home.

First off, yay for centralized library systems!  I've lived in cities with a lone city library and others with a library system, and it simply doesn't make sense to me to have a separate system for each city/building.  So, as to limited selection...why aren't you using library loan?  If you have internet access (available at the library) just find what you want in the catalog, place a hold on it and pick it up next time you visit.  It does require some forethought, but I feel the access to such selection is well worth that little extra effort.  I favor this library solely because of its location: we shop at Costco so it's super convenient to swing by on our weekend errands.  I've always found it to be clean and never overcrowded.  Staff has regularly been friendly and helpful.  As for complaints about "homeless people"...I have words for you, but, more than anything, if you don't want to deal with the public, don't visit public spaces.

Really I can't think of a reason to give Fairway less than 5 stars.  Yes, car repairs are expensive and that's a fact of life.  But Dale definitely doesn't pull any tricks.  Where other businesses have told us we needed certain repairs, Dale has confirmed which were indeed needed and which were not.  Even when giving his own recommendations, he's transparent on what is essential and what is suggested.  Beyond being honest, Dale is quick at getting work done.  He also goes above and beyond and always makes a follow-up call to check-in on the work done.  For the three or so visits we've made to the shop he's been consistent and friendly.  The business is not right on the street front, but recessed from it, in it's own private lot, with a large parking lot.  It can be a little tricky to find, but there is clear signage.  I'd definitely recommend Fairway.  It's not just another run of the mill auto shop.

This place is the place  to be during Teach for America induction/institute.  Does it deserve so much attention?  Probably not, but they step up to the waves of alcohol hungry corps members and keep us happily intoxicated.  Now, I have no idea what it's like during the rest of the year when ASU isn't over run by TFA, but during our summer training, it's often a mad house.  What's good: they have constant specials as well as a regular happy hour.  I managed to get several large beers (I believe it was one angry orchard and a blue moon), shots of tequila (x3) and their apple pie shooter, with tip, for under $45 -- oh! and an order of fried zucchini coins.  I was contentedly drunk and happy with the weight of my wallet (I aimed  to spend $40, so it wasn't bad at all).  I'm a beer novice, so I can't at all speak to the quality or selection - but, hey, it's pretty damn affordable (maybe that's just a beer thing...I used to drink a lot more "queer beer" than anything else :) ).  Now the zucchini coins were lovely.  Crisp on the outside, soft on the inside.  Sadly, the kitchen closes well before they do (it was closed by 11 pm on a Friday).  When it's crazy in here it seems that food orders may not find their way to your table, so you'll have to keep your eyes open.    Still, the bartender (don't know his name, but particularly the guy with the pony-tail) is on top of his game.  he does a pretty good job of keeping track of who's up to order and juggles cards/cash, cups and customers pretty well.  Space here is ample, with a misted patio and kind of a three tiered room setup, with pool tables in the third "tier."  There are tables, booths and stools inside.  The decor is pretty blah and the music selection is definitely not a focal point (at least I hope not...that would be disappointing).  I've heard they mix it up some, but most of the time I haven't noticed.  It's also not too loud.  If you're looking for a hip notable ambiance, this isn't the spot for you.  If you just want to hang and not have to scream to talk, this is a decent spot.  I won't be driving across town to get here, but if I'm on campus or in the area, I'd meet friends here.

Yeah.  It's a five star.  There isn't much use denying it.  I could try and knock them for their cash only policy, or...I'm actually not sure what the "or" is.  There's some sound advice in the existing reviews, but I'll reiterate, bring cash and come early (and you certainly won't hear me say the latter often ;P ).  A matter of hours (or even less) may determine whether you get any or not!  The pan dulce here is...the best I've ever had.  And I'm no novice.  Short of eating it in Mexico (it's on my bucket list), I've had my fair share.  Given the choice, I'd come here; heck, I'd even consider ordering it via mail (not that they do that).  Some may be off put by their pretty traditional approach, but I think it's a gem for it: cash only; made fresh on site; Spanish first; warm tortillas; bright colored pastries; fair, earthly prices.  I won't say more.  Really, really, it's the place.  Hallowed be it's name.

I've heard so much about this local treasure, so it seemed an appropriate addition to my before-we-move bucket list.  And, as you can tell, we checked it off like it weren't nobodies bidness.  Really, we came for the tour.  Upon arriving, it was pretty clear where to go, though that was only because we followed another slightly unsure guest to the crowd at the far end of the building.  Shortly thereafter the tour started.  And then it ended.  Or so I thought.  The walk around tour portion is very short, so that caught me off guard.  Like, 5 minutes short.  Still, there is plenty to hear about and the "tour" guide was engaging and shared plenty of interesting facts about the facility, its history and how its used today.  After our tour, we wandered the chocolate shop and found plenty of delicious goodies.  We ended up indulging in the fill-a-bag section and it wasn't too expensive at all.  Granted, we only bought eight pieces each.  So, sixteen pieces for just under $6 may seem steep to some...still, we were very pleased.  Ultimately, if you're hoping to make a DAY of it, don't.  But if this is one stop on your Glendale or Greater Valley excursion, by all means, stop by.  It's a charming relic of simpler times...

I won't say much here because...well...it's probably already been said.  Here's the quick run down:  We went Thanksgiving morning and it was packed (which I love).  The ambiance is, like, textbook hipster, I think.  Some rugged wood, funky lamps, deviant art and coffee.  Not to mention a few fedora hats, skinny jeans and beards (but those weren't exclusive to the establishment).  I dug it.  Price. Eh, steep, but not too bad.  The food was delicious.  I got the savory pancake and it was totally not what I had envisioned, but it was awesome and I would so get it again.  Service was friendly and customer positive.  The one thing I didn't like was their pick up system.  I didn't know what I was supposed to do.  It was loud, so I didn't know if we'd hear our names or not.  We stood near the counter but somehow still missed our drinks.  Apparently they got cold so they set them aside (understood), but I don't know how we didn't hear them...so, yeah, the system didn't work for us.  Otherwise, the folks met are needs and were totally cool when we asked where our teas were.  Worth trying, and we might go back (I'm not a frequent anywhere...except my own kitchen).

I won't write much here, as I don't really do franchise reviews...and, actually, I've already written a review for another Sprouts location (or two?  I don't remember and can't be bothered to check...).  So, if you want a better run down on Sprouts, in my eyes, having shopped there for almost 5 years, please check my profile.  For now, this is a quick run down of this location.  On the downside, some of their stock is different than what we'd grown accustomed to in Salt Lake City.  The bulk section is larger, but some of the products we regularly purchased are either not available or not offered.  The teas, in particular, are not as great a quality, and they don't seem to have any fair trade teas.  Oh, and we couldn't find maple extract anywhere.  Sad day.  As for the staff, they are stellar.  There are a few faces in particular that we see and who we have been helped by.  It's nice that they seem to remember us and are especially friendly because of that.  The times we've needed help finding an item, or getting more on the shelves they have been stellar.  Once, when the ground ginger bulk jar was empty, seeing as it cost half as much as any of the pre-bagged items, the guy who helped us gave it to us free, no charge!  Really, they're friendly, helpful and never act like they're begrudgingly helping you.  And that's all folks.  If you're in the area (sadly there aren't any sprouts on the south or west side) then it's worth coming here.  We generally drive about 5 miles to get here.  But Sprouts, and specifically this location, make it worth the drive.  And, thank the gods, we have a car.

We came here with a Groupon for dinner for two.  While the ordering was a little touchy (limitations on what the Groupon includes), we really enjoyed what we ate.  We are not easily appeased, either, when it comes to anything East Asian.  While we're a little less versed in all nom-noms Korean, we are no stranger to Japanese and Chinese, as it often constitutes a good portion of our dining at home.  One of the reasons I love this genre of dining, is the versatility when it comes to vegetarian eats.  Generally speaking, the cuisine embraces tofu or simply omits meat gracefully.  Ohya's menu, while offering many meat dishes, did work well with my green preferences.  Our server was friendly, but professional.  She wasn't overbearing, and kept our waters satisfactorily full.  She also worked with us in navigating the menu and helping us get what we wanted.  The venue is strong on ambiance, though it manages this with relatively little frill.  Inside, almost everything is black (walls and furniture), which gives a lot of weight.  Otherwise, there really wasn't much decor, just enough to soften the edges and anchor the darkness.  I should mention that when we went, the place was pretty empty, though we usually dine out on the early side of the evening.  Still, it didn't feel overly empty.  It was pretty peaceful, which I enjoyed that night.  For the amount we spend (including the purchase value of the Groupon, not just what we paid for it) we felt the money was well spent.  Not only this, but we would definitely return.

Tufesa.  Oh, Tufesa.  First of all, I admire their gusto and enthusiasm for the website that touts ticket purchasing capabilities...that doesn't work.  So, since we couldn't buy online, we headed to the brick and mortar location.  We were able to purchase our tickets without a hitch and, my favorite part, when we told the attendant about the website glitches they responded "Oh, yeah, it doesn't work."  Love it.  Really, it makes me laugh.  Now, that was buying a ticket (and quite affordable I must say).  When it actually came down to travelling with Tufesa, we enjoyed a relatively smooth ride.  We purchased the regular economy tickets, and took advantage of the student discount.  While I don't really have any "cons" there were a few "hmmms."  So, I'll list those and the "pros."  Keep in mind, both our trips were night rides.  Pros The buses + were reasonably comfortable and clean + had outlets available next to each seat + The bus stations were conveniently located (for us) + Soft lighting was used to wake up passengers when necessary  Hmmms - On our departing trip, the attendant inside took our ticket stubs, which the bus attendant asked for when we boarded... - The driver on our way back, for a portion of the trip, played music, loud enough that we could hear it halfway back... - We couldn't find the outlets on the departing bus, but we did on the returning bus.  I would totally use Tufesa again, though mostly to travel into Mexico again.  That saves me the need to get auto insurance across the boarder, and I personally hate driving :)  The night buses were sleep-able and it made the travel time a minimal detraction from the trip as a whole.

We took advantage of the Phoenix Public Library's Culture Pass and enjoyed free admission to this historic site (though for $7.50 it would be worth it, too).  We had a wonderful, wonderful tour with a volunteer (Gayle), who really made the tour for us.  We had an ample supply of questions and she never hesitated to answer them.  She had a wealth of knowledge and answered almost all of our inquiries about the house.  The house is beautifully restored and it's interesting to step back in time and learn about the lives of the wealthy in the years around the dawn of the 20th Century.  Who knew even wealthy women only usually had 3-4 outfits for a whole year!  Checking this off my Phoenix bucket-list was definitely a choice well made.  And time well spent!  If you're into history at all, this is a worthwhile choice - especially if you have a tour guide like ours!

I'm a shameless lover of Costco.   And this review is more a general review, but I'll add some specifics, as this is where we shop.  As I understand it, their business model is a shining example of equality and worker appreciation.  I wish more businesses would follow their example.  Anyways, that's a bigger picture thing than is really relevant to my review.  Aside from the company as an entity, Costco offers great products with an excellent promise of customer satisfaction.  You buy it, you don't like it, even if you've eaten/opened it, you can return it for a full refund.  Costco really values its customers.  And very rarely have we purchased anything we didn't enjoy.  I have one general observation and one complaint, that go hand in hand.  Costco's products sometimes seem to fade out, as in disappear from the shelves.  It seems that this is due to two factors - either they're not stocking it currently (or ever again) or they've moved it to another shelf/aisle.  Now, if it's gone, that sucks, but that's life.  If it's just been moved...that can present a problem because it is so difficult to find someone to ask.  This is consistent with any Costco I have visited; there are plenty of sample table workers, but any time I've asked they remind me that they're not Costco employees, and don't know.  So, if anything, I'd like for that to change.  At present, they'll ask you at check-out if you had trouble finding anything, and then they'll hunt it down for you -- but at that point, I want to be done.  (So four stars as a company)  Specific to this location, as others have mentioned, this is the only Costco I've ever seen that does not stand alone.  It's not a problem, but, when you're looking for it, remember that this is a Costco attached to a larger mall.  Parking is all right.  There's a narrow strip of parking (maybe 5 or 6 rows) directly next to the entrance, but that opens up into a much larger parking lot, you'll just have further to walk if you park there.  Finally, and maybe this is regional rather than store specific, but this location has the worst masses of people around the sample tables that I've seen.  I know they're a draw for many, but ten people waiting around the table, blocking the aisle, just gets old. (And four stars as a location)

I came here the day after Thanksgiving, having been informed by a coworker of their Black Friday promotion.  The cost was pretty awesome with the deal for the day.  This was my first experience on a climbing wall and the staff here were great at equipping and preparing us for our first experience.  I loved it, so much that I want to continue climbing.  They also have two auto belay devices, so you can climb in two locations without a buddy (I'd love to know if they have a means of connecting solo climbers with a belay partner).  For me, Ape Index is not a viable option as it's a pretty great distance from my home, otherwise I'd definitely look more into coming here.

Disclaimer: I have not been to the restaurant!  Now, one thing that I do is plan.  I plan parties; I plan dinners and brunches; I plan outings.  Halo-Halo Kitchen does not seem to work well with this practice.  Firstly, when attempting to make a reservation for our party, we were told reservations could only be made two days in advance.  Really?  I mean, yes, that's something, but what good is a two day reservation as opposed to just showing up?  If I can't make solid plans, at least a week in advance, then it's not worth my anticipation.  Despite the refusal to accept reservations outside of 48 hours in advance, we decided to hold our breath and set a night for dinner and karaoke.  Well, while eagerly awaiting Karaoke night, we called to make our reservation and, apparently, the "EVERY Friday Karaoke" isn't actually _every_ Friday.  So, the date that we've set aside and arranged with friends for the past two weeks has come to a startling halt.  Our much anticipated Karaoke night is no more.  While I'd still love to try the food, do not make plans based on Halo-Halo kitchen unless you like the rush of everything possibly falling apart!

Not all Asian markets are made equal.  Tan Phat is no exception.  And we have not been impressed by this store...sadly, too, as it's so close to home.  Here's the run down.  The organization of the store is fine.  At one end they have large refrigerators (maybe freezers?) and kitchen tools/dining supplies.  At the other they have produce.  Along the back wall they have a variety of fresh meats.  I'll admit, we've bought very little here, though partly because we were unable to FIND what we were looking for.  Everything in between seems to be organized by categories, some very specific some very broad: there's an aisle for rice noodles, almost exclusively, and another for Indian products.  While the store is pretty large (two or three times the size of our favorite little Viet store back in Utah), the selection seems to be pretty sparse.  The shelves have a lot of the same taking up a lot of the space.  We have tried to find flat broad wheat noodles (which seem to be hard to find in Phoenix, to be fair) and Hon-dashi, both to no avail.  We also were unable to find anything but soft tofu on one visit.  I think the biggest hang up for me, just before the lack of merchandise, is the difficulty we've had in communicating with the staff.  While I'm by no means an ardent believer of "In Murica we speak English!" I feel that if you're going to open a business that does draw a diverse clientele (I've seen others of various backgrounds, who also don't speak Vietnamese) it's important to expand your vocabulary enough to meet the needs and answer the questions of patrons.  This does not appear to be a priority for this business, and, as such, we're willing to make the drive to LF Market on Bell Rd instead.  I've also noticed others mention the cleanliness of the store and, well, I don't really care, to be honest.  I've noticed lots of stores similar to Tan Phat are comparably dingy.  It's not a priority for me, though.  I actually kind of like that feel over the sterilized feeling in most American grocery stores.  Now, if you speak Vietnamese, and your wants are within their stock, by all means, come here.  We still do, sometimes, but it's certainly _not_ our go-to store.

I'm somewhere between novice and expert (leaning towards novice) when it comes to body modification.  I've done my homework and had my fair share of needles in, on and through my skin.  The time came, last year, for me to pursue my first large tattoo job (a beautiful Chinese style tiger).  After having a less satisfying experience with my first ink, I was ready to really do the leg work and find both an artist and studio that I _wanted_ to work with.  I found three - two in Phoenix and one in Glendale - that seemed to have something in line with what I wanted.  The first place I visited was clearly not what I was looking for.  The second seemed like it was the one.  But then...then...I met Heather and spent a few moments in Lady Luck Tattoo.  Let's just say the rest is history.  But why here, why Heather you ask?  Well, first off, I've never felt so comfortable in a tattoo shop.  Honestly, completely, this place is peaceful and cozy.  Most places I've visited feel so...cold and abrasive.  Not here, not Lady Luck.  The decor is eclectic and colorful, the layout and furniture make it feel almost like home.  That was a big factor.  And each station is setup with a TV for mid-tattoo entertainment (they've got a vast DVD collection to boot).  And Heather's demeanor and personality echo those same feelings.  She really made me comfortable and at ease - at least between the bouts of needles on my ribs...#$*@!.  Now, second (only because I spoke with other artists who had great work), I chose Heather because her work is awesome.  I'm so pleased with my tiger.  Her style and technique was perfect for my piece.  Her portfolio is extensive and diverse, and has decades of experience to boot.  I really can't think of a way I could have had a better experience.  Not only would I recommend Lady Luck, but I already do to my friends considering tattoos.  If nothing else, at least pay them a visit.

So, I've only been here once thus far, but I'm so glad I came.  First impressions are good.  The focus here is certainly on the food.  Similar to Mi Maxim, the decor is minimal; the restaurant is setup to be functional, more like an eatery than a restaurant.  Which I don't mind _at all_ when the food is good and affordable.  Check and check.  I tried a dish unfamiliar to me: Canh Chua Chay.  It was delicious.  I loved the abundance of veggies.  Add some soy sauce and chili paste...mmmmm!  The spring rolls (vegetarian) where a little dry, but not bad.  Service was all right.  The server was prompt to ask if we were ready to order...like 1-2 minutes prompt.  We needed more time and he was more timely in his return.  We later asked for water and were provided with a big pitcher (a giant, blue, plastic mason jar to be specific).  Afterwards, we really didn't see him.  We did end up getting his attention to find out that we just pay at the counter, using our table number (posted on the edge of the table; 6A for us).  Seeing as this place is only a mile from my front door, I hope to walk over sometime when the asphalt isn't molten anymore and dine again!

Picture this: first year teacher with NOTHING.  No books, no supplies, no craft materials.  I could go on.  Now mix in a healthy dose of fear and anxiety.  That makes for a big mess.  Now, bring Treasures for Teachers into the picture.  While they might not fix my first year jitters, they proved to be an amazing resource for teachers, especially a first year teacher.  My favorite feature of this lovely establishment is their $5 bags.  There is an ample selection of items eligible for this offer. First and foremost for me: books.  I bumped up my classroom library to a few dozen books to over 200 books almost exclusively through the help of T4T with and only spent around $20-30 out of pocket.  Yes, that doesn't factor in the annual membership fee of $35, but so much else came out of that fee that it hardly seems appropriate to bundle that all in with the books.  My second favorite feature would have to be the free materials offered to teachers.  Twice in my first year I received a bounty of supplies for my classroom, once from Yoobi and once from a Target affiliate.  Whether you have a class of 10 or 30 the materials make a difference.  Each time, they were very appreciated by my kids.  There are other great features: the affordable materials, the bins of craft supplies, the discounted posters...so much!  This establishment is an asset to our teaching community and really does put teachers first.

We visited Caribbean Spice recently with an acquaintance and a large group of volunteers...it was a bit of a drive for us, but I was quite impressed by the service here.  The menu was clear and easy to read.  The selection was diverse but not overwhelming.  Prices were fair.  I ordered the jerk tofu plate and enjoyed the meal.  We arrived pretty late in the evening, so there weren't too many people there, but we were treated very well.  What was stand out was just how well we were treated.  We were a large party (I think 10 folks?) and it took a little while for our food to come out.  Understood.  Well, the woman working in back, preparing all our smoothies (which were yummy) ended up giving my partner and I "the excess" which amounted to about 1 1/2 portions.  She also brought out the extra from another smoothie to someone who hadn't even ordered one.  That's good practice in my book.  I'd definitely come back, especially knowing that they have a few good vegetarian options.

I'm not surprised there are so many yelp reviews on here.  The owner really, really pushes hard for people to yelp about them.  He made at least two pitches for people to post.  And here I am.  Successful he is, it appears.  Usually I don't review places with so many previous posts (I feel like after a while, it's just a lot of noise, unless the quality slides or something else changes dramatically).  But I did really enjoy our evening here.  In total we saw 6 comics, including the host and owner.  It seemed the comic quality was setup to start lame and improve from there.  I would say #6 (the headliner, Mary Mack) was the best, but #3-5 (including the owner) were also pretty good.  Overall, I as satisfied with the experience, and if that was maintained, I'd be happy to return.  We purchased a very reasonably priced Groupon to afford our evening.  Without that, we certainly wouldn't drink much ($10 cocktails, $6 beer on tap), and we may or may not eat again.  We ordered one dessert in addition to the Groupon included popcorn and drinks.  It was good, but seemed small for $6.50...Still, we didn't go for the food, so the fact that it's pricey doesn't really say much.  If you want to eat dinner here, it will be expensive (when compared to my ideal $20 for two budget).  Our server was friendly and made frequent rounds, so we never felt neglected.  She answered our questions and brought what we ordered.  Happy face.  Ultimately, if I can help it, I'll be here again.

I've bowled here twice and have really enjoyed the experience.  Lucky Strike has definitely take an old kind of grungy tradition and given it new life.  As many have mentioned, the environment is very much a lounge feel.  It's fun and feels much cooler than any other lanes I've visited.  I've seen others mention the on screen sports and I would definitely add my vote to playing music videos, or something akin to that, instead.  It's not a sports bar, right?  They do have a great selection of happy hour snacks and sips.  I don't generally try to go out exclusively in the evening, so if you don't mind going out earlier for happy hour, it's definitely worth it.  Lots of tasty snacks and cheap drinks.  The fried macaroni bites were quite good, as is the flat bread pizza.  Now, when we went, as it was early, I guess there were kids around, and they wouldn't post our "creative" bowling names (Sticky Rice Ballz, Fire Crotch, etc.).  So, for better or worse, it's a family conscious environment.  Service on the whole was pretty good, though it seemed our waitress was sometimes absentee, and they weren't very busy.  Overall, I'd go back with friends.

We've been to Bliss ReBAR twice now, both times for brunch.  I love the venue, and it's in a great neighborhood - lots of street art, murals and galleries.  I don't know if this building was something else before (though I definitely get that impression), either way it's a beautiful building.  Service has been fine.  The first time I simply don't recall, so nothing notable. The second time was kind of mixed.  We made reservations for New Year's Day.  Upon arrival we were told to sit anywhere.  That seemed weird; clearly our reservation was irrelevant (that noted, it seemed similarly unnecessary the first time, though we still "checked-in"). Beyond that, there weren't even tables available for the party -- fortunately, one couple ended up being absent for brunch.  It then took quite a while for our order to be taken.  Once that happened, service was good, if not great.  Our table was well tended and there were multiple wait staff who checked in on us; some were especially friendly, in the good way.  The cost is good.  The food is good.  I would say both are in step with each other.  It's not super cheap, but neither is the food.  You pay for what you get, and you definitely don't overpay, which I appreciate.  They also have an interesting selection of items on their menu (e.g. breakfast nachos), with options for everyone in the rainbow of selective eaters.  We'll definitely keep this establishment in mind, and maybe we'll give it a shot for drinks or something else next time.

I won't say much as, well, it's all been said.  Here's what I have observed:  - expect a line (but it moves pretty quickly, and if you're with friends anyways, well, it doesn't really matter) - try as many flavors as you like! (so delicious and rich AND they use metal sample spoons, which they wash and reuse *heart*) - they have a variety of cones, pretzel being one I hadn't seen before - one scoop is large and you can split it between two flavors - indulge and enjoy!

I don't give out many 5 star reviews, but my experience with Heart Savers was excellent.  In order to gain a certain job, I needed to get CPR, First Aid and Title IX training.  Heart Savers was one recommended agency...and they had it all.  Now, the trainings in themselves were straightforward and not _too_ painful :)  I really enjoyed our trainer, Tim, and his humor.  He made it palatable and seemed to have his heart in the right place, so to speak.  The organization with which I was attempting to gain employment also had a relationship with Heart Savers, and thus also a discount.  So the cost, overall, was competitive.  Now, all that alone would have merited 4 stars.  Where they really earned their fifth star was in customer service.  Apparently quite the opposite of the experience of others, I enjoyed accommodating, pleasant interactions with staff.  I made my initial enrollment without a hitch...but then I reconsidered and wanted to switch classes around.  I contacted the office and worked with a staff member (I want to say...Gennifer?) via e-mail to adjust the days. No problem!  Well, I didn't realize that the different date for one class also meant a different site.  Lo and behold, I arrive at their Glendale location to find that...no class here!  Distraught and frustrated, I figured out the mistake I'd made and again reached out to Gennifer, for a second (and final) adjustment to my enrollment.  Well, it wasn't a problem and Gennifer simply transferred me to an upcoming class.  No additional cost, no hassle.  With my experience, I would definitely recommend Heart Savers.

We visited The Nash for a free ASU student performance.  It was great.  It was free!  The venue is pretty low key and located in a great part of town.  I really wish we'd visited earlier than we did, as we'd definitely return, were we not moving out of town.  I can't really speak to the service, as there wasn't any.  Well...other than the phone call I received after leaving a message.  THAT was great -- they called back promptly and left me a message with the answer to my question.  I imagine ticketed events are probably a little more involved, as they have a drink menu, at least.  If you're thinking about visiting, I'd suggest it.

This place intrigues me.  The reason I first went was because of the blaring "Mexican Sushi" sign.  And I was hungry.  And hot.  The first time I actually didn't try a sushi roll (tight on cash...blame teachers' salaries).  I enjoyed some shrimp tacos (limited options for a pescatarian, unfortunately) and a cup of elote!  It was delicious.  Lots of salsas at the condiment bar, too.  The second time I did order some sushi, though I forget which roll.  I also had a cocktail de camaron, which was super yum.  The sushi was OK.  I didn't see how it was "Mexican," though it was fried and a little heavy on the cream cheese.  I'd like to try another.  Next time.    Service, over the course of two visits, was fine.  They took my order and brought my food to the table.  That's about as far as it went.  Price is pretty good, too.  A dollar or two less would be nice, but as is is totally fair :)  Environment is almost nil.  There are neutral colored walls and floors with relatively nondescript seating.  The one thing that does stand out is the counter of Mexican candies next to the cash register.  This place is a mile away, so next time it's not over 90 and I have some money, I'll hit them up again.

I just reviewed another Goodwill location (off 7th Ave and Indian School).  Again, I won't go into much depth here as my prime concern with second hand shopping is selection.  The thrill is in the chase and never quite knowing what you'll end up with.  I personally don't care much about the cleanliness or customer service here, as neither really get in my way.  I will say that the staff I have engaged with here have been friendly and helpful.  This store has what I want and that's selection.  More than any other I've visited in the valley (probably 5 or 6 other stores).  While I may not always leave with what I hoped for, I'm generally pleased with the amount of options I have.  They have a great children's clothing selection and a good stock of books and men's clothing.  While I find Saver's (on Bethany Home and 19th Ave) to be a better option when looking for kitchen electronics, household goods are pretty plentiful here -- I've even found glasses for the set that we already own.  This is where we come back to, especially on 50% off Saturdays!

Sometimes you buy a groupon and then you accidentally don't use it your first try.  So you come back.  That happens.  It happened.  With my two visits to La Santisima, I'd say they know what they're doing.  The offer some dishes that were new to me.  Lonches, for one.  I know what lonche is in Spanglish practice, but what_a_ lonche is, was news to me.  And it was good news.  All around, the food was good.  Salsas are even better.  I did order horchata my first time...but I've totally forgotten what that was like.  That seems to have happened to much of what happened during my first year on the job.  This isn't the only thing I've forgotten.  I've blocked out a lot, apparently.  The service was fine.  I've never seen the place hoping, but maybe the weekend dinner crowd is bashful or something.  Our water cups stayed pretty full and our server was otherwise attentive.  The wait for food was never long.  Cost was fine. It is a gourmet taco shop, after all, so you get what you pay for.  Portions are not huge and style comes with a cost.  The decor is lovely.  I could steal some of their paintings for home, I like them so much.  That is, if they weren't so darn big.  I'd likely give it another visit, that is if we're in Glendale downtown, just walking around, or something.  It seems to be one of the best options.

Such an interesting combination of cuisines.  Who knew you could successfully sell donuts, fried chicken AND ramen all under one roof.  It seems to be just what Welcome Chicken + Donuts is doing.  The venue is tidy and trendy.  The photography in the indoor dining area gives it a homey flair.  The wooden benches and tables outside give the outdoor dining area a rustic, picnic-y feel.  The cost is a little bit higher than you might pay elsewhere, but the business seems pretty passionate about its ingredients, their origins and quality, so it would seem that you're paying for food that's higher caliber than that found in cheaper venues.  Overall, the cost isn't prohibitive, and only pinches the wallet a bit more.  The food was good.  I tried the chipotle limon doughnut, which proved to be an interesting flavor combination.  I also ate the vegan ramen -- and upon ordering they asked if I'd like the marinated egg which I thought was ironic (and I did choose to add it on).  The ramen was good.  There were bites of sweet with mildly salty noodles and other vegetables.  I probably would have added some fish sauce or soy sauce, had it been on hand.  No one in our party, coincidentally, ordered chicken, so I can't speak to that, but everyone seemed pleased with their donuts and ramen.  I still can't get over that pairing...but it works!  I'd definitely come back here, but probably for the donuts, not the ramen.  Like, I actually might come back for the donuts before I move.  I want to try 'em all!

I come to Goodwill with a general idea of what I'd like to find, never a set idea on what I'm going to take home.  That generally works if there is selection.  While this location is clean and convenient, I was pretty disappointed by the selection.  I looked at books, children's toys and children's clothes on my last visit and all were pretty week.  The clothing especially was pretty limited.  This may be due to how recently it opened (I believe in the last year), but I don't know how distribution works for Goodwill.  Still, staff seemed helpful (in exchanges I observed) and the location is clean, possibly due to how new it is and it's location in the Melrose district.  Whatever the case, I'm giving it two stars because the most important thing for me, beyond cleanliness and customer service (for which I have very low expectations of both), is selection, which this location lacks.

So this place was awesome.  It's been a while since I've eaten Ethiopian, and every time I eat it I wonder why I let anything get in between me and this delicious cuisine.  My favorite thing about Ethiopian, aside from the communal dining style, is the intentional and delicious vegetarian options.  We ordered a vegetarian combination (the Abyssinian Vegetarian) and a meat dish.  For four hungry adults we cashed out at about $40.  I also had the Ethiopian tea, which was new to me, and not a favorite, but glad I tried it nonetheless.  Now, while the food was good, the service was exceptional.  One in our party has a strong gluten intolerance.  He called ahead and the restaurant made a special gluten free injera for him.  Once we had arrived and ordered, they brought out and explained the unique injera they had prepared, no extra cost.  They also indicated that, given more advance notice (a few days) they'd be able to prepare it another way...maybe better?  I wasn't clear on the distinctions.  Still, they were very accommodating.  They also helped us decide on what menu items to order.  I hope to return here.  I was very pleased.  Unlike the two-star reviews left for Abyssinia, we were well fed and satisfied.

I've been here once and visited the Tempe location twice.  Since my most recent visit was here (and I only review franchises once), I thought I'd give Phoenix my shout-out.  First off, I really like the ideology behind MAD Greens (having hear it directly from the founders, I'm confident we're on the same page).  I like the fact that they focus on freshness and flavor.  I really like that they source what they can locally.  That's so commendable (though it really should just be standard practice...oh, capitalism/consumerism). In my visits, I've always found their food to be both flavorful and fresh.  MAD Greens makes dining out as a mixed dietary-needs couple very manageable.  Not only that, but there is no challenge in finding healthy options.  So, if you're looking for fresh vegetables and something for both the omnivore and vegetarian (or even vegan), then MAD Greens is a great choice.  As to service and price, we've never had any troubles with either.  I've always felt service was friendly and appropriate.  We've also never had any problems with our orders, though I'm confident that they would be easily resolved (especially with the very responsive management, evident on this yelp page).  As to cost, I feel it's fair.  For fresh food, you're going to pay slightly more, and that's the case here, too, Now, with that, I've always left full, and the bill hasn't hung as a regret in my mind.  Specific to this location, parking is an issue, but so it is for any place in this area.  It's a popular spot, so parking is also "popular" :)  Just don't give up -- you'll find a spot somewhere!  If you haven't tried it yet, give it a shot.  MAD Greens has my recommendation!
