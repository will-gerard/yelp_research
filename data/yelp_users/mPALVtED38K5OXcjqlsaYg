Amazing. Just amazing.  In a world of absolutely gigantic monstrosities that look towards serving an insane amount of people, I found a place that goes in the other direction. Quality over quantity isn't just a motto, it's a business practice.   In one of my favorite districts, heritage square; the food and service provided here are of the utmost quality. Not because any one particular thing is mind blowing but because everything is done so well that cynics are left to try really hard to nitpick. And as a cynic, I failed.  This is a place that everything from the ambiance down to the people is so cohesive and enjoyable. It's a must visit if you can get in. Which may be the only problem, but how can you blame them when people never want to leave.

I love the tacos here. Taco Tuesday is awesome and I love to go here but there is always lack luster customer service. Tonight was especially awful. The bartenders were all on their phone and I found out that the bartender (Joe) had named our tab, which he should have had split; children.   What was turning into a weekly trip for tacos is now the last time I'll ever set foot in a loco patron and I'll advise my friends to go elsewhere.  As far as the neglect from the people working there, it's guaranteed to happen.

I love this place. Good food regardless of what time you go but breakfast is definitely the time they shine. I get French toast when I go but for lunch I got the Mac and Cheese for lunch.    Great service and great food

Every time I go here, the service is awesome and the environment is just so fun. This place makes you feel at home and the hair cuts are always on point. While people say it's a little pricey, the cost is on point for the professional service.   I'm going to go there every time I need a hair cut and I know that I'm going to get some awesome service

Sip is the coffee/bar every person wishes they have. You blink and you're part of the family and you don't want to go anywhere else.  The bar is really strong for being a coffee bar. The drinks are everything you would want and expect from a locally focused establishment.  The coffee is great too! While I'm not the biggest coffee fiend, I don't feel guilty getting some caffeine here.  The most important part of this whole operation is the staff. They treat you like family first and make you a friend afterwards. Definitely a place I'll frequent while I live in Arizona. Top 5 places for me.

Coming from Pizzeria Bianco, the trend continues of small, muscular operations that continue to be so impressive.   This places is an absolutely tucked away gem. The coffee is absolutely wonderful and a great reminder of what you can get outside of the chain restaurants.   On top of that, the ambiance is wonderful. Great music and great feel for how small the shop is. The shop is illuminated mostly by natural light which is absolutely fantastic.   The only downside, no bathroom. This coffee shop is definitely a stop in and leave after grabbing a drink. Not a terrible thing considering how small and lean the shop is but I prefer to hang out all day at whatever coffee shop I go to and that becomes difficult when you have to figure out another option.  Also: locked wifi. Didn't ask for the password so shame on me but just having open Wifi or the password visible would have been nice. I'm nitpicking at this point but that shows how awesome this place is.

Ike's is the sandwich shop that's just a wee bit too expensive to be a daily dive. The sandwiches are great. The menu is ridiculously awesome and you will find something you like but ten bucks for a sandwich and drink makes me feel unhappy the next day talking to my friends about it.  YOU SHOULD STILL GO. The place is good but just don't plan on going too often
