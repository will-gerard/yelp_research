Taking my dog Keeton to Canine Preferred doggie day care has been the best thing for me while I'm in school. Keeton absolutely loves going here twice a week and has the best time with the other dogs. It makes me happy knowing he is in such good hands during the day. I would definitely recommend anyone looking for a doggie day care to go here!

I am extremely disappointed in the quality of service and the poor customer service from Steve at his establishment in Mesa. I paid $1,000 to get my Lexus IS 250 two front seats reupholstered and I wish I never even touched them. They looked better before than they do now. After a month I had to go back and have him fix the seats because they weren't done properly at all. They weren't even reupholstered, he used a cheap dye that just rubbed off. And now the same thing is happening again!! I would never recommend anyone to go here. I wish I could go back in time and never did this. Big mistake. Huge mistake on my part.

I had an excellent experience at Dr. Hobgoods office! Dr. Hobgood is the best guy and surgeon! I couldn't be happier with my results. The girls up at the front desk are so nice and friendly and Dr. Hobgoods assistant Kiley is awesome! I was treated so well there and everyone went above and beyond to help me.

Rude, all I have to say is everyone who works at this location is very rude and very disrespectful, especially Tyler and most of all Charlene. I was almost in tears after the way she spoke to me. All I was trying to do was find out where my driver was since its was taking 45 minutes to get my sandwich and I only live 0.8 miles away. After 2.5 years of having deliveries made to me, they all of sudden won't deliver 20 feet further to the Optima CamelView because it's "out of their delivery zone" which is across the street from the Harkins/Macy's parking lot, which is in their delivery zone. The delivery man, who is the nicest man btw, thinks this was BS also because he has delivered to me many times and explained to me they even sometimes make deals with people and deliver to even further places. He also mentioned sometimes Tyler (who is the shift manager) just sometimes decides not to deliver certain places because "he just doesn't feel like it".  I will be contacting corporate tomorrow to file another complaint on this location. It's so sad that people can behave this way.

Emily Tryon is awesome! I highly recommend her for any injectables you are considering. She was very knowledge and thorough during my visits. She goes over every detail with you so you never feel uncertain about anything. She's excellent at her job but also a very sweet person and very easy to get along with.

I absolutely loved my facial treatment that I received at Skin Magic. I had such a wonderful experience from start to finish and I will defiantly be coming back to see Jessica!
