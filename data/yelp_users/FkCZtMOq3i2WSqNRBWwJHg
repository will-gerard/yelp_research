Terrible, this place is a joke the service is terrible the food is not fresh.. The food takes forever, they brought out our entree first and our appetizers last and we had to wait for our drinks for 20 mins.. If this tell the owners anything, I hope it's helps and is taken only constructively!

Food made both my boyfriend and I sick we called the next day, and the manager was so rude, she basically flat said your lying and not to back if we had a problem with the food and how it sat with us.
