I love Arizona Best Real Estate.  This is a class act Realty Company in Arizona that offers so much more than so many of the outfits out there today who are just trying to collect as many desk fees as possible.  The Broker, David MacIntyre is a hands on Broker who runs weekly agent/staff meetings to keep his team abreast of the lates market trends, technology and market psychology so that his agents can best serve their buyers and sellers.  He is genuinely concerned about each of his agents and know them all by name.  Many of them have been with the company for a decade or more and there is very little turnover.  We have had the honor and privilege of working with many of the agents in the office and it is extremely apparent that the office culture that Mr. MacIntyre has created attracts the very best agents.

Very unimpressed. Salad was stale and drenched with dressing, wings were gross. Not going back.

I had the pleasure of working with Joshua Hill last month on a purchase transaction and was extremely impressed with his level of professionalism and overall care he exhibited for our client. I work with many Realtors and can tell you that Joshua stood out from most of them with his attitude and competence. Thank you for doing great work, Joshua!

The one star is because of the food being awesome, assuming you can get served and that they haven't run out of staples like fries, tater tots, and onion rings. I'm not making this up! After waiting 46 minutes for our beers (which were never brought to our table), we decided to leave. We told the waitress why we were leaving and there was no apology given, no sorry, no nothing. Clearly, they are lacking management. Sad. The food is great but the service was non-existent. Can't believe they spent all that money remodeling, only to lose our party of 8. Wonder how many others left. As we were leaving, another table said they had been there an hour without much progress either. We went to Chipotle across the parking lot and ate without effort or hassle. Yea Chipotle!!

I've know Sandy and Rob for years and can say without hesitation that they are two of the most knowledgeable and trustworthy real estate agents I know. No BS from them...they tell you the truth and run their business with their clients interest first.

This place was delicious. Perfect date night location and service was great. Definitely coming back! EVO salad with shrimp, fried risotto balls, and mini donuts for desert...yum.

I loved this place when i was last there...a few months ago. Great burgers. I have since gone vegetarian and was looking forward to trying their veggie burger last night but when I got there at 5:30pm, they were out of veggie burgers - ? I was pretty bummed. The manager gave me a 10% discount on my next visit. So, I guess they handled it, sort of. Nice people, but I was still bummed.

As a big fan of PJ for the past decade, it pains me to say that my experience tonight at their newest location was bad. Not just so-so or meh, but bad.   First off, they had multiple tables open but refrained from seating us because there were 9 of us in our party. We said we would split into two table but we were told even if we did that, they didn't want to overload their kitchen, If seating two tables will overload the kitchen, then you've got kitchen issues.  Secondly, we waited over an hour for our food. We watched other tables get seated after we were, receive their food, and finish before we were served. I know they usually have their food out fast, like in 5 to 10 minutes so to wait over an hour was a disappointment to say the least. When I did receive my meal, it tasted like it had been sitting under heat lamps, which it likely had been for a long time.  I know this is a new location, but I sure hope they get their kinks worked out because this evening's experience was.....bad.  As a consolation, the decor is nice and the hostesses were very nice.
