The Golden Nugget is my favorite hotel in Las Vegas.  It's the best bang for your buck.  I booked the room on Travelocity this time and even got the third night free.  Score!  The water slide through the shark pool is awesome.  I can't count how many times I flew down it.  The only thing keeping me from giving the Golden Nugget a solid 5 stars is the customer service is really lacking.  I don't even know why the concierge gets to have a "Concierge" sign in front of her because she's useless.  Can someone cough up a few hundred dollars and at least give her a computer so she can Google answers for us?

This review is specifically for the free Mystic Falls Park show.  The Mystic Falls Park show is daily at 2:00 p.m., 6:00 p.m., 8:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m.  I called to ask them if it was a typo and they actually have a 4:00 show but they don't.  They also didn't know why there wasn't one.  Anyways, I really liked the show.  It has the water shooting up like the Bellagio but on a much, much smaller scale.  So much smaller that you can stand on a bridge literally right in front of the water show.  There are colored laser lights and music.  If you are staying on the Strip and you'd like to catch another free show, I highly recommend checking out Sam's Town.  Just keep in mind it's a really, really long bus ride out there.  And if you do make the trek, make sure you check out Shelpers, the "World's Largest Western Store."  I had no idea there were so many cowboy-styled things in the world.  Like they had clothing for girls that was like Roxy but cowboy.  I swear!  Oh, and little cowboy boots for babies and little kids!

I love this show.  It was the most amazing show I have ever seen.  The only slight problem is that now I compare every show I see to this show and always end up thinking 'it wasn't as good as Mystere'.  Like nothing can come close.

I loved reading the other Yelp reviews because everyone was thinking along the same lines as me.  Holy crap, how is it that there is an ABC outside of Hawaii?  And how funny is it that they sell chocolate covered macadamia nuts?  They have this really cute cosmetics line called "Island Girl" with everything from lip glosses to scented cuticle oils.  ABC Stores are for bargain-hunting tourists and Hello Kitty lovers.

I had expected a lot more from a Cafe at the Bellagio.  I ordered the chicken wrap.  My chicken was a tad dry and the wrap was really boring.  My boyfriend had the tandoori chicken.  The tamarind chutney was absolutely delicious.  I wasn't impressed and I wouldn't go back.

This place was really, really nice.  Very classy.  My cousin and I started our morning off at their gym - it was nice and spacious.  They had lots of equipment and ample exercise machines.  I liked how the treadmills had tv screens built-in - I was able to get my celebrity gossip fix while I ran.  Watching Nicole and Paris inspired me to keep running to burn more fat.  There were lots of towels and a pretty good selection of juices.  We skipped breakfast so I had a few V8's to hold me over until after our massages when we could hit a buffet.  Gina was my massage girl and she was amazing.  She has a background in sports medicine and she knew her stuff.  She gave me advice on improving my posture and pointed out some of my trouble spots.  No one has ever done that for me before.

For what you pay, the Deuce is totally worth it.  If you are short on time and want to get to point A to point B as quickly as possible, the Deuce is not for you.  If you have two hours or more to get from one end of the strip to the other, the Deuce is the way to go.  The best seats are in the front row of the top deck.  For some reason, some of the buses have some sort of protective layer on the windows that ruins your pictures (I'm a picture taking machine) but the front seats don't have this.

Thank you, fellow Yelpers, for the awesome recommendation.  Capo's was a great experience.  I love the old mafia movie feel.  I agree with other Yelpers that the food is okay but the atmosphere is what really makes it a special experience.  I had the duck soup and the angel hair pasta pomodoro.  I don't think there was any duck in the soup but it was tasty.  The singer was great.  He sounded a lot like Frank Sinatra - at least to a non-expert like me.  My boyfriend and I didn't rent a car so we took the bus and it took quite awhile to get to Capo's.  So, if you decide to take the Deuce down and then catch another bus, keep in mind it's pretty far west from the Strip.

My first mistake was going to Qua first and then going to the Planet Hollywood Spa.  I should have reversed the order.  Qua set my expectations really high.  The first thing that upset me was that when I booked my reservation over the phone with Jodi, she told me it would cost $100 for an hour massage and that would include full access to the facility's amenities.  When we got there, the receptionist told us they don't offer a $100 massage so I had to be mistaken.  They said it was $135 - plus, they automatically include 18% gratuity.  When I asked to speak to Jodi, Jodi said she was positive she didn't quote me $100 because $100 is for another massage, not a deep tissue.  This contradicted what the first girl said because she said they didn't even offer a $100 massage.  I asked to speak with her manager so she went looking for a manager but she was gone for quite awhile so I headed to the gym to start working out.  While I was running on the treadmill, three women in suits walked over to me.  It was a little awkward because they were dressed nicely and meanwhile sweat was pouring off my body.  Thanks to the coolrunning.com Couch-To-5k training program I've been following, I was not out of breath.  LOL - I SO did not mean to make that sound like a plug.  I explained the situation to them and the one main lady explained they don't have a $100 massage so there was no way I was quoted that figure.  I mentioned Jodi said there was a $100 massage and she said the only way a massage could get close to that price would be if I had a coupon.  They she asked me if I had a coupon and I said 'no' but I asked if she would honor the coupon discount for me given these circumstances.  She then said she couldn't because coupons are only good Monday through Friday and it was a Saturday.  I finally gave up and told them we would still get our massages because it was already getting late and I didn't want to have to search for another massage place.  The facilities were okay - keep in mind we had been to Qua the day before so I couldn't help but compare the two in my head.  My locker was really ghetto and I had a hard time opening it but finally one of the workers told me I needed to push hard on the door as I entered the number combination and after that it worked like a charm.  The deep tissue massage was good, the girl was really friendly and nice.  When I mentioned how the girl at Qua had given me some advice, she gave me some more tips on ways to improve my posture.

I stopped by here for breakfast on my way back from a run when I was staying at the Red Rock Resort.  It was clean and welcoming inside.  The workers were really friendly and didn't seem bothered when I forgot to get a receipt for expenses and went back and asked for one.

I feel awkward typing up this review because I thought for sure I'd be adding to the legions of 5 star reviews.  My boyfriend and I went to Envy Saturday night.  I really liked the decor.  I had the bone-in ribeye and the mac 'n cheese.  My boyfriend had the chicken.  After trying our respective dishes, we both came to the conclusion that there was something missing.  Admittedly, the ribeye was incredibly tender and the center part almost melted in my mouth.  I don't even know how to explain it other than to say it was bland.  I love mac 'n cheese but was disappointed by this one.  It tasted much too wine-y for me.  I don't like the taste of alcohol.  The workers were also a bit short with us.  I expected much better customer service.

If I could, I'd give Dunkin' Donuts way more than 5 stars.  I mean, hello, this is Dunkin' Donuts we are talking about!  I'm a poor, deprived Southern California girl who doesn't get to partake in the Dunkin' Donuts Boston Creme goodness all that often.  When I saw the signs on Fremont Street, I started screaming.  I had one Boston Creme donut a day.  Oh, yes, I did.  I love you, Dunkin' Donuts!

I saw Stephanie tonight at the Yelp Elite Beauty Bash at Benefit Cosmetics in Santa Monica.  I don't know if she was speaking to my spirit guides or if her spirit guides were able to tell her all those things about me but I couldn't believe how dead on she was with my reading.  She was truly amazing.  There have been some important decisions in my life that I've been struggling with and she gave me the clarity I needed.  Thank you so much, Stephanie!
