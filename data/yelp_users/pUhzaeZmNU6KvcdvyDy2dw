I always listen to this station. All the host are pretty entertaining... Bruce St. James and Mac and Gaydos are probably my favorite.... And who doesn't like Dave Ramsey?! I totally need to read his books... Then only thing i dislike about the station is the syndicated glenn beck show... He talks too much religion, But whatever.

The first time we came here the "seat yourself" sign was visible, so thats what we did. Fifteen minutes later, we left. No one ever came to greet us....   This time, we were set immeadiately and ordered some beers. Everything started out fine...    Some of the wings that came with our order were so over cooked, there was no meat left. They were the ones conveniently located at the bottom of the stack. Once we ordered our entrees, our server started coming around a lot less.... Our food took a while, it seemed. I ordered a burger, pretty basic, but when our server offered me a temp request I said medium. It came out over cooked, but still good. I hate being asked, then end up disappointed. The onion rings were delicious and my beer was AMAZING (White Russian Imperial Stout). Now, my husband order the red pepper pasta dish.... Starting off, the pasta was over cooked. The sauce was more like a butter sauce and hardly resembled red pepper anything. The green chili mac led me to the same disappointment, i just didn't think it was good (there is another place on 7th st... that green chili mac is delicious!). My husband and i both agreed the beer was great, he had the hefeweizen.  I really doubt we will return.

I love this place! I've been to this location several times and have yet to be disappointed. They have $5 glasses of wine until 5pm everyday (sangria on sundays) . The food is delicious!! Service is great and they always have good music playing!

My boyfriend and I went out on a thursday night for a last valentines day celebration at DPOV. Everything started off nice and were really enjoying the view and each other... The place started getting busier and our team of servers began stopping by less and less... By the time we had gotten our entrees they were pretty much nonexistent. Our food was just above Luke warm and our wine was empty.... After about 30 mins of waiting for some one to come over one of our servers came by to clear our plates. He didn't ask how our food was and didn't offer any dessert menus. We aren't really the complaining type but considering the price of the food my boyfriend got up to discuss our issues with the manager whom removed the entrees. This place really needs to improve their customer service skills. We decided to go to one of our favorite places for dessert. The  Rokerij. We won't return or recommend this place.

Came here for a quick bite to eat while my car was being worked on up the street.... Not one person acknowledged me. Sat at the bar for 10 mins before I had to ASK for a drink/menu.... There were 4 tables in the place. Not busy by any means. The old lady working was Incredibly rude to say the least. Margret was very nice, she could tell I was getting heated from sitting there and not being helped. I work in the industry therefore I'm a phenomenal tipper. All I wanted was a beer and a salad.... Going to gecko.  I visit the one in Chandler often, the food is delish and the staff is very attentive. I recommend going to that one. Don't waste ur money here.

As stated by the other yelpers... Worst Taco Bell ever. Drive threw takes forever... I order on the Taco Bell app, the women on the speaker confirmed my order. When I got to the pick up window, they hadn't even made my food yet. The very unprofessional young man was making comments to the people preparing my food "she's mad, hurry up" while the cooks were complaining they didn't see the order... The food was sloppy and one of my tacos had almost no meat in it. Thankfully this isn't my normal Taco Bell, I never have to come to this location again. I never have this problem on 3rd st! The only reason I resorted to a Yelp review is because I didn't get my receipt or a comment card. Coincidentally, my husband had come through the drive threw a few hours earlier, he got one.

Found a long dark hair in my cherry limeade when i went to empty the limes and cherries in my sink. I emailed corporate with no response. How can you not see that while making the drink! Never returning.

So... The BF and I decided to come here for a nice, relaxing pedicure about 11am one morning after a rough start to our day... We were greeted promptly and seated immediately. The place was kinda busy, several  people getting mani/pedi's. The first chair i sat in was great the massage options were helping me relax while my BF's pedi started. The bottom half of the chair wasn't working so she asked me to move to the other side. This chair sucked. The top half didn't work and the water was cold. I asked for her to turn up the temp, but she just smiled and nodded. It was barely warmer. I decided to just deal with it hoping my pedicure would start soon.... it didn't. I had to sit there and wait for my boyfriend to finish up before the same chick started working on my feet. There were a few other women getting pedicures that were in there before we were yet they weren't as far along as we were. She starts removing the nail polish from my pruned feet. This lady seriously spent 10 minutes rubbing my right foot and 5 mins on the left. My entire pedicure consist of 20 mins. The only reason we decided to go in there was because of "$15 pedicure" sign out front. Just want to go home, we went to pay, for 2 pedis i was charged $41. I'll pay $41 elsewhere. Worst pedicure of my life.

OMG!! This place is amazing! The boy and I came here for dinner on a whim one Monday night and the place was poppin! We grabbed a seat at a little table near the bar (the game was on). We started off with a bottle of riesling and a pepperoni pizza. The pizza was perfectly cooked and not too greasy and a crunchy crust. They have homemade lemon chello also amazing. I had the gnocchi for my entree. One of the best dishes I've ever had! It was perfect! Flavorful marinara and a sprig of basil. The boy had lasagna and I was a little concerned he was going to leave me for that dish! The entire experience was amazing. My new favorite restaurant!

I love coming to this place! The food is delicious and alway consistent! If your lucky enough to get a table out side u will have the pleasure of watching the private plans take off and land! Hopefully soon they will be able to expand so it isn't so crowed! Best breakfast spot in C-town. However the service isn't the best... But I've had worse at other Chandler hot spots...

This place was great! The service was good (we did hear another server complaining about her table right next to us, but whatever). The menu was unique and offered several options! The only thing was... it was a bit pricey... we did over hear other patrons complaining about the price of their drinks and take it out on the server by NOT tipping, well leaving her .75 on a 26 dollar tab. Classy. I would definetley return.

Boyfriend and I came here on whim... Just saw it had some decent reviews on yelp.  We chose to check out the bar area to see if we could grab a seat, since it was our 1st time we realized there were tables as well as a bar top. There wasn't enough space at the bar for the two of us, but there was a women who was attempting to squeeze us in... Come to find out she and the man next her were the owners. Now she was very accommodating however I hate seeing the people operating an establishment taking up space for potential customers. We grabbed a table sat there for a little over 5 mins before a server greeted us. The busser had been there twice before the server had come by. Annoying. We ordered a bottle of wine and a small pizza immediately. It took about 25 mins for that small pizza to arrive at our table, but not before we saw our server holding while she was talking to other tables ... Thanks for continuing to keep us waiting. The pizza was bland and had been sitting around for a while.  We order that rest of our food and some extra bread...... Our food just seemed to take forever. Salads came out... No bread. For $16 entrees the portions we quite small... I was actually surprised it came out hot! Home made pasta was really good I'll give them that, but the service was horrible. Our server was at the table behind us talking up a storm about some nonsense (considering she was working) we watched the hostess come Over an tell her another table was waiting on her to run their card. Lovely. She just continued doing what she doing... Never once checked on us during our meals. I've been in this industry far too  long to put up with stuff like this. Especially considering we eat the same meals a mile from where we live (homemade pasta included) with bigger portions, better service and a lower price.   However their bar does look very nice. I did like the decor a lot. They also have a huge wine selection.

All these yelpers couldn't be wrong! This place is deeeeelish! Some many different options, it's hard to choose a pastry. Not sure if u could go wrong on any of them.... The beer selection is pretty decent. The secret beer is a hazelnut brown ale (rogue brewery). It's not really a secret it's just not on the menu, but it's amazing. Normally im not a fan of rogue, but whatever. We had the banoffee for dessert! They whipped the cream as we ordered, it was perfect. The service was ok, we seemed to have 3 ppl serving us. The female was def. less attentive, but the boys were on point.This place is absolutely worth trying but don't expect any thing fancy. If they changed anything it would lose it's charm. Nothing else like it in az.

Came here because of a bad experience at florindinos... ( I should have known better) the food here is always amazing.  The staff is very attentive and the place was packed! (it's almost 2pm on a Wednesday!) my server was busy with larger parties but my drink was never empty! (Araceli) I've never had a bad experience here!

The thing I love about this place is that its simple. Sandwiches, salads, soups. Breakfast and Lunch. There menu is specific.... what comes on the meal and what health benefits (if any). They do not serve soda. Tea, lemonade and coffee. Staff was knowledgeable and quick. No complaints.

I used to love Quiznos.... I would go out of my way to get a turkey bacon guacamole sandwich any day. At this point in my life I will no long be giving any money to this sorry excuse for a sandwich shop. The staff is rude and careless. I was given obviously bad guacamole... Which I didn't realize until i got home a took a bite of my sandwich to have the fowl taste in my mouth. It took 20 mins to get my sandwich, there was only one couple in front me. I'm done with this place. I should have went to paradise bakery across the street.

I use CC regularly.... They are always there on time and easy to set up pick up and drop off times... They'll take u anywhere in the valley!! The drivers are always nice and dressed professional. One thing I've leave about living in AZ is that the no name cab drivers try to take advantage of u at ALL costs....

I've lived down the street from here for years... I can't believe this is my fist time here!   I get manis and pedis all over chandler and lately they have been pretty mediocre... On my way to the grocery store I decided I wanted me nails done. I walked in, picked my color and almost immediately sat in a massage chair. Great start! The chairs (from What i could tell) worked properly and the water was hot, but not too hot. My massage, sugar scrub and paraffin treatment was perfect and I didn't feel rushed. I may have to start being loyal a nail salon! Thanks guys!

My boyfriend and i came here on Sunday to watch the steelers preseason game against the broncos. We saw on the website that this was owed by a steelers fan. Our kind of people. We had planned on having a few drinks and checking out the menu...   First of all... we didn't receive much of a greeting. The bartender just kinda said "what are you drinkin?" no biggie it was clearly a shift change. The guy that came on to replace him didn't say anything to us until we needed another drink. I need a little bit of a personality from my bartenders, being in the industry that's how i get some of my best tips... We decided to try their little trio thing (cant remember what exactly it was called) the pico just tasted like diced tomatoes... no flavor what so ever. Same with the bean dip. Cheese and olives can only hide so much.. Now the menu said that the guac was fresh... being a lover of Mexican food there was no way that was fresh guacamole... and it was bland like the other items. While i was there i noticed that the bartender kept making shots and serving them to the old dude that was making the food.... Whatever. We put out order in quickly so he wasn't to intoxicated while making my dinner. I ordered the taco wrap. Everything i said about the trio applies here... Bland Bland Bland. My bf had the meat stack sandwich. He said it wasn't bad... it looked nasty i had no desire to even try it. The guy in the kitchen came out had a few more drinks and started chattin it up with the other people around (total of 4 others). This place is small and didn't have a good selection of beer or liquor... Maybe about 5 seats at the bar and 10. The bathroom was filthy. i cant say ill be back here...

My initial thoughts about this place were very positive.... We bought the livingsocial coupon. My boyfriend started off with one flight of the cabernet wines and one of the Riesling. Both wines were really good in my opinion. The cheese plate was pretty standard we had the cheddar and havarti. However the more time we spent there the less I was enjoying the place.... Service was starting to get slow....  I ordered the hand made pasta dish with Cajun alfredo sauce. The pasta was completely over cooked an the sauce was bland. Not worth the $18 I paid for it. The bf got the braised beef melt (not sure if thats the name) which was raved a out in an other review. Let's just say it wasn't very big and very greasy.... Nothing impressive about this place.... While we were waiting (forever) to pay our tab we over heard some staff members yelling at each other. Probably won't come up on my radar to return...

The hubs and I planned on meeting a friend to watch a hockey game on a Sunday evening. The bar was rather full... Just a few empty tables. The bar top was empty so we attempted to take a seat... The female bartender come up so fast and demanded my ID before I could even sit down! I realize i look young, but god damn! So just to be an ass I ordered a water. Seriously give me a minute.   Now, that entire experience had set the tone... We had to ask to order any thing... She would not check on us... Then she argued about a mistake she made! Her shirt was so worn her name was no longer visible  and the entire time we sat at her bar we didn't know her name. Since I was starving I order the poppers and a side salad. They brought the veggie platter, she rang in an $8 salad. When I clarified what i wanted she blamed the mistake on the kitchen (I could see on the screen what she had rang in). When my husband tried to justify the confusion, there is no $8 garden salad on the menu, she argued and was defensive. From that point we could hear her complaining about us to other employees! Classy. We again had to ask the manager for the side garden salad... He was told we didn't want it. WTF!!!!!! We eventually got the apology owed from the manager... Not our bartender. He did his best to rectify the situation, which is why we stayed.   She left with an attitude. John took over! He had one of those new shirts and a name tag! He did great! 5stars for john. When I ordered; he repeated and clarified my order. Everything met expectation, in the end. BWW isn't my favorite place to dine, but we were in a pinch... John was truly the saving grace tonight. Very knowledgable on menu items, cracking jokes and working hard. We gladly showed our appreciation in our tip tonight. He would be the only reason why we would return.   The poor rating on this review is directly connected to my experience with what's her name....

This place is fabulous! The food, the drinks, the decor, the service.... Minus one star because they were out of pozole soup. However we had the tecate skirt steak tacos, chipotle Caesar salad, Chorizo porchetta... Highly recommended. Definitely plan on returning for some pork shoulder tacos!

This place was amazing. Drinks, food, service. I had the pork tenderloin. It was perfect. Hubs had the filet. Also amazing. They make their own ginger ale or ginger beer (I can't remember which), but the bartender was making us "mule" type drinks, I would go back for the drinks alone.

TERRIBLE visit on Wednesday night... Walked in and both hostess just stared at me... No hello, no nothing! So I grabbed a seat at the bar. The bartender was actually great! But unfortunately for her, the lack of leadership from the management is causing the standard of Grimaldi to plummet. My pizza came out Luke warm and cheese barely melted.... I asked for it to be crispy. When the bartender asked if I wanted it fixed, I asked her to point out her manager... Guess who it was?!?! The same person who sent out my undercooked pizza!!! The younger women, who was in charge of the entire place, is sending out a sub par product. She did not even look the part of a manger... No professional attire, poor attitude and a clear lack of standards. Why would i have sent it back to get the same product?? No wonder the staff doesn't care, the manger doesn't! Unfortunately I won't be returning to Grimaldi's.

All these 5 star food reviews confuse me...   Hubs and I both thought the food bland and the staff lacked any customer service skills. I would prefer any of the "berto's" over regio's... Which isn't really a compliment know matter how you look at it.

Had my first Pittsburgh Willy's hotdog today... It was delicious!!! My boyfriend and I decided to go there for perogies, we didn't realize they only do them on Wednesdays now:( the owner was really nice and he actually offered to make them for us! Since it was my first time we decided to try out the dogs. I had the chili dog it was a huge hot dog cut in half on a bun covered with chili and cheese. My bf had the wild willy he was also pleased with his selection... However he did not offer me a bite! The place was really small but the atmosphere was great! Every square inch covered in steelers or steel town memorabilia!

My boyfriend had been bugging me to go to this place with him for months!!! We finally went...   It was a Saturday evening and the restaurant was dead. That is a really bad sign... We walked in and were awkwardly greeted by what seem to be a new hostess. We walked into the dining area and stood there for about 30 seconds while the hostess discussed where we should be seated with a server(?). Super.   I always get the same thing at steakhouses, but I was very curious about the menu. They have kangaroo, buffalo, elk etc. We ordered the chicken wings to start with since they had some sort of habanero sauce, but they were out... Of course. I cant imagine that the sauce is that difficult to make (assuming they make it, instead of purchasing it). We took our servers recommendation and tried the spicy Asian, nothing special.   I ordered the 6oz filet, medium, with a baked potato with the works and the boyfriend ordered the 8oz filet, medium, with garlic mashed. I had a Caesar salad to start with, it was fine... nothing special. I could have done with out the bottom of the barrel croutons though, too many crumbs! Boyfriend had the house salad with a  few additional items. He said it was fine. When my steak came, there were no juices on the plate indicating that it was still pink in the middle. I immediately cut into it and surprise, surprise it was completely cooked!  I love eating leather! So I glanced over at my boyfriends steak which was cooked perfectly. Great. I guess I was lucky since he had gravy on his plate that I was able to use so my steak wasn't so dry. I informed our server of the issue and she agreed the steak was over cooked. I have always had bad experiences with sending my food back to be re-made, so I don't. I expected a manger to come over and talk to us since the food is at a higher price range.... I was wrong. Our server (Brooke) was great! It didn't look like there was a single other person working in the restaurant! Any other staff member that was there sitting at he bar. To be honest I'm not even sure there was a manger working, no one stood out as being in charge. I am definitely not interested in returning to this establishment.  The interior of the restaurant was actually really cool. Hunting isn't really my thing, but I can admire someone's passion. I did really like that they had the history of the owner and about the hunting clubs. There was obviously a lot of money dumped into the place, but that can't save you from the lack of experience and passion in the kitchen and from the managers.   We paid $100+ for 2 people and I got a crappy steak

Last year i purchased a couples massage for my boyfriend and I.... The massages were fine (at least  mine was) the problem we had was the fact that we had asked for a man and a woman duo to massage us... The male for me and female for him. However they chose to do it their own way. He was instructing her and whispering to her the whole time, not very relaxing. My favorite part was her sniffling over me for an hour...

i just want to start off by saying that my boyfriend and i ONLY visited this place because of the good reviews posted on yelp.  We are the type of people that will try a mom and pop type place over corporate any day... with that said, i do expect the restaurant and its employees to put their food first. I was immediately disappointed to see a salad bar in a sit down restaurant not called "super salad". We were sat right away had a few mins and ordered a bottle of wine. The menu wasn't anything special, nothing really stood out as unique. I decided to go with the filet and pasta and the boy went for the prime rib (on special). We both were informed we would have the option to make our own salad from the salad bar. Lets just say the salad bar was limited... no eggs, no bacon, no 1000 island,  i guess if caesar was the type of salad you wanted it would be fine. We were given lemon sorbet before our meals came which was good, however served in plastic shot cups. When our food came everything looked AMAZING! I cut into my filet and realized it was not cooked to the medium temp that i ordered it, but was barely cooked enough to actually be served to the public. Obviously i sent it back to be cooked a little bit more. My boyfriend's prime rib looked delicious! Beautifully pink horse radish and au jus on the side. We both had pasta as our sides... the Alfredo was awful. I also added an extra side of their tomato which was equally as unpleasant. Flavorless to be exact. When my steak came back to me it was completely cooked, well done. I fought having a new one prepared for me, but when i realized it was too unbearable to consume i asked the hostess/busser to ask our server to come back, she was out side smoking. I gave her my steak and said i'd rather have a new one. She was gone for a new mins and came back to tell me that the kitchen was closed and it would take 40 mins to heat the grills and prepare me a new steak. Lets just say she tried to save the situation.... unfortunately for her and the owners of this establishment i am very aware of HOW things such as "ovens" and "grills" work. An already hot oven does not take my quoted "40 mins" to reheat. In fact  if you had just given me an over done steak cooked on the grill it would have still been hot... the steak that was returned to me had no re-sear marks on it and was rubbery... i do not appreciate being given a steak from the microwave. I have been in the restaurant industry for over 10years. I think the thing that upsets me the most is that this place has inexperienced COOKS working for them, i did have the pleasure of watching the kitchen staff run out of the restaurant 10 mins after they basically told me to take my steak and f*ck myself with it. The tattooed dark haired lady also felt it necessary to yell "F*CK THIS" upon exiting while my boyfriend was finishing HIS meal. So lets just say my over all experience was disgusting, i expect these things when im drunk at denny's, but i was prepared to drop a lot more money into this meal. I do not appreciate having my server shout at me lie to me or not fell it necessary to involve a manger in this ordeal. there is no way this place will survive. It was8 pm on a saturday night for crying out loud!

I have been thinking about trying Yoli's since i saw them on a morning news segment! However it was very disappointing. I had the carne asada burrito and my man had a the monte crisco sandwich and a side of potatoes. The burrito was very bland and has a strange after taste. After trying the other dishes, I realized that all the food had the strange after taste... I did not finish my meal... I've had better at filly b's. I will most likely not return. It was also uncomfortably warm in the restaurant. There are some amazing breakfast places around.... It's unfortunate that Yoli's doesn't make the grade in my opinion.

Finally got a chance to try Geno's today! I've been waiting for a good sandwich shop to open in my neighborhood! I had the "Geno's Italian" on wheat not toasted. It was perfect. Thinly slice onions and tomatoes, full of meat (big fan of boar's head), cheese, lettuce and house dressing. My boyfriend had the pastrami on white (no Swiss) it was also very good, the only issue was we had asked for it to be toasted and it was not... No biggie the place was poppin'. Being in the industry, I know how it is opening a new place with new staff getting worked... I have high hopes for this place.   Ps I think the negative review on here might just be a competitor... LAME.

The service was great, but like all the other Fox concepts you pay too much for mediocrity. The short rib stew was good. The ribs were cold and the chicken pasta was bland. There are just so many better options in the area... What a disappointment. But I should have known better.

There is nothing really great about this place.... The only reason i give 2 stars is because it's huge, which makes it a great place to watch multiple games! We went there for the fight (no cover) there must have been 7-10 bartenders working however my boyfriend and I were still ignored. We had to ask to order food drinks ect... Some of the bartenders were obviously beginners and seemed to lack training... Unfortunately I'll probably be back for football season, but I'm not going to beg to spend money. There are better quality places closer to my house.

We went to ricos today for lunch... My boyfriend had been to the one in QC and didnt remember much about his experience, so we decided to try again.  When we walked in I noticed the AWFUL paint peel off the bare walls... I know for a fact that the paint was there from the previous restaurants... Let's change it up a bit. It obviously worked out for them. The building it self was hot and sticky like the AC wasn't working/turned on. Gross.   For just the two of us it cost us $30 with no booze (tip included). Normally that doesn't bother me, I don't mind playing for quality. However when i have to walk up to a counter to place an order like I'm at McDonald's it does. Right off the bat i had a bad feeling about this place... From this point the food better be good. I got the chicken chimi and the boy got the combo with a taco and a steak burrito. We sat down and were given chips and salsa. Not bad. In my opinion it was bland and I like a little kick in my Mexican food. When our food arrived it looked awesome, so we dug in. My boyfriend said his shredded beef taco was delicious. Unfortunately the rest of the good fell flat. Everything was bland and by no means authentic. I think what i was most upset about is the store bought guacamole... It was obvious and disgusting. Guac is sooo simple to make!! I was actually really disappointed in this place. This is a white mans Mexican restaurant. I recommend the filibertos  in the next lot over. Better price and better flavor.   The only saving grace for this place is the staff. The man behind the counter was incredibly helpful when we were ordering and lady helping us on the floor was very attentive and accommodating. It's not her fault a Mexican restaurant is OUT of their hotter salsa.

Stopped in for a couple coffee drinks around noon, on a week day. Only 2 other people in the place. The cashier didn't even say hello or make eye contact. I felt like I was bothering her. The latte I received was not good, my husbands drink was though. I wanted to see what kind of food/snacks they had, but in reality I'll probably never be back.

My boyfriend and I were looking for somewhere new to watch the UFC fight we were unaware that Payton's place closed an reopened as "cogburns". So we decided to check it out...   Let me just start out by saying that Ashley was the only saving grace. The bartenders were very unknowledgeable and lack personality. My boyfriend always drinks margaritas on the rocks no salt. They girl that took our order did not make his drink which made me think she didn't know how... When he got it, it had salt and so she remade it.... The 2nd one came and it was made with grapefruit juice... And the part that kills me is that she knew she had used grapefruit and still served it! So now upon getting his 3rd drink... We grabbed a table in the dining area since the asu game was on the big tv... Still kept getting margs made with grapefruit, wings were ok... I dont think waste my money here...

"Meh" is about right...  I really wanted to like this place.... When we walked in there was sign that said "please seat your self", so we bellied up to the bar. We sat there for just few mins waiting for the bartender to come out of the kitchen.... Whatever. It wasn't busy by any means. I do like the beers on tab, however a little out of season for most of them. I can't drink heavy beer during the summer. The menu was small and not really what I was expecting. I ordered the Cajun burger... "Meh" is a good word this too. It came with the 2 tinniest onion rings I have seen, and they immediately fell off. The flavor was kinda strange... not gonna lie. I was starving and I couldn't even finish it, because the flavor was so unappetizing! The french fires I ordered on the side were cold and had way too much seasoning. My boyfriend had the roast beef sandwich. It was better then mine, but that ain't saying much. I think my real annoyance comes from the fact that the bartender offered us things like onion rings and additional cheese with out mentioning that they were an extra charge. I knew they were extra, but I don't like it when my "server" tries to jack-up my tab.   They have live music... which I don't think I would have enjoyed... From the posters, the musicians all looked kind of aggressive and loud... Not typical dining music. They also have "Carver Jones" playing there... He plays everywhere in Chandler. He's also kind of douchey.   All-in-all, I really cant see my self returning... Their are several other places with more menu options.  PASS....

This is the second time I have left disappointed here. The first is when they just opened. I will let that one go....   My boyfriend ordered first and this is where the problems started. He ordered the meatball sub.  The girl making the sandwich asked what type of bread he wanted (sourdough) and  confirmed he wanted provolone cheese then started throwing on the meatballs. The thing is, sourdough doesn't taste very good when cold and the warm meatballs were on top of cold cheese... She didn't even offer to toast the sandwich that is typically served hot! When he asked her to toast the sandwich to be toasted after she had made it, it was apparently an inconvenience to her and she just made a mess and STILL gave it to us.  When I ordered my sand which she was already over it, apparently. If I asked a question, I got a one word response.... I also wanted my sand which toasted, but again wasn't offered. I just dealt with the gross cold sourdough.... There are better options in the area... doubt i will be returning.

Just like the other reviews... Please save yourself the headache. The doctors are really lacking any type of bedside manner and very dismissive about concerns. I called a week ago to talk to some one about getting my records, I'm obviously transferring care, left a message and never got a call back. Had to take time off work to go in and the told me I wouldn't be able to get my records for 7-10 business days. There is a reason for all the terrible reviews.

I found this place driving around one night looking for some coffee other than circle k. I work the graveyard shift down the street and my lunch break is 230a... (I know). I walked in, the women working the counter was pulling out fresh donuts and asked me to wait. No problem! I order the largest coffee they offered, it was hot and fresh! Believe it or not it's hard to find in the area! I didn't order any food, but I will be! Thanks guys!

My husband and i have wanted to come here for a while... Im sad that our experience was so "meh".   The place had a couple tables, maybe 6 and a few people at the bar. We sat at a table along the wall looking towards the bar. I thought the TVs were kind of awkwardly placed.... I couldn't really see the ones on the opposite side, and i was sitting under the ones closes to me. I made it work. Our server came over for a drink order, he barely said hello, kinda making us feel like we were inconveniencing him. Drinks were just ok. My husband ordered a margarita, he said it was ok. The issue i have with that was, he ordered it with out salt, as he does EVERY time. Our server brought it out with salt on it and when he spoke up about it, the server looked at his book and snatched the glass off the table. All they did was wipe the salt off with a bar napkin, pushing all the salt to the bottom and dumped it into a new glass,  so basically he had a margarita mixed with salt. All my drink was, was syrup. We moved on. The plan was to have a big enough meal that we would not eat dinner (it was like 3) and watch some football. We started off with the wings, since it was our first time there we wanted to try a couple flavors. When we ordered half chipotle bbq and half sweet buffalo, our server said "yeah, i'll see if they'll do that".... As if was difficult for the kitchen, I've never heard of a sports-type bar declining that request. The description of the wings was definitely better than the actual flavor... we still ate them. My husband also ordered the guacamole and chips, that was terrible. Tasted like that fake, store bought holy guacamole. We decided to not have dinner. Neither of us were really excited about anything on the menu, since our appetizers fell flat.   We may come back... its not close enough for us to really go out of our way though.

I was very excited to try this place, being on the go all the time its hard to eat right. I waited in the drive thru (start to finish) for 20 mins. When I finally got the chance to order they were out of the protein I wanted. Since I wasn't able to back up and leave, I felt obligated to try some thing else. For the $2 upgrade I got the flank steak added to my order (instead of the preferred chicken). The disappointment came when I finally arrived home to eat it.. I had a total of 4 bites that's included the steak. The dressing on the lettuce was almost nonexistent. In my mind I paid $8 for a tortilla and lettuce...  I realize this is a new location and they are trying to get their flow down, but when you are out of product, with ridiculous wait times, what is the positive here? It would have been nice if they had notified people that they were out of product prior to getting up to the window. I would have left and you could have possibly left a different impression in my mind.

Wow... Just had the worst experience EVER at an Upward project establishment... We were seated promptly and the hostess was very inviting. Here's where we went wrong (apparently), the bartenders started off attentive, but that was short lived. Once our food arrive not once did either of them check on us. The busser/or server did, not the bartenders. They were so wrapped up in cleaning/side work  we didn't get to order our second round of drinks, ask for more guacamole or even get our check in a timely fashion. We actually waited 20 mins to ask some one if we could pay. Then another 10 mins for them to actually bring us the correct tab. I've been here numerous times! Truly disappointed....  On a good note, the food is always good.  We left and went next door to postinos to finish our meal. Had a great experience there....

I was pretty disappointed in my visit to the gladly... Definitely a fan of citizens public house, but not so much on the gladly.   I brought my husband here for his birthday about 2 weeks ago, we just moved to the area. I ordered the filet and he had the pork chop. Standard cinnamon-y/ apple flavor really not impressive. My steak was over cooked, the flavor was alright.... For the price of the meal, there are so many better options in the area. It was truly a let down, cph is sooooooo good!

Overall, my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our experience here. The pizzas were excellent, we were satisfied with our salad (not bad, but not amazing... It's a salad) and the staff was on point. I noticed the manager and staff members "table touching".   The ordering/payment location is a bit crammed, I bet it's annoying when they are busy. The other thing I saw people struggling with is whether they sit at a table or order from the counter. Nothing is clearly marked, not everyone has common sense.   We'll definitely be back.!

Been to Brooklyn V's several times since they've open, my complaint isn't the food...  Last night my husband tried to order a pizza for take out. It was 845, they close at 9. The young female on the phone stated that they didn't want to make our pizza since they were closing... Wow. Great customer service. We normally aren't those ppl that order for right before close, but we are moving away from the area and that would have been our last time there. Thanks for the great memory.

My fiancé and I stopped in for a quick dinner on a Tuesday night... The place was pretty empty. We sat at the bar, since it was the only place you get happy hour, service was attentive and quick. Since the appetizers were discounted for HH, we got 2. The corn and the "pico de avocado" were both fine, but pretty small portions. The menu is pretty simple and the decor is nice. We were both really disappointed in our food.... First I was sent out the wrong item. I ordered the chile rojo chicken dish, what I got was the relleno. I def snuck a bite, before sending it back. When I got my dish i was disappointed in the presentation, the chicken looked slopped on the plate, like cafeteria food. I thought the over all flavor was really boring and certainly not worth the $14 price tag. I just ate my tortilla and gave up. My fiancé's dish literally looked like dog food. He said it tasted similar. I did not try it. We both thought the rice and borracho beans we not worth eating. The salsa they brought us at the brining was watery... More like taco sauce.   On a good note... The tortillas and margaritas were good! Doubtful that we would ever return.

While out running errands the hubs and I decided to stop for a bite. We live in the neighbor and had seen the grand opening sign....   Upon walking in we were not greeted, even though the cashier was making a milkshake. When she walked passed us she still didn't acknowledge us... Then when we placed our order she just kinda stared. Not really a great impression.   Honestly, there is nothing special about this place. My fries came from the freezer and were undercooked. My burger was cooked all the way threw (they do not due temp requests) and flavor less. The hubs ordered a strawberry milkshake, for the price the cup was super small and we watched the cashier throw what wouldn't fit in the cup away. If you're going to waste your product, you could have given it to us... Either way it's costing you.  I could have literally has the exact meal at Burger King for a better value.   Doubt I'll return :(

Sunday 11am.   My husband and I walked into the "sports grill" for Football Sunday, noticed the empty bar and attempted to take a seat. The lovely bartender tells us "the steeler game is over there" and points to a corner in the room. There were two people seated at a 20 top bar and you're turning us away?? The three tv's over the bar were all tuned to the same game. OK.   We sat at in the corner we were directed after the hostess, who turned out to be our server, provided some off the mark excuse about why they can't change the tv's. Listen guys, I get the tv thing, but when your establishment is empty, you may want to consider bending the rules. Our server advised us that the lunch menu was beginning at 11 and their 9 item brunch menu until 12. As soon as I decide on my food choice, she rushes over to say we can't order lunch... At 11... I felt forced to order the breakfast burrito since 2 of the options included hot/cold cereal... Really? I have that at home. No lie. I really do.   So after what seems to be a lifetime... I had to use the restroom. When I came back, apparently the manager had stopped by apologizing for the lunch menu not being available to us... Well me. He bought our meal before it arrived. Our food arrived and it looked gross. Tortilla barely cooked, eggs were rubbery and salsa was bland. Even though I was starving, I still only ate half. Now, the best part... While I finished my half of burrito, at 1145, the obnoxiously drunk table we were forced to sit next too got their food. Guess what they got?!? LUNCH!! Not just lunch, blt's. The specific menu item I wanted, yet denied. Also, I wasn't offered another cocktail until I was finished eating.   I don't get the five star reviews. The food was not good. If it was taken care of already, I would have sent it back. Service was slow and the bartender was rude.    Maybe in six months I'll consider returning.... IF they are are open.

What an amazing day we had....    Headed out about 10a... Ride up was pretty casual. Our driver, Trevor was pretty knowledgeable about the places we were going and wasn't pushy at all. We stayed as long as we wanted at each stop, a total of 3 wineries,1 tasting room and lunch! My girlfriends and I were looking for more of a social event and are by no means cork dorks (: The places we chose were all pretty close to each other giving us time to walk the downtown shops in the tiny town. I was back home by 6!!

I know I'm a little late on the is review... But my experience here was really sub par. First off I ordered plain chicken, since i wanted a vinegarette dressing. I got some Mexican type seasoned chicken... It was terrible with my dressing option. My biggest issue is that I had ordered a large salad, I received the small one. Since I was not provided a receipt, I had to go up and ask for one to see what I was actually charged for.  I saw several ppl leaving the counters with these huge salads. It cost my husband and I almost $30 to eat salads and sandwiches...neither of us were impressed, especially for the price.
