The staff here (Steph served us!) was fantastic! We ordered a couple of flights and then had a glass of our favorite - outstanding wine selection! I also couldn't get over how AWESOME the music selection was. Great food, great wine, great server (Steph!) - we will be back!

This shop continues to prove itself! I made a 5:30 PM appointment online the night before and sure enough, they let me in with a tire repair.  Like they state online and in-store, tire repairs are free if they can fix them (with the certificate, I think).  I've been going here for years and I'm never disappointed.  Keep it up.

Awesome find! We had the Emerald Chicken (my favorite), Red Jade Chicken, Chile Relleno, and Machaca. My wife loved the black beans! Atmosphere was laid back and the staff was friendly and made the experience a good one. Very inexpensive and would probably be categorized as fast casual. I wish they still had their east valley location!

Very generous portions and Winesday is a must (half off ALL bottles)!  My wife had the eggplant parm and I had a delicious cheese steak hoagie.  This will be our local Italian joint!

I brought a general idea with a couple of pictures to Michael at Tattoo U.  I was pleasantly surprised when he took my concept and made it a custom tattoo.    The piece was highly personal and emotional and he took my experience and translated it into art.  I've found my tattoo artist and shop.

I wish I didn't have to write this follow-up. A few months ago I got some work done at the shop and I am happy with the work itself. The problem is that I used gift certificates and the owner was not pleased about that as he was expecting cash. When I presented the gift certificates as payment he informed me that that money was already spent and that he wished I would've told him ahead of time. It made me wonder if I would've received a different quality of work or even a slower process if I would've informed him that I had gift certificates to use. Very disappointing and I will not be back.

Good customer service goes a long way. I showed up at 2:05 on Saturday and they closed at 2:00. They didn't have to let me in and unlock the door so I can do my transaction but they did. Most places wouldn't.

Nailed it!  The atmosphere is great!  The service is great!  The Italian Sandwich is the BEST Italian Sandwich I have ever eaten.  This will be a regular stop!

Came here with 10 high school students before a leadership development event. They got us through and fed in ten minutes! Staff was friendly and accommodating. Keep it up!

The happy hour specials here are pretty solid.  $5 speciality drinks and decent prices for appetizers also.  I went on a Tuesday afternoon and it was packed. Good vibe and friendly staff.

Service goes a long way! Props to our bartender, Andy, for taking care of us and even storing the flowers that I bought for my wife in the walk in-fridge! Great atmosphere, great drink prices, great local bar! We'll continue to make this a regular stop. Thank you!

I love that my favorite Starbucks is a Starbucks that is in my community!  The staff here really takes the time to get to know you and their attitude is contagious. My man Tucker is always in a good mood as is the rest of the team here. Whether they're busy or slow, the service is constant and experience is great. Keep up the good work.

I know that a ton of people like this place but I've never been impressed.  The spice level is too much to be enjoyable so I tried something that wasn't listed as spicy.  I had the chicken taco salad and the chicken was good but there was no real flavor to the dish.  The Camelback location (where I ate today) did have really good service which is completely different than the experience that I had at the Ahwatukee location awhile back.  So many better options for Mexican food in this area.

We only had the pretzels to eat but they were great. We had a scotch flight that was solid and the beer list is good. Nice atmosphere and the staff is super nice. We'll be back!

So excited to be able to give an auto repair/service company a five star rating. The shop is close to my house and had really good ratings on Yelp so I gave it a shot. It's always difficult to find a shop that you can trust that has decent prices. I called and scheduled the appointment with Rob and he was also the guy that took care of me when I arrived. He was great the other technicians were great and I was in and out in a couple of hours. Very satisfied and happy to report that I think I found my shop.

Horrible security process run by disrespectful guards. Amazing that this place has limited hours as there was a line out the door prior to the office opening. Such a bad experience.

Another great Thai food option in the valley! Drunken noodles were great and the Old Fashioned was well made!  Happy to have this gem so close to home!

Can't beat Lyft when it comes getting a ride! I'll NEVER take a cab again. My Lyft drivers have been fun, nice, and knowledgeable about the area.  Significantly cheaper than a cab also. So happy to have Lyft in the valley!

Great food, great service, great vibe, great happy hour! This will be a regular spot for me. Try the Clam-Mari on the Happy Hour menu. You will not be disappointed!

This is my spot!  Great concept for keeping your hair on point.  The staff there is awesome, the  location is great, and the atmosphere is very laid back (awesome piece of custom art near the hair washing area!).  I'm a regular and plan to be for a long time to come.  The haircut subscription concept is genius and Keep It Cut is on the cutting edge (see what I did there!?)!
