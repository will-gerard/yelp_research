Worst customer service... Been here for a hour and we are the only customers here but no one even comes to acknowledge us. This place deserves to close down. Oh by the way, i did make an appointment 2 weeks ahead of time.

Great food and service. Must try the steak kabob plate and if u like chicken as well. Get the combo plate! Very filling so no need to order any extra.

This restaraunt is located in the best place possible however.. The food is mediocre at best. Because of the low price for lunch special we as consumer has to make big sacrifices such as eating shit. That alone is already a big enough detractor to turn customers away but they top it off with turtle speed customer service. This is unfortunate.

Went here for my Birthday with high hopes for this place due to multiple recommendation from friends. This place is a total let down. The first round of AYCE was mediocre and the second and third round came out disgusting. The fish was still icy, the albacore had no flavoring and the color is not even right. Not to mention the hours we spent waiting for our food that we can never retrieve. If you like to eat crap sushi and wait a especially long time for it? This is your ultimate GOTO place. There arn't many good places in Arizona for AYCE sushi and this place just needs to CLOSE DOWN.

Came here only because my friend wanted to go to a buffet. The food is crap, not one thing i had is decent. Even the fried chicken wings r disgusting... Like how can you make that wrong?? Anyways one thing I want to highlight is the sashimi... I attached a picture below but basically it looks like death X4... Would never return.

The food here was pretty good. I did not find it amazing but they have some good selections. The food was a bit pricey but thats because your paying for the atmosphere as well. The highlight of this place was the exceptional service provided!

Was informed by my co-workers of this place so I decided to give it a try. The place has a nice atmosphere and the servers are very welcoming. My sister ordered the steak bavette and I ordered the duck and a bowl of clam chowder. We decided to add one of their popular appetizers brussel sprouts as well. We received our soups first and the clam chowder was only luke warm but the flavoring was great. Then they brought out our appetizer brussel sprouts and WOW... It was the best brussel sprouts I've ever had. My duck was mediocre but the steak bavette my sister got was really good. This is a great place to dine in and good atmosphere. I will be returning soon!  *must try the Brussel sprouts*

This place offers excellent customer service, the owners are willing to work with you on substitutions at no additional charge. I am a regular here and what I can say is that this place has switched owners atleast 4x since 2010. The price is great for what they offer. I have tried their specialty rolls and they are just average. What stands out is the chirashi bowl for 11.95 all day price. If you like hot food please try the yellow tail collar (kama). It will not dissapoint.

The food was great and they provided me excellent service. A side note is that i had the mionas special chicken and general yan chicken. Super tasty and price is right for the lunch combo.

Highly recommend this place if you like options. The price is a flat 7.99$ before tax for an 8inch pizza. You get a base and you can choose the sauces, meats, veggies, and seasoning. They dont limit you therefore you can add as much as youd like at no sacrifise.   Personally, i got tomato sauce on the inner ring and garlic sauce on the outer ring. On top is parmesan cheese, chicken, peperoni, ham, mushroom, and a sprinkle of oregano. It taste delicious!

Probably the best boba place in AZ right now. They have a wide available selections of tea flavors. To top it off they have a great snack item that is a must try! Get the popcorn chicken!

Saw this place with good reviews so my friend and I decided to try it out. We ordered the spring rolls and egg rolls for appetizer and they were suprisingly pretty good. The eggroll tasted different but in a good way. I got the pho tai and had the meat on the side. Broth was decent and all together it was a good experience. Will be returning to try the sandwich and the rice dish!

Been here several times now and the food has always met my expectations. The two must trys are the bun bo hue and the spring rolls. Highly recommend them.   The spring rolls are fresh made everyday and the use actual peanut sauce.  Im not a fan of pork blood, tendon, or tripe therefore I had them remove them from my bun bo hue instead they replaced it with more brisket. I also added pho beef rounds to it so it was extra delicious!

I have to be honest here, I cant even lie about it even if I tried. The food is awful. My sister and I came in and ordered three appetizers: agadashi tofu, japanese chicken wings, and gyoza. We asked our waitress if the gyoza is hand made or store bought and she had the audacity to lie in front of my face saying its hand made. I tried it and it is the most common purchased gyoza at your local lee lee oriental super market. My god.. Each of the appetizers were 7$ and the portion is ridiculous as well as the taste. The chicken wing tasted like its been put into the fryer and someone dripped some soy sauce on it. The tofu is not a normal agadashi tofu size and it taste bland and under fried. The worst part was the ramen... I got the signature tonkatsu ramen and double meat. Thats my biggest mistake of the night. I always taste the broth first as it is the indicator to how good the ramen will be. And it taste like aged water... The noodle was alright and the pork tasted like burnt shit. I would highly not recommend this place. The only time i can see someone giving this place more than a 2 star is when that person had poverty standards. Oh.. Im giving this place a 1 star because even the service was terrible. Never a refill or taken any of the appetizer plates away. Good luck

Have not seen a authentic chinese cafe in arizona until this one opened! When walking in it gives you the feel if a chinese restaraunt but with a more modern look. The menu offers a variety of drinks/desserts along with a wide variety of dishes.  I personally recommend the curry fishball and fried chicken wings for appetizer. The salt and pepper pork chop and yang chow fried rice for entree. To top it off i had a hong kong style tea for beverage and for desert i got the mango pomelo!   Will be returning to try all the other dishes!
