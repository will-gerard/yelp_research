I had no problem redeeming the 30-50 coupon. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable.  The clothes came out clean, except one that said they couldn't take the stains off without damaging the item, that item was charge which I don't think it should; since it was not cleaned.  The price on my personal opinion it's very expensive. I took 11 pieces and paid with coupon over $80.

I came here about a month ago because I have sensitive teeth, and also to get a regular cleaning. I saw dentist Sheryl I believe is her name.  So she checked me, and said I needed to use floss more often, and that I needed a regular cleaning; then another male dentist came to check me, and he said I had my gums to low, due to a bacteria I can't remember the name. So he recommended a deep cleaning, otherwise in a far future I could end up with out teeth; to make the story short. So, the female dentist started explaining the procedure, and I noticed she was nervous, as she was explaining.  They wanted to get me in immediately. For the price, they wanted to charge me $400 for the entire mouth; so I look for a second opinion, and as I thought they were lying to me; I had gingivitis and just needed a regular cleaning. My gums being to low is because I brush my teeth to aggressive, which I do.   So, NO! I do not recommend this place at all.

I had a problem with my honda Accord, I went to see a couple mechanics before I came to D&W honda repair; it was a lot of stress but finally, when I brought my car to this guys, they fixed my car right away. I recommend them 100%, great service!!
