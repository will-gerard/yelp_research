I'm taking my dad here.  This place is pretty authentic- made me long for a beach in lareado.   The Hunny and I had a dozen oysters (not a good choice but not bad any means)  We downed those with tapatio and fresh lime.   Then we had ceviche.  So good! I loved it. It was hearty with great lime sauce.   I had the fish tacos and he had shrimp and fish veracruz or something.  Both were good- did it taste like the freshest fish of all time? no.  Did I eat it anyways because it tasted like Baja California. Yup.   I really like this place.  They also have the fat boy's favorite mexican beer- bohemia.

Right around the corner from my house. It's a little independent coffee shop that serves up piping hot lattes and fresh brewed coffee.  The woman the runs the place is the sweetest thing, she gave my dog cookies and even recommended a good groomer for her.  She serves breakfast but I've never eaten there. There is lots of space to sit and read the paper and there is free wifi.  Great little place. I'm happy to support this small, local businesses.

Just had breakfast here. Really good, great toast. Very affordable, also.

There's a big part of me that want to talk a lot of smack about the trendy hipster vibe of this place... but bottom-line they have great food, and a wonderful wine, bubbly, and beer selection.  Are the owners from California because it totally seems like it....  Fresh kale salad, the best red velet cake ever (this is not a compliment I dole out lightly,) and I love their vegan pizza.  Fresh pesto heaped with veggies. So. good. There's actually some left over in my fridge right now.  It's a shit-show on Saturday mornings- packed with terrible parking.  I'd say the prices are slightly high and the girls that work the front counter can act 'too cool' but its great place to watch awkward first dates, men in sleeveless shirts, and girls in lululemon riding fixies.  The to-go ordering is really efficient and delicious. Check this place out for sure.

So over rated.  I'm from San Francisco- I have high standards for my sushi.  I especially dislike sub-par fish in a place that tries to look/act swanky.  This reminds me of a sleazy date spot- oh wait it is!  I prefer my secret spot in Avondale for better prices, fresher fish, and more attentive staff.

I love this gym-  No pressure sales. Money-back guarantee and great facilities.  It's a little gimmicky with the spa and cafe and LTBucks but over all a good space with nice clean, functioning equipment.   Shane helped me sign up and he really took care of me without the sales guy feel. If your thinking of signing up you should go talk to him- he;ll hook you up and show you around without any pressure. Very straightforward.   I'll update more as I use my membership.

I kind of like this place.   Pros-  Cornbread Solid wine list Boys in Levi's  large portions Awesome specials  Cons- Sub-par calamari Some of the staff was snobby  The atmosphere here is just peachy. South western vibe- large oak trees cover the patio. You can watch the star studded sky and roaring fire while enjoying dinner.  I would only eat here if I'm dining on the patio.   The food is solid, not the best I've ever had but the portions are generous, it is fresh, and it's good.  I had the halibut, calamari, lime cheesecake with a bottle of Rochioli.  They were accommodating and quick.   The halibut was great. The calamari sucked. Over-cooked, over-battered, rubbery.  Lime Cheesecake was okay- no crust, I liked that.   The steak looked sooo good. Made a vegetarian like me drool.  Will return- boy in tow.

Eff this place.  Worst. nails. ever.  Sloppy and over priced.   Ps- the 10% percent off sign they fly 12 months a year is a big ol' sham.

Reminds me of home. (SF)  Efficient, unfriendly service, great food, low prices. Pho Gha with heaps of fresh sides priced at 6.50 or something and a banh mi ($3) and some spring rolls for my fat hunny.  Totally packed on a Saturday afternoon- expansive menu, vietnamese ice coffee served properly.  I can't wait to go back.

Found this place through my insurance and I really love it.  I generally see one of 2 PA's for my needs and they are bright and very nice.  Further, everything is clean and friendly. Its not fancy, but they get the job done and I feel confident about the care I receive.

You order with a grouchy blonde college girl using an ipad2- but they cant afford to actually put toppings on your ramen.   I will go until someone recommends better ramen places in Phoenix. I'm from San Francisco (Can I make that bold?) so I'm not impressed with oily/watery tonkatsu topped with 2 measly pieces of thinly sliced cold tough pork.  Its not bad ramen, but this isn't how it is supposed to be done.   The product should match the photos on the website at the least... It does not.

I'm here at least twice a week for work. This is true community spot. Forget Starbucks. SoZo is the new black.   Great and unique coffee drinks are whipped up quick and carefully. This is the good stuff people, high quality coffee, with lots of options. Soy, sugarfree, you name it.  I die for the hazelnut or vanilla lattes. And a doppio will really get you going after a long night.   They have a large space with a small bar for sitting, sofas, chairs, and outdoor seating.  They also boast a super awesome play room for your grommits so you can hang out and get some work done or play too!   Just a really lovely spot where you can hang out and meet your neighbors while getting your morning coffee!
