This was my first time here and I will NEVER be back. My friend had a few drinks but was in better condition than most of the people I saw stumbling around and was escorted out, to our amazement, from the restroom because she was apparently intoxicated. This was because a waitress directed the bouncer to do so. Even the bouncer looked confused when my friend quiet and confused walked a nice straight line out the door. I am in my 30s and spent many a night during my 20s hugging toilets in bars and never had anything like this happen when it should have. She wasn't even gone from our table for more than 5 min when this happened.  So... Apparently if u spend over 30 seconds in the bathroom, u WILL be escorted out! Crazy , most bizarre situation ever! NEVER COMING BACK!

I think they may have spilled coffee in my creamer! Wow!  If I wanted a latte, I would have ordered one.

woohoo! Spiciest jalape√±o cilantro hummus I've ever had! Delicious! And the chicken was really good. I can't wait to go back and try something else. So far, I'm a huge fan:-) I will definitely be coming here more often.

Linda did an amazing job. I was so thankful she stayed late for me since I rarely have time to pamper myself. Thanks!
