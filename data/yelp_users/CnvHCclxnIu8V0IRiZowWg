The Gilbert office in the Mercy Gilbert medical campus is a convenient and easy to find location, with ample parking.   I saw Dr. Chu in Gilbert for the full duration of my pregnancy and she ultimately delivered my baby. She is a great doctor, easy to be open with, who is also straight forward but sincere in return. There were several times when I contacted Dr. Chu in between my regular appointments to address concerns and come in last minute, and she accommodated my every need. During my delivery, I felt very comfortable with Dr. Chu and placed full trust in her and her guidance. Due to the delivery being free of complications, we were able to meet some of my additional requests post-delivery, such as delayed cord clamping. I would absolutely recommend Dr. Chu for future patients, and intend to keep her as my doctor moving forward.   My only complaint is that care is not centralized - ultrasounds must be done at a different Chandler location or in Ahwatukee, lab work must be done at a separate lab Corp location. The lab Corp a few suites down from the NHWC Gilbert office did not have supplies to do two of my labs (glucose tests) and had to send me to a different location.  Driving all over the valley can be very frustrating and tedious.

I have been using Bryant Pest Control for around 1.5 years and usually have a good experience, quick responses via phone and email and friendly technicians.   My only complaint is that I've had an unfriendly technician a couple of times who actually sprayed the chemical basically in my 25lbs dogs face today. I had to ask him to wait for me to move the dog before he starts spraying the chemicals so that my dog doesn't get poisoned. It's not as if I was taking time to move the dog--the guy walked into my house, I walked over to him to ask my question, my dog followed me (as dogs do) and was smelling the guys shoe and he just started spraying the chemical!  Have a little courtesy and respect for people's family members!   I will be calling the company today to request them to never dispatch this tech to my house again, he is not welcome here if he cannot be a little friendly and respect my pets  Finally - Bruce is awesome. He is always friendly and stops to say "hi" to my dog for a few minutes before or after spraying the house.  UPDATE - I called the company and they were indeed apologetic for the employees behavior and offered a refund on this months service and to speak with the owner about the incident. This is why I keep using Bryant :) One bad employee doesn't sour the entire company, and luckily I've had a long history with them to know that!   And yes, my pup is still alive and well :)

I am new to Dr. Steve's office, but have had great experiences during my visits, which has greatly improved all of my problem areas. The staff is friendly and the office is open and clean!   My only complaint is that he does not accept Cigna insurance, so this care is out of network for me and I will need to seek a new, in network, chiropractor as a result (which is really just me feeling sorry for myself). While the care and attention received here is superior, I can't justify paying 100% of the cost for it with a baby on the way when I could be paying just a few dollars for it at an in-network doctor.  Just an update: I did visit a new chiropractor who consistently told me that he could provide very little treatment and care to me because I was pregnant, yet he accepted me as a pre-natal patient. He constantly asked me what Dr. Steve did in the few appointments I saw him, and I honestly didn't know how to respond. I promptly stopped seeing the new chiropractor because I began having abdominal pain from him pushing my belly into the table. There was no comparison to the care I received from Dr. Steve and the new chiropractor.

I've been to a lot of nail salons in Arizona, and this is the only one I've become a regular at. The owners are very friendly and accommodating, the staff is great and professional, and they have more gel colors than I've ever seen. They also use great quality brands of polish that are long lasting. I usually get a gel mani or gel polish change, but their pedi's are excellent too.   Love the decor of the salon - very warm and inviting and tastefully decorated down to the minute detail.

I cannot say enough about University Animal Hospital, and Dr. Koch in particular.  I have been taking my dog Tucker here since I adopted him from the shelter in Sept. 2012 - Being from the shelter, Tucker has had a lot of problems.  In his initial visit, I received a HUGE discount simply because I brought in a rescued animal - My first appointment was with Dr. Tascon, a fantastic vet.  Shortly after my first visit, Tucker was having all sorts of issues with his breathing, digestive system, etc.  Dr. Tascon was booked but Dr. Koch was able to squeeze me in.  Since that first appointment with Dr. Koch, most of my appointments have been the same - I leave him urgent voicemails that something is wrong with Tucker and he squeezes me into his booked schedule between appointments, and even before his official work day starts.  Whenever we need to put Tucker on a medication, Dr. Koch calls me EVERY morning for a week or two to see how he's doing and get a status report.  Not only has Dr. Koch put Tucker on the right medications he's needed to get well, but he's also helped me search for permanent solutions through his diet, added fiber, etc (including sitting on the phone with me and listening to all of the ingredients in Tucker's food to try to find what could be disrupting his system).    I am so relieved to have such great doctors and a facility totally dedicated to my pet's health.  Each visit is around $45-$60, which may seem a bit costly - but the care you and your pet receive are unparalleled to any other animal care providers!   Thank you University Animal Hospital, and Dr. Koch for all that you do!

Normally I'm a big advocate of filibertos. But after my order not only being incorrect today. dec. 21, 2015, my food had a ROCK in it. They are lucky I didn't choke on it or break a tooth. While that may seem like a "silver lining" to the optimists of Yelp... I'm SO done with Filibertos.

I have never had a more awkward drive-thru situation in my entire life.   I personally don't eat here because their food nauseates me for some reason (sanitation?), but my husband likes it so I came here for him tonight.   Selina, the gal who took my order according to the receipt, was ridiculously awkward. I ordered, she repeated it back incorrectly in pieces. I re-ordered it. She repeated it, I said "correct".... Then there was silence for 30 seconds. So I asked, "Are you done asking questions or what's going on?"  She repeated my order again INCORRECTLY. I corrected her and just drove around to the window. I don't have time for these games all night. When I pulled up to the window she was telling her colleagues about how awkward I am.   Seriously: Chicken, mashed potatoes, corn on the cob, and a coca-cola is probably one of the most common meals in America. I'd hate to know what my experience would have been like if I had a complex order.   Be professional at your job and do it right, thanks. I don't normally call poor employees out by name, but this is well-deserved.

Best and most authentic Italian food we've had in Arizona! It's a fairly small location, but was absolutely packed when we got there (always a good sign!).   I ordered the mushroom risotto, which was much better than I anticipated, and my husband got the bucatini carbonara. Both dishes were made to perfection and I know we will be back on our next date night!   Another "plus" of this restaurant is that they make all of their own pasta in house, and it's served al dente (the way it should be).

I've had consistent issues with this particular location, which I've frequented due to its close proximity to my house. Today is my last trip there, however, due to receiving a Tall sized beverage which was only filled ~half way (to the sirens crown on the logo). (See the pic--the cup is like half empty!)  My last trip there, a couple weeks ago, I had to have my drinks made three times due to the baristas continuously giving us lots of foam on "no foam" beverages.

Extremely long wait times - waiting over an hour with my newborn baby for her lab work. The wait room is very small and completely packed.   The staff at this location is very generic for my experience in Arizona - unfriendly, clearly not enjoying their job so they don't project friendliness to the patients/customers.

I've been frequenting La Vida for about 7 months for pre-natal massages. The entire staff here is very friendly, and all of the massage therapists I've seen are great, but I prefer to see Chella in particular.   Chella is great at what she does, has deep knowledge about the muscles and body, and will help straighten out any issues you're having. She is also great company if you like to chat during your massage (I'm a chatterbox), or if you're into silent relaxation, she is fine with that too.   If you like to get massages regularly, I recommend signing up for their monthly package where you are charged for 1 massage (whether you make it in or not, it gets deducted from your account) at a discounted rate, and any additional massages booked during the month will be at a further discounted rate.

The food at this location is fresh and the service is good - their rolled tacos with guacamole are great and the horchata is not too sweet.   They are open 24 hrs and have a drive thru.   The downside is that it takes a really long time to get your food -- you may be waiting up to ten minutes or longer for a small order.. Even in the drive thru. But on the plus side, you can be sure that your meal was made to order and was prepared specifically for you

I've been coming to Mood Swings for almost 2 years and have had an overall good experience, with the exception of a couple hiccups.   For the last 8 months I've been seeing Dana.  I love coming in to see Dana - she's friendly, open, and always does an awesome job with my hair! I trust her judgement completely on what she thinks will/won't work with my hair. If rating my service from Dana alone, I'd give 5 stars   Unfortunately my last provider, who I saw for nearly a year was horrible at cutting my hair and after our year-long relationship I finally opened up to her about trying to cut my hair a little differently and she pretty much popped. It's not that she was doing a bad job, but what she was doing wasn't working for me and I dealt with it for many many months. After her reaction, I spoke to a manager and was ready to take my services elsewhere when she proposed I meet with Dana. Things have been great since then!  Other than that, the service is good. Little pricey.

We used to frequent this restaurant quite often when we lived in Tempe and the quality was amazing. As an American who grew up in a traditional midwest household, my tolerance for spicy food is extremely low. My husband is from India, however, and needs spice in his meals -- so this place used to be perfect for us because I could get mild dishes.   I don't know if the management has changed or what, but today when we were there we were told that all of the food is pre-made and they cannot make anything without red chili. The only option is to pour creme into a pre-made dish to try to dilute it. I have never had this happen at a restaurant before and was absolutely shocked to learn all of the food is pre-made spicy here. Cooking indian food at home and having half of a family that's indian, I know it is very simple and possible to make non-spicy food without the use of creme--it's done by not using so much red chili.   Honestly, the easy answer to appeal to more customers here is to make all food mild and add heat to it based on a customers preferences instead of making it all spicy.   So while our family all enjoyed lunch, I was not able to eat because I am 8 months pregnant and cannot have spicy food. I prefer vegetarian food and the only non-spicy veg they had was palak paneer which is full of creme.

Stopped in for the first time today. The location is fairly small but they have a decent variety of cupcakes.   I ordered the New York Cheesecake cupcake and was surprised to find that it was not actually cheesecake, but a with graham cracker crust in the bottom and some sort of cream on top. The cake was very moist (to the point where I wasn't sure if it was moist or undercooked/gooey), but SUPER rich and sweet. I was only able to make it through a couple bites before tossing it in the fridge for tomorrow.   The cupcakes are $3.50 each but are pretty big. All in all, not bad but not sure if I'll frequent the store.

Neelam, the owner, did my henna for my hindu wedding in May as well as for all of my female wedding guests (roughly 35 women).    When we scheduled the appointment, we advised that we would only require about 4 hours of her because we were not expecting anyone to get elaborate henna.  However, upon seeing the beautiful work that Neelam does, I was the one who wanted the most elaborate and detailed henna imaginable.    We ended up needing Neelam for about 7 hours that day, although it was nearly twice the amount of time we requested, she stayed and completed everyone's henna without any fuss.  She is an amazing woman to work with - so friendly, talented, and quick.  For the less detailed henna designs, she was taking 5 minutes or less.    As a bonus, Neelam came to our house where the event was being held that day.  For any bride looking looking for the perfect henna for her wedding day, or anyone interested in getting a cool henna design - I'd recommend giving Neelam a call.

This is a long overdue review, as my service was in early November or late October if 2014.   I came in looking to de-stress after a couple of tough tough weeks and was quite disappointed. The staff members that I interacted with were all very friendly, including my massage therapist, but she seemed to be very inexperienced.   When I booked my appointment, I specifically indicated that sciatic nerve pain was an issue, and again reminded my massage therapist before we began. I recall pressuring the receptionist about the qualifications and experience (in terms of years) of the massage therapist I'd booked with, but she didn't tell me but instead suggested that I could see someone else. With that, I assumed it was a fairly newly certified person, but wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt--years of experience doesn't always translate into better quality.   Now, I love deep tissue massages and specifically request them. But this "deep tissue massage" was done with extreme excessive force and my body was visibly bruised for the next several days. Not only that, but while applying pressure to my sciatic nerve that I advised was particularly sensitive, she was using her elbow and putting full weight on it--I *literally* screamed out in pain and pulled my body away from her. Although she did apologize, I was completely turned off from this spa after the incident.

I come here frequently for the variety of flowers available and the great sale on Friday (50% off all flowers from 12-4). However, many times the flowers are breathing their last breath and die shortly after taking them out of the cooler at the shop. Usually I don't mind as much because I got them on sale.   However, Tuesday 5/19/15, my husband bought me a beautiful bouquet from this location for our anniversary. Within 24 hours, all of the blue flowers in the bouquet (which made up several of the stems), had fallen off and into a big mess on the kitchen floor and counter. When you pay so much for flowers, you should at least get ONE day out of them! (See picture)  Also, not everyone here is as friendly. I'd come in one morning looking to purchase flowers for my grandmothers 80th birthday, which was around Easter time, and the woman made it very clear that I was an inconvenience and said that they wouldn't have time to arrange the flowers I'd picked out into a bouquet because I didn't call ahead of time. My only option was to pay for one of their over priced pre-arranged bouquets (which I did... $64.99 for TULIPS--the cheapest flower next to carnations) or leave with loose, un-arranged flowers.   Usually I go to just get flowers for my house, which is fine. But the next time I need to get them as a gift, I'll not be going here.

AWFUL - DO NOT USE.   I used this company for the move of my home - of which, I had already moved everything that I could on my own with few remaining objects in the (the large things that I had no means to transport--couch, bed, dining table, etc).  I scheduled the move to begin from 8-9, and the owner assured me the drivers would arrive close to 8:00 am.   By nearly 10:00 am, I was fed up with waiting because I had taken time off from work as well as requested a family member to take time off from work to help with the move and my time was being wasted.  I called the owner around 9:45 am to notify him that if the movers were not in my driveway by 10:00 am to call them and cancel because I didn't have time to waste.  At which point I was SCREAMED at, BERATED, INSULTED, and DAMNED as another "awful customer" that he's "sick of".  At which point he screamed at he is "in his car and 'bout to come tell me his opinion".  - I feared for my safety that I may be physically harmed and almost called the police.  At 10:00 (almost on the dot) the movers arrived - two tattoo'd kids in an un-labeled moving truck.  Still out of fear for my safety now that 3 (including the owner that was "on his way") angry, unprofessional, and creepy men were arriving at my home, I continued with the move -- I texted all of my neighbors to please be on guard and listen carefully for my voice if I needed their help.   1.5 hours later, damaged walls, their bathroom breaks in my house, sitting in the car with their boss and not working for a 15-20 minute period, the move was done and ready to be taken to the new house. The owner did, by the way, come to my house in his PAJAMAS to fix two damaged spots on the wall (there were actually more), which took him about 45 minutes because he didn't have any supplies and had to go to Walmart to get them. He also took the opportunity to complain about having to clean up the damage of the employees to talk about all the others things he felt were structurally wrong with my house which was built only 1 yr ago and we were the first owners.  The drivers did not have GPS or any form to be contacted (no working phones) and I had to trust that they would closely follow behind me.  Which they did - they turned corners like mad men and I feared for my belongings.  At the new house,  I was informed that my belongings would not be unloaded until I paid - which is fine.  However, the owner took about 30 minutes to send the pay pal email which again was a lot of arguing, screaming at me, and berating me - which I had on speaker phone for my family member and his employees to hear.  All of which were shaking their heads and apologizing saying that I did not deserve such treatment. He also tacked on a $40 charge for "shrink wrap" because he told him employees, without my knowledge, to wrap a cupboard of mine (which I had the supplies to do myself, and it was already taped shut)--having that removed was another argument, which the employees ended up taking over on my behalf.  Additionally, he asked how I would be paying and I told him via debit card, and he screamed at me for probably two minutes about how he doesn't accept e-checks, each time I replied, "As previously stated, that shouldn't be an issue since I'm paying with a debit card."  Throughout the move, the employees were talking about drugs, dealing shrooms, etc.  Because they had no phones, their boss kept calling MY phone and asking to speak to them about non-work related crap on MY time, MY dime, MY phone.    After the movers left, the owner called to apologize for his behavior.  Well, my leather couch is completely ruined, and many other things are damaged.  Not only that, I have never been so disrespected by a disgusting, nasty, man in my entire life - so take your apology and SHOVE IT!   Do not use this company if you value your safety, dignity, and belongings.  I cannot tell you how many times I felt I almost had to call the police to supervise the activity, and foolishly out of fear for my safety and belongings did not.

There are several great aspects to this company. First, I'll start with the downfall... because I can only think of one. The wait at the drive-through is extremely long, it could be sped up quite a bit because it doesn't actually save time from what it would take to park and walk in. I was the only customer in the drive-through, after placing my order I spent about 5 minutes waiting at the window -- longer than expected, but tolerable.  However, on the plus side there's a DRIVE-THROUGH.  Although it may take less time to just park and walk inside, the benefit of having a drive-through is that you don't have to get ready in the morning or late at night. The drive-through and shop are open 24 hours a day...how many more ways can I say "amazing"??  Next - I love boba tea and usually have to drive 20 minutes to Chandler for a decent one from Boba Tea House in Lee Lee's market place complex. Not anymore! This place also sells my favorite taro milk tea.   Finally, not only was the staff extremely friendly (almost overly friendly, but in a positive way), the donuts are delicious and fresh -- I'd recommend this place over the big chains (Dunkin Donuts, Krispy Kreme) any day! Extremely cheap, but be aware: They will not accept credit or debit cards for purchases under $3.    5 stars in my book!

I received an undercooked chicken sandwich from this location which even had blood in it, which seriously concerns me, as I was pregnant at the time and would rather not get sick with salmonella.   I called the shift manager to explain the incident to him and he offered me a refund and to talk to the cook. I didn't take the refund because I was at home and was not prepared to drive the several miles back to the restaurant.   Not only did I lose my dinner for the night, I lost my appetite altogether and peace of mind.   The French fries were good, but I don't think I'll be able to come back after the undercooked chicken sandwich.

The staff here is extremely helpful. We came in several times to checkout the strollers and car seats, and essentially had an employee dedicated to helping us for 30 mins-an hour.   The only reason for a docked star is because I feel the prices are generally marked up quite high--an issue which you have at most baby stores (babies r us, buybuybaby, etc). Some things are better to by on amazon, and whereas others are competitively priced!

This is one of the better Starbucks in the area that I've been frequenting after giving up on the store at Gilbert Rd., and Chandler Heights.   While this store is better, the employees here aren't great at customizing drinks. I always order extra matcha in my green tea lattes and very rarely receive it. I've started using the new mobile ordering, and today I noticed that again my drink was too milky. When I asked the gal if she'd put 7 scoops in she was like, "Oh. That's what you wanted? I didn't know what it said"... I'm posting a picture of my mobile order receipt, which is very clear and concise. If the employees cannot read the drink names and orders that come through, perhaps additional training is needed....  8/6/15 update: I've had consistent issues with this Starbucks and the most basic drinks on the menu are often made incorrectly or not as requested and have to be re-made 50% of the time. I've spoken to the store manager about this on several occasions -- the employees here are NOT properly trained and it impacts their customers.

I was really excited to try this place but was disappointed once I finally did.   We ordered the old fashioned oatmeal and french toast with a side of fruit. All around the food was just "OK"-- the side of fruit was a few blueberries, two graphed, and a cup of musk melon. If I came again, I would skip food here all together.   I ordered a butternut squash mango smoothie, which they were out of so I followed up with an iced Almond flavored Latte--I was brought what looked like a curdled milk latte and took it back and was later informed it was made with almond milk instead of almond flavor and it was made again. The correct latte I received was super bitter, as if the shots sat for too long before being poured in.   My husband had a hot latte with sugar syrup and was happy with it. Maybe I'm more picky as a former barista of 3.5 years.   All in all, we won't be back. It may have just been today's staff, but I'd rather explore other places.

If you're able, avoid this location. There is one very sweet and friendly woman at the front desk who I've enjoyed to have help me, but there is another who is very rude (blonde woman with red highlights), even to elderly. Also, not only is she rude to patients, but she is constantly barking orders to her colleague.   This type of behavior always turns me off to a business--employees should not be condescending toward their colleagues in front of patients, it reflects poorly on the business and their training of staff.   My first time at this location, I was not permitted to wait anywhere else while my glucose test went on--this is a bit of an issue for me because I'm not supposed to be around children or elderly due to being in-immune to rubella. Instead, I was forced to sit in a packed waiting room for an hour and risk my life and my baby's (which I made clear to the staff who disregarded my needs completely).   The phlebotomist's at this location also seem to be generally inexperienced and/or students, which doesn't help make an unpleasant experience any better.

The staff and Dr. Jonathan are very friendly and welcoming, and the location is clean and well-maintained.   I ultimately had a short-lived attendance to this location because I wasn't very confident in the knowledge of pre-natal adjustments and variety of treatment available. Having come from another chiropractor (whom I loved but he was out of network and that becomes expensive very quickly), I felt uncomfortable with the amount of questions about what treatment my previous chiropractor did and being told that the treatment I could receive here is limited due to my pregnancy. Most of my appointment was filled by using a hand held massager on sore areas, which is something I could do myself at home, and I was told I should lay on an ice pack. This was not the same as the care and conversations I'd received from my previous chiropractor. I also felt uncomfortable because I noticed my pain increasing after my adjustments here, and cancelled all future appointments as a result.   However, for non-pregnant patients, I can see how this may be a good location for them.   Personally, if I come to a doctor, being told that there's little you can do for me makes me feel that you are inexperienced in this particular area, especially when another doctor was able to do much more.

I have always enjoyed coming to Menchie's since moving to the Chandler/Gilbert area, but today sealed the deal for me!   After recently watching the "Undercover Boss" for Menchie's, I'd been craving a cup but didn't have time to stop by. Today was a special day for me, so I thought it'd be a nice day for a treat.   I came in and the gentleman working was very friendly, definitely a manager... Possibly the franchisee (speculation on my part). Anyway, as us ladies tend to share exciting things, I shared my exciting news with him and he I return made my day even more special!   The yogurt is good at this location and the frequently change the flavors and the fruit is always fresh--add great service to that and there's no excuse not to stop in for a cup of Froyo!

Overall, decent meal. We ordered take away and cannot comment on the service, although our order was ready within 20 minutes.   The salmon and risotto dish was delicious with a fresh and zesty sauce, but the sauce and risotto was more rich and creamy than my diet is used to. I recommend ordering the sauce on the side so that you can dress the salmon according to your taste.    The lobster Mac and cheese was every bit as comforting and delicious as other yelpers have indicated. The portion is huge and can be shared as a side between 4-5 adults.   The gumbo was not as good as the rest of the meal and I would only rate it 2/5 stars.   I look forward to trying other foods from this restaurant in the future.

Delicious food without the long wait! Meals are ready to go within 15 minutes. Ample customization options are available to meet everyone's preferences and dietary needs.   I love the vermicelli dishes - grilled shrimp is the perfect addition. The side salad that comes with the vermicelli is great--super fresh and crispy vegetables, with decent variety. My husband enjoys the fried rice dishes with tofu and chicken.   Fresh ingredients, quick and friendly service, great location, what more can I ask for?

This is a new location so naturally everything inside is new and well kept. The wait staff is friendly and very attentive, despite being overwhelmed during their peak hours they did a good job at checking in on guests regularly. The food and wait times were standard for IHOP, which is decent quality for the money spent.   Our only hiccups were with the waiting area and table -- as is the case with most restaurants, there is very limited space to sit/stand while you wait for a table. Being in the final weeks of my pregnancy, sitting outside in the sun during the AZ summer is quite difficult, but at the same time there was no space to sit or even stand inside. Once we got a table for two, the table was quickly filled up with coffee cups and water, leaving little room to maneuver while eating. Despite this, the server brought two additional glasses of water although there was no space (he was trying to push our plates and stuff while we were eating to make more space..) and they weren't yet needed - we sent them back.   Aside from that everything is great. I recommend coming to this location - I normally get turned off from IHOP due to sanitation and cleanliness which was not the case here!
