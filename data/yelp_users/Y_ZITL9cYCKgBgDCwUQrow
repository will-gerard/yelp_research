I have been here a few times, but mainly at dinner.  Dinner Has always been great, great waiters and staff, with a LCD TV playing almost famous famous bolywood movies.  LOL  It cracks me up when they dance.....LOL...anyhow, Great vegetarian choices for people who eat there veggies, but trust me, I am a MEAT eater,  Chicekn Tika masala, Little dry but still good.  My favorite is there Palak Paneer. Great for the vegetarian.  I have also tried there lunch Buffet for 11.00.  I give a Thumbs up..  Good, serve yourself, and pig out!!!!!!

I am a meat eater and I love anything juicy and fulfilling!!!!  I decided to wonder in, after a day basquing in the sun all day at the resorts waterpark.  the View is amazing, the smell of the damn cattle in front of the door, unpleasent.  But once you pass that, walk in thru a mine like entrance , almost upwards a tight shaft, then you are greeted my sweet gals that offer you to either walk down the stairs to your table, or slide down the slide.  I chose to slide down the slide, in short shorts..oooopssssies camel toe.  ;)  Old wood floors covered in sawdust and men in cowboy hats.  There is a live band playing while kids are dancing around having a blast.   The theme is working....  We have a great seat over looking central phoenix.  AMAZING!!!!!   Geoff and I decided to order the HUGE SAMPLER which almost bascially has everything on the menu.  21.00 a person.  Great choice and damn I was full!!!!!!  I would actually love to take someone on a date here.....great atmosphere and positive energy!!!  Btw you have to try the snake!!! to die for!

I don't venture out of Phoenix that often but this place is hot for Peoria AZ. Reverse happy hour is DIRT cheap, but taste like a 5 star restaurant!   Waitress are attentive never let our group of 15 hang.  I had a drink in hand a gay joke to tell every time.  :)  I had few things on  the happy hour menu, Of course the spicy tuna roll, simple, nice down that, calimari strips, not over cooked just right, maybe a little salty but super good, and I had there spicy chicken wings, which honestly was a little spicy for my taste, even though I like my Sh#^ hot!!!  Each item I orderd was under $5 bucks.  Amazing deal.  Well then you had the drinks which were also on happy hour where incredible cheap...compared to your sister city SCOTTSDALE....  With my food and my 4 drinks I forked out a merely 30 bucks which is nothing......GREAT PLACE TO GO!!!!   BTW awesome di!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Came here for a late night bite and for a corporate place I've never known a place to close early? Drive thru. Hours said ther open till 00:01? Makes no sense but online said ther. Open till 11:00pm we arrived at 10:34 waited at the voice box for five minutes drove up To the window and was ushered away by the window guy saying they were closed very disappointed in the customer service and the nonchalant gesture that was given to us to go away

Lunch for under $4.00?  You bet you.  Super cheap lunch from 11-2pm tues-sunday.  I usually get out of there with a Bento box with Chicken, rice, salad, and slices of oranges for $3.75 and a Tuna Roll for $3.50,  Super cheap!!  I heard dinner is exquisite.

A good ol' neighborhood Gay bar, nested in the back of Park Central Mall Cheap Drinks, Friendly service, and walking distance from the light rail.

A hidden gem underneath the escalator at the Arizona center.  I always wanted to have dinner here but I was always in a rush to see a movie.  I finally made dinner plans with my volleyball team to check it out.  A young gentleman by the name of Jarrod waited on us and all I have to say "What a delight."  I tried the steam mussels accompanied by the lobster lettuce cups.  Both items were perfectly prepared!  My team and will definitely come back again, Especially to see Jarrod!

For starters...I was never a big boba fan or halo halo fan.  This place is amazing!!  I had a Thai Tea Boba, Let me tell you the bomb digg-addy!!!!  LOL .  Besides there normal Filipino dishes it is a must have.  Then I stuffed my face with Dinuguan, a Filipino savory stew mixed with your typically stomach, intestines, ears, heart and snout of a pig,  simmered in a rich, spicy dark gravy of pig blood, garlic, vinegar, and chili.  SARAP!!!!   ( delish is Tagalog)  along with a side of rice and your good to go!!!!!  Next order to come out was a Lechon (roasted pig) along with the sauce.  Just like my mothers cooking.  I was at home..  Dinuguan is not for everyone, as kids we knew it at chocolate meat, because the sauce is curdled blood which turns dark brown to black when cooked.  The sound of it really "Erks" your stomach, but the taste is out of this world!!!   They have many different dishes all you have to do is "point point"    If you love ethnic cultural world dishes you will appreciate this place.

I have only been here during REVERSE happy hour and I am loving it!!  This reminds me of some hip Sushi Bar in NYC.  $5 sushi rolls?  You bet along side a $3 plate of calamari.  Always hits the spot.  Besides the cheap eats, the decor is fantastic!  Modern Buddah statues paired with Herman Miller Wire chairs, incredible.

LA FITNESS?  You ask?  Well I rate you a two, due to the unclean restrooms, feet smelling locker rooms, un air-conditioned dressing rooms.  Trust, who wants to walk into a locker room and walk out like you were in a sauna.  ugh!!  I visit you, only for the fact that it is conveniently close to my work and my home, and I have a killer rate.  I did not rate you a 1 because the staff is very nice and welcoming.

I stop here at least 3 times a week.  Inexpensive, so great for the budget conscious person, but taste like a 4 star meal.  The Pho Broth is perfect every time.  This place is always packed with a mix of people,  I just wish the servers were a little bit more friendlier.

A fantasic spot to have a bite to eat, and grab a drink with your friends.  First Friday is always Jammed packed with all kinds of people from straights, gays, hipsters, the local, and the people watchers.  Great open patio with lots of room to mingle.  I would totally recommend stopping here.

Great location, but I have to say that the food, not so good.  I have visited this place two times and tried different types of meals.  First time I had a spicy tuna roll with Jalepenos and the the rice was extra warm which should be at room temperature, then I had the the Reman noodle with pork.  The Noodles were under cooked, stiff like chalk and the broth was SO-SO.....  Second time around I had Chicken Katsu which was over cooked, hard, and barely any chicken I felt like I was eating bread crumbs. and the soup was luke warm.  Just not my cup of tea.  NYC and SFO have better places and so much more REASONABLE..  The second time around my meal nearly cost me $19.  Comparable to Kyoto bowl but double in price.  :/
