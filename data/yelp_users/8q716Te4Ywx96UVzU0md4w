Great food, great drinks, great atmosphere, AND a great staff! Say whaaaaaaaaaat?!?!?    I had a brief, but torrid affair with the grilled cheese, and that delicious SOB left me wanting more!    I HIGHLY recommend this spot!!!

The food was pretty good - the salsa was SUUUUUUUUUPER HOT and deelish!!!    The service?  Blegh...made us feel as if we were putting her out by asking for more iced tea, soda, whatevs.  No warmth, friendliness, nothin'!  Girlfriend made me miss out on some flan because we feared we would never see her again or would have to wait 15-20 minutes for her to get it...and you don't make me miss out on flan +serious face+.  Would go back again, but will not go at the same time...

Pardon my french, but this repair shop is the T!TS!!!    I took my Mini (hereto known as Gracie) to the dealership because the A/C wasn't working...let's not discuss me running into something head on thus jacking up the entire front-end and most inner-workings...they wanted to charge me $4,000+!!!  Exsqueeze me?  Bakin' powder???    So began my search on Yelp for a repair shop.  I decided to check them out based on the reviews, and boy was I not disappointed!  Not only did they come back with a cheaper price, but they found a couple other things the dealership didn't find, which they fixed for only a smidge more than what was originally quoted!  Gracie's happy, I'm happy, and life is good :)  Thanks for saving me some chedduh so that I may make it raaaaaaain :)

Orale!  This place is GREAT!  Ask the cab/UBER/Lyft driver to swing by this joint late night, after the bar...PERFECT drunky-pants food :)

Don't eat here unless you're unbelievably desperate, completely devoid of tastebuds, or have a condition where you must eat at a food joint that is mostly employed by d-bags. Went here with a friend last night and not only were we ignored when ready to order, there was a tension so thick you could pour it over a stack of pancakes. The cashier and one more employee actually decided to help us while the immature little boys behind the counter were F'ing about. The owner/manager/whatever needs to reevaluate his or her hiring methods.   Now for the food...I didn't eat my sandwich, honestly, for fear of them spitting in it. Yes, we took a long time to figure out what we wanted, but was the attitude we received necessary or justified? I ate the ham, from my ham and Swiss, after close inspection for any indication of saliva. It was super processed, so I finally ended up just eating 3 cookies (I REGRET NOTHIIIIING!!) to be safe. The chicken Alfredo my friend got was pretty good, but the chicken on top looked pink and as if it came from a can.   In the immortal words of Dave Chappelle, "I wish I had more hands so I could give those t!tt!es four thumbs down!" Suck it, this location...suck it hard...

Should I do it?...I'm gonna do it...buuuuut...yeah, I'm gonna do it...this place is PHO real!!! There...but I'm seriously...it's legit. AND peep this, yo: they have coconut water STRAIGHT from a coconut...like your cup IS a coconut...that ish is tight...the service is very Seinfeld "Soup Nazi"-esk, but I'm willing to deal with that if it means I get to mow down on some deliciousness. Looking forward to eating here again!

Horrible place to take your car for service!  I can't tell you how many things they've screwed up, and to top it off, they don't tell me they're going to do a diagnostic check on my car until after they do it.  So, I had to kiss $179 goodbye.  They've lost a customer fo. sho.

I am officially in LOVE! We went here for my friend's birthday - just three of us - and had the best time. You pick 2-3 tapas per person and just share away. We had our server pair wine with each course, and he was spot on!!!! Pinot paired with the blackberry spinach salad and hummus, a lovely cab paired with three amazing pizzas...and the sparkling ros√© was perfectly matched with the wonderful desserts we ordered...mmmm...I almost fainted from the pure ecstasy that is their risotto.  Decently priced and a great atmosphere :) we were extremely pleased.  Can't wait to come here again and again!  Btdubs, Sean (spelling?), our server, was the best!! Accommodating, knowledgeable, and so nice!!!!   A great dining experience!!!

Now, I'm not a violent person, but let's just say I would step on my beloved boyfriend's neck to get to their desserts. Lemon bars? Oh yeah...pie????? Oh heeeeeeells yeah!! Fresh, perfectly sweet and simply delightful.  Besides the yummy tasty treats, we also enjoyed a couple of their breakfast items. Their French toast with a berry compote is two little slices of heaven. Do not get me started on their bacon...bacon dot YEAH!!!!   I can't wait to go here again to sample many more of their dishes. We'll probably go so often it will be like Cheers up in that piece...NORM!!!

This place is officially dead to me...DEAD TO ME, I TELLS YA!!!  I've given them a few chances now, but after today...DONE!  I went in, and there of course was a long line (hello...lunchtime!).  I get that.  I go to the counter, order, try to pay and, according to them, my credit card is declined...I try two more...DECLINED!...okay, weird, but it's getting a bit mortifying at this point and the line is getting longer.  So, I pay with cash. Move on...I get my order (a Slim sammy which does not include anything except meat and/or cheese - that's it!), bring it back to work...there's lettuce, tomato and onion on it...um...exsqueeze me?...oh and by the by, each and everyone of my cards has available funds on it, so what the french...  I guess if I want a sammy from now on, Duck and Decanter, here I come!

Such a big fan of this place.  My bf and I went here last night, to grab a drink and some food.  He's moving out here in a month, so we want to start trying out places to become our future haunts :)  We both felt this one would be visited on the reg!  The service was spectacs, let me just tell you.  On point, considerate, everything always topped off, empties immediately taken away - you can't get much better!  The food was tiiieeeeeeeght!  Any place with a charcuterie plate has my vote f'SHO!  We split that, the rigatoni, The Earl flatbread, AND the au gratin potatoes...if we weren't already bringing home so many leftovers, I would have asked for a second helping, to go.  That sh!ts was legits.  The ONLY thing I would change is more chairs and less bar stools.  I could have sunk in a little deeper if there were more chairs...good thing?  Bad thing?  You choose :)
