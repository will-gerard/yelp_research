This is definitely an efficient business with friendly staff and a timely schedule! Dr. Thomas is really nice and often gives a lot of helpful tips to his patients so it's obvious he knows his stuff and that you're in good hands. They don't joke around here and are serious about treating their patients and helping them. Overall I've enjoyed being a patient here thus far and recommend it.

Coffee was sub-par at best. I asked for 2 Splenda packets in my latte and the cashier refused to put them in my coffee and told me to do it myself. My friend asked for cream cheese with her bagel and when they told her they were out, she asked if they had peanut butter and they told her no and that she would "just have to use butter." Service far below sub-par...

I've been to this Starbucks a few times because it's the closest to my house but GOOD GOD it is the SLOWEST starbucks I've ever been too!!! If you go inside, expect to wait at least 15 minutes after you order for even the most basic drink (an iced tea or iced coffee even!). I get so frustrated every time I come to this Starbucks because it is such a painfully slow experience. Not sure what makes this Starbucks so slow but I've never waited less than 10 minutes between ordering and receiving my drink.

Mojo Yogurt often has a great variety of tasty flavors as well as a wide array of toppings! The atmosphere is pleasant and the yogurt is delicious! Plus it's open late! My only complaint is that the yogurt melts so quickly!! It's soup within 5 minutes.
