When I first went in to see their business I waited 15+ minutes alone in their seeing area before I had to go into the garage just to flag somebody down, and he took his time coming into the room to see what I needed.  Not only that, but when I set my appointment, they set it for an hour ahead from what they told me so when I went in the 2nd time, they couldn't see me for an hour.  No apologies or anything.  Since I already purchased the groupon, I scheduled again for two days after and they wouldn't even acknowledge me when I came in.  I come from customer service and would've appreciated a, "Hold on just a minute and I'll be right with you.", but nothing.  They also took twice as long that they originally quoted me time-wise but didn't offer any apology, I had to go to the garage area again just to get an update.  Very poor customer service, I will not be going back to them again.

Okay, so this is super late in coming but Rob was FANTASTIC.  I had an extremely old, extremely temperamental, and decidedly incontinent cat who decided that my new $2,000 thick shag rug was the perfect litter box.  I tried bleach, scrubbing it, everything, but eventually the smell just stayed and life gets busy so I stopped... For almost 9 months.  Thankfully the floors were all tile so it didn't seep through the ground, but needless to say, that rug was a hot mess and I was moving in 3 months.  I'd read all the great reviews on yelp so decided to give him a try despite being a college student and not the richest of girls.  Not only did he give me a great deal, he re-scheduled and re-scheduled again as issues on my end came up, and we finallly set a date for a few days before moving out.  This way, the cats wouldn't be around to mess it up and it would be nice and fresh-smelling for the movers.  He came out and did his thing, and I'm not sure if you know this, but he'll take you out to show you exactly WHAT came out in the cleaning.  You couldn't even see water, it was dark brown all the way through.  DISGUSTING.  Oh my goodness.  So, anyway, the move came and I had fans blowing on it as directed, but because of how deep that rug was it didn't fully air out, and when it was rolled and stacked against a wall during the move, you could see urine LEAKING OUT.  I texted Rob and wanted to see how much it would be to do a second treatment because the smell was even WORSE than before it all accumulated to one side and he said when and where and picked it up NO CHARGE.  He picked up the rug, kept it at his house for days on end soaking it and re-soaking it, drying it out on his patio (This is a BIG rug), and finally returned it and it smells great!  I put my nose right up to the side she used to pee in and I can't smell anything, and he left bottles both for odor *and* for pet stains.  I can't recommend Rob enough.  Very affordable, friendly, flexible, he's the whole package!  Sorry about the wait, Rob, and thank you SO much again!  Sincerely,  One VERY satisfied customer.

I don't have a ton of experience with waxing (I think I've only been to 2 other people), but I definitely have an idea of what I like.  She was quick, efficient, friendly, flexible, and very knowledgeable!  It's never fun to go in for a wax, especially down there, but she made it as painless as possible and really got ALL the hair, which is something that other waxers can skimp on.  She also gave me great ideas on how to keep skin supple and natural ways to exfoliate.  5 stars!!!  Great experience.
