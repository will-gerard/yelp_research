Waited 2 hours in the waiting room and 4 additional hours to see a doctor. I had an allergic reaction and could barely breathe or walk. I know they have to help the more critical patients first. It was just really scary to go that long in a hospital without help.

We called ahead and had someone go to check us in  and get the little buzzer before we went because we didn't want to wait long for a table with 2 toddlers running around. We also had family with us from San Francisco. We were one big exhausted hungry group. I was told it would be a 20min wait. That's perfect. Good! Well 20min came and went. The kids were restless after 45min so I asked how much longer the wait would be. The hostess told me we were up to 8th on the list but it would still be at least an hour.  Seriously? If I had been told the actual wait time when I got there I would have said okay and just come back another time. We left and went down the road to a Hawaiian BBQ place with no wait that was delicious!

I'm visiting from Minnesota and went with my kids as a guest. The staff were friendly and didn't pressure me to get a membership which is nice because I only go to this gym a handful of times a year as a guest when I have time to kill. They gave me a guest locker card so I could lock my stuff up and I had no trouble checking the kids in as guests.  The kids went in the childcare area for an hour while I did cardio. The workout areas looked and smelled clean. It wasn't over crowded at all. We took the kids swimming afterwards. The pool is very toddler/kid friendly and the family locker rooms and showers were clean and convenient.

Such a fun free thing to do with the kids! My kids are 2 and 3. We ran around looking at all the animals and checked out the aquariums and awesome kids section. They let kids feed the trout everyday at 1:30!  I got them a kids meal to split in the restaurant. It was plenty of food for both kids and we sat right in front of a huge aquarium.   Staff were very friendly!

I took my kids last year when they were just 1 and 2 years old and we had a blast! The girl who took the kids on a pony was so good with the kids and they werent scared at all after she talked with them. She walked the pony in a couple circles while i held the kids on.  After that we went into the free petting zoo which had a lot of animals.  Weve already gone back 3x since last year and we live in MN

The friendly staff and fast service makes up for the fact that this location does not have a machine to print your own priority mail labels.  I came in with 4 packages that I wanted to print labels for and put in the drop bin. I had to wait in line and pay at the counter since they don't have the machine to do it yourself.  The line went fast and the worker gave my kids candy. I've already been back twice so I'll give it a 5 star review.
