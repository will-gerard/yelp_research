RYAN IS DA MAN!!!!!!!  Told him what I wanted in a Stereo, Alarm and Speakers.  I got a Pioneer deck with Touch Screen, 2 Pioneer 6x9's, Midrange & Tweeters along with a 10" SubWoofer.  Also got the Auto start with my Alarm.  THIS SYSTEM KICKS ASS and my Mom's first reaction when she heard me approach her place was "BOY YOU GONNA GET ARRESTED!!!!"  I was OVERLY HAPPY with what I got. Very professional look on the install and it work perfectly with my Steering Wheel controls.  The only thing I will say that I wished they would have done is put a GRATE on the SubWoofer. the Speaker protrudes from the box it could be damage if something fell into it.

This review is based on fast Great Service in the drive-thru but mostly because of the Garlic Cheddar Buttery Jack which is as my man Daym Drops puts it, "FIVE ALL DAY SON!!!!!"   This burger can beat most Burgers I have had most anywhere! Only only one place that even comes close is Burger Shop, this burger is Off Da Chain!!!!!

Got a coupon for a FREE CHICKEN Sandwich from the company because of another SCREW UP at another store.  When I order the Chicken Sandwich that costs $4.59 the guy tells me $1.69, I'M LIKE WTF!!!!!!!!!! Yes it does say you must pay the tax but what is the DAMN TAX on 4.59???????????????????????????????  I WILL NEVER GO TO CARL'S JR EVER AGAIN. Carl Jr is synonymous with a few choice CURSE WORDS I CAN THINK OF.

Lots of chips and salsa bought to your table up front. Beer not a lot on tap but ok. Watermelon Margaritas a hit with my bro and sis. Chicken quesadilla was delicious mine with Jalapeños. And of course the Fajitas are fantastic!!

I was pleasantly surprised when I walked into the door to see as many TV's as I did in one place. If you cant find the sports you are trying to watch at Santisi Bros, it aint on TV!! They got everything sports on screen, AWESOME! We had the Friday ALL-U-CAN-EAT Fish Fry and Boy did I LOVE THAT FISH!  It was breaded just like Fried Chicken Mom used to make, the Tarter sauce and the cocktail sauce was Perfect for the Fish! Only con about the meal was the French Fries, they were ok, but you definitely have to use Ketchup. I know a lot of places have fries that are so tasty that you dont need Ketchup, these are NOT those. Just like others have said its not a place to go if you are wanting to talk to someone or have a first date, it is VERY LOUD inside. The waitresses were very very pleasant and we felt very comfortable! Overall I would definitely recommend and I will be going back.

Got there for happy hour on Friday around 3pm, plenty of parking and places to sit. Very nice place, cool bar seating, and nice booths. TV's everywhere. We started out with Edamame, Spring Rolls, Calamari, and Volcano Chicken appetizers. All of these were delicious.COWGIRL Sushi which was spicy yellowtail roll topped with sliced yellowtail, spicy mayo and Sriracha, garnished with scallions. I'm not much on Sushi but this was very good! Finished off with their Crispy Wings a dozen crispy chicken wings tossed in a sweet spicy asian sauce served with wasabi ranch, these are Da Bomb!! We go here a lot because of these wings! Cooked perfectly and the Asian sauce is so delightful. House Cab and Tsing Tao to was it down made it a perfect afternoon!

Every time I go to Pappadeaux  I get the item on the Appetizer menu, Large order of Fried Alligator.  I always ask that I get half Fried and half Blackened Cajun.  Take a piece dip it in that AMAZING sauce that it comes with and be prepared to know what HEAVEN IS LIKE!!!  I just LOVE this dish so much that I get it at least once a month if not more. And anytime I go to a Pappadeaux's Resturant I get this dish.  ITS UNBELIEVABLE!!!!

This place has become a Favorite of mine, from the bathrooms to the AWESOME service, to the overly delicious Food, Ling & Louie's is a Big Hit!  The Chicken Lettuce Wraps blow the pants off of  PF Chang's.  And during Happy Hour they are 5 bucks along with the Crispy Calamari which was the BEST tasting Calamari I've had anywhere! We also tried the tacos, Both the Firecracker Chicken and the Ahi Poke explode flavors all through your mouth leaving you wanting more and more. The tacos came with an Awesome tasting Fried Rice for a $1 more I believe, steamed rice white or brown are the other choices to go with your Tacos.  We washed it all down with the with a warm flavored Inkberry Shiraz Cabernet & a Great tasting Kona Brewing Co. "Big Wave" Golden Ale. Prices are Right on Time during Happy and I am a fan for life of this restaurant.  If you can get a seat in Amanda's area you will be treated King and Queen. She knows a lot about everything on the Menu and almost all the drinks. She and the rest of the staff seem to enjoy their jobs and walk around with lots of Smiles! Management came to check with us after our meal and I pretty much told him I be back and others will too!

Went on a Saturday evening its was a little crowded, not too long of a wait, but a wait well worth it! Brewhouse Blonde beer set the pace along with the Roasted Caramelized Brussel Sprouts that were AMAZING!!! Fried Artichoke Hearts were good too. Then I had the 5 Meat Deep Dish pizza with Jalapeños, onions and Roasted Garlic, OMG!!! The pizza is off the Richter Scale!! The Menu has so much to choose from its hard to decide, but BJ's is a happening Spot!!!!

I wanted to give this McDonalds NO STARS, but I didn't know if I could.  Anyway, if you want your order WRONG, this is the place to be!! I have gone here on many occasions and out of 10 orders, 8 have been wrong. Be careful when Ordering a Sausage McMuffin, you will GET EGG PUT ON IT THERE.  I even took my order back and they gave me the same thing again WITH EGG, when I specifically said SAUSAGE MCMUFFIN!!!  I love all people and I am not racist but, if you gonna work in AMERICA you gotta not only SPEAK English, but UNDERSTAND it too!!!

I wanted to share an update about this McDonalds because the Manager Obviously cares about what folks are saying. I was presented with a number of Coupons and a letter apologizing for the bad service. Since then I've there a couple times and my order has been taken and provided without ANY FLAWS!!  Great job and KUDOS to the Mangers for fixing all issues.

It was a good time to go around 1:45 or so when we got there. Not many people there, great view inside Ice Den watching people do triple axles and such. Waitress helped us right away and very nice looking I must say. Food came fairly quickly was hot and delicious! I had the BBQ bacon burger with jalapeños and Onion Rings. I'd say probably a good tie for the best burger I ever had, I'm still partial to The Burger Shop. Restaurant is a great place for happy hour and the prices are way affordable, not to mention one of the cleanest looking restaurants I've ever seen. I definitely recommend 18 Degrees for Food, fun and excitement!

I arrive at the stores Drive Thru at 5:55am call the store and immediately I feel like I'm at Rocky Point or something, I don't speak Spanish. That alone kinda threw me for a loop, they finally took my order at 6:01am and the only good thing that happened on this breakfast run was they knew what a Loaded Croissanwich was. I was surprised, when I got to work and opened it I was surprised again that any employee of Burger King would serve this to a customer, TWO THUMBS DOWN Burger King!!!!!!!

Red was our server and she is a ROCK STAR!!! Sunday of course is busier than most days, so took I little bit to get our food, but WELL WORTH the WAIT!! Food was hot and delicious!! The Grand Slamich is a breakfast sandwich with Ham, crumbled bacon and Sausage. Adding onions to it and my hash browns just set the meal off! Mom gave me her soft well cooked pancakes with the warm delicious maple syrup, YUMMY!!!

Bonefish Grille was a Lovely Spot to take a Date. Very classy on the inside and all the waiters and waitresses were very Professional and very cordial. Staff was very knowledgable with the Drink and Food Menus. A very large Wine list and other alcoholic beverages. We started off with Appetizers the Wagyu Beef & Ginger Potstickers and the Bang Bang Shrimp which was simply Delicious!!! The Wagyu Beef melts in your mouth. We shared the Lobster Bisk and Lobster Grilled Cheese not something I would order a lot but it was ok. We also shared the Blackened Baja Street Tacos which were off da Hook!! We washed it down with a Blue Moon for me and a Winter White Cosmopolitan for her, Both drinks were very tasty!!!  Over all I would definitely recommend them, prices a little on the upscale but well worth it.
