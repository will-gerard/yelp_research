I've been coming here for years and it's always a must stop when I'm visiting family in Arizona. The House Special Chicken is one of my all time favorite dishes and it always tastes the same. No corners being cut at this place.  I love China Chili. Seriously, I LOVE China Chili!

Great firm. Even better people. I've used Antonio's law firm in the past and all I can say is WOW! Talk about breaking the stereotype of your common attorney. He's honest, organized, thoughtful and caring to his clients needs.  He handled a business transaction I had with the city of Phoenix years ago for me and it was absolutely effortless.  My business was being relocated due to the light rail and the city wanted to withhold a large portion of my settlement until they settled and finalized a buyout with my landlord. Completely unacceptable as my landlord was disputing the acquisition of his property and would likely have tied the matter up in court for years. Antonio got it settled for me in a matter of days. You can't ask for anymore then that, I've returned to Arizona and I'm currently using his services again and I'll continue to use the services of Antonio and Victoria.   Thanks

I just got done eating another shitty taco in Illinois. It made me realize how great  the Mexican Food is in Arizona.  Carolina's is in the holy grail category: it could very well be my last meal on earth and I'd die with a smile on my face.

I appreciate the response from management but this was a very disappointing meal. I didn't touch the rice and you can see how small of a portion I was given, the sauce was watery and tasted terrible. I dropped $30 in your restaurant and with all due respect, that's not a mistake I'm willing to make again. Arizona is loaded with quality Mexican Restaurants so unfortunately it's one strike and you're out.   I've  been going to Macayo's for decades and I always thought the food was good. Not sure what happened tonight but the sauce for my chimi was horrendous and inedible. I picked it apart trying to salvage any portion but finally gave up. I've been living in Chicago for the last decade so I'm not sure if it was a bad night or a change in quality over the years but either way this is not the place I remember.    Disappointed :(

25 years. I've been a loyal customers of Buono's Pizza for 25 years.   Here's a hint guys, reheating an old pizza that's probably been sitting around for a few hours intended for slices isn't going to keep me coming back.  It's inexcusable for a restaurant to serve what I was served this evening. This wasn't a mistake: overcooked/undercooked it's giving a customer garbage because you don't want to take a loss on a product.    Will not return. Ever.

Shit was so bad I was afraid to feed it to my dog. This is the second Popeyes in Arizona I've been to and they've both been TERRIBLE.  Whoever handles the territories should be fired immediately,   Poor quality and awful management.

This is one of those places I hold very close to heart. I grew up eating here and anytime I come back to the valley it's a must stop. Today was that day and I can only say it's as good as it ever was.  Old school, Arizona style mexican cuisine at its finest.  Thank you Rosita's for staying true to your roots and never compromising your quality.  5 stars isn't enough but all I can give.

A great place to watch UFC fights. It's a $5 cover and I swear the place has over 100 HD tv's. The foods solid and the service has been great every time and that's saying something considering the place is standing room only.

I haven't been to PVL in over a decade and I've never been here sober.  Place hasn't changed much but I think It might be a tad cleaner. Bathroom wasn't repulsive.   The live music was great although the sound in that place blows. Will definitely return to see some great local bands.    Palo Verde Lounge is a  Tempe institution. Great local metal and thrash scene.  Don't be scared it's not that bad.

Terrible.  Took a chance on this place for Mother's Day and wish we hadn't. The service was non existent and the food was average at best. Prices are on the high side and that would be ok if the food were on par, it's not. Here's a hint to ownership. If you're going to play the part of upscale Italian Bistro and try and get me for an extra $4 for a dinner salad don't have the host who seats us wearing gym shoes( dirty ), acid washed jeans and a wrinkled black T shirt.

I'm writing this as I walk throughout the store right now. This place is fantastic. It's got anything and everything you could possibly imagine when it comes to Mexican/New Mexican/Southwestern ingredients. Store is clean, well organized and the quality is phenomenal. I've been on a quest to learn how to make the perfect salsas and tacos while living in Illinois. Not easy to find the ingredients needed  but that's NOT the case here.  So nice to be home!

I've never eaten here sober until last night. How is this place in business with multiple locations throughout the valley? I'm at loss for words to really describe how terrible the food is.   And they've got the nerve to be expensive.

Worthy of the hype in every way imaginable. Our server, Dick, was a true professional and took our dining experience to a new level.  The table side guacamole was excellent. I settled on the Pescado Veracruz and quite frankly it was as close to perfect as I could expect a meal to be. Yes it's a little pricey but the quality and creativity of the dishes justifies it.

Dropped $300 on the Seahawks so I needed to drown my sorrows in something. About 3pounds of King Crab did the trick and washed it down with some Chicken Wellington.  Overall I'd say this is easily the best buffet in Vegas. $37 ain't cheap but it's on par with most.

Not to happy. I had fond memories of Dilly's and was looking forward to a long overdue return to what I once considered to be a true 5 star gem.  Unfortunately, nothing stood out about this visit. The soup was ok but the bread bowl it's served in was dry and probably a few days old. I'm not sure how busy they are but it looked like enough bread for a few days, they  have bags and bags of bread everywhere throughout the kitchen.  The sandwich was fine, meat and veggies were fresh but the bread was very overcooked on one side , almost burnt but not quite.   The young man who was working the front was very helpful and polite but someone needs to teach this kid some entry level sanitation skills. He was helping himself to a bowl of soup and was licking his fingers and hand. Gross. As I walking out the door I noticed he was enjoying his soup while seated on a food prep table. Management needs to get there act together and properly train their staff and ensure that health codes are being followed.  I won't be running back to Dilly's anytime soon.

$6 burgers on Monday night be the best $6 burger I've ever had. Any burger on the menu for six bucks. Excellent presentation and cooked perfectly. The fresh cut fries were very very good not great  but close.   Our server, Alex did a great job. He was curtious , prompt and never rushed us even towards the end of the evening.

If McDonald's got into the steakhouse business it would be Logan's. The Mac and Cheese is basically KRAFT, the mashed potatoes and gravy are instant/canned. The rice pilaf I was originally served with my meal was literally scraped out of the pan to make one final order. I just dropped $27 and you're serving me garbage. I understand this is not Ruth Chris but give me a break and have an ounce of respect for the people you're serving. My Porterhouse was low quality and as other reviewers have said very chewy, my mother ordered the salmon and she said it was ok although her broccoli was "mushy"   If someone gave me a gift certificate to this place i'd re gift it someone I hate. Never again under any circumstance. F*** this place.

Back in the day this was my favorite place to stay. It's a great location and a quick walk to some of the best properties. Unfortunately it's getting run down and it doesn't seem they are making the effort to keep the place clean or inviting.  Super Bowl weekend and they had some sort of water leak on one of the floors. Bally's solution was taping the area off and placing an empty garbage can under the leak for 16 hours, the smell got so bad we left and went to Bellagio.  Maybe they're getting ready to blow this dump up?

Woohoo! As good as it gets!   Seriously, the food here is outstanding. I read the reviews and was a little bit skeptical about how good it could be.  In all honesty, it's as good as it gets in my opinion. As good as El Molino in Scottsdale used to be before it was sold. Eat here.

I was excited to take a few friends here that are big fans of New Mexican Cuisine. I ordered my standard, a Grilled Chicken  Chimmichanga with Green chile, no beans and extra rice. Not being a fan of re fried beans I was disappointed and shocked when my Chimmi arrives and it's filled with chicken and beans.  I spoke to a man who must have been the owner/manager and told him I'd been here many times before and it never had beans in it.  He told me they always come with beans and I must have ordered something different on my prior visits. Not true, I always order the grilled chicken and it's NEVER  had beans in it. It was getting close to an argument and figured I'd take the higher road since he reluctantly agreed to replace the meal. Food comes out and it's as good as ever. The manager/owner comes back over to my table to ask if everything was ok and I responded with a smile and yes. I guess he felt it was necessary to once again explain to me that I had ordered incorrectly and to make sure I specify that I didn't want re fried beans.   I politely explained  that I had, that on my previous 5 visits it NEVER had beans and pointed out to him that  nowhere on his menu did it say that beans were standard filling.   Just a quick message to ownership. The food at your restaurant is outstanding, as good as I've found throughout the valley but the attitude I experienced today really makes me not want to return.   5 stars for the food and 1 for the service.

I like this place a lot. I always get a veggi burger and onion rings and I've yet to be disappointed. Affordable and clean with a simple menu that's got options for everyone. I'd say the most impressive part of this location was the manager. Young guy with a full sleeve tattoo not only provided outstanding customer service to every guest but single handily kept the entire restaurant clean at a very busy lunch rush.  This has become my stand bye for a quick meal.

How about teaching your cooks to 1) clean the oven properly 2) don't burn the pizza. I understand it's a coal burning oven but dry and burnt on the bottom is not how this pizza is supposed to be. I should have uploaded a picture but I'd rather just say F**K this place.

The venue itself is beautiful but please do something about your staff/security. Is it really neccassry to hire a bunch of wanna be cops/MMA fighters that eye fuck everyone? I get that some of the shows can get a little "aggressive" but the staff honestly seems to antagonize more than they actually do their jobs.

Nice local burger joint.   Simple menu and pretty plain decor but that's fine with me. The focus is obviously on the food as it should be with a small place like this. In a city with a chain on every corner The Stand sets itself apart with its French Fries. These are French Fries not soggy, greasy fresh cut fries like 5 guys.  Most likely soaked in water for hours to remove the starch and double cooked to make them crispy. Dare I say they are using Kennebec Potatoes?   My mother had the burger and I ordered the tacos. The burger looked like a In N Out/ Shake Shack hybrid and she said it was fantastic. The tacos were ok, next time I'll order a burger and likely add the last star. It's priced right and the service was EXCELLENT, great friendly staff!

Great selection. I needed to upgrade my typical blue jean and black T-shirt wardrobe. Out with the black and in with white.  They have a huge selection and all of the best brands. Picked up a few pairs of jeans and some shirts at a pretty good price.   I'm cheap so I'll return:)

Foods great and the prices are out of this world. The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars? Standing  in line  for 30 minutes is not something I'd do again, this place is BUSY.  FIRED PIE has so overgrown this tiny space it's the only drawback to an otherwise great establishment.  $7.95 for an 11" pizza with fresh ingredients is ridiculous.  This might be the best dollar for dollar value establishment I've ever been to. I really can't stress that enough.  When Burger21 goes belly up in a few months jump on that space .  Great place.

I love food. I really love sandwiches. I  have lived in some great places with exceptional food and I  can honestly say that the Pilgrim might just be the best sandwich I've ever eaten. That's a pretty bold claim to make considering I've eaten at some legendary sandwich institutions throughout the U.S. But I feel comfortable saying it.  It's that friggin good.

Outstanding New York Style Pizza. Perfectly soft/chewy crust. Great cheese that melts perfectly and Browns up nicely in the oven. The price? FOURTEEN BUCKS for an 18" cheese! This place BLOWS  Buono's out of the water and it's fresh.   Highly recommended and I'm ecstatic that I finally found a quality pizza in my neck of the woods.

I feel comfortable updating this review. I waited a few months to give them another opportunity. So tonight I try ordering a pizza for delivery and of course La Famiglia is apparently so busy that they refuse to take my order an hour prior to closing. I was told and I quote  "any delivery order needs to be called in by 7:30 so they can catch up."  I have tried unsuccessfully to order food from this place THREE times. I have no choice but to  say **** this place and you're better off going somewhere else.  Will not return and can not recommend.

Now I remember why I never come to this place.  Soup? Tiny portion and tasted like Campbell's. Bread bowl? Hard as a rock. Salad? Wilted greens and 2, 1.5 ounce portions of dressing that were each 60% full. Goodbye $23. Xxxx you Panera.

Way to much salt on everything and I like salt but this was over the top. I was looking forward the the veggie fries but I couldn't eat more than a few. The chicken was fatty, really fatty and flavorless aside from the layer of salt. My friend raves about the burgers so maybe that's the way to go....   Honest to god I wouldn't eat here again for free. Gross.

I enjoyed this place quite a bit. I recently relocated back to Arizona after living outside of Chicago for the past 10 years. I'm quite familiar with Italian Beef having owned and operated a Chicago Style Eatery for 7 years. I think Johnny's is an excellent representation of true Chicago Style food. The Italian Beef was excellent and the sweet peppers were done right. The burger? Outstanding, they use the smash and scrape technique ala Shake Shack and it leaves a beautiful crust and flavor on the burger that a char grill just can't replicate. I didn't care for the fries hence  leaving off the fifth star but I'd definately recommend this place to anyone for a damn good burger and excellent Italian Beef.
