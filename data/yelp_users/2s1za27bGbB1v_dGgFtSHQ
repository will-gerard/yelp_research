Great place; location is perfect especially if you're an ASU student.  Price and overall quality of the food is fantastic.  The buffet is always fully stocked and fresh. The restaurant is clean with excellent staff.  The food is absolutely phenomenal; flavor, freshness, quality, & quantity are all to be expected every time you go in.  You can't beat the price, especially for everything you get.  Definitely recommend!

We arrived 4:30 PM (the door was opened with a chair) and the owner was laying on the chairs with his feet up on the table, in the dining room, on the phone and told us they're closed until 5 PM.  I can't say anything about their food but I can say their service is atrocious. Good luck to those who come here in the future, I hope they clean the tables for their guests sake.
