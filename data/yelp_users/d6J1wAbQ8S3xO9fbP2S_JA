Good local watering hole. I like the casual atmosphere, if you go on weekend nights you get the younger hipsterish crowd. Service is always good and the drinks aren't watered down. Try the fried mushrooms with ranch!!

Favorite casual pizza place! I always get the pesto chicken slice and a Greek salad. The pizza is great if you like the New York style where it's thin but not so crispy that it doesn't flop down. Salads are fresh, I've had the wings as well and they're okay but you definitely come here for the pizza. Never had a bad experience at Venezia's and I've been to the Chandler and Tempe locations as well.

I often come here for the pedicure. For $20 you get a massage and sugar scrub (most salons offer it as an add on). One time I cracked BOTH my large toenails and they put a nail glue, acrylic, then filed down and painted them. I was happy because my feet looked as if nothing had happened. That was an extra $5 or so.   The technicians aren't chatty so if you're looking for a pedicure/therapist this isn't the place for you.

Great neighborhood bagel joint. I've always had delicious bagels and cream cheese here. Got the lox bagel sandwich once and while it was a lot pricier than I expected it was amazing!! As always you get the little muffin with all sandwich orders.

Out of the local places this is the best, I've never eaten there so I always order over the phone. Get the pad Thai or pad sew ew!

Walked in for an eyebrow wax, $10 is pretty standard. The space looks clean, didn't have a chance to look at the color selection for nail services but would consider going there again if I'm in the area. Most places I go to I break out after a wax, did not experience that here.

I kind of love Yogis, the food is very consistent and I like the simplicity of the menu. I usually get the teriyaki and sushi/tempura combo and everything is delicious. I also really like the miso soup and it's a good deal.

I love the food here, it's very authentic. Be warned that this is not the kind of place where you'll get in and out fast. The wait is always kind of long but the food is fresh. I always get a cheese and a mixed pupusa.

I've been here twice, the first time was a while ago on a Saturday night. Service was TERRIBLE. When I ordered my second drink I never got it, 20 mins later we had to flag down the waitress to get our bills and that second drink was not even ready.  The second time I went here was happy hour on a weekday with my work friends. We got food, I had the fried mashed potatoes and they were great. Service was better and the drinks alright. Okay place to drink locally.

I only went here because I was right across the street at QT and the ratings were good. I had a gel manicure and it was great. She removed A LOT of cuticle, which made me mad because I had a gel manicure at another salon in Tempe two weeks ago and I thought my nails were fine (nope!). Dolly's was better priced with much better service than the place I've been going to. She also went out of her way to learn my name and was incredibly nice. I'm definitely going back.  Update: I went again a couple times after and had great experiences but the last time I had a gel manicure and one of my nails didn't cure right so it started to lift. I went to have it fixed the next day and that same day it lifted halfway up. I didn't want to go again and ended up finding a wonderful place close to my office.

This is my favorite place for nails because the color selection is great and everyone has a lot of attention for detail. I have gotten manicures, a gel manicure, pedicures, and brow waxes here before and I've never been less than satisfied with any of the services. For holidays they usually have a nail round or two of sample nail art you can get. I don't get acrylics but I've seen that they have a bunch of different tips and glitters to choose from.

I found this on Yelp and went because the reviews are pretty good. I got a regular polish French manicure and it was nice, I would have liked it if they spent more time on a hand massage. The polish selection is good and I like that they used Seche Vite topcoat because it's my favorite.   I asked for a specific style of French where the base was a dark polish and the tip was black, the nail tech didn't understand me and did something different for the first nail but when I told her again what I was looking for she wiped my nail and re-did it. She had a very pleasant attitude and excused herself for the misunderstanding. Overall a good experience and the place looks newly remodeled and very clean.

So mediocre. Tried the Pad Thai and it was completely unimpressive. Spring rolls were also mediocre.
