Very expensive for a bowl of soup just over $7.00. Also the very small potato chips for the Kettle bag is $1.99. Really!!! That is way to high for 4oz of chips and mostly air.

This has got to be the slowest fast food drive up. 10 mins in line. Ice cream Sunday was partially melted. Took forever to get just one fish fillet even after waiting forever in line.

We got there at a very busy time but there was no excuse for getting two of our plates to us real fast and or other place which we ask for twice and were told it was getting prepared was never given to us. We decided we didn't want it because it was a half an hour later and decided to leave. When we got our bill they had charged us twice for something we never even got. Good thing we always check our tab. They took the $23 off of the bill and as we were getting ready to go a waiter came up and gave us our food and we declined it. The manager came and gave us a free appetizer card and told us they compensated us on our check but in reality they just took off the food that we never received.

Try to call the membership hotline and was immediately put on hold via the computerized system. Finally just hung up after 15 mins and 3 extra phone calls attempts to that same number. Most likely nobody works at that number cause they have terrible customer service. To date: 8/06/2012. I have tried several times via phone calls/messages to get this resolved. I have also called the Gym and also the person who told me to email him Zeynep Watson has not resolved this either. I have finally sent in a complaint to BBB to see if they can get my membership cancelled.

I have hunted around for the best deal and found Discount tires are honest about their pricing and what is tacked onto it right up front. I don't have to guess what else needs to be included with my new tires. Even when it's extremely busy there is always someone happily ready to help you out. I have never been disappointed with the customer service in any of their stores.

I've gone there several times just for breakfast and have never been disappointed. I love the service. They are very friendly and thoughtful. I love the hash browns  and the grits. Seems like a old fashion combo. The food is always warm to hot when I get it. The coffee is always full and I don't have to hunt down the wait staff to get my coffee filled. My mom came down from Montana and she loved the wall decorations (she could relate) and the over all experience.

I have passed by this place several time just because I thought the name was strange. Well never again. I thought the portions were excellent. The waitress was fabulous and the atmosphere was relaxing. I would definitely bring my family here for breakfast from now on. Oh and the price advertised by the front door says no meal over ten dollars.

Was a very nice evening dining experience. I got the large feast and was absolutely satisfied. Just wish the lobster would have been bigger (I love lobster). Service was right on everything from the drinks to keeping up with items needed for our table.

Great food and never disappointed. I hadn't been here for a while so when I stopped by I was surprised the food wasn't extremely salty. It was hot so watch out. Don't and won't be able to gobble your food down. I ordered my favorite which was shrimp with lobster sauce which was awesome. They have great lunch specials but only on a few selected dishes. Mine was full price. Place is clean and airy. Only weird thing was that when there is nobody at the counter to order the wait staff stand at the counter and watch the customers eat.

Had a gift card so decided to use it here. They were running a special on some drink that had Carmel and they stated running out and cheaping on the Carmel. One guy sent his drink back because of that issue. My drink was great. The place was packed but the service was awesome.

This was the first time in a long time that I actually ordered the soup and sandwich.  I got a coke and the machine doused me with soda by spraying all over the place. Other people were having the same problem. Got my potato soup and it was cold.  The cheese on top wouldn't even melt.  My tuna sandwiches was tasteless.  The bread was toasted and the tuna had eggs in it.  There was no flavor to it. I could make this bad of a tuna sandwich at home. That's why I don't eat tuna sandwiches at home I'm not good at it.  When I come here I'll just stick to the salad bar where if I don't make it right it would be my own fault.

Been going here for years and I always have had excellent customer service especially from one person whose name is Kutty. He has been my sales person for multiple purchases and has always been helpful in describing everything I ask about and showing me several items that I might be interested in. At times when he has not been there the customer service has always still been very good even when I had walked in with sweatpants, hair messy they still treat me as if I was top dollar customer. I have been given a call when there are special events or special event purchases from there staff. Sometimes I even go in just to have Jewelry cleaned even though I never had bought it there they will still clean it.   Recently I went to a store at the Mills Mall called Jared Vault, thinking it was a discount outlet store but unfortunately the purchase for the same ring that I had found at Jareds was triple price and the Vault only discounted it half price so I would not recommend the outlet store to anyone and instead go to Jareds to get better quality in price.

This store "Jared Vault" is affiliated with Jareds and Kay jewelry and is an outlet store. When we went in to find a diamond ring the store clerk said the ring that we picked out was $2899 and they can discount it through the outlet store where Jareds could not. They discounted the ring down to $1899 and we thought we were getting a great deal so we purchase the ring. After doing some research on Jared's, I discovered this ring was actually $1699. I went down to Jareds to compare rings and pricing. The store clerk at Jareds noticed that my purchase was not as high quality diamonds as the one in the Jared Vault store. My purchase had more of a yellow tint to the diamonds and the price should have been only $1699.  Jareds Vault claims they are a discount store where actually they are not. They are ripping people off by saying they can discount jewelry but in actuality they are profiting on the same make and model of the original rings in Jared's.  This was the first and last time I will ever buy any jewelry at this store located in the Mills Mall.

Had the miso soup and caterpillar roll for lunch. The soup was large and very good but the sushi roll was not made properly and kept on falling apart when I tried picking it up with the chopsticks.  The wasabi was not very strong and ended up using the whole amount in my soy sauce. The sushi chef took longer to make my sushi because he was more interested in watching TV instead. There was only me and another couple have lunch. My sushi  cost almost $10 for one roll and my large soup was almost $8. The atmosphere was casual. There was a large wall aquarium with absolutely no fish in it. Strange? This place is too expensive for lunch dining.

I would say that the food here is nothing special. The prices are double over what you would pay for this meal. I got the chicken wings which were about $13 and a beer. Altogether the bill was $20. I noticed that all of the food on the menu were over $10 regardless of what it was. Pretty much simple barfood with a hefty price.

Came back to this famous place after years of not going and ordered the appetizer fish and chips. It was the very best fish and chips I have ever eaten anywhere. Just wish the portion size were just a bit more and the price was a bit less. But will definitely be going there again to have something different on the menu because if they can make fish and chips this great the rest of the meals must be fantastic. The beer and drinks were served in smaller than usual glasses put charges the same price as if it were 12 ounces or more

Great sushi. We always sit at the preparer bar location to watch as our sushi is made. Our server was excellent and talking to the sushi preparer was very interesting. We experimented with a few different dishes and each was delicious.

Last Saturday evening, me and a friend went here and sat at the bar. It took 10 minutes for the bartender to notice us and there was only three people at the bar. He finally came over to ask us what we wanted then he when back over to the other side and started talking to some girls and washing glasses. We order the beer sample which didn't require those types of glasses. After about another 15 mins (I was timing it) he kept talking to the girls by the wash area. We finally left and as we walked by he said "oh sorry"

After going there several times to see if this place has gotten any better since they first opened, I have eaten there several times and the food is really  good. Customer service has improved and the place seems very busy. The new opening week we really a bad experience but now I would recommend this place.

This place is a joke. Second time I've been in here and they have charged me for items placed on my plate. I was charged $2.50 for small dribble of onions $2.50 and for refried beans which I ate in four bites. They charged me for rice and green Chile.  By the time I got out of there with a ice tea drink I was charged over $20 for a very simple small meal. The waitress was running from one area to the other area and was extremely slow getting to our table. There was nobody attending the bar area and we were there for 30 minutes and never seen anybody in that area.

Been there a couple of evening and sat out on the patio area where the waitresses ignore you until you jump up and grab one even though she run ever table around yours. She wont even look at you when you wave at them. Had to go to the inside bar to order drinks instead and me snd my friend got sick drinking the overly sugary daiquiri and long island. Had to leave early after feeling sick but did finally wave down a waitress and get some chips.

Moved in with a friend and what a joke. First the laundry room on one side has no air conditioning and the machines are always broken and the place is filthy.  Talked to maintenance about it and said its on their list to fix but not high priority. Asked my roommate who has lived here four years and he told me he doesn't remember it ever working including several machines. Large dog poop is left directly in front of our door every morning and when management are told they say they can't do a thing about it. There is no dish washer or special amenities here but charge stupid high prices for just a one bedroom.  Maintenance does not fix anything correctly and the management don't care.  The whole office staff was let go last month. One for stealing rent money and another for covering it up.  People are breaking their lease just to leave. Since this all happen, the out of state management has given all section 8 renters till December to move out regardless of their rent agreement. The only good thing about the renters vacating is that the shared water bill is now lower on the our end.  The apartment is large for a one bedroom but there is a storage room that could be used as a washer/dryer area and the kitchen/bathroom cabinets need updating.  Repainting isn't a update, Really! The bathtub has been painted so many times that there are stains that will not come out. Crickets and bugs keep crawling through the front door where there are large gaps. This place is under new management 2015.

Went looking for cleaning products but didn't buy any because it was junk. Stuff that falls apart and one time use items. Also the prices were no different then a grocery stores.  They do have quick pick up items that are not bad if you don't want the congestion of a large grocery store place.

I'm giving the store only a one star because I decided to buy a couple of aquatic small fish toys. The lady said they were $14.50. So I bought two. Later I realized they were apiece. Currently I seem the same item being sold in another mall for half that price. I brought those items back. I refuse to pay double the price for anything. I thought it was a total ripoff. If a store who claims to support a cause decides to double the price should be ashamed for ripping people off.

Usually go there on a weekend but decided to go during the week. There was free admission do we stopped by. The place held a few people who just like us just wanted some entertainment on a weekday. We had a blast!  Sat up front and sang every song. The two singers were full of energy which got the crowd singing and laughing. Great place to be entertained and to chill on a hot day.

This place is pretty nice to visit for entertainment. The seats are high and the arm rest retract. There is plenty of leg room and low lighting so if you need to take a restroom break you can see the steps. But this is where this place goes wrong. Only one centralized restroom so if your movie is in the back corner there is quite a walk. The restroom needs better ventilation and constant upkeep during busy hours.

Every time I go there it seems to be about the same great atmosphere. Excellent service, cheerful wait staff, clean restrooms, tables and the selection in live music is awesome. I always recommend any of my friends to this place when we want to hang out, have a few drinks, eat or watch the bands. Only thing I would say is not that great is the parking. It's extremely tight and your car will get dinged.

I've only eaten there twice and both times the serve was horrible. There are only three people. One waitress, one bartender and I think one is the cook which no matter what you can't understand him. When we sat down at 6pm, it took 10 mins for them to get our drink order. Our appetizer came out pretty fast but it took another 1/2 for our food to come out. There was three people in the whole place. Now the tea I got was excellent, my food was ok tasting until I bit into spoiled chicken.  I spit it out and it smelt rancid. They wanted to make me a new dish but I refused. I about had it with this place. We waited another 1/2 an hour for our bill but never got it so we went to front to pay. All and all it took us 1-1/2 hour to finish and get out. Will not ever go back.

Can't say I'm too crazy about this place anymore. Haven't been here for a while and it seems the place has gone downhill. Grabbed a bunch of crab legs and most of them were empty inside and rubbery. They lack flavor and were small and watered down. I picked out a few of my favorite dishes but I really did come there for the crab legs. Was very disappointed in the price which has also gone up since I've been there. Will not be returning.

I go here for the cheap happy hour beers and the company. I usually sit at the bar. The seating has gotten better but when they put the backs on the chairs people would lean back and almost break them. The cushions fabric on the chairs make you sweat badly and the concrete bar table will burn your arms in the summer and they are in the shade. The food is good and cheap. The bar waitress are good but sometimes you get that "one" who won't pay attention to you at all. I think she is more concerned about popping out those fake boobs at everyone. The parking isn't that great.

Wasn't quite sure what was wrong with the service today. Went there for St. Patrick's Day and got in right away. They sent us is the betting/gaming section. The lights were incredibly bright there so we asked if they could be turned down like the rest of the restaurant. But they said they could not do it. I figured it was because of the betting  going on. We ordered wings and they were pretty good but for some reason when we ordered steamed vegetables we ended up with two baggies full of steamed vegetables stuffed into a small jar. Definitely not a way to serve steamed vegetables. It was borderline disgusting.

First time here for a meet up group and tried to order a beer in the inside bar. The bartender talked and talk and talked. The girls were doing their job but he just wanted to talk. After a half hour I walked out. People were complaining about the fact he gave a beer away but charged someone in our group for it.  Seems the wait staff are really confused.

Had the bacon burger and it was huge and  very good. The fries were good to with the cheese on them. The waitress was very prompt. This burger seemed to tower above all else. Another person next to us ordered a burger and he had to smash it down to try to get it in his mouth. There burgers are very, very good. Just the presentation scares you.

Nice theater with spacious seating.  Our movie was for 7:10 but after almost 1/2 hour of previews we were wondering if our movie would ever start. One really BIG issue I had was how filthy the toilets were. There was poop stains on the seat, spilled pop in one stall and gross slime inside the toilet. Now really, to have that much slime means that restroom had not been cleaned properly for at least a week or two.  I figure if they are not sanitary with their restrooms, I wonder what they are not cleaning in the concessions.

Can't say I will ever go back for breakfast.  Ordered a simple two eggs over easy, hashbrown and sausage. The toast had so much margarine on it I actually had to scrap it off. The hashbrown looked nice and crispy until I uncovered the over cooked crispy and over fried underneath. I couldn't even eat the hashbrown. The "small" sized over easy eggs were over cooked and had very little yolk. I went to use the bathroom and one of the two toilets were full of toilet paper and shit.  There was even a employee in there that didn't do anything about it. When we went to pay, the girl at the counter asked how our meal was and I mentioned the over cooked hashbrown.  She just said sorry and that was that.

Always go through the drive up. Usually takes the person a while to either understand me or me understand them. Otherwise ordering is pretty simple. When asked if I want sauce I just stop saying yes over the intercom cause I never get it anyway. The food is pretty basic but once in a while they have some new item that is pretty good. They are fast and havent had to many mishaps.

Really like the live bands they have. Parking is a pain but worth going in because the drink specials and the waitress are awesome. The dance floor is the size of a quarter it seems. Food is typical bar food but good. There are some really good events they come up with throughout the year.

This is definately a huge store with such large sections of just about everything you need for outdoors. The awesome displays of animals make you want to hunting but they do need some dusting off. Since the store is super busy we did have trouble finding some to ask questions. I noticed some classes going on and a cool shooting range.

Came in with my friend around 3 and had no one greeting us to get a table. I had to beg someone to get my disabled friend a seat.  Waitress was slow getting to our table and forgot to get my friend a second glass of wine. She finally had to go to the bar to ask for another glass and there was probably only five people in the whole place.  The salad that was $8 was a handful of salad which wasn't worth the money.

We decided to eat here only because all the places at the casino had a two hour wait. We got seated quickly and our waitress took our order and mentioned that she will very much keep our water filled. Never seem her again and had to beg for water. Got our corn bread and soup which was really good but waited 45 mins for our salads. The couple next to us got their meal in 15 mins.  Our Salads were drenched in salad dressing and tasted horrible. We ate only a 1/4 of our meal because we were very hungry otherwise we would have sent them back and we didn't want to wait another 45 mins. For $10 salad it sure was gross. The wait staff was running around like they were short staffed. There was probably only less the twenty people. Very unorganized mess watching them hussle about with oversized heavy dishes with small food items on each.  It took two people to carry entries out for a table of two.

For a book store this is pretty well put together with the customer in mind. When you first walk in the smell of books and Starbucks coffee fill your nose. Makes you want to stay forever to relax. In front are the specials and bargains. Each isle is categorized with large signs so it is easy to find what you want. The staff is helpful and friendly. There is a central location just for them so if you have a question they are easy to find. I thought Starbucks was a cleaver add to a bookstore.

I came to this veterinarian hospital in 2015 with my Sheltie Izzy. In August of last year my dog was having symptoms were he looked lethargic and was not drinking any water or eating. I brought him in and I mentioned something about Ticks and they gave him medicine for that and also hydrated him. He seem to have gotten better and was eating and running around again. By November of that same year he started having the same issues so I brought him back and they hydrated him again but this time they said it might be something different. I got a blood test done to see if it was anything to do with ticks and it wasn't. So they gave him some different medication and it wasn't working for him he look like he had a terrible headache and was banging his head against the wall and falling over.  I called them back and asked the receptionist to have the doctor call me to see if I should come in again and I received no call back from the Doctor who treated him. By that afternoon he was so sick that I decided to bring him up to a different doctor because I got no call back from this doctor. I am admitted him to the clinic and by that evening he was dead.  The reason I didn't take my dog back to this doctor was because of the no follow-up call from them and when I mention to them that I couldn't afford to pay for a lot of veterinarian bills it seem like they ignored me completely. I had this dog for 12 years and he was my best friend.

Love this place for the food and the price. It is good for beginners to experience sushi for the first time. I go during the hours that the huge crowds don't gather but sometimes I have to wait longer for the good sushi to come onto the conveyor belt. Coming in as a single person I usually get seated within 10mins with a crowd. The selection is pretty good and when your done there is a good stack of dished in front of you without the high price. I am not scared to keep grabbing more plates.

First time here and ordered wings. I usually don't like mine hot (spicy) but when I got them they were cold. Warm in the middle and cold tips. The flavor was good and I could eat them fast but having parts of it half frozen was a big turn off. The waitress was pretty fast at taking our order and delivering our drinks.

Probably the worst place to get a drink because the service is so awful. This place had gone down hill since I have been going. Our waitress and that evening was so caught up in serving another table all night that she forgot us after three drinks. I finally complained to the bartenders that we couldn't locate her and wanted another glass of wine. She seen what I did and came over but the damage was already done.  She didn't come back to our table for another half and hour and I cleared the table of all our glasses and left them at the bar. She seen me do this but we just got our tab and left.  Bad service, water down drinks and they short change if you pay in cash. Bathrooms toilets have orange scum in them which means they haven't been scrubbed or cleaned for over a two weeks. I should know because I do personal house cleaning and some of my customers are every other week.

Since I'm trying to eat healthy without the high cost of vegetable so this place is the place. The labels are a bit confusing and the market really smells like fish but there are a lot of live, fresh and frozen fish. Everytime I'm there I find items that are great to cook with. There is really nobody to ask questions so your on your own. The place is clean and usually not really crowded.

Like this place for the friendly people who work there. Almost make you feel like family. Had two services there so far. A oil change and replaced my battery. Each time I got in quickly. The draw backs are, they don't always answer the phones right away. Have to call back to get them to answer. Second: the battery change wasn't completed properly. the mechanic didn't attach my air intake and I had to return to the store. Other than that, I feel confident enough to return

I haven't gone to BWW for a long time but will start going again if I want the buffalo wings. They were very good. The wait staff filled our drinks and it didn't really matter if it was our usual waiter. If one of the waiters noticed our drinks getting low they would fill them. The atmosphere was pretty decent.

Had my first massage after holding out for over 10 years. Had gone to the college training massages twice and thought they were ok but not a good experience. I still rate my massage on the very first one I had which was outstanding. Nothing better then relaxing so much you almost fall asleep. With this massage, it was basic. I would have to rate it with the college experience because I just don't really know what needed to be done. I figure I would go with the medium pressure and really should have gone with the deep tissue. It was nice and relaxing but not enough.  The girl was very informative and suggested what I should have gotten in the first place. I signed up for the monthly services which included either the massage or the facial which if I didn't use it I don't lose it but it carries over to the next month. The whole experience surely made me feel important and comfortable.

First time here and really didn't know what to expect. When the happy hour food came out the portion was very small but outstanding flavor and sauce. Dipping the bread in the sauce was so mouth watering. I just couldn't get enough. I had the rabbit which was very tender and the shrimp.

I wouldn't mind coming to this location to eat and watch TV because the food and the menu and the wings all seem like they have a great selection. Place is very spacious and open and there are plenty of servers to help out when you need it. The only reason I would not continue coming to this place is because they blast the music so loud but you cannot hear anybody three feet away from you. Even the waiters have issues trying to get your order and have to yell back at you over the loud music. Went there last night to have wings at 130 in the morning and sure enough the music was so loud that we thought if we ever want to have wings again to bring our ear plugs with us.

First time there and sat at the bar. At first we were over whelmed by the customer service (two waitress helping us out) then after awhile there was absolutely no one we could get to order a second drink. We waited about 20 mins just to get our bill and to leave after waving down someone. The place was busy and I had ordered a sample drink but after getting no service we decided to leave.

First time there and it was awesome. Brought my dog and he was taken care by the wait staff right away with a bowl of water. The place had a great relaxed feeling and friendliness. The mountain views help make that feel too. The food was quick and very good. Portion size was great. The drinks were filled constantly. Only issue was the parking.

First of all, entering the place wasn't at all the feeling of cozy, heartwarming dining experience. More like running cattle through a chute waiting for a feeding.  We were walked over to a table which hadn't been cleaned yet. Of all the tables that were empty she set us up with one that had two wet wash clothes and a broom and dust pan prompt against our seats. I said the seating wasn't acceptable but she said it would be gone after we got our food.  It wasn't. We got our ice tea after a while and when asked to have it refilled the waitress rolled her eyes and stumbled around like a toddler who just didn't want to do this any more.  The food was acceptable but after watching the staff refill the food trays and throw old food that had fallen out back into the new trays, I came to the conclusion everybody was doing the same. I seen small kids by themselves doing the same thing. Food wasn't very hot. I seen no steam rising when the staff changed trays. Most of the utensils were sticky.  The floors were really dirty and I noticed everything on our table was sticky including the back of the seats.

Everytime I go there the place is impressing me more and more. Went there in the early afternoon to meet friends. The bartender was so friendly and suggested a drink for my friend. It was awesome.  The atmosphere is relaxing and even when I've gone there during the evening it's still pretty fun. Great bands playing. Good dance floor space and great crowds.

Very family friendly. Food was really good and the atmosphere was pretty relaxing. The music playing nice and low so we could talk without yelling. The waitress was very prompt and friendly.

Started going there since now I live out of town and it's on my way to work. The gas for my car is cheaper. I like that it comes out so fast that you don't have to waste your time waiting forever to pump. The only draw back is that the fumes will make you pass out. There is no cup at the end of the nozzles so you will smell the strong ordor. I haven't tried the convenience store yet so can't comment on that.

Just stopped by for a quick bite to eat. Seen the adult smoothies variety and just had to have one. I was expecting a small cup size but it was actually larger and really good. Had the wings and was surprised how awesome they tasted.

I absolutely love their chips and salsa which they offer to you free. The customer service here is excellent and have always had prompt service and the meals have come to you fast. Beers and happy hour is an excellent time to go and just relax. The only thing I thought was annoying was the floor fans that are along the bar.

Just happen to be in the area so decided since I have been to the one in Chandler it should be good. I was very surprised. First the place looked so much cleaner and more professional. The cooks were dressed all in uniforms. The amount of sushi rotating were all my favorite. I ended up eating way more then I usually can. Exceptionally clean place and well organized team. Was seated quickly and water, wasabi was given to me right away.

First time here and was very impressed.  The bartender was very knowledgeable and friendly.  I mentioned my phone was going dead and he gave me a cord to plug in where there was a station for it.  I ordered a skinny Margareta which he didn't make before and was amazingly good.  The hummus nachos were extremely tasty.  We never really knew what this place was all about but after reading the menu we are going back for the smores and since its a dog friendly place we are bringing him to.  Its now our favorite bar and eatery.

I found this place out by a group I belong to. I decided to go ahead instead. I wasn't disappointed. The cost is a bit high. $20 for just me. First they take you into a theatre to watch in 3-D the flight of the monarch butterflies then you go into a small room with large windows showing cocoon butterflies coming out of them. There is such wild metallic gold and silver ones but they were not hatching. Just wish the room was bigger because after the theatre everyone is crabbed into this small room. You have a choice of entering the butterfly exhibit or view the hatching. The minute you go into the live butterfly exhibit they land on you. There is so many different species to take pictures of them.  The area gets really humid and uncomfortable so you leave to the air conditioned cafe or to the ant, bee, aquarium  and stingrays. Amazing large aquariums with someone to tell you about the exhibit. I thought this place was very educational and relaxing even with the large crowd.

Oh my goodness I love this place if I lived closer I probably would be there all the time.  Sat outside bar area at night with the full moon on us and the fireplace going it was very pleasant experience and the Brewery beer samples were amazing.  I ordered the beer cheese soup and was amazed by how good it taste. Last time I ate cheese soup was in North Dakota and always wanted to find some here in Arizona. I would definitely go back to have my choice of brew beer and beer cheese soup. Our bartender was very helpful in helping us out with picking our favorite beer samples and suggesting food.

First off the sign is very small. Maybe because of the name but the place is pretty big inside and clean.  Got greeted immediately and was attended to for drinks and ordering. Got the free miso soup offer from yelp. Small bowl but really good. Ordered off the lunch special and got the tempura box and was completely full. Will need to go back for just the sushi to see if I can give more stars. Received a free California sushi card from our waiter which was nice.  Ordered a beer which I was a bit expensive for $5 a bottle.

I like the place when I first walked in. Seems like a very delightful casual atmosphere with large paper as place mats and dining trays. There were two wait staff which seemed to accompanying each table. Since this place is new I figure they were training but each added to the conversation of delights on the small menu. The prices were on the chalk board above us. The meals only come as 1 pound each and that is plenty. You can order mild to very hot spice for all your boiled meals. I will be going back but not ordering as much since I waddled out of there completely full and satisfied.

This had to be the worst experience ever for a restaurant I have gone to. First of all I went with a group of nine people for brunch. The waiter Alexander was extremely slow and didn't seem like he knew what he was doing. He took our orders and kept forgetting to bring things to us when our order came. Three of us refused their food because it was cold or the wrong order. Mine tasted good but it was cold even though it was on a second plate that was hot. Most likely to keep it warm. My  coffee was cold and I never was served water. One lady who was a vegetarian got meat on her omelette. Another lady had just sent her order back because it was the wrong order. Another lady said her food was so cold that she refused to eat it. The bill for certain ones came up incorrect. And when I gave him my credit card to pay for my bill and he came back with it he didn't know whose credit card was whose and there was only one. When I went to the restroom it was so disgusting and had never been cleaned from the night before. There was pubic hair and toilet paper remains that were sitting all over the back of the toilet. The waiter constanly made excuses about him serving 6 tables but the place was basically empty. I would not ever recommend anybody eating at this establishment simple because of the poor service, the filthy toilets and have a scatterbrain way of cooking the food. Came back again just to see what everyone was saying about the best time to go was happy hour. Went on a Wednesday and sat at the bar. I ordered drinks which were pretty good and strong. Also ordered a appetizer which ended up getting mixed up and was sent to another table. A hour later I finally got my appetizer. He comped me 10% for the wait. This place just can't get their act together.
