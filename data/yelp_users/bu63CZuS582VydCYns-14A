I have stayed here many times over the past 8 years while on business trips. It is convenient to my home office location. Service has always been good and the rooms comfortable. It is a good business hotel property. Food has been average to good. It is an indoor atrium type of hotel where all room doors face inward towards the atrium and is 11 floors high.

Wanting to do some sightseeing while in Pittsburgh on a business trip I had some free time to visit both inclines.   I parked my car in their parking lot and paid $2 for one hour. That's plenty of time to go up and down and go thru the little museum at the top. I then walked over to the ticket office and bought a RT for $5. Their car is different than the Monongahela which is a stacked 3 level car where the best view is on the lowest level. The Duquesne car is a flat one level car where every seat has a good view. The view here is of the point where the two rivers meet to form the Ohio. I personally think think this is a little bit better view but that's my opinion. You can also see downtown from here.   When you get to the top they have a small museum that is free to walk around along with a nice viewing platform outside attached to the building. Also for .50 cents you can take a self guided tour underneath the building that shows the inner workings of the incline. I highly recommend doing this. It will take you about 5-10 minutes to look around even though you can stay longer. It is very interesting. At the top there are about 3-4 restaurants very near the top building. From what I could tell they were more high end and expensive restaurants than at the top of the Monongahela had. They all had great views looking out over the rivers.   I prefer this inclines ride and view but like what is on top of the other incline better. Also Duquesne is more expensive. If you can do both.

This is a difficult review to write.  The exterior of this building is impressive. The interior auditorium is very nice. Lincoln's Gettysburg Address above the stage is inspiring. I can see why this auditorium is so popular with graduation ceremonies. So why do I give a 2?  The museum part of the attraction is disappointing. For $10 for an adult you get to go around the the exterior of the auditorium while still inside the building and look at these display cases that have rather routine military artifacts in them. I love military history and have seen far better exhibits. I was bored with my tour. This place needs a curator to better display what they have and more importantly add to it.   At present I cannot recommend you to pay $10 to view what they have and while the auditorium is nice to walk into its not worth the admission fee by itself.  I wish the museum was far better.

While I am not a member nor do I live in Arizona on occasion when in Arizona I will come here to shoot during their Tuesday steel matches. It's a lot of fun and for only $12 as a non member entry fee a real bargain. This seems to be a good range with a lot to offer.  I recommend coming here!!

I purchased a one night stay here on Hotwire which listed this place as a 2 1/2 star property. I needed a hotel close to the airport for an early flight the next morning and was traveling by myself. Thank  goodness I was by myself.  This place was dumpy. Not necessarily the lobby or the grounds but my room smelled of cigarette smoke, had a hair in the sink and was basically low rent. Now in all fairness I got a really good deal on Hotwire and the room did provide me a bed and shower and an a/c that worked well. However this is not a 2 1/2 star property. It is more like a 1 star property. Hotwire did this to me about a month before with severely mislabeling a property and I may stop using them or only go with 3 star and above.  Only stay here if you can get a real low rate ( less than $50). I would not want to return.

I had some free time upon arriving in Pittsburgh and wanted to do some sightseeing. I picked the Monangahela Incline first. Parking at Station Square was easy. I then walked into Station Square and the little indoor shopping center area. It didn't seem like there was much to see or do there. I went to the bottom of the incline and got in the car and rode it to the top. My advice is to sit as low in the car as possible to get the best view. The view of this incline is the Monangahela River and downtown Pittsburgh. When I got to the top, I purchased a round trip,ticket for $3.50. At the top there is a nice viewing platform about 25 yards away from the top building. About 50 yards from the viewing platform is an area of shops, restaurants and bars including a popular ice cream stand. This makes for a great diversion of killing some time while up here.  I recommend when coming up here to plan your trip to eat lunch or dinner at one of the restaurants here. The incline runs late at night and after dinner and/or drinks the view at night would be very nice. If you can't do a meal then get some ice cream like I did and enjoy.  I could have walked over to the Duquesne and rode that but round trip it would have been 2 miles and I didn't bring the right shoes and it was a little warm that day.  I prefer riding the Duquesne slightly more due to its car construction which allows a great view from all of its seats. Also the small museum at the top of the Duquesne is neat too. However I prefer the dining, shopping and drink options at the top of the Monongahela better. My recommendation is to do both.   If you come to Pittsburgh this is a must do. It's interesting to see that residents use this as a form of transportation.

I found this place on Yelp after looking at its high reviews and went for dinner last week. It's located in a sort of run down strip,shopping center. After walking in I noticed it is a counter service only restaurant that centers on seafood and BBQ but the menu has more seafood items than BBQ. Because of that I decided on fried fish and ordered the whiting which came with one side and I chose fried okra. I then decided to also try their baked beans as another side that I paid extra for.   The food arrived about 15 minutes later. The whiting was excellent! The flavor along with being fried properly allowed me to really enjoy that fish (4.5). The fried okra was good and I rated them at (3.5). The beans were ok and I gave them a 3.   The owner was taking orders at the cashier stand and was very friendly. This is a place you come to that is laid back and casual for a good meal. While there I got the impression it is a popular neighborhood spot which is good. I wish I could have tried some of their Q but the whiting really was excellent!

I was brought here while on a business trip by a coworker who highly recommended this place for lunch. I ordered the wood fired chicken entree along with an order of pita chips as an appetizer.   The chips were good. The large crunchy/chewy chips were good and I enjoyed them (3.5). The chicken dish arrived about 15 minutes after ordering. It was a large portion of food with diced tomatoes on top and wilted spinach and garlic mashed potatoes beneath the chicken and was very good (4). It was a full meal and I wouldn't hesitate to order it again.   Table service was good (3.5). Parking was available for no cost in the adjacent parking garage.

This is a high end Holiday Inn near the airport. It is a very nice property that includes a restaurant and a bar. They offer a free shuttle to the airport twice an hour. Unfortunately there aren't any other restaurants or shops within walking distance but their shuttle can take you to places nearby.  If you are staying in Phoenix or just want to be near the airport, I highly recommend.

Chips and salsa were a 2. Runniest salsa I have ever had. Soupy. My shrimp enchiladas were ok. This is a bar restaurant where the mexican food is barely average. Service was good.

They give good quality service. I was pleased with my shine. Cost for shoes is $5 plus tip. It represents good value.

Set in an old Spanish church this cool restaurant was a pleasure to visit earlier this week. My company had a dinner for my department here.   Taco's are the dominant menu item but there are also burritos and salads offered here among other items. I ordered 3 different taco's along with a side of borracho beans. We also had chips and salsa. I thought this was a weak part of the meal. Plenty of chips but the salsa servings were small. However I gave them a 3. The taco's arrived in a timely manner and were very good. I wish I could remember their names but one had duck meat, another was chicken and the third had pull pork as the meat. These high end taco's were very good (4).  I really like the interior decor of this place. Being in an old church gives it such a nice ambience with the stained glass windows and original furniture.  This is a restaurant that I would be happy to return.

I had dinner there too night with two local friends. I ordered the grilled chicken plate that came with Mac n cheese and slaw. The chicken breast had bbq sauce on it. I don't think I have ever had Mac n cheese as dry as that. It was horrible. The chicken was rubbery. The slaw ok,. My first mistake was not sending it back but my friends had recommended this restaurant and I didn't want embarrass them. My second mistake was coming to eat here.....
