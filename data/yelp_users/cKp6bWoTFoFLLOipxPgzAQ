They were a 5 star until they closed and didn't notify me.  My mail is now in the stratosphere because the telephone number is disconnected and the other Box N Mail on Power is not affiliated so no idea what happened to these people.  If anyone intercepts my mail please forward I'd appreciate it:(

I've been going here for about 5 years and I have had some really nice cuts over that time.  The place is clean and the workers here are really nice and listen to what you want.  They also keep records of  how they have cut your hair in the past so you don't have to remember exactly which number of cut you like.  I also think the prices are very good considering how well they cut my hair, it's definitely not just some super cuts place where your hair grows out funky in a couple of weeks.  The only negative in my mind is that I had some great people who worked here over the years who went on to another Sport Clips since they have quite a few in Phoenix.  Other than that I'm a going to continue to be a regular here because it's reasonable, fast, and I like the atmosphere.

I've been working with Forrest Anderson for over 5 years.  They impressed me first when I had gone through three different companies to diagnose a problem of why the air was not flowing and cooling a space I was renting.  They came out and said it was nothing to do with the AC units but with the leaky ducting. No one else even considered that.  They fixed the problem immediately and it was reasonable.  Since then I think I've used them a dozen times at different commercial locations and every time I get the same great service.  As far as price goes I usually don't compare anymore because I really do trust them, but if I have any questions about costs they are always open to saving me money by doing things a little different.  You will not go wrong by trying them out.  Branden is the person I deal with but the staff are equally nice also.

I had no idea about this place but was invited from a local that lived nearby.  When we first arrived I thought "oh no valet parking" because there was no regular parking. Yes I'm cheap I hate to pay before I've even gotten in the front door. The good news is they don't charge you when there are no regular spaces so I was ok.  We sat inside and I really liked the atmosphere from the get go.  Very upbeat and the place was pretty packed for a weeknight.  The menu looked good with many selections.  My friend go the ribs and I had the aji tacos and the other woman with us had the veggie tacos.  My plate normally comes with either black beans or fermented veggies.  I kind of could not decide so I had them give me both of them.  I liked the presentation of everything, The tortillas are really good and the only problem is they give one plate for two hungry people.  We had to ask for a couple more plates they were so good.  Everything tasted great and I thought the wait person was super nice and friendly.  There was a cute little baby at the table behind us that made everyone smile.  It is a little loud but not too bad.  It is definitely a good date spot. Overall a fun time

Great concept who would have ever thought that a restaurant that makes a 100 different types of British Pies could be successful.  But here you are with this place that blows away anything you would find in Britain that's for sure.  This place has a very eclectic atmosphere that's about the only was to describe it.  IT's got this very long bar area that goes along two rooms and the center of the bar area is actually the kitchen where there a handful of people making these pies all into the night.  I think I was there close to 12pm once and they were still making and baking these pies.  It's actually fun to watch.  The place is dark and loud so if that's not your thing than you might not be a fan but I love it.  All the pies I've had are really good and they do make a least 2 vegan options but they do run out sometimes so just be prepared.  There are also a very large amount of vegetarian pies with fake chicken and meats.  I had an Indian Vindaloo one that was really good and had a nice spicy kick.  All of the pies will come with a side of sauce for dipping and it really ads flavor to every bite.  The service here is top notch considering all the people and commotion of people making pies around them.  The people who come here are all pretty social especially in the bar area.  I've had people buy me drinks here because they are being friendly. Speaking of drinks they have a great beer and wine menu and it's reasonably priced.  Overall this is a place is a must try if you are in the area.

I love Blue Adobe Grille  when I'm in the Mesa area.  Yes the outside is pretty scary looking with real estate for sale signs everywhere and most things closed in the vicinity. Once you get into the place however it's nice and relaxing.  The chips and salsa they serve are very fresh, and they also had a couple of good micro brews on tap which is better than at most Mexican places.  The people behind the bar area are super nice and don't rush you.  I'm one of those people who order things differently than what they offer on the menu, and this place does a great job of accommodating me. One of my favorites is their veggie enchilada, but what I have them do is stack them on blue corn and have them come with the spicy red sauce.  I also get their side spinach salad which is a small extra fee.  The dish also comes with whole beens and rice.  All I can say is the flavors of spices they use make the dish really good.  I know there are as good places if you go to Santa Fe, NM, but as far as in AZ and In CA this place is tops.

I'm giving this place 5 stars on the quality of the sushi,  I came here for lunch when on business and saw all the good ratings here so decided to give it a try.  First off is don't come on Monday for lunch they are closed.  Second, be prepared to wait a bit for your order and items to come.  I'm ok with that to a point  because I think they really spend the time to prepare everything so it comes out nice.  But the woman working there seems not  to know many answers to the questions I had. She really could not answer which fish are in which selection.  She kept leaving and coming back to give me answers but between that and handling all the other tables it got to be a long wait to get everything.  So on to my sushi order. When I first got my order I was a little surprised of the selection I got, it was mostly different types of tuna.  I had red tuna, white tuna, albacore (a tuna), yellowtail, spicy tuna rolls, and 1 salmon sushi and a california fake crab like sushi, and a shrimp sushi (Ebi).  All the fish tasted really good though, the white tuna melted in my mouth. The spicy tuna is made a little different than at most places.  They chop it in pieces and and kind of float it over rice rolls. Very good but would have liked a little more spice. The sushi chef was very nice but seemed a little serious at the same time.  He would keep asking if everything was ok, and I just kept saying everything was fine as I tried to sneak in a picture of my dish. I don't know why but somehow It felt like I was committing an illegal act..  Anyway, 5 stars for the great food and 4 stars for the the little things that I think that could improve.

My favorite location is not here but in Tempe, but it seems that I'm always closer to this location so I come here.  This place takes the whole Idea of a British Pie to whole new level. It's unbelievable to me how many different varieties of pies they make here.  If you look at the vegetarian menu alone you will find something like 15-20 different varieties from tikka masala to Mexican, veggie pesto, to even ground beef.  They always also have 2 vegan options which are quite good, the last one was with corn and veggies with a tomato red sauce side.  They also make really healthy salads to go with your pie which are reasonably priced.  There are two huge bar areas to eat at and it's a pretty friendly atmosphere.  The people who work here are very nice and very informative on all the options for beer and wine.  The options of beers on tap are very extensive.  The night I went they had a specialty dark beer that was something like 12% and they told me they were the only restaurant in the world to offer it.  Wished I remembered the name but it was definitely a sipper and lasted the whole meal and beyond.  The only other reason why I like the other location better is you can't really watch them make the pies here.  Part of the fun is watching the crew making these things way into the night.  It just ads to the ambiance but even without that this place is pretty darn fun and it sure never gets tiring to keep coming back.

Been working near here in Peoria and found this place thanks to Yelp.  The first time I came I ordered the Coconut soup Tom Kha with  veggies and tofu Thai spicy and it came out in one of those Thai metal servers with a  burner below.  Wow this stuff was so good and tasty, I could barely finish it because it was a lot of food for one, but I loved it.  I could really taste the fresh ingredients in the dish, and it was nice and spicy the way I like it.  Since then I've gotten this dish many times and love it every time. I just went again last week and thought I better broaden my horizons so I got the Panang curry and asked to have it with veggies with tofu because I gather they don't normally serve this with veggies.  Anyway they did a great job of making it the way I wanted and it was very good.  The sauce looked a little different (more brown) than what I'm used to from Panang but it tasted really good, and again they spice it appropriately for what I wanted.  It came with rice and I also asked for their tray of spices which I recommend to compliment your dish. I thought the quantity was very large and I actually had leftovers but because of travel I had could not take anything to go.  As others have said they don't have lunch specials but the prices are within reason considering the quality and quantity of food.  Also the people who own the place are very friendly and I was once able to talk with one of them about their restaurant and I was impressed how much they put into getting quality ingredients which I think is the big problem with most Thai restaurants.  Overall I'm envious that I can't get this kind quality in Cali where I live but will keep coming back when I'm in the area.

This place is absolutely awesome.  I can't believe I have waited this long to make a review.  I am super lucky as I own a building down the street that I have to manage on a regular basis.  I always am stopping by here to get breakfast, lunch, a drink in between meals.  I've had a lot on the menu but some of the highlights are the tamale pie, the raw tacos are delish, the kale and cobb salads are great.  The drink menu is also plentiful, some of my favorites are the green abundance drink and the green coffee drink with berries.  The breakfast burritos are also filling and really fresh.  The prices are more expensive than other places but when you look at the quality of the food and care that goes into making their dishes it's totally worth it.  The only thing I would knock them on ( and I won't because the food is 6 stars) is the time it takes to get your order.  I've also been given other people's orders by mistake.  They are always nice about it but as they have become more popular over the years they seem to have a hard time keeping up.  Oh and lastly the deserts are really good and reasonably priced considering they are raw and generous portions.  I take them to go and they go a long way to satisfy a sweet tooth cravings you may have.  In my case I don't normally have deserts but I don't miss having one here.  They are fantastic.  I am super happy to support this place and hope they keep doing well as there is no substitute out there.

Normally I go to another Sushi place off of Gilbert but I saw this had such good reviews and I was nearby I thought I would try it out.  Overall I thought it was nice.  First off I will say that I wasn't that into the decor of the place.  It just didn't feel Japanese to me with the T shirts, TV, and Budweiser sign. Nonetheless the people who work here make up for that quickly with great service.  The menu was a little strange to read because it's not really a lunch menu, and it's a little hard to read.  I had read about the spicy sashimi salad on here so I asked about it and sure enough you could order it but it's not easy to find on the menu.  Anyway I ordered the Green tea which was really good and I highly recommend it.  It's very much like what you get in Japan.  The miso soup which is complementary is also really good even with the tiny amount of tofu, it just tasted very flavorful.  The salad itself was very good and filling and the sushi chef was nice to ask if I like scallops which I do and so he included that in the dish.  What was unique about the salad was the fish are coated in a spicy sauce that has no mayo in it (thanks) and it's quite spicy (thanks).  There wasn't a lot of greens but that was made up with a lot of fish on top.  It was probably the largest amount of fish I've had ever had on a sushi salad.  Some of the fish was better than others but it all tasted good.  One minor complaint was the fish was quite cold like it had been refrigerated and I thought the fish would have tasted better more room temp. I also got rice and I thought it was a little dry for my taste, but otherwise a great place to try and very reasonably priced for the quality here. Note this place sits in a kind of lonely shopping center with many vacancies so typical of AZ so no problem with the parking or getting a seat if you just show up:)

I've hired ABC for many projects I've needed for my properties in Arizona and he has not only been fair in his fees but I feel I can trust him to take care of my needs.  He always calls me to keep me informed even when I don't live in the area.  I just can't understand the people who gave him 1 star reviews as he has always been very responsive to my calls and communicated to me what he was doing.  I guess I'm lucky  that I've not had even close to the experience of Yanira, DJ, or Mikd. Recommend Highly!!!

This is regards to a commercial property I own in Peoria even though I live in California. I will give him an extra star for at least going out to my property and let me know he had an estimate.  After that he was not to be heard from again.  I called him to let me know what his estimate would be.  Called him again and gave him both my number and email to please email me an estimate.  Both times he decided he didn't want to follow up.  Not saying he might not do good work but I felt this guy let me down. Hope others have better luck.  UPDATE: I tried to call him again after he said I never worked with him but he again goes to voicemail and at this point I have found another landscaper that seems to be more reliable.
