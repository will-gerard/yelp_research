This past Saturday I had dinner in the Meat Packing District in Manhattan!  Oh no I am mistaken - actually I was right here in Phoenix at a fantastic little place called St. Francis.  Forgive my confusion, but I as I sat in this architectural joy with exposed brick, glass, inside out side bar, and the much talked about pulley suspended loft, I could not help to think i must not be in Phoenix.   Turns out I was and make no mistake this place is must more than just a pretty face.  Although not a very large menu - several items called to me from the page - so we let the server do the driving for us.  The goat cheese app was a perfect beginning, and as we were about 3 crostinis short on the cheese to bread balance, our server was quick to bring a few more, so that precious cheese would not go to waste.   My wife had the Seafood soup which was absolutley a joy.  Even good restaurants these days fall short of truly inspired flavor and this dish loaded with fresh seafood in a delicate yet savory broth was just amazing.  It had a personality all its own familiar yet a little exciting at the same time.  For me it was the Pork chop with the finest polenta I have every had.  If there is a filet mignon of pork chops this was it.  Since my wife is having a baby any minute now I had a glass of Tempronillo which I thought was nice option on a wine by the glass list.  We finished off with a simple but perfectly done apple-crisp ala mode.  After our meal we sat back with the quite satisfaction and grin of the chesire cat.   Nothing needed to be said we were in culinary paradise.    If that is not enough - the real magic of this place is the synergy of it all.  The food is amazing, the room has snap, but it all comes together with a diverse crowd unassuming yet hip (I hate that word).  A lovely group of four older people, next to my wife and I, sharing the energy with a young couple certainly on their first date and 4 ladies out for the evening.  Yes we all know Phoenix is growing and getting better every day, but this place is forcing its hand.  The city was alive and vibrant and best of all real , in this little masterpiece.    This is the kind of place I want to be a regular at - not because I want to be known there, but because I want to get to know it better.

Two things I am not...your typical Sam Fox food disciple and the type of person who would seek out healthy food.  So True food Kitchen,  is not the the type of face I would inhereantly rave about.  However, I am open minded and I do love a great product and service, so True truly nails it.  It is well documented that the food is great, match that with attentive, crisp, knowledgible service and hip yet comfortable dining room and this place rocks.  After a couple of visits it is now definately on my regular rotation.

The Search for a Tasty Consistent Breakfast place in Scottsdale...is over.  Good food, Nice people.  First of all in the service void of Old Town Scottsdale you can tell that the people at this place really care.  I have now become a bit of a regular there, but thats because the staff seemed to actually appreciate I was spending my precious few pesos with them instead of someone down the block.  So, I kept bringing my pesos their way.   I love the fact I always get a giant Ice Tea to go to keep me hydrated through-out my day.  The food is the other reason why I keep coming back.   Chock full of some unique options and always full of flavor, I now have about 5 things on my regular rotation.  The Hangover Breakfast Sandwich is still my morning staple.  Sweet turkey sausage, bacon, eggs your way, it is truly addictive.   The Prime Benedict is also delicious,, and filling.  No Matter what I get, I order up the Daily Dose hash as a side.     The place is clean and well kept, and there is a real feeling the people there enjoy their job and care about their little place.  They also serve lunch and dinner, and although that business piece has not taken off as much the food is just as good.    Definately a place to check out!

I guess I am not in the Trailhead club.  Walking into a new place can sometimes be a bit awkward.  Where to go, where to stand, seat yourself or not, these things are not always evident.   So I walk into the Trailhead Cafe, not knowing what to expect.  All I know is that it marries my two favorite things:  Bicycles and Food.  It is Sunday morning and a breakfast sandwich soundas great.    Ok Cut to the chase.  I actually never ate at this cafe.   I could not get sanyone to greet me, let alone take an order.  I walked in slowly - trying to get a bearing on this new joint.  I took the universal stance infront of the food counter, which suggest I might want to order something.  A young man after a few minutes showed up behind the counter, made eye contact and did not say a single word to me.  Ok - so he was busy, I never want to be that guy.  He proceeds to chat with a couple of friends.  I figured I would look at some of the kool bikes and let him finish.  After a poilite trip around the shop (on my part), I went again to the counter and took that universal pose of I am ready to order now.  2 or 3 people walk past me, and not a word.  I figured, I was not part of the Trailhead scene and sheepishly made my way for the exit.  15 minutes wasted and still no food or drink.  Now - I know that this must be an anomalie as fellow yelpers like this joint.  I gotta say that this put a bad taste in my mouth (really no taste at all).  I will probably go back and give it a try.  I hope I have a better experience.     This definately falls under the category of a hasty response, but hey businesses go down all the time because of this type of negligent service.  It is a competitve market out there and every guest is huge.  Hope my second try, whenever that may be, goes a bit better.  A

So I went back to The Trailhead after a long bike ride and a thoughtful letter from the owner.  I Like I said before fellow yelpers could not be all wrong so I gave it a chance.  I am happy to say that my expereince was fantastic.  I went in as a regular guest not identifying myself as someone who had a challenging visit last visit.  You would think they had my picture up or something, the service was fast and super friendly and warm, My ice tea was great and so was my breakfast sandwich.  There is a gorgeous single speed in there that I wish I had the $$ to buy.  So, I was the unfortunate recipient of a bad day at the trailhead, but I am now a fan.  I look forward to next Sunday after my bike ride.  A

Sure it's walking distance from my house - so I was hoping I would have a new place for my morning tea.   After finally re-opening after the fire on 16th and Bethany Home, I was excited to check out Luci's.  The design of the the place is fantastic simple, sexy, a little modern and throw in some retro corner grocery feel.  I was greeted with fun, friendly service, and then left with a great pastry and a tasty ice tea for the road.    They seem to still be working out some kinks since the re-open, but I see it only getting better.  In fact I just got myself excited.  I think I am going to head over there now for my morning snack.

The South Scottsdale area is sadly void of decent breakfast options. There are a few who do nice job, but not enough to keep the rotation fresh. I was greatly hoping that BACON would add another much needed breakfast boit to my mix. Sadly, after 3 tries that just isn't the case.   I will try to avoid snarkyness, but this place misses on way too many points. Beginning with decor, the denim booth covers are certainly a matter of taste, not mine, but enough of my friends think that it is cute and unique that I will have to forgoe critcism. The open airy layout seems to just miss, and as with many new concepts there seems to be an identity crisis. Restaurant? Coffee shop? The place is cute enough to forgive a little confusion if redemption could be found in the food and service.   First major problem, 2 of my 3 visits, the place named Bacon had no candadian bacon ????? The food in general is bland and uninviting, highlited by breakfast potatos that have a strange glaze or gravy that I do not quite understand.   Lastly the service, its ok - probably 3 stars for pleasant, but back down to 2 for performance, Twice I had to get up for silverware before I could begin eating, and things do seem to take a while. I promised I would not be snarky so I am leaving out critical details. Trust me or not, a great many faux pas are a regular part of the dining experience.   Bacon is the type of place I really want to do well, both for selfish and altruistic reasons, but I don't see this place having the core to climb out of these early snafus to be a decent place. It has been open long enough to make have made some strides by now. I will keep rooting for them from afar.

It is sometimes difficult to start out busy and maintain great standards from the beginning.  The Parlor seems to be nailing it.  Hip yet comfortable decor.   Very creative design, and I loved he subtle yet present homage to the former tenant Salon de Venus.  As soon as we walked in we were greeted with a warm and sincere smile, and that same enthusiasm was felt by every single staff member we encountered.   Ah the food!  Fresh ingredients, a great light pizza crust, and an original beet salad all  had us raving.   The only minor picky foody issue was the Nectarine Crustada for dessert was luke warm at best, would have liked a nice hot dish to melt that delicious ice cream.    But why nit pic?  This place is a big hit, from the moment you walk past the fresh herb and vegetable garden,  to the fantastic staff and the  savory food, this place is already on my regular rotation.

I have to say I think Zipp's has got it dialed in.  I have never made Zipp's a destination place but now with more of them through out the Valley I find that there is one in my daily path more often than ever.  I usually find myself at the Indian School one where the bartenders are always fantastic and they know what type of experience I need at the time.  I have never had a bad meal, with my favorite being the addictive Manaco Foccacia Sandwich.  Zipp's is emerging or has emerged as the most solid and consistent sports bar and grill in town.

This is one of those places I have driven by countless times, saying,  "we got to check that place out!"   I am glad we finally did.  Trader Vic himself would be proud of this little urban tiki joint.  I will keep it simple today and address the big 3 restaurant components one at a time.  SERVICE  Attentive and happy to have us from the moment we walk in the door, the first time was a mellow Tuesday afternoon.  The bartender/server was engaging and helpful and most of all ,exuded a great pride for his place.   He had a key element you just can't train into staff - Pride.  He was proud of his drinks, his menu, the whole place.  He must have got this from the owner who took time to give us a mini tour and talk about some of the unique and creative design elements.  (in a moment)  On a later visit during the more jumpin' late hours that same excitemnet to be there oooozed from the entire staff.  Refreshing to be in  place where people want to work.  FOOD AND DRINK  The Pork Sandwich was very good and so was my wifes salad, the drinks were authentic yet creative and I can honestly not say a bad word about anything.  I have seem some luke warm response to the food at Hula's.  I believe this is unfair, the food is more than fine.  It just isn't the first reason why I return.    ATMOSPHERE  Unique, creative and original design make this place interesting and fun.  On our mini tour we saw the amazing glass front bar, welcoming huge wood common tables, and stellar use of various materials all coming together perfectly.  The patio was open and comfortable.  We were on a little 1 hour vacation it seemed.  The kind of place that keeps you there once you are in.    For the local downtown-istes, it should be a mainstay of your circuit.  For those of you in the bookends of the valley who only leave your bubble for a ball game, put this on the list of places to hit on the way home.  I will probably see you there.

It is now time after a few visits to chat up the new Vig Uptown for a bit.  It is my belief that this concept, which I call for lack of a better phrase "the tavern concept" is the all the rage in the Phoenix (surrounding) F & B scene.  To the credit of the vigsters they sort of started this wave.  I have heard so many times about new places, that are "Viglike" or "A cross between the Vig and something else.".  So kudos to the Vig for creating a new genre in our AZ scene. The question remains, How did they do at re-creating their own thing?  As is so often the case I wish I had a 1/2 star at my disposal.  I would like to go 31/2.   This is only because as nice as I have found The Vig to be 4 stars just sounds lofty to me for what they are.  Having said that, I choose to round up because they do what they do well and I do not want to knock them down to the blase 3.    The Vig is definatley that good looking girl with nice style and a little edge, that you onlly hope that has a little substance.  The refurbed old bank has clean lines, a great mix and use of materials, a nice flow, and a nice airy feel.  The place is a perect balance of hip and sceney, yet comfortable and the kind of place you want to make a night of, yet a chill place to drop in and have a bite with shorts and flip-flops.  I do wish they would have paid a bit more homage to the bank that they used, but that is just a personal opinion.  I don't know if it is expectation or what but I always expect the food to be a little better than it is.  The menu always has me torn between several enticing and well-described items, which always makes me excited.  The results are a resounding "fine".   From the steak sandwich, to the wings, to the chocolate brownie for dessert, they have all been perfectly OK.  I keep going back and I won't stop but it is the atmosphere that drives me. The food somehow seems to lack flavor.  Even when that seems impossible, such as the carne asada over a potato pancake.  Howver, it is good enough to keep coming back.  The service can be a little slow and dis-interested, but I do find the friendliness and attitude to be better at this location, than the original.    So in the end The Vig Uptown is that pretty girl with a lot of style that is nice to have on your arm.  Is she the best cook?  No, but she at least gives it a try.  Will she blow you away with deep conversation about the secrets of the world?  No, but she definatley has something to say.  Is she cool and nice and fun to hang out with?  Heck Yes, I think we will go out again.

In this uncertain economy I am constantly amazed at how new places are popping up all the time.  As I was driving down Indian School I was surprised to come across this new place Vatra Grillhouse that seemed to just be there one day.  My curiosity peeked I found myself there for lunch the next day and had a fantastic time.    Let me first say that the decor is clean and crisp, airy and flowing and would have absolutely amazing 5 years ago.  In falls into the design genre of he Hip and trendy places that dotted Scottsdale for years and have been replaced by the cozier "tavern" type places.  Even so the place is comfortable and if I was not such a design snob, Vatra has cool vibe.  I look forward to the side patio when the weather allows.   Service:  Now as you can see I gave this place 4 stars so I liked it on whole.  However, I am going to get chippy anyway.   Based on the decor, I feel the owners are striving for some degree of hipness and trend. But the staff looked more Olive Garden or Applebees then a cool Arcadia/Scottsdale boit.  My server was actually quite capable if not incredibly nervous.  The entire crew looked lost and awkward and completely void of any energy and soul.  I guess it is the fact that the staff seemed incongruous with the place that was strange and a little disappointing.   But now we get to talk about the food.   We learned that the named Vatra is Hungarian for fire (or so the waiter told us),  showcasing there grilling prowess. My prime rib sandwich was as good as any I have ever had.  Good portion, tasty caramelized onions and perfect roll.  I subbed out one of the feature salads for my side and it was perfect.  The sausage skewer app was a generous portion, super flavorful and creative.  My friend had the veggie sandwich, which was quality as well.  And yes the veggies were freshly grilled and perfectly seasoned.  I have not raved about the food at a brand new place in a long time like this.  This is certainly an area of great focus and attention for this group.    Just to be clear, the reason why I am nitpicking here a bit is because I want this place to work.  the food is fantastic, and the place is right there on the verge of being a classic for a long time.  Far be it from me to insult the staff or claim to be a designer, but I am an avid restaurant goer and I know what I like.  The food alone will bring me back for another visit and with a little tweaking this place could be a heavy hitter.

Where is my half-star on this one.  It is clear from some of the prvious reviews that this neighborhood place is making an impact on the neighborhood.  Is that too obvious?  Like several reviews before me, The Garage is walking distance from my home.  So, as I anxiously watched grow-up I was hoping it would give us an alternative to the Vig or other related spots.  I would like the 1/2 star on this because there are a few kinks that need to be worked out, but on style, astmosphere and most importantly earnestness, this place deserves the benefit of the doubt.  So 4 stars it is.  Likes:  Comfy and engaging seating for the bar and Patio.  The almost outside bar has a great feel no matter which side of it you sit on.  Service has been friendly and enthusiastic each time I have visited, and the staff truly seems to care about their new place.  That sort of sense of ownership is hard to come by.  The food is definatley tastey and I think their  much talked about burger is one of the best in town.  I told the bartender that it was the perfect balance of a juicy burger you would grill yourself at home, with all of the flavor and quality of a great restaurant burger.  Good stuff.   Location:  I already told you it was in my backyard.  Challenges:  I spoke of the bar and patio as hitting the mark.  The rest of the dining areas seems a bit confused to me.  The cozy booths along the back are nice, but leave me feeling detached and left out of the energy.   The calvalcade of smokers going out to the back smoking patio is also a bit busy. The dining area in front does the opposite, I feel out in the open and exposed.  Not sure what the solution is, but it keeps me at the bar or on the patio.   Everything I have eaten has been tastey, but lack of options and a little priciness keeps me from going back as much as I might.  I want this to be my neighborhood bar, but those things keep me from being too regular.    All of this not-with-standing 4 stars it is.  There is pride in the place, and they seem to really care about quality.  I will be back for sure.
