Went for a tour since reviews on Yelp are pretty old. Gate was wide open nothing preventing predators from entering, classrooms are entered from street side with no locks on doors. Watched 3 staff members not close gate (one leaving, one coming, and one getting drinks with kids all at seperate times) One adult to 8 babies in infant room as second teacher was absent. Facility was not clean (floors dirty in infant room staff wearing shoes where babies crawl) As I was walking up heard staff yelling at a small child probably two years old  Something to note they are going through renovation. Perhaps will be better once complete. Also moving to a 15 baby infant room.  Did not enroll.

Absolutely delicious and my favorite place in town. This meal Is always two hours long though, service is extremely slow no matter which server you get. One of my top request is don't starve my thirst and refills are hard to come by. Food makes up for the slow service, be sure to check out the coupons in the newspapers and weekly adds.

I went to try out the breakfast burrito, they say open at 730 but didn't open door til 745. I proceeded to order and was told kitchen wasn't ready and it would be 15 minutes. Seems like their missing out on the high school kids and parents with this.  Food: burrito left more to be desired although it was large it was lacking in flavor. Tortilla was falling apart and super crispy. Not my thing. Salsa was pretty good though! I got eggs, bacon, potatoes, cheese and beans my norm. I should have just got my norm bowl of  cereal.

Delicious Asian food but was not impressed by the sushi. The sushi was warm rather than cold like I like it. We've gone here twice waiters work their booties off and give great service. A great place to go as a group the family meal had excellent value.

Ordered the mushroom Swiss burger, thought it was supposed to be a stuffed buger but all toppings were on top, perhaps I mis read the menu? It was still delicious ordered salad for the side, have to be a little healthy right? Salad was very crisp and fresh!  Went a second time and got a beer samplerer, not to big of a beer drinker but fell in love with three of seven so that must mean they are good! I loved the atmosphere and was pleased with the food and superb service, would definitely recommend this place.

Go here for a non greasy breakfast! Calories printed right on the menu so you can choose a healthier option. If your springing for unhealthy go for the pancakes! Sooo good! Or you can get any breakfast and add two small pancakes for $1! There tea is delicious and they give you a huge to go cup with no weird looks! Service has always been prompt and great, never had any issues.

Used creative moving and packing to get moved out of the 3rd story and into our homes. The workers were very efficient, friendly, and careful. They worked so diligently that the completed the job in less than the quoted time. Nothing was broken or "lost" I would hands down recommend these creative packers and movers.

Very expensive on Saturdays. $8 per half hour for pool. $34 for bowling, $4 for each shoe, arcade games are from $1 and up. It was shiny but for the price we can get this stuff elsewhere.

First visit the manager was very nice and greeting everyone. The fries were nice and crunchy all the way to the end! First experience with poutine and I would totally eat it again! Got the small philly and a 1/2 pound cheeseburger and split with my husband. It was great.  Only downfall is the awkward seating.
