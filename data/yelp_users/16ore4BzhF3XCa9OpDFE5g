Not the best Hilton has to offer, location is good but more than a resort this place looks like a remodeled WWII bomb bunker. Other than that service is the best, most important the beds are top notch and the food is good.

What is a dive bar about ? The people? The service? Yes! But also its uniqueness. Dirty Dog Saloon has proven to me to be one of not the most unique bar I have found in my travels. It has become one of my "most visit" places when I'm in AZ. It is a biker bar, but all kinds of people are welcome and you will feel welcome when you enter the bar, by the people and by the staff.  Fun you ask? Yes! Loud music, beautiful bartenders, God drinks, full bar, cold drinks. What something different? Sit at the bar and tip one of the bartenders  Come on a Thursday and enjoy great great great live music on a friendly environment in which you get to share a beer with the band.  Like crazy? High season on a Wednesday you have the craziest wet t-shirt contest. You like it a little less crowded come on a Tuesday and enjoy a game of 8 ball on the pool table. For me this place would be amazing with draft beer and maybe  some food, at least chips or peanuts? Anyway the way it is now is an amazing concept that puts to shame any Coyote Ugly bar (yes even the original or the movie for that matter) Enjoy!! (I know you will)

You can never go wrong with this place, the food is fresh and no matter the location, it always tastes the same. I have been a customer for the past 8 years and I'm always happy. Once in a while you'll get the new cook that somehow messes up the dish, but they are always fast to make up for it. Great service and good food served fast. I might add that some dishes are better here than in PF Changs!

I'm becoming a regular here, the prices are just right, the food is very good and the drinks are amazing, I will agree with my fellows yelpers, they don't get 5 stars because their service, not bad but could be better.

This is still one of my favorite spots in Scottsdale, quality continues to keep up as well as friendly service, the happy hour is from 4 to 7 I believe so it is good!! The sushi portions are great so are the quality and flavor, still they get 4 stars for their very limited sushi menu. Today I'm taking advantage of the happy hour and intend to get very happy, instead of rolls I ordered the sushi sampler and looks good and plenty full. I guess if you want more options you could go across to Stingray, but you will fin lower quality and yes higher prices. What I like here the most, after the food, is the ambiance, the place is cool and trendy the bar/terrace is the best place to start the night early before heading to a club. If you haven't been here, I know options are plentiful but you have to make this stop a most! Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.

Usually I don't give five stars, i always question my self, am I going to look forward to come again? If so, what is the reason or is there more than one reason? In this restaurant there are more than one reasons why I will be looking forward to coming back!.  First is the service, outstanding! The second I entered I was greatest and directed to my chair... TWO seconds later I had my table set up with a small salad and a small cup of miso soup! Both were excellent! Then I ordered a beer, I hate a beer if its not very very cold and believe me not many restaurants grasp that concept, the beer was perfect! Them the menu, I like to see pictures of the sushi, might not be considered upscale for many, but for me helps me a lot to see the preparation and gives me a good indication to what expect. Place was not packed but there were many busy tables, the sushi I ordered was brought after only 3 minutes! The size of the thing!! And the quantity of the meat! This thing had tons of Tuna and Salmon mucho mas than average! And the taste, wow. After a short visit I'm looking forward to the next. This was a flawless experience and I would greatly recommend!

Visiting Scottsdale as I'm used to I wanted to try something new. New at least to me. I was staring at a hotel near this place and the reviews couldn't be better, but what really made me decide was the pictures showing a very unique kitchen. As I arrived the place was packed but traveling by myself has its advantages I was able to find a place at the bar. This guys are friendly and even though the bar was full, the service was excellent. Started with a glass of wine and the crab cakes. They arrive within 5 minutes oil ordered them. Taste was fresh and not fishy at all, loved how well they go with the salad and sauce they came on top of. They tastes very good but I am sure there has to be another appetizer in the menu that would actually blow my mind. Not a bad start at all  To follow the trout: presentation was a 10, cooked to perfection with skin as it should. The flavor as good and perfect it was, also it was also missing something, I was set up to be impressed but I was stopped just just short of it.   As good as the appetizer and the entree were I would not repeat these dishes as it is my believe there has to be a mind blowing dish... Maybe the scallops ?   To finish the bread pudding... It actually has bacon on it!! STOP THE PRESS!!! I've found it!! One out of three. This is just fantastic and mind blowing. apple and bacon bread pudding with brown butter ice cream is TO DIE FOR!  This gives solid grounds to my theory that there has to be other mind blowing items in the menu I have not tried.  This is a very solid 4 star restaurant, I just need my mind blown 3 out 3 but being so close to do so I will definitely give this restaurant a try

I'm having a Scottsdale over dose and loving it!!!! I love the setting, the place is fun, it was pack and still service was excellent, always checking if I needed a drink (I was sitting at the bar) the staff was incredible friendly and the music was good. I still would enjoyed more if they had a live band, but makes sense its not the kind of place. The drinks were good also, the beer very cold and the cocktails  well served. I will probably become a regular but I have still much discovering to do in Scottsdale!

First timer to this restaurant but an old soul when it comes to Italian food. The restaurant has a nice pleasant vibe, I sat at the bar, it's long and comfortable and provides a great view (I love to see what other people are having). I ordered half a bottle of a Cabernet from Chile, they have a good offering of wines and not expensive at all, love the option of a half bottle. I also ordered the Tuscan Grill Mix, Lamb Chops, chicken and sausage They bring you bread and olive oil, the bread was a bit on the burned side, same as the table next to me, well actually theirs was almost black burned!. Then the food arrived, I was a bit disappointed to find a bit of skinny couple of lamb chops a very thin chicken breast a what resembled a think burned hotdog. Unfortunately the lamb was kind of dry and over cooked, same with the chicken, you would expect dry chicken breast at Olive garden but not here. It was not bad, well seasoned but far from where it should be. Disappointing. Desert menu needs a couple more offerings but that is my humble opinion, I ordered the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake, I know this being an Italian restaurant I should probably had the Tiramisu or the cannoli but oh well, the cake was good, nothing special. Bottom line, and my rating is always on function of this: would I come back? Probably not, there are way to many other options to try instead on spending this kid of money to try to find that good dish in this restaurant (probably there is a few) but not again.

I went for a lunch with a couple of customers, they suggested it. I loved the concept is fresh and the place is nice. I loved the full service bar and the sitting out side. The menu is simple but offers a lot of good options. Service is as friendly as it can be and service is very good. I ordered the salmon with asparagus, it is organic and it was cooked to perfection, melted in my mouth. the asparagus were the big thick ones and also were cooked to perfection, crunchy but soft. My customers ordered a salad, not sure which but looked amazing and plentiful and the Tuna sandwich and also looked amazing. I also tried the lemonade, is it freshly made with real lemons, also fantastic. I will definitely will be back, I have to try so many other option on the menu!! This will definitely become a favorite of mine.
