FILTHY! NASTY! UNSANITARY PLACE!! I am new in the area and get my nails and feet done every other week.... I seen this nail ssalon on Yelp and decided to treat myself and find a Salon I can keep coming back too.... Not only was this place Super small, but VERY UNSANITARY!!! When doing my pedicure they did not take out anything new out the package but pulled out a dirty box and used it on my feet. I looked around and seen NAIL DUST everywhere like they havent cleaned or wiped anything down in months or years!! I sat down to get my Nails filled and looked at the displays on the walls and cabinets filled with nail dust and fingernail clippings. Dirty walls.... I thought to myself NEVER AGAIN will I come back here. I sat down on the otherside of the room to dry my nails in the dryer and looked under the dryer and nail clippings and more nail dust inside the dryer! HOW DOES THAT WORK??? I aint never out of 15 years of getting my nails done seen a place this FILTHY!!! Can u say NAIL FUNGUS! DONT GO THERE!!!!

HORRIBLE!!!!!! My husband and I wanted some good breakfast there were some mixed reviews on this place, so we decided to try it... I sat down and ordered the Strawberry Waffle and bacon, my husband ordered the chopped Steak and eggs... My SO-Called strawberry waffle came with NO strawberries and the bacon was thin as paper. I asked where my strawberries were to put on the top of my waffle and she said they were inside my waffle... MY WAFFLE LOOKED LIKE A BIG STRAWBERRY EGGO BUT FLATTER THAN A PANCAKE. To top it off my Husband got his SO-called chop steak and eggs...LMAO they brought him a fried HAMBURGER Patty dripping in grease! Sent it back, left and went to mcdonalds.... WAFFLE HOUSE MY ASS!!!!!!!!!!

Me and my husband just moved from Seattle moved on Bell rd. Kept seeing this restaurant ... Pulled it up on Yelp and decided to try it.... I ordered the Carolina Ribs, he worded the fried chicken, also had the fried Zucchini ..... By far the Best BBQ I have tasted in a Long time.... The fried chicken is off the hook.. Portion sizes were great huge.... MY HUSBAND AND I ARE NOW GOING TO BE REGULARS...... WE WERE DEFINITELY SATISFIED! !!
