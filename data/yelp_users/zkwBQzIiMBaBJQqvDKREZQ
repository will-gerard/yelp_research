This is one of my favorite breakfast places. Also must be many other people's, too...because they get busy on the weekend mornings! It's nothing fancy - down home, home-cooked food. Heavy on the grease, the carbs, and everything else we probably aren't supposed to eat. But they have healthier choices also.   What makes this place is definitely the service. It wouldn't matter if I went in every week or once every several months, they make you feel like they remember you every time! Very friendly, quick and efficient. The servers seem to always be the same, and they have impressive skills when you consider how busy they are from the time they open, through the lunch hour.   Prices are certainly reasonable, and the portions are large. Every time we've made special requests when ordering, they've been executed flawlessly. If there are any events going on in Cave Creek or Carefree, prepare for the place to be busy.

I recently had dinner at Cocomos and wasn't exactly disappointed, but I wasn't really pleased, either. I like the atmosphere of the restaurant and decor, but the food was lacking. It seems like I remember it being much better in the past, but now it's completely forgettable.   We had the Nachos as an appetizer, which were good - how do you mess up nachos? I had the coconut shrimp, which was overcooked. The dipping sauce was supposed to be guacamole based, but it tasted mostly like sour cream so I skipped it. The veggies as the side order came out colder than the rest of the food, and were limp and mushy. The seasoning was overbearing, as all the flavor had been cooked out of the vegetables. One person had the cheeseburger, which they said was delicious, loaded with greens, and cooked perfectly to her order. Another person had the fish and chips, and the fish was over cooked and chewy. Both of them raved about the french fries. Another person had the catfish, which was over salted. It was served with rice, and for some reason I guess we were expecting white rice - but it came out with Mexican style fried rice - which just threw us off, I suppose. The menu just said "rice," though, so who knows. She had the same complaint about the veggies as I did. The last person order the Enchiladas Two Ways, which actually comes with three enchiladas. He said they were okay but nothing very special.   It seems like they've trimmed their menu as I remember more items in the past - and they were delicious. Maybe they are focusing more on "bar food" type items, which is fine, but even those weren't executed very well. We all left full, but not satisfied. The service was mediocre...she was pleasant, but did the bare minimum to get by. The place wasn't that busy so I'm surprised she wasn't a little more attentive.   I've been there later at night when it's a bar scene, and it's fine. Once again, nothing special. I've always seen a vast mix of different types of people there later at night - it always makes things interesting. There are plenty of places to eat that offer better food and service though - even if you're just looking for bar fare.

I go to Azool pretty regularly. The service is always good and they have something for everyone. I definitely do not recommend it as a "family friendly" venue, as its more of a sports bar. But they have pool, darts, trivia, off track betting, a large viewing screen and cornhole. Ask about the specials because they tend to be varied and different than the menu items.

I thought I had done a review for Jeff the first time I used him more than a year ago. To my disappointment, I realized I must have forgotten to go back and write it (I originally found him on Yelp).   I've just used him again to rekey my whole house, and there are not enough nice things I could say about his service, timing, execution - he's just fantastic! Not only has he showed up on weekends for no additional charge, both times I've used him, he has just gone above and beyond my expectations. Outside of being a great locksmith, he genuinely seems like a nice, caring person. He also has what I think are VERY reasonable prices, and it's a no nonsense process. I couldn't beat his cost on a Saturday afternoon to change the locks myself.   I will definitely use him for any future needs, and I have already recommended him to several friends.

Have been to Hana a handful of times and continue to be impressed. It is the freshest sushi I have had in Phoenix. It tends to fall on the pricier side, but the quality is absolutely worth it. It's also a BYOB, which is great. The servers are attentive and efficient, and can provide lots of information and suggestions. Don't forget to check out the specials board behind the sushi bar for some interesting choices.   The menu seems a bit more traditional, but exquisitely executed. The pickled wasabi is fantastic. I recommend using it with any sashimi. This is not a venue where you need to drench anything in soy sauce and wasabi. The noodle dishes are delicious as well.   And don't miss out on dessert. They have selections from Sweet Republic in Scottsdale that are brilliant.

I've been to Gallo Blanco several times now and will visit again. Overall I have had good experiences, and the food is yummy as well. I recommend to visit for happy hour and take advantage of the specials. The tacos are delicious, but the servings are small, so HH is definitely the way to go for the price.  I've tried all of their tacos and the carne asada and vegetable are my favorite. The carne asada has an amazing charred, vibrant flavor, and the veggies are always perfectly cooked, not soggy. The fish changes as does the market, and they have been pretty good. I really enjoyed the seared tuna when they offered it. The pork taco is good as well, but the sauce is very sweet so it's not my favorite. The shrimp taco is my least favorite, as it has been over cooked each time I've had it.   I really enjoy their guacamole - the citrus in it is what makes it! It has a nice mix of sweetness, tangy, and spicy. We have had it once, however, when it tasted completely different and was a little bland. Maybe a different cook?  The service is usually good. Sometimes it's a little slow, which is surprising as the place hasn't been super busy when we've been there, but we also know we've had some servers that were brand new, and they definitely tried their hardest, getting all of our questions answered even when they didn't know the answers just yet.   Don't miss out on the horchata, either. I believe they make it themselves in house, and it is fabulous! Not too heavy or creamy. Getting one to go is a must on your way out!   The setting of the restaurant is nice. It's not overwhelmingly modern or artsy - but their furniture and tables are unique. It gets pretty dark in the restaurant once the sun sets and you'll be under candle light. I believe they change out the artwork, since I have seen different things, which keeps it interesting.
