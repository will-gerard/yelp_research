I'll start with the positive.  It's a nice place to watch a football game.  Our seats weren't great, but the sight lines were good, and although I make it a rule to hate domed stadia, I couldn't hate this one.  The inside of the dome looks much nicer than the inside of any stadium dome has any business looking.  Probably the coolest thing about the place is that the field moves.  It sits on a huge tray that slides out of the stadium's southern end.  So when the stadium's not in use, they leave the grass outside to get some sun!  Cool, huh?  And now on to the negative, because the negative almost completely cancels out the positive.  It's sometimes difficult to get to and from sports stadia and arenas, especially those that stand in the middle of densely populated metropolitan areas.  The reasons are obvious:  A lot of people are trying to get into (and then out of) an already crowded area.  In most cases, besides adding shuttles from distant parking areas and/or increasing public transit to the stadium or arena, there's not much that can be done.  University of Phoenix Stadium shouldn't have this problem.  It was built from scratch in a completely deserted part of Glendale, Arizona.  It's right next to the freeway.  There was nothing but empty land and farmland on two sides, and the other sides weren't densely populated.  So it's easy to get into and out of, right?  Wrong.  We got here two hours before kickoff time on New Year's Day, so we thought we had plenty of time, but because the parking configuration and the traffic "control" are so horrible, however, we made it to our seats exactly two minutes before the actual kickoff, which was fifteen minutes after the published kickoff time.  If my cousin hadn't made the right (and completely random) choice of driving lanes, we might have missed the entire first quarter.  The stadium is pretty ugly from the outside.  I guess I shouldn't expect much from a place named after a for-profit "university" that neither has a sports team nor offers any kind of comprehensive education, but the difference between the inside (good) and outside (awful) is striking.

Before I knew it was a local chain, NYPD Pizza served as an oasis of semi-authenticity amid a sea of Brea, California-like national-chain-store hell.  My parents and I were frantically driving home from a bloodbath of a college football game, but we weren't going to roll the dice and wait till Blythe, California, and settle for its pathetic Denny's.  No, my intrepid readers, I got off the freeway at North Dysart Road--and there was South Bend, Indiana-inspired authenticity to that random choice, though it's difficult and possibly in poor taste for me to explain the reference--and searched amid the strip malls for something, anything that wasn't an Applebee's or a P.F. Chang or a Mimi's Cafe.  There was NYPD Pizza.  Technically, it's just NYPD, since it stands for New York Pizza Department.  But I'll forgive them the redundancy and almost the blind, tacit approval of police brutality because this restaurant knows what it's doing.  The food is delicious, although I didn't have any pizza.  It comes in large portions, and there's quite a variety for a random Arizona pizza chain.  The service really stands out as well.  I believe four people helped us, and each one was very friendly and efficient.  If someone had to pass along a task to someone else, he or she let us know what was going on.  Even though the restaurant was busy on a Saturday night and we were sitting in a prime booth, we never felt rushed, yet we received our bill right after we turned down dessert.  No fussing or ignoring us just because we weren't going to order anything else; my dad's coffee got refilled, and we were on our way.  The New York theme is done well, and it's actually subtle, which is quite an accomplishment in a restaurant this large.  The bathrooms are clean, and there's tons of parking.  It reminded me of Welcome Back, Kotter, even though no one was yelling "Ooh! ooh!" and there wasn't a closet with the word "CLOSET" painted on the wall right above it in a horrid shade of brown.

The rooms are fine.  The parking is plentiful and free.  There's a strange wall in front of the elevators, and the more I thought about it, the more I was convinced it was somehow an anti-terrorism measure even though I don't really know how driving an explosives-laden motorcycle into an elevator in an airport hotel and going up to the twelfth floor could do very much damage.  But then again, terrorism isn't always rational, and our obsessive fear of terrorism definitely isn't rational either, so maybe I'll stop writing about it--at least in this review?  I would say three stars all the way around, but the shuttle service is a keeper.  Did we catch the shuttle from the airport?  No.  Did we catch the shuttle to the airport?  No.  We drove to Phoenix, sillies!  So if we drove to Phoenix, why were we using the shuttle service?  Well, we were in town for the Notre Dame-Arizona State football game--don't ask, please--and we needed a quick, cheap way to get to the game.  My mom suggested asking about the shuttle service, and they were more than happy to drop us off right outside Sun Devil Stadium.  After the game, we called the hotel, and they were picking up a bunch of Notre Dame fans in the Jack in the Box parking lot on Mill Avenue near University Drive.  The van arrived about four minutes after we did, and although all of us were miserable--don't ask, please--it was nice not to have to wait around for a cab among all these drunk-as-hell kids who are probably pretty regularly drunk-as-hell.  To summarize:  Decent hotel.  Free shuttle service.  Remember, the Jack in the Box on Mill Avenue near University Drive, although I don't recommend spending too much time in that particular parking lot if you're not waiting for the free shuttle.  You might get something else for free.

Do you remember when you didn't think El Torito was bad?  This was way back when it might not have been bad, before it was a big bad chain that had watered and fajitaed everything down to the lowest common gringo denominator--and yes, El Torito is Mexican food for gringos.  When's the last time you saw a Mexican family enjoying their dinner at El Torito, hm?  Garcia's reminds me of Mexican food in the '80s.  No, it's not El Torito; it's actually much better and more authentic than El Torito, even early El Torito.  Everything here reminds me of childhood:  the food, the fresh chips, the darkness, the decor, the servers' outfits, my mother's insistence on ordering fajitas.  I get the sense that there are various locations in Phoenix and that back in the day Garcia's might have been on the verge of expanding beyond Arizona and becoming the next El Torito.  Thankfully, it didn't.  Thankfully, nothing changed, ever.  I was thirty-seven-years-old sitting across the tiled tabletop from my parents, but I might as well have been seven, and maybe my brother and sister were just in the bathroom or sitting with our cousins at another table.  No one sang "Happy Birthday to You," but people--my parents?--did order margaritas, and there were Latino-looking families enjoying themselves here.  Maybe it is watered and gringoed down.  But I don't think so.  It's more like a time machine that deposits you directly in 1984.
