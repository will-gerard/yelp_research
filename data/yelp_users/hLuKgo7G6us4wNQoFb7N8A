Love the sandwiches! We came here because of that cheap Shell gas station before heading back to Socal. We saw the sandwich place and hey, they have good reviews! So we tried it out, and it was delicious. The cheese steak and italian sandwich, really good! Next time I'll try the pastrami.

I don't know why everybody likes the Wynn?! We got a room with 2 DOUBLE BEDS on the 40th something floor?!! Everywhere else in Vegas have QUEEN BEDS, and I could not believe my eyes that they actually put 2 doubles in such an upscale fancy place like the Wynn. I mean everything else was great, like the view of the golf course, the room service... but double beds, come on Wynn. Even Flamingo, TI, Harrahs have queen beds! Also the carpet was really dirty, I think it's suppose to be light yellow, ours was yellow and black. AND we had hotel neighbors, a bunch of douchbags guys, saying we were "too loud" at 9PM on a Friday night?! Who does that?! It's VEGAS, we came here to party, not sleep at 9PM. Walls are paper thin, we heard our neighbors as they heard us.   Someone should ask Mr. Wynn why he decided to be shady on the beds and walls when it's such a luxurious hotel. I'm disappointed, I would not book at the Wynn again.   The hotel was nice, but rooms itself were not worth it.

I love steak, and Palm Restaurant is a good steak house. I got the 24oz bone in ribeye, medium rare. It was really good, I like how they grilled it so it was a little crunchy on the outside and all the juices were there though. We also got the wild mushrooms with it. It was a good big steak, although I eat like a fattie, so I was still hungry afterwards. My only complaint is they don't serve the steak on a hot plate? I know other fancy expensive steak houses serve their steaks on a 150 degree hot plate. I was disappointed by that because towards the end, my steak was cold.  But other than that, it was good. yummm.

I like TI, but I've been to Vegas too many times to know what a good hotel is. TI is a ripe off, they charge you $20/night plus tax for some bullshit amenities "internet, gym, and newspaper" who the fuck uses those things? I came to Vegas to party and gamble! Not stay in my room to go online (and I have my phone for that), and to work out at the gym, it's my vacation, and who the fuck reads the newspaper?! in Vegas?!   The rooms were clean, bed was comfy, water pressure SUCKS, and the toilet is outdated... it's at the northern part of the strip, it's a long walk to the middle of the strip. Also they have HORRIBLE check in lines, a line of like 100 people and only 2 staff. WTF right?! And the check out line is insane too!?! WTF is that right?! They don't have speedy check out like just calling them from your hotel room. Hella stupid management. I also booked for memorial day week, HORRIBLE rates, i paid $230/a night, what a ripe off right?! DAMN NEVER AGAIN. With that pricing I could stay in Caesars or Bellagio with better amenities!  next time I would NEVER stay here again. I rather pay some extra bux and stay at Venetian or Palazzo, or pay less and be in the middle of the strip by staying at Flamingo or Harrah's.

LOL. You are probably wondering why would you stay here? My friends and I stayed here because we got comp'd since we go to Vegas often. We chose this over Flamingo/Bally's/Paris (sister hotels) because our friends were staying here as well. And boy, we heard all the horrible stories...and I must say, most of them were true.   It was pretty gross, I think this place is the cheapest on the strip, but quality is also the cheapest on the strip. I never had high expectations, but it was pretty disgusting. The room was small and outdated, stains on the ceiling. The balcony floor was dirtier than the streets of Vegas. The windows were thin as hell and there was this one car alarm that kept going off. The hotel was confusing to roam around. The parking structure is old as well, and to enter it was old. There were 4 elevators that went up and down, and you literally have to wait 10 minutes to get on, there were a LINE of people for the elevators. Rooms were stuffy, old AC system...Hallway floor were old and dirty, everything was reallly outdated.   Good drink service though. Not many tables. Some of the dealers were very rude. It was overall everything I expected though...dirty, disgusting, and yuk.   On the brighter side, I heard they are going to put $30 million to rennovate this place! Hopefully it'll be better!

It's a good steak place, I'm a steak lover and they have a prix fix menu, which you can save if you want a salad, sides & dessert.   For appetizer we got the seared tuna pieces & calamari & this weird sweetish thing. the tuna pieces were good, but they put like flakes of seasalt in it and it tasted weird when you ate it, but the tuna was good. Calamari was good, and the weird sweet pastry like thing, it was okay. more like a dessert than an appetizer/  I got the prix fix menu. I thought it was a good deal. I got the kobe flat iron, it was cooked to perfection. I got medium rare and it was medium rare! Love it. I also tried a little piece of my sister's filet and it was nice and tender, melts in your mouth. The sides were okay, fries weren't any specials, and the mushrooms were okay, it woulda been better if they were all portebello mushrooms.   Dessert: creme burlee, so disappointed. I love creme burlee, but their creme burlee was not great. It was thick and chunky. I love my creme burlee to be creamy and silky. not a fan of their dessert.  overall, steaks are great here! they dont come on a hot plate =(

I never been to the French Laundry or a Thomas Keller restro nor will I ever get resos there, not because I don't want to but because I heard it was near impossible! So what to do? Settle for his other nearest restro- Bouchon!   Bouchon is not a Vegas flashy restaurant and it won't cost you an arm and a leg. The price is very reasonable. You also get that great customer service (as we did). Bouchon is located in a weird hidden spot and we actually made resos 2 months in advance, we didn't really know how busy it'll be... so we decided not to risk it. FYI it wasn't that busy when we went, but then again it was a Sunday night.   We started off with the table bread- which was delicious and homemade as they have their own bakery. My BF couldn't find a beer he liked and the server was nice enough to let him taste several. We decided to feast and ended up ordering the charcuterie plate, dozen oysters, mussels, steak frites, and bouchons dessert. Man they were all delicious! The charcuterie board came with patay and it was the best thing ever. I would love to have that to put in my Vietnamese banh mi! My entree was the mussels and they were cute small mussels but there were literally over 50 mussels! It was more than plentiful and delicious. The saffron broth was amazing. The steak was good too and the oysters were very fresh. The dessert- 3 bouchons, a pretzel ice cream and a marshmallow thing with a salted caramel bar inside was amazing. It had crazy flavors from sweet to salty to savory.   We were VERY happy that we got to try Bouchon. It also didn't cost too much like other celebrity chef restaurants AND Thomas Keller delivered! Amazing, we'll come back next time! Totally impressed.

Every time I'm in Vegas, I wanna hit this place up for a late night snack. The food aint bad, portions are huge, prices are not bad for Vegas, big, can accommodate large parties. I think it's the same owners of cheesecake factory...but I like this place!  Lots of food choices, they even have good breakfast!

The best faux pho ever! It's called "zen noodles" and it's pretty much pho but none of that unhealthy msg or oil. The broth is similar but very light and more of a lemon grass flavor... it's soooo good! Especially if you've been drinking all night and just want some homey pho...the zen noodles does the trick. You don't even need sriracha sauce or anything to make it flavorful.   I had it 3 times here, after each night of drinking! It did save a hang over every day. Sooo good!

What happened to the Wynn buffet??? It's so low end now and I feel like they cheap out on their food offerings!   First rule of buffets: eat the expensive items such as crab legs, shrimp, prime rib/steak and forget the fillers, carbs and inexpensive items like chicken, sausage, pasta.   My BF and I hit up 3 buffets this weekend: Bacchanal, Flavors Buffet and the Wynn. The verdict: the Wynn is the worst and cheap out on their buffets like their beds and decor in their rooms. I am no longer a Wynn fan after staying here and the room was just so cheaply decorated and had barely any finishing features and the largest beds were full size if you request 2 beds, whereas every other hotel had queens. And now the last straw was the buffet. The first rule couldn't apply because they didn't have any expensive items, mostly fillers. I swear we thought we saw pictures of lunch crab legs... Maybe we were mistaken??? Far disappointed I can tell you that!   We came here thinking there would be crab legs or even shrimp for lunch as other buffets on the strip have crab legs and shrimp for lunch. This one cost about $40 ish each and the food was crap. It was all fillers and nothing worth your money. Well I guess the steak was but the stingy ass lady gave only a max of 2 at a time! I asked for more and she ignored me and said next. Seriously?? It's a buffet! And I'm fat, I want more than 2 measly thin steaks without having to keep going back.   Other unimpressive food offerings: lots of carbs, breads, ramen, turkey, sausage, pasta, crap food that cost nothing to make but full of salt and carbs. Not much of a good variety or even worth the high price for lunch.   We were very disappointed and felt ripped off that they didn't have crab legs or shrimp for lunch or any other good items! No seafood! Even Flavors Buffet at Harrahs had crab legs and shrimp! Only "good" thing was the dessert selection was plentiful. I enjoyed my crepe, chocolate covered strawberries, mango tapioca and ice cream.   Other than that, don't waste your money on this buffet. Instead of feeling like a WYNNer you'll feel like a LOSEr.  Ps. I'm a little embarrassed I changed my last name to Wynn. Should have went with Cosmo. Hahaha lol!

What an amazingly awesome show! I've never seen a show done in water. I honestly don't know how they keep their breath under water that long.   Le Reve is at the Wynn and it's a water production. The front seats are cheaper than the higher seats. Why? Because you're on the splash zone! So if you don't mind getting a little splashed it's all good!   The show was awesome. It was based on the girls dream and from what I interpreted- temptations and good vs bad urges. It was a good show! I loved it.  One thing we didn't like was how hot and humid the venue was. I understand though, the water must be warm for the performers so they don't freeze to death! I highly recommend this show!

Rules of a worthy buffet:  1. Eat only meat & seafood, forget about everything else 2. 4 slices of prime rib & 4 plates of crabs usually makes your money's worth 3. Dessert & if you can take some cotton candy and some fruit, that would be a cherry on top  What I like about this buffet is that the crab is warm! And is not heavily salted like Bellagio's or cold. Prime rib was pretty tasty as well. I think it's pretty good for a place like Harrah's, I would actually prefer this to Bellagio and not pay for the name.

For a low end buffet it's pretty good! We came for Sunday brunch which included unlimited mimosa or champagne for about $27 each.   We found that Harrahs buffet is better than the Wynn (which claims to be high quality). Harrahs definitely beat the Wynn on their offerings. But I must admit Harrahs didn't have a good dessert offering like the Wynn. But get this, Harrahs serves crab legs and shrimp and a lot of seafood for brunch! The Wynn did not!   So you can guest what we ate. 3 plates of crab legs, shrimp and mussels each, 2 plates of prime rib. And then some other fillers. Dessert wasn't that great but it decent. No lines!   Also the drinks came coming. I like it when low end buffets tries to lure people in by offering better things than the high end ones. We would be happy to come back to Flavors for lunch! Also you get discount if you have a players card.

Olive & Ivy sounds cool because in SD we have "Juniper & Ivy^ and it's a super cool spot, so we were hoping Olive & Ivy was super cool too... turned out the name wasn't lying!  We couldn't decide were to go for brunch so I yelped "bloody mary" and O&I came up so being alcoholics we needed our morning fix...well by the time we woke up and came here it was noon. We were able to make resos through opentable and got seated really quickly. Upon being seated we were greeted by our server and ordered drinks- Bloody Mary & Gin Greyhound.   Bloody Mary- good mix to it, it wasn't watery. Garnish was a bit bare, but my second one they stepped up the garnish game (olives, lemon & celery). I love BMs were  you can get a lot of garnishes. My friend hates gin, but he said that was one of the best grey hounds! You can't even taste the gin. They were pretty generous on the alcohol portion as we left with a great buzz.   Now on to the food! The house bread that came with pesto dipping sauce made it all better. I love bread with good dipping sauce. Plus one for that! I couldn't decide if I wanted breakfast or lunch as now it's noonish and it's already really hot in Scottsdale. So my friend and I decided to order lunch portions and split it. We got the prosciutto flatbread and the lamb gyro. I'm glad we got both because O&I is mediterranean and it didn't disappoint. The highlight was the prosciutto crudo flatbread with an egg on top. They also had basil and rosemary potatoes on the flatbread. It was soo good and portions were generous. We were able to take half the flatbread back and ate it a few hours later and it still tasted good!  *Side note: One of the bartenders looked like Manny Pacquiao,,,and we came on the fight weekend. We really wanted to go up to him and say "hey you're going to be late for your fight" but I'm sure he gets shit from everybody that weekend.

Yummmers... the gelatos were looking perfect in their display and presentation was on point. So many flavors to choose from, many friendly staff to help you.   I'm more of a fruity person so I always opt for a fruity option. When I was in Italy I went on a gelato eating spree- breakfast, lunch and dinner. And this place reminded me of why I wanted gelato because it's oh so delicious. I went for the some kind of berry mix (as usual) and it was delicious! My friend got the thin mints gelato and that was OMG good! It was a perfect balance between the actual thin mints and the vanilla. One thing was I felt the portions were smaller for the price. I believe it was like $4 ish and the scoop of gelato was stingier than others I've been too. It was deceiving because it looks round and full at the top but there's nothing down in the bottom ... boohoo.   Oh another thing I liked about this place was you can sit on the patio and people watch, they have misters so you won't get hot. Also one of the few gelato places that is actually well ventilated.

I love oysters...and I always wanted to try this oyster bar...just never got the chance cuz I told myself "I'll only come here when I win" since it costs $22 for a dozen oysters. I never did win though, and I just look and stare at the place...until this weekend, I just decided, WTH, I never win and I want oysters, I'll never get the chance...so I just went anyway. So much for winning!  I love the oysters. It's really good and not too "fishy" tasting. Pricey though, wish they had specials on dead nights or something. I would come back here if I want my oyster fix!

YUM. 24 HOURS!!! Hot sandwiches, bread was good, decently priced. You can't go wrong here. Next time I'm having drunk munchies, I'll be coming here. They have different and unique sandwiches. Would definitely recommend!

I remembered when I first stayed here when they first opened in 2008... I was impressed then and I'm still impressed now.   I like the Palazzo. Their rooms are nicely decorated and finished. The king bed was comfortable and big. TVs everywhere, one in front of the bed, one in the sunken living room and one in the bathroom. There's also a tub to take bubble baths! And bathrobes. One downside is they don't have a mini fridge... Only theirs to put their drinks in but no space for any other things... So we used one of their double sink to keep our alcohol in ice. Also they tend to give you free things, we got 2 free coffee from Cafe Presse each day.   I've stayed about almost everywhere on the strip and I would consider Palazzo as one of the top 5. I wish they had a popular club though, Tao and Lavo doesn't count because Tao is in Venetian and Lavo is more of a lounge...

It's rarely that I go to a steakhouse only now with all the study done on "red meat" is bad for you and blah blah blah. Who cares, you only have one life to live and eat what you want. If it was up to me ill eat steak everyday... Unfortunately I don't have that kind of money to blow...   Cut is expensive and by expensive it's not like your average expensive steakhouse... This here, is not the type of money you can blow on steakhouses unless you won a good amount in the casinos. The cheapest and smallest steak will cost you about $60... High 60s. I don't think I ever got treated to this luxurious fine dining.   To spear my BF from hundreds of dollars I chose the cheapest cut and style of meat. The filet mignon, age dry to something days from some mid-west state. It was very tender and perfectly cooked. It didn't have much seasoning in it so you can taste just the meat, but they put sea salt on the table and a bunch of mustard. I don't get the mustard... They said it was a Austrian thing. But once you sprinkled some sea salt on, it was excellent. We also had the tuna tartare and it was amazing! Good recommendation by our waitress.   If you're celebrating something or won big, come to cut for one of the finest aged steak!

When in Vegas, I always make a trip to Grand Lux and only eat one thing of theirs: the Zen Noodles.   Yes it's totally a rip off ($15) spin of "pho" and also pretty white washed version of pho. But I like it! The broth is lemongrass flavored (not beef) and they use chicken. You add bean sprouts and spinach and ask for sriracha and you just made yourself a healthy pho! The broth is sour so don't expect a beef flavored. And you don't really need sriracha but I love it spicy. It's a really good spin on pho. My GFs and I always get this late at night! Since grand Lux is open 24 hours, we eat here after clubbing.   You don't know how many times zen noodles saved me from a nasty hangover!

I don't know why I never wrote a review for XS. First of all I've been here when they first opened back in 2009 I believe. When the lines were crazy and it was the hottest new club, and now 6 years later im still coming back and it gets better and better.   At first I didn't enjoy XS because it was packed then they opened more outdoor seating and the upstairs. XS will be one of the few clubs where you can sit anywhere or find a spot to sit. They have drinks specials for girls and hot DJs with cool lights and sound effects. The pool is also a good addition as it was the first to have a pool open to clubbers. People can actually swim in the pool (rarely though). Bartenders are quick. Drinks are expensive. 2 bottled waters and 2 red bull costs $40. Yes, I'm serious. Be prepared to go broke.   My friends and I always have a great time at XS!

This is one of the newer hotels, but people told me it was dark, for dudes, and not that great. The aroma is vanilla! I actually liked this better than the Wynn. The rooms were queen beds and the bathroom was nice and big. Although it is dark, but who wants to see the face of the guy/girl you just picked up, the dark will just help with your beer goggles!   Only thing I didn't like, it was complicated using the technology in the room for the light switch, took us girls awhile to figure it out... but it was cool. I would book again.

So overrated!! I've been to the original one in NYC and this one they just butcher everything.   Breakfast is served until 2pm... And no other food items, unless you do the to go order outside. Another thing was this place was totally empty on one side (few people sitting) but they make you wait for like 20-30 minutes! There wasn't anybody in the restro!   Food was okay although I've been here for dessert and it's definitely better than their mediocre food. And service. Service was extremely weird. Like our server was sooo very attentive in the beginning when we didn't need her. We didn't even have a bite of our food when she'll come around and ask how was everything. Then when we needed a box and the check she was no where to be found. Actually we saw her checking out her nails and tried to wave her down. It was so hard to get her around when we needed her.   For reals, this isn't like the real serendipity. Don't bother or waste your time in the restaurant. The to go line and food looked better and easier. Also be prepared to pay an arm and a leg for a breakfast.

I am impressed by the rooms! The best rooms on the strip.   We got comp'd for a Terrace Studio, and amazing! It was actually like a little studio on the strip. It had a nice balcony, ours faced Aria and we could see the pool. The room was really nice, lots of decor, furniture, and it felt like a studio that someone owned. 2 flat screen in the room, long comfy couch, furniture on the balcony, bed was a king size, bathroom was really cool, the tub was also a hot tub.   Instead of like other hotels who have a security guard at the entrance to the elevator, at Cosmo you had to put the keys in the elevator to actually even press the floor level. I find this more convenient then the security guard.   I actually did feel like I was a baller bachelorette living on the strip! Amazing hotel!

SEA has honestly good tasting Asian food, but I can see why most people gave it a 3 star (because of their ridiculous prices!) But really, what do you expect for a place to succeed on the strip? Or even in a casino? It's gonna be pricey!  I never ever thought I would ever pay $18 for a bowl of pho, that's like 3 PHO BOWLS every where else! Can't complain much if there's no where else to get Pho on the strip close to Cosmo. And the pho was actually pretty darn good! They sure do give you a lot of noodles & meat, and a big bowl (but still doesn't justify the $18 charge). Still, it was tasty. My friend got the Bun Ria ($20) and it was a really good, probably one of the better ones I've tried anywhere else.   So the pricing of course is absurd, but the food isn't bad! If you are desperate and do not want to pay a $10 cab to get some Pho Kim Long (in Chinatown/Asian square) I say this does the job. Kind of evens out if you think about it...

This place sucks now!   2 years ago they had a Vietnamese menu with pho, vermicelli, rice plates and bun rieu. They changed their menu and we asked the server about the old menu, he said (in broken English) the chef "went away" (we thought he said "ran away")... And that's exactly what we should have done when we heard that there's a new chef! RUN AWAY NOW!!   They still have Vietnamese pho but more Thai now. The WORST pho ever! My sister found a hair AND a bug in her soup! She asked them to take it back and they took forever for another one, she wasn't hungry after waiting another 30 minutes for pho. My other sister found a hair net in hers but she decided to just eat it. The pho was lukewarm, the broth was salty and since it wasn't even hot the meat didn't cook and it stayed raw. My friend asked if they could just microwave her pho for it to be hot and cook the meat, again it took forever. How long does it take to microwave it? The only good dish was the drunken noodles, which wasn't exactly hot as well. We also got the seafood soup and it was cold, and too sweet. It's like they let it sit out... I don't think the chefs in the back are actually chefs, they probably hired a chef school drop out... I mean, pho soup should be hot, not lukewarm.   You probably wondering, why are we getting pho on the strip? And not go to china town... We didn't have cars and were hungover and SEA is across from our hotel, trust me, paying $21 dollars for nasty ass cold pho with hair and bugs was not what we were looking for... This place should close down, it's a disgrace to Pho restaurants out there. I'm ashamed that I ate this.

I'm definitely impressed!  For an extra $10ish you can add on unlimited mimosas, champagne, or bloody marys for the Sunday brunch! Yes please, it pays for itself in 2 drinks! (I drank 4) Only bad thing is, I drank on an empty stomach and didn't feel at all buzz or drunk, so it means there's barely any alcohol in the Bloody Mary's! Still a great deal though!  I suggest you try the korean short ribs, prime rib, eggs benedict, crab cakes, bone marrow, and their delicious desserts (mmmm chocolate covered strawberries!)! All their options were unique and really tasty. Their desserts have great options (except fresh fruit they need more) Definitely beats the Bellagio!

Food like this exists?! In Scottsdale?! I think Scottsdale has better tasting food than San Diego! I saw Citizen on yelp and had my eye on it but was a bit tainted because my friend and I have bad experiences with "gastropubs" or at least the ones in Cali. It always turned out to be horrible tasting food that tries tooooo cool and overpriced... we took the leap of faith and said fck it lets do it, maybe Scottsdale gastropubs will be different, and indeed it was!  We couldn't get reservations (place is packed for a good reason) but the hostess said there were bar seats available, and we were cool with that. We just wanted food in and out. Also it was fight night, all the other bars were charging $20 each, why not spend that money on good food instead?   I couldn't believe how good the food tasted here. I was in shocked because... well it's Scottsdale, wasn't sure if this was a foodie mecca. Citizen (and amongst other places) proved me wrong. We decided not to stuff our faces and instead get 2 apps and 1 entrees.  -Chia Seared Tuna: the best seared tuna and most creative seared tuna I've tried thus far...and I eat out a lot (1130+ reviews). The chia seeds were unique and gave it an amazing crunch! Put that with the asparagus puree, black-like rice and a spicy puree...it was a burst of flavors in your mouth. We licked the plate clean. -Crabcakes: For a landlock town, they sure weren't stingy on the crab meat! Every bit had crab and the breading was at a minimal so you actually tasted the crab!The aioli was also good on it but it was flavorful itself you probably didn't need it! -Pork Osso Buco: We usually have lamb, but pork is also a good alternative. The pork by itself is dry, but if you actually mix all the flavors it was not at all dry and had sooo many flavors. The polenta that tasted like butter and cheese with the roasted tomatoes and kale... it literally made my mouth melt and fall in love with this dish. The kale was cooked perfect! I can eat this everyday.   Everything we had that night was excellent. This place sure was not the hype. Service was great, good was great, company was great... I think this is as good as it gets in Scottsdale for dinner... put this in SD and it'll be the new "it" restaurant. *Hint Hint* Come on over

Been here for the first time this weekend. I've been to every other club, but this was pretty small, just had a "hip hop" dance floor and an "house music" on the roof. Nothing special...  My friend got VIP bottle service, and we were on the hip hop dance floor and just overlooked the dance floor which was nice. But I must admit, this place has the ugliest people in Vegas I've ever seen at a Vegas nightclub (been to Tao, Jet, Pure, Tryst, XS, The Bank, etc) and this like I said, is by far the ugliest people ever. I think since it's not one of the popular clubs that they let anyone in and don't discriminate. I'm not saying I'm hot stuff, but I'm saying for Vegas standards, the people here (especially guys, 1-10) were probably a 4 all around. I tried to drink to get beer googles, but the people weren't getting any prettier! Also it's like a low standard club or something, I saw some girls wearing JEANS and a top, and they still got in and they weren't hot...  I would not come back just cause it's small and full of not good looking people. The music was good though. But it was okay. I say you go to a better night club in Vegas, so you can get that Vegas experience.

STEAK & EGGS!!! They use ribeye for the steak, and it was delicious! I would come here again for breakfast if I would, it was decently priced, and breakfast/brunch was good. Food was delicious! French toast was really good too. I would definitely come back for brunch.   Service was kind of slow. The guy looked like he was new because he was quiet, reserved, and didn't make any eye contact.   We came to the bar for happy hour at 4-7pm, the candy themed drinks were delicious, really sweet (duhh sugar factory) but it was good! Can't taste the alcohol but it was plentiful.

Fried chicken and waffles!!! Delicious. They caramelized the fried chicken, so it's all crispy and sweet. The waffles were fluffy and delicious as well. I love this place!

My first show in Vegas and I've been here like more than 20+ times. It was an EXCELLENT show. My friend who's been to other main stream shows said this was by far the best.   I thought it was good because it was smaller, intimate, funny, sexual, lots of good moves, audience engagement, you were at the edge of your seat every time! The performances were very impressive. I was amazed and wonder how they did it... crazzzzy.   What a great show! I would write more but you should see it to believe it!!

It could have been a great experience...but service totally ruined our "good experience". So why a 4 star? Because the food was still great, just service was... ugh. You would expect much more from a place like this. So when you come in, they only give you the drink menu to order, then 15 minutes come to get your drink order. Then 15 minutes later they give you the regular menu. 10 minutes later then come to get your order, and if you don't get an appetizer, the waiter "frowns" upon you and would tell you this "well your entrees are going to take longer to come out because you're not ordering a appetizer" That doesn't make sense? Because if we order appetizers, wouldn't it take even longer for our entrees to come out? I think he thought we were cheap, and that was not the case.   We ordered beers, and didn't want appetizers because we didn't want to get full. We didn't even touch the bread. We know with steak places like this, the steak is huge and appetizers would make us even more full. We also order 2 sides (potatoes & mac n cheese) and the waiter was like "you would usually order 3. We felt like he was trying to up sale on everything and gave us an attitude when we didn't take his recommendations. I felt he thought we were cheap and didn't want to order a lot. FYI, we had a show to attend and couldn't waste our time on food we didn't eat. Ugh, it's service like this! Vegas nobody gives you good service because they will always have people coming, but geez, this guy man... we gave him more than 20% tip too. He doesn't deserve it!   The steak was good. I shared a porterhouse for 2 with my bf, the filet melted in your mouth. Good filet part. The NY strip part was good, wasn't the best, but it was good. Not the best steakhouse I've been too (probably service turned us off a bit too) Sides were great though, the mac and cheese was sooo good.   We made reservations a month in advance. We still love Gordon Ramsay. Just be prepare to be judged... but again, "that's Vegas" for you.

This buffet is awesome! We went to 3 buffets in 2 days... Yes you heard me, 3. Gluttony to the max. From the three Bacchanal is the best buffet. I've also been to other buffets in Vegas prior to this binge eating, and Bacchanal is still the best.   It's the best because they have a variety of seafood for dinner from stone crab claws, crab legs (cold and hot), mussels, oysters, jumbo shrimps and all kind of meats from prime rib, steak to ribs. Yes ribs! They also have all the fillers you can ask for: sushi, pho, pizza, pasta, ramen, salads, dim sum, cured meats... I could go on and on but this by far was the most food offerings I encountered from all the buffets in Vegas!   The dessert area was also great, they had everything! I'm in love with this buffet. I would come back here. Lots of options.   We came on a Monday night so there wasn't a line, but I read reviews that you could wait up to hours!! That would turn me off. Come on an off day and you don't have to wait!   This is considered fatso heaven, if I die of obesity it's because of stuffing my fatass here. Beware fatties, as this will satisfy all cravings!

You know, for Vegas this isn't badly priced! My bf and I love Gordon and his shows, and was excited to try this, and because my BF lovesss burgers. We were expecting like $20 for a burger, it was about $5 less, around $14-$17ish. The line looked very long, but we only waited for like 15-20 minutes. It wasn't a fancy burger place, we wore our regular clothes (shorts and a tee). Service was good.   I thought it was a great burger because 1. I finished it all 2. The buns didn't get soggy in like 5 seconds 3. The meat was very tender and flavorful 4. It was the right amount/portion 5. The bun was crispy or something was crispy that made it taste good  Also, share a basket of truffle fries! We didn't even finish it because it was soo thickly cut. The Parmesan cheese on it was veryyyy tasty.   It's worth a try!

I love this concept!!! I'm wondering why SD doesn't have this here??? Please come to San Diego! We need a place like ChopShop (original chopshop, not chopshop teriyaki), and you will do so well here because we have the most Crossfit gyms in America, most superficial people and most people that work out and want to live and eat healthy.   By the name of this place, it's super deceiving. ChopShop? When I pulled it up on Yelp, I thought it was a steak place and overlooked it the first day. Then there weren't much in the area, so I pulled it up and went through pictures and noticed that it was healthy eating. I was stoked!!! I recently jumped on the band wagon to exercising and healthy eating. I had to try this before we left...I mainly was eyeing the shrimp protein bowl. And I finally got the shrimp protein bowl with the Green Glory juice. The green glory juice is nothing new- I usually make this at home and it still very tasty. The shrimp protein bowl on the other hand was SOOOO GOOD! I can't fathom how much I craved this right now... yumm, yet so simple to make. I got it with forbidden rice/black rice...all the juices at the bottom and the fresh veggies mixed in a bowl...it was the best healthy thing I had in a long time. My friend also got the breakfast burrito "cheat day wrap" which looks like a burrito and which turned out to be the best healthy breakfast burrito I've tried, it felt clean..and not greasy, unlike all the burritos here in SD (they all come with a shit ton of fries or potatoes...) We ate the wrap on our car ride back to SD probably 2-3 hours later and it was still the best shit ever. The acai bowl was good too, but it melted a little too fast, maybe because of external temperature, but it had a great amount of fruit and toppings.   I regretted not taking a bowl to go... I wanted to try their tri-tip or chicken...now I'm mad at myself for not taking advantage of this place... Oh also btw, everybody who came in here either came from the gym (all in work out gear) or you can tell they work out (muscles, fitness, etc). Love it.

Seriously? Girls, think 2x before coming here. Yes what the other reviewers said "Do yourself a favor and just go to XS"   Depending on the event at the hotel, the place will conform. If it's a fight weekend expect to see ghetto ass people and rowdy people. The place was jam packed and not nice as the other clubs. We went on a fight weekend and the place was filthy, dirty, and gross. Lots of ghetto people (and cheap!) Not a place you want to be at. After the fight we heard many fights broke out (luckily we were at XS! Woot!)  Also, they don't do specials like other clubs like girls free drink from 10-11 or 2 free drink coupons, and they don't even serve water, you have to BUY a small small Fuji water for $9. No water in a regular glass? That sounds like a bad situation since that will lead to over consumption and by over drinking you get a rowdy crowd and then John Taffer will come and yell at you for letting your guest over drink. I know they want to make money, but with the expensive drinks, is a cup of water that hard to ask for? What if you're friend is totally wasted and that cup of water will save her life, and you just wasted all your money buying their expensive drink. Other clubs will provide you like a plastic cup of water, nope not Hakkasan because they want you to be drunk and rowdy, ghetto and get into fights. I guess it's publicity for them.   Reeally people, do yourself a favor-go to one of the BETTER clubs (XS, Tao, Marquee, etc). You're welcome or I told you so.... hahaha.

Whatever you do, just take the damn taxi. It's not worth the hour wait. Yes it's cheap but not worth it. Totally not worth it.   5 minutes becomes 10, then 15, and an hour. It's those damn crooked cabbers that resorted me to this and now I'm regretting it. Crooked cab to the strip $35, normal cab fare $20, this damn slow shuttle $7.25. Pray you get a normal cab.
