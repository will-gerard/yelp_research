Had dinner here yesterday (a Sunday) for my 31st birthday.  Spoke with Sheldon beforehand to reserve the private dining room for "20-25" people.  After some hesitation on his part, he agreed to not requiring a set menu, and I agreed that my party would be patient with the service (which did not end up being a problem at all).  He also did not require a deposit, which was fantastic.  I got there later than I wanted to, as I wanted to arrive a little before my reservation, but I got there exactly at 7:00 p.m.  After saying hello to some friends who had already arrived and were waiting in the bar, our table in the private dining room was ready after just a few moments.  We went in and began sitting down - the private dining room is off to the side of the restaurant (beyond the bar area) and was great for our party of 20.  There is a men's and women's restroom at the end of the dining room which was great as well, and the tables were organized well enough that it felt like we were eating at a single grand dining table.  Service was very good, especially considering the amount of people we had and that they were willing to do separate checks.  After getting our drinks ordered and delivered (which took about half an hour), we ordered.   For appetizers, the table had the hummus, but a few others ordered the green chile queso (very unique and good), the fried eggplant bites (I was hesitant about the goat cheese as I'm not a big fan, but there is not that much and it just enhance the flavors of the whole dish, which was good), and the bacon-wrapped shrimp (YUM).  All of it was good.  Personally, I also had a cup of the black bean soup (very good, especially if you cannot get enough black beans like myself).  My entree was the surf n' turf pasta, which was really flavorful.  You get two shrimps, which were decent sized, and two medallions of beef, which were cooked well but not overdone.  The fettucine was not al dente but still had a good texture, and the sauce was not buttery/overwhelming.  Everything felt/tasted complimentary, which was a good thing!  We finished things off with their version of chocolate cake, and they had a pumpkin cheesecake which was interesting, but I would have preferred regular cheesecake.    Anyways, I wanted to thank the staff here for a great birthday dinner.  Everything tasted great, the service was good and prompt (I don't believe there was a single issue, which is amazing considering they had 20 people all ordering something totally different, without a set menu), and we all had a great time.  We got started a little after 7:00, and we were done a little before 9:40 (from what I can remember).  For 20 people all ordering drinks and food, that was some efficient service!  I would definitely recommend PCG for a big dining party.  They were courteous, professional, and accomodating.  Fantastic place with very good food!  Thanks!

Great Mexican food. They make their own fresh tortillas that they then package and sell (same with tortilla chips). My company gets them to cater our lunches sometimes and it is one of the more popular catered lunches.   A lot of the other reviews are spot on, and I really don't have that much to add. If you have not tried this place yet, you're in for a treat. Try it out for great Mexican food that won't make you feel like you regret it later!

"LGO" is great. There is the grocery and the pizzeria - if you go there for breakfast or lunch, you will have to order at the grocery and then there is self-serve seating in the pizzeria. They do not serve pizza until the evening (and then they no longer serve certain sandwiches and other breakfast/lunch items in the evening). In the evening, the pizzeria becomes more of the traditional go to the hostess to be guided to your seat sort of thing. That sort of explains the chaos/mayhem some of the other posts have alluded to that can happen in the mornings. However, I believe this particular entry is for the pizzeria, which is more dinner oriented.  Some tasty dishes that I have had that I would recommend:  Evil Princess Thai Chicken Salad Gladiator Pizza Mushroom Party Pizza (add proscuitto) Avocado Pizza (add proscuitto) Fish Sandwich Cheeseburger on english muffin  The guacamole and cheese dip thingy (it's not called that, but I'm blanking) are good too - I believe it's a three dip appetizer platter of some sort.    The food here is really tasty. They also have some nice bottles of wine on their list (and in the grocery). Great place for a non-stuffy date or for a decent sized group of people (although probably not more than like 8) to share a bunch of pizza/apps.   One last thing: parking can be a real pain. I usually just suck it up and valet - it's free if you get it validated in the restaurant. Throw the valet person a few bucks - why not?

This place is fantastic!  It's in a strip mall behind a Coco's on the southeast corner of Thomas and 46th street, I believe. The sign is fairly visible, and I believe there it's only a couple of stores down from the Hungry Howie's pizza place.  The guacamole is great, and they have a salsa I have not ever had before - they're like marinated peppers that are just so light and refreshing. The only minor critique I would have at all about this place is that I'm sure this place could make its own tortilla chips - it seems like the ones they serve with their chips and guacamole/salsa appetizer are some store bought tortilla strips chips.  Anyways, I highly recommend their fish tacos. Definitely the best I have had in Arizona - and probably anywhere else as well. I prefer flour tortillas, but you can get them on corn too. The fish is not fried - which is great - and there's plenty of fish, veggies, cilantro etc. You really have to try it!  For a while they were serving tortilla soup - I would get it every time! I imagine now that summer is coming around and it is getting hot again, that is the reason it is no longer on the menu - but it's so good I don't even care! Bring that soup back - it's so good!  The carne asada is very good too - but I actually like the soup and fish tacos so much more that I rarely get the carne asada. That should tell you something!  I have not strayed beyond those items listed above. Whenever I think about doing so - I just cannot get myself to follow through. Must have those fish tacos and guacamole!!!  It really bums me out that whenever I go to this place, it does not have any customers (or if they do, it's only like one other person/group). It makes me afraid of the possibility that they won't stay open for business - while I would hate to have to wait too long in line to get the food, I would hate it even more if they were to have to close down!   Check this place out! It's very good and you won't regret it!

Very good.  I had the Hana Dog and a new dog that I cannot recall the name of.  Each of them were super tasty and light (for hot dog standards).    I also had the slaw, which is very good.  It had coconut, which I normally don't care for, but it was a good compliment to the slaw to make it unique from other places.    The owner is a super nice guy.  Many of these creations came from his creative mind.  I would definitely recommend stopping in here - it has a fun theme inside!

I went here for lunch to catch up with an old friend from high school.  I learned about it from Yelp! and it was a great choice.  You order at the register, and then they bring the food out to you at your table.  The gentleman at the counter was very helpful and made some great suggestions (such as their thai chili sausages that are the current special).    I had a three meat combination (the sausage, 1/4 rack of ribs, and the apple wood pork loin).  All three were good, but I really enjoyed the pork loin.  It was thinly sliced and had a great flavor.  You can definitely taste the flavor of the smoke.  Very good.  The ribs were also good as they just fell off the bone, and they were not overly fatty.  It came with a good pineapple jerk BBQ sauce.  Very tasty.  I had the spicy baked beans and sauteed veggies for sides.  Nothing too special, but solid and tasty.  Have to have a well rounded meal, right?  It took a little while for us to get our food, but I didn't mind because (1) I was not in a hurry and (2) I could tell that they make their food fresh.  We waited maybe 15-20 minutes to get our food after ordering.  This didn't appear to be some assembly line place.  This is some good stuff!    My meal was $15.99 + tax and a drink.  I believe the 2-meat combo was around $10/11.    They also had a drum set near the line area, and I'm not sure if there is live music in the place, but it would have a nice vibe to the atmosphere if they did during dinner or something!

I just got back from lunch at this place today.  I've been to many places in the downtown area for lunch (I work in the area), and this was, in my opinion, by far my worst experience eating lunch at a downtown establishment.    We arrived at the restaurant at about 11:50 a.m.  I arrived with my party, a group of 5, and nobody else was waiting in line.  As the waitress (they don't have any hosts/hostesses) was trying to figure out how to accomodate our group of 5, she seated the group of 2  that came in from behind us.  No big deal - that was a more typical number for them to seat.  About a minute later, she sat us next to the cash register.  Next to us were two ladies who had ordered their food to go and were still waiting.  I had overheard one of the ladies comment to the other lady wondering what was taking their food so long.  An omen of things to come.  We received water fairly quickly, then was given soup before we ordered.  The soup was fine compared to similar establishments, although it only had tofu in it rather than maybe one or two pieces of chicken.  We ordered our food: two orders of drunken noodles; one spicy green bean with chicken, one ginger chicken with brown rice, and I ordered the spicy eggplant with brown rice.  Not a complicated order.  Especially when considering the menu is simple: they have like 14-16 lunch specials, and the only difference in price is whether or not you order a different kind of protein.  It's cookie cutter, generic Thai food.  We ordered at around 11:55 a.m.  My group and I are all friends, so we were conversing for awhile without thinking about how long it was taking.  By about 12:25 p.m. we were wondering what was going on.  I looked over to the table to my right, which is a table of 10 right next to the storefront window of the restaurant.  A group of 10 people that had been seated after us had already gotten their food and were in the process of paying their checks.  I then saw the group of 2 who were seated just before us finishing up their meals as well.  Not a good sign.  At about 12:30 p.m., I got up from my seat and asked the lady at the cash register if we were going to be getting our meals anytime soon.  She asked me where I was seated, noticed I came from right around the corner of the register, didn't really answer me, turned around to some people and started speaking in a different language to either the cooks or the other waitresses.  I sat back down and she darted by shortly thereafter saying 5 more minutes.  Now I was checking my phone constantly.  At 12:38, two orders came out: one of the drunken noodles and the spicy green bean with chicken.  My two friends began eating, as we had already been waiting for so long.  Two more orders came out at 12:40: the other drunken noodle and the ginger chicken.  I looked to my right: the group of 10 had gotten up and walked out of the restaurant.  I then got my dish.  Needless to say, I was not happy.  As we hurriedly scarfed down our food, we asked for the check.  We noticed that the two dishes that had ordered brown rice received an additional $2 charge, when the menu said $1.  I immediately darted up from my seat and went to the cashier and notified her of the problem.  To her credit, she fixed it immediately.  I then started eating my food.  Considering I had to wait over 45 minutes for it, it was not even all that hot - temperature or spice wise.  I bit into several pieces of eggplant that were still cold - like the stirfry hadn't gotten all the freezer burn out of it just quite, and now it was just cold instead of frozen.  I had also asked for it to be spicy hot, and it wasn't even close to even being mild spicy.  For a dish that is supposed to be "spicy eggplant" and I ordered it hot: well, it wasn't particularly authentic Thai spicy.  We asked them to split the check five ways by giving the cashier 5 credit cards (which is just the norm for downtown joints these days).  I asked her why our order took so long and why a table that had 10 people seated after us were able to get their food, eat, and pay before we even received our dishes.  The only answer I got was thank you for being patient, and that the group of 10 had called in their order.  There were no apologies, and no credit to our meals offered.  It then took them a long time to get us our checks.  The service here was ridiculous.  Apparently, they treat people who call in their orders with more priority than other guests.  (And yet, many take out orders waited near us). That's not quite a solution for a poorly run restaurant.  Nor was the food all that great either.  I will not be coming back here, and I would advise that anyone else interested in a normal length lunch not even bother either.  But if you don't care that your order comes out 45 minutes after you order it during lunch, you get overcharged for items you ordered, and enjoy subpar non-authentic food, well then by all means, go ahead and come here.
