I called and orders three sandwich platters and a veggie platter for pick up the day before I needed them. I show up and no sandwiches! No order! Nothing! They also wrote pick up time wrong on another order so us two customers were fighting to get our orders made first. On top of it all customer service was rude. Bad experience all around! The only reason for the two stars is for the poor deli staff working furiously to make 100 sandwiches in no time flat.

I tried to order to go from this place. The phone rang and rang and rang, when someone finally did pick up they put me on hold until the line disconnected. I called back and had the exact same thing happen. We figured they were just busy and decided to drive there to get to go. There was only ONE car in the parking lot. And the place looked like a total dump, like cockroaches in the kitchen dump.   Forget this place. There is no excuse for not taking a phone order when there is no one in your restaurant.

This restaurant is a lot of fun and a great place to bring people who are visiting. We got the Cowboy Stuff and it was tasty. The salad and bread was great, the meat was all very good, the swordfish was flavorful, corn was perfect. And the cotton candy at the end was a nice cap to the end of a great meal.  I just wish they had more side options, i.e. broccoli, asparagus, etc.

I've been a patient of Steve for about three months. He and his team have both been excellent, not only in helping me recovery, but in having fun with me along the way. Steve's passion and compassion are very evident in all that he does. You know that he genuinely cares about you and will go as far as to share some super secret pie techniques with you as well. If you need a PT in the East Valley- this is the place to go!

The people here have always been so nice and caring to my dog. She's had surgery here as well as a scare with a rib bone she ate. Being open 7 days is a huge plus, as is their walk in Sunday schedule.  My only complaint is that I feel they could have saved me a lot of money by grouping treatments. I had her in back in November (just because she was up for her vaccines) and no one mentioned anything. Now I have to pay for another exam just to get her up to date.

Overrated is probably the best way to rate this place. Any sushi place that requires a "sushi 101" menu is not worth going to IMO. My sister and I can typically get three rolls and get full before we can finish. The rolls here were WAY over priced and very small. They weren't interesting or even really delicious. They were all sort of bland. We had a Rainbow, Dragon and some shrimp thing that I didn't even taste the shrimp in. It ended up costing us $20 a person and we left totally unsatisfied. There has to be better and more reasonably priced sushi on the strip!

I wasn't impressed. The bread is dense and the options leave a lot to be desired. I got a veggie sandwich and even though the ingredients looked great, they didn't sing when all together. The Sundevil was better (I have to give them credit for the spicy mustard, it is divine) but still not good enough for me to go back.

I have yet to have a positive experience here and will be looking for a new doctor now. I've never been able to call and get a straight answer or the right person ever. If it is anything beyond scheduling an appointment, i.e. a simple question such as "since you can't get me in to see any doctor within the next week, can I get an extension on my prescription until I can see the doctor?" you get set into a phone maze, sent to person after person who tell you the exact same thing, "let me transfer you to someone who can help/the office" and then you are back to someone else that can't help you.   I have only been a patient for six months, I've only been into the office twice and have only called three times and I have never had a positive over the phone experience. Of the two times I've gone in, once I had to wait for over an hour past my appointment  time for the doctor and I was the FIRST appointment of the day. This is absolutely unacceptable, especially considering I was there with pneumonia. When I tried to get blood work done, I got caught in the phone maze (actually transferred to the same person three times) only to find out that I didn't need an appointment for blood work even though my doctor told me I needed one, then when I did show up to get it done, the girl "wasn't in."    Once I get my prescription filled so I can make it through the next month-- I'm getting a new doctor because Mountain Park Health Center does not deserve any patronage.

I was not impressed by my visit here. I brought my car in because of a misfire and check engine light. I decided to wait for the car. While I waited, Jason at the front desk had to deal with ordering the wrong parts for a customer's car. He called all over town trying to get the correct parts that day, but was unable to find it in stock anywhere. So he had to call the car's owner and tell him about a "delay." Next, some person complained because they asked the shop to do something, that was on the paperwork, but was not done. And he also yelled at some customer service person because some program there wasn't working. All pretty eyebrow raising stuff.   Then it came to my car. After the diagnostics he told me that 5 of my coil packs and all of my spark plugs were fouled. This just didn't seem right. This isn't the sort of thing that happens all of a sudden, which is what happened to me. One minute fine, the next minute, misfire and check engine light on. I tried to push him to do the minimum possible, but he said that was the minimum possible. Total estimate was over $800. I opted not to do it and took the car home. The tech had reset the light and it drove home completely fine. No light, no misfire.   Since my husband needed the car for a trip that night, we went ahead and purchased six coil packs and a set of spark plugs (total price $230). When we pulled them we were pretty upset, but not surprised, to find that the spark plugs were fine! Not only that, they were probably changed out only 20,000 miles ago. One of the spark plugs was a little greasy, and my guess is that this was the coil pack that was actually bad- not the other four.   I'd like to take the old coil packs to another shop to get them tested. I'm pretty sure they were not all bad like this shop led me to believe. Do yourself a favor- avoid this place. Unless you like waiting too long for service, asking for stuff that doesn't get done, and being lied to.

Not open on Sunday despite the Yelp profile saying otherwise. Thanks for the waste of time.

This place is fun, relax and CHEAP. Their happy hour specials are always happening which means you can eat and drink like an emperor and get out of there for about $20 a person. If you like spicy food AND Japanese, this is definitely your new spot. Everything I've had here has been good, and its a great place to bring people.

I ended up walking out of this place without even ordering. It was way too pretentious masked as artsy for me. This is one of those restaurants operated by people who think their you-know-what sounds like roses and just because they call appetizers "tapas" they can charge an arm and a leg for them. If you want to discuss the dichotomy of society and the benefits of Mao while you pick at a single morsel of duck cooked in the tears of Republicans, this is the place for you. If you want food, go somewhere else.

This place is awesome. It's large so the wait on the weekend isn't bad. Menu is diverse and the food is delicious. Totally recommend the Baja omlette.

We bought some out of town relatives here to do something different. While the  view of the lake are great, we felt the service, atmosphere and food needed some improvement. The chairs were breaking, our server wasn't very attentive (drinks were never refilled) and the food was just OK. The fries were over seasoned and the chicken was dry, but the fish in the fish and chips was good. This place seems like a better place to go for a drink on a nice evening opposed to a meal.

Being in a hotel, many people may not think of Gallo Blanco when looking for a delicious, authentic Phoenix restaurant to eat at. But this is a huge mistake! Gallo Blanco hits all of these marks and more with its amazing food, eclectic atmosphere and focus on high-quality, local and sustainable food.   Even now that I live in GIlbert, I am still bringing visitors to this restaurant all the time. Their guac is among the best I've ever had, breakfast is fantastic, totas are to die for and even their burger is brilliant. Their cocktails are also fabulous. Best Bloddy Mary in town, and their house Margarita puts many restaurant's higher end Margaritas to shame. And don't get me started on the Prickly Pear Margarita!  If you are reading this debating what restaurant to go to. Stop the debate, get in the car, and go to Gallo Blanco

This place is the bomb. You get miso soup, salad and dessert with your order and the food is fantastic. The specials are AWESOME. The 50/50 rolls are great deals and the bugolgi is fantastic as well. The wait staff is all awesome. They are very nice and attentive.

We just checked in. First, it took 40 mins to check in at 12am then when we got to the room the lights were burnt out and there was urine and pubic hair on the toilet. Completely unexceptable even for a one star motel. To see that in a suite of a hotel on the strip, I'm blown away.

Easily the best little Japanese restaurant I've found so far in Gilbert. The food is great and the service is excellent, sure the owners are actually Korean, but that doesn't mean they don't know how to make some mean rolls. The fried rice is delicious, the specialty rolls are unique and very yummy and they always give you goodies like orange or watermelon with the bill.  Oh and the framed phrases in the bathroom are awesome.

We found this place on accident when Olive & Ivy was packed one night and could not have been more pleased! First, the decor is awesome. It's sort of this rustic yet contemporary Cape Cod look and the bathrooms are the best in the city! The service was perfect and the food-- even better. I got the trout with fried spinach and some sort of cheesy vegetable side dish that was amazing. My boyfriend got the spare ribs with mac and cheese. It was equally as good. On and the desert! The trio is a perfect way to end the meal and everything was so good. This is the perfect date night location.

Very disappointed. First- the 'no sugar added' vanilla has more carbs than the regular vanilla. Wtf? They were out of strawberries. The kiwi was underripe and the mango overripe. When I went to get a lid- they didn't fit! Like totally the wrong size! I opened the employee only door to tell apathetic employee about the situation. Her response? "oh, they must have ordered the wrong size" fantastic. That doesn't help! She gave me tape so I could get my lackluster yogurt home. That was nice.

Great happy hour. The food is decent too, great portion sizes. It's super trashy but if you want good drink and food specials this is your place.  One thing that really upsets me about this place, however, is the fact that they leave the TVs on day and night. I drive by every morning at 7 am and all the TVs are on. This is a huge waste of energy and I think they need to stop.

Let me start off by saying I wasn't really expecting much when we came here. It's revolving sushi after all. But I found a Groupon and thought it would be a good opportunity to try out a new place.  Upon walking in the decor is just god awful. From the fiberoptic crystal chandeliers to the lime green walls and orange counters, tacky doesn't begin to describe the place. It was pretty busy too being a Friday night.  As can happen at these places, for the first 40 minutes all we saw was crap rolls. The good stuff didn't come by until we were pretty full which left us very disappointed. We showed up around 7 pm, so maybe we missed the initial dinner rush where all the good stuff was snatched up, but I wasn't really happy to see that the caterpillar rolls and tamago and what not all came out after we had asked for our check.  The rolls are TINY. If there was a Guinness Book of World Records entry for smallest commercial sushi rolls this place would surely win. You can also tell the people making the rolls are either very rushed, or very inexperienced. One of the shrimp roles I grabbed didn't even have shrimp in it. :( They are all very poorly put together with the meagerist of fillings. The larger rolls- on the purple plates- are far better, but you pay more for them. If they've been out for a while you are also greeted with room temperature sushi, which is disgusting.   Biggest complaint, however, was the level of service. We sat for five minutes before a waiter came by. We waited another 10-15 minutes before our drinks arrived. By the time they came, we were on the verge of full and didn't really want them any more. I know it is a large restaurant, but it's not like you are taking orders or serving food! You have very few jobs as a server in this place- to get drinks, to count plates, to get the check and sure, to give the one off menu item. There is absolutely NO excuse for poor service!   In short, we won't be returning. Masa Sushi up the street is ten times better.

Service was painfully slow. One salad was so late,  we sent it back. Shrimp is underwhelming as are their olives and hummus. They only have one restroom for the whole restaurant so expect a wait. Tots are excellent, however and the ambiance is great, although the birds can be obnoxious.
