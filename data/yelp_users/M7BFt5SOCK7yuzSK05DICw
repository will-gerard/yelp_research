Terrific spot in downtown Phoenix!  I love the Panko Chicken, Teriyaki Chicken and the Curry Vegetables first and foremost.  Beyond that, it's all good and healthy portions.  Tankatsu sauce is a favorite right now too.

I've loved this place for years.  It's typical of chop suey houses in other major cities; authentic, perhaps short on style but absolutely outstanding food.  Great people.

Great local spot for breakfast.  The servers were very attentive and make sure the coffee cup was filled.  The food was served quickly, delicious and priced well.  It has the feel of a local establishment, neighborly with a steady cliental coming through the door the 90 minutes we were there for a breakfast meeting.   Places like this are too often replaced by chains and franchises.  This spot reminded me of ol fashioned diner or perhaps Scott's Generations or Good Egg where the servers often seemed to recognize a customer, nice breakfast, pleasant atmosphere and efficient service.

Terrific spot with great vibe. The iced coffee is one of my favorites being cold brewed, smooth and delicious. The Americano is also fantastic if you desire a bit less caffeine.  Sandwiches are very good but the stars of the program are the pumpkin bread, banana bread, blueberry breakfast cake, and assorted pastry items!  Outstanding spot to regroup late in the day too.

Terrific staff with strong, neighborhood atmosphere. We often reserve the room in the back for meetings in the mornings. They have a wide variety of low cost items like bagels, oatmeal, muffins to balance a budget. Great selection of pizzas, sandwiches and salads at lunch.  We also stop by here for dessert and coffee with quiet conversation after having a more formal evening meal. Patio is a great to enjoy the weather when the evening is pleasant. Locally and family owned.

Delicious sandwich. Disappointing service. Very Disappointing experience.  The ticket was about $3 more than I mentally added up because of up added charges. Extra $ for the 7 grain bread, extra $ for cheese, extra because they charged both sandwiches for Avocado when it was only on one sandwich. There are too many other great restaurant choices for sandwiches. I don't like feeling tricked. Buy local ... Better ideas.

We celebrated my birthday at MBB and enjoyed a fabulous time. I had the seared tuna salad and was most pleased. Friendly servers, fantastic host and just a wonderful time for all! We also tried out the usual fare like the Mother hamburger, French Dip and Mac and cheese and we're happy with everything we ate.  Our adult kids bragged on the micro-beers to polish off a great celebration!
