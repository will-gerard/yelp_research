I came here for the first time Saturday night with a large group celebrating the end of our season. This event has been booked for weeks so management had plenty of notice to staff properly HOWEVER it took us about 30 to get a beer after waiting for a server, standing at the bar... We eventually got a table sat there for another 10 minutes with servers walking right by us. I finally got up asked a manager of we could get a server. She informed me that she had Two servers working the area with probably around 100 people and one would be over shortly. A very unfriendly server finally came over to our table. We had a huge fiasco trying to get quarters to play darts, it was just a really bad unfriendly, unorganized mess which is rather unfortunate because we were there to celebrate not to get dirty looks and terrible customer service! Needles to say I will never return to this place! I am on the board for this event so we will certainly NOT go here next year! What a disappointment!!

I have a 2012 Honda Civic and as a women with very little car knowledge I'm always afraid of getting taken advantage of but Filip was very friendly and helpful! He treated me with respect and I am very confident in his work. I had a great experience and would highly recommend him.

This is one of the most unique stores I have ever been to!   Everyone was supper friendly. There is such a great mix of old and new items! What a comfy/cozy atmosphere. I will definitely come back! :)

I love this guy! I've been following Filip around from his home garage, to his Scottsdale location, then to Alpha G and now his very own place that he manages himself. Prices and quality is always there, I don't even have to shop around anymore. He greets me with a smile and is always happy to help me if I'm in a pinch. My mechanic for life, thank you Filip!
