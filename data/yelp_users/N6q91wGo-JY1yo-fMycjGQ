Some of the best Mexican food in the valley! The ribs, el pastor gorditas and chicken chimichangas are some of my favorites. The prices are also very affordable!

This amazing little Italian restaurant is for anyone who wants a good, quality Italian sandwich or pasta dish that will blow the corporate chains out of the water and still somehow cost less (and it's BYOB!).  I'm a huge fan of independent spots and I haven't come across another place like this near downtown Phoenix since I moved here 2 years ago.  This is probably not a restaurant you would stumble across unless you were looking for it given the number of restaurants and businesses nearby but consider yourself lucky if you have a chance to check it out.  The gnocchi with sausage and meatballs was unbelievable!  The sausage and meatballs were spectacular, the sauce was fantastic and the gnocchi were tender and flavorful.  I initially assumed the sausage was from Schreiner's or the Meat Shop nearby but when I asked Carlo, the owner, he told me that he does all of his sausages, meatballs and sauces in-house!    As others have mentioned, the sandwiches are also fantastic and the bread is made fresh locally.  The hot pastrami sandwich is delicious with quality meat and cheese and deli mustard.  This is no over-salted, mass-marketed Quiznos or Subway attempt at a sandwich, folks.  This is the real deal.  If you're stopping in for something lighter grab a sandwich but if you're hungry or in for dinner I highly recommend checking out a pasta dish.  For dessert the cannolis are also fantastic!  I can't wait to go back!

A great local spot for burgers, fries, onion rings and other sandwiches. You can also pile on your own toppings yourself and they have a salad bar (if you're into that). My favorite is the teriyaki chicken sandwich that comes with a slice of pineapple for about $6. I get it on wheat with no cheese and load it up with onions and jalapeños myself (no extra charge). A good local healthy option.   The gigantic burgers with multiple patties and cheese are also amazing in moderation. Everything is made to order. Staff are friendly. Cool place with good value.

It was a Sunday at about 8:50pm and I headed to Maxim.  I arrived at this little hole-in-the-wall location only to realize they were closing.  I was greeted by a woman named Maggie who kindly told me she could make a to-go order if that was okay.  Having worked in food service for several years I was surprised that she didn't just send me away and I was happy to agree.  I ordered the Lemongrass Tofu and the Shrimp & Pork Eggrolls.  I also requested a side of peanut sauce because it's one of my favorites.  Maggie put everything together, told me to make sure to stop in for one of their lunch specials and off I went.  As everyone has previously stated, the prices are definitely affordable and I couldn't wait to get home.  The lemongrass tofu is packed with flavor and it was cooked perfectly.  When mixed with the white rice and peanut sauce this little dish is amazing and it's a steal at $6.  I then unpacked the eggrolls.  I was excited to see that they came with mint and lettuce to wrap them in because I think that always adds another dimension of flavor and freshness.  Again, for a $3 item this exceeded my expectations and anyone would be hard pressed to find a better tasting eggroll in the Valley for up to twice the price.  I was so stuffed after the eggrolls and half the tofu that I saved the rest for leftovers for my next day's lunch (it was still amazing reheated).  The Pho is just as good as everyone says, the Chicken Egg Foo Yong is probably my favorite and all of the lunch specials are incredible for $6 - $7.    Based on the quality of the food, the affordable prices (lunch is even cheaper if you can believe it) and the kind service from Maggie I give Maxim a solid 5-star review.  Maxim has become one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix and I think everyone should give it a try.

I've eaten at Orange Table somewhere around 50 or 60 times over the last few years and I can tell you that they consistently provides 4-5 star quality food which I absolutely love.  The "monkey pancakes" with bananas and sliced almonds are one of my favorite breakfasts anywhere with nuts and maple syrup, the chipotle chicken sandwich is unbelievable, the balsamic mozzarella melt is incredible and the burgers (all of them) are some of the best I've had in town.    Unfortunately, as many other people have mentioned, this amazing food is often but not always delivered with 2-3 star quality service.  This review and the 4 stars are not meant to excuse the poor service but I will tell you that I have never had a bad meal there.  Ever.  Patience is a virtue and a necessary one in this case.  I would give 5 stars on food alone but conversely just can't justify lowering the rating to a 3 based on slow service as many others have done.  My advice - plan on spending some time there, know the deal ahead of time and just be cool.  Your food will come out, perhaps even without a smile but this place is absolutely worth it.

Of the very limited dining options in Gila Bend for travelers, this place is likely the best. Most of the options are fairly typical Mexican fare but the salsa and gorditas are strangely good. I'm not sure what they do to the salsa but it's amazing. The gorditas are like little flash fried Mexican pockets of meat topped with cheese, lettuce and tomatoe. A real treat, compared to the many other sub-par restaurant options nearby. Lots of locals and travelers, generally a good sign. Very fair prices. Service is acceptable. Not one of the cleanest places I've eaten but I'll be going back for more the next time I pass through.

The service, decor and appetizers are always top-notch. Crab claws and mussels are some of my favorites. While the steaks are always good, they leave me wishing I headed to City Hall instead. Factoring in the high prices, the steaks are just not my first choice. If you're into a simpler slab of lightly seasoned beef, however, this may be the place for you.

Ahi tacos, rib tacos and ribs are all good but a little overpriced. Service staff is always top-notch. Both the beer and wine lists are good, mixed and specialty drinks are nicely done.

This place is absolutely fantastic.  The prices are the same as any of the corporate spots, the wait is shorter and everyone is actually nice and helpful.  Forget about the long waits and rude corporate pharmacists people.  Do yourself a favor and stop in to Melrose Pharmacy, support a local business and maybe even check out the drum setup they have for First Friday!  I highly recommend this place!  Theresa the owner is great and super helpful!

Consistently good food, friendly staff and very clean. Food is usually served quickly and I like sitting at the chef's counter to watch them cook everything. Kung pau chicken and Mingolion been with fried or brown rice are great. New options are added occasionally. Good for dine in or takeout.

After 3 experiences, I think I can admit that I am not crazy about St. Francis.  This last meal confirms it and is by far the most telling.  First of all, our server ranted and raved about the cioppino.  When she said she got to enjoy one after "winning a contest" at which point I should have know she was more of a saleswoman than a true guide of the menu.  She ranted and raved about the cheesy bread included in the dish, not exactly a traditional staple of cioppino but I thought I'd give it a try.  It tasted like delicious cheese bread in the middle of Ragu and old seafood.  Good cioppino is rare, but it's not rocket science.  This was easily the worst dish St. Francis has done in my experience and for the price and reputation they try to uphold, this is inexcusable.    Happy hour at St. Francis?  Good.  Pizza?  They use the crust from LGO so it better be decent.  It's a good thing St. Francis has a good location, beautiful building, hipster popularity and great happy hour...  General Phoenix diners will be able to look past the low quality food for those reasons.  True quality food-seekers will look elsewhere.  I'll give you a try again in a few months St. Francis, I hope you can hold on to a few decent cooks and a chef long enough to make some changes.

The food is consistently good, the portions are large and staff are always friendly. The Spicy Chicken and Kung Pow are some of my favorites. I typically prefer hole-in-the-wall Asian spots but this is a safe bet.

This is THE spot in Phoenix for fried fish and shrimp. My two buddies and I each enjoyed orders of two catfish pieces that also came with three shrimp, drinks and one side. we got fried okra, sweet potato tots, collard greens and an extra order of jalapeño hush puppies. The cost was very affordable at about $28 total. It was fantastic! The fish pieces were actually fillets that appeared to be very fresh, lightly dusted with breading and lightly fried. We got the spicy with is more of just some added pepper but it's delicious.   Comparing this to somewhere like Pete's Fish and Chips seems laughable as this is everything Pete's should be but isn't. The breading here is not overstated, everything seems fresh, it's delicious and you get a lot for around $8 per person. I'll definitely be back and I highly recommend Papa Joe's to everyone reading this review!

Great wine and beer selection and you can't beat the $20 bottle and bruschetta deal on Tuesdays after 8pm. Always a solid choice if you can find a table! Get there early!

BACON, people!  Spicy Italian sausages, brats, even heirloom veggies by the pound?  Locally raised hogs and none of the extra chemicals the corporations and grocery stores use?  I have found my personal piggy promised land and it is The Meat Shop.    I headed over here with some buddies after hearing that some local restaurants and patrons have been taking notice of the flavor and quality they offer.  We were quite pleased.  The staff were helpful and knowledgeable about the meats, cuts, and preparation.  We grilled up everything that night - the sausages, the brats, the veggies... even the bacon... because, why not?  I think we spent a grand total of $20 and we still had enough leftovers to throw in with some sunny side up eggs and toast the next morning for breakfast.  This place is fantastic and surprisingly the same cost as most of the stuff you'll find in the grocery store.  I can't wait to head back over for round 2!

Ballo Blanco is fantastic!  Located within the hip Clarendon Hotel near downtown Phoenix, this is one of the best places for brunch / lunch in the $10 - $12 range.  Tacos range from $2 - $3 each with 2-3 composing an adequate amount of food for an entree.  The cochinita (pork) and Ahi (eco-friendly and the current Market Selection) tacos are my favorite but the carne asada is also good if you're in the mood for some beef instead.  The Pico Rico Burger and Naco Torta are also fantastic if you're feeling like a sandwich, the Naco being another one of my favorites.  The coffee is great, the fries are a must for $3 and I while I've yet to order the Chicharron de Queso for an appetizer it looks amazing!    The service might not be 5-stars depending on the day but they can get very busy and at the least they are always nice.  If you haven't already been to the Clarendon Hotel itself it's very cool and has a beautiful pool that's open to the public on certain days as well!

Why oh why, Two Hippies Breakfast, must you refuse to be the awesome restaurant I had hoped for?  I can walk to you after multiple visits I am unable to force myself to visit you again...  You have a very large menu but have chosen quantity over quality.  I have eaten your burgers, sandwiches, eggs and biscuits and gravy and all of them were incredibly mediocre.  Nothing stood out, everything seemed to take too long to prepare and about 50% of the time at least one thing was wrong with the order.  Often not everything is as hot as it should be, once there were soggy and undercooked fries and another time I was given an overcooked burger.  I also can't believe that "Two Hippies" like you would decided to use the amount of old school styrofoam for plates that is in turn dumped into our landfills... how about washable dishes, recycled paper plates or something along those lines?  Stop by a restaurant like Green or Pita Jungle, Two Hippies and take note - of their dishware as well as the quality of their food.

This restaurant's tough-to-spot location in a strip mall has to be the reason this great little find hasn't been reviewed yet.  In short, this place is amazing!!!  They have about 10 different $5 combos - pitas, gyro, chicken souvlaki, falafel, etc. and that also comes with fries and a soda or bottled water.  These prices are all day, not just for lunch.  If you're not that hungry, a regular gyro pita is $3 by itself or you can do double meat for $2 more.  Quality is not compromised for price here, this is as good or better than any other gyro you will find in the Valley.  I also highly recommend asking for a side of the hot sauce, it's not too spicy and has a really nice flavor.    The owner Tom is a really nice guy and he'll probably ask how you heard about his place and seems like the kind of owner who will try to remember you the next time you're in.  I highly recommend checking this place out!

Tacos Atoyak's fish tacos are the best in Phoenix! I've been going here since they opened and I still have dreams about these fish tacos, tostadas, el pastor anything and their multiple styles of quesadillas.  The not-so-expensive area of town and not-so-expensive decor provide the customers with the benefit of very inexpensive yet extremely delicious food.  They could easily charge more for what you get!  Dan, aka Big Mike, you are doing things right, sir!

In short, Windsor is everything I wanted from St. Francis and didn't get, offered at a fraction of the  price.  The Reuben is magical.  The Salmon Ceasar is great.  The fries and mac & cheese... yum.  The $5 happy hour pitchers of solid, amazing beers...  forget about it.  Cool, friendly staff who care and make good recommendations, you say?  Managers like Tory who care enough to stop by, say hello and get excited when you say how good everything is?  This restaurant gives Postino a run for its money and puts places like St. Francis (on the high-end) and Main Ingredient (on the low-end) to shame.  $10 - $12 for this caliber of food in Phoenix is both refreshing and rare, unfortunately.  Thank you for being a breath of fresh and amazing air, Windsor.  It's been a long time since I was this pleasantly surprised by a Phoenix restaurant.  NOCA, you will always be the best for dinner but Windsor is my new favorite spot for lunch or less expensive dinner!!!

Since they dropped the bean salad and scallops as well as decreased the sizes of the sandwiches, I've had to drop my review from 5 to 4 stars. Still good food and atmosphere but not as great as the first year it was open. They must have had a kitchen manager change towards the end of last year as that's when these changes took place and the food dropped in quality.

Made-from-scratch beef pies and pork pies are amazing! The dumplings and garlic eggplant with pork were also very good. The noodle dishes were okay but are not the main attraction. Food prices are very affordable. This place is great to head to with a group of 3-4 so you can all try a little of everything. The orders of 3 pies can be increased to orders of 4, just don't be afraid to ask if desired. Service typically leaves something to be desired but you're there for the food. It's worth driving out of your way to head here. I've been here twice and will be back again soon.

This is one of the fastest Chipotles I've ever been to... And they better be, given how long the lunch line can get! Great food as all Chipotles put out for a reasonable price. Since they added the brown rice bowl it's quickly become my favorite for both flavor and the fact that it's healthier than white rice or a tortilla. Yum!

I relocated from Phoenix to Tempe almost two years ago and D'Lish/D'Lite quickly became my coffee spot away from home. Consistently the most friendly staff who remembered my name and some of the best coffee I've had in the Valley. Usually I would just drink cold coffee black but sometimes I would go with the Breakfast Buzz for a change and absolutely loved it! The food is also 'd'lish'. My favorite is the toast with sausage, egg and hashbrowns with chipotle aioli.   Thank you especially to Shelby and Leonard for always being so cool and willing to chat when they're not incredibly busy.  Note, they are a popular spot and can get busy on Saturday mornings. There is additional parking down the side street. Great place to work during the week and people watch on the weekends. Ideal for coffee, food and conversation.

Terrible food and drinks. Cool restaurant layout. Service staff and managers were attentive.   It was packed for First Friday, which was opening night. Bad decision. The manager who stopped by admitted he had not yet tasted the food or drinks. One more indicator of why everything was so poorly executed.  The craft beer selection is unfamiliar but mediocre. The mixed drinks were all made in batches, according to staff, and tasted watered down. All were terrible.                                                           The appetizer menu has 3 chips & dip options including salsa, guacamole and queso. The chips were chewy, as if they were either not cooked enough or they were stale. The salsa, queso and guacamole were all lacking in flavor. The queso looked and tasted like potato soup.  They have 5 tacos on the menu. The carne asada and carnitas were very dry and flavorless. Temperature was between luke warm and cold. The cactus was unique, had a mild grilled flavor but was only so-so. The calamari tasted overly breaded and overly fried. The chicken was flavorless, as if frozen chicken had been reheated and some sauce had been thrown over it at the last minute.  Service staff and managers seemed to care, visited us on many occasions and ultimately comped our meal. They asked us to come back and we will. I will gladly update this review if food quality improves. I hope it does.
