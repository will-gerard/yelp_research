I would give 10 stars if it were possible.  I would like to start this review by stating that I did not, in any way, want to be at this hospital.  My original birth plan was to be a a fancier hospital in North Scottsdale because of their reputation.  I had been to Banner Desert a couple of times to visit friends who had given birth and I was never impressed.  I was admitted to the hospital by a high risk OBGYN due to high blood pressure and possible pre-eclampsia.  I went in with the thought that I would be in for 48 hours of observation and then on my way out to enjoy bed rest in the comfort of my own home.  Well, I ended up staying for 5 weeks.  During this time, I was taken care of in their Antepartum unit.  The nurses and aides were amazing.  They were kind, compassionate and treated me like family rather than just another patient.  They were not only accomodating to me but my husband who stayed the night several times per week.    After 5 weeks it was time to have my baby delivered.  I couldn't deliver naturally so the doctors took me in for an emergency c-section.  I was so terrified and as the surgery began, I was alone in the operating room with only surgery techs and the anesthesiologist.  I told one of the techs how scared I was and she held my hand while I received my spinal and talked to me the whole time which kept me calmed down.  As terrifying as the experience could have been, everyone in the OR was wonderful.  My baby has been in the NICU for 4 weeks now and has not been all smooth sailing.  My baby got NEC, a very serious intestinal disease, but was caught early and resolved because of fast acting nurses and doctors.  And while I'd much rather have my daughter home with me, I feel very comfortable knowing she is in the wonderful hands of the NICU team.  After this experience, I would never want to be at any other hospital.

We visited this urgent care about a month ago and I'm surprised that it's taken me this long to write a review for them...  The reason for our visit was because our baby had some kind of bug and had been throwing up for about a week.  Our regular pediatrician didn't make it out to be a big deal but after a few days and 2 ped's visits, we wanted a second opinion.  We visit this place specifically due to our daughter being a preemie and my husband and I being very wary of "regular" urgent cares.    The wait was about normal for an urgent care that didn't seem busy in the waiting room.  When we were called back, the nurse took the usual vitals and asked a lot of questions about why we were there; she seemed different than other nurses we'd seen, caring and actually helpful.  It wasn't long before the Dr. came in and sat down with us.  He checked out my daughter and told us exactly what we already knew.  He did do something different that other doctors hadn't done, he noticed that she was healing from an ear infection, as well, and explained them to us.  He pulled out his phone that had a diagram of the interior of an ear and helped us understand why she had gotten it and how to prevent them in the future.  We truly appreciated the time and care he put into our visit and will only go back to this urgent care when needed.  The trip was only $50 and seemed very reasonable to us.

So, I'm new to gun ranges and shooting guns in general.  I took my husband here for "date day" as he loves to shoot guns and hasn't done so since he got his CCW.  We went on a Sunday and it was mildly busy but we got in right away, yay...  I was more nervous than excited.  We rented the girliest gun they had, a .22 Revolver.  The range is small but I find it very comfortable.  The people who work there are nice and were helpful when we needed it.    As far as price goes, I'm not sure what is over priced and what's not.  We paid $60 for a lane for 2 people, gun rental, ammo, ear and eye protection for both of us and 4 targets.  2 of the targets were the new zombie splatter, which my husband found to be "awesome".  I would recommend this place to anyone, new or experienced.

I've been known to not be adventerous with food but in the last few years I've really tried to step out of my comfort zone.  The Mixed Grill was my first out of my box experience.  It's a hot sandwich, never would have but glad I did, that consists of ham, turkey, swiss, cheddar, carmelized onions, dill pickle and honey mustard.  Holy delicious.  It's a mess but so worth it.  Make sure you bring a wet nap because it can get sticky.  My second out of box experience was with their Potato Cream Cheese soup.  I have never been a fan of "creamy" soups but tried this as I was urged by a coworker- I haven't been the same since.  This soup has some sort of magical power that makes me forget that I never liked creamy soups.  Again, not sure whats in it, besides the obvious, but its perfect.  In addition to the food, the customer service is good too.  I've never had a visit that I've wished I hadn't made.  Now, I'm hungry...

Love, love, love Liberty Market. I've only been here a couple of times but it's been awesome each time. The service is great and so is the food. I recommend the Italia sandwich.  This place is always busy and is a testiment to their product.  Go. Eat. Enjoy.

Love, love, love their buffalo grilled wings and buffalo chicken strips.  The only other thing I've had was the pizza and it was, eh, okay.  They do have a great happy hour, if you like margaritas.    Service is good.

Jodi is amazing.   My bouquet was everything that I wanted, and more, and my bridesmaids were awesome too.   In addition to bouquets and boutonnieres, she made seat placements for my mom, grandma, my husbands grandma, grandpa and ta ta as they were ill or had passed away and were, obviously, unable to attend our wedding. It was a very kind suggestion.   My centerpieces were massive and were heavenly.  I can't express my gratitude enough for the beautiful flowers!!

I was here for a meeting and pretty much love this place.    The decor is simple and comfortable.  There are pieces of art on the walls that are for sale and were really cool.  A friend of mine stated that she thought they switched them out on a regular basis.  Our service was good.  We started with coffee's and water but didn't order any food for a couple of hours.  During this time, my glass was filled up several times and our server asked us on several occasions if there was anything else that she could get for us.  In addition to our server, we were greeted several times by other employees.  We ordered lunch but their menu also offers breakfast.  This was tough for me because I heart breakfast.  So, the tough decision was breakfast or lunch.  So I decide lunch.  So then what?  Do I have the american grilled cheese?  Or fresh mozzarella salad?  Or chicken sandwich?  I decide on the proscuitto and mozzarella salad with balsamic vinegarette.  Amazing.  I stopped short of licking the plate clean.  I might have if I wasn't sitting with a group of people.  I can't wait to visit for breakfast!

UPDATE!  This place is still amazing.    My husband and I stopped in for breakfast and I actually had the breakfast.  1.  The pancakes were delicious, I mean, seriously decious.  2. The bacon.  Oh man, the bacon...Fantastic.  It was the best bacon I've ever had in my life.  Really, my life.  How's this possible?  Actually, I don't want to know, I just want more bacon  My husband has the chimichurri, steak and eggs.  He loved it.  I loved it, too.  I had to try it and I'm glad I did.    I could kill for another pancake and some bacon.

I just stayed here over the past weekend and had a great experience.  My husband and I were celebrating out 1 year anniversary and had received a night stay as a gift from a friend.  She had told us what type of room we should be expecting and gave us a confimation #.  Upon arriving, I valeted my car because I had so many things to carry but didn't know about the $29 over night charge :(.  This was my only bad experience.  I went to check in and was told that we were receiving a complimentary upgrade, maybe because it was our anniversary?!  Awesome.  Our room was beautiful.  It had a great view of the pools, courtyard and Tempe/Phoenix.    We went to dinner at J&G Steakhouse.  The service was good, not great, but good.  I liked the dim atmosphere and the gorgeous view.  Our food was good, too.  Again, not great, but good.  I should have ordered the Filet.  They had a very large selection of wine, liquor and beer.  I had asked, when making the reservation, if I could bring our wedding cake to have as desert and was told that they don't normally do it but would for a cake cutting charge- no thanks.  Our server did ask us if we wanted desert and said we should since we were celebrating our anniversary- they remembered!  Dinner was good, overall.  We had a great room, good dinner and would go back again....and get the Filet.

This is very simple, no back story needed...  Bar service- AWFUL.  My friends and I were treated so rudely by not 1 but 3 bartenders.    It was so bad, I wish they could get negative stars.  Food- AMAZING.  The best pizza in Arizona.    Terrible service= terrible review.  The Gilbert location is 1,000 times better.

I have been a fan of Four Peaks for several years.  Before I became a beer drinker, I would come with friends and have their peach ale.  It was perfect in the summertime and perfect for that person who doesn't really like beer.  As I've grown up and my taste for beer has matured, I've really come to like almost all of their beers.  My favorite is the pumkin porter.  My heart crys a little tear when I remember that I can only get it once a year.  I have to remember to stock up, next time.  I do enjoy their food and the french fries are bomb.  I have recently had their hummus and its pretty delicious, too.  The best time to visit is during the day time, beat the dinner rush.

I may have just been the luckiest woman in the world to have the best wedding vendors- ever.  Arizona Inspirations Catering was no exception.  This for me was my first and only stop for food.  My husband and I are foodies and so this was a very important part of our wedding.    We had 2 tastings, and they were awesome, but were invited to as many as we wanted to attend.  The food we tried was great and the food at the wedding was better.  Nik and his chef made my day.  I'm searching for another reason to have them cater.

My husband and I had finally decided that after 3 1/2 years in our new home that we needed to invest in blinds.  A friend of ours had recently purchased blinds for his new home and due to his strong opinion on lots of thigs, I thought he would be the best consultant for this.  When asking if he liked his blinds and if he was happy with the service he received, he couldn't say enough about how wonderful TCW is.  So, I decided that I would give 'em a shot.  I found a web coupon for a great discount and scheduled our appointment.  Someone was out within a couple of days to measure and give an estimate.  He gave us lots of options and helped us pick what was going to be the best for our family.  We ended up ordering 2" faux wood blinds with the tight close and upgraded valance.  It took about 2 weeks for them to be made and they were installed in the blink of an eye.  I think all 13 windows took an hour for installation and he did such a great job.    We are very happy with the quality of the faux wood, the time it took to complete and install as well as the customer service we received.  We would recommend TCW a million times.  I am sorry for not knowing the name of the people that helped us but are very thankful for the help they gave us.

This is probably my most favorite of all Vegas clubs.  The ride to the club is beautiful if you like that whole, glass elevator, see for miles thing.  Once inside you're greeted by a very dim lit room and the sound of music in the distance.  Walk a few more feet and you're at, most importantly, a huge bar with extremely friendly bartenders.  Once you grad you're drink you have to head outside where the view is breath taking.    Besides getting in for free, the drinks are good and if you're celebrating something special, the bartenders hook it up.  I would go back a million times.

I love FEZ!    I have had great food and drinks whether it's been in the evening for dinner and drinks or on Sunday for brunch.  My favorite is their brunch; my biggest problem is trying to decide exactly which item I want to get.  Between my friends, husband and myself, we've had everything on the menu and it's all good and consistently so.  Another plus?  They have really amazing specials.

So, I have to be honest and say that I wasn't exactly stoked to eat at this place.  It shares a building with an automotive supply store and I thought for sure that I'd be losing my dinner faster than I ate it.  My husband suggested it because our usual spot had closed down and I was craving sushi.  "Let's go to Sushi Ave" was a phrase I was positive that I would regret...  SURPRISE!  This place is great.  The first time we went we had amazing service and the food was good.  The second time we went, the service was amazing and the food was delicious.  I think that my only gripe would be that the rolls are huge and I had to google the appropriate way to eat large pieces; it's all or nothing, btw.  My favorite treat was at the end of the meal when they brought 1/2 an orange drizzled with chocolate and whipped cream.  Ugh, I'm hungry again...  Sushi Ave is our new fav sushi place and I am so happy about that.

I am a huge fan of another pizza joint that will remain nameless.  I have raved about how they have the best pizza I've ever had and was pretty sure that I'd never find another pizza that was as good.  Well, they've got stiff competition.  Spinato's has the best pizza I've ever had.  My husband is going to be so mad at me for that statement.    I've had the pleasure of eating the thin and thicker crust, both are good, but the thin is the best.    I'm a lucky gal to have them right across the street from my office...

I really like this place but wish it didn't close at 2 pm- I'm not always good about taking my lunch at a reasonable time.  I've had several sandwiches and wraps as well as their ceasar salad and I've been satisfied each time.  The service is usually very friendly.

Love this place. The entire staff is so friendly and sweet to my dog. She gets anxiety very easily and they do everything they can to make her stay fun and as enjoyable as possible. I also love that she can be groomed before I pick her up so she comes home smelling good.  I love reading her report card and finding out how she did during play times.   I have to give Pete and Mac's a huge thank you for caring for my dog like it was their own.

I had previously written a review for Pete & Mac's on another page, I suppose it wasn't the "official" page.  I originally gave them 5 stars because they treat my dog so well and they are always super friendly.  I have revised my review just a bit to accommodate a recent happening.  Love Pete & Mac's for their genuine love for dogs and the ability to make my dog forget about her anxiety for a minute.  My dog is getting better about staying and I think it has to do with the people that work for this place.    As I previously stated, I had given them 5 stars but after this last stay, I'm sad to say, they only get 4.  This 1 star deduction is for the front office staff at pick up.  They were rude.  Period.  I am big on customer service and feel like they could have been, um, warmer??  I know it's a Sunday but c'mon.  Now, the staff that was there when I dropped her off was very friendly and very helpful.    I will continue to board my dog here because I know she is in good hands but will keep my fingers crossed that I don't have to encounter the same 2 unfriendly women I did previously.

I don't know how to really rate a vitamin store but I'll give 5 stars because the gentleman that helped me was kind and patient.  I'll go back because of my great experience with his customer service.

I am so happy that this place is in my neighborhood!  My husband and I get take out from here a couple of times a month and it's consistently delicious each time.  AND, the staff is super friendly, which I'm a huge fan of.  We always get their dinners that come with soup, rice, spring roll and entree.  If you ask nicely, they will substitute a spring roll for the soup.  It makes me happy :)

The food is really good! My husband and I frequent The Coffee Shop for breakfast and cupcakes. I wouldn't say the breakfast and cupcakes are amazing but they're really good and worth the money. If you want to stop by for breakfast on the weekends come early; I'm not the only one that thinks the food is good and is apparent by the lack of seating. Another reason I love this place is because it's comfortable to come with a group of friends/family or by yourself. My favorite place to sit is out back in the "garden" area, especially during cool weather.   My only complaint is that the service isn't good. I feel like I'm inconveniencing the staff by placing an order; they are very short and seem preoccupied with whatever else.   Go in knowing that you're going to get good food but mediocre service and you won't be disappointed.

I'm usually a big fan of dive bars but wasn't impressed, at all.  One of the kegs was empty so my friends didn't get their "favorite" beer, not a huge deal but not a good thing for 5pm on a Friday.  The servers seemed really overwhelmed and was probably due to the fact that there were only 4 for the entire place and it was really busy.  On a very positive note, my friends said that the food was really good for bar food.  This might be a great place for any day and time other than happy hour on a Friday.

I'm only assuming that this is as good as it gets as I've only been married once but was AMAZING.   This venue is the most unique, beautiful and amazing (can I say it again??!!) venue that my husband and I viewed. Well, technically it was the first and only venue we looked at. It was exactly what we were looking for in terms of cost and size; it doesn't hurt that it had the "us" factor. You know, you walk into a place and you think to yourself, "self, this is so me". Well, that's what Inspirador was to us.   The bridal party and I showed up quite a bit earlier than I had said that we would be there and I think we caught them off guard. Instead of asking us to come at a later time, they totally accommodated us and tried to cool everything down as fast as possible. The bridal suite was spacious- at one point, I'm pretty sure we had just over 10 people in there getting ready, taking pictures and just being there to support me. They have a no outside alcohol rule, that I was pretty sure was going to ruin my day (in bridezilla fashion), but they were so kind and brought us Sofia champagne. It was perfect.   We had our ceremony inside, and it was breathtaking. We had just under 100 guests and they fit very comfortably. The votives on the wall were gorgeous.   The reception area was huge and left plenty of room for lots of tables but for lots o dancing as well.   My overall experience was great. They were very helpful and on it the days before and the day of.   I wish I could get married again...

This was my very first visit to the Scottsdale Saddle Ranch but have been to the LA location a couple of times.  I was never really impressed with the food, or service for that matter, and assumed my over payment was for the location.  But, this review isn't about their LA location so back to business...  A few friends and I went for happy hour on Friday around 6:30 pm.  They weren't too busy and we were all able to get seats at the bar.  Our bartender was great, in fact I'm pretty sure I told her I loved her.  The service was fast and the food was actually good.  We started with the sweet potato fries.  Holy f-bombs, they were amazing.  They came with 2 dipping sauces, a spicy ketsup and a cinnamon frosting somthing or other.  I'm not sure we spoke too many words during this time, just shoveling, and watching the other to see if they were going to take the last few- greedy.  We also had the nachos.  Not as good as the fries but were so very good.  One of my friends asked if he could hold the plate while we finished eating all of the stuck on cheese.  Yes, please!  These were huge so plan on sharing.  The last thing we had was the cotton candy.  For not liking cotton candy, I sure had a lot of it.  It was good but after a bit, and I'm sure due to the warm weather, started to get a little funky.    We did also consume adult beverages.  I had beer and it was, well, beer.    Overall, this place was good and yes, I am a fan.  I'm not sure I would go during rush hours.  Oh, make sure you ride the bull.  My friends had a blast.

I have been going to Alex since April of 07 and every cut I have had is awesome!  My hair always looks great the day I walk out and even when return for a trim/cut- which isn't always the normal 6-8 weeks.  The color she uses is great too and lasts through so many washes.  I thoroughly enjoy getting my hair done by Alex, would recommend her all day and regreted going to someone else while she was on maternity leave; I should have just waited :)

They will always have a 5 in my book.  My mom and I have been taking our animals to UAH since 2004.  We have had some great experiences and some not so good but it all equals to 5 because they have saved my animals lives.  The front desk staff is...a little rude at times.  I've walked in and stood at the counter many times for a few minutes before anyone even looked up at me or said we'll be with you in a minute.  The check out staff is usually more friendly.  But, the experiences I've had make the front desk staff nil.  My mom had a cat that was run over by a car.  When she was taken to the emergency vet, they told us it didn't look so good for her.  It was very sad as she was my mom's "baby".  They told us to give UAH a try and see if they could help her with surgery.  They had to amputate her leg but she is alive and I'm pretty sure she doesn't know it's gone.  We had a dog with valley fever, and had been suffering from the disease for a few years.  We were constantly at the vet to get blood work done so that we could reoder medicine and they always helped us out and made sure we could get in when we needed.  My dog was in to be boarded and while she was there, I was going to get her teeth cleaned.  Because she was an older dog, they told me that I needed to have blood work done to make sure all of her organs were working correctly in order to put her under.  I'm on vacation and receive a call from the surgeon, Dr. Koch, to let me know that there seemed to be something wrong with her liver.  I went into panic mode and started crying instantly.  He was very kind and told me that this happens and we needed to try a vitamin before looking at liver disease.  Home from the vet and straight to the vitamin store to pick up what we needed, 2 weeks later and she's fine.  He was right.  He called me several times to follow up on her.  I can appreciate anyone who cares, genuinely.  He does.  Most recently,  I took my dog in because I found a very large lump on her thyroid area.  I was panicked and a worried mom, but Dr. Cortez helped calm me down.  She was very calm and reasonable.  She explained that there might be an explanation, other than cancer, and we would probably be fine.  She was right.  She was very caring and even followed up with me via phone.  I moved 40 minutes away but will continue to make the drive to Tempe to take my animals here.

I've been going back and forth as to how many stars this place should get.  I finally decided on 2 because I can't award 1/2 a star and feel 3 stars is too many.  My friends and I visited on a Saturday afternoon.  We entered and asked if we could sit in the bar area but we wouldn't be able to sit at the bar because there were too many of us.  The hostess was very short and said she would get something for us and be right back, then, she disappeared.  When she came back she led us to the furthest table from the bar.  Not what we wanted or asked for.  We decided we were going to ask for a table at the bar and was informed that outside was open seating- this would've helped when we asked the first time but, whatever.  Our server was not the sunniest bulb in the box, meaning, she was not friendly.  Gosh, I hate that and it put me in a bad mood.  Last time I checked, she was there to help us at her own will, not against it.  Geesh.  We all had a couple drinks and some of us had appetizers.  They were good but nothing to write home about.  Bar food.  My favorite part of the evening was when my friends rode the bull.  It was entertaining.  So, in closing, go to ride the bull and then get the hell out of there.  Well, maybe stop at the bar and grab a drink first.

I love this place because of their lunch BBQ.  It's amazing.  You can get a healthy lunch, or not if you choose, for a reasonable price and it's all grilled to order.  TO ORDER!  You want salmon, you can have salmon- and it's awesome!  My other favorite is their turkey burger.  It's made with too many delicious things, including red peppers.  In addition to the "entree" you get 2 sides.  I would recommend the mac 'n cheese and macaroni salad- carbs and carbs, yum!  This is not an in and out type of place so you'll want to give them 10 minutes to make your meal, or more if it's busy.  Go inside and grab a large iced tea of any flavor, they're all good!  The only down side is that they're only open until 3 pm.

I have to say, Wildflower has been consistently awesome each time I've visited.  This also covers all of their locations as well.  I know that no matter which one I go to, the food is going to be delicious and the service is going to be good as well.

Amazing!   I have been talking about getting a bikini wax for years but never did because I was too afraid that the pain would be so bad I would want to die. I had mentioned it to a co-worker and she said that I should try Bliss for my first time; she had mentioned that it was the least painful waxing she had ever had. Super nervous and only 5 days from my beachy honeymoon I decided that it was now or never; I booked my appointment, and one more for a friend (if I was going to be in pain, someone else would be too).   It was the week of my wedding and was out running last minute errands the morning of my appointment, I had lost track of time and realized that I was now running late. I was very worried that I was going to lose my appointment and pay for it, you leave a credit/debit card when you book your appointment in case you don't show or cancel after the approved time frame, but was very relieved when the woman on the phone said she would just push it back 30 minutes.   We showed up at the spa, which is very easy to find, and was immediately greeted by a very friendly woman behind the front desk. She informed us that it would be just a moment before we would be taken back. 1 minute later we were escorted back to the waiting area by an even friendlier woman who asked about our service and tried to reassure us that it was the least painful waxes she has ever had. We waited anxiously before Keri called me to the room of doom where I was positive that I was going to have my skin peeled off all in the name of vanity. We stepped into the room where she informed me that I would be removing the clothing on my lower half and replacing it with a pair of sanitary underwear. Keri talked me through the whole process before starting and tried to ease my anxiety by telling me that it, again, was the least painful wax. She asked me which of the three services I had decided to get, you get your choice of how much you'd like them to take off, and I let her know that I would be getting the "inbetweeny". She reassured me that I had made a great choice for my first ever waxing experience and wouldn't be disappointed or want to die.   The whole experience from removing of clothes to putting them back on lasted all of 30 minutes and.....drum roll please....was actually tolerable! The pain, I would rate a 5-7 out of 10, really wasn't that bad! Keri made it very comfortable and, dare I say it, almost pain free! The worst part of it all was the waiting and anxiety.   I would, hands down, recommend this spa to anyone and everyone. The experience from start to finish was great.

The service here is always great.  My husband and I prefer to sit at the bar and don't have any complaints.  Get the pizza, with anything on it, you're bound to be a happy camper.  I also recommend the anitpasta- yum :)  What I don't recommend is arriving between 4 pm-5pm as they are stocking the oven and there's no pizza magic happening then.  Food = awesomely amazing. Service= awesomely amazing.  We had Nikki last night, and she's great.

Hot dogs? Yes, please. I recommend the works, delicious. I also got the cheese fries, meh. I only wish the cheese was a real nacho cheese with a little flavor rather than a regular cheddar. This is a great lunch spot but definitely get it to go since all the seating is outside. Also, make sure you get there early because they close at 5:30 and are not open on Sundays.

Love, love, love, love infinity.  When planning our wedding my husband and I searched for the perfect gift for our guests and cringed at the thought of giving away another shot glass or salt and pepper shaker.  While at a bridal expo I picked up a flyer for another photo company and thought it was a good idea.  I mentioned to my wedding venue the photo booth idea and they recommended SnapBooth and I decided to give them a call.  After speaking with Mike I decided that SnapBooth was the perfect and unique gift.  My guests loved it!  I'm pretty sure that my guests spent more time taking pictures than dancing or socializing.    My favorite part was, well I had 2.  The first favorite was the guest book.  My guests got to take their pictures, keep one half and then put the second half in a book and write a note especially for my husband and myself.  It was great waking up the morning after our wedding and looking through all of the hilarious pictures and reading the sweet words our friends and family had written us.  My second favorite part was the cd with all of the pictures that were taken- some to never be seen again!!  After my wedding, I recommended SnapBooth to my boss and we used them at our holiday party.  Again, everyone had a blast!  A huge thanks to Mike for all of the awesome memories that he supplied us with that night.

I really like this location.  I manage an apartment community and offer donuts and coffee to residents leaving for work, early in the morning.  I always call in my orders the day before and let them know what time I will be in to pick up my order as I have to drive to Tempe and get set up by 7:30 am.  I have used 2 other locations, 3 times and each time I waited.  And waited.  And waited.  After waiting an additional 20 minutes for my order to be completed, 10 minutes before I had to be at work and ready to go, I decided the locations I had tried were done.  I found this location, close to my house, and decided I had nothing to lose based on past experience.  While the people who have taken my order the last two times did have me repeat it, it was no problem.  I showed up when I said I was and my things were ready to go, in bags, and waiting for ME.  Hallelujah.  I'll continue to use this location for my to go orders and probably grab a donut for myself on the way out.

...and the 1 star is being super kind.    My husband and I walked into the restaurant around 8:30 pm and was seated by a hostess that never made eye contact with us.  Never.  Then we were helped by a server that, and I'm almost positive, hates her job and doesn't want to be there.  Again, no eye contact but whatever.  We started off with the mozzarella- horrible.  It came out still dripping in grease and the taste was of old cooking oil.  I had the fettuccini and it was terrible.  I've had better out of a jar at home.  Our bill was stupid for the amount of crappy food that we had.  I usually feel bad saying terrible things about a joint but not in this case.  They should just shut it down.  I am confident in my next statement- I will never, in my life, eat at this place even if it's between life and death.  I'd much rather die.  On the plus side, the water was cold.

I have never had any issues with this location and have appreciated the quick and friendly service.  On our most recent visit, we decided that we were going to sit at the bar as we were not going to be ordering an entire meal of food.  We were greeted promptly and our drink order was taken in which our beers were delivered within a minute or so.  We decided that we were going to order the Kookabora(sp?) Wings and the Grilled Shrimp.  While we were waiting we were given their loaf of bread.  I have a love hate relationship with this bread, i.e. I love it and it hates my thighs.  I was surprised as we weren't ordering entrees but hey, I'll take it because it's delicious.  Our wings and shrimp came out together and they were hot.  The wings are, without fail, hot enough to cause 2nd degree burns but they are amazing.  I love their wings because they aren't the typical hot wing but are a flavorful wing and have the right amount of spice.  I really enjoyed the shrimp as well, it was cooked well and the texture was perfect.  Overall, it was a good meal and seems to be the trend at this Outback location.  I, as well as my husband, came out a very full and happy camper.

My husband and I just signed up for our membership on Sunday and have had a great experience so far.  The gentleman who signed us up seemed a little nervous but was very personable.  On our second day the gentleman at the front desk greeted me by name, I'm big into customer service and this made me happy.  The equipment is new and works well.  There is so much cardio equipment it's hard to choose what to do.  My new favorite is this eliptical/treadmill/stair stepper hybrid thing.  The weight equipment is nice and there is a great selection and not a lot of waiting for something to free up.  So far, so good.  We signed an 18 month agreement and hope the rest of our time there is just as enjoyable as the first 3 days.

I was not the person that ran out and got their nails done every two weeks, I was happy to do it on my own, but I am a new person!  My first experience was a little rough because of the language barrier but my second visit was great.  I happened to get the same woman that I had the first time and she did such a good job.  I'm not sure I'd get the hot stone pedicure but the rest was great.  I have lucked out on the times I've gone because they have been quiet and I got in and out quickly.

I have honestly had nothing but exceptional service each time I've visited this branch.  Not one person has ever come across as too busy or put out by me, even when I came in with a deposit AT 6:00pm.  I know it is extremely rude to do this and I apologized up and down and if they were bothered, they never once let it be known.  I visit this branch on a pretty regular basis due to the location of my office and the necessity for making almost daily deposits and can say they are THE best.  I have used several locations and have been very happy with each one but this one takes the cake.

I have been here several times with friends, usually for happy hour, and I have been satisfied each time.  The drinks are good and the food is really good- I recommend the sweet potato tots, awesome.    My last trip was for brunch to try their $15 bottomless mimosas as advertised on their little a-frame.  When we ordered we are informed that in order to get the bottomless drinks, we would have to order breakfast- perf!  We were there for the food too.  So, besides having to order food, there is no catch.  The only problem, you can't get any refills after 2pm.    My recommendation, go early and hungry then enjoy the constant flow of oj and champagne.

I'm a huge fan of the food but make sure you get it delivered, as long as you're in their area.  I've only gone to the store 1 time and that will never happen again.  It was loud and the space was a little small for all the bodies they had in there.

I'm a big fan of this location.  They always have the best fruit and vegetables.  I have gotten 4 pints of strawberries in the last 2 weeks and they have all been great; nothing moldy or icky.    The meat counter is quality.  I appreciate the honest help of the people behind the counter.  My husband and I were told to try the swordfish and it was just as great as they gentleman said it would be.  If you want to shop in peace, go on Sunday night at 9pm.  It's super quiet.

I wish I had the ability to give 10 stars. April did the cake for my wedding last year and killed it, in a good way. We had 2 different flavors, banana and lemon, and they were both delicious. We chose a simple design, 3 tiers with fondant ribbons on each layer. She hand piped each dot and swirl perfectly.   I just ordered the top of our cake for our anniversary and know it's going to be just as beautiful as the first one.   Now I'm looking for the next reason to order another cake.

I was a lot like the other reviewers here, so excited for a non chain restaurant with good food.  Well, I was sorely mistaken.  My husband and I tried The Spot for the first time and while the food wasn't terrible, it was slightly disappointing.  I had the sliders and while the Hawaiian Sweet rolls they came on were soft, it didn't make sense and the flavor wasn't good.    We decided that we were going to give them another shot as everyone has their "bad days".  This was the worst food I've had in a long time.  I got The Original Spot chicken sandwich- who ever cooked this sandwich has to be afraid of under cooking chicken because it was cooked to shit.  I have never had chicken so burnt and over cooked in my life, seriously.  My husband ordered the Chipotle Chicken sandwich and his chicken was also so extremely over cooked.  I've never seen my husband not want to eat something, as he is a guy and we all know guys don't have taste buds, but he passed on his food.  Seriously.  Unfortunately, we will not be visiting The Spot again.  It's too bad, Gilbert truly needs great local restaurants.  It looks like we'll be exclusively visiting The Coffee Shop.

I'm a huge fan of this joint.  The wine and the food is really good.  I've recently become more adventurous with my food and this has really come in handy when trying their bruschetta.  I've tried almost all of them and they are all pretty good.  I haven't been for their awesome happy hour on Monday's and Tuesday's but it sounds amazing!

The start of my experience here was not so good.  I signed up for my membership and provided a card to the employee who said that she didn't think my card had gone through.  I assumed she knew what she was doing and said no problem.  She said that she would keep an eye on it to make sure that it had gone through and if we had an issue, we could work it out.  Well, my card did process the payment...4 times.  Awesome, over $400 was taken out.  I called as soon as I noticed it and spoke to a few different people that said they would pass on my message and have someone call me.  After not hearing from anyone I took care of calling, and calling, myself.  After 3 weeks, it was finally resolved and I got my money back.  I thank God that I didn't have any important pending items that would have been returned for insufficient funds.  The manager did finally call me back and she apologized and offered some upgrades on my account for the inconvenience.  All is good, until I went to check myself in and my account had been deleted.  Oh man, it was not looking so good for this joint.    The beds, all but once, have been clean.  The staff has been friendly, nothing special, but friendly.   I'm stuck for 3 months so I will make the best of it.

I called Parker's yesterday afternoon, probably around 3 pm, requesting a couple of guys and a truck to move some items (a one and two bedroom model full of furniture) from to a garage, on-site.  I was slightly embarrassed to call so late in the day because I needed this stuff moved like yesterday.  Literally.  I had dropped the ball in getting our stuff out and had less than 24 hours to get it all moved- my units were being gutted at 9:30 am.  When Brandon asked me what time I needed someone he stated that he could have the guys out at 8:30 am.  With the promise of donuts and a forever friendship, I was able to squeeze an earlier time frame of 8 am out of him.  I was not disappointed.  Alex and his partner showed up at 10 minutes to 8 am and got right to work.  They got everything out and moved into their new home in 3 hours; they were professional and courteous.  I'm hoping that my position in Property Management can help them with new business in the future- they deserve it and I am absolutely confident with a referral to them.  Thanks, guys, for your hard work and for being so accommodating!!  (I get to keep my job, YAY!!)
