In the land where many of the Thai restaurants simply rotate proteins, carbs and a standard vegetable medley, Wild Thaiger dishes out more authentic versions of traditional Thai specialties.  I'm a huge fan, especially given that it's proof in and of itself that Thai food is more than just a combo plate - it's an explosion of flavors amalgamated into unique and colorful profiles and textures.  It's an adventure.  Wild Thaiger offers some of my favorites that are not to be found at Thai Basil (so mediocre) and Thai Elephant (good but standard) - Dragon's Eggs are a spin on Kanom Jeeb, thai pork and crab dumplings similar to shu mai, graced with a spicy slice of raw jalapeno on top.  Decha Boar celebrates the not often served wild boar in a peppery sauce of basil and telicherry peppercorns.  They understand that pepper can be flavorful in addition to hot, and there's a whole taste profile there just waiting for you to explore.  Best of all, the presentation on the dishes is a work of art - ribbons of carrots and beets as edible garnishes remind you of what a treat it should be to dine out.  If you are looking for standard Thai, without flair or panache, I could see how this might be seen as too expensive.  But for my money, I'd rather blow my tastebuds out of the park with a mindful chef who prepares her curries and sauces with finesse and grace.  Yum to the freakin' yum.

It's about time that I write a review for La Fontanella given that I've become a regular.  And I live in New York City.  That an Italian restaurant nearly across the country would not only win over my stomach but my heart is a major deal given that I come from the world of great Italian cuisine.  That all being said, La Fontanella continues to exceed my expectations and win over everyone that I bring with me to eat their food.  I feel like an insider at this point given that I've eaten there so often that I ended up having my wedding reception there.  But given that the owners are so present and charming in the place day in and day out, you'll feel like a regular on your very first visit.  I've seen the other negative reviews on here and I have to tell you that if you are looking for a run-of-the-mill, inexpensive red-sauce joint, this is not the place for you.  La Fontanella is for gourmands and romantics who are serious about quality ingredients and dishes prepared with a heavy measure of love.  Everything (and I mean every last thing) from pasta to sauces to dessert is made in house, and special dishes are focused on fresh, seasonal ingredients.  Case in point - we begged for the artichokes in August that we enjoyed in March, but the owner wouldn't dare serve them to us out of season.  Not because she wanted to deny us our request, but that she only wanted to serve us the best of the best.  Cutting to the chase, on my first visit we decided to take a tour of the menu and see what would blow us away.  We started with stuffed mushrooms (luscious and savory), artichokes braised in olive oil (garlicky goodness) and the popular suppli (addictive fried rice balls stuffed with oozy mozzarella, served over homemade bolognese).  The appetizers were rich enough to almost make a meal, but we charged forth nonetheless.  We ordered the Seabass Adriatico (hands-down my favorite - moist flaky filet topped with a toothsome dressing of tomatoes and basil), Pork Loin with Fig Compote, simply grilled lamb chops (great with a squeeze of lemon), and Pescatore Diabolo, a fiery assortment of seafood and crushed red pepper over a tangle of fettucine.  Stuffed and happy, we couldn't eat another bite...and yet, we managed dessert - homemade gelato and zuppa inglese.  A night to remember, we lumbered to the car knowing that we had found a new favorite.  On subsequent visits, we found other new favorites, like the sinfully rich Gnocchi with Prosciutto and Peas (aka the night where my friend Dave asked for thirds on the homemade bread and dipping oil) and the homemade grilled sausage skewers (aka the night where my husband asked if I could go back into the kitchen and beg to learn the recipe).    If you are in the neighborhood and are looking for a treat of the most authentically Italian kind, this is the way to go.  From the romantic, candlelit interior, jovial (and often talkative) servers, to the detail placed on quality ingredients, La Fontanella is memorable and instantly lovable.  It is absolutely no surprise that this place has been around since the 80s, and I'm only sad that I hadn't found it sooner!  PS. Know that the place tends to close early - the rush is usually at around 5pm and by 8pm the place is quieting down.  Good to know if you want to beat the throngs (or why it's emptier later at night!)

Food ranges from delicious (elegant and lovely beef carpaccio) to mediocre (bland chicken rollatini and what might as well have been frozen vegetables).  The servers are lovely and attentive, and sort of distract you from the distinctly geriatric feel in the place.  My husband and I felt like the youngest people in the restaurant by at least 40 years.  I have no idea where this best ravioli nomination came from - they are abysmally forgettable.  I am hard-pressed to believe that a better ravioli cannot be found in Phoenix - there are just way too many good culinary adventures in the area to consider these bland, oversauced pillows of flavorless ricotta worth ordering.    Unimpressed by everything, we were bowled over by the bill.  How could a meal so forgettable come out to $150 for the two of us?  Was the wine that expensive? No.  Did we order anything extraordinary? No. Are we going back? You already know the answer...

Ugh, what a waste.  I know that this place is beloved by many, but really and truly this is straight up, flavorless Mexican chain food with some hatch chilies arbitrarily thrown in at times.  It's a total study in mediocrity, from the bland salsa to the weak margaritas.  Tacos, enchiladas, burritos all left me snoozing.  They get a star for their commemorative mugs (hilarious!) and another for their exceptionally wonderful servers (very sweet and attentive) but that's where it ends.  I can't believe this was the place that the President ate at when he came to visit - I'm joining the throngs of people in the valley that swear against this place.  Like Tim Meadows in Dewey Cox "You don't want no part of this!"

Nello's is pretty darn wonderful - more than a strict sauce slicked pie joint in that some of their creations are pushing the culinary envelope.  I've actually Googled some of their specialty toppings at the table to figure out what they are, the cheeses so specific to regions around the world that you'll want to learn more on why they are notable.  Original crust is thick and buttery, yielding heavy toppings and tender strands of mozzarella.  I'm a big fan of the Schriers pepperoni on a margherita pizza, laden with fresh garlic and torn basil.  Salads are hearty and plentiful, with a killer Spinach Salad (crisp bacon, egg, crunchy radishes and grape tomatoes) and White Balsamic Dressing.  Waitstaff at this location are bustling while still managing to be endearing.  Service can get spotty on weekends when the place crowds a bit, but on two separate occasions where mistakes were made, the manager corrected both immediately with not only no charges for the items but still sending the ordered items.  We've actually left with two pizzas in hand - totally unasked for but very appreciated.  I don't really compare the pizza here to other thin-crust pies - it's so specific of a taste, it's almost its own thing.  That all being said, it's such a yummy experience, if you don't pigeonhole the pizza, you are in for a treat.

Does anyone expect a lot from a Chinese buffet?  Should they?  There were excellent ones in Washington DC, so I know they exist.  Should I temper my review with the knowledge that most Chinese buffets are far inferior to this one?  Does that make this place any better?  Sigh, I don't even know where to begin.  The place is not disgusting inside - if you want to call that neat or well-decorated, I don't know if you can.  I don't think I'd go that far.  Servers are fast and attentive with drinks and clearing plates - you have to appreciate their hustle.  The majority of the items on the buffet are absolutely, unequivocally ordinary.  If your mission is to eat as much food as possible for as cheaply as possible, this would be an excellent place to do it.  Seafood is especially fishy and most items seem as if they've had a long-life under the heat lamp.  Mongolian BBQ (which I'm a fan of) is a low-frequented item here, and the veggie selection illustrates this clearly.  There are maybe 5 roughly chopped vegetable choices, a confusing selection of sauces and a couple trays of meat melting in front of you.  Not terribly appetizing and the final product is as lackluster as you'd expect.  The only true deal is the sushi, of which you can eat copious amounts of and have prepared for you fresh and on demand.  It's not exceptionally good quality, but at a place as low ticket as this, it's a welcome addition to see something being made fresh for you.  Would not go back, and the result of reading many of the reviews here leads me to believe that if this is supposed to be the best of the bunch, I might as well give up hope on the concept of the exceptional Chinese buffet in Phoenix altogether.

Incredibly polite and efficient service.  Plus, no wait on a Sunday afternoon, which is the exact opposite of, say, IHOP.  We came for breakfast and were bowled away by how great the service was - the waiter had every possible configuration of questions on how we'd like out food, and even offered salsa as soon as the entrees came out.  I wasn't planning on salsa for my Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs but sure, what the hell.  Well, the salsa was delicious with the perfect amount of kick - I ended up dousing my buttery hashbrowns in it and going to town.  Eggs and chicken fried steak were both tasty and the toast was thick cut and good to sop up the extra gravy.  My husband had an omlette which he seemed to enjoy, though the portion looked just a tad small.  Truly a yummy 3-star meal, though the great service just bumped things up even more.  They were just SO nice and so insistent that we come back, I'm wondering if the location (in the Arizona Mills parking lot) is making the business struggle a bit.  I hope not, because I definitely will return.

I'm really bummed, Yelpers.  I spent a solid 8 years in New York City where, shockingly, they don't have Mongolian BBQ of any kind.  I might as well ask for a unicorn as much as ask someone for Mongolian BBQ.  Growing up, we used to go to this exceptional place in Virginia Beach called the Genghis Khan that was the benchmark for all of my subsequent mongolian BBQ experiences.  It was all you can eat, fresh, tasty and came with delicious soup and this crazy homemade sesame bread (I know - sounds weird from an Asian restaurant, but this bread recipe was super authentic to the region, apparently).  Long story short, my idea of Mongolian BBQ is apparently a far cry from YC's.  Don't get me wrong - the meat and veggies are fresh, the place is super clean and the service is quick.  But shouldn't all of that be a given?  The myriad sauce options are a bit overwhelming if you don't know what you're doing (I was ok saucing for myself, but my husband was confused - good places have a person whom you tell how you'd like it and then sauce for you).  Since the place isn't all you can eat, if you mess up your sauce on the first go, you're stuck with your dish.  Major bummer.  In addition, the whole concept of cramming as much food into a bowl as possible with wax paper and strategizing on how to get the most bang for your buck is really off-putting.  Shouldn't you be able to try different things, graze and casually eat without having to think out your choices like a friggin' game of chess?  Or have to worry about getting a doggie bag for later?  YC's should be a game show the way people scramble to fit as much as they can in a bowl.  The soups are odd - seemingly leftovers from the buffet mixed with broth and then called "wonton" or "spicy beef".  The crispy noodles were stale and tasted of used oil.  We didn't even bother with the frozen yogurt.  A friend who's lived here all his life heard of my search for good Mongolian BBQ and responded "Why?  It's horrible."  I was kind of shocked given that a) he's a good eater and food critic and b) all of my collective experience having Mongolian BBQ up to my going to YC's had been so very good.  I just didn't understand.  Now I'm wondering if YC's is the area's benchmark for which all Mongolian BBQ should be compared to, maybe I should just give up.  It's just not that good at all, and this coming from the girl who'd break off both sets of arms and legs to have even a decent bowl of Mongolian BBQ at this point.  No fair, YC's. No fair.

Do not be swayed by the dingy office park that this place is located in or the fact that it looks like a redecorated Ponderosa Steak House.  This place was the ONLY place in the valley that could meet my stringent 4-point criteria for fajita perfection.  1) Tortillas must be freshly made in house and of the thick and chewy variety.  CHECK!  As much as I love me a paper thin authentic tortilla to sop up posole or machaca, when it comes to fajitas, I need what I have now learned are sometimes dubbed Texas tortillas that are pillowy, warm and slightly chewy.  Fajitas makes them with skill.  Love.  2) The chicken or steak should be grilled, preferably over mesquite.  CHECK!  Charred goodness awaits you, and those guys behind the grill are masters of their craft.  3) Steak should be able to be ordered medium rare or rare.  CHECK!  Although you can't specify the temperature of the meat, if you order the Cadillac Fajitas made of beef tenderloin, they come out blissfully mooing in the center.  Heaven.  4) Vegetables should be limited to peppers and onions.  No broccoli, mushrooms, squash, whatever, unless you are ordering vegetarian fajitas.  CHECK!  Ok, I know this is nitpicky, but I don't want my meat, pepper and onion experience to be sullied with broccoli.  Additionally, if you like shrimp, ORDER THE SHRIMP FAJITAS.  I don't know what they marinate them in or how they cook them, but those babies are like crack.  Pure, unadulterated crack.  Other bonuses - the portions are huge without sacrificing quality, making the whole experience a killer value.  You literally get a raft of guacamole, pico de gallo, sour cream and cheese to top your fajitas, making a half pound portion plenty to share.  Or don't share and take home the leftovers.  Chips and salsa are yummy, taking up far too much fajita space in your stomach before you eat, the yellow rice is fluffy and delicious, and though the beans are forgettable, the margarita is potent enough to keep you happy regardless.  We found this place in a moment of frustration at the fact that we couldn't locate the perfect fajitas in the Valley.  So what do we do?  We Yelp "best fajitas in phoenix" and get (duh!) a restaurant called Fajitas.  If it were a snake, it would've bit us.  We still make the trip to Glendale just to feast at this place and swear to play a round of putt-putt at Castles and Coasters afterwards to walk off the excessive fullness.  Alas, most of the time, we just drive home, happy nonetheless.

I heart Los Olivos, and in ways that go over and beyond any other Mexican places I've ever been.  Using my strict algorithm for Mexican perfection of chips, salsa, red sauce and margarita, Los Olivos becomes the benchmark by which all other places are compared.  Love it.  CHIPS are crispy, warm and perfectly thin.  I salt them and go to town on the freshly prepared SALSA, an addictive blend of tomatoes and jalapenos mixed with their HOT SALSA of red chiles and scarcely a tomato.  The flavor is just divine, best washed down with a FRESH LIME MARGARITA and plenty of salt.  I could dine on just the following and call it a day, but if I have a group to share with (or a lion's appetite) I will indulge in a cheese crisp.  The tortilla is pliable and perfectly chewy, and the Mary Lou with green chile con carne comes with a toothsome topping of tender beef chunks braised in green chile sauce and topped with melted cheese.  So good!  Our usual favorites are the beef tamales, crispy chicken tacos, enchiladas of all kinds, the chimichangas (my husband eats the SHRIMP CHIMI every single time we go, without fail) and the sumptuously perfect machaca, served dry with the perfect blend of spices and goodness and a tortilla to boot.  Num num num.  The service can be slow and at times lackadaisical - on other nights, the waiters are attentive and blazingly fast.  Just depends who you get.  If you go on an off night for service, definitely don't give up because the food is so darn tasty.  Rather, go when you have time to kill, eat and drink heartily, and know that you are in for a treat of an evening.  Sidenote: Man peddling roses inside the restaurant is persistent - I'm still trying to figure out who he knows or how he's related to the owners in order to be allowed to interfere with the service in the place.  Your guess is as good as mine.

While I'm a sushi fan, my husband is a sushi FIEND - we made biweekly trips to his favorite haunt in NYC (Monster Sushi) and if he was on his own for dinner, I could always count on him to be there for a bite.  After relocating to Phoenix, he'd been jonesing hardcore for non-commercial, non-fussy sushi in epic proportions served with a smile.  Our trusted source told us that Kyoto was their favorite and we had to indulge.  The mixed views on Yelp made be a tad nervous, but I like to give places an unbiased chance.  Very glad that I did.  The interior of the place is a little strange given the shape of the restaurant and lack of windows, but we made ourselves cozy in a table next to the sushi bar.  I also did not notice a pre-club atmosphere - it was chill the night we went, but maybe it was because we went after work (which is probably on the earlier side for the see and be seens).  No teppan for us that night - it was all about the sushi.  We started with a pleasantly savory miso soup, flavorful seaweed salad and moist, tender tako (octopus) salad.  Next was my favorite dish of the night (and no, not traditional for sushi, but whatever) - a peppered, seared tuna with onion sauce.  Divine!  I could have had three plates of this and called it a day.  Most of the folks in our party ordered rather classic rolls, while I ordered an additional three specialty rolls (Candy Cane, Ichi and Shrimp Tempura - I love to crunch it out).  The rolls were so HUGE we struggled to eat it all.  Keep in mind that those specialty rolls are massive, particularly the Ichi (should have been called Ichi the Killer Roll) which you could barely eat with chopsticks.  I was a mess of dungeoness crab and spicy tuna by the end of the night, but I was happy.  Price was absolutely fair for the quality of the food - there are many (MANY) overprices sushi places in Scottsdale and many dirt cheap places in the valley.  This one charges fairly and keeps the quality up.  I don't ever mind paying if it's worth it.  Will most definitely come back and hopefully take in some teppan next time :)

My Persian sister-from-another-mother took me here for the first time, and I am mad at her.  Not because this place is bad - oh no, it's spectacular.  I'm mad at her because of the fact that I crave these kebabs fortnightly.  I think I even dream about them.  Next time I see her, I'm going to hit her with a skewer of lamb koobideh.  And then eat it.  Persian Room is literally a palace, with a fountain in the middle of the dining room and golden plates.  The servers are working at a steady clip (although it's been evident on some visits that a slim few are way out of their league in terms of keeping up with the hustle), toting out fluffy mounds of rice and simply grilled meats to tables of customers dressed to the nines and dressed down in denim.  All have a place at this feast, whether it's date night or late night kebab craving.  We typically get the Shallot Yogurt or Eggplant with Whey as a starter so that we can sop up the deliciousness with the warm bread that is baked right in the dining room.  Of the kebabs, I'm madly in love with the chicken tenderloin kebab, the mahi mahi (which I have learned that in Farsi translates to "fish fish" - yes, I love the fish fish) and the aforementioned lamb koobideh.  You can stick with the fluffy white rice that comes standard, but I always sub in the Sabzi Polo (or green rice) that is studded with every herb in the garden for a glorious accompaniment to the kebobs.  If you can make it to tea and dessert, more power to you.  These portions are killer and the platters are behemoth.  Although, I have to say that in addition to feasting on the majesty while I am there, I do look forward to the leftovers later.  It's like the Persian gift that keeps on giving.

Aside from the suspect bouncer last time I visited (When my companion asked why I was being carded and she was not, the guy replied that she looked honest and I looked shady - I know you're trying to be funny and not call attention to our ages, man, but you don't have to act like a d-bag in the process), this place is ALWAYS wonderful.  The beer is excellent and the seasonal rotations are always worth trying.  And the food is exceptionally good given that you'll be eating it in what looks like a giant barn.  The place oozes character and the vibe is chill.  Certainly up high on my list of best beer houses in the nation (with DC's Brickskeller holding the #1 spot).  Good times.

An out and out gem - the quality and the portions at this place blow my mind, making Khai Hoan stand out as a true Vietnamese gem in the valley.  For me, happiness at a Vietnamese restaurant is a big old glass of young coconut juice with fresh coconut pieces and lots of fresh herbs for whatever I choose to order - whether it's Meatball Pho or Bun with Grilled Pork or even crispy Cha Gio,  give me tons of greenery to use and a sea of nuoc mam for dipping.  This place keeps me beyond happy - the pho comes out piping hot and brimming with rice noodles and meat.  They do not skimp, whereas a lot of other places in the Valley cheap out.  Plus, their broth is fragrant and not greasy, making it a go-to if I've got the sniffles.  I typically come here for lunch and they do a bustling business - folks know that this place gets the job done and they show up.  You shouldn't have a problem getting a table as the service moves quickly.  What's not to love?

A little kindness goes a long way, boys.  This review is for the 3 star lunch buffet and the 1 star service.  I have to admit that I am out and out soured for most Indian buffets in that my fave one in DC, Ragaa, makes me weep how good it is.  But one of my fellow Yelp buddies said this place made her belly happy, so I gave it a try. The smells and sight of the sparkling dining room made me thing that good things were coming my way.  As I perused the buffet, I noticed that it was really geared towards quantity rather than quality.  Tandoori chicken was way overcooked (and all dark meat - not a big deal, but it seems like they are saving the white meat for something else - maybe dinner?) and the other meat dishes were just so-so.  Saag paneer was tasty, as was the daal, but both forgettable.  And the rice!  It wasn't fluffy and light like you'd expect, but a little crunchy - a sin at an Indian restaurant as far as I'm concerned!  The only true delight is the warm, hot naan that they bring by to sop up the sauce on your plate.  I could make a meal of just it, except that $10 is a little steep.  My true issue with the place is the sheer lack of kindness on the face of anyone that works there.  It's like they are pissed off that they have to serve you and want to be elsewhere.  Fine by me!  Go away and have someone else serve me that'll say "You're welcome!" when I say "Thank you" instead of scowling and walking away.  We actually got into an argument the first time I went there - we were a party of three, but a friend was coming so I asked for a table for four.  The friend never came, so we were surprised when they charged us for four buffets and then put up a fight when we asked to take the fourth charge off for a person that was never there.  Come on, man!  You served us bread and water our entire meal - you saw only the three of us.  Sad.  I have to admit, I do return to this place when friends suggest it for lunch - like a drunken hookup, I fall into it and then ask myself what I am doing once I am there.  I need to scope the valley for a new place and stop giving in to convenience of location.

V is for very, very, extra ordinary.  Not extraordinary, kids - just ordinary.  Prices are in line with most pho joints, but they are a little sneaky and cut corners with the servings.  The portions are large, however they majorly skimp on the rice noodles and meat - it's mostly broth and whatever greenery you choose to add.  In a large bowl of raw beef with meatballs, I had 3 meatballs and 4 thin slices of beef, and the equivalent of three mouthfuls of noodles.  PLUS I have to take away a star for a lack of mint - we had cilantro and basil but no mint.  It made me sad almost.  Cha gio (crispy spring rolls) were nearly devoid of filling, like mini cigarettes rather than the fat cigars you'd expect them to be.  Despite being tasty, they didn't com with any lettuce or greens to wrap them in to dip in the nuoc mam.  This also made me frown a bit.  Young coconut juice was delicious and fun, and left me scraping out the coconut for the tender flesh long after my soup and spring rolls were over.  I'm not at all pressed to go back - it was so ho hum for the cost, and there are so many places in the area that are much more generous with their dishes.

For all of my high brow tastes, I am a self-proclaimed hot dog addict - I always have time for a hot dog competition that involves me and a line of the bun-swaddled treats.  You don't even have to slow me down with mustard - I'll take them any way they come.  Dave's Dog House is pretty excellent for a hot dog jones, and damn convenient for anyone at ASU.  The place churns out exceptional dogs with natural casings that pop when you bite into them, the way that pantheons of dog-dome (like Gray's Papaya and Nathan's for you NYCers).  Top that off with buttered and griddled buns and crisp fries and you are in for a treat.  I like the Boston Dog myself - just a bit of onions, mustard and relish to dress things up, but you can partake in chili or saurkraut as well and make it a party.  Dave is shy of the 5 star rating for me because they can be a little slow at times, and not due to large crowds per se, but due to organization.  It often seems like they're training new employees on the job and your order will take a good 5-10 minutes to come out even though only you and one other person are waiting there.  It can be trying if you are in a hurry, but not so bad that you should skip this place.  Also, their chili is a little strange - on a hot dog, it's one thing because there isn't too much.  But on, say, chili fries, you notice how the texture resembles paste.  I almost recommend that you don't sully your experience with the odd chili and just focus on the hot doggy goodness.  Also, if you are around after 4pm, the place has really good Happy Hour specials that rotate monthly, from $1 sliders (on griddled brioche, no less) to $1.75 corn dogs (fried to order).  Well worth the price if it's your first time at Dave's.

One of my favorite spots in Phoenix, Richardson's always seems to cure me of whatever is ailing me with a Prickly Pear Margarita and a healthy dose of scorching chiles.  Don't let the location (a dingy strip mall) or the laid-back waiters fool you - the food is top notch and a bit upscale.  The dark restaurant and tucked away booths make the place seem like the setting for a clandestine meeting.  Chile Relleno and the Carne Adovada are both toothsome, while the enchiladas are a treat for cheese lovers and chile fiends alike.  Richardson's makes the distinction that they are New Mexican cuisine, and although they are not what you would find in Mom and Pop Albuquerque, they are still a red and green driven menu.  Definitely worth a trip!

The trek from Ahwatukee to Glendale is loooong, but luckily I have family in these parts, so we come here often.  Hands down, the best Vietnamese food I've had in the valley, no contest.  The place is a very small converted house, and truly, because of the size, you feel as if you are there for a friend's homecooking rather than at a fancy restaurant.  So small in fact, that if you have a large party (which they can absolutely accommodate, by the way) you should call ahead.  I know some people call this a pho restaurant (and the pho is good - not the best I've ever had, but good) but really, it is absolutely a Vietnamese restaurant first and foremost.  Given the extensive menu with a long list of homestyle dishes, pho doesn't take a backseat, but it's certainly not the star of the show.  The one thing that I love about Little Saigon is that every dish comes with copious condiments.  Cha gio (crispy spring rolls) come with mounds of lettuce, cilantro, mint, carrots and daikon with bright nuoc mam (fish sauce) for dipping.  All of the soups include cilantro, mint, basil, bean sprouts, jalapeno and lime - I will instantly dock points if I'm having pho and I don't get all of the above.  Plus, crazy good dishes like the Curry Catfish with Black Pepper Sauce (served on a sizzling plate for two) come with rice and lettuce for wrapping as well.  Favorites of mine are the Summer Rolls with tasty shrimp and bits of grilled beef, Bun with Grilled Pork, the Pho with Meatballs and the Caramelized Catfish.  Even the fried rice that my husband always gets is savory goodness.  One important thing to note, though the waiters are perennially friendly and bustling, and the owner/chef is fabulous, this is not the place to make special recommendations or changes to the dishes.  If you are a fussy eater or want things your way, 9 times out of 10, you will not win that battle.  We've been coming here a while, and have seen some interesting antics between the kitchen and the dining room.  Just order and enjoy, the food truly is so good, you shouldn't have to make special requests as it is.  Very very worth the trip to Glendale.  I'm jealous of you guys, west side!

A Hideaway this restaurant certainly is - tucked into a derelict looking shopping center is a haven for delicious Southwest cuisine.  If Richardson's around the corner is packed, or you are looking for a new brunch option, stroll around the corner to Dick's.  Keep in mind that this place is literally a nook, so go with a small party rather than 50 of your closest friends.  The place is kind of sexy as it is, so an initmate gathering would be a better call.  Food is delicious, smoking hot, and inventive.  Not a chips and salsa joint, but more like inspired New Mexican cuisine.  They take some liberties with their green and red chile laden menu, but the dishes impress nonetheless.

Dining at Carolina's always reminds me of how things can be just so right with the world, all without any extra trouble or fuss.  The place is always hopping with a bustling counter crowd, particularly after work with takeout orders.  Machaca (in anything) is moist and flavorful, and the tortillas are whisper thin, just the right amount chewy, and perfectly cooked - the perfect home to any conceivable filling combo.  Better yet, you can get tortillas by the dozen to take home and fill as you please.  Something to think about the next time you have guests over for margarita night and want to impress the socks off of them with nibbles.  Hatch chili cheese crisps anyone?  This place is unequivocally not for people who want romance, candlelight, ambiance and serenades with their tortillas.  It's for people who like their aguafrescas in styrofoam cups, their red and green chile combos on plastic trays, and don't mind counter service and booth seating.  Basically, it's unfussy heaven.  A caveat - come here for the tortillas more than the combo plates.  You can find better tamales and tacos all over the city, whereas the tortillas are the main attraction.  Treat it like going to a seafood restaurant and purposefully NOT ordering the steak.  To do otherwise would be silly, kids.

I'm crushing on Snapdragon hard - my lil' oasis of cool in the sweltering desert.  Found this place on Yelp and went totally nervous about having my curly locks chopped for the first time since moving here from NYC.  Apparently, my worries were completely unnecessary as these stylist know their shit and wield a pair of scissors like a paintbrush.  At my last visit, Ana took super good care of me, listening to all of my requests (namely, a low-maintenence, super short cut that would play up the fact that my hair wants to do nothing else but curl), and gave me a style that I am constantly complimented on.  Adore.  The whole place smells like roses, and I leave feeling like I've been hanging out in a friend's awesome apartment rather than a salon.  Oh, and I covet the decor - COVET it.  I think the (salted caramel) icing on the cupcake is the fact that the stylists and front desk folks walk the line between professional, chill and sweet.  They get the job done, but keep you blissfully relaxed the entire time.  Love love love.

Just like the balance of color and light in a masterpiece of a painting, Sacks knows how to craft a perfect balance of ingredients into a masterful sandwich.  Num, num, num - these are no ordinary sandwiches, and the world seems to know because the place is usually hopping.  In a world where the steak and cheese is merely pedestrian, Sacks Encore elevates it to new heights with a savory dose of jalapenos and yogurt sauce - it's one of those "WTF am I eating? This is so good!" kinds of moments.  The cookies have been a little more crispy than soft lately, but don't let that sway you.  And the Spiced Iced Tea is glorious - like drinking cooled chai with just the right amounts of sugar and lemon.  In a world where calories can be expended so cheaply, this is a great way to fill your belly and excite your taste buds all in one fell swoop.  PS. Why is it, though, that they have spaghetti and meatballs?  A friend tried it out and despite all the vitriole on the menu about their being handmade and glorious, the meatballs were anemic, the spaghetti ordinary and the sauce nothing to write home about.  Strange.  Oh, well.  The sandwiches are still some glory.

Oh, Aureole.  I think you've single-handedly squelched my love for Charlie Palmer.  Granted, I am sure that he wasn't in the kitchen making my food that night, but still.  My husband had previously come here and wanted to take me for serious meal and some wine angel action.  So much for that - looking for a romantic night, we were seated next to a European couple who were clearly drunk and fighting with each other their whole meal.  And the restaurant was about 25% full yet we were seated next to the drama squad.  Eek.  We both had the 9 course menu with wine pairings and every single dish needed editing.  A sublime seared diver scallop with beurre blanc was lost under a mess of pea shoots that negated the gentle flavor of the seafood.  Kobe beef came with about 3 too many garnishes that proved distracting from the main event.  After about four courses that I'd call no less than a hot mess on a plate, I was tired.  And I mean exhausted.  I kind of just wanted to leave, take a nap, and then figure out something to eat for dinner.  Maybe I was asking for too much in expecting to be wowed, but when a chef takes the time and energy to plan out nine courses with intricate wine pairings, you should feel excited and envigorated with the presentation of each course.  Instead, it was more like the staff came out almost mechanically, trying to get us through each course and then get us on our way.  I felt the lack of love at every turn, and I was so hoping that this place would be on my list of favorite dining experiences of all time.  Not by a long shot.

I really (really really) wanted to love Aiello's.  I am a voracious champion of the red-sauce joint, very different than the traditional Italian-from-Italy meal.  The catch phrase "East Coast Italian" spoke leagues of poetry to me - calamari, eggplant parm, and mounds and mounds of tiramisu.  Upon examining the menu, my grandmother and I saw Scungili (similar to conch) and were sold - she was transported back to her days in Brooklyn and felt an atavistic longing to give the place a try.  Aiello's has made us an offer that we couldn't refuse.  With husbands in tow, we went for a nice dinner and a trip down memory lane.  Disarmed from the get-go, we walked in to Chef Joe working the room and eventually getting around to seating us.  You can tell he's a professional charmer, he immediately asked us why we didn't answer the phone that was ringing at the host's stand.  Our waiter and Chef Joe took turns all night proffering jokes and witticisms - I didn't have a huge problem with it and chalked it up to friendliness, but my husband thought it came off as smarmy to the point of distraction.  I had only wished that Chef Joe might spend a little more time in the actual kitchen.  Bread basket contained a homemade foccacia and a delicious accompaniment of cherry peppers in olive oil.  Probably the best thing we had all night.  Caesar salad was missing a dose of anchovies and garlic - rather bland and one-dimensional.  Calamari and fried zucchini were both oily and needing of a good squeeze of lemon and marinara for dipping in order to make them a little more palatable.  For the entrees, my Tortelloni alla Panna were so-so - the pasta was fresh and tasty but again, the cream sauce was one dimensional rather than being luxe and silken as you'd want it to be.  My husband had a chicken breast Saltimbocca that was almost inedible - it was so overcooked, he could barely cut through it.  Very disappointing.  Scungili over linguine was indeed tender, but in need of a heavy dose of red pepper and not at all memorable.  The homemade ravioli of the night was prosciutto and caramelized onion - again just so-so.  Not a single taste on the table to challenge us to come back.  The night was finished with Chef Joe's "Pick a Number" game - he pulls a random number (1-80, I believe) out of what looks like a carafe and if it's the one you've guessed, your meal is on him (minus the alcohol).  I kind of wished we'd won, because 3 appetizers, 4 entrees and wine came to $50/pp before tax and tip.  I'm not a price queen, but if I'm spending the money, wow me a little.  All that flair and attention in the dining room, but none of it in the kitchen.  There are WAY too many great Italian places in Phoenix to not bring your A-game every time.  Plain and simple.

Pleasantly surprised by Thai Elephant - and I love Evan B.'s comment about the lack of elephant on the menu.  It's a small place, so maybe they didn't have room to prep the pachyderm for Elephant with Basil.  But I digress...  Came here before a show at the Dodge and we were one of many tables doing the same.  The waitress asked us before we sat down if we were headed to a concert afterwards - gotta love the attentiveness from the get go.  The food came out quickly and was prepared well - huge portions of food and tons of veggies in just about everything.  Off topic - I've noticed that in AZ it seems that a lot of the Thai places put mixed veggies in every dish and just change up the carb, protein and sauce.  Not a bad thing per se, but just a little strange.  Case in point, my drunken noodles (usually chow fun noodles, onions, tomatoes and basil) had pad thai noodles with cabbage, carrots, broccoli, green beans and more.  It looked exactly like the plate of pad thai plus veggie mix.  Random, but it was tasty and I wasn't feeling like a snob ;)  I asked for my food "Thai Hot" and damn, it was just that.  I'm a bit of a spice queen, and this was the first place I've been where it's been as hot as promised.  Like lip-numbing goodness.  If you don't like it hot, take it easy here.  I don't know if I'd take a separate trip here unless I was already downtown, but it was worth a return visit.

4.5 stars, but mostly because when this place gets ubercrowded, you'd better already be seated and/or buzzed.  Even though this is my happy place on the weekends, I actually adore Hanny's on a weeknight when the lounge vibe is in full effect and I can have a convo and sip my Old Fashioned like a goddamn queen.  But I also love weekends for killing St. Germain martini after martini, rapping to the old school hip hop playing from the DJ booth, occasionally ordering a Proscuitto di Parma pizza to soak up the alcohol from the spots I hit before I made it to Hanny's (I'm talking to you Candlestick Makers at The Arrogant Butcher).  And I second Bryan B's comment about the staff - they definitely remember regulars and make sure to go out of their way to keep you happy.  I think, as an east coast birdie, a good deal of my love of Hanny's is the fact that I feel like I'm back in NYC or DC for a night, all without leaving the valley.  The starkly modern decor that embraces the bones of the old department store that Hanny's calls home is preserved so elegantly well.  And I still giggle as I snap pictures in the abandoned elevator shaft.  The bathrooms aren't gimmicky in my opinion (I love the ecstatic silhouette of the people in wheelchairs!) but you may have to walk past people that don't understand that you need to just push on doors to see which ones are vacant.  Let your city panties show and walk right in.  The menu is tasty enough, but this is a place for bar food and not necessarily a special trip for dinner.  Aside from the aforementioned pizza, the salumi plates are killer (with the prosciutto cut right before your eyes) and the sandwiches similar to the offerings at AZ88.  Eat before you come, and sip away on bespoke cocktails strong enough to set your ass a-groovin.  That's why you came, isn't it?

Hot mess.  Reviewing for nightlife, not food, though based on my experience and fellow Yelp reviews, I'd hardly try this place for a meal.  Went out with friends after an out-of-town friend wanted to hookah it up and another friend said he knew the owner of the place.  We got a table, ordered unlimited flavors and watched the ridiculous display begin.  Bouncers moonlight as servers, bringing hookahs and helping out as needed - unfortunately, some were much better than others with attentiveness and service.  Very frustrating and a waste of the unlimited flavors.  This could have been partially because of the fact that the majority of the clientele were three sheets to the wind.  Not a problem except for the fact that in our short time there, not one, not two, but three people threw up on themselves right next to us.  Also had a lot of people come try to sit at our table when people in our party went to the bathroom or the bar - mostly guys hitting on the girls in our group and trying to bum off the hookah.  Watched a group of guys swoop in and commandeer another table's hookah after the 21st birthday girl threw up on the table and their party left abruptly.  I'll pay for my hookah, thank you.  Last call and the place is a sloppy mess - I literally had to stretch my feet out in my heels to keep my shoes on my feet, the floor was so sticky.  Made it out just in time to see one of the guys who was trying to bogart our table get hogtied and arrested on Mill.  Random.  Shan't return.

We adore this location of Hon Machi as my husband can fill up on sushi and I can get teppan delivered to my table in the regular dining room without having to sit through the show.  Not to mention the fact that you have a direct view of the teppan spectacle from the dining room.  I typically order the exact same thing every time - gyoza (fried from frozen, I'm sure, but I could care less), the steak and shrimp dinner and a massive mound of fried rice, vegetables plus salad and miso soup.  It's not the cheapest meal, but the food comes out deliciously hot and tasty, so we always end up returning.  My husband swears by both the quality and portion size of their sushi with their rainbow roll and lobster roll as two of his favorites.  We have always had good service in the dining room, but because the waiters have to work both our side of the restaurant and the cooking tables, I've seen some pretty sluggish service for other tables at times.  Knock on wood - we've never been one of those unfortunate tables waiting an eternity for someone to take their drink order.  also worth mentioning, there is usually a long wait for teppan tables on the weekend, with lots of families and prom dates going for dinner.  If you sit in the dining room, you can pretty much bypass the wait and they will still serve you the entire menu.  Also, with all of the cooking going on, this place tends to get a  little warm sometimes, so dress accordingly.  All in all, one of my favorite Japanese places in the Valley :)

I'm gonna be that girl who writes a review just based on drinking (boo! hiss!) but know that I am wholeheartedly returning to fully review Hula's from soup to nuts.  Whether soup and nuts are on the menu that night or not.  From the start, Hula's seemed way up my alley - the fine marriage of sexy-class with kitschy tiki wonder.  The name says it all, and my being a girl who enjoys a little Polynesian flair, I just had to go.  The space is intriguing - like a modular spaceship tucked into the desert, decorated by a holdover from Trader Vics.  I came here to drink while waiting for friends and was bowled over by the Happy Hour prices in correlation to the quality of the drinks.  I had just read a scintillating post on ChowHound about the oft misunderstood Mai Tai - no pineapple juice or grenadine but copious amounts of rum and a bit of Orgeat (an almond liquer).  Hula's is as authentic as they come, addictively drinkable and potent while still maintaining the smoothness and characteristic flavor.  I fell in love.  Servers and bartenders are laid back and charming, and the atmosphere is bubbly without being too boisterous.  I'll definitely come back and tuck into food next time, because you all know I can't just sip and dash.

I have a like/hate relationship with Thai Basil.  My gourmand of a self thinks that on many levels, it's the penultimate example of the gentrification of world cuisine - as if Arizonans couldn't handle the dishes as they'd been prepared in Thailand, every dish was constructed with a pre-picked starch, meat and sauce, same vegetables in every single friggin' dish.  Thai Basil Beef? Cabbage, broccoli, carrots, zuchini, red peppers and bamboo shoots.  Fried Rice? Rice, cabbage, broccoli, carrots, zuchini, red peppers and bamboo shoots.  Spicy Noodles with Shrimp? Rice noodles, shrimp, cabbage, broccoli, carrots, zuchini, red peppers and bamboo shoots.  It's kind of insulting in a way - it's like "Give us some credit and make the food the way you'd make it for yourself! Not the Thai version of Panda Express"  And yet, I go to Thai Basil.  All the time.  When I'm jonesing for stir fry or a mess of rice, it's cheap and plentiful.  And it tastes really good.  Aside from the curries, which are shockingly bland, the rice and noodle dishes are all insanely edible.  It makes me feel guilty for being a hater and demanding that my Thai food taste like Thai food.  In the words of Jamiroquai, "if I like it, I do it..."  I guess this will continue to be my drunken hookup of a restaurant.  I don't want to make my love public, but I'm all up in it like the rest of the crowd.  Ok, I'll put my haterade down now ;)

How could a place with such pedestrian ingredients churn out a sandwich of such deliciousness?  If I were to hold a competition for the most exceptional plain sandwich - the sandwich that would be the benchmark for the sandwiches of the world, this would be it.  You're looking at lettuce, tomato, cheese and protein on a roll.  That's it.  Sprouts, mayo and dressing are about as crazy as you're gonna get.  And yet, your roast beef and turkey are tender and well-seasoned, your hero roll pliant and slightly buttery, the absolute perfect amount of lettuce, tomato and sprouts for the perfect crunch.  You're good, Jimmy Johns.  You're surprisingly good.  Now given that I have a limited amount of time and stomach space for the foods of the world and that I'm typically looking for exceptional dishes to challenge and grow my palette, it irks me a bit that I would truly love a plain jane sandwich such as this.  And yet, I return for that Hunter's Club time and time again.  Thumbs up - I have no qualms with the simple joys of your menu.

Came here for lunch at a co-worker's suggestion and was pleasantly surprised.  Always love when you find a place after absolutely no expectations or preconceived notions.  The menu is as small as the place and pretty much rotates a couple of proteins (carne asada or pastor) within a few formats, and that's it.  Who am I to suggest messing with success - the food was freshly prepared, flavorful and fast.  I had the carne asada quesadilla and a basket of chips and guacamole - $15 (!) but the amount was enough for two to share, so not that big of a deal there.  The quesadilla was unlike one that I'd had before, with finely shredded lettuce, onion and caramelized onions in the interior - a novel concept for me, but a good idea in terms of letting the carne asada steal the show.  Moist and well-seasoned - it provided a moment of taste-bud joy.  Can't give 5 stars only because a) I was not so bowled over by the food that I'd make a special trip here and b) the smell of ceviche almost knocked me down the moment that I set foot in the place.  Don't get me wrong - I love ceviche.  I just don't want the smell of seafood dripping from my pores while I'm eating.  Thank god they have an outdoor patio to eat at.  I'm not at all ambivalent about this place, though - will definitely return.

Everything's sexier with pork belly.  Expecially my belly when it's full of it.  Went here for a happy hour and was cursing myself for taking so damn long to visit the place.  The vibe is perfectly sexy and dimly lit - the kind of place where you can sip lethally addictive cocktails and order dishes that make you feel dirty for eating them, they're so good.  And then you order seconds and then dessert because you've been so bad already, you might as well go for broke.  The pork belly pastrami with brussel sprouts in whole grain mustard made me curse my ill fortune for not being able to eat it at every waking moment.  Unctuous, tender belly - get in my belly.   The heirloom tomato with burrata special was clean in presentation and a celebration of all that is glorious in the summertime, and the sausage and cheese plate was gobbled up so quickly I had to do a doubletake.  Dessert was heaven in an itty-bitty crock with the Black and Tan Pudding - a dark chocolate pot de creme with salted caramel pudding?  So I'm naming my firstborn Citizen Public House now?  Adore.

Who says chains are bad?  Especially when you are looking for something sweet and salty and hot off the grill without all of the unnecessary calories?  Please, I'm saving those for the pork belly pastrami at Citizen Public House - I can't crush it at lunch.  A big ol' bowl of brown rice, toothsome chicken and beef, scallions, broccoli, cabbage and carrots and I'm in heaven.  You could get extra meat, but you'd be gilding the lily.  You could pile on the extra "special" sauce or the sriracha, but it's not necessary - the bowl is full of flavor and all for a song in terms of price.  Plus, the folks that work there have the assembly line down pat - you are in and out and onto the next adventure with a belly full of goodness.  Lunch happiness :)

Fans of good Texas-style BBQ (sauceless meat fests where your only true side dish is white bread, onions and jalapenos served up on butcher paper) will find delight here.  There is BBQ sauce, but it's an afterthought.  You can get sides of meaty pintos, creamy cole slaw, gooey mac and cheese and damn near sinful creamed corn.  But honestly, all of the above compete with the space you're gonna want to reserve for the meat.    As far as I am concerned, the two offerings that I have dreams about are the fatty brisket (fall apart goodness that's juicy as hell) and the jalapeno sausage.  I slip into an amnesiac's haze when I eat them, devouring all in front of me and awakening once they are all gone.  Smoked turkey is surprisingly moist and full of flavor, and the pork loin is light and delicious.  The only miss on the menu for me is the chop beef - a near mash of meat and sauce that just doesn't do the trick.  Get a big ol' sweet tea before you leave, and order more than you think you'll eat, because you will definitely want it.  No fuss, no muss, just carnivore heaven.  PS. A lot of people have reviews here and they are for the Scottsdale location and not this place.  This one is in the middle of nowhere in Central Phoenix - it looks kind of like a roadhouse, which lends to the appeal.

Love the Bagel Man - although some of the kids he has making the sandwiches can be slooooooooooooow, the food is tasty and the bagels are the perfect amount of crusty outside and tender inside that makes me miss NYC some kinda bad.  My husband and the owner chat about New York every time he goes in there, reminding us that there's more to life than grab your food and go - this is a neighborhood joint and repeat visitors are remembered and appreciated.  Although we typically go there for bagels and bialys (they run out QUICK!), the sandwiches are killer as well, particularly the Reuben.  The place is pretty small and in a nondescript shopping center on Elliott, so you'll probably want to grab your food and go.  Perfect for mornings when you want breakfast in a hurry and fast food joints aren't on the menu.
