Amy is fantastic, makes you feel as comfortable as possible during a Brazilian. I won't go anywhere else!

Went today for Mother's Day Breakfast, mom's pick. Had a reservation for 5 adults 2 kids at 0930. Atmosphere is very cute, the birds are fun to look at. Although, they can get quite loud and it's hard to hold a conversation. But that's the whole idea of the place, the birds!!! I get it. About 10 choices on the breakfast menu, and you can't order off of the main menu until 11, which I can understand. It was quite busy, which is expected. Apparently 0930 is when a big rush of parties were seated, after our order was taken our server came over to announce that the ticket times were running at about 30 minutes since everyone's order was put in at once. No big deal! Coffee was delicious and strong, $0.10 mimosas for mothers day, birds chirping........ An hour later, still no food. At this point I notice how a table of 4 which got sat after we had put our food order in got their food before us, and were about half way through eating before we even got our food. Every food item was cold. At this point I just wanted to be done, worked the night before I just wanted to go home, and I didn't want to wait another hour for more food. I expect this at Denny's when you're paying $3.99 for a Grand Slam or whatever, but when you are paying $12-$14 per entree, I want it to be hot! After reading all of the other reviews, I'm not so sure I'm in a hurry to go back.

Love love this place! I've been twice now and I'm hooked. I drive from East Mesa to indulge in their coffees. I have had The Luck of the Irish, Chocolate Mac Attack, Red Velvet, and Tres Leches. Yum yum, keep up the good work!

The BEST!!! Also super clean inside. This is my favorite spot out of all the Bosa's. Way better than DD, in my opinion. Coffee is also delish

After reading all of the other Yelp reviews, I knew I was gonna like this place. Well, like is an understatement. I LOVED this place. Everything about it. The simple decor, to the fact that your sandwich is delivered in a paper wrapper. So simple, but sooo absolutely delicious. I tried the Reuben and the Crispy Chicken sandwich. Both delish, and the chips are yummy too! You can tell that everything is so fresh. I can't wait to go back and try something different!

Love, love, love. Everything was fantastic, I think it's very reasonably priced and you pay for the freshness. After all, you don't walk out of Coldstone paying less than $5.  I'd much rather get a Sammie with that money any day. I live 30 minutes away and will gladly make the drive! Customer service is great.
