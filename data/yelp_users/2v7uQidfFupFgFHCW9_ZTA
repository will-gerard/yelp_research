Only giving a star because I can't leave zero. I will never return here. I would drive 30 miles out of my way to go somewhere else. I have been in the waiting room for over two hours at this point and they have even taken someone back who arrived AFTER me, even after I pointed out that I arrived here first.  I'm not sure what the problem is, but this facility seems to be extremely poorly run, inefficient, and inconsiderate. Save yourself some time and just go to the emergency room instead.

A friend told me I needed to come and check this place out as it was one of the best burgers she had ever had. She was not wrong! I ordered The Ivan with cheddar and bacon, and it was delicious! Not only was the food fantastic, they had a great selection of draughts, and the service was equally great. Our server was attentive and entertaining and overall made for a really enjoyable experience. We will definitely be back!
