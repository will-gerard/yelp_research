I went here twice over the weekend, once in Scottsdale and once here in Chandler on ray. I must say I think the service is indeed better at the one on Ray, food taste more as it should here too. I had their vegas roll, totally delicious! I love the happy hour here more than anything! Ill be returning again and again...  I'm glad I finally found a sushi place that almost can hold it's own against the ones I frequented in CA.

So I had to take my pug here last night cause he decided to eat chocolate, the first front desk lady that helped me was super nice.  Vet tech and vet were awesome and very helpful.  They explained to me how to give him the charcoal when I got home for the rest of his treatment.   My Issue with this place was the lady that was helping me check out when I was trying to leave.  She was condescending and rude... she was all 'well maybe you shouldnt let your dog get into chocolate then you wouldnt have to bring him here" UMMM no shit lady, yes it was my plan in life to give my dog chocolate so we had to take him to the emergency room at 1130... I really wanted to spend 300$ on my dog! Ahhh!  Other than that one front desk girl that seems to hate her life they were awesome here.

I had to call here today cause I had a question about my pug... he's been a little sick poor guy.  Anyways the lady promptly got me a vet tech on the phone.  She was very helpful.  She didn't tell me to rush my dog in like some places would do.  She gave me a lot of tips and signs on when I would need to actually bring him into the vet.  Thanks for the comfort and help guys!

Margaritas are fantastic!! And I love their salsa and beans that come with the chips.  We usually fight over the beans, I build a fortress around them so people have to plot a plan to get them:) You think I'm kidding... but no. lol  Last time I was here I had some chilis that were stuffed with shrimp... it was super delicious.  The inside is always clean, but I won't sit outside since I'm deathly afraid of birds, and they are all about the deck here. Cause people feed them! Come on now it's wild life... they need to know not to rely on food from humans. Oh well that's not the restaurants fault.

Sunday Funday til 6pm... awesome for sure! Good deals on drinks... and food. It's in the bar only. But still totally legit. It was dark in the booth we were sitting in though, damn if I can't read a menu now and I'm only 27 what does that say about my future in a dark booth... anyone know of a good lasik eye surgeon... lol?!?!

This place is delicious. If you like pho #12 is my personal favorite. Oh and the spring rolls so amazing ... Fried tofu is on point the sauce with it is to die for legitimately. String beans with pork is great. Really I haven't had anything I don't like here   They can get super busy here but worth the wait. This is my favorite pho place around

I love this coffee bean and tea leaf... I was so excited when I moved here and drove by it. I was a little worried there wouldn't be one and i would only get it when I go to Malibu to visit family.  The staff is super friendly I always get a iced non fat vanilla latte... Mmm super delicious best out of all coffee shops hands down

So happy to have accidentally found this place! Hamachi X Hamachi roll is so delicious, and I may actually punch a stranger for the Volcano roll... oh cherry blossom roll they are all amazing!!  I get my food to go from here since I usually go on my lunch break from work. They are all SO friendly welcome me everytime I come in and say goodbye whole heartedly. The woman whom answers the phone knows my name now... obviously I have a sushi problem.. hey it could be worse  I highly advise you to go here

Yet again another place I go to for beverages, usually after work and a long rough day. Super friendly staff, they always have the games on I want to watch.  Probably my favorite sports bar around my house... I havent eaten anything here, but next time I'm gonna give the wings a whirl.

Ok so I love me some Mongolian stir fry. My friend showed me how to pack the food down and stack it up high. We took our food to go since the girls were sitting in the car... Simmer down people the ac was still on :)  Anyways when we got o my friends house I was so excited for this it smelt so damn delicious... The taste was up to what I was hoping for. What I was not hoping for was the worst stomachache and cramps ever 20 min after eating.  I mean sure it could have been a fluke but maybe other people don't want to talk about their stomach issues but I have no shame. Well same thing happened to my friend. So I'm thinking it's not a coincidence.  I may go back but only to test the theory. I'll take my nemisus here but wouldn't take  someone I was trying to impress...

down grading to a one star due to the fact that I have had a few people email me on here letting me know they too have gotten sick from this place! Eat at your own risk! Don't say I didn't warn you

FINALLY!!! A wine bar in AZ that stands up to the ones I miss from the bay area! Delicious flights of wine. MY cousin and I went while she was visiting in town. So amazing. She had a flight of all reds, i had a chad and 2 pinot noirs.... perfect, and then followed it up with a glass of one of the wines. MMM! We also shared a little flat bread.  One downfall I couldn't read the menu... SHIT this seems to be a thing for me... Maybe new contacts are needed.  Had to take my phone out so my cousin and I could read the menu. Our waitress was a little confused, maybe she had too much fun last night:)   Overall LOVE this place, and think I will become a regular here! 2 flights of wine, 2 full glasses and a flat bread all for about 60$ that's not bad at all...

Atmosphere here is perfect. We sit outside all the time, scoop out a spot by the heater, since it's usually night when we get there. They have beer specials late night which in my book is perfect.  I was here yet again with some amazing people the other night... we're that table that never stops laughing and is always having a good tme.  The food... ok so I've only eaten the food here once, and I ordered the fish & chips... it says best in town. Not the greatest tasting food ever I was incredibly hungry and ate most my fish, and all the cole slaw. I must admit I am a used to really amazing fish & chips moving to AZ from San Francisco and always being in Malibu. But considering I'm now in the middle of the desert they were pretty legit.  I would say go here and drink your night away. I love people watching here and sitting outside in the trees I feel like I'm in  a secret spot where you could possibly see a unicorn.

Fresh seafood everyday. We ordered some oysters asked for them to be shucked and mosey on over to the watering hole for delicious beers and wine.  All the fresh meats seafood and salads here are delicious. Grab some food and hang out with a beer or wine. Great people watching.  Employees are super friendly and helpful. One of the best grocery stores around and hey there is even a bar :)

OK so from my HORRID experiences at all other chilis I've been to it took a lot for me to even give this place a try... Granted no way no how I would order a salad from this place... (Past Chilis salad experiences include having my salad be alive... there was a cockroach/pincher bug in it, and before that an industrial staple in one) So I"m sure you can imagine me being hesitant.  Anyways my friends wanted to go here, I was in their car... whatever fine... I'll just drink my calories:) I agreed to try the chips and guacamole. They were straight up legit.  I also had some fried jalapenos... yumm All day happy hour on Sundays... sing me up. I'm a sucker for cheap liquor:)  Oh also there is always some sort of entertainment happening... not by their choice more on the line of random ridiculously drunk people. And I'm not one of those people

This place was awesome. The people that work here are super friendly. The I'm assuming manager came and apologized over and over cause our waitress accidentally dropped the hookah so it shattered everywhere and it took 5 min to get a new one. Seriously not a problem at all.  We will be going back for sure. Super convenient and and friendly people. Awesome experience. Oh the only downfall is they didn't have coffee at night so I settled for water

Save your time energy and stress. Don't even step foot in this place. Such a joke. From the moment we walked in the manager (owner) I'm not sure was being rude to her employees scolding them like children. The server looked embarrassed.   We were seated by said rude lady who didn't really say much and dropped the menus. We came here since it was recommended and bypassed or normal Sushi spot. Big mistake.... So once we were seated nothing there were multiple people working yet no one would come to our table to serve us. No one even brought us water. 5 minutes in I was annoyed... I was hangry when we got there and was looking forward to miso. Server came to the table next to us we tried to get his attention.... No luck. I told my husband we should leave, we decided to give them 3 more minutes, since now we have been there at least 10 minutes with absolutely zero acknowledgement. Another table was sat two away from us they get served right away. Someone comes to their table and asks what they would like to drink/eat.  That was my breaking point. We got up to leave and were walking out, only to be finally acknowledged with a thank you for coming, I let him know we had never been served, so we were leaving.   I would suggest Ninja for all you can eat in the close vicinity. I will not waste my time or energy ever again at this poor  excuse for a restaurant. Learn to serve your customers. Be pleasant to the customers and acknowledge them or at least let them know a server will be right with them.

Omg swoon!!!! Best food I've had since moving here from San Francisco actually made me feel like I was back in my familiar foodie scene in s.f now where are the shots of jager... Oh shit right I don't work here just eating here.  Ok so here I go I had the diver scallops.... Amazeballs!!!! They were grilled to perfection not at all over cooked which happens all too often with scallops! Had grille octopus on top and serano ham slices that I think were flashed fried... On top of a delicious sauce. Seriously I would injure someone for another serving. Also a great selection of wine which I'm always a fan of. We all shared the espresso churros came with a milkshake that used all my will power not to try (lactose intolerant and all) boo for that btw. Anyways I'm not a dessert person but damn those were tasty deliciousness! Coffee press with dessert too coffee was amazing I'm still on a coffee high. So this is why my friends won't let me drink coffee after 3... It's  all coming full circle now. :)  Totally try this place out! Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm yummy in my tummy!

I had never been here, but kept hearing amazing things about it... So I went the other night with my friends... I was the last minute invite cause they thought I was already out, but I was told they hadn't been seated yet. I literally left right when he called me got there 5 min later and they had been seated. I think the waited 15 min for a table for 6 on a friday night, not bad at all OK onto the food, I had the greek chicken flavor, and it was so tasty!! It came with taziyki sauce on the side that was so heavenly i wanted to lick the container it was in. My room mate had the spicy asiago chicken and he let me have a bite, and yummy! I must say though the flavors in the greek chicken one were seriously amazing, artichoke hearts... sun dried tomatoes just so good.  I will be going back hopefully sometime soon. In the meantime  I  want a vat of the sauce to swim in at home

So ever since moving here to AZ from CA I was hoping to find a local place where the servers/bartenders would know us, and the food and drinks would be legit... DING DING!!! Lucky Lous is awesome... I haven't had anything I wouldn't try again.  Usually share the wings and have some drinks.  Everything is fair priced and the staff cracks me up and is super friendly.   They have a good happy hour from 3-6 and then a drink special every night fro 9-closing.   Oh and they have fried pickles... I like to call them frickles but that's just me.  They are super tasty.  Hot as hell though, make sure you cut them before you get second degree burns on your tongue and lips.  On the wing side of things the Honey Hot ones are delicious but you won't be able to feel your lips after 2 or 3.  My fav is spicy bbq... mmmm

Pretty sure Rita is my fairy godmother!!! I received a dress from MN for a wedding I am flying back to MN for in seriously a week... Low and behold the bust doesn't fit at all. I went to another 'alterations' shop and they said it was impossible to fix and they couldn't so anything. Knowing this couldn't be true I found Rita!  Took my dress in today on my lunch break.. A lot needs to be done *** bust taken out... Waist taken in... Straps remover... And shortened by about 6"*** so this was at 1 I went back after work at 5 she had let out the bust fixing the waist as we speak and fixing the rest... Needless to say I go in for a fitting Friday after work and she's sure it will be done and ready!  I am so relived! It was oober stressful. She's the sweetest lady ever to! Miracle worker I tell you!   ***all my alterations while living here in az will be done by Rita!***

Having 20+ beers on tap to choose from and countless wines is always a plus in my world. Having a bar close to where my husband gets his hair cut is another plus.  Pick up a snack and maybe a meal grab a beer or wine pick your poison and grab a seat. Staff is knowledgable and friendly and people watching is a ten here.

We went here on our lunch break for my birthday last month. Three of my coworkers and me. It took me a while to decide if I was going to write a review or not, once the nausea and stomachache were gone I figured I should attempt to prevent this from happening to anyone else.  There were two or three other tables there, nothing crazy. We were seated, it took a while for someone to come to us so we put in our entire order at one time drinks and lunches. Servers kept walking by our table ignoring us, we finally got our drinks. I was out of water trying to get anyone's attention for a refill my attempts were unnoticed. Oh well I'll ask when the food comes. Server dropped the food and left. Never to come back. We had to go ask for our tabs. One by one since they brought one at a time. We get out food, for the price I would have expected a little more... Oh well I'll have an amazing birthday dinner so this is just lunch.  I ate half my gyro my friend ate half her shrimp appetizer. The meat in the gyro looked strange so I was a little curious, oh well I'm hungry. Went back to work with our leftovers my other friend had half hey gyro left too.  About 30-45 minutes after getting back to work here come the stomach problems felt sick... So sick. I run to the bathroom and well there goes my half of my gyro. So I go and throw away the rest of it. My friend comes up to my desk she too is having some stomach distress. I don't think this is a coincidence.  I was so excited for a Mediterranean place to open close to home and work... Also I adore the patio and ambiance. Oh well I would suggest steering clear maybe go by one of the many other options we have in the area.

My husband and I absolutely love this place. So glad we found it right after it opened. The owner Jennifer is the sweetest lady. The sushi is always spot on. So delicious. Miso is tasty for sure. Nice happy hour specials!  I wish I could eat here nightly. Favorite date night spot for sure. The cardinal roll is so good negihama is perfect. Mmmm I'll have to update when I think of the rolls we always get.
