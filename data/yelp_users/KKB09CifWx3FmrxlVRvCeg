My property management didn't contact me, so I was shocked when the tech showed up. He was outstanding though! He didn't mind that I was a disheveled mess(I was dead asleep when the door bell rang) and had dishes in my dishwasher, which he was here to fix. Not only was he friendly and polite, but he did an excellent job and my dishwasher works perfectly now!

Leaf Verde was nothing but a disaster for our stay. I am an event specialist, and this was a great opportunity for work and to spend with my folks finally! Wow... I can't possibly put into words how discriminate this place is. I thought they were very nice when I left my car up front one evening to avoid any issues with parking and was given a parking pass. I was doing everything in my power to adhere to their rules. After a couple of days, my parking pass was no longer good enough. There was no expiration date and the guard unspoken with had told me that everything was fine. I parked where they said. I didn't make noise. I had a pass!!! I'm not going to be apologetic for being forthcoming about occupations and our hours. I never want to disrupt or cause issues for a business. I will not tolerate someone being nasty just because they already swiped my card and think they can manipulate myself and others thanks to a contract. Don't treat people lousy because you can't be up front with your agenda.

If you have time to be in excruciating pain for a few hours laying in a room waiting for help then I'd say this is a good stop. Honestly should have gone to banner or anywhere but this place. Hysterical crying and no help what so ever. Had to keep asking for someone until they finally came a few hours later. They didn't bother to do a full intake or really ask many questions to determine what was going on. Next time I'm in pain I'll stay home and drink vodka.

Collapsed and hit my head. They got me in quick enough, but I wasn't taken seriously. I had slammed a juice bottle before leaving my home that apparently contained alcohol. I was honest with the staff. They never even once checked my head. Fluids were pushed and that is all. I collapsed and hit my head with no care. I told the nurse I wasn't leaving until I had a proper diagnosis. She was snotty and told me I was drunk. My head is still splitting. Drunk?!?!? I was so disoriented that I had to focus to say my name. The nurse was so rude that I walked out. She threatened to call security. I drove myself home since nobody wanted to see me and treated a TBI flair up as drunk. Guess they don't get a lot of military out this way. I would never go here again. This is the biggest joke in emergency medicine.

Great food but the server had the most awful breath I've ever smelled. Nobody wants to gag when their server is taking their order.

Had a quick turn around on not only getting to my house for a quote but the service as well. The price was more than fair and reasonable, with outstanding service to boot! My yard looks great! I would definitely recommend and will continue to do so myself.

Hands down the best food on the lake. I was told it was good and all, but I was very impressed with the quality and quantity of our lunch! We had a grilled chicken sandwich, a western burger, a turkey burger, and a Cobb salad. We were all very pleased!
