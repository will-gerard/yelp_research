Best sushi in Phoenix, not much else to say. Fish is so fresh, and portion are large, just a great value. They also serve tapanyaki which is really good. Just wish they were open for lunch on weekends.

Went back to Phoenix to visit family and was intent on getting a pastrami sandwich from one of the other deli's but never found the time to go. On the way back home my daughter suggested Capriotti's and I figured it was worth trying it out. When I got there I was dead set on the pastrami, called the "Capastrami", but notice a picture of the "The Bobbie" which is real pulled turkey, stuffing, cranberry, and mayo. I couldn't make up my mind so i ordered both. They were nice enough to give me half of each to eat there, and wrapped the other halves up to take with me, making the 5 hour drive back to SD so much more tolerable. They were both awesome, but I now crave the Bobbie and am making my daughter bring me one out when she comes to visit. :)

Awesome pho, broth is very flavorful, lots of veggies, and good portion of quality beef. They also have great service and reasonable prices. Best I've found in Phoenix, looking forward to going back and trying some of their other things.

Originally booked a room for 3 night in which I was given the "special" rate because I was there as part of a wedding. A week later added a 4th night and told them that according to the web site's standard rates the 4th night now offered a 35% discount which was cheaper than the "special" rate and was told it would be taken care of. Didn't think twice about it until I checked out and saw that I still had the higher, "special" rate. Contacted reservations, eventually speaking to a supervisor, Karen, who informed me that I had signed a paper when I arrived that had the "special" rate on it so I was obligated to pay that rate. When I arrived no one reviewed the rate with me, maybe because there was a line and they were in a rush, I don't know. I shouldn't have signed it without reading it more carefully, but I didn't think I was getting taken advantage of and I thought the rate adjustment was taken care of already.   To top it off I found someone else's tow nail clippings on the carpet in the middle of the room the second night there. Seems they didn't vacuum before I arrived, or even the day after.   Pool was nice, bed was comfortable, TV reception sucked, room and bathroom was big, towels felt like sand paper, parking was terrible, food was good but pricey even for that place. Wedding was done well and that experience was nice.   Room was pricey, then they added a $22/night resort fee, then they taxed both of them at over 12% adding another almost $14/night.   I wouldn't recommend to anyone just because of the way they handled my rate, both before and after the fact.

Pros: Location, staff, has kitchen  Cons: Smell, cleanliness, photos misrepresent age of unit  Did my reservation through hotels.com an picked the place because of the photos, price and reviews, however was very disappointed with the smell and cleanliness of the unit. Found a dead cockroach under the kitchen sink, stains on the comforter, and clumps of someone elses hair in the towels. It was so disturbing that I canceled the reservation early and moved to another hotel. I will say the staff was very friendly and understanding of the situation and waived the cancellation policy.

Found this while looking for a quick, healthy, and reasonably priced place to grab dinner. That's exactly what I found, the price is decent and the food was definitely geared to toward the healthy side, and there isn't much of that around that area. Salads were fresh with plenty of options to choose from. Will certainly be going back there when I'm back in Phoenix.
