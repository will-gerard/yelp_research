My favorite downtown place for Mexican food! The guacamole tostada and red chili burro enchilada style are both absolutely delicious.

In the world of bowling alleys, this one is great. We went as part of a large birthday party on a Saturday night. Given that half the group was intoxicated, the staff was incredibly patient with dumb people having fun bowling. It's a good price for the Extreme bowling. But what impressed me the most is that the place is sparkling clean.

5 stars for the bean and cheese burrito!!! This dive is nothing fancy, but the bean and cheese burrito is delicious and the red hot sauce is amazing! My hubbie likes the chorizo, but any of the breakfast burritos will do. My one hesitation about the food here is the enchilada sauce, it's from a can and not very good. Otherwise, go eat and enjoy!

The liquor store has a great selection and the staff is very knowledgable. But the real gem here is the wine cellar. You can purchase any bottle there and enjoy it in the cellar. If you don't like wine, they have beer on tap too. It's under new management too, so now there is food available. The bartendars are always friendly and full of suggestions too. It's a really neat area with plenty of tables and couches hidden even further in the back. Enjoy the added bonus of no cell phone reception to fully participate in a conversation or lose yourself in a good book.

Dr. Abbott is very kind and patient. His humor makes a routine visit entertaining. I've been going to him for years. He's got a great selection of glasses and most contacts are in stock.

If all you want is pizza, this is the place. I like the buffalo chicken pizza best and the rest of them are good too The pizza rolls aren't too shabby either. I also love the ease of the drive through and that I can place an order on my way home from work and not have to get out of my car.  That being said, the rest of the menu is way overpriced for the quality. The Italian Beef sandwich was pretty weak. It tasted like a frozen beef  that was reheated with a ridiculous amount of mozzarella cheese on it. I expected better. The same can be said of the meatball sandwich. And the marinara sauce is way too sweet for my liking.

As a former Illinoian, this is a pretty good place to watch a Bear's game and enjoy some classic Chicago sandwiches. The Italian sandwich is super spicy and delicious and the au jus sauce was authentic. The baked beans were sweet, but soupy. Fries were freshly cut and Chicago style greasy goodness. My personal fav is the Beef Brisket sandwich with spicy BBQ sauce. It's perfectly cooked and the juices just soak into the bun.  The service was friendly and there are plenty of TVs to catch all the action. We'll definitely be back for more!

Cheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeese!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Get the English Sausage Rolls and side of cheese! Too die for!   I'm hesitant to give it 5 stars for fear that word will get out about the gem of a dive bar. I've never been disappointed by any of the food or drinks we've gotten there. We go regularly for happy hour or late night hangouts. The bartenders are always friendly and they work hard to earn those tips for sure. It's never very crowded and the regulars are a hoot.

I love the food here and the beer specialities are always fun. Prices are reasonable for the quality of food. It's definately got a good vibe and there's always a crowd.   The patio area is really nice. But a word of caution, if you eat outdoors, be prepared to be swarmed by flies. We ended up moving inside after a few bites because they were all over us once the food arrived.  The inside is nice but it's a tight squeeze. The decor cracks me up. I feel like everytime I go there I find a new sign to read or notice a new picture. The staff is great and the bartendars keep up the pace to get the drinks served quickly.

Fun bar that was willing to put on a soccer game for me, despite NBA playoffs being on. The food is really good, especially for a sports bar. Order the buffalo chicken wrap, you won't be disappointed.

I went there before an Illini b-ball game. It's crazy busy on game day, so get there early and put your pizza order in while you wait for a table if you want to save some time. The thick crust takes about 40 minutes to bake and if there's a line already, expect your order to take about an hour and quarter. So, it's nice to place the order ahead of time, grab some drinks at the bar, and then get seated with about 20 minutes left to wait for your pizza. Staff is super friendly.  Now for the food... the other reviews don't lie. It's delicious. I like Chicago deep dish and this is some of the best I've ever had. The dough is fantastic and the cheese is melted perfectly. They have a great selection of toppings to build your own pie and it's not too pricy.

My husband surprised me with an anniversary dinner at Durant's. We had a really nice time. I love the throwback vibe of the place and the walk through the kitchen to get inside. I could do without complimentary valet, but that's just me. The kitchen staff happily greeted us and the wait staff was also very friendly.   They have a great selection of wine that compliments the food.We ordered scallops for an appetizerand they were cooked perfectly! My husband had the Delmonico and I enjoyed a medium rare Filet. Both were cooked exactly how we ordered it and both tasted delicious. The stuffed baked potato is worth every single calorie and then some!  The wait staff gave us a complimentary dessert to celebrate our anniversary and we went with the Strawberry Shortcake. It was huge! The angel cake was perfectly fluffy and the strawberries were sweet and ripe.

Delicious New Mexican cuisine! They don't do mild.   The staff is friendly and will keep you glass full, but beware that it's not the quickest service. This is definately a place to go and unwind and take your time eating.  Food- I've never had anything I didn't like here. The adovada ribs are great and ridiculously hot. But my personal fav, is the spicy guacamole, made fresh and guaranteed to make you sweat. The red chili burro enchilada style another hit out of the ballpark. They used to have a great green chili stew, but sadly it's was a limited time menu item.

The taqueria is the place to go. It's fast and pretty good. I'm a HUGE fan of the veggie burrito and chipotle potatoes. Both are to die for! That being said, the rest of the menu is good, but nothing spectacular. The service is hit or miss, but the veggie burro is completely worth it.

I was unimpressed. I've heard great things about this place, but perhaps the hype made me expect more. I went with a girlfriend for a Saturday brunch. We sat outside and that patio area is as nice as a patio facing a parking lot can be. We split an order of eggs benedict with potatoes and the Morning Glory omelet with fruit. The eggs benedict was standard. The omelet was okay, but I've had better in much smaller establishments. For the price we paid, I expected better.

I've gone a couple times and always enjoyed myself. They have two types of theaters, one for only over the age of 21 and the other is for over the age of 18 or with an adult's presence. I've only ever gone to the the one for adults only. The seats are very comfortable and the servers do a nice job bringing food and drinks, but still staying out of the way of the viewing audience.  The food is really good. I'm a huge fan of the macaroni and cheese. It's got grilled chicken and comes with a piece of pretzel bread that's doughy and perfect to dip in left over cheese sauce. My husband likes the jalepeno burger, jalepenos are diced into the meat and fried jalepenos are served on top of it. There is a bar in the front of the theater and the drinks are really good too.  Parking for the Esplanade is validated for up to 4 hours and is easy enough to get in and out of.

I love this place for the breakfast burritos, but everything is on the menu is delicious. The food is authentic and the red sauce is perfect amounts of spicy. It's a good place for a great lunch with friends or grabbing some quick breakfast on the way to work.

Plenty of chain restaurants and bars to keep people entertained for pre- or post- fun when going to the Jobing.com Arena or UoP Stadium. There is a spot on the west side of the City Center where all the scalpers hang out, off the sidewalk by the parking lot. We've gotten some good tickets pretty cheap from them.  I like hanging out at one of the restaurants or bars after a game and wait out the traffic. The nearby Yardhouse is my personal fav for the selection of beers, don't expect any place in that area to have cheap drinks on a game day. I'm not sure about other days though.

I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! The seafood is very fresh, I'm not quite sure how they do that. The crab cakes are to die for. They put crawfish in them and the sauce is d'lish. I love the plank salmon too, but I recently discovered the pasta mardi gras (seafood pasta). I'm usually not a fan of seafood pastas because they taste so fishy, but this was really good. I've never had anything less than great here and each time I go I try something new.  The drinks are good, but the speciality drinks are pretty weak. If you want a good strong drink, order a mixer. On the weekends they usually have live music on the patio, which is usually jazz or blues. It makes waiting for a table all the easier for sure. They do take reservations though, so if you don't want to wait an hour, call ahead.  If you go all out on the meal (appetizer, drinks, and dessert), for two people, you can expect it will easily be over $100. Worth it! Though we usually save it for special occasions.

This is one of my favorite happy hour spots. Beer and sushi at a smokin' deal and the bartenders are always friendly. Be warned there are some regulars that will steal the attention from the bartender and create a bit of a wait on service, but the friendly service easily makes up for it.  I started with the Cucumber Mojito and was impressed with how good it was. I'm usually not a Mojito fan, but a friend convinced me to try it. It will now be my drink of choice at Kabuki. We split a few rolls and loved them all, especially the Tempura California Roll. It's a must eat.

Delicious! This is my favorite spot of sandwiches downtown. It's a NY style deli and they aren't afraid to broadcast it. They use boar's head deli meat and there is no skimping on proportions. The hoaggie bread is perfectly soft with sesame seeds on top, but they have other options if you want to be "healthy." There is a strong battle in my heart of Ms. Rachel vs. Mr. Ruben when comes to selection time, but the buffalo chicken wrap makes a good lunch too. The side dishes are pretty good too, but I hardly ever have room for it.  It's totally worth the hassle of limited parking and downtown madness to stay full all day.

It's a good happy hour after a long day at work to wait out the traffic mess. The bartenders are very friendly and the cocktails are delicious. Great selection of beer too. But my favorite thing about it is the old movies that play (with no sound) in the background. Nothing like watching a really bad japanese monster film and while enjoying a good drink.  Parking can be a mess depending on when you go. You can go in on 7th avenue side or up the fire escape staircase to get in. Either way, it's a cool bar with a good vibe.

A fancy hot pocket made with fresh ingredients in a wide selection of choices. They don't do custom orders, your pasty comes as is. I've tried a bulk of them, but the cajun chicken continues to be my fav, it's just spicy enough. Sunday is all day happy hour and the beer selection is pretty nice too. I only wish they had a hostess, almost every time I go there, I've been sat at a table that had more people coming so my group wouldn't fit.

This location is one of the better 24 Hours in the valley. Most of the equipment works and the gym lockers are pretty nice too.   The TVs are good size and most of the headphone jacks work. The staff refuses to change channels though and just gives exercisers the remote. The remote does not work easily and I spent about 5 minutes trying to change a channel.  Update: Izzy's body combat classes on Saturdays and Mondays are the best workout ever!!!

The salesman, Will, was great. He was very easy going and knew plenty about the car we test drove. Unfortunately, his sales manager, Cassidy, was incredibly pushy and refused to give us a price on the car. He kept asking what our budget would allow and when we responded by asking what the best he could was, he wouldn't budge from the sticker price. That is, until we started walking out, then he started yelling after us to come back and we could "finally talk." It's ashame really. Car buying should not be so frustrating.

Bring your own food, grab a fantastic beer, and enjoy the company of friends and friendly bartendars. They've got a great selection of beers on tap and even more in the fridge! There's a good selection of wine too. There's no pressure to drink quickly or leave tables, just sit back and unwind after a long day.  My biggest downside... the oodles of college kids that haven't learned how to handle their drink yet.

Holy awesome dog park, Batman! This place is great! My dog is super friendly, but doesn't know how to play. He just stands and watches usually. But, with all the other dogs running up to great him, he was acting like a puppy and getting in on the action. The other dog owners are incredibly friendly and they all know how to control their dogs. There is plenty of lighting and tons of open space. There is even a "timid dog area" off to the side for dogs that is perfect for a dog not used to the bark park.  Other aspects of the park include a people park with slides and swings, soccer fields, baseball fields, and plenty of open space. It's all very well maintained and over a beautiful area.

We went on a Friday night to watch our friend's band play. Food is good, but standard bar food so don't expect fine dining.  The vibe is great though and makes this dive bar worth going to again and again. The live music plays regularly and the bartenders keep your glass (or can depending on what your drinking) full. I think my favorite thing about the bar is the Nintendo decor throughout and the game console hookup near the back room. If you're looking for a low-key evening with good music, keep this place in mind.

This would be a 5-star review if they served beer. I love the Italian Stalian pizza; it's delicious! The spicy pizza sauce has just the right kick of heat. I also really enjoyed the crust; it had a seasoning to it as well.We took home the leftovers and they tasted great the next day too!  The bad news, they no longer serve Sausage Smackers, which is a real shame because they give the pizzeria something all it's own. The side salad is just that, nothing too fancy.  Overall, this is a great place for food, but get it to go if you want to enjoy a nice cool drink with it.

Hands down, best donuts in the valley. All the locations are great. Most are open 24 - 7 and the flavor is fantastic. It's a great pickup for a morning office meeting or an even better late night snack after a night of fun. My personal fav is the pink icing with sprinkles, although the caramel long john is quickly catching up. I could go there every day.

Everything in this truck is amazing, but I tip my hat to the Bear Dog. Peanut butter, cracker jacks, bacon, cheese, and bbq sauce on a hot dog somehow works fabulously.   Each hotdog is named after a customer's dog and every week they feature a new dog of the week. Someday I'll submit one named for my dog too.    Side note, the fried pickles are pretty amazing too.

It's nothing fancy, but I'm a huge fan. Lots of TVs that the staff will gladly change to accommodate a sports fan. One of the few places in the valley that will show soccer games without being asked too.  The staff is super friendly and know how to have a good time too. It's definately a good place to be a regular at, but they treat the first-timers just as good.  For a sports bar, the food is super good. I'm a huge fan of the mac n cheese and I ask for some Habenaro paste in it just for the added heat. So good! The green chile burger is another yummy choice. And if you're ever in the mood for beer and wings, you're completely in luck!

This is a cool place and it's always a good time. We went for a soccer game this time around, but have gone before for other events. They show all the big soccer games here and it was great cheering on Team USA with a lot of supports. I've gone to other shows as well and really enjoyed the throw-back 80 films or a new independent on the big screen.  The beer selction is pretty impressive. Any place that has Orange Blossom AND White Chocolate Ale is a winner in my book. It's also a big supporter of Four Peaks beer, even some of the seasonal stuff. Nothing like catching a good show with a cold beer!

The food is okay, best thing on the menu is easily the Wachos (nacho style waffle fries). It's a solid bar with plenty on tap and good selection of mixed drinks. The service is spotty though.  There are plenty of televisions and the staff is pretty good about changing the channel to a good game. The pool tables aren't cheap, but make for a fun night. They also have a shuffle board table to spend a couple of hours.

One of the few spots I can take my hubby (who hates Sushi restaurants) and we can both enjoy a meal. He can get his made exactly how he wants it and I can do the same. I don't think I've built the same roll twice in the times I've gone there. The veggies are fresh and the seafood is pretty good too, especially for being in the middle of the desert. They've got both seaweed and soy wraps, which is great. They also make the rolls wrap side out, instead of the traditional rice out way of sushi.  The parking situation is awful. There is never enough spaces and I've circled the lot for up to ten minutes waiting for a spot. Great news is that they deliver now so you can avoid to horrific parking. I also love ordering ahead of time online so I can skip the line and enjoy my meal.

Ten minutes to perfect eyebrows and no damage to my skin? Yes, please! This is a great threading place. I've gone multiple times and each time it's been a good a experience. I've had different women do my eyebrows and they are all perfectionists.  It's hidden in it's location underneath the Cadillac Ranch, and there is seldom a wait.  They offer eyebrow, lip, chin, and full face services. They also have a punch program so after 12 sessions, you'll earn a free one.

Fantastic service on a Saturday morning brunch! I had the biscuits and beer chorizo gravy. It had a nice kick and tasted delicious. My friend got a panini with a side of potatoes which were  also pretty amazing. Toss in some fresh squeezed orange juice and I'm a happy customer. Ambiance is nice. Outdoor patio is well shaded, but beware sitting by the flowers, there are lots of flies.

It's a cute cafe with a great location in downtown. Parking can be a bit of a beast depending on what's going on at the Market, but there's always a space to be found if you're patient. It's a welcoming atmosphere and I love the flowers for sale.   The food is very good. The group I went with all ordered something different and tried each other's items. The pork chili pot pie is the way to go, it's got a good taste and consistency of spice to it. The Flanched Flarney Garney (egg sandwich) was good, but it would be amazing if they would change the bread from a hamburger bun to toast. It was way to bready with the bun, I ended up eating the sandwich sans bun.  Check in with yelp and get a free cookie. I got a s'more cookie. It was absolutely delicious and stole the show for the meal.

Small cafe admist all the highrises in Uptown. Good selection of food for breakfast, lunch, and snacks. The service is super friendly too. They've got other things you may need in the office if you forgot something at home.   The 4 stars for me came from the Watermelon Nectar though. It is incredibly refreshing on a hot day. It's watermelon juice, coconut water, mint, and nectar. Also, checking in will get you a free scope of ice cream which I'm always a fan of. They had a good selection of ice cream to choose from too so it actually made for a tough decision.

It's about time that Steak N Shake came to the valley. I LOVE the frisco melt, it's crazy greasy deliciousness. The place is clean and the service is friendly, which to be honest, feels weird when I'm used to a surly waitress giving me the stink eye when I order my food at this chain.    I wish they'd stay open 24 hours like standard Steak N Shakes, but ah well. I don't mind the smaller menu, but I do mind that they do not have the peppers. They are missing some key elements that dispite the smaller menu they could do better.  I agree with a fellow reviewer that the milkshakes are not Steak N Shake quality. However, I'm willing to overlook all of that for my Frisco melt with fries and a side of cheese sauce.
