AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE.  I came to this location at the end of the day to meet a friend for a quick bite.  I love rubios fish tacos but these had an awkward taste of funky grease.  I notified the gal behind the counter -  they were more than happy to replace the item with some chicken tacos with out question.  I'm usually not one to send food back - but when I might get sick I'll comment .  Thanks guys for making a possible bad experience an amazing one.

Amazingly friendly staff.  After wasting time and money on Amazon - I found the canes I needed right here at easleys for cheaper than any Amazon deal!  I'll just skip the trouble next time - they have EVERYTHING

Superb service!  First off, let me say that I work in high end sales and service industry, so I certainly appreciate great service when I see it.  I was greeted by every member of staff from the garage tech that passed me on the way in, to the gentleman at the counter who acknowledged me Instantly and affirmed that he'd be happy to help me shortly- as he was finishing up with another customer.  Every staff member was friendly and welcoming and had a pleasant demeanor. my service specialist went above and beyond to sort finances.   On top of wonderful people the repair made to my "big-o" tire was free.  I will definitely be purchasing my tires here -

Miles is amazing!!!! I have had probably 6-8 screen replacements over the years of iPhones.   Additionally, miles has fixed power buttons , main buttons-   Any issues that I've had with my phone.  His convenient in car service fits well with my busy life.  He's been to my places of work and home -   Always has given a prep call to let me know he was on way and very on time!  Not to mention-   Highly personable --- AWESOME GUY!

Awe ... I've loved bliss for years -  came in tonight for my delicious bliss burger-  still great food but sad to see that they are nickel and dime-ing for sides of sauce, aioli, etc etc.  even a 1.00 charge for a tall cocktail.  (4 up charges on one burger and one drink) Next do i have to pay for the use of a glass?  Sorry bliss-  still love you! But would love you more if you just charged a fair rate and left it at that. Thank goodness the food is great!

I went to Ink therapy for a commemorative tattoo and was seriously unsatisfied.  A friend has gotten two tattoos from the artist Derek and I enjoyed the color and overall tattoos.  I decided to use him as my artist for this very special tattoo (this is my 7th).  Derek was extremely unprofessional with personal medical information and charged me more for my tattoo based on the circumstance.  The coloring of the tattoo was not what I wanted- I wanted an outlined piece with shading inside.  I received a quick work up with a mag and little highlights on the tips.  This tattoo scabbed worse than any of my large full colored ones and the spots that have healed are more dull than ones that I've had for years.  Overall terrible experience, will not be returning to this shop.
