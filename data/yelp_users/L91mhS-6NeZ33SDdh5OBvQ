The White Pizza is a must try!! It's one of the restaurant's customer favorites and it tastes amazing. The pizza has chicken, bacon, cheese, arugala, and an amazing garlic parmesan buttery sauce. It wasn't too rich at all and is something I've never tried before. Unfortunately I can't really say the same thing for their Hollywood Cobb salad which was very mediocre and nothing mind blowing. The atmosphere is great and is somewhere you can just sort of hang out. It has a relaxed feel to it and I really like the lighting and simple interior design. For a simple and fun date I recommend this place for the single guys out there. It's a loud and busy place but not to the point where you can't hear each other talking. Also, their red velvet cake is really good. The moist cake and the delectable cream cheese frosting blend together nicely to make a perfectly sweet dessert.

To start off, I'm originally from San Diego so my standards for Mexican Food are very high. When I first went here I ordered a Carne Asada burrito with lettuce, tomatoes, and guacamole. I think this is a pretty simple burrito that doesn't really have a lot of room for error.  Upon first biting into the burrito I thought it tasted good: the meat wasn't dry and was tasty, and the vegetables inside were fresh. The only problem I had was the guacamole. I didn't see any in my burrito so I went up to the counter and asked them if they forgot the guacamole and they said they didn't. I told them I didn't see any and asked for extra. They went to go get some guacamole and came back with a cup of green liquid that I assume was either blended avocado or the powder type you mix with water. Even though this is not the type of guacamole I'm used to I still gave it a chance and poured it into my burrito (pouring guacamole into a burrito sounds very wrong by the way...). I still tasted nothing! I have never been to a Mexican restaurant where the guacamole tastes like nothing and is in liquid form! I don't understand why they don't use real guacamole in their burritos but if they do I'm sure I would probably give the place 3 or 4 stars.   I think I'm very fair and I decided to give this place another chance and asked to have REAL guacamole put in the burrito because I know if you order chips and guacamole it's the real type (chunky not liquid). Once again, I was disappointed. So apparently this place doesn't believe in using actual guacamole in their burritos. So sad...  Some positives: somewhat cheap and close to ATSU if you're a student there. Other than that, I don't think it's worth the money. I mean even Rubio's has real guacamole in their burritos. If you're not used to good Mexican food or you don't care what your food tastes like then go here.

This is my favorite Starbucks near me mainly because of the drive thru. It is soooo convenient when you can roll out of bed and just drive in your PJs to get your daily caffeine fix. I've never encountered a really long wait at the drive thru so the workers there are pretty efficient. They're also really nice and will make small talk with you if it's taking a little longer than usual to get your drink. The only downside to the drive thru is that their entire menu isn't presented to you. It's just a few things listed on there. So you kind of have to know your drink or what you want to get if it's not listed on the menu in the drive thru.
