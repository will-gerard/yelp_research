We were looking for Richardson's, and parked where it used to be.  I know they reopened after burning down a few years ago, and I've been looking forward to the garlic plate for a long time.  Turns out Richardson's was about 3-4 blocks up on 16th street, not at the corner in the strip where it used to be.  We ended up just going into Dick's, since it's all owned by the same family.  And parking is tough there, we didn't want to move from the parking spot we were lucky enough to score!  I've never been inside before but it was perfect for us, very cozy and intimate.  We were just stopping in for a light lunch on our way to our staycation.  We got the half garlic plate and the skewers.  It's not a lot of food but oh my God, how delicious it is.  I wish we got the full garlic plate.  The elephant cloves were smooth and creamy and the perfect base to the peppers and cheese that we piled on to our baguette bread slices.  The skewers were delish--they came with a shrimp, a sausage, a beef and a chicken (I think?) and the salsas and sauces all complemented them very well.  Not a cheap place but very much worth it for a special occasion.

Every one of the staff there was warm, compassionate and made me feel comfortable leaving my dog for 24 hrs in their care.  I wasn't going to ask, but I didn't have to: they offered to bring Fiona to me so I could say goodnight to her before leaving. I'd recommend this emergency clinic to anyone in the southwest valley.

This place is ridiculously delicious.  I'd recommend it for larger dinner parties, only because it's nice to be able to sample the variety of dishes they have.  The menu is extensive.  We had six tapas dishes (my husband and me) and would've kept going except that since we were forced to eat slowly and in small portions, we actually did get full after a while.  We had spanish meatballs, an eggplant crab tart (our least favorite and we really liked it), an open faced empanada, a leek puff pastry (incredible) tenderloin skewers, and the ham and cheese croquettes.  Everything was delicious.  We wished that the plates had an equal number of items for splitting and sharing purposes.  Maybe the dishes could have had a little more food on them.  Overall, though, we truly enjoyed our experience.  Our server was great, the ambiance inside was very comfortable.  I'd definitely go back with a group.

Excellent job!  On time. Super thorough.  Efficient. Friendly. All the five star ratings below are legit.  I've noticed a drastic reduction in dust around the house too.

Looking forward to coming back again and again.  My husband and I shared two carne asada tacos and two carnitas tacos.  They were both really really good, very fresh.  The salsa bar had a great variety of salsas that we couldn't decide on, so we sampled all of them!  By far tho, I loved the salsa that came with the chips.

David is knowledgable, professional thorough and extremely patient. Especially with me, someone who obsesses over bugs both in and outside my house.  He's done a great job keeping the critters out and offered suggestions on how to stave off certain pests.  He guarantees his work and would come back if problems should arise but we've never had a problem.  I'd definitely recommend him!

Totally disappointed in the quality of their nachos. Their freshly made tortilla chips and salsa make this truck a 4 to 5 star establishment. The chips they serve as nachos are anything but fresh and homemade. They're cheap round chips that you can get from the dollar store. And within minutes they don't even resemble chips, as they turn into mush. Especially when they're slathered with gooey processed cheese sauce. Step up your nacho game and use the chips you actually make; THEN they'd be worth the $8.50!!
