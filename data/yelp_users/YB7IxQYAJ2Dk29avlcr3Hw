After writing my first review the customer service management sent a voucher to retry the food. We went for dinner this time. The pizza was actually really good. I think better then pizza bianca.  The service still sucked. When we walked in the girls were all talking. After a few minutes I had to interrupt and ask if we just sit anywhere.  The seats and table were dirty.

My husband and I actually like Dr Roso but not his admin staff. We received a $20 no show appointment fee. The appointment was made the same day and we came in 2 hours later. I left a message for the billing department (since they don't answer the phone) with no response. Then I get a letter saying I have to pay a $5 collection fee and my $25 is being sent to collections, wtf!?

The first time we went there the food was good but the service was weird. The hostess who was also our server was wearing a see through outfit that showed her underwear. I personally don't care but I do think it's weird for an upscale restaurant.   The second time we went there, the food was good and the service was good. We just noticed the drinks were crazy expensive. I'm pregnant so I got a drink without alcohol and it was still $8. I think it's unnecessary which is why I am giving them 4 stars.

The last and final time we there, they were out of half their menu and couldn't make half the drinks on their menu. For a change, the service was actually not that bad but she had to go next door to get change for our bill.

I changed a reservation at the counter but the guy didn't save it. My husband spent 3 hours in the morning trying to find the car we needed since we were going camping. We only got the car from another branch because he was so mad, he was told to just go home and wait for a call. We got one free day because of all the drama. Then we got into an accident (had paid for insurance) and during the return they never bothered to forward our insurance / claim information to their own claims department. If we hadn't made copies of everything enterprises claims dept would be changing us for all the damage costs.

What is going on Enterprise?!?! No response to the email you requested from me. Now your claims department is calling me demanding that I call the insurance company that WE BOUGHT THROUGH ENTERPRISE and tell them to send you a claims payment. How am I suppose to do that?? First of all, I don't speak Spanish. Secondly, it's insurance that we bought THROUGH ENTERPRISE so we wouldn't be liable for any damages. NOW, you are telling us we have to pay the full damage cost or you will send it to collections???

The atmosphere is great! The coffee isn't the best in Phoenix but it's not bad. It's the best coffee we have found outside of Central Phoenix.  I thought the staff was nice and friendly. They seemed like local kids.  The food was decent. It was a little bit oily but not bad.

Do not sign up for 1 year, try it out for 1 month first. We didn't end up moving to Scottsdale and I never even picked up the mailbox keys. They wouldn't refund me the 10 months I had remaining on the contract. Plus no one would call me back for days.

This is my favorite breakfast spot in Phoenix! The pastries are always made fresh and on busy days they will sometimes run out.   The staff is all nice. You order your food at the counter and then they bring it to you.

This is a steroid friendly gym. If you are looking for a relaxed neighborhood workout spot or you are female this is not a good place to go. I was there a few days ago and sat down three mats away from a walking advertisement for steroid abuse. He demanded I move right next to someone else because friends of his were coming to the gym. Not wanting to workout shoulder to shoulder with someone else when there was plenty of space available I told him I would move when his friends showed up (they weren't even at the gym and probably did not exist). This enraged him and he got up and kicked a workout ball at my head.  On the way out I complained to the front desk. The guy acted like it was my problem. The roid user came over and started screaming at me that he was going to hurt me and to go outside and fight him. The desk guy knew the other guy and was talking to him by first name and openly sneering at me. I saw the same front desk guy today and asked if he spoke to the guy about his behavior. Again he was rude and pretended for the first two minutes not to remember what happened! Then he said he didn't know the guy at all despite calling him repeatedly by his first name and then he said something about how he weighed 315 pounds. The implication was that I better do what he said. There are a lot of gyms around this one is not worth your time or money.
