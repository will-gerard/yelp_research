We really enjoyed the Van Gogh Live presentation they have of his paintings this month. Other then that, I really do not care too much about this place. I actually find the AZ Science Center as one big headache. Lots of walking around...for nothing really. Yeah, this is how electricity is made they tell you but if that's not your thing...you will be bored.

I have been seen by the Nurse Practitioner Christa and Dr. Laura Kimbro so far. Both experieces have been good. They are really good about following up with you. They can do ultrasounds right in the office if your insurance covers it.  They do all their baby deliveries at Banner Desert.  One small complaint...they take the whole thanksgiving weekend off. Although there is someone always on call, it would be nice if they were open that friday.

As good as it gets, only when it is cool and beautiful weather. Been here twice. Once when it was sweltering hot. Did not enjoy the botanical gardens so much then. I also went for the Chihuly exhibit recently and it was beautiful and fun.   They have so many different types of cacti. Check it out. Take your out of town guests here e.t.c. But remember, only when it is cool weather!

I have been to the Phoenix Zoo twice now. The first time was 3 weeks ago in 104 degree temp. Awful experience. We only went around the big animals side so my kid could see them. All the animals were tired, hot and sleeping. They looked miserable and we were miserable too. The water mists did not help one bit.  We also went this past weekend when the temperature was a high of 76 degrees. Heaven!!! Loved the zoo. Had so much fun. No need to rush. We just relaxed. All the kids were in a great mood. People were smiling, laughing, just having plain ol fun. The animals seemed alive and active. Just a beautiful experience. The Arizona Trail is great. It might have been good to go there with the hot temperatures as well. Some animals are hard to see because of the layout in the cages. The cages are smaller than needed for some of these large cats and other wild life. The Orangutans have a little baby Orangutan in it and he just hangs and plays while the big guys sleep. It was really cool. My favorite part is the giraffes. There were 5 of them this last time.

The zoo has done lots and lots of improvements and is a really great place to visit and take the kids. The tiger and lion exhibits could be a lot better. There is a new orangutan baby currently at the new Orangutan exhibit. Love.   Best time to go is in the cooler months unless you take the bicycles that are provided and no kids to carry or push in stroller.

We go here a couple of times a month. The service is different then what you may be used to. What I mean by that is, some of the dishes will come first. Anytime husband orders Water Boiled fish, he always gets it last because I guess it takes them longer to make it. But, he enjoys the fried rice etc that we ordered until his stuff gets there. Its basically family style.   Their Vegetable fried rice is out of this world! Kids love the Shrimp LoMein. Husband loves the extra spicy water boiled fish. Just be prepared to have your whole mouth numb once you eat it.

Try the Dulche De Leche Milkshake. Yummm....  When we have lunch at the food court in Scottsdale Fashion Square, I do not get a drink with the lunch, instead I get the gazzilion calorie full Dulche Shake. Yummm...Yumm....  I could go on and on...lolz.

The scrambled eggs with croissant were good. Ambiance is non-existent. No french bakery feel at all. The products looked semi-appealing. Had a really hard time trying to find the damn place as it is hidden under a gargantuan office building. I would not by any means call this a "great" french bakery.

My review hasn't changed for the new place also. We got excited that they had moved to the new location and maybe had overhauled their offerings etc.   Although Pierre was a delight and very attentive when we were there, the products except for the chocolate croissants were lack luster. The pastries were dry and looked like they had been sitting in an improperly refrigerated box for who knows how long. The place itself has a very odd smell inside. Almost like a hint of gutters. This was on a Saturday afternoon.   I didn't realized how much the pastries and croissants had cost us until we went out to the car.   Go to Essence Bakery instead.

Great nursery. Friendly staff. I was in the market for roses, but the gentleman who worked there said that now is probably not the time to be shopping for them. He told me they get their roses in December and by mid January they should have a complete selection of them available. They get about 5500 plants each year and only 40 or so are not sold. Isn't that amazing? All these rose plants all over the city. What a nice picture in my head. haha...Anyway, they are selling the herbs and tomatoes there right now. Their website does provide some good info. Oh and according to their sign up front near the entrance: FEED YOUR CITRUS NOW!

They have all their roses in now. We got the Cecille Brunner Climbing Rose bush and the Jean La Joie. They look healthy and are already starting to leaf out. Can't wait to see the show of roses in a year. They have a huge selection available right now but are selling out like crazy. So go fast if you want roses for your garden. Ideal time to get them in the ground is now.

I love Paradise Bakeries everywhere else, except for this one. We stopped by for breakfast during the holiday season. The muffins were dry and tasted worse than the ones they give you on the flight, the tea was yuck and the croissant did not look or taste fresh. Have had better.   Will not be getting my future breakfast fixes here before a trip from Sky Harbor.

The drive up the mountain was narrow and dizzying. Will never go back here again because after the twists and turns of the drive, that are sharp, by the way, I was so dizzy and sick to my stomach. I almost wanted to paraglide back down because I was dreading the drive down the mountain. Mt. Lemmon in Tucson is much better. The views weren't that great either at South Montain. Waste of time. The directions online were confusing too. The road that it tells you to turn on is closed!!!! It is free though, so that was the good part.

I do not like their parking outside. It is hard to cross the median without almost getting run over by a Hummer or somethin'. It is crazy.  Anyway, the store itself is great. The associates are not as friendly as one would like them to be. They always seem to be busy doing nothing.   I will forever be grateful to BRU for their restroom and rest area specially created for moms who can change their babies diapers if code brown happens and they can breastfeed the baby in privacy. I don't think there is any other store out there who goes to such lenghts to cater to new mothers in such a way. Plus they provide you with diapers if you do not have your own. How nice. The sales could be better at BRU...and they need to do more coupons on their website but overall...this is a great place.   FYI, you can most likely find better prices at amazon.com on big ticket items such as strollers, car seats etc. Plus, the selection is limited at BRU.

I could just eat the bread and that would be enough to give this place 5 stars. Yumm. Typically we end up with the "Make your own pasta" option. Its pretty cool. Their garlic and olive oil sauce is really awesome. They call it Italian butter. This is not the most authentic italian food you will eat but it is a pretty close and darn good option for us Amreekans.   The service...aahh the service.  Service is always average at any Macaroni Grill that I have been to. Well its great sometimes which prompts us to give the waiter/waitress a 30% tip...whereas most other times it is average...when they end up with maybe a 7% tip.   If you go on your birtday, they will bring you out a free slice of cake with a lit candle in it and then sing you "Happy B'day" in opera style. It is a cool experience.   After you are done eating at Macaroni Grill...one thing is for sure. You will be full and satisfied. Just my kinda dinner.

These guys are always ready to help. Very courteous and professional staff. Recently my mom dropped her phone in water while visiting and we ended up going to Chandler Mall at the AT&T kiosk near the food court area. The girl there was not professional nor was she helpful. Just stared at us mostly as if she didn't care that she worked there. So, I explained we were going to go somewhere else and I remembered that the Ray Road AT&T always has what I need and are very courteous. Thankfully, mama had the same plan as moi, so worked out. We got her the best phone, the lady went through a ton of phones with us and made a recommendation. She showed us the most important part which was all the different colors the phones come in, giggles..~ and the rest of the staff worked on trying to transfer her info from the other phone to her new one...but alas~ the damage was too great for it to be recoverable.   One thing good to know is that this is an actual AT&T store, whereas the other kiosks like at the malls and such are only contract places. The Kiosk people might not know ALL the ins and outs of the services they offer. This store is large enough that they carry a majority of the products right on location whether it is a phone charger, or a headset e.t.c I will not hesitate going back to this place when I need another service or product.

The new setting is so much better. Lots more seating. The food and portions are good. The only thing I do not like about this place is the smell that comes from the trays on which they serve the food. They stink so awful and I almost gag whenever I sit down with it. I have to get up and get rid of the tray first before I can start eating. I know its minor, but it does put a very huge damper on the whole experience.   Good for groups. Will go here again but I am going to have to talk to the owners about their smelly trays.

Once in a while my family craves the Wendy's baked potato. We typically end up in this Wendy's drive-thru. Never, and I mean never is my order done correctly. Every single time if I get the Sour cream and Chives Baked Potato with shredded cheese, either the sour cream is missing, or the chives are non existent or they forget the shredded cheese. Today I even confirmed with the drive thru person in case he had forgotten yet again and he said he put the sour cream in there. Well, once we got home and opened the bag, the sour cream was missing. No butter either.   Although the manager was apologetic on the phone, it seemed like she knew what had happened from before hand. So, it must be a quality control issue which they should have fixed a long time ago.

Located in the same parking lot as Babies R Us, this is a must stop for any parent looking for new ideas for educational toys for their littleun's. This place was packed this past weekend but with back to school shopping being done by teachers and parents...totally understandable. Their aisles are seperated in subjects for e.g...Mathematics, Science, etc...and also by age group such as infant and toddler toys etc. Lots of stuff to find there for teachers. The prices are slightly high and the store is pretty small for all the things they have jam packed in there. I was expecting a much bigger store. I was looking for some stackable blocks for lil'un and the lady wasn't able to help much until I found them on my own.   They carry a bunch of stuff from the Mellissa and Doug line for kids toys. Also have a few musical instruments. This store is more geared towards parents then for little kids...very different from Brilliant Sky.

Cheap Dry cleaning. Only $1.95 per item. You get your items back in two days though, thus the 4 stars and not 5. Fast, simple. They are behind the Walgreens on the NW corner of 40th and Chandler Blvd.

Recently had a dreadful situation that I would really not like to think about but will go through the agony of it just for you. Yes, just for you my dear yelpers.   Well, my favorite Banana Republic shirt was mistakenly thrown in the washer and then the dryer instead of being sent to the dry cleaners. Aaaaarrggggh. I totally thought it was a complete loss when it came out. It was shrunk like you would not believe. Anyway, I took it to Legend Cleaners hoping they could do something. The lady checked to see what material it was. Turns out it is wool but I swear it feels like cotton. Anyway, she said they would try. When I got the shirt back, it was like it had never been through the washer and dryer. Whew. thank you Legend Cleaners!  Yay! I'm a fan.

Get the curries. Tried the Green Curry with Shrimp and it was really good. The Pad Thai was not that great. Maybe 3 stars for that. The Tom Yum soup was okay. 2.5 stars for that. I judge a Thai place by their Tom Yum Soup. If you can't even get that right, what else can you do? Hmm.. BUT, after I tried the green curry, i changed my mind about this place. It was delicious. They did not give us enough rice to go with the curry. Next time I will order more rice.   This was a take out order so I didn't actually eat there. I noticed there was only a mother daughter team eating there at 7:30pm on a friday night but there were abou 5 to 6 takeout orders waiting to be picked up. This place is much better than Swadees. It is small but clean. They also have outdoor seating. I like.

Oh, I so want to give you guys 5 stars...but I just can't. Just can't do it.!   I like this Phoenix Library but it has taken some getting used to. I truly miss my Tucson Libraries. Sigh~. I like the fact that you can put books on hold online and then they e-mail you once they are available to be picked up. The part I don't like is that they only allow 3 holds per patron so if your three books have a long hold time...you just keep waiting, and waiting and waiting. One more reason I like the Phoenix Library system is because they carry Hindi Bollywood Movies. hehehe... No need for Netflix baby. The part I don't like about the Ironwood Branch is how small it is. I always have to put stuff on hold because this particular location never has it available.   Now, for the minus 3 stars part. Its the freakin' librarians. Except for the lady who does our Babytime (she is super nice) the rest of the staff is bitchy. And now I put that lightly. They are super duper bitchy. The manager, Alice has never smiled ever all these years that i have been going here and is quite argumentative and bossy.  In the last year, they have had several jobs cut due to the budget and haven't replaced the people who left on maternity leave etc so they are a little overworked and probably under appreciated. Okay, whatever. What job out there doesn't fit THAT bill!   Anyway...when you ask a question to one of the people near checkout...they speak to you ask if you are deaf and in a condescending way. Its almost as if they are doing YOU a favor by working there...watever.I do plan on reminding them that my tax dollars pay for their job one of these days and that there are hundreds of people out there who would gladly take their job if they don't like working there... just wait.   One really bad feature about this particular branch is that they do not have any individual study rooms. Yeah...you read correctly. What dumb ass architect cam up with THAT idea? They have a large area in the middle with a bunch of tables and you study there while there are kids running around...people on the computer punching away, people coming to pick up their on hold books.

We loved this place. We went to the one in Scottsdale. The tom yum soup is awesome. Request it with only Shrimp!!!!!!!! Yummy. Also ask for medium spicy. It is yummy. They said they can make anything vegetarian if we wanted including without egg. How cool is that for any of my vegetarian friends!!!

They had a few aisles of kitchen cabinets priced anywhere from $500 through $2000 (the whole set). Some of them were pretty nice also. You can save a pretty penny if you want to make changes in your home by buying things from here for the renovations, updates etc. The store has a open warehouse feel to it. There was tons of stuff still in their boxes and looked brand new. It seemed that some people might have ordered wrong things etc and decided to donate it if it was non-refundable. Lots of indoor lightling, some plumbing fixtures, tons of sinks, toilets and tubs. The individual did say that sometimes they get things from Paradise Valley also and so does their Glendale store on Camelback. He also mentioned that the best day of the week to shop there was on Thursdays because that is when they get most of their things in.

The meat shop in the back offers some good selections for you. It is very convenient to pick up from their refrigerated section or if you have a special order of halal goat, or cut up chicken etc then you just go in the back and talk to the butcher who quickly prepares it for you. A lot of people also choose to order over the phone and pick it up.   We were so disappointed over the last few months with Baiz market for their meat selections and offerings(their halal ground beef is just gross, even the extra lean ground beef is awful )  that we finally made the switch to I-Mart after 5 years of exclusively purchasing our meat from Baiz originally. The meat and prices are incomparable to Baiz as I-Mart certainly offers a better selection in meat and their prices are slightly cheaper plus we don't have to deal with any attitude from the butchers like at Baiz. I am glad we finally found this place. They also carry a bunch of Indian and Pakistani spices, indian desserts, whole wheat flour from India etc.

Carries great indian vegetables. Has stuff from all over the world!! Awesome place! I have been able to find Okra, Opo Squash, the biggest Papaya's you have ever seen, amazingly sweet ripe mangoes during the summer season(they come from Mexico), the most fragrant and fresh mint, peeled and fresh garlic, amazingly fresh ginger and tons of other exotic stuff such as peeled coconuts which you can pierce your straw through and drink coconut juice/water. Lee Lee's has spices and food products from India, Pakistan, Korea, Japan, Phillipines, China and other countries. There is also an extensive fish market in the back. Do NOT let them fry your fish there. It stinks if you let them do it. Just come home and do your own thing. This place is packed on weekends so I try to go during the weekdays. They automatically give you 10% off the prices at the checkout counter. No membership card needed. There is no one who can help you in the aisles so if you have a question, forget it. You better know what you are there to buy. If you ask why they have discontinued carrying a particular vegetable at the front desk, they just argue with you that they still carry it but the truth is, it hasn' t been there for like 8 time that I have gone. Other then that, the veggie choices are just awesome. Everyone should visit this place at least once. If the smell bothers you, spray on a bunch of perfume/cologne before you go. haha..

Okay people! The mangoes are officially here! They sell like hotcakes so you better get there NOW! I bought a truckload last weekend and we have already finished eating all of them.  Last time I went, they did not have Red Snapper fish, but was able to get a Yellow Tailed Snapper and it turned out just as good.

I was completely disappointed by the level of service I received from this doctor and her office. Everything was done in a very hurried manner and nothing she talked about made sense. They also did not order proper tests like they should have for me and later I found out through my insurance company that the lab they sent  me to wasn't even covered through my insurance. I ended up paying hundreds out of pocket!!!  The office did not call me with my test results. I had to call twice. The nurse sounded like she did not know a thing about what I was talking about when I asked her a few questions.   The office looks clean but they do not do any blood work or other things here. You have to go someplace else to get it done.  I am changing doctors ASAP! (There are also some seriously scary reviews on other sites. Read them before you go here).

Great customer Service. Always greet you with a smile. They do the dry cleaning on premises so the chances of your things getting lost is zero. They even have a comparison chart in the store of other dry cleaners and how much they charge compared to Avalon that only charges $2.25 per item. For laundry they only charge $1.65 per item and they tell you that it will be cheaper to laundry e.t.c. They take checks and debit cards too. Debit cards has a surcharge of 50cents.

So we needed to fix up a couple of things on the roof per our home inspection when we bought the house. We had already asked for a quote from another company, but decided to get a second quote from Porter Roofing.   Dennis Porter showed up when he said he would to do the roof inspection which was for free. He gave us a quote which was 55% less than what the other guys had quoted us. It was a huge difference for us so we decided to have them do the work.   The workers arrived on time and did all the work professionally and were working the whole time on a hot summer day. When husband came home, he decided that he didn't like the way a strip of wood was placed under the edging of the roof just for aesthetic reasons so we called up Porter Roofing again and Randy the superintendent came over the very next day and let us know that he would get that fixed for us asap. The workers arrived again in a few days and fixed the issue. No extra charge.   We will use Porter again in the future if needed.   Few things you must know. When you call the office, if you get the office clerk, you might not get the same level of service from her as needed so best thing to do is go to their website and call Dennis on his cell phone directly. Randy the superintendent is very nice but is not good at calling you back to re-schedule etc. For example, he said he would call to let me know when the workers would show up again but he didn't. Either way, the workers showed up and the work was done but these are just a few things to keep in mind when dealing with them.

Did a take out order. That is how we normally eat jason's deli. This was my first time at this particular location...  This particular Jason's deli did not look as clean as others that I have been to. It was very disorganized and small. They were only slightly busy during lunch time which is surprising because all the other Jason's deli's are typically packed during this time. Their salad bar looked very small and unappealing.   The tuna melt was awesome. They serve it with chips and a pickle. We also got some mini cornbread muffins. They are really good! Really satisfies my craving for cornbread. Yumm...  Service was okay. Not everyone greets you. The takeout counter people were very nice.

I love Aveda! Well, I never shop there but recently I got an e-mail from their corporate office inviting me to try out some free samples. So, I took the e-mail and was helped by Anna.   She took the time to listen to my concerns, mainly my dry frizzy hair problems and she showed me a few hair products. But that was not it...she actually used some products on my hair, gave me a nice neck and upper back massage, and used some calming liquid on my neck. It was friggin' awesome. I want to go back just for that experience. I totally felt pampered.   I have used the samples I got from her and they are awesome too! Have you ever smelled their candle "Euphoric?" If you haven't you haven't lived baby! You will love the smell. Although I have not considered spending $25 dollars on a bottle of shampoo in like ten years, guess what...I am dying to go back to Aveda and buy their whole line!!! Best shopping, sampling experience at any retail store ever!

Great customer service!!  As soon as I entered the store, a clerk greeted me and asked if she could help. I told her that I needed some moving boxes. The service manager overheard me and walked me all the way to where the boxes were instead of just pointing me in a direction.    I picked out a few boxes and realized that they were too big for the cart. As I was struggling to put them in my cart, another associate appeared and offered to take the boxes for me to the checkout counter and they would hold them for me there while I shopped for other things.   I was really impressed by the customer service I received at this store. Lowes, you made my day!

If you are into gardening or would like to purchase plants that do not die in a few days, buy them from Lowe's. I loved the selection in plants they had. The people who work in the garden center were available to answer questions and they had a huge selection of flowers and also vegetables including bulbing onions etc.

This store is pretty big but I get the sense that it is less organized than its other counterparts. It is slightly darker than the other stores. The cashiers here are super nice and are very courteous. They answer all your questions with respect and it seems like the people here really enjoy working at this particular CVS. They even offer to do rainchecks if they run out of a particular item.  This particular CVS has a Minute Clinic inside the pharmacy. Helps out when you have the flu and can't get to the doctor. Minute Clinic is open on weekends as well.

So the actual Home Depot people are good to work with when ordering things but when a problem arises, they do not know how to handle things in a timely fashion.   We had several issues with our appliance delivery (more on that later, they use a really crappy delivery service called Barlows) and each one of the manager that we spoke to at Home Depot did not come through for several weeks. They kept trying to get another person to do the job instead of handling the problem themselves. I am really considering buying my future appliances through Lowes because of the issues I have had in getting things resolved.

Wow! I am completely blown away. So Home Depot contacts me via Yelp after reading my original review and asks for more info regarding the issue. They actually are looking into the issues to make their customer service more efficient in the future. I am very impressed that they actually took the time to contact me and and also offered a solution.  Its hard to find companies that will actually do any self reflecting like that. Thank you Home Depot.

For those of you who have given this restaurant a 5 star rating --- WHAT THE HECK WERE YOU THINKING!!!!! WERE YOU DRUNK?  The food was eeewww...their restrooms were even more eeeewwwww. I saw cockroaches near their kitchen and in the restrooms. The tables were dirty. The carpet looked like it has been there for 20 years...cough, cough.... The service by wait staff was courteous but our food took forever to come out. Tom Yum Soup tasted only like Chicken Broth. The shrimp in it was so bland...eeewwww. The fried rice had some dried out spots making me wonder how long it had  been sitting outside. The prices are way too high for the level of food that was served and apart from that, if  I am going to shell out $50+ for a 2 person dinner than it is expected that the ambiance of the restaurant be at least at the level of PF Changs e.t.c... Really bad experience.

Nothing new to add here. Their bread is awesome. He ended up getting the Mediterranean Style Mahi Mahi and I got the cheese quesadillas from the appetizer section with Shrimp and both dishes were awesome. Our little one also got the bread and bananas they bring out for children. This really helps a lot because they bring that small plate out for the kids right away so you don't end up getting a screaming devil at your table.    Of course when you go the Cheesecake Factory, how can you NOT get a cheesecake slice for dessert. We ended up with the Godiva cheesecake and it was amazing. Extremely rich and extremely fattening but who cares!

Now this is the shiznit!!!   Only walk into this store if you have an extra couple of hundred bucks hanging out in your pocket! You will want to buy EVERYTHING. They have gorgeous things displayed in a gorgeous way but you won't mind their steep prices because once you will enter the store, you will be in dream land and your sane mind will disappear.  One awesome thing that I liked about the Great Indoors is that when we were in the market to purchase a refrigerator, they were selling of a stainless steel Maytag model for 50% off only because it was a floor model. The fridge did not have any scratches or dents. It was perfect. We didn't buy at that time because hadn't closed on the house yet but the sales person Duane told us that occasionally they go through items and sell them at steep discounts to make room for newer models. If you are in the market to buy a particular appliance and don't care what brand it is, I would start here.

Although the service personnel are pretty professional here, my beef is with their security department. I have been followed each and every time I have visited this Nordstrom since December. And they are not discreet either. They will literally stand in front of me and stare as if to intimidate.  I am about to write a letter to the general manager.

We really like the food here. Their things are not your typical food that you find at an average eatery. This is a mecca for vegetarians and also for meat lovers alike. I am surprised by the average reviews for this place because this location is ALWAYS packed.  Food is always fresh, tastes awesome and even our lil'un loves their macaroni and cheese.  This place is not inside the food court but is infact right outside near Starbucks and BJ's.

We go to PF Changs at least once every couple of months. I have never been disappointed by their food. Their orange peel shrimp is the bomb. We like it extra spicy. You can ask for white and brown rice. The black pepper prawns served with the mustard sauce are amazing but are best eaten fresh right over there. They get all soggy if you do takeout. Have you ever eaten their desserts? Try the Great Wall of Chocolate. It is huge. One order is good for like 6 people. Or if you are a chocolate lover like me...maybe good for just one. Giggles...  The service is sometimes not up to par but eventually it all works out. Lately it hasn't been that busy when we go, even on weekends but it is always good to call about half an hour before you get there on weekend nights because you never know how long the wait is going to be.

They offer Sunday morning cooking classes! FREE! Go figure! And everything they make...which is usually three or more things...you get to sample and try out! It is awesome!   Love the store. The people are nice. Know their stuff and are very courteous. The sunday morning classes are done while you are standing around the cooking area and it does get pretty hot in there with the oven on and everythign...so if you can stand for a long time and don't mind the heat...go check it out.

Although they don't offer much in discounts, this place has knowledgeable and eager employees and owner to help with any questions, help you load things in the car etc and do seem to carry a wide assortment of grills and accessories along with books etc. I really like the Barbeques Galore charcoal that they offer. It is a big bag. Lasted us a long time and is slow burning. Will be frequenting this place often.

Been here for two years in a row. Total of three times. This year the peach crop where they had opened up the farm was very limited. The peaches were small and went bad the very next day. Then why the four stars? Its the experience people. We went a week after the peach festival. Last year we did the same but the peach crop was humongous and the peaches were awesome.   Picking fruit off the tree and stacking it in your little box they give you is such a cool experience. Visitors from out of town go wild with excitement when picking peaches and smiles are endless.   Great picture taking opportunities with your kids. The drive there has become a lot better as most of the construction is over with. The directions are pretty straight forward.   A few things good to know:  During the peach festival, there is a hayride that takes you to the peach trees and back. Its included in your entrance fee. Cannot remember what the entrance fee was. The peach festival is a good thing to do if the temperatures are going to be less than 97 degrees that day because the there is a lot of waiting in the sun etc when the hayride is involved. They do provide you with water coolers at their peach stations so you are covered in that department. Lots of dust out on the farm and during the hayride so not good for people with breathing problems.   If you do not go during the peach festival, the cool thing is, you can drive your car straight to the trees, the peach and apricot trees that is and start picking without walking too long of a distance.   The peach picking season is pretty short. Good to go during the earlier part of the picking season otherwise you will get sub par crops. Visitors, Do NOT carry the peaches back in your luggage through the airport as they will be crushed and made to pulp. Carry them in the box they give you and with lots of padding.

Our electrician suggested we go here to purchase a quieter fan because the one we got from Home Depot said it was quiet but turns out it is not.   Cappadonna's is pretty well stocked. They showed us a bunch of options. Most of them were above our price range so the customer service lady showed us some options through a catalog that were in our price range and ordered a fan we wanted. I think she went above and beyond to help us figure out what we wanted. Was not hesitant to help at all.   Will be doing more shopping here as time progresses.

This place is awesome. We bought a bicycle here. The staff was so knowledgeable and helpful. I even did a test run around the property on the bike which was great so I could decide if I didn't like something etc.   One thing we would have appreciated help on was putting the bicycle in our car. It was a tough one since we have a sedan and also a car seat, but we figured it out finally. Just wish someone would have come out and helped us.   They are way pricey than other places and I would not recommend getting your accessories from here unless you must of course.  Check out what you like there and then order it someplace else or wait for a sale or something.   You could drop some serious dough in this place. So tread lightly.

If you have a kid, you are going to need their services so I called a few places if they carried face painting supplies and they said no. Finally I called Arizona Fun Services and sure enough they said yes. When I got there they had tons of selections for face painting supplies. The lady patiently explained all the different options and price structures. We did end up getting a high quality but reasonably priced item and it has worked out great.  They are really easy to find. Just take the exit on to broadway west off of 101 and they are on the right hand side.  They carry costumes year round and also for little ones. I will be going back their for lil'un's halloween costume this year.

We've seen Dr. Pachtman for the last two years. He is a good doctor and pays attention to what he is doing. The office is very old and dingy looking. The wait can be long but they do try to keep things moving. Staff looks a little over worked. Rescheduling appointments is a nightmare.

Go here while the library is giving out the free passes every week. We've been twice in two weeks. The lil'un loves the dinosaurs, the gushing waterfall and the exploration play room made just for little kids to explore. They also all the kiddos and the grownup kiddos to pan for gold outside which is a huge hit with the lil'un. Oh, and its not real gold...so don't go running there... :-p  The admission passes if you have to pay can be a little steep. If you go on Saturdays, you might be able to catch the Mesa Farmers Market (Their last day is April 24th this spring and then they close for the summer) which is held within walking distance and is also a great way to stroll around and spend time with your family.

Eeww is all I could think of as I walked the halls of this school for a tour. Most of the classrooms did not have windows. All rooms were dark and dingy. The floors were dirty and the carpet old. The entire school was very quite and did not hear the normal chatter from little children. Not even from Pre-Schoolers. The playground for pre-schooers is a joke. Completely walled up.   The school might perform academically but I think at a high cost of the childs other development including social skills and physical development, being verbally expressive etc.

Really loved this place. The service was slow around 1:00pm on a Saturday. We were a party of 4 adults and 2 kids and the Veggie Combo for 3 was more than enough. Did have to order more Injera bread.   The veggies had such amazing and different flavors from each other. My favorite. Although their website advertises the gluten free injera, when we asked for it, they said they did not have any so our kid had to eat some rice instead.

Loved the food. The service was excellent and fast. I can't believe we waited so long to try this place. There is a nice grocery store inside and a restaurant section in a corner. The Baklava we purchased from here was really good too. Will go here again.

Fail! Fail! Fail!!!!!!!  Barlows, you suck. And you know it.  So you will have the unfortunate pleasure of dealing with Barlows when you buy an appliance from Home Depot because they deliver it. We ordered a stainless steel refrigerator and also a washer and dryer from Home Depot. Both had problems. Let me explain.  The stainless steel refrigerator came in with a huge dent in the front. It was obvious that the delivery personnel had done it while cutting the cardboard off the refrigerator before bringing it inside. So they call the office and the chick tries to talk me into taking a $75 credit so they didn't have to take it back. I was like hell no, I am not accepting a dented refrigerator. They backed down and said would replace the fridge in a few days and I could use the one they had just delivered until then. They also told me that they would not be able to attach the fridge to the water line because the valves were frozen. Didn't look frozen but they refused to touch it. Fine.  Then we get a washer and dryer delivery on a different day. The delivery people go check the connections and claim that the connections are frozen and they cannot attach the washer and dryer until they are replaced. Turns out that there had been some damage done by one of their colleagues at a different house and they were all becoming very nervous about any old valves in a house. So if you get a delivery from them, expect to pay hundreds of dollars to a handy man to replace the valves so these people can feel comfortable doing their job.   Anyway, they left the washer and dryer in the cardboard boxes that they came in inside the garage. We had our handyman change the valves right away and I gave Barlows a call so they could come back and install the washer and dryer. They never returned my call. I called back again and a chick goes, oh yeah, they are coming on so and so day. Well, it would have been nice if someone would have called me back.   Anyway, the people show up and they start putting the washer and dryer in. I go to check the thing after they are almost done and whoa#$%@@! the washer has two big scratches on the front. I was like, wait a minute, this is not acceptable. These are supposed to be brand new. Anyway, the delivery person says that he doesn't even wear a belt buckle so he didn't know where the scratches came from. He told me that the company would take care of it by either replacing the unit or could give me $75. I was like, okay, I will take the $75.   This is where it gets messy. His boss on the other end refuses to refund any money claiming that I was supposed to inspect the washer and dryers when they were delivered a few days ago and I had two days to return them if I wasn't satisfied. I explained that the machines were in their cardboard boxes and were NOT installed so there is no way I could have done the inspection. ALSO, the scratches were very fresh and they were done due to the delivery people not being careful so it wouldn't have mattered if I checked the washer and dryer when they arrived or after when they were installed. They also refused to take the washer and dryer back citing the same rule.   I complained to Home Depot and they agreed with my point of view and tried to get Barlows to compensate us for their error but they would not do it. They are the only reason I would consider buying my appliances in the future from somewhere else instead of Home Depot unless Home Depot changes who they use for deliveries.

Food and Service were mediocre. We walked in at 3:00pm and were seated all the way in the back. The server must not have been informed that we were seated in the back because she did not show up until 10 minutes AFTER we were seated. The food was close to grossness with no flavor. Even the kids did not like their meal.

We had the margherita, the pistachio one and the arugula one. All very good. The pistachio and margherita are my favs. Will go here again. Only waited 15 minutes for a table on a Saturday for lunch around noon time.   Their bathrooms need some cleaning up.

You can find all sorts of fresh Halal meat and chicken here. The butcher, Hassan is friendly. They prepare everything like you want it. There is also a restaurant up front which only serves halal food called Al-Hana. The beef shawarma is awesome and so is the rotisserie chicken served with a Garlic sauch which is to die for. And of course it is all halal which is great! We used to live in Tucson and we still would come to Baiz market to purchase all our halal meat because they keep it clean unlike the other so called halal meat stores we have visited. The store is pretty big and they carry indian masalas, European cheeses, a variety of spices and canned goods and also some cutlery and pots and stuff to sell. You will also be able to find a hookah here. They have the best and most fresh pita breads too. Plus they have a large variety of fresh vegetables. The prices are very reasonable except for the halal meat and chicken.  Awesome place. Neighborhood is a little shady and you need to know your way around downtown. There are no other shops around this place so when we go here, we just go to this shop and back home.

We no longer buy our meat from this place because the quality of service and product has been going down and down over the last year or so. After having to throw away the ground beef for the second time, we finally made the switch to I-Mart for all our meat related purchases. When we would ask for extra lean ground beef, we would have to pay an astronomically high price AND it was still not extra lean. It was full of fat and seems like they were mixing in lamb with it too because it stank like hell.   I was getting tired of being badly treated by the butchers who conveniently went deaf when we would ask for something (not in Arabic) but would be completely on their toes helping whoever spoke in Arabic exclusively with them. One time when I asked for a woman to repeat herself behind the counter, she literally stared and me for a few seconds and moved over and started helping someone else. I guess we are not good enough for them to help over there.   We still like the Al-Hana restaurant and they do offer some good spices that we will go in and purchase but we will no longer be using their meat counter.

I have recently discovered their Labne cheese made fresh. It is sold near the fresh breads and sweets right next to the meat butcher.  It is delicious. The taste and texture is just like cream cheese and I got a whole quart for only $5. We'll be in cheese for months! I have also purchased meat again from here and it was really good quality. They have streamlined their process where everyone gets a ticket at the butcher counter and is helped when their number is called. Baiz Market really needs to invest in one of those smaller shopping carts so everyone is not banging into each other since the aisles are so narrow for the shoppers.

Love the store. Its fun going through different departments and getting ideas for your own home. We have tons of stuff from IKEA and it does NOT feel like a college dorm room. I don't know what the last person is talking about. They actually have pretty cool things. I don't think I have ever found a label on IKEA stuff that says it is Made in China. It is always another exotic country. Its cool.  Anyways, the best part about IKEA might be a little surprising to you but we love it and it is the Fat Free Yogurt they serve for $1 and also their Pepsi Cola. You can only buy these to go from the deli counter in front of the check out lines. The Pepsi tastes sooooo different than the regular stuff you get at fast food joints. I think the formula is swedish. It is yummy. Got more zing to it. Ikea also has a restaurant upstairs that serves some pretty amazing penne pasta with marinara sauce. It is filling and cheap.

Went there for hubs MBA graduation today. NOT GOOD FOR KIDS! DO NOT BRING YOUR KIDS HERE!!!! I did. They wouldn't let us use the stroller around the walk around, or watever you call that thing. We could carry the baby but we had to keep moving. As soon as we stopped, the vultures from the security company would jump on us and ask us to keep moving or go outside. My father in law was visiting from the east coast and had to take the lil'un outside. He ended up missing seeing his son walk. Oh well, I guess there are DVDs for such things. They had a lot of area sectioned off for the people in wheel chairs and for the disabled which is fine but hey, how about sectioning off some special area for moms with strollers or dads with babies and bottles and diaper bags and gold fish, and crackers, and cameras too! Gosh!!!  The stairs are kinda steep without having anything to hold on too...so wear shoes with good traction.   The seats are too close to each other. Kinda felt crammed. Or is it cramped. Dunno.  Positives; Wells Fargo Arena is easy to find. It looked clean. The parking garage was okay. Looks new.  It is quite a hike especially for elderly folks or in crazy ass Phx temperatures.  The flowers they were selling outside were yucky and really low quality. Bring your own flowers if you wanna present it to someone at the ceremony etc.

I am glad that they carry halal meats and serve halal food. Other then that, the food did not have much flavor. The service was slow not because of the lone waiter working the tables but the slowest kitchen staff that I have ever seen. When leaving we ordered some Baklava to go and it is the worst Baklava that I have ever eaten. ewww.... Do they even know how to make Baklava? I think not and on top of that they charge exorbitant prices for it. What a rip off. The food is very very bland. Good for people who don't like spicy foods.   We ordered the Pita Boat and they were both okay. Overall we ended up paying around $30 for 2 adults and 1 kid plus 3 pieces of the awful baklava. I am going to give this place one more try. If the results are the same, will not be visiting it again.

Of course, they are no La Madeliene, but if you are looking for some good croissants, this is the place to be. I love, love, love their croissants. But which bakery's croissants do I not love? hmm... But I do love theirs. I have had the almond croissant, the almond and chocolate croissant and finally today when we went there, I had the chocolate croissant. It was just freaking amazing. That's all I can say. (They run out of the chocolate almond croissants pretty quickly so go early if you want some)  I have also had lunch here before, some Mediterranean sandwich stuff. The portion is very small compared to the price. Their macaroons look crazy and funky. Have not tried them yet but plan on doing so next time. I almost gave them 4 stars because their hours they are open are very weird. But its okay, I will compromise Essence Bakery.   They only use butter imported from Normandy in their Croissants. Wow.

We went there on a hot Tuesday afternoon. It turns out that they are in the same parking lot as Lee Lee Oriental Supermarket and since I go to Lee Lees a lot, we decided to swing by Gelato 64 as well. The cashier came out from the kitchen/prep area to help us. They have a bunch of sorbets, and of course gelato. I tried the Chocolate Turtle and the Ferrero Rocher flavors. I was not disappointed.   But, there was something missing. The gelato wasn't out of this world or anything and they sure could do more in regards to making their desserts more appealing visually. It looked like that effort was put in making the actual product but not in the presentation.   I am not going to be craaaving to go back or anything. In my opinion, none of the gelato shops in Phoenix compare to Frost in Tucson. Sigh... Now, I would actually drive down to Tucson from Phx for some Frost gelato. Yumm..

This place has the right balance of ambience and great food. I like going here. Their food is so comforting.   I have tried the Panang Curry with shrimp which was great. Also the fish cakes are very flavorful. I did not like the Pad See Ew because of the overly eggy flavor but they quickly replaced it with my favorite Goob Ob Won Sen when I returned the plate.   Great for lunch or dinner. Right next to the dollar theater. Must visit.

I think this place could do a lot better considering it is one of THE premiere farmers markets in the city. Have only been here once so will update as we go more often.  I did buy some handmade soap. It turned out to be wonderful. It smells divine and is all natural. I prefer it over Lush soaps.  The food trucks were nothing what I had read about in the online reviews. We only saw like three or four and the one we wanted to eat at, her catfish ran out just as we approached the window.

Been hanging out here more and more. They sell some cool stuff now. I saw Canoli's from Jerusalem Bakery, hydroponic tomatoes which were actually black and they are delicious! I found a strange looking broccoli from Maya's farm who sells there and the kids just ate it all up. They loved it. I think the strange but delicious items are the best. I also got the french breakfast radishes. They are delish! The samosas from the chalet were pretty good and also the catfish poboys from one of the trucks are great. A little on the spicy side.  Al-Hamka farms sells some very reasonably priced salad greens and they look delicious although I have not tried them yet. I did get some Chinese Radishes from her a few weeks ago and they were crunchy and gorgeous.

Good mall. The crowd around three years back used to be all rich and yuppie teenagers with barely any clothes on but now it seems there are more families walking around.   I love visiting the food court. Rubios, paradise bakery and villa pizza are not bad at all. It is not uncommon to see a Lamborghini or some other exotic car parked outside the Kona restaurant just outside the food court.   Try to park around Nordstrom or Sears. It is easy to find parking on that side. The worst parking is near Barnes and Noble and Cheesecake Factory. The barnes and noble at this mall is acceptable with a childrens play area right outside for the little munchkins. Speaking of munchkins, there is a baby reading time offered at Barnes and Noble every Friday morning at 10:30am.   The mall is clean most of the time and they keep their restrooms clean too. Families can use the family restroom to take care of multiple kids at once or breastfeed babies etc.   The mall layout is kinda confusing. I still get lost in this thing and have to retrace my steps all the time. Once you go there, you will know what I  mean. The banana republic folks at this mall are not much help compared to the one at Scottsdale mall.

Good place. Spicy tuna, 8 piece roll was only $6.25. Generous portions. Serve Miso Soup and Edamame when you order. No nonsense place. Courteous staff and fast service. We went on a Monday night around 7pm. There were a lot of japanese individuals having dinner there so that tells you that this place must be good.

It just keeps getting better and better! I recently found out, thanx to yelp that Sushi Ken is the same as what used to be Sushi Ten in Tucson. OMG!!!!! Myself and my husband used to drool over the thought of Sushi Ten in Tucson and to my surprise now the same people have moved to Ahwatukee just for me so I can drool over their Sushi and eat it too without having to go drive to Tucson. Yikes! Love it Love it. The chunky scallop roll is the best. Try it. This time around I went to pick up around 8 on a Friday night. Had to wait 20 minutes extra because they were packed with people still waiting to be seated.

So after a 2 year hiatus..., we finally went in here again and you know what...we like it again. We have decided that we are going to avoid the eel because that seems to be the problematic item on their menu for us but otherwise everything was awesome including the servers who speak english clearly so we can understand them.

Umm, okay, I had to give you guys one more star Trader Joes! Why you ask?   Well, I came to your abode a few days ago looking specifically for castille soap. Yeah, I am driving hubs crazy with my homemade concoctions. I asked someone in the bread department where it was and that he walked me back way out of his way to show me. Really friendly staff. I am still docking one star because you do not carry essential oils other than tea tree oil.   Got some organic avacadoes for cheap also and they were really good quality, unlike the ones I normally get at Fry's.

I will never shop at this Banana Republic again. Went there with my lil'un in tow and the customer service reps did not stop following me around the whole time I was there. I was looking through the sales rack and one of the customer service people would not stop talking to me and wanting to show me more of the expensive stuff even after I told her I was looking for some good sale items. After a bit, I chose to ignore her (i think she was the person in charge there) and she just stood there not 3 feet away from me just staring as if I was going to walk away with all her merchandise or something! This is the second time that I have felt like I was being stalked as a thief at THIS Banana Republic. Never again and oh yeah, corporate will be hearing about this one.

I like cool kids for two reasons. When you go there, there is a nice play area for your kids in the back to keep them occupied. The second reason is that once on the chopping block...car, or aeroplane, the kids can watch whatever video they prefer while having their hair cut. I am guessing the number once choice in little kids is "Elmo!"  The reason I do not like them is that if you do not have an appointment you have to wait for more than 40-45 minutes as there is always a steady stream of customers walking in and typically only one hair stylist. One good thing to know is that if your kid has a code brown and you do not have a diaper...they do not provide diapers for a diaper change and you have to re-schedule the appointment as that is a strict no no when they are cutting the kids hair.   My tips: If you have a tiny munchkin, make sure he or she is well fed and have plenty of interesting snacks on hand before you put him/her on the chopping block. Otherwise...be prepared for a meltdown. I would also take the munchkin right after a long nap so they are not cranky.  The price is okay for a nice haircut. They have raised it up to $17.95 plus tip.

This is the best tasting pizza ever! We love to order the one topping extra large with just mushrooms. Yummmm. They slice their mushrooms extra thin so when they are cooked under the hot oven, they don't get all mushy but instead become full of flavor. My mouth is watering just thinking about them...  We have always requested delivery and it has always come on time and in the best possible condition. Very fast and friendly service.

We go here at least once a month. It seems economical but I think I spend more money here than anywhere else. But I do use most things. Umm..Most.  This particular Costco is fairly new. Maybe opened around 2005. We just bought a memory foam mattress from here and they also had a coupon in their "coupons" flyer for a $100 off. It was a great buy considering we would have paid twice what we spent here at a roomstore or ashley furniture for a simple mattress much less a memory foam mattress. The mattress fit fine in our 2007 camry in the backseat. It comes on rollers.  We love the little samples they give out but have rarely purchased what they are advertising, except for the Mango Nectar. Yumm...  We really like the Kirkland papertowels. I like them better than Bounty. Also their Hummus is awesome. They also have fresh Medjool dates for 6 months out of the year. More towards the warmer months of the year. They come from California and are much cheaper than most other places. I prefer not to get their fruit and veggies there because it is too much and it mostly goes bad before i get to it.  Word is that they import their lamb directly from Australia and it is halal.  Although I have never returned anything yet at Costco, I do like their return policy. They do take "anything" back. I have seen people returning watermelons e.t.c before.   I prefer Costco over Sam's Club because of its organization and cleanliness. The employees are friendly and helpful once you can find one. From what I understand Costco pays their employess $20 an hour!!! They all look very professional.

Extremely cheap prices. Kung Pao shrimp was pretty good and only $5 with white rice or with combo only $8. Combo comes with, fried rice, 2 crab puffs, 1 veggie egg roll. Service was great and fast! Great place to go for a cheap lunch. They deliver also with no delivery charge.

This is the Rolls Royce of all Fry's Marketplace stores. I've been shopping Fry's or its sister/brother stores for more than a decade. This is the best store that I have been to in the chain. The parking was easy. I was promptly greeted by a door greeter and since this was my first time in this particular store, he was also very helpful in pointing out where I should head to for things I needed. The aisles are spacious and roomy. This store might actually be really good for those of you who are claustrophobic.   The cashier who checked me out was super friendly. Very cheerful.

This place is not good and their billing department is the worst! I am about to write to the Better Business Bureau!

This is a new store and has several sales going on at any given time. They carry a great collection for little girls but for boys it is a challenge to find things that are cute but boyish and still pocket friendly.   The customer service at this store is average but they try hard to be friendly. One bad thing, they do not give you a small shopping cart to push around so if you have a toddler, either you are carrying them the whole time, or you can bring in your stroller and shop or you can let the kid go wild in the store. This store is near the Chandler mall but not IN the mall. It is its own separate thing.  I bought five outfits the other day for $25! Not bad.

Tried to get my kiddo's passport photos taken here and they tried to pass up an extremely blurry pic as perfectly a-ok. The manager was useless. They have updated the inside of this walgreens.

I am afraid to write this review in the fear that the whole world is going to start flocking to this place and they won't have time to see us anymore... sigh. Things I do for you yelpers!  This office is the best ever pediatricians office we have ever been too. They always treat you professionally and with courtesy. They also do same day appointments for the really really sick. There are two seperate entrances  to this pediatricians office and also seperate seating areas. One is for sick child, and the other is for well child. This gives me peace of mind when I take my lil'un there. They also have different theme rooms. One room is cowboy theme, the other one is all about panda's. There is a teddy bear room too. My kid just loves it there.  The doctors are very professional. We mostly see Dr. Nania who is one of the most gentlest but sharp pediatricians out there. Always gives good advice and is not pushy. She explains things in a very easy to understand way and always waits for your input.   Btw, they also got the swine flu vaccine like two weeks ago when the rest of the doctors/flu offices are still waiting for it.  You will love it here.

So what I feared has happened. The wait time here is pretty bad at times but has gotten better in the last few months. I think they are working on it.  They used to keep me on hold on the phone for up to 20 minutes until I spoke with the office manager a while back.   Although there are four doctors in this office, only two or three are available at any given time. There is one usually off each day during the week. Even the day after a holiday weekend, they do not have a fully staffed office.

Update: They do  not have the USPS Flat Rate Box Service which sucked. Ended up having to pay twice what I would have paid with the Flat Rate. Oh well. At least I did not have to wait in a long line at the post office with a squirmy baby. :-)   Very friendly and courteous service. They have Fed Ex, UPS and also United States Postal Service there. They gave me several different shipping options. Much better service than at the post office. I will go here again!!!

We like the new location which is facing 40th street and Safeway. They keep it clean. People are attentive and I like the fact that I don't have to wait in line forever like at the post office.   They also save your old addresses that you have shipped to before so you don't have to give that info all over again if you send to the same place a lot.

Went in there last weekend to purchase some watercolors! This place looks small from outside but is in fact pretty large inside. Did not have time to peruse throughout the store but will go there when I have more time again.  The watercolor selection is limited as in they do not carry a ton of different brands. The lady at the cashier stand was not very helpful nor was she friendly. It was a sunday and it looked like she really did not like being there.   They do carry different grains of watercolor paper which is great and I was helped by a nice gentleman with picking out some for me. He even pointed out the one that was a really good grain and was on sale that week.   The store is slightly unorganized as in the watercolors were in one section, the brushes were in a totally seperate section and then I couldn't find the watercolor paper anywhere until the associate helped me. They also have some books on different art subjects but again they too are unorganized. Some are near the seating area...right near the cashiers and then the rest are supposed to be on the far wall. Didn't have a chance to walk all the way over there. Did I mention, this place is huge. They also hold weekly watercolor and sketching classes at this place.   Anyway, I will be making my future watercolor supplies purchases from Jerry's Artarama. It was easy to find and a basic no nonsense place.

Bought stuff at JC Penney. Got a haircut at the JC Penney Salon. Inquired in the photo department.   Overall experience. Damn Good!   I always forget JC Penney when it comes to shopping because it is located in a weird corner. But not anymore. People were super friendly and helpful and I felt like they really liked working there. Way better than Kohl's.

So I was driving on Baseline one saturday afternoon when I saw the sign that made me go What!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and my car automatically started making a U Turn to go right back to the sign. The sign said: Mango Trees.  What!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! In Phoenix? No way!  Well, sure enough, as I walked in, I felt like I was in heaven. There were a ton of mango trees in this little nursery but also banana trees, GUAVA trees!! (What!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) lemon trees, orange trees and any tropical fruit tree you can imagine.   The owner was there and he was so helpful. He showed me so many different types of mango trees and even took out a book of different mangoes so we could go over the ones that I wanted. I ended up buying just one tree as I only have a little patio. The owner explained to me how I can take care of my mango tree in a big pot since I do not have any backyard space. He told me what soil to purchase, what direction I should plant this tree and how often to water it, how often to give it some compost...i mean, this guy really knows his stuff. I even went to his website and wow, it is just a very detailed and informative source.  We discussed different types of mangoes and then I mentioned that I really liked Indian Mangoes...and guess what!!!!!!!!!! He had a Alphonso Mango tree! No way!!!! I was beyond excited at this point and wanted to just hug the owner but had to pull back a little. Giggles... Then I mentioned how I also liked the yellow mangoes they carry at Lee Lee Oriental Market in the summer and he showed me a picture of it and he had several of those mango trees. The prices ranged from $20 and up. The more mature plants were $55 and up. I asked what hours the nursery is open and the owner replied that he lives there, so it is open 24/7.  This is a must see nursery for anyone who has even a little interest in plants. Just go here. You will not be disappointed.

Stopped by the Apache Junction location recently to purchase a Keitt Mango Tree, 2 Curry Leaf Trees and a Tamarind Tree. Love the selection he has. He even had a bunch of sugarcane plants and other types of Mango trees.  The owner is Very helpful in answering any questions. The store is only open most days from 8:00am to 12:00pm but if you let him know, he can stay around for a late pick up etc.

Other than waking up early on a Saturday morning to get there by 7am...I love this Food Co-op. Everyone was very helpful and efficient. I did  the bountiful baskets on 32nd St and Chandler Blvd at Vista Canyon Park. Because of Bountiful Baskets, we have eaten more veggies and fruits this week than ever before. Even my hubby is excited about eating fruit for dessert which is completely unusual. The amount of food was awesome. I even got two pomegranets in my basket. Never would have bought them otherwise. The cantalope and the apples are super delicious and are sweet as honey. Even my toddler asked for more.   I did have to throw away the lettuce I got because it was already wilting when I picked it up and then I never got a chance to make something quickly.   The site that I picked up my stuff from is there every other weekend. I don't mind that because the amount of things we got will last us quite a long time. I just don't know what to do with all the sweet potatoes that I got in my basket this week because we don't eat much of that stuff.

I am loving the 9 grain bread they have and also the Ciabatta bread. Have made tons of brushchetta with the Ciabatta and the tomatoes I got last week. Some of the volunteers attitudes could be better at the places I pick up my basket at but what can you do. Its a Co-Op so just have to live with it.

I have stopped using them. All their food comes from Mexico or beyond. It is not local. Yes, you do get a lot of food but you seriously can't use it all and then it ends up rotting in the fridge because it is already old food.   Also, the volunteers are super rude and act like jerks.

This Whole Foods is large, roomy and has all the kewl stuff that I cannot afford. Maybe an organic apple...but that's about it!   Ha.ha... I typically go to Whole Foods Market for Homeopathic medicine and to pick up some essential oils. This place is a little out of my way so I end up here every two months. Last time I swung by, there was a very helpful gentleman in the apothecary department. He took the time to take me around the store as I blurted out different things I needed/wanted. You know, I like the kind of service where they look you in the eye when you speak to them and don't get a smirk started when you ask for the grapefruit seed extract etc.  Anyways, when you enter this Whole Foods, be prepared for an amazing smell of all the fresh fruit they have laid out for you to peruse. Nothing like the sterile smell when you walk into a Fry's or other large grocery stores. The apples smell good even when you get them home and I have been trying to get hubs to eat an apple at his lunch for five years and even though he doesn't know where the apples come from, he always, always eats the ones from Whole Foods. They just give off this true apple-e smell. I think I am going back to WF today for the apples.   Like their return policy. The receipt says that you can bring back most things with a receipt.

Brilliant Sky is an excellent childrens toy store. But, its not only a toy store. On mondays and tuesdays around 10:00am or so, the also have story time, arts and crafts, face painting and puppet making.   This is an excellent place to bring your kids to hang out and let them run around. The rule is that you can play with any toys that are on the floor. All the kids have a blast! The people at this store are super nice.   When you first enter the store, it may seem a little overwhelming because of so many toys, everywhere! But, take a deep breath and slowly make your way around. You will thoroughly enjoy being there. The kids also like the fish tank they have in the back.   I love supporting local businesses and this one fits the bill.

Recently there have been major changes to this store which has made it just like the big box stores and there is no uniqueness left here for me to feel comfortable to leave it at five stars.  Last two times that I have gone to this store, I literally had two or three people ask me over and over if I needed help. I explained that I was there to just spend time for their Tuesday baby-time and one of the ladies was like, oh, the book reading already got done with and stared at me. They kept pushing new toys, etc on me and I really felt uncomfortable. I even mentioned it to another friend who concurred. I did end up buying things that I was already going to buy but they wouldn't stop there. The cashier lady kept showing me new things even though I was ready to check out. They also now carry a really limited amount of toys. They have stopped carrying a lot of toys that I went back to purchase to gift to other families. The manager did not even offer to special order them or anything. I can of course get the same toys at amazon.com for a lot cheaper and free shipping but I thought I would support the local business. Whatever.   A few days later, I found out from a different friend that apparently they have had the baby-time abused by some parents(stolen items) and they are not doing it anymore, or only doing the book reading. They DO NOT allow your child to play with the toys anymore and if by chance your little one pulls a toy off the shelf, they ask you to put it back up. Ouch. I do that anyway but sometimes if you are chasing a toddler, its hard to keep up with all that. Other moms were complaining and felt offended when asked to do so.   Bottom line: I am no longer shopping here. I will go to Buy Buy Baby or Lakeshore Learning Center instead.

To correct the previous reviewer, the US Post Office is NOT government owned but is in fact an independent agency and run as a corporation. This particular Post Office has much better customer service than most other places I have been to.  True there are only a couple of people working at a time to help customers but I have NEVER seen a line out the door in the whole year that I have been going to this post office.   The postal employees here are patient. Yes, they have not been trained in the five points of being a friendly customer service rep but hey, I will take these post office employees over any other.

So ended up taking the parent child swimming classes this month and they worked out great. There is a lot of repetition of the same moves and the instructor made it clear when we started the class that the YMCA swim classes should not be taken over and over but instead you learn your moves and techniques and then practice it with your child. Make sure and have a non-disposable diaper on your kid if you want to go to the swimming pool. They do not like the huggies swimmers diapers in the pool.

Favorite: Badminton on Sundays from 1:00pm to 5:00pm.   This place has really grown on me. It has taken a little getting used to but it is amazing how much they do for the community. Good pool. Really good group workouts. The equipment is all working and in good condition. During the summer they have an amazing amount of activities for all kids, not just for the summer camp kids. The summer camps look great.

I loved the Salmon Kebab with Sabji Pulo. Yumm...  The Pulo or rice was the best I have ever eaten. And we eat rice almost daily.   We also had the chicken and the lamb kebabs. I just had a little taste of them but they were not out of this world or anything.   The owners confirmed that they have recently gone Kosher. No halal meats here although the menu still says it is halal.  Place is kinda small. Good to call in a reservation on weekends.

Awesome Beef Shawarma. The chicken taook plate is just yummy and so filling. Cheap. Halal. They also have chicken shawarma, falafel shawarma and other plates. They do rotisserie chicken on site as well. Meat pies. Yumm... They have a wood burning oven where they make all their stuff. It is pretty cool to watch. Recently updated their eating area. Dont forget to get the Mango Lassi located behind you when you are ordering. While you are here, you can shop for fresh meat such as goat chops, beef, chicken, lamb e.t.c or groceries and spices. They have tons of choices in Indian spices as well as Mediterranean spices. They have a good selection of European Cheese and European Fine Goods. They also have fresh pita bread. We bring the pita bread home and throw them in the oven at 250 degrees for a few minutes and voila, you have pita chips to eat with your hummus.

Have you ever tried the chicken rotisserie here? They go fast so you have to be lucky to get one unless you call ahead. Its not so much about the rotisserie chicken as it is about the amazing and creamy and smooth and exceptionally well balanced Garlic Sauce/spread they give you that goes along with the chicken.   Have I told you how amazing this spread is. If only I knew the recipe...I would eat it by the tub...okay maybe by the spoonfuls. Anyway...try the chicken rotisserie or the chicken taook. Heck if you don't want to eat either of those things...just ask for some garlic sauce on the side with whatever you are eating. You will not be disappointed.

The service at the counter for the restaurant is really poor. The cashiers will speak to you very rudely even if you are a paying customer. We have ignored poor service many times. The tables are hardly ever clean. They do not train their employees properly in customer service.

We've been here a few more times and they do pay attention to the spice levels when we discuss with the order taker. If you make reservations, they set the table up and take you in right away. Much better to eat this way.   Although we have ordered mild spiciness levels the last few times, I think I am going to give them a shot again next time and order the medium spiciness level. I think their food probably tastes best with spiciness at the medium level.   I like their curries and vegetables better than the tandoori meats.

Wow! I had Dianne over for my lil'un's birthday party this past weekend and she was amazing! She came 10 minutes early in her butterfly wings, set up everything very quickly and was ready to go! She has such a gentle presence about her that all the kids just kinda gathered around her and did not hesitate a bit about getting their faces painted. All the adults took part too and it was really so painful to have to wash everything away at the end of the day because the face painting looked awesome and perfect!  I saw her do beautiful butterflies, birds, flowers, disney characters, trucks, dragons, cats, tigers and a bunch of other things. She said that if we could show her a picture of anything we wanted on our face, she could do it. So one kid had her do transformers on his hands and they looked very accurate. She did that by looking at a picture on someones phone and it only takes like 2 minutes for her to finish a face.   We ended up keeping her for an extra half an hour and she was only going to charge me for one hour and I was like, you came 10 minutes early, stayed late, you deserve your full charge. She is the sweetest thing ever. I would not hesitate in recommending her to my friends. She made my kids birthday party so very extra special.

M830  Only stared at our number for about 20 minutes if even that. We made sure and went early. Early meaning 9:00am. We were very courteously helped by two ladies immediately upon entering the MVD, or is it DMV. Anyways, they answered all our questions regarding our car registration.  Now, the public. Hmmm... The public or customers should I say in this area are not that economically well to do. So..hmm...there was a couple next to us being helped and the guy was clearly drunk or on something because it sounded like he was told something that he did not want to hear and he just got up and pushed his chair away and stormed out mumbling something. My husband at one point asked me if I wanted to go sit in the car when the little'un was being rowdy and I turned to him and said, no way, I did not feel safe out in the parking lot by my self. Looking around the room it self, there were just a ton of sad faces staring blankly in to space waiting for their number to be called.   So after waiting for about 20 minutes we were helped by Mary at Station 8. She was a joy. When we asked her some questions, she patiently answered and also made nice comments about our family. When she forgot to hand us the registration form that had printed on her printer and we had to point out, she promptly apologized. Mary had a smile on her face from the beginning to the end while helping us.  When leaving my husband made the comment that this was the best MVD experience he had ever had and I completely agree. I never would have thought I would give a MVD place 5 stars but here they are. Thanx Mary!

The fountains were not timed with the music or so it seemed to me. Very short show. Too big of a crowd at 8:00pm. Person driving the car wasn't able to find parking at all and missed the entire show. Good for kids.

Awful Yogurt. How the hell can you screw up the flavor "Chocolate?" Well, Mojo Yogurt can. And they have. I wanted to puke after I took a few spoonfuls in the hope that the next spoonful would be better somehow because it looked like chocolate and it said it was chocolate so it MUST be chocolate...but no. It was just grossness. Oh and the $8 price for it was the last straw.

This place is awesome. I love all the doctors here. Same day appointments are hard to get if you are a brand new patient but once you are in, they will take you or try at least to get you in the same day. The office is super clean, roomy and very professionally done.   All the doctors and nurses use wireless laptops when they come in to examine you so by the time you walk out the door towards the main receptionist area, your prescription is already printed. The doctors really listen to you and spend time with you to gather information instead of hurrying away. I was really impressed by the Saturday Morning hours too for the doctors! Who does THAT anymore? You can also get your blood testing done right there on site. They have a lab right there.   Internists typically have some kind of specialty that they have spent extra time training for so I asked the receptionists what all the doctors specialized in and she told me it is diabetes. I use them as my Primary Care Physicians though.

And then it all changed...  I think this is my very first review that has been demoted to 1 star after being on the coveted 5 star for a long time.   So, where do I start. After feeling dog sick for a few days, I finally decided to "walk-in" to this place because that's what they do now supposedly. They take walk in patients who are seen by the NP. I signed in at 8:20 and was not called in the back until 10:00am. Then I waited another 35 minutes for the NP to come in and see me. By the time everything was over, it was 11:00am before I walked out of this place.   I asked to talk to Brenda, the office manager and was brushed off twice. Supposedly she is going to call me but would not see me when i was there for two and a half hours! I guess she didn't have the balls to face me at that point. What could she have said really?   The front desk lady did a screw up and let another walk in patient go before me even though he came 10 minutes after I had already signed in. When I pointed that out, she said he came before me and I had to show her the sign in chart. Instead of apologizing, she just kept doing what she was busy doing without acknowledging her mistake.   When the NP did come see me, she missed a couple of key things in my chart that she totally should have asked me about. I was quite appalled. I had to point out a deathly allergy that I have even though it should already be in my chart.   My final analysis: In my opinion, don't go here if your health and time are valuable to you.

We bought compost to sprinkle over the new winter grass seed we are planting for the cooler months.  The compost is fine, was cheap for the amount we got, and the people were very helpful. This was our first time to Singh Farms. He plans on opening the farmers market again this year around late October. He said his "babies" were not ready yet to open up the farmers market. :-)  Love.

Good Store. They keep it fully stocked most of the times. Cashiers are super nice once you get to know them. Pharmacists are helpful but a little over stressed and busy. This store is open 24 hours. I also like the sales that CVS does each week. When the sales are hot, they typically run out of that particular item but re-stock it by Friday afternoon for that weeks sale. I have had to return a couple of items before and they took them back without any problems. Once I did not have a receipt and the manager was a little abrupt but was able to do the return.

Another review demotion in progress...  This pharmacy is always busy but I can understand that. What I don't understand is the attitude from the pharmacy technicians when I go drop off or pick up the prescription. Also, I had to wait on the phone for 20 minutes to speak to a pharmacist for a question that I had. When these many things add up...time to change the gawddang pharmacy. I am going to Target Pharmacy next. They always seem to be properly staffed, alert to the customers needs and very helpful.

Since they have a drive-thru and I was in a hurry, we went to this pharmacy again. The pharmacist screwed up on a prescription that could have done some serious damage and didn't even offer to counsel while I was at the window. I had to ask and then he just asked me to tell him what it said on the bag so he could tell me what to avoid etc. We did use 3 doses on our child before realizing the mistake. I will not be using this pharmacy again.

I like this CVS Pharmacy because they always have what I am looking for whether its been a sale item etc. I get the feeling this is not a high traffic CVS but I could be wrong. They have a Minute Clinic inside tihs CVS. Will be writing their review later onz.   This particular CVS has a beauty corner where they have a special beauty person helping people with their beauty needs. The cashiers can be a little pain in the arse to deal with but other then that, it is fine.

Update for the Minute Clinic:   I don't really like going here but when you are dog sick on a weekend, this is a place to be. At least you can get some antibiotics etc. The nurse practitioners keep rotating so its never the same one and some of them act stupid or have an attitude. They hardly ever diagnose the exact problem but sometimes the meds they give you cover most things so you end up A-OK for the most part. I went twice in a row and they missed my allergies and I suffered for weeks until my PCP diagonosed it in 2 minutes. Always say YES to the question on the little sign in kiosk for the survey they e-mail you. This way you can at least provide honest feedback. There is a looong wait once you get there. I waited 1.5 hours once. They do not see patients less than 18 months old, just so ya know.  Minute Clinic does accept most insurance.

Love to drink tea. Drink it every single day. When I saw this store at the Scottsdale Fashion Square I was mildly excited. I walked in because the store looked cool. Finally I thought people are giving enough respect to TEA that they opened a whole store dedicated to this awesome beverage! Yeay!  I thought I would try a couple of samples that were situated towards the outer perimeter of the store and that would be it  thinking I probably wouldn't like anything because I tend to get picky about taste, smell etc   I was promptly greeted by a very friendly associate and he offered me the samples that I had my eye on. He noticed I wasn't impressed so he lured me in with the promise of yet another cool tea sample. While I was sampling my teas, he went through the background of each tea.  After asking me about what teas I typically liked, he took me to the very back towards the cashier area(yeah, I know, suckerrrr) and from behind the counter he brought out several large tea containers with really cool names. He prompted me to smell some popular flavors by fanning the lid towards me.   Needless to say, I ended up liking a black tea, its called Mrs. Earl Grey, who knew there was a Mrs. too. Wow! He also up sold me on a cool teavana container which keeps your teas fresh for up to a year!   I have tried the tea. I love the smell. The tea needs to be steeped a long time to get the full effect I think and I wish he would have mentioned that because I am not a patient person when it comes to teas.   Either way, will I go back? Yes. Gotta keep trying my samples. I know I will find the ONE, one day.

It sounds to me that their lunch  buffet is the problem but other wise Cafe Krishna is a great place for vegetarian fare from India. Their food is mainly south indian such as dosas, chutneys etc.   We have eaten dessert here at night time and our impression was great, not only of the gulab jamuns, rass-malai and the mango kulfi that we ate but also of the service and their overall setup. This is a clean south indian eatery unlike the Udupi place in Tempe. Go here, you will like.

We have eaten here a few more times and each time we have been, we have liked this place more. We mostly go for dinner. The masala in the dosa is very bland and not enough. The Sambhar could be a tad more spicy. But, overall we like this place. He loved the Gobi Manchurian that they serve there and the naans were awesome. Better than any north indian restaurant naans that we have eaten and mind you this is a south indian restaurant. My vegetarian and vegan friends love this place.

Fail!  After having an okay dinner on a Sunday night, we ordered dessert here. There was an all new wait staff and they kept changing the music from Indian to Korean.   My husband ordered the dessert called Ras Malai. He started to eat it and then it kept tasting worse and worse to him. I tried it and I threw up in my napkin. It was awful!   When I called the waiter over to tell him that the Ras Malai had gone bad he said that "I thought that it looked a little iffy, but brought it out anyway." WTF!!!!! Even our kid had taken a bite when we first got it. Husband spent the night in the bathroom to say the least.   What a bloody awful experience here. I am really questioning the freshness of ALL foods here now. Yuck!

I don't like shopping at sports authority for a number of reasons. First of all, when you walk in, there is no one in sight who wants to help you. The store is too huge and has too much stuff so you most certainly will get overwhelmed even if you spend a short time there. If you are looking for a swimsuit, you are better off going to Kohl's or Target. These guys do not have a good collection at all. All the swimsuits look exactly the same. Even the ones on sale are not really that cheap.   This store is so large that you most certainly will need help with where things are located etc. They need a serious revamp of this store to make it more customer friendly.

Courteous and professional. Need I say more? I had to call him to remind him about the text I sent him but he was apologetic and scheduled me right away. Gave me suggestions on different things that I had questions about. Will be using him soon again for a bunch of stuff around the house.

Kiddo enjoys it here. I like that they try to build their "paying attention" qualities because they re-iterate it several times during their program. Just after a few weeks my lil'un is more confident with movement and is having tons of fun. David the owner is there all the times that we have been and the helpers are a lot of fun too.

We have done a birthday party here and kids had a lot of fun. I like it that they don't just run around like a crazy bunch of monkeys but instead are guided into some cool games and activities. They keep all the kids engaged and their pricing for birthday parties is not bad at all.

Dr. Dye did not follow up like she had claimed she would. The customer service here is lack luster. I called and left a message because had a question regarding medication and a sever reaction that my child had to the medication and Dr. Dye did not seem to care enough to pick up the phone to call back. She had her clerk call me back.   For the money you have to spend out of pocket, they could do much better.   Also, the remedies that were prescribed did not work.

One thing you will notice first off is that this store is ORGANIZED. I mean, wow! I have never seen so much baby stuff ever in one place. This store is great. It carries the regular Gerber, Playtex etc stuff but it also carries the off the beaten path stuff such as Plantoys and others.   We were promptly approached by a gentleman as soon as we entered the store and he quickly showed us where the things we needed were. Was very courteous. They also carry a better selection of baby strollers etc. Some are quite pricey. One thing I did notice, they are not cheap. Even milk bottles were a few dollars more than if you were to buy them at another store.   I am not sure if they do any coupons etc like Babies R Us but it would be worth it to check it out. We were in and out of that store pretty quickly which is greatly appreciated when you have a monster toddler in tow. lolz.  This store is located on the east side of 101 on Chandler Blvd. The parking situation is better than it is at Babies R Us at Ray Road.

This PIta Jungle is based inside the food court at Scottsdale Fashion Square.   Service could be a little better from the cashier(having eaten here twice now, it is hard to get a smile out of her) but the food is excellent. When I went there the first time I ordered the tuna pita wrap but I actually got it in a salad form with the pita on top. They are not very clear about that in their description. Sure was a Humm-dinger.   The tuna is great, lemony and just has the right amount of seasoning. Some people might find it slightly salty but that's how I like it. They also serve little cups filled with Sriracha sauce which is not greek or mediterranean at all but it absolutely added a little pizzaz to my salad as I was getting tired of it by the end. There is only so much grass one can chomp on before you start looking for something else to eat...Did I say this is a big salad?  This place is new and doing a grand job. Go there.

Eid Ul Fitr prayers were beautiful. The mosque is brand new and had really good accomodations for the crowd to bring them from the off site parking situation in little vans to the mosque and back. They also had a play area set up for all the kids in the back after the prayers. Will go here again even though I live in Ahwatukee....

This was my first and last time at this particular labcorp branch. The people that work here are most likely high school dropouts and have attitudes like prison guards. No smile, no courtesy. They actually yelled at a young teenager for signing his name on a line that wasn't highlighted and spoke to him in a condescending manner while I was waiting. I would have walked out if I didn't need to get my blood work done quickly. Another lady did walk out after seeing how they were handling their patients. Horrible, horrible place. Do not go here, go someplace else.

Nice little store. Picked up a few swatches. They also carry books with color schemes for your particular subdivision if you are in their neighborhood. This helped us out a lot. The color advisor worked out a few examples for us so we could see what the paint would look like on our house. You can e-mail her a picture of your house and she can have it ready for you when you get there. Just call ahead.

This review is only for the Roof Inspection.   When my home inspector called for additional investigating by a roofing company for the house we were purchasing I started making a few calls based on my Realtor's recommendations.   After no luck with other roofing companies, I called R & H Roofing after I noticed they are rated higher on BBB than other roofing companies.   Richard Hermosillo is a partner and he was prompt to call me back and showed up when he said he would to do the roof inspection. He also called to let us know he was on his way to the property in case we wanted to meet him there. He gave us a written quote and he did all this for FREE. He said he wanted our business so the inspection is typically free. Highly recommend for a roof inspection.

This place is so dirty. We have been to both locations. Here we only went to pick out my child's eye glasses when the old ones broke because for some reason they have very limited hours at the other office and we could only go pick them out over here.  They don't offer many choices in kids eye glasses, even though this is a kids eye doctor place. Duh..!  When I called to get directions to this place, a young man answered the phone and he was no help whatsoever. He really needs some training in customer service.

Their receipts never print out at the gas pump when you pay there. It ALWAYS says to go see the cashier inside.

This was the best mexican food I have ever eaten. I prefer the tex mex taste and this served the bill. The food tasted so fresh. The Guacamole is a dream. Their chips were so different but amazing! Everyone at our table including kids loved what they got.   The service was immaculate.   Will go here again.

Yeah, its that good! This place has a complete relaxed atmosphere. There were several customers sitting outside with their dogs enjoying their favorite fro-yo. If I am craving frozen yogurt next time or any type of dessert for that matter, I will be stopping by this place.   I tried the Dulche Leche and Chocolate flavors and they were delicious!

No. 16 on the menu for any vegetarian is a blessing! Try it. Plus at $5 it is a freaking deal! I have also tried the salt and pepper prawns. They are awesome! They work fast and our food was out in no time. The mango juice with boba drink is really good. Can't wait to go back here again. They keep the place clean and running smoothly.

They have the best price on Almond Flour. Even cheaper than online.   It is like a big warehouse with options towards grains etc. You can buy whole grains such as wheat etc but they carry a large variety of gluten free things too. Plus they have gluten free baking classes every thursday at 10:00am.

This place has some really good halal food. The spelling of "deshi" is incorrect as it should be "desi" i think but who cares. It's not my restaurant right.  So the best thing to do is order your food beforehand. Give them a good 40 minutes before you go pick it up as they make things from scratch. The food has tasted slightly different both times that we ordered, exactly the same things but nevertheless it tasted wonderful. The naan was great the first time but not the next time. I tihnk it makes a difference as to who is preparing your food. The first time when all things were excellent, the lady owner was the one in the kitchen. The second time it was her husband in the kitchen. They offer the regular grill items with either the naan option or rice option or just plain. We had Sheekh Kebab and also Bihari Kebab. They also carry Tandoori Chicken Kebabs etc. They do not have a sign up on top of their store to indicate that there is a restaurant there but they are in the same shopping center as I-Mart and are owned by I-Mart as well. This restaurant is specifically located between the thai restaurant and the mexican restaurant.   Also, this is a pick up only type of place so you will not be able to sit down and have a meal.

They do carry some really cool stuff. A little plan toy was around $40. I think I can find things on amazon cheaper but it was really good to actually find new things that I had never seen before. Whoever does the purchasing for this place does a good job.

Yes, I am a fan. I went into Curves with some trepidation as in if I would like it. If I would feel the same anxiety as I do at most gyms or if I would have to wait and wait for machines to be available. All my worries were blown away as soon as I walked in to this Curves. I was warmly greeted by Sally and she explained her program to me in detail. It makes complete sense. I signed up for the month to month plan because I have never liked being forced to sign up for the yearly plans at gyms. There typically is a catch with those and I hate them.   At Curves, they didn't try to pressure me into buying more things, or different packages. I have worked out here a few times now and I love it. All the ladies are friendly and the time flies by so quickly. It is a 30 minute workout and its a no-brainer which is what I like the most. I just do the work out and when the computer tells me to move on to the next machine, I do. I like the location. It is in the same parking lot as Trader Joes. Parking is typically not a hassle and they keep the place clean. I am actually looking forward to working out for the first time in my life after joining Curves. :-)

I have been seen by Dr. Karen Ragaini over the last several months and she has always been kind, has a good bedside manner and is very gentle in her mannerisms. I like to go to her and feel comfortable with the way that I am treated.   Some of the staff is either new or are over stressed because they can be a little rushed over the phone or sometimes in person. That is the only reason for four stars and not five. But like I said, the actual OB-Gyn is awesome.

Will never be using Keller Williams again. Used a realtor from Sonoran Living to try and sell our house and we were "advised" to spend thousands of dollars to upgrade. The realtor kept quoting a book about how spending more will have a better chance of selling the house as fast as possible and at "Top Dollar." If you hear those two words, RUN. The lady we were put in contact with who does the upgrades through her team of contractors did not tell us that she charges close to 25% commission for herself on all the upgrades we did. At the end AFTER all the work was done, she just simply texted us her fee. If she would have told us her fees upfront, we would never have used her in the first place. We paid it, but what a shock! Even a full blown interior designer would not take such a large cut.  When we eventually did list the house, we were advised to keep lowering the listing price sometimes on a weekly basis. There was definite pressure by the Sonoran Living realtor. After several weeks of no offers and our circumstances changing, we ended up not selling the house.  Anyway, we will not be using any realtor from Keller Williams again.

We have been to Curry Corner before and the interior was awful. Since then, looks like they updated it big time. It is clean and spacious inside. Lots of seating. Good for groups.   The food was really good. We had Tandoori Chicken Tikka, Chicken Biryani, Keema Aloo and of course the Goat Haleem. Haleem had plenty of goat meat with bones. Just like how mom makes it. The food has a homemade taste to it. If you haven't been to this place in a while, it is worth checking out because of all the updates. They also have a bunch of vegetarian dishes.   The service was very good although the girl doing the serving there needs to have a more friendlier attitude. Apparently Guy Fieri visited this restaurant a while back and some people were asking the girl they wanted to have what he ordered and she flatly informed them that she had never watched the show, so she wouldn't know. Any other person would try to find out if she or he didn't know herself. This is the "service" industry after all.

We've been here a few more times. Once, there was a long ass hair in one of the dishes. We chose to forgive and went again and the rice was undercooked, the waiter never smiles but stares glaringly, gets the wrong things than what we really want but close enough to not be able to send the dish back. They take forever to bring the food out including appetizers and the naan even takes longer to bring out. The service is beyond awful but they conveniently try to make you add a generous tip when you go to pay at the counter.   Any special requests such as an extra slice of lemon or some shredded ginger with the goat haleem are completely ignored and they don't even offer kids cups for the drinks. To think they have been in business for almost 20 years, they should have already worked out all the above mentioned kinks. Obviously the owners do not care about their clientele.   We will not be going here anymore.

I have been a fan of Frost since they opened their second store in Tucson near Sabino Canyon. I don't think there is a better Gelato place ever! And I mean Ever!!! I was so desperate to find out when they were opening one in Phoenix that I actually emailed them. They promptly informed me that they DO have a Frost open now and its in Gilbert!!!!! Umm... Yeah, that's only a 25 minute drive for me from Ahwatukee but hey, who cares. At least I don't have to drive allll the way to Tucson to get my Gelato fix. Not that I mind...but anyway...so here we go...and have been 3 times in the last 4 weeks.   Do I even have to tell you how amazing this place is? The more times we go, the more people are standing in line to get a piece of this heaven! I love the fact that they go around and serve water as you are experiencing your gelato. Makes it go down much better I think. The girls and guys that work there are phenomenal, actually look you in the eye when greeting and talking to you and always have a smile on their face. Why wouldn't they, they are selling happiness. :)

The food was not that great. It tasted like someone had just warmed up the leftovers. Even the fried rice was below average.   The service is so slow and they talk to you like they are doing you a favor. We also observed the manager or owner going at it with a back scratcher while sitting at one of the tables and talking with the chef in the back as we were eating our dinner. Gross.   This restaurant is located in a shady part of town and I would not go here again. I also highly doubt if they are Halal since the pictures show that they serve Pork.

Ordered the Samosa Appetizer to go. Their prices are a little expensive considering that the Samosa's were tiny and flavorless. The chutney was too thick. I do want to try the goat there. Some other day maybe. The place itself is very well set up and it would be nice to take colleagues etc to lunch there.

The indoor sports area is over crowded and sometimes with rowdy individuals. Badminton has become a joke with several people never getting a turn and having to play on the fringes where other people and children are walking/running. An accident waiting to happen.  A lot of individuals do not bring their own shuttlecocks to play with and then take the ones that belong to other players. They are expensive!   Very crowded. Have stopped going here.

The food was ok. We went on a Sunday night. It was an all buffet night but some of the items were already gone. We got there at around 6:15pm. They had plenty of naan and rice but the key items were gone. I got to taste a little bit of the masala chicken and that was the best out of all the dishes.   The place is very smoky inside as they do not have any exhaust for the extra smoke it seems. The servers didn't inform us about the buffet so we just sat there waiting for someone to help us until we flagged a server down and asked. I guess they just assumed we knew whatever the hell we were doing.   The servers are super slow and the girl that works there needs some vitamins or something because she looks really tired. They were taking kids in and out of the kitchen, sometimes without shoes on which kinda made me wanna hurl.  Oh, about that.., yes, I didn't hurl but I did go to the bathroom for a looooong time at around 11:30 that night. You get the idea. I am giving them 2 stars and not one because none of the other people at our table got sick. Just me.

The portions are small even though in the pictures they look kinda big because the tortillas itself are teeny tiny. You will spend twice as much as you thought you would originally because it is not as filling. For the same money, I can have a FEAST at Cheesecake factory. Just sayin...  Also, it seems they use garbanzo bean flour as the batter for the fish and shrimp and it leaves a weird after taste in your mouth.  I do like the different sauce and pico de gallo options they have. The service also is very friendly.

Good. Pizza gets a little soggy if you don't eat it right up. He needs to get those mesh metal plates that sit on top of the plate so the juices of the pizza don't make it soggy.   Nice outdoor experience. Staff was very attentive. We went on a Saturday after the Phoenix Farmers Market was done. The owner came out and talked to us and asked us how the food was. Very nice person.   Will go here again. Great place for families.

We came here right after an event where the food was catered by the Golden Restaurant and Bakery. We were still craving for more food but the event ran out of their delicious food and desserts.   The food is great. The interior is small but there is seating outside. Love the parking courtyard. It is so cute. Easy to miss.   The people are helpful in picking out the best items. We went with friends who are full on vegetarian and they enjoyed their meal too.   Very relaxed atmosphere. Will go here again.
