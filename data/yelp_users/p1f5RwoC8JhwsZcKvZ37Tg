We saw Dr. Mcomber here for some GI troubles our infant son was having.  I went in feeling confused and unsure of what was going on, and left feeling confident.  Dr. Mcomber was great not only with my son, but with me, making sure I understood everything and helping to calm my fears.  A great doctor with great bedside manner, clean facility, friendly nurses.

I inherited my grandfather's solitaire diamond necklace after he passed, and I had wanted it to become part of my wedding set.  With something so near and dear to my heart and so sentimental, I knew I had to find someone I could trust to handle creating something new out of the old. The big box jewelry stores made me nervous (told me they had to "send it out") and almost every one tried to get me to purchase a new stone.  When I took the diamond to Eric, I explained its significance, and he handled it with care and recognized the beauty in it.  I felt completely comfortable.  I turned over the diamond to my now husband, and he had a great experience picking out a setting with Eric.  After the proposal, we returned to have custom bands designed and created.  Eric is so knowledgeable and so creative!  His excitement about what he does is refreshing...you can tell he loves his craft. We ended up with the most gorgeous and unique rings, complete with black diamonds.  I get compliments everywhere I go!  Upon picking up the rings, we asked Eric if he had taken a picture for his portfolio. He told us that he doesn't use a portfolio, because every custom ring should be unique, and he doesn't want couples coming in and picking one of those as their own.  I thought that was a wonderful thing...it shows how much he cares about his previous clients, and how much effort he will put into finding something unique and great for his future clients.

Fantastic!  They took a last minute reservation for 11 of us, no problem.  Table was ready when we arrived.  Wings were DELICIOUS.  Perfectly crispy.  Pizza was amazing too...love the thin crust.  The manager was so friendly and attentive the entire time, making us feel very welcome!  Can't wait to come back and have those wings again soon.

I had a very pleasant experience from the time I called to book an appointment, to the time I set foot out the door.  Having neglected my teeth for many years, I finally decided to get a cleaning and exam.  I had started off by going to an office near my house which had reaffirmed my distaste for dentists.  The dentist was cold, unfriendly, spent less than five minutes in the room with me, ridiculed me for waiting so long to get my teeth checked out, and made me feel like a lower class of human being for not being able to get the $1700 worth of work done I needed in one visit due to finances.  I left with frustration, shame, and worry.  Though I would have much rather called off my dental work at this point, I knew that I really needed to get a cleaning and fillings or things would only get worse.  I decided to try out Dr. Young's office after finding a Valpak coupon for a free exam and x-rays.  How lucky I was to have stumbled upon this, because I have found a wonderful dentist!  I called and made an appointment, and they conveniently got me in the same day.  Despite the exam being free, Dr. Young and his assistant Alice were extremely thorough and spent a lot of time with me.  He explained what I needed done, but also explained "why," which made it a lot easier to justify spending the money.  He answered all of my many questions without annoyance and was extremely friendly and personable, making conversation and talking about personal life as well.  Dr. Young created a treatment plan for me that spread out the fillings I need into multiple visits, making it easier for me to get the work done as I can afford it.  I had a cleaning the same day by Chris, who was wonderful.  Instead of shaming me for putting off a cleaning for years, she made me feel good about taking the step to finally come in.  She gave me samples, taught me how to floss and brush correctly (you think at 25 I'd have this down, but apparently I've been doing it wrong!), and made sure I was comfortable.    Overall, Dr. Young and his staff are amazing and I definitely give them five stars.

Poor service, incredibly slow ticket times, two order mess-ups, and a FREEZING cold dining room made for a horrible lunch experience.  Took thirty minutes for our app to come out.  Had to ask for lemons for our tea three times before the waitress remembered to bring them out.  When our lunch entrees arrived, my friend's bacon cheeseburger which she ordered with Swiss cheese (she originally wanted American, which is still listed as an option on the menu but which they no longer carry according to the server) was topped with cheddar instead.  She decided to tough it out until she realized the bun was soaking wet (gross??).  That got sent back.  My other friend's food came ten minutes after the rest of us recieved our entrees due to a kitchen error.  I had the balsalmic dressing with my salad and I highly suggest you stay away from that...tastes like a mess of straight vinegar and peppercorns.  And wear a sweater.  AZ is hot and all, but that doesn't mean the AC needs to be turned down to 40*.

Yummy!  A high quality sandwich on DELICIOUS bread.  Unlimited sides of sweet & hot peppers.

If you're in the mood for sushi, GO HERE!  Orient is amazing.  I've been coming here for 3 years and it's by far my favorite affordable sushi joint.    Their selection is good, and the prices are unbeatable.  My husband and I come here and make it out the door for under $20 for dinner (including tip).  On top of the great value, the sushi is always fresh and delicious.  I've never been disappointed in a roll.  And if you like fried rice, try the House Special Fried Rice.  It's incredible.  I'm surprised to see that some reviewers were disappointed in the service!  We have always received excellent service here, even when it's busy.  I'm glad to see Orient is still around & thriving, despite the failure of other restaurants in the complex.  I'm happy to be a patron of a local restaurant that goes above and beyond in the areas of value, service, and quality.  I'll be a customer for many years to come!

My husband and I come here every year on the anniversary of our first date.  Tony is always so welcoming and makes you feel like family.  It was exceptionally busy this year, but he still made it a point to come by, shake our hands, and say hello.  The service here is top notch, but of course that delicious pizza is the best part.  Perfectly thin and crispy (yet somehow still chewy) crust, yummy sauce, greasy but not too greasy...soooooo good.

Hubbard offers a Baby Splash swim class that is FREE until your baby reaches six months.  What a wonderful gift to the community!  Although we have a pool at home, I love that I am able to introduce my son to the water in a structured setting while he begins to learn the very basics of water safety.  The instructors are so patient and understanding whenever one of the babies just isn't having it, so there's no fear of being shamed if your teething infant decides he's cranky during class.  Wish there was a class available on the weekend so my husband could come, but like I said, it's FREE, so I definitely cannot complain.

Wow...wish that I would have checked my trusty Yelp prior to coming here.  Spent 52 minutes here; 30 of that was sitting watching the dirt water dry onto my car after it had been through the wash.  Eventually the employee responsible for finishing it got around to it, and then I got to watch him shoving peanuts and powerade into his face while half-assedly flinging a towel around my back windshield as if to dry it.  Bought the $20 VIP wash expecting that my car would come out looking shiny and fresh.  It wasn't that dirty to begin with.  But I would have been better served going to the $3 drive thru wash and drying it myself on the other end, because that's exactly what it looks like I did.  When they said my car was done, of course I noticed the water spots all over it and the smeared windshield and windows, but I figured I'd just windex them when I got home since I had been here almost an hour and was completely ready to get out of there.  Wish I would have further inspected the interior before leaving, because here is the horrendous part: my car is 3 weeks old...it's brand new and had (HAD) beautiful clean sparkling tan interior.  The lovely gentleman finishing my car must have used a DIRTY towel to apply the interior treatment, because I got home and realized there was black stuff smeared ALL OVER the once-lovely tan doors and dash.  I knew my tan trim was going to get dirty eventually, but I didn't expect it to be AFTER A CAR WASH!  What a joke.

I have been dreaming of BabyStacks since I left Las Vegas.  Literally, I had a dream I was swimming in a pool of cream cheese sauce.  We came to Vegas for a weekend getaway and stumbled upon this place.  We liked it so much on Saturday that we returned for breakfast on Sunday.  I'm sure if I lived there I'd go every day of the week and be a huge, fat pancake eating machine.  It's probably best that I live six hours away.    If you like orange, get the creamsicle pancakes.  The red velvet also won't disappoint.  My husband loved the fried rice wrapped in an egg (can't remember the name).  Until we meet again, BabyStacks...

This is my first pregnancy, and the MomDoc Midwives have been amazing throughout the whole thing.  The midwives are caring, knowledgeable, and thorough.  They treat new moms with the utmost respect.  They've answered all my many questions without making me feel silly for asking, which is a must when you have so many changes going on in your body and a new little life that you're protective of!    I love that they're a group practice with an intimate feel.  You get the best of both worlds this way.  You have the convenience and the perks that come along with being in a group practice, but they're small enough to where you can get to know each midwife individually and have a personal connection with whomever might deliver your baby.  I haven't delivered yet, but I'm confident that it will only reaffirm my five-star rating!  I feel like I am not only receiving excellent care, but that I have an advocate by my side when the time comes to deliver.  I would highly recommend MomDoc Midwives to anyone who is newly pregnant or trying to conceive!    Other good things to note: -They have a triage line with a nurse that you speak to immediately (no leaving messages and waiting to call back...which can be the worst when you think something's wrong!).  I'm not sure if someone answers immediately if you call after-hours, but they do have a 24/7 line. -They can often get you in for same-day appointments. -They have on-site labs and ultrasound (I can't imagine having to run all over town for these!) -I haven't experienced a wait-time in the waiting room of more than 10 minutes. -They have a group care model called BUMP where you have the opportunity to interact with other expectant moms and couples due the same month as you.
