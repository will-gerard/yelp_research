Met up with a new friend and an high school classmate there last night. Didn't feel like I was in Phoenix, which, no matter where you live, on occasion, can feel like a really good thing. More like being in Ess Eff...very urbane. Their crostini were great--brie and apple (not super imaginative, but still good), and ricotta/fig/pistachio--excellent. If you go on a 110+ day, be aware that their a/c system isn't up to handling it. We sweated it out last night until enough people left to help cool the place off. We're new to Phoenix, so we'll be trying the other La Grande Orange eateries on that corner.

I am a fan and Yay! for that. We moved from the Seattle area, where we got fresh uni (sea urchin), periwinkles, a special kind of pepper you can only get in Kyoto...oh, and we've been to Japan twice...should I go on? We're spoiled, in short. We've tried a handful of places and were rightly impressed with Sea Saw, but can't afford that on a regular basis (and it was a little too western for us--better for special occasions). We've tried Got Sushi now a few times, and every time is better than the last. It's nowhere near the caliber of sushi we're used to, but you can tell that they aim high and seek out the best fish they can get their hands on/afford. Our faves last time were a kind of "without rice" roll, spicy tuna roll, maguro and wild salmon. The last time we were there we had "erotic" sake cups...when the glass is filled you can see, you can guess, right? We're careful to drive when we can handle it, but we're also incredibly grateful that this is right in our 'hood, since driving at night and cameras and Sheriff Joe, well, it's all a bit much isn't it?

This place gets 2 stars because the building itself is trippy and cool--check out the blue window skylights in a Gaudi esque configuration--and the super fresh salsa. My lunch, on the other hand, was super lackluster (a la carte spinach enchilada and chile relleno). But I'll go back, just for margaritas, kick ass salsa, and a building that sets a cool mood.

The pizza was excellent...not the best in the country, however. That honor should go to Via Tribunali in Seattle. The crust was perfect, the biancoverde pizza our favorite. Why 2 stars? We arrived at 5:45 p.m. on a blistering 113 degree Saturday night and were told we would be seated in 2-3 hours. Ok. Not great, but ok. The scam is that you have to wait at their bar next door or be forced to check in every hour. By their time calculations we should have been seated around 8:15 p.m. Guess when we sat down to dinner, folks? 9:30 p.m. We spent that time spending $$ in their not-so-well-cooled bar with not very many seats. Nice way to get 2 tabs out of one evening, restaurant owners! Once we were seated in the actual restaurant, we also sat at a bar. We love bar seating--however, this bar has one side with leg room, the other side has no leg room. Our awesome luck continuing, I was wearing a skirt, and guess which side we were seated at? It was not a good arrangement. Their waiters didn't feel like waiters, more like expediters working the floor. After suffering through the indignity of an outrageously long wait, one of these expediters didn't approach us for another 10 minutes. Now it's 9:40-ish. Finally we get service, which was on the gruff side. I still can't sit at the bar quite right, so when a couple leaves the other side of the bar (the side that has leg room), I approach the manger to see if we can move. Perhaps a tiny victory, but a victory nonetheless. We spend the next 20 minutes talking about the very good pizza in an set up that hucks the bucks from those who wait...and everyone does. Even though we enjoyed the pizza, we won't be going back. Tip: the bald bartender said their slowest season/slowest nights were May-September, Wednesdays and Thursdays. If you must, go once to get it out of your system. If you're a glutton for punishment, then you have found your favorite new restaurant.

I'm with the other Yelpers on this one. We live in Far East Mesa/Las Sendas area (renting a condo--wouldn't it be great to buy right now?), and have gone to Got Sushi twice and enjoyed it. Since we hadn't been to Zushi, we thought we should at least give it a shot. Let's just say we were there for about 20 minutes with a $22.00 tab. It was painful. The people that work there are nice, but they're trapped in a land where every word that has an "s" in it has been replaced with a "z." As in, Restroomz, Ladiez, Gentlemenz, Saladz, Soupz, Appetizerz. Should I go on? : ) The menu is outrageously long for a restaurant of its size. The food? Their spicy tuna roll--this is our test--wasn't too bad. But the maguro was very average. I would imagine the sushi at AJs might even be superior. The mackerel was passable, but that's not a good sushi bar test. As for the atmosphere, the restaurant felt more like a bar w/ side restaurant, with techno-lite muzak throbbing in the background, just loud enough to be irritating. But looking at the crowd, I don't think we're their target audience. Dads with young daughters and 2nd marriage trophy wives, young teens, all of which--I'm guessing here--don't know that much about sushi or Japanese food...now they, they looked like they were having a good time. If you know even a little bit about sushi and traditional Japanese food save yourself the time and money and head right to Got Sushi. When we got to Got Sushi, it was a relief. Oh, and we got served sake in really fun sake glasses that reveal less than clothed bodies at the bottom. Boisterous and good--I owe Got Sushi a great review now.

A disaster. We were told it would be an hour wait. No problem. It was a little over an hour, but still, no problem. It's 8:35 pm. No waiter until 9 pm. Nothing. Nada. Then, we tried to order a bottle of wine. Selection #1: "Oh, we're out of." Selection # 2: "Let me see..." "No, we're out of that one. My husband gamely tries another selection. They come back with "We're out of that as well. Perhaps you might like the merlot?"   The food arrives, blessedly, quickly. It's mediocre Indian. We've lived in major metropolitan areas and just weren't impressed. The menu, at first glance, IS impressive. But the food was just above average.  One last note. The alley-shaped space is a noise box. Be prepared to yell your thoughts across the table. So much for a nice night out.  **UPDATE** The owner offered us a dinner in response to our disappointment. We responded that, rather than that, that he ensure that no future diners experienced what we experienced. I'll give him another star for trying to remedy the situation :  )

We had a friend in town and were searching for the right place to just hang out and talk...Tuck Shop had that and more. It was pretty hard to find...you drive down a neighborhood street and really can't make out a house that looks like a restaurant until you turn the corner. The retooled house is a marvel--very thoughtful design details--pocket doors, acoustic ceiling, compelling lounge area, etc. On to the food. The plates are meant for sharing, and they all struck the right note. In particular the mac and cheese and the fontina cheesesticks with 2 dipping sauces. Better than we expected. Now, it does have the "LATFH" vibe and a lot of them in there too, but, no matter. They know to search out cool places and they didn't spoil our time there. Bonus points for making us feel like we were in SF vs. Phoenix. We do like Phoenix, but it's a rare restaurant that transports us out of the city's strange mix of spas, poverty, Hummers, urban blight, Scottsdale strip bars, and religious/gun-toting/conservative wack jobs. Need an escape? Highly recommended.

Been here twice and enjoyed both of our experiences. The setting is pretty urban feeling for far east Mesa--grateful for that. The wine list is pretty unusual...lots of wines and grapes you've never heard of since the owner is from...Hungary? Can't remember, but the wine selection benefits from his extensive knowledge of that region.   The fried chicken--patented, no less--was really something. Spicy and brined to fall off the bone. The pasta dishes are good as well, with portions expected in a urban restaurant (don't expect Claim Jumper portions).   All in all a great place to sit, savor dinner and talk. Waitstaff is on a learning curve, and you benefit, since the restaurant is new and they bend over backwards, service-wise. Highly recommended!
