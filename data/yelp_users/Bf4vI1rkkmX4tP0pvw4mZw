I love this place.  I love that it's rich with history (for Arizona) and the fact it was two houses, connected.  The interior is beautiful, and wooden. There's a Trolly in the middle, which is always a treat to be able to sit in.   The service is usually stellar, in fact, the last young lady (I feel awful for forgetting her name) not only joked along with us, but we danced the Charleston together!   I've been coming to this place since I was a child, and I was devastated to find out it's a chain. But this particular location earns it's credibility back with the great history, and the consistent food and service.   Anywhere I go, I hold the Mizithra standard to This location. I always eat too much, and never regret it.   It's always nice to know there is a scoop of ice cream for desert after, especially when connecting with old friends, and wanting time to leisurely chat over desert.   I will continue to visit, and enjoy myself at the Old Spaghetti Factory.   (Side note: I recently went on a Haunted Bus tour of Phoenix, and apparently this location is Haunted by the ghost of a child, who like to poke people in the behind! I have never experienced it, but watch your fanny! haha)

I like Rositas. They are affordable, and the food is always consistent.   The lunch specials are awesome, I recommend burritos enchilada style. The chips were a little stale, but that's par for the course for most Mexican restaurants.    The waitress we had this past visit was amazing. She was engaging, but not intrusive. Our drinks were always full, and she even offered "To Go" drinks...   My mother and I were catching up after a while, a she didn't chase us out of the booth, and even continue to offer refills on our iced Tea after we closed out the tab.   One of these days, my husband and I should split something, so we have room for desert because I saw a plate of fried Ice cream walk by, and it looked delicious.

I love this place.  I love the vintage decor, the attached antique stores, and the overall feeling of the place.  As most of the reviews reference, McAlpines has been open since 1928 and is said to be the only surviving soda shop to make it through the Great Depression.   The staff is young, and hipster. Many sporting victory rolls or Betty Bangs. They offer great soda recommendations and are are attentive and quick.   Their food is consistent and classic. No frills, no fuss and great taste. The potato salad is awesome. I always order an extra side of it.   Their deserts are killer. Chocolate fudge for miles. My husband had a root-beer float which he swears is the best he's ever had.   There old fashioned soda fountains alter the taste of your traditional coke but for the better. They also have a ton of phosphates to choose from. Try the cherry. It's my favorite.   I hope this little place continues on for generations as a institution the the days gone by...

What's interesting about reviewing an Airport -  is a) you don't really have options and b) It's sometimes hard to separate airline experience vs. airport experience since they work hand in hand.   The Airport has some neat art work near the ticket counters. I wish I could spend time admiring it, but even if you're several hours early, you can never "relax" until you've made it all the way through security. I'd encourage them to move the art pieces to the terminal so people waiting for flights, post-security can enjoy them.   TSA and Security is what it is... they haven't caught any Terrorists yet, but I'll be darned, if I don't have to produce 16 different notarized documents to bring my insulin on the plane with me. I wish we didn't have to take off our shoes, because it encourages poor footwear choice, especially if you arrive somewhere where you have to walk pretty far to get to your connection and/or front door.   Once you're in the terminal, I have to hand it to Sky Harbor. They restaurant selection is robust. Everything from burgers, coffee and Mexican Food, to McDonalds, and NYPD pizza. Yes, everything is a little more expensive, but you don't have a choice, and you will pay for it.   The staff is mostly pleasant, and helpful. I wish the bathrooms had more places to hang things and/or a shelf to store your rolling suitcase while you went potty - but that's a pipe dream.   To quote another reviewer "Planes come in. Planes go out." and they entertain you in the meantime.

Went here for a rehearsal dinner for a wedding. The food was great, the service was great, the drinks were great.   We ate outside and the view was spectacular.   I'm a little bummed I missed out on the infamous slide, but next time for sure.   My biggest issue was parking. Even on a Thursday night we had drive around for quite a while to find a spot. It was tough because our car contained a toddler, and a 7 months pregnant woman and we has to hoof it pretty far. Maybe a shuttle service from lower level parking would help.

My brother loves this place.  Apparently on account of the lunch specials.   The Service was okay. Our poor waitress was about 10 months pregnant, and I hated asking her for anything. They bring your food out on carts which is different, but made me feel better for our waitress. (did I mention she was practically crowning!)   The chips were stale, when we asked for a fresher batch she said "they're all from yesterday so they are the same" - Kudos for your honestly, I suppose.   The food was... bland, and boring. Even with the 7 dollar price tag, including drink and desert, it was not worth it.   It's now an ongoing joke any time we go out to eat with my brother, "Anything but Si Senors"

I like small businesses.  I like low prices.  This place is both - and I still don't like it.   They carry cheesy, plastic jewelry which has come in handy a few times for theater but other than that most of the jewelry is to be desired.   It's usually pretty dim in there, and the owner always smells strongly of stale smoke.  She posts photos of shoplifters she caught on the wall - whereas I understand what she's trying to do - it makes me feel weird.   And to be honest, the owner is... well she's rude. She seems to think she's doing all of us a favor by BEING there - which I suppose is true. Her prices are ROCK BOTTOM for cheap watch batteries, and simple jewelry repair. But at this point in my life, I'd prefer to pay a little more for better (less pungent) service.

This vet has taken care of my family pets since I can remember.  Before retiring Doctor Rick retired he took great care of each my families pets, especially at their end of life. He took great care of their remains and the emotional needs of my mother.   His sons now take care of the practice and they are just as exceptional as their father.   I love this vets clinic.

I love this costume shop.  Having basically grown up in the theatre I needed costume after costume.   The rentals are well taken care of and alterations are easy.   The for purchase costumes are a little more expensive then some of the other Halloween stores but they offer them year round which is nice.   I only rated 4 stars because it used to be better  Before the new owners took over many years ago... I felt more valued.  The new owners seemed a little less capable and spend money on the wrong items.   Still. A year round costume store that was once a bank is pretty awesome.

This used to be an exceptional location for a morning drink fix. Since changing owners, the quality has started on a steady decline.   The once fresh coffee is stale and cool.  I don't know if they are selling less or not changing it as often but it isn't as good.   The one immaculate soda fountain area is now sticky and messy like every other gas station convince store.   The fact you have to ask someone to choose your hot dog for you is also weird. I'm so disappointed I wanted to give it one star but since there is no other convenient drink stop for me, I'm adding the extra star as hope for a brighter tomorrow.

I have so much respect for the Discount Tire business model.  Free air checks, Free Repairs, Free Tire Rotations... where else would I got to buy tires?   They aren't always the cheapest on the block (I'm positive if I checked Cost Co and/or Sams club would be cheaper)   But they always take good care of me, and my car.  They've replaced spares for me, for next to nothing. They've managed to repair tires that I thought were LONG gone, and stayed open an extra 15 minutes for an emergency once.   I've "shoed" all 3 of my cars at Discount, and don't plan to ever take my business elsewhere.   These guys work hard, but you'd never know it. Always positive, always upbeat, I even heard the guys singing in the garage the other day (Singing, and laughing lol) Thank you discount Tire for always keeping me on the road.

This is the perfect little family owned deli.   I have fond memories of yoohoos and turkey sandwiches.   I wish there was a way to rate them 4.9 stars because cash only is a bit of a pain but I understand it is expensive to run credit and debit.   Thank you for the fond memories and I look forward to the new senior photos from saguaro every year.

Nothing quite like comfort food.   This Denny's is always clean and comfortable. The food is consistent and the service is always amazing.   They run our of apple crisp a lot but if they have it order it and enjoy.   Additionally the revamp of the interior is beautiful.

This location has such spectacular memories for me. Having hosted many fundraisers for Scottsdale Desert Stages (my home away from home)   I love the support this location has for their community.   Also they never shy away from offering Military discounts. My husband and I showed up after he had drill in uniform and they offered a discount for us both.   I also love their cream of broc soup. It is what I hold all other soups too :)

My husband and I love this little dive.  The drinks are strong and affordable.  Cash only is a little irritating but as long as you prepare for it, it isn't a big deal.   I love the Jukebox and since it has a lot of "Now Music" albums there is something for everyone.

This place is magic.  Having participated in shows with the Theatre from about 1995 to about 2004  I now make a point of seeing several shows a year, in both "The Actors Cafe" and "The Main Stage Theatre"   It's Community Theatre to the very core.  Getting the whole family involved in "Community Day" and letting parents get involved as "Back stage Moms" or  non acting siblings work as "techies"   It's truly beautiful to see such a close knit team of individuals.

Mimi's Cafe is one of those mid-priced restaurants, that could be considered a "Nice Night out..." or Exciting "Brunch Experience" --- but they're lacking, and I can't quite put my finger on where.   I love their muffins. Whatever bakery they ship those bad boys from, I wish I could buy whole sale. They are spectacular.   That being said, the rest of their menu comes with Fancy French names, Fancy French Prices, and American diner quality.   My Grandmother is a big fan of this place, so I do spend a lot of nights here with her. It seems to be a happening place for the 65+ crowd. Even as late as 7pm!   Every once in a while they celebrate by lowering certain menu prices to their price in the 70s which is great (59 cent muffins! I bought a dozen!)   I'm by no means a food snob, but please Mimis... if you're going to charge 12 dollars for a omelet, I shouldn't be tasting imitation cheddar.

This is one of my favorite spots to sneak out for lunch. The lunch specials are amazing. I'm a big fan of the 2 tacos, or the Taco and the cheese Enchilada.  In a small group setting, the service is amazing.   However, once time I brought my Team from work (10 members) in for an off-site lunch meeting. I made reservations several days in advance.   They brought us to the back of the restaurant, and it took a solid 10 minutes for someone to come by with water. Then took several more long moments to bring our drink orders. Once we finally ordered our food, it took near 40 minutes for everyone to get served (this is including one member of my team who had to wait an additional 5 or so minutes from the rest of my group)  The food was still delicious, and very affordable. We were just disappointed in the service for a large group.   All in all, this is a great lunch spot, with consistent and delicious food. Just don't bring a big group.

I love this little Theater.  I've now seen two different productions on their main stage and both times have been blown away.   They theater is small, and intimate, and makes amazing use of the space. I love the projections. Makes it feel very "Broadway"   The talent pool is exceptional. I have been impressed by (nearly) every actor or actress to grace the stage.   The building is inviting, and the donations wine bar is wonderful. I enjoy the production photos, and head shots before going into the show.   Also, I feel this is one of the few theaters that had accommodating number of rest rooms for the intermission rush.  I look forward to returning to see another show, and bringing all my friends!   Thanks for all the moments !!!

The name is cheesy and doesn't quite demand the same instant respect as Tiffany's or Shane Company but the service and jewelry are both exceptional.   My husband found my engagement and wedding band set at this location and was so impressed at the service and quality.   Even years after ... We walk in for a routine inspection and the girls recognize My husband and greet him by name.   I consistently get compliments on my wedding set, many people asking if it is vintage due to the sculpted nature of it.   If you are getting engaged and your girlfriend isn't so obsessed with labels and brands... This is the perfect location to get a fantastic deal on quality jewelry.   Ask about the warranties too. Keeps my ring sparking and in good shape :)

Southwest is my airline.  I've always preferred them.   There are no assigned seats, which is a curse and a blessing.  A blessing in the case of showing up early you have your choice.  A curse, if you run a hair late, you're split up.   We are rapid rewards members, and have Chase Visa cards - which means we are frequently sent drink vouchers. I know this isn't a huge deal, but it makes us feel valued. Sometimes it isn't the dollar value of the gesture, but the casual reminder of "Hey we know you choose us, and we hope you continue to do so..."   We've had pretty good luck with baggage, very few flights that require connections, and overall very kind staff.   In fact, this last jump from Georgia to Phoenix, we had a snag at the drop off for the rental car, and arrived at the gate about 1 minute before they were going to close the doors. They had someone WITH OUR BOARDING PASSES waiting for us, so we could walk right on. We expected to be turned away, not be treated like royalty.   Thank you for always getting us to and from safe Southwest.

I took some bad advice, when I put a plastic backing on a nose ring and it got stuck.    Ana didn't make me feel stupid, or scold me.  She spent a significant amount of time removing the backing, and going over the health consiquences of adding to body piercings.   This is TWICE Ana has saved me from my own stupidity - and fixed bad piercings.   In the past, I got 00 silicon plugs stuck in my ears, and she painstakingly removed them piece by piece.   Ana is a piercing Angel (and seriously sexy to boot!) She always makes me feel like we are old friends, and takes amazing care of me.   AND Halo has the most amazing selection of jewerly.  I get all of my nose rings from Halo.

I have not used Maids of Honor but I tried too several months ago. The woman I spoke to on the phone was pleasant and friendly. She asked great probing questions to find out the level of cleaning we needed. My only concern was, I lead the conversation with "I can only do weekends or Wednesday" and she presented me with "Tuesday or Thursday" when I mentioned Wednesday or weekends again she said "We are booked Wednesday" so I said "weekend it is..." And it was at this point she mentioned they do not clean on weekends.   Oh.  Could have saved me some time by leading with that. I'm glad you give your staff weekends off, but it isn't common and I'm sorry I assumed. But a bit of active listening practice can go a long way.

This was my families favorite spot for dinner.  Graduation? Julio Gs Family in Town? Julio Gs Meet the new Boyfriend? Julio Gs  The Polli Magnifico was to DIE for. I got it almost every single time.  There are multiple places who try to capture the magic, and fall short.   Every single time I drive by their old location, I feel a little sad inside.  There "To Go" Julio 2's just isn't the same.  Nor is their location in Paradise Valley.   RIP Scottsdale Julio G's

My husband and I went in for a 1 buzz and a bang trim. It's hard to mess up a buzz so my husband is fine but my bangs are a crying shame. She hardly wet them down even though I has them pulled to the side do the length. They're crooked and there are multiple stands that are too long. I had to fix them myself with kitchen scissors before I would leave the house. It's a shame. This location is usually pretty good.

This is the greatest vegan restaurant I have ever had the pleasure of visiting.   Most vegan restaurant offer the same fare - tofu with various sauces with a smattering of rice, here and there.   Green takes Vegan cuisine to a new level. Some of the best mock chicken I have ever had.  Everything down to the ice cream.   The staff is always willing to customize and offer suggestions.  I love this restaurant.

I'm not a big fan if this grocery store.  It's loud and usually pretty dirty.   I feel like a lot of the produce is pretty bruised and damaged.    The selection is limited but the prices are good.   They have a nice selection of Mexican foods and spices which is really nice.  Additionally I love the full sugar Mexican sodas.

give the choice between this Taco Bell... I'd take Taco Bell any day of the week.  The food was Hot, but that's really it.  and I don't mean spicy, I mean tempture wise.   The chips were about a day shy of stale, and the carne asada was so tough I could hardly bit all the way through it.   For Las Vegas being known for their quality cusine, this is a BAD example.   I don't think my husband and I will be staying at Circus Circus ever again, so hopefully we won't be forced to eat here again.

The food here is your average American-Mexican food.   There are always Chips and salsa. If you're lucky enough to get a fresh batch they are wonderful.  I love that they don't cake them with salt.   The food is consistent and spicy. Their carne asada is my favorite.   But the reason we continue to visit is a certain waiter named Kevin. He is exceptional. Upbeat, enthused and never ever let's a cup run dry. He makes you feel special and continues to provide excellent service. He deserves a raise.

The food is delightful.  Make sure if its your first time you ask for help. Use an extra bowl instead of the "pushing paper"   Food is always fresh and usually pretty high quality. I love the wheat noodles and creating my own sauces. The tofu is always delightful.   4 stars because the prices keep going up and up and up... And the bowls get smaller and smaller.

My husband and I love an afternoon wasted at Ikea, and we always stop for lunch at their cafe. Today Shane and I were ravished so we picked up a little of everything and shared.   First, sweetish meatballs. Always a favorite. Though they have introduced some kind of lingonberry "pump" which dispenses the lingonberries which leads to it being more runny juice than an actual "relish" or "chutney". They've also drastically cut down the mashed potato portion, which it was still lovely.   The side of Mac and Cheese. There is something so comfortable about their Mac...  Which can only be described as hospital gourmet. I know that sounds awful but it really isn't. I love it. I always want to take some home but it never makes it.   The buffalo chicken wrap. This is my husband favorite dish. I'm not a huge fan so he ate most of this dish. They are served cold and hubs said something was off today. No foul since we ordered too much anyways.   The caprese salad.  I don't know if this is new or if I have missed it before but it was just delightful. The tomatoes were fresh and crisp, the mozzarella tasted pretty fresh, the basil was green and inviting. The amount of balsamic vinegar was just perfect.   We also got a piece of chocolate cake which was too rich to finish. Maybe more cake and less mouse?   But here is the most exceptional part of our day, a young lady by the name of Anastasia. As I was checking out she let me know there was a deal going on, if I got back and get MORE food I'd save 2 dollar. Now we certainly didn't need more food but she voluntarily saved us money.  We took the chips home and passed on the soup.    I don't know I'd Miss Anastasia is ever on yelp but its small things you so that made you so exceptional. Continue to be a positive ray of sunshine in a usually thankless job!!

This place is amazing.  I am by no means a German Food critic - nor do I know what German food is "supposed" to taste like, but hopefully this is it, because it's amazing.  My husband was stationed in Germany for 6 Years, and he loves it... so I trust his opinion.   I love the beer, I love the spatzel, I LOVE the snitzel.   I bring everyone to Haus Murphy I can, because everything is amazing.  A few times, I brought my parents and there was a polka bang being amazing in the bar area.   I love this resturant.

This is a great store.  I love the concept of organic cosmetics.  The bath bombs are fun to demo in the store. I bought a few for my honeymoon. They didn't last very long and were a little less exciting in practice.   I love their body washes, and shampoos. Though some of the stoute based ones are a little too beerish.   I also love their solid perfumes. Anything jasmine based. They tend to last longer than traditional sprays.   The only reason I rated this store a 4 is the costs seem to keep increasing. It's getting harder and harder to stay organic with "green culture" being more and more hip.

I must be the one person who doesn't "get" this place. Maybe I don't like British food? Maybe I don't like loud music, and poor service?   We visited this place to celebrate my girlfriend Sarah's 30th Birthday. We were seated outside because it was SO loud inside, we didn't think we would be able to hear ourselves think. The waitress too a bit too long to greet us, or even take our drink orders. Our food took even longer.   I split the Cottage Pasty with my friend, and my half was chilly in the middle. That aside, pasty is NOT my cup of tea.   I ordered the PB&J pasty for desert thinking maybe that would be more up my ally, but it was an odd mix of flavor, and still not my thing.   I didn't drink,  but I may consider coming back to check out their tap because it seemed impressive, but I will eat BEFORE I come.

With Netflix, On Demand, and Red Box I'm not a huge patron of movie theaters.   That being said, this Christmas my husband and I received multiple movie passes, which means we are off to the theater.   We caught a matinee today. The lines were very short.  The woman at the window, Donna was exceptional. Made conversation about my husbands Star Wars wallet, and even offered to put our multiple gift cards onto one card which was amazing. (Now we only have ONE harkins card to keep track of!)   The theater it's self is HUGE. High Ceilings. HUGE Snack area. Random movie posters and paraphernalia.  Really no different than any other movie theater.   Like I mentioned before, The hubs and I don't go out for movies a lot, so I was shocked that the already high movie snack prices have gotten even worse. We had free pop corn, and shared a large drink and still paid 5.50. Harkins is HUGE on the up-sale. WE had coupons for medium pop corns, and tried to get us to upgrade those. Can't blame a chain for trying. Especially in a world of instant gratification.   I will hand it to Harkins. I seem to prefer their seating. The right amount of leg room, and very comfortable. Plenty of room for me, my gigantic purse, and our comically large soda.  I love sitting in the first row of the stadium, so I can put my feet on the bars. Movie theaters should realize EVERYONE wants to put their feet up, and install bars on the back of all their seats.   Same old movable arm rest, and the movies are the same.   I prefer Harkins. They are my "home town" movie theater. Their prices are high, but so is everyone else.   I'm a little miffed their loyality cups refills went up to 1.50 Remember to grab a dollar cash was easy, a dollar fifty is a pain.

I've spent a bit of time at this bar.  Ended up here on nights that Four Peaks was too busy.   The few times I've eaten, I've shamed my Irish Ancestors with my lack of ability to enjoy the Traditional Irish Breakfast (I did taste the blood sausage, and tasted it again on the way up! Ugh! but I tried it! ) Nor the Shepards pie, which I am usually a HUGE fan of.   But this is a bar - so the food is meh.   The selection of beers and wines are awesome.  I don't drink a whole lot of spirits, but my husband always gets excited that "his wiskey" is there, and adoradable.   I like the ambiance a lot more when there ISN'T live music, because I can't hardly hear myself think when someone is performing.   The patio is fantastic for smokers, and the misters keep it nice and cool.

After many more trips, they've won we move. They take reservations which is great for post work cocktails.  And I've fallen in love with their pork sliders and garlic french fries. There is green sauce that comes with the fries which I wish I could bottle. Mmmmm!   Wait staff hustles and always keeps your drinks full.

This is my morning drink spot.  Not the cheapest on the block, but directly across from my office building.  They have a stamp card, purchase 5 Sodas and the 6th is free, which averages out the prices. Plus its nice to have a bonus morning, where I pay nothing.   I've yet to use their car wash services, but I think I should give them a shot.  The staff in the store are all exceptional.

This review is specifically for an employee named David. He is not only efficient and friendly, but took such good care of everyone who came into his store  The stand out moment was an older woman with a walker ordering some lunch. David took her order. Walked her to a seat and offered to bring her her tray. On top of that he brought her mustard and ketchup and came by to refill her drink.  He had consistent people trying to order but took time for the elderly. David if I had any cash I would has tipped you and made sure you really understand that your efforts do not go unnoticed. Thank you for going above and beyond!!

Someone from the shoppe  reached out to me, and thinks I may be confusing her shop with another location (since she states there aren't any men working in her shop) since I check in, and review later - there is a chance  I checked in at the wrong nail shop.  To be fair, I will temporarily giving them 5 stars, and will get my next mani at this shop and make sure it's the correct location.   It's true, even the elite make mistakes. Stay posted...

I'm a little indifferent and hurt by this doctor's office.  The office staff has made me cry several times because they are so blunt and insensitive. I've been on a medication treating metabolic syndrome from an endocrinologist, and one day the office calls to tell me "You need to keep taking your medication for your diabetes" - Yes, metformin is used to treat diabetes but please familiarize yourself with WHAT my medication is treating before you call me and take a guess. They are hard to get a hold of, and quote blunt. I don't like calling them if I can help it.   Genieve, the first PA I saw was fantastic. She listened, made me feel valued, and even tried to help me with a weight loss supplement. I really connected with her, but I don't know what happened, but I never got to see her again when they closed one of their offices.   Sadly, for whatever reason, my appointments started being scheduled with another PA, Brandi who I am slightly less enchanted with.  She seems very focused on selling Protandim and whatever her "Five years' worth of therapy in a short time" online forum than listening to my concerns.  She's very natural, which has its place in medicine, but I think she's too far in the wrong direction.  I found it weird she sent me home with a list of movies to watch about Food, and books I should read about being a vegetarian. At one point she told me my Anti-depressants were a crutch and I needed to get off them. I trusted her and tried to go cold turkey and had a severe mental issues going cold turkey on anti-depressants (which, I've read later is a REALLY REALLY bad idea)  at my next appointment she said "Oh what I meant was, you should open yourself up to the possibility of no longer needing the drugs"    If that's what you meant, you should have said that.  At another appointment, I came to her practically begging for a referral to a therapist because I was starting to scare myself with the feelings I was having, and she balked at me. I told her I though I may be Bi-Polar or schizophrenic, which she laughed at me and said, I don't think your schizophrenic, but I'll get you a referral if that's what you really want.  Two weeks later, I had a mental break, ended up in a psychiatrist's office, and guess what? I'm now being treated for schizophrenia.  I went to a follow up from her referral (To a Doctor with a SIX WEEK waiting period) mostly to tell her how let down and abandoned I felt by her, and again she made me cry. I wanted her to admit she was wrong, and she missed something I thought was very obvious, but she didn't admit fault, and sort of danced around the issue. She hugged me, and I guess that was supposed to fix it.   I'm changing primary care doctors. I wanted someone open to natural approaches, not one who practically ignores medicine in favor of a vegetarian diet.

I visit this QT every single day.  Everyone is nice and chipper willing to help.   They even remind me when I forget to tell them I brought my old cup in.   Seriously... QT is always clean, well lit and I always feel safe.   Three cheers Quick Trip!

Stopped in when I broke a nail and my regular place was closed already.   Great repair, great conversation and it was done very quickly.   If my regular place is ever closed again I will certainly visit NY Nails again.

My friend at work just loves this place.  I'm not blown away by Flo's but it isn't bad.  The salad dressing is wonderful, and I wish I could buy it by the bottle.   The food isn't spectacular (though I will admit I am not always adventurous when it comes to Chinese food)   The service is usually pretty good, though this last time, I think the gentleman was new because he was ALL over us, and then we didn't see him again for nearly 30 minutes. But I'm sure once he's more comfortable he'll be a great addition.

This was our go to bar for a while. Lots of interesting brews on tap including a few "custom" mixed including "Booty Sweat" which has an amazing fruity tang to it.   For a bar the food is amazing. There nachos have pepperoni on them which now makes me feel my nachos have been lacking my entire life.   Trivia night is too loud to enjoy but a fun concept.   Always busy but lots of fun.

There is something so comforting about silvermines. It reminds me of living at home with my parents and ordering in on a Friday night and watching movies.   There food isn't earth shattering by any means. But the sandwiches are consistent and customizable.   They are open and making sandwiches until 3am which is amazing. Perfect for lazy nights in, or a sobering late night snack.   I love that they deliver fountain drinks and pretty much anything else.   I will continue to order here any time I'm job Scottsdale visiting my folks.

I adore this Mexican food place.  The food is enjoyable, and always consistent.  The Pollo Fondito is my favorite. Just the right amount of spice and LOTS AND LOTS of cheese.  The wait staff is kind, and friendly.   The drinks are amazing. I love all of their margaritas. (those that I have tried anyways LOL)   But my favorite part about this location is the building. Everything is so colorful and campy, and just beautiful. My husband thinks it's tacky, but I just adore it.   I had a friend who was married here years ago, and it's just a beautiful location.

I. Love. This. Place.   Everything about this place is fun, and exciting.  The food is amazing. My husband and I like all kinds of sushi. From store bought to fine dining. Geisha a Go Go sits right on the higher end of middle range sushi.   When you first walk in, an assortment of Japanses video games line the walls. The dining room is trendy, and there are lots of different types of seating, including the bar.  The drink specials are always good, and some of their signature drinks are spectacular.   They even have karaoke rooms you can rent! Seriously! How amazing is that!  From what I hear they run around 200 dollars which is an amazing steal for the experience.   I know it's geeky, but I love the Japanese toilets. I can't tell you have many times I beg my husband to buy us one, but apparently they are "expensive" and "not a necessity"   I've had date nights with the hubs, bachlorette parties, birthday partys, happy hours, and family gatherings at this place, and it never stops being a good time.   Next time you're in, order a Hello Kitty. It will change your life.

This Wafflehouse is right across the street from our house.   We love this place.  The staff is friendly, the food is consistent. They always have apple butter at the table, instead of hoarding it in the back, only to be distributed to people who order raisin toast. The bacon is always perfectly crispy, but not burnt.  I always order the All Star Platter, because it comes with a little of everything. I wish I could make my made at home grits taste like weefy-ho.   It's VERY clean by diner standards. I saw some booths being bused, and they wiped EVERYTHING down.   Our only grievance is how often they run out of chocolate pie. My husband and I, traditionally, start out our Wafflehouse meals with chocolate pie. Don't know why, just always have. However, this location seems to always be sold out (Perhaps we talk about our tradition too often lol) But I'm sorry, Pecan pie just doesn't cut it.   Of course we will be back, we can WALK here, and everyone knows our name.

I love this grocery store.  Small portions perfect for my family.   I love their "clearance" items which dictate my meals some nights.   They are like the convenience stores of grocery stops and I couldn't be happier.   I also have their friends card and feel like I get coupons in the mail on a weekly basis.

This is my laundromat.  There are plenty of machines, washers of all sizes.  The staff is nice and helpful.   There are always plenty of magazines and televisions are usually on cooking shows which I love haha.   Their dryer prices are great. My favorite part.

I love chipotle.  Their food is so fresh and tasty.   The only thing I dislike are the peppers ... They're always dry and taste metallic.  I just avoid them but the rest if their food is epic.

I love quick trip.  They just added hot food to the already amazing offering.   Honestly, it reminds me a bit of the Wawa I recently visited in PA. The touch screen order system for the hot food. I wish they had sandwiches like Wawa.   This location is always clean, and there are serious amounts of hustle from the staff.   This is my morning drink stop, and was Ecstatic to move back to a neighborhood with a quick trip on my morning commute.  Also, after 4pm all pastries are half off.  I love hitting the pastry jackpot and getting a muffin on the way home.   QT for life!!

My OBGYN does not have ultrasound equipment in office, so I was sent to this office for my very first ultrasound.  This is my first pregnancy, and naturally I'm nervous, so I brought my husband. I even told the girl I booked my appointment with that I was bringing my husband. The girl told me to I needed a full bladder, and to drink about "20oz of water"   We arrived at the appointment, me being an over-achiever, drank 32oz of water, and I was excited to see the first flickering image of my child-to-be.  We were called back shortly, and the woman said,   "He can't come back here. Only you."  When I asked why she said,   "I have the right to only allow the patient, since guests ask too many questions"   I am not an idiot. I understand she is a tech, and not a doctor, she isn't allow to confirm diagnosis, or give ANY details but disallowing my husband in the room was unnerving.   I imagine this woman might have been hardened by people asking her too many questions, but never have I encountered a colder human being.    Turns out I should have drank the water an hour in advance, no one told me this. She reprimanded me, and said, "More than likely I won't be able to see anything"  I laid down, and was watching the screen, when she noticed I was watching the screen, she moved it away from my view.   I tried to make conversation since I was literately shaking with nerves, and she gave me blunt, single word answers.  The worst part is she made some of the most horrific faces as she was doing my ultrasound. For someone who "can't tell me anything..." her face made me ever more anxious and terrified. She did nothing to calm my nerves. I tried several times to make conversation, or just be talked to ... but she wouldn't.  This woman destroyed what should have been an amazing experience with my husband. I cried for a very long time afterwards.  Why is being a decent human so rare these days?

Southtown is what dentistry should be.  Inviting and comfortable waiting room (seriously their chairs are exceptional... I want one!) Rhonda welcomes you in like you're old friends and makes you feel valued and appreciated.   On my first visit Rhonda takes you on a tour of the office, and introduces you to anyone you come across   From the Dental Assistant to Doctor Nelson.... I was constantly blown away at their patience, skill and charm.   Each tool and procedure was explained to me in detail because I asked.  They even provide sunglasses so that the dental light doesn't shine in your eyes.  I'm fortunate to have good dental history, and require little more than bi-yearly check ups and the occasional filling. I wish I had more problems because I felt so comfortable in Doctor Nelson's office. (I'm not serious I'm glad I have good teeth!)   I will tell everyone I meet about the exceptional care I received. See you in March!!

I'm not a huge fan of hookah but my brother is, so last time he was visiting we stumbled onto this place.   The location was small and comfortable. The owner of the shop checked on us constantly and gave great recommendations.   The music was amazing. The owner explained all the different musical themed nights and I fell in love. It's a lovely place to relax and read and smoke.   Also, the bubbles are so fun! What a fantastic idea!   Sadly I dinged a whole star for lack of drinks. I think a soda fountain would be a fantastic investment. The cans of soda were expensive and I think I might have stayed longer and replenished my hookah a few more times had I not been so thirsty and not willing to pay another few bucks for a can of soda.  UPDATE: The fact that the owner of this hookah bar reached out to me, to explain to me WHY he doesn't serve fountain sodas completly earns the 5th star. But for someone who is a big drinker of liquids, I'd love buy 4 get the 5th free or something.   Does anyone know? Are outside food and drinks allowed?

Tellers here are great.  They don't bombard me with the usual sales pitches.  Personal bankers are awesome about account issues and super friendly.  I truly feel like they present solutions and not just sales.   This is my favorite branch.

The buffet at Talking Stick resort puts other buffets to shame.   The food is always fresh and of great quality. There's always an assortment of cheeses and meats.   Different international themes ranging from Asian to Mexican to Italian foods  The desert bar is exceptional boasting everything from gelato to various pies and cakes.   The service is always great- and like any true casino has Keno available.   We spend many special occasions at this buffet.

This is my regular nail place. They are close to work, and accommodating to walk ins. My biggest drawback is "can you wait 5 minutes" usually means no less than a half an hour, and they only have one young lady who does waxing. If she is in the middle of another service, you either wait, or she will leave someone hanging.   Another odd grievance is the fact they tell you they "can't" leave credit card tips, but in reality they can, and I have a few times. It's weird. I don't know if they don't want to report the tips, or they have expensive merchant services, but they should either offer it, or not.   They do wonderful gel nail service, and have a great color selection. The massage chairs for pedicures are also amazing. I continue to patronize this place because it is close to work, and I am no longer located close to Jenzia my favorite place in Tempe.

My girlfriend Carolyn want to go here as soon as she saw it on an episode of "Check Please"  I arrived a bit early, and was placed in a corner table, right up against the wall. The restaurant was a bit warm, but I think that was in part to being right up against what I thought was the kitchen.  I didn't order any libations, but the ones I saw being delivered across the restaurant looked delicious.   Carolyn and I ordered the Stuffed Dates as an appetizer, and they were amazing. Sweet, and bursting with flavor. For our main courses, Carolyn ordered Pork Tacos, and I got the bruschetta board. Carolyn asked specifically if the tacos were on corn tortillas due to her gluten sensitivity, and she was assured it was. However, the waitress did not think to mention the mean was breaded. Luckily She only has a sensitivity, and not an allergy. But that being said. my bruschetta board was absolutely amazing. I choose the Smoked Salmon, with capers and egg salad, The Red pepper Hummus, The Chicken Salad with Raspberry mayo and cranberries, and Brie, apples and apricot jam. Every single bit was better then the one before. Each one I tasted and though "I should have gotten 4 of this because there is no way the others can be as good...) Carolyn and I both cleaned our plates.   For desert, Carolyn ordered the Coconut Flan and a cappuccino , and I ordered The Santa Marta.  We spent the whole desert picking off of each others plates because they were both decedent.   We were also blown away and our bill, and how affordable the restaurant was... This restaurant packs so much flavor, for great prices.   The owner walked around, and visited each table which was very kind. The waitresses also had the most adorable aprons as their uniforms. I kept complimenting the waitress, and I'm sure she rolled her eyes because it's her work uniform,  but it was adorable.   I am already looking forward to taking my parents, and my husband to this amazing little Fountain Hills gem!   SUPPORT LOCAL RESTAURANTS!!

My husband and I love this buffet.  It is affordable and minus the salad, the food is always fresh.  (but come on, who comes to a chinese buffet for the salad LOL)   The sushi is always fresh, and doesn't taste too fishy.   The fried rice is amazing!   The wait staff is okay... it's a buffet, so it's easy for drinks to run dry.   Also, they're fortune cookies are actually GOOD. Usually they are stale, but they must go through a lot, because they are usually fresh.   All in all, we visit this place quite often, it's clean, consistent and always enjoyable.

Went here with several friends from out of town.  We happend to show up on a "fight night" - but sat on the other side of the resturant.  Had a party of five, and waited nearly20 minutes for a table.  (The hostess acted like our party of 5 was the biggest group she's ever heard of, and stated: We have to wait for another huge group to leave to give you there table")  we asked about sitting outside, but because one of our group was pregnant the woman stated "That is where the smokers sit, and I wouldn't feel comfortable seating her there.." which I thought was odd.   Once we were seated, our waitress was friendly but obviously very busy.  Forgot drink orders, multiple times, kept setting the rum and coke in front of the pregnant girl, and the regular coke in front of the drinker... which was odd (she did it twice?!) forgot about our desert (after 20 minutes we asked about it... and she ran to the kitchen... said it was burned, and would have to make another... but honestly I think she forgot)   Then the bill was wrong.   It was just one thing after another... I recognize they had a special event, and it was very busy - buf if you're going to have your staff working both a special event, and regular food service, you might want to consider hiring extra wait staff. There is NO reason they needed three hostesses...   I don't think we will be back to this location.

I love Taco Bell.  This location is beautiful. The interior reminds me of a local cantina vs the generic fast food feeling.   The food is consistent and the store is always clean. Even the art work is a little more hip that I'm used too.   The only gripe I have is the hours....  9am to 10pm lobby. The drive through an extra hour.   I feel like Taco Bell is known for fourth meal, which is in the middle of the night.   But I'm sure the staff doesn't mind not working overnight.

This is my favorite nail spot.  The actual store is beautiful and exceptionally clean.  Whoever designed it truly understood aesthetics.   I love their different pedicure options... The mocha smells amazing.  The stone massage is so relaxing.   They also do waxing and I have been so happy with my results.   Looking forward to getting a facial next week.

This is my favorite spot to get dinner.  And by dinner I mean pizza cookie.  Their pizza cookies are to die for! Slightly undercooked cookie dough in a deep dish personal pizza pan with vanilla ice cream and chocolate pieces.   This is the kind of desert dreams are made of.

My husband and I moved in to this complex in March of 13.   We were impressed by Audrey the property manager right away. She was very patient with us and seemed pretty willing to help us find a good fit for both our budget and our lifestyle.   The pools are fair. Nothing exceptional The hot tub is indoors which is different.  The gym is very small but the equipment is in good order There is a volleyball court and a tennis court which I've never used but I see people enjoying themselves.  There's also a small playground for the kiddies.   There is a small dog park at the back of the complex which my dogs adore.   The laundry rooms are seriously lacking. I feel like one or two of the machines are always down. Also the phone number for service is a dead end... I've lost more than a couple of bucks in the machines.   My husbands bike was stolen a few weeks ago but I think that's Tempe and not Suncadia fault.   Our 3 bedroom floor plan is amazing and even has a fireplace.   The best part when we moved in... The maids left a roll of toilet paper in each bathroom. Talk about making me feel home and loved the first day I moved in.   Potential renters in Tempe start and end your search here!

I respect the fact they want to give their employees Sundays off.  But seriously the only time I ever want to go to Hobby Lobby is on a Sunday.   Otherwise they have an amazing selection and their prices are more than acceptable. Great place for Christmas shopping too.   I'm great full for the Michaels in the same shopping center for my Sunday urges.

This was the first time my mother and I did something like this. My mothers coworker raved about the "reflexology foot massage" and mom and I thought we would give it a try...   We did not make an appointment, and they were able to accommodate us within 20 minutes which was awesome.   They have nice little lockers to store your things, and a little fridge with water if needed.   The room was large. It was a bit awkward, since there are multiple beds next to each other, and not even a curtain to separate you. I felt a little self conscious, but luckily I got over it quickly.   I had a great woman, though I did not ask her name, since silence was a big part of the experience. She had strong hands, and made me feel very relaxed.   Next time I will ask them not to do my face, because I broke out the next day, but I'm sure it's my sensitive skin, and not their fault.   They tried to make everything relaxing, and luxurious. Even a bowl full of scented flowers, under the table, when you moved to your back was a nice touch.   All in all, I plan on returning, and taking my husband. He could use a massage, better than the sad ones I try to give him!   The only reason I gigged them a star, is the waiting room wasn't very welcoming. The woman told us 20 minutes, so mom and I went to sit in the lobby and the girl goes "You can come back in 20 minutes..." almost like we shouldn't be waiting in the waiting room. There was a bunch of info about reflexology I kind of wanted to read. Instead we walked around sprouts LOL

I was so excited to write a review for this place.   Like I've mentioned in previous reviews, I'm a fan of the little guys.  Especially when it comes to BBQ.    I've had Dickies several times, mostly catered for corporate events, and I've always been less than impressed. It was never that is was BAD, it just wasn't great.   This particular location BLEW MY MIND!  I had a bad day at work, and wanted BBQ and this was close to home.  My husband and I split a family picnic with pulled pork, mac and cheese, and beans.  The pulled pork was the right amount of dry, with tasty little chunks of candied sauce.   The mac and cheese was wonderful, I could taste the cheddar. I didn't ask if they make it in house, or if there is another company but I LOVED it.  The Baked beans were okay, a little too spicy for my taste buds. My  husband and father LOVED the beans, said it reminded them of chili.  The manager told me it came from an outside company, so the beans technically aren't even theirs to rate LOL   Did I mention free ice cream? I didn't have any, but my mom made herself a rootbeer float and was happier than I had seen her in ages LOL  It's neat to see a resturant giving stuff away for free! My parents only got sodas, and didn't eat - so being offered free ice cream twice by the manager was awesome.   Spent quite a bit of time talking with Andrew, the General Manager - who told me, himself and the two owners are all culinary school graduates with backgrounds in fine dining.  They stated a majority of their rubs/sauces come for corporate - but they enforce clean kitchens, and 24 hours marinations.  I don't know what the differences is, but it's working.  Andrew, you run a great resturant. We will certainly be back.

I'm not pleased with this location.  My husband took me in about a month ago.  I had, what I thought, was just a devastating cold, but he was concerned and dragged me in.   The young lady at the desk, was tragically born without a personality. She was curt, short and borderline rude when asking me "why are you here" ...  I had a question about the paperwork, and you'd think I was asking her for her first born child. I've never been thrown so much shade by one person in my life. Sheesh.   Urgent Cares are notorious for their wait... I get it, but we waited over an hour before I was seen.  I was checked in by the Ms. No personality.   Once the PA came in, he was personable enough. He listened to my lungs, checked my ears, nose etc. You know, Doctor stuff... and he told me it was allergies. Recommended I get some over the counter medication, and tried to send me on my way. I explained, at one point my fever was so high, I was hallucinating... and allergies have never done that before, but he shrugged it off and insisted it was allergies.   I asked him for a flu test, because I was SURE this wasn't allergies. He did it. It was negative. So I believe him. I went home, took some Alergra D and went to bed.   The next day,  I was far worse, the "head congestion" was now deep in my chest, and I was worse than I was the day before. I ended up in the ER with walking pneumonia. The Doctor was beyond shocked that the PA recommended a decongestant, which forced the infection to STAY in my lungs, rather than be coughed up.   Thanks for nearly killing me FastMed, and charging me 175 dollars to boot.

Avoid this Fast Med Location like your life depends on it.  They not only put your health at risk, but your financial wellbeing as well.    I never received a bill from Fast Med, and assumed I met my deductible, and didn't give it a second thought. My fault, I should have called to ask why I wasn't billed.  Turns outs, instead of sending me a bill, they sent me straight to collections... for 200 dollars.    I'm furious.  There are no words to describe this, but  Not only did the lazy PA miss pneumonia diagnosis, but the "delightful" office staff I referenced earlier thought it would be easier to mess with my credit than properly bill me.   Thank you "Fast Med" for all the inconveniences you have caused my husband and I over the last year. You're a disgrace to all urgent care locations.

I can not say enough good things about this resturant.   My father took me here several weeks ago, for lunch one Saturday afternoon.  Now, my father loves trying small, locally owned resturants WITHOUT reading reviews on Yelp... so when he picks resturants I am always nervous.   However, I was completly blown away by this location.  I had the chili cheese burger, and the chili was the right amount of spice, and the sweet potato tots were to DIE for.   But the best, BEST part of this resturant, are the sauces.  (I had no idea what they call them... something-yokie?!)  But I was literally begging them to start selling the sauces to go, because the chipotle sauce of tasty goodness was so amazing. I dunked my tots, I smothered my burger.  It was so amazing.   Additionally, the waitress was bubbily, and fun, and very very attentive.   This is what a locally owned burger joint should be.   If I could give this resturant 10 stars I would.   SELL YOUR SAUCES by the bottle! I'd go broke trying them all :)

Visited again and again. Rehab Burger is my favorite.  Had the PB&J burger and as weird as it sounds... It is perfect. The sweet and savory complimented each other perfectly.   I also tried for pesto sauce for my tots and it was amazing. Another plea... Sell your sauces by the bottle! I'll be your number one customer.

It has taken me FAR too long to write this review.  I Clean Carpets saved my deposit from my last apartment.   My husband and I have two exceptionally well potty trained dogs, so deep carpet cleaning was never an issue. We made sure we had a good vacuum, and didn't spill our drinks.   But when one of our boys, Dak had a nasty bladder infection, followed immediately by bladder stones our carpet was screwed.  Poor boy was not even aware he was peeing most of the time, must less let us know he had to go outside.   I found Rob on Yelp... and he came with spectacular reviews so we gave him a shot.   I called Rob, and he answered while driving to another job. Told me he could call me back but it might be late. I told him no worries.   He called me back that night ( a little after 10pm) and we set an appointment.  I was so touched that he called, even after what sounded like an exceptionally busy day.   Sadly, I was not there to watch the master at work - since I myself had to work, but my husband was... and was blown away.   Rob got to work right away, and even took the time to send ME pictures of the different (and of the gunk he pulled out from the carpet!) He gave us a discount for paying him cash, AND for finding him on Yelp.   He also gave us some business cards to hand out, good for 10% off.   We got our full pet deposit back. They said the carpet looked great, and it was hard to tell we had two dogs.   Rob is amazing. He takes pride in his work, and it shows. Everyone who mentions getting their carpets cleaned gets a business card or at least a phone number from me.   When we move out of this place Rob, you know we're going to call you - even if the Boys haven't had any accidents yet, you never know.   10 Stars!

This place is a wonderful additional to the Scottsdale Pavillions.  Not only are they reservation prices cigarettes but the store is beautiful.  Very inviting. The Cigar bar smells delightful. There are comfortable chairs, televisions, and interesting conversation always happening.   But above all every single encounter with the staff has been exceptional. Very friendly people. Always reminding me about my free lighter with my carton. Even remember my brand.   My husband had started smoking a Pipe, and this place has a lovely assortment of loose tobacco, and pipe accessories. I picked up a great ash try/pipe stand for my husband for Christmas.   It's nice to purchase cigarettes without the snarky comment from the teenaged gas station clerk, or the disappointed mom behind you buying her kid funyons and mountain dews.   This is where intelligent smokers come to enjoy their cigars, and smokers can shop in peace. Thank you for being our One stop Shop my cigarette habit and my husbands pipe.

Previously Chasers, I spent many of my Friday and Saturday nights at this venue.   It's an odd venue, inside of a mostly empty strip mall. There is a small convenience store to the left, and a huge Jesus Christ book Store, oh and a pet shop. If someone opened a Filabertos or the like, I'm sure they'd make a killing after shows.   The entry process is interesting. If you're over 21 you can go through the front door, if you're under 21 you have to walk around the building, and go in the back way. I understand all ages show with a bar can be tricky, but there has to be a better way then sending kids to walk around a building, alone, in the dark!!  The drinks were reasonable, in fact so reasonable I may have over enjoyed myself, and still got out for just over 30 dollars.   Chasers used to have pool tables but they're gone now. Multiple high top tables with chairs in the "bar" areas.   They also have 3 big screen TVs with the live act on - so if you want to continue to drink, you can still watch the show (since it's near impossible to see the stage, because of a weird angle. That was a nice touch, otherwise I might have missed most of the show lol   They bar has obviously had a face lift since chasers, but it's just missing something. Also, I think they oversold the show that night, because I was shoulder to shoulder even in the bar area.   Depending on whose playing, we may go back. But it would have to be someone awesome.

This was such a fun experience.  I have never eaten at a resturant that utilizes a convayer belt instead of a waitress...  Apparently, this is a big thing in Los Angeles.. and I am just BEHIND the times.  My husband and I met a friend for dinner, and this was fantastic.  I loved  being able to plop down and start eating with waiting for anything but the perfect roll.   There is northing gormet about these rolls, there are philly rolls, Las Vegas Rolls, and other various tasty treats.  It's cheap, tasty, and above all, affordable.   The wait staff exsists to bring you drinks, and take orders for anything you don't see - however, it did take almost 15 minutes for someone to stop by and take a drink order.   I feel like a self serve soda fountain (cups delivered on a plate?) might be in order...   Can not WAIT to visit this again - and it's so close to work, it might be my new lunch place!

I am a big fan of hot dogs, enough my husband teases me about it. So naturally, when I heard Portillo's was coming to Scottsdale I was excited.   It was strange to me, to see a Resturant MONTHS after opening, with drive through lines across the parking lot, and a VERY VERY full dining room.   We got in line, and I had no idea what I wanted, and didn't have much time to pick because someone with a bag and a pencil pressures you into ordering before you even get to a register. I understand they are trying to speed things up, but when I'm a first timer --- let me look at the menu.   I ended up ordering a Chili Dog.   It was great to have glass between us, and the kitchen. It was exciting to watch everything going on and MAN do they have a LOT of employees. Everything seemed to work like clock work.   I have also decieded my new dream job is to be the girl who calls out the order number!  Number Eight Seven, you're about to be in HEAVEN!  Very clever!   The food was delightful.  I really enjoyed my chili dog, and the french friends were hot and tasty.    I will be returning - but don't rush me!

For the DMV my experience wasn't too bad.  The wait wasn't very long (approx 1 hour) and everyone I encountered was friendly and helpful. I was just changing my last name on my car title. Four dollars later, I walked out with my new title, no problem.  Sure, I'd rather wait LESS time but when you're expecting it... it isn't too bad.   Does.... smell a bit in there. Can't put my finger on what it is... But I'm sure it's just an old building or something.

Since my husband and I moved across town, this is my new QT.  It's different than some of the ones I'm used too! It has two entrances, and the coffee and Teas are across the store from the soda fountains (weird?!)   But they have the fresh food "Kitchen" and quality I've come to expect from QuickTrips.  They're always clean, always well lit, and always fresh.   The staff is a bit less friendly than my old location (19th Ave and Deer Valley) on more than on occasion I've been stuck in line while the gentleman at the register flirted with the girl in front of me (usually on late night runs) and there is one young lady who works in the morning who looks like she'd rather be anywhere else in the world. I get it, it's your job, you aren't always going to love it, but you're in customer service. Don't make me feel like I've ruined your day by showing up.   I'm going to continue to visit, since it's next door... and maybe you'll earn your 5th Star. If anyone can, it's QT

This is a wonderful place to get your alignment done on your vehicle. Gary is very old school in his shop. The whole shop has a certain "golden era" shine to it. There are hot rods in various states of paint and repair all around the shop.   Gary is very professional, and carries a towel with him so he doesn't get grease on your car. His prices are UNBEATABLE.   He employs his granddaughter who kept herself busy the whole time she was there. Tidying up. Taking phone calls. Making conversation with patrons.   I'm a big fan of the family owned and operated, and Gary is no exception! Thank you for the spectacular alignment job on my car!  One thing to remember, Gary only takes CASH or CHECKS. VERY old school :)

Two weeks ago, I did something to my back while in Yoga. After hobbling around for a week I made an appointment at the joint. Bonnie at the front desk was very kind, and accommodating. Your first appointment is only 19 dollars.   When I showed up, Doctor Smith took me back right away. He started our conversation by bringing out a model of the spine, and showing me the things he was talking about, and how everything comes back to the spin.   My first adjustment wasn't as awkward as I imagined it would be, in fact there was 2 instances of instant relief.    Dr. Smith was very precise, and explained everything he was doing, as he did it, and I felt very safe.    My second visit was just as great (though no moment of instant relief) I look forward to finishing my treatment with Dr. Smith, and the rest of the office at The Joint Noterra.

My father and I visited for lunch on a Sunday hoping to watch the baseball game and grab some lunch.   We were told to seat ourselves in the bar area and it took almost 15 minutes for our waiter to notice us. He explained that there were people in white who would being us free samples.   I was feeling light so I ordered the Chicken chopped salad. My father ordered the Streak Burger.   My father really enjoyed his burger. He had the parm/garlic sauce.   The chicken chopped salad was fresh but the chicken was cold. The sauce does not translate well when served cold instead I warm. The manager said that is the way they serve it now. She said next time I can order it warmed up or even crispy. We will see.   Usually great service can redeem any poor kitchen output. This was not the case with our waiter.  He was polite and all but seemed distracted or too busy to fuss Ruth has. Has to seek other servers for refills and it took him quite a bit of time to get us our bill.   That being said... When the bill arrived Bell the manager grabbed our bill and exchanged it. She comped my salad and next time she wants me to try it with crispy chicken.     I was planning on a 2 star rating but comping and entire dish is exceptional.   Manager Bell, not only have you earned a nice review but I will give your restaurant another shot but maybe with crispy chicken this time

I really love this Gym.   I've been battling my weight most of my life, and I've never had good luck keeping a fitness routine.  However, something about Planet Fitness has helped me keep my fitness goals.  Sure, their personal trainers have been running through a revolving door, and most of them are promoted desk jockeys, but I don't really use their service or take their "classes"  The have TONS of cardio equipment, and just enough weights that there is no, or very little wait. People are polite, and the facility is CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN.   I was visiting some other gyms because I was interested in classes, but nothing came close to Planet Fitness. I've been visiting nearly daily for eight months and I love it.  This is my home Gym, and I will continue to visit as long as I can!   Thank you Planet Fitness for creating the environment I need to get healthy!

Went to the grand opening. There was a balloon artist and some five sways. I didn't experience either but the building and interior both, are beautiful.   The staff are friendly but it's obvious they are new at the fast food game.   I'm excited that this McDonalds opened. It's so close to home and its my new morning drink shop.   Only had breakfast so far... Gonna stop in for dinner soon.

The only reason I gave this two stars... Is the fact it is open all night.  My husband and I arrived in Las Vegas much later than we intended (due to a dead battery!) so by the time we checked into Circus Circus we were famished.   We were under the assumption Las Vegas was one of those 24/7 kind of towns and were shocked at how much was closed.   We found the Pizzaria and were so relieved SOMETHING was open. The pleasure stops there.   We ordered a 10 inch pesto pizza and it was awful. First off, the only thing pesto about it was the fact there were full pine nuts on it. Otherwise all I tasted was garlic. Everything garlic. Now I love garlic but not when it's the only flavor.  The crust wasn't too bad and tasted reasonably fresh (no frozen) but the toppings were a disaster. Take it from me, if its late... Find a McDonald's. This location was a disappointment.

This is my favorite lunch spot by work.  You can load up your salad or pizza with every single topping, and no one bats an eyes. They offer "pre selection" menu options, or you can customize. They also have limited bottled beer, and Bellinis.   They keep the ovens at near 500 degrees, so your food cooks VERY fast. I've yet to have a pizza undercooked, or burnt. They have it down to a science.   The staff is friendly, and remembers me, and makes recommendations to "spice up" my usual, and they are always right.   They are VERY busy during the lunch time, which is great for them, but apparently I've told too many people about my secret lunch spot.   The ONLY downside, is any way you slice it - it's fast food pizza. It's never going to compare with New York pie.   I will certainly be back :)

I'm skewing the perfect record but I'm sorry. I haven't been this disappointed in a dining experience in a very long time. My family and I sat for almost 10 minutes while we waited for our meal. The waiter finally stopped by, asked if we had ordered any drinks, but realized we didn't have menus, and left without taking any drink orders. 10 minutes later he's back with menus. Still no drink orders. 15 or so minutes later he finally takes our drink order. So needless to say, the service was poor. When we  finally did order, we were famished.   My husband had their signature burger which he described as forgettable.  My father had a grilled cheese with mushrooms, and Chicken Chili. He loved the chili describing it as "filling and hearty"   My mother had the fish fry and she loved it.  I had the chicken and dumplings and I was quite disappointed. It lacked depth, and flavor. My husband took a bite and said the Military MREs has more flavor.   The service was poor, the table of drunk girls got unwavering attention. So perhaps, they cater to a drinking crowd.   Best part of the evening? Watching a Scottsdale mom pull an Olive out of her martini and feed it to her infant. DRUNK BABY ALERT lol   My take away, come for the booze. Ignore the "gourmet" menu.

Finally I have found my Doctor!  Once again, I used trust Yelp to find an OB/GYN office that delivered at Honor Health Shea and I found Valley OB/GYN Associates.   Doctor Nancy McCauley, is their newest doctor, and a D.O. to boot. Oh meeting her was wonderful. She treated me like an old friend. She was very conscious about ensuring we didn't run the same tests as the last office, so I wouldn't get double billed, and was very patient with my endless number of questions. She has a very calm demeanor, but is also very honest and upfront.   My second appointment was for my ultrasound, which was a dream experience. My husband was there, and we got to watch our tiny gummy bear on a flat screen TV right in front of us. The woman was very kind and very patient and made us very comfortable.   I immediately had a follow up appointment with Dr. McCauley who assured me everything looked great, and again listened to both mine and my husband's concerns. We scheduled another appointment for the dreaded glucose test.   The best part, one day later, Doctor McCauley called me HERSELF to mention some of my medication I should stop taking prior to the test, and to reschedule prior to the glucose test. Talk about making me feel like a valued patient.   TEN STARS for Dr. McCauley.

I went to Top Golf convinced I was NOT going to enjoy myself.  I do not care for golf. Not even mini-golf, but my work was going for "team building" and I showed up.   The cost isn't bad - 35 for a bay, and 5 dollars a person for a card. I personally didn't golf, but the rest of my team did. They all raved about the different games you could play with the "micro chipped" balls.   The food was wonderful, the drinks were plentiful. Originally, we were in a bay where the fan was broken, so they moved us, and it was MUCH cooler.   The only gripe, is a coworker of mine ordered a burger, and asked for guac - the food runner was convinced the order was "not right" (though it looked right!) because of the guac - and the poor girl had to wait an extra 20 minutes while they "found" her food. They insist this made a new once since they "lost" it - but she was convinced, they brought her the original one. Food runners can be a necessity, but make sure they know people CAN custom order extra toppings.

My father has been hospitalized far too many times in the last year and we have come to know this hospital well.   The doctors are good. The nurses are attentive and its always clean.   The reason I give this review 4 Stars rather than 5 since my father has received exceptional care is the fact his last hospitalization; the nurses would promise him he was getting discharged that night only to have the Doctor keep him another night. This happened 3 nights in a row.   The nurses should not make those statements if they aren't sure. Three nights in a row I rearranged my schedule to drive him home only to be disappointed again.   No one likes being in a hospital. And it's worse if you think you're getting out a s forced to stay another night.   That being said, Scottsdale Health Care is our ER of choice. Each department we've had experience with has been amazing.

This place was a long awaited revival of an Arizona staple.   The original Minder Binders was an awesome Barn shaped building, with peanuts on the floor, and random brick-a-brack all over. The Mission @ Minder Binders basically pulled the kitchen OUT of the center of the bar, and moved it to a separate building, but left a majority of the fun intact. There is still the moose with the cigarette, still Bush Senior in a wedding dress, and lots and lots of beer signs.   The menu is significantly smaller than expected - mostly burgers and salads. There are also a few chicken dishes.   The cocktail menu is decent, but not consistent. My father ordered a class "Harvey Wallbanger" and it was awful. We actually googled the recipe on our phone to show to waiter. He was rather offended he sent the drink back, and continued to ask "what we didn't like about it..." and we explained several times over that it wasn't a Harvey Wallbanger.   That aside, this place is so stitched with nostalgia and fond memories, we will be back. Hope to see you there.
