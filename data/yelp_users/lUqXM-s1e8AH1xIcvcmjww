I went to Presto Nails because it was nearby and I wanted to try a new nail salon (and needed a pedicure *badly*).  The manager, Tom, was very nice as was the whole staff. One thing that stood out was the fact that they greeted their repeat clients by name, and that those clients returned that courtesy. I find that a nice touch, made them very personable. Services offered are manicures, pedicures and facial waxing, from what I saw and talked about. I got a mani and a pedi.  Anyway: The staff will make suggestions on services but did not seem put off when I declined. They didn't try to go for the hard sell, which I liked a lot. The manicure and pedicure were standard pricing, but their massages here are longer than most other places I've been too. Also, my tech was really thorough when doing the callous removal.  The place is clean, the staff is nice, and you really do leave feeling relaxed. I will definitely make return visits. And will be trying out their brow waxing. Saw a lady who had just gotten hers done and they looked nice.

Lots of nail polish selection. They have some older collections for OPI, China Glaze, and Color Club and had plenty of stock on current collections. The prices are very good for brand names, and they have discounts if you're a beautician.  They sell a variety of other beauty products as well, like false lashes, but are mainly a nail product supply.  Like the place and I'll definitely head back when I need more nail polish!

I stopped by due to picking a lunch place at random. It was a small trek for me to get to, but was worth it.  For $6, I got a hefty half-sandwich and cup of fruit. I find that to be a good deal! The turkey sandwich I got had plenty of meat on it, and the bread wasn't so thick as to be a meal unto itself. And the cup of fruit was a big cup (I'd guess a 12oz drink cup) filled with fruit.  I recommend this place! Eating there is a bit cramped inside, and a couple tables were outside, but picking up to go works just fine as the food was tasty and plentiful.

The food here is awesome, but definitely be prepared for the host to be kind of gruff with you. However, he wasn't pushy about the specials.  As suggested, the hummus with meat and pine is hummus with beef and pine nuts and was a great appetizer.  We tried both the lentil and the tomato soup. The lentil was good, but the tomato was creamy, had basil and was my favorite of the two. We also tried the falafel as well as the gyros plate. Both were very good and very reasonably priced. Byblos is definitely getting added to the restaurant rotation.

Very sadly, this store is actually closed now. They were great, always clean, the staff was always helpful. But, the company decided to close up the stores.

Based on the reviews here and a couple other places, I decided to hit up HTC for a nose and a tongue piercing. I was pierced by JD. He was super professional, had a great sense of humor and talked me through everything he was doing and all aftercare. He was also patient when I wasn't quite getting where my tongue needed to be when he was doing the tongue markings and piercings. Also, he does "freehand" for the tongue, so no clamps, just FYI.  The place was very clean and all equipment was sterile. JD changed his gloves at least 4 times during the process. When a ball for the tongue bar fell, he was sure to go and get a new one.  I definitely recommend HTC. Their pricing is on par with most other places, they have a really good jewelry selection and don't do a hard-push up-sell for higher-priced jewelry.   Also, as a note to those thinking of going to a shop for stretching piercings, HTC will use glass for stretching, which is great for people with metal allergies.

The nail polish selection isn't that great for non-gel, but they do have a ton of gel colors. Otherwise, selection isn't great and it's difficult to find other items as most of them are boxed up.  I didn't have any problems with the service, but I also wasn't browsing there for very long because of how little there was.
