Shuttle to the PHX airport every 30 min starting at 5am.  Room Service Menu is 24/7 and pretty good. kids menu as well. Free wifi in lobby, which u can probably reach in your room.

I missed the Lobster and Steak Day. It moved from Monday MNF to Thursdays. Its Kinda a cool spot to watch MNF. Staff are nice. Food honestly is really good. The Dj Wouldn't play Digital Undergrounds "Freaks Of the Industry," said it was to slow for time. Free Parking.

Nice Staff. Food On premises is good. Decor and stylistically not out of date. Elevator ride on North Shafts is more lively then looking at a metal wall. TVs in Room R Large.

The new wing seems like it should be designed better from a Transportation Engineering and Logical point of View. makes me wonder if they had a lack of space to work with.

This airport in Phoenix is relatively drama free. Small easy to navigate. Staff were nice

Was a great Restaurant centrally located near all of downtown PHX major facilities; sports arena's, hotels, CBD, courthouse's and sheriffs station etc.  The waiter was really nice and informative. The gumbo was good.

Was one of the few places opened late on a Monday Night. Found through yelp actually, and was glad I did baby. Full bar. Pho. Shared bathroom concept was in effect with an organic twist. The place seemed like all my cool hip freak-a-zoids be at. Food was pretty good baby.

The WAll of Speakers is pretty fresh.  All the Girls who work there, look like they do at least 4 days of workouts on their stomachs. It has an open air atmosphere.
