Tranquility and a place to collect your thoughts.    St.Mary's Basilica is a classic Roman Catholic church and is a wonderful  place to visit if you're in the  downtown Phoenix area.  The stained glass,statutes, pipe organ, and high cathedral ceilings are spectacular.  You have to see the stained glass to truly appreciate its beauty. The combination of stained glass and masonry construction will bring you back to another era.  It reminds me of being back East and the time I spent traveling abroad .   The outside of St. Mary's Basilica is as beautiful as the inside. The garden is a picturess place to take a causal walk. The garden is  shaded for those hot summer days, filled with varuous plants, trees,  with a magnificent water fountain in the middle.  If your in the downtown Phoenix area and have some time stop by and enjoy the rich historic beauty of the Basilica.

Not  Bad   I pass by Chico's Tacos daily but seldom stop in. Today, I was in a bit of a rush and decided to stop in for a quick bite to eat. I was pleasantly surprised at the large menu Chico's offered.  You place your order at the counter and your number is called when your order is ready bring. The service is good, the restaurant is clean,  and the atmosphere is pleasant.  Chico's offers a "salsa bar" where you can indulge yourself with various types of salsas, chopped onions, chopped tomatoes with onions, peppers, and cilantro. On this visit I choose the grilled chicken and steak tacos.  I really enjoy with the grilled steak taco.  The steak was flavorful, tender, and season well. However,  I  did not care for the chicken taco.  The chicken was somewhat dry and lacked flavor.  Chico's offers a clean environment, good service, and inexpensive entrée's. Depending on what you order the food can be from average to not so good.

Excellent customer service and very friendly staff  I started going to Los Olivos after I started working in downtown Phoenix. While I definitely agree that Los Olivos  takes longer than other car washes I've visited, however, Los Olivos is definitely worth the wait.    Los Olivos is committed to giving the customer what they want, a great car wash at a reasonable price. Los Olivos is committed to making each customer happy and satified. Give Los Olivos a try you won't be disappointed.

NFL Experience ... what a great event   Recently, I spent a great amount of time at the Phoenix Convention Center while attending the  The NFL Experience.  I have to give credit to the City of Phoenix and all their participating downtown partners for making the NFL Experience such an amazing event. Literally, downtown Phoenix was transformed into a  pro football's interactive theme park.    Inside the convention center were games for adults and children, displays, membrellium, youth football clinics, and free autograph sessions with current and former NFL players. Outside the convention center was equally entertaining with, concerts, food vendors, rock climbing wall, and nightly fireworks displays.  I had never spent a lot of time at the Phoenix Convention Center and failed to realize all that the convention center has to offer. The center is in walking distance of major hotels, shopping, major sports events. Thetheatre venues, even have their own dedicated stop on the Metro Light Rail line, it doesn't get much beer then that.    If your in the area of the convention center you should stop by and spend some time.

Cooperstown Sports Grill Does NOT disappoint!   Cooperstown offers an incredible selection of beers, good food and excellent service.  The prices are reasonable, and the servers are outstanding.    Cooperstown Sports Grill is big, filled with large screens televisions. The walls are covered in vintage guitars signed by every rock star and rare sports collectibles signed by past & present icons.   The food entrees have celebrity names, like the Bill O'reilly BBQ sandwiches, Kurt Warner corned beef,  AZ Cardinals Country BBQ chicken salad, or my favorite the "Jeff"  grilled chicken salad.  I would put the grilled chicken salad up against anybody (including Durant's or even Arrogant Butcher).  So if you find yourself in downtown Phoenix give Cooperstown Sports Grill a try, it does not disappoint

Ringling Brothers & Barnum Bailey Circus  There's a reason it's called "The Greatest Show On Earth" and that's because in all of my years of Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey circus going, The Greatest Show on Earth still usually manages to deliver something I've not seen before.  My nephew and I really enjoyed the show, especially the master of ceremonies high jinks. The performers were very interactive with crowd, which made for a great show for all.  This years show featured a dog show where dogs jumped through hoops and bars, acrobatics/gymnastics, elephants, and all the acts were amazing. The highlight for me was the elephant show; it is unbelievable how smart those animals are.  I can't write about the circus and not mention the big-cat act, which comes with no less then 12 big cats. It's impossible to imagine what it must feel like to be in a cage with a dozen Bengal tiger's. Ringling Brothers certainly tames more tigers than I've ever seen at one time.  There wasn't a  dull moment and the best part  we had great seats that were quite affordable at $25 per person.

The Arizona Science Center has interactive learning exhibits  for every age.   I've been to the Arizona Science Center on  many occasions and my visits have always been a great experience. The facility itself is impressive, a very nice building with lots of interesting features that you can enjoy for the price of general admission.   Before you visit, Arizona Science Center you should  find out what the featured exhibits are.  The featured exhibits  cost extra, but are well worth the money. We saw their special exhibit- Lost Egypt which had alot of hands on activities.  However, my favorite exhibit was the Forces of Nature.  This exhibit allows kids to understand Earth as a dynamic planet.  You will shake to an earthquake,  feel the strength of hurricane winds, the heat of fire and the eruption of a volcano,  it's great.  There is also a bicycle over the main hallways on a cable that you could pedal, a water area outside, and the planetarium, should not be missed.  There is also a  IMAX theatre in 3D with great features.  After a long day you can head to the  cafeteria which offers healthy menu items, and is not as expensive as other museum cafes.  If you have a museum membership elsewhere, Arizona Science Center will honor it.    While at the science center you will encounter friendly's staff throughout the building.  The staff is willing and eager to assist  patrons learn and enjoy the exhibits. There are so many hands-on things to see and do, it's impossible to do everything on one visit. If you have time you should stop by and see for yourself.

Mexican Food Done Right   My co-worker and I decided we wanted authentic Mexican food for lunch and after reading reviews for Rosita's we headed down to 24th Street and McDowell for lunch.  Rosita's isn't one of those typical  fancy chain "Mexican Gourmet" restaurants.  Rosita's is the real deal and the folks at Rosita's are doing "Mexican Food" up right.  As we entered the restaurant we sat ourselves at a table.  Our server took our drink order and brought us a huge basket  of chips and salsa.  The chips at Rosita's are made fresh to order and served sizzling hot. These chips are thin, crispy, lightly salted, and absolutely delicious. I could have easily ate the entire basket but needed to save room for our lunch entrée's.   Usually when I dine at a Mexican Restaurant  I order a machaca burrito enchilada style, so there is no telling how many machaca burritos enchilada style  I've earen over the years. So, today was no diffrent. I had the machaca beef burrito enchilada style and it was delicious. One of the best machaca burritos I've even eaten.  The machaca was moist, tender, and full of flavor.   My tastebuds were in heaven. Not only was my burrito delicious,  the serving was large, and I mean very large.  I couldn't even finish half my burrito.    Everything we tried was unbelievably tasty. From the  machaca burrito, chicken mole, green chili tamale, to the guacamole & beans each dish was absolutely delicious.  If your ever in the area, stop by Rosita's you will not be disappointed.

A Salvadorian Gem  Guanaquito  is a family-owned restaurant tucked in an unassuming building on the North side of McDowell Road in Phoenix.  Guanaquito is an affordable  restaurant that serves traditional Salvadorean cuisine. I would recommend the papusas, stuffed cheese, beans, and pork.  the Papusas are accompanied by a pickled cabbage mixture called curtido and salsa roja, a thin and flavorful tomato sauce. Our entrees were flavorful, prepared perfectly, and plated nicely.  If you want to be adventurous and try something a little different I would recommend the fried yucca root flower relleno, it's flavorful and absolutely delicious.   Lunch for two for under 20 bucks. It doesn't get any better.  If your in the area give Guanaquito a try.

UK pub atmosphere in Phoenix  I have never been to a pub in the UK.  Howerver, I have a image in my mind of what a pub in the UK might look like and George and Dragon made that image a reality.  George and Dragon is unpolished, and unpretentious.  The atmosphere is very relaxing and welcoming.  As I  sat muling over the menu I enjoyed listening to the random music being played.  In the short time I was at George and Dragon I  listened to  metal, George Michael, Aretha Franklin, classical and everything in between.   The customer service at George and Dragon in amazing.  The servers  were very accommodating without being intrusive. Our server took the time to explain the menu and even offered suggestions based on our preferences.  Moving onto the food.  The food at George and Dragon is great and served piping hot (which I truly enjoy).  The unique combinations of flavors were prepared and presented perfectly.  My lunch party and I tried Bangers & Mash, Roasted Vegetable Pastie, fish& chip, Shepherd Pie, and Meatloaf. All of the entrées were delicious.   Even though we were full from lunch because at George and Dragon the servings are large. We had to try dessert. So we ordered blackberry crumble and  bread pudding.  I have to say the bread pudding  was the best I have ever had.  We will definitely be making this place a regular stop.

Just Not For Me  The staff at Juan's Authentic Mexican Food is warm, friendly, and extremely accommodating, which is why I feel terrible for calling out their Mexican food as bland. I really wanted to like Juan's so badly, especially after reading so many positive reviews. However, the food in my opinion just isn't good.  This was my second visit to Juan's Authentic Mexican Food Restaurant, and for me the food is just so-so. Just one step above what you would be served in a fast food establishment.  I enjoy starting my meal with chips and salsa just like everyobe else.  The salsa at Juans is like a watery tomato puree posing as salsa and the chips tasted stale. For my entrée I choose the Beef Flatas and Mexican rice, both of which had very little taste.  The meal was just very disappointing and took over 30 minutes to serve.  Juan's isn't the worst but I'm not in a rush to visit again

The redwood looking cottage   I have worked in the downtown Phoenix Area for a long time and have driven by Schreiners numerous times but never stopped in, what a mistake on my part..   However, one day my curiosity got the best of me,   My co-worker and I decided to give Schreiners a try for lunch. I went with the brown bag lunch special for just a mere $5.  The brown bag lunch includes a selection of sausage choices, a variety of condiments, bag of chips and a can of soda. I went with the New York Dog and even tho Schreiners offers a wide variety of condiments I kept it simple and went with mustard only.  I was not disappointed. The New York dog was fresh, delicious, and did I mention locally made.   Schreiners offers sausage and other meats by the pound.. In addition to, potato salad,  macaroni salad,, breads, pierogi's with a number of fillings, and chorizo made daily in the store.  On my way out I picked up a pound of chorizo to go.   All I have to say about the chorizo is that Schreiners sells the freshest and best tasting chorizo around. Once you have Schreiners chorizo you will stop buying chorizo from anywhere else. Most store purchased  chorizo comes out greasy and oily but Schreiners does not.  Schreiners chorizo is full of flavor minus the grease and for less then $5.00 a pound  you get your moneys worth.   Hands down this is the  best chorizo around.   If you haven't stopped by Schreiners you're missing out.

Even the name fails to covey what lies inside.  Pizza Heaven is the type of place you could drive by and never even notice however, that would be a mistake because Pizza Heaven Bistro  is a great place to grab Italian food at a reasonable  price.  I have been to Pizza Heaven a few times and have never been disappointed. The menu includes a wide variety of pizzas along with a tasty selection of pasta entrée's.  Pizza Heaven Bistro is fairly small however, they have a robust take out business as well as a very busy dine in traffic.  The food and the service are always good. The atmosphere  feels a bit like home. What more could you asked for.  Good food,  good service,  great prices.

Something For Everyone  I enjoy shopping and I am always looking for unique pieces to decorate my home.  I have to admit, Cost Plus World Market is one of the best  specialty stores, that has a large selection of  products imported from around the world.  I wish there was a Cost Plus Market that was located closer to home because  I would have to  make weekly visits.  On this visit I was looking for Ivory Dinnerware Set as a gift for a friend. I was pleasantly surprised that Cost Plus Market had such a large selection of dinnerware  to choose from and at very competitive prices. I selected a set of Provence dinner plates that were absolutely elegant and classic.  I even purchased a second set for myself.   I can never leave Cost Plus Market without stopping by the Wine, Beer, & Spirits and the International Food Section. Foods from all over the world.  Cost Plus has a  better  selection then AJ's.  Cost Plus is clean, organized, and well stocked.  The staff is friendly and acomadating and you can always find various sales. If you have never been to Cost Plus Market, you should make a point to stop by and take a look around.

Always A Great Meal.  I have been to Lone Star Steakhouse on Camelback on several occasions and have never been disappointed.  Lone Star Steakhouse's has a casual and inviting atmosphere and is known for their outstanding customer service  and memorable meals.  Lone Star Steakhouse has so many delicious entrées to select from.  There are  steaks which are delicious and reasonably priced. The burgers are large and cooked to perfection and the ribs will melt in your mouth. If beef isnt for you, then you have to select a chicken entrée.  The sidewinder chicken sandwich is always  an excellent choice whether served as a sandwich or as an entree.     The entrees are well worth the price, at under $15 (depending on the entree).  The service is excellent and the staff is friendly and accomdating.  The manager's makes themselves  avaliable to their guest, as they walk around the dining area ensuring their guest are having a pleasant  dining experience.  If you find yourself in the area give Lone Star Steakhouse a try, you won't be disappointed.

A Great Pie At A Great Price!  On every visit to NYPD I am seated promptly, and the service is always outstanding. There has never been a time where I had to wait for anything.  The staff is very accommodating.   As a native from NYC I can be pretty picky when it comes to my pizza. I really enjoy a good slice of NY style pizza folded in half loaded with toppings and NYPD never fails me.   NYPD serves up an authentic pie with just the right amount of seasonings, a tasty blend of oregano and basil. Topped with a  fabulous sauce and NYPD  never scrimps on the toppings. Their pizza's are loaded. Not to mention, as an extra bonus, a NYPD pizza holds up as a great leftover, even when reheated unlike many other pizzas west of the city.  I have never been disappointed in an NYPD Pizza and will always go back for a slice or two!

The place to go for all your battery needs.  I always go to Batteries Plus bulbs anytime I need a light fixture or battery.  You can't beat the technical expertise and customer service that receive at Batteries Plus Bulbs.   I have to admit there is a comfort in knowing that anytime I have a question the folks at Batteries Plus will have the answer.   The staff at Batteries Plus are friendly, helpful,  and knowledgeable.  I highly recommend Batteries Plus Bulbs anytime you need a battery or bulb.

Delicious Food, Wonderful Service    I recently went to Desert Jade for lunch and was welcomed with a friendly smile when I walked in the restaurant. I was seated almost immediately and greeted by my server with water and a smile.   Everything was tasty and plentiful. The Mongolian beef was particularly good.  The Mongolian beef is delicately sliced, very lean, flavorful, and melts in your mouth. My fellow "yelpers" this is Mongolian beef perfection. I couldn't find a single flaw, I just couldn't and now my mouth is watering.  Desert Jade has very affordable prices and the portions are great.  The staff is incredibly nice, friendly, gracious and accommodating and the service is second to none. In addition, Desert Jade offers terrific lunch and dinner specials.   Overall I was really happy with the quality, quantity, and the service that was given to me!

Wish I was able to give  1/2 of a Star!   I don't know why the Yelper in me failed to check  out Golden Coin prior to giving it a shot.  However, I craved an all you can eat Chinese Buffet and went to Golden Coin because it was close to work. Probably the worst Chinese buffet I have ever been to, I take that back  "No Probably" about it, Golden Coin is the worst Chinese Buffet I have ever been to!                                       Eight Items on the Buffet   Fried Wontons, Rice, Lo Mien, Vegetables, Chicken, Chicken Wings, Egg Rolls, & Sweet and Sour pork   As I took my first bite of rice a single thought ran through my head: "How can a Chinese Restaurant not cook rice right"?  If the rice wasn't bad enough the Lo Mien sure was, not sure how to describe that taste, but it's not Lo Mien, so I will stick with tasteless soggy noddles. The eggrolls were equally bad, small, cut in half, and horrible and once again a taste that is hard to describe, so lets go with tasteless again, after all it worked when describing the Lo Mien. Moving on to the sweet and sour pork, this dish consisted of  small,dried out,  hard pieces of what  I am assuming was pork covered in a reddish sauce that had the consistency of water.  Tasteless doesn't begin to describe that dish! The Wontons can best be described as greasy crispy noddles and don't even get me started on the chicken and wings. How in the world does Golden Coin prepare that stuff? It's awful.   So there yo have it, that's it. The entire Golden Coin Buffet. Don't think you can wash down a bad meal with soda....no refills on the sodas at Golden Coin!!!!

A co-worker and I were craving a burger for lunch, so we decided to head over to "The Chicago Hamburger Co" to satisfy our craving. I was impressed with the inside of the restaurant which had Chicago memorabilia everywhere.  On this visit  I ordered the cheddar burger and french fries lunch special.  I didn't realize  how big the burgers at Chicago Hamburger Co were. The burger was flavourful, the bun was toasted perfectly,  and the condiments were delicious.  To be honest,  everything was cooked perfectly especially the fries, which were fresh, crispy, and serve piping hot. I also decided to try a few mild wings since I am  a sucker for wings.  I was pleased with the wings,  the meat just came right off the bone.  If you're ever in the area and in the mood for a great burger, at a reasonable price,  from a restaurant that has great customer service,  you should stop by.

Just wasn't good  I really hate to write a negative review about a restaurant that receives so many positive comments but the food at Bamboo House just wasn't good. With that being said let's start off on a positive note.  If you go to Bamboo House , you will receive good customers service.   Now time to move onto the meal.  My meal got off to a bad start with the egg-drop soup, which consisted of a tasteless, watery liquid in which floated, hard peas, tofu, and thick strands of eggs.  Moving onto the entrees, the Mongolian Beef was tough and chewy, the chicken chow mein dish was likewise an exercise for one's jaw. The rice, eggrolls, and fried wontons were equally disappointing.  In all honesty, I would be hard-pressed to think of a place with worse Chinese food.

Gas and so much more.  QuikTrip is always a great choice when it comes to refueling.  I find it a challenge to just purchase "gas" when I visit a QuikTrip.  I like the soda fountain station, and the  multitude of snacks QuikTrip has to offer. I always manage to find a snack I hadn't had in quite some time, and it just calls my name.   Reasonably priced gas, ice cold drinks, and snacks, it doesn't  get any better.

Not Bad.....Not Bad At All  I was expecting Mi Pueblo Mexican Food to be the typical Mexican fast food. Boy was I wrong.  Mi Pueblo is a step above the rest.  Lets start with the complimentary hot chips and salsa. Many Mex style recipes give you those cheap paper thin tasteless chips but not Mi Pueblo. These chips are lighy, crispy, and flavorful and  salsas are really tasty.  On this visit I ordered the grilled chicken taco plate and I  not  disappointed. The chicken was moist, seasoned, and loaded with flavor. The chicken tacos came with a homemade "dressing" not sure what it was. All I know it was really good.  Even though I was completely full from.my meal I couldn't leave without trying dessert.  So I decided to try the  sopapillas which come drizzled with honey and powdered sugar and a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side, it was delicious.  Good food, inexpensive meals, and great customer.  I will be back.

You threw my sandwich away... my sandwich.... MY SANDWICH!   My friends always tease me when we are searching for a good sandwich shop.  I have been told on more then one occassion that I can be little "Ross" or "Joey"  like from the show  "Friends" when it comes to my sandwiches.   Today, we went to Breadcrafters Bakery and Cafe for lunch, and it was absolutely delicious. I've had many sandwiches from all over the valley and the folks at Breadcrafters Bakery and Cafe are doing up sandwiches right. Lookout,  AJ's Whole Foods, Jimmy Johns, Quiznos, Capriottis, and all the others; Breadcrafters Bakery and Cafe is here.  Breadcrafters offers great lunch specials.  You can get a sandwich and your choice of potato salad, pasta salad, fruit salad,  or chips.  Today, my lunch companion and I had the tuna salad on sourdough and the Focaccia Deluxe  (turkey,ham, salami, provolone, lettuce, tomatoes, Parmesan pesto, on Italian herb bread) with a side of potato salad and fruit salad.  I have to admit the Parmesean Pesto spread  was fantastic and the potato salad is the best I ever had.   All the breads at Breadcrafters Bakery and Cafe are made fresh daily.  The Walnut Pecan Raisin, Swiss & Black Pepper, look delicious.  I can't wait to try them all on my next visit.  If your in the area give Breadcrafters a try.  Expect great sandwiches, salads, soups, desserts, and the best customer service.

How Good Depends On What You Order.   I have been to Carolina's a few times, after all it's close to where I work.  The food at Carolona's is hit or miss and the quality really depends on what you order.  Carolina's is a small one story white stucco building with barred windows and doors. The side of the building has huge letters spelling out "Carolina's".  Once inside you walk up to the  order windows  and select your entrée from a large menu above the windows.    As you wait for your entree to arrive you can hear staff calling out order numbers. Once our number was called we made our way up front grabbed our plates and asked for some salsa, that is  available in small paper cups filled by big stainless steel mustard/ketchup pump dispensers.  The hard-shell machaca taco, rice and beans, horchata and tortillas a in the past were amazing. However, I found the cheese enchiladas to be mediocre (tortillas are hard, very little cheese, However, the red sauce is  tasty).  Today I ordered the beef tamale plate and to be honest my entrée was  pretty awful more fat than beef in the tamale, and the tamales had an overwhelming taste of oil. The meal just wasn't very good.  It might be a while before I decide to re-visit Carolina's.

I could spend hours just looking around.  I have many family members and  friends that do quite a bit of traveling. So it's a common occurrence to find myself at Sky Harbor International Airport and that's just fine with me. I could spend hours just looking around Sky Harbor.   One of the things I like best about Sky Harbor is thier showcasing of local favorite restaurants.  Now when I am at Sky Harbor I can check out restuarants like Cowboy Ciao, Humble Pie, Four Peaks Brewery, Sauce, and  Barrio Cafe.  Gone are the days when you were limited to a small selection of coffee type shops.   I actually look forward to going to Sky Harbor because I know I can always grab a bite to eat and a decent glass of wine. Sky Harbor even has a full service Starbucks in the Baggage Claim area.  The City of Phoenix has also added the light rail which conveniently runs  between Economy parking and T4. The TSA agents are friendly yet professional. If you have to travel Sky Harbor is the Airport to choose.

Give It A Chance.  I had never been to Castles and Coasters however, I had an opportunity through work for a private party from 9 am to 1 pm, so I grabbed my nephew and we were off to Castles and Coasters.   I wasn't sure what to expect when we arrived but I went in with an open mind and thought I would give Castles and Coasters a chance.  I am so glad I did.  My newphew and I spent a full day at Castles and Coasters and had a great time. The mini-golf courses are very nice. These courses are fun,well maintained, and nicely laid out. In fact, all the rides at Castles and Coasters are well maintained and a lot of fun. The park was not crowded even after the special engagement hours  ended,  so we were able to go on  the rides many times, and we didn't wait very long in line.  Castle and Coasters  is bigger than it appears from the outside.  There are  several rides in the back of the park so make sure you venture in that direction.  I think the most popular activity was the zip-line and rope bridge attractions out front.  The line moves a bit slow but it's worth the wait.    Castles and Coasters, has two snack bars  however,  you could leave ,go to a nearby restaurant and  return if you prefer. For a snack bar amusement park the food prices were pretty reasonable. A personal pizza and drink for $7.25 made a decent lunch for each of us.  Good rides,  reasonable prices, and a helpful and accommodating staff, it doesn't get much better.

A Really Good HotDog.  I have never been a big fan of hot dogs however, my nephew is so off to Teds we went.  The line at Ted's was long but moved quickly  ( don't let the length of people waiting in line be discouraging). As your waiting in line the  person on the grill will ask you what you would like to order, it's not really shouting but more of a long distance conversation. I actually found ordering that way to be kind of fun.  The hotdogs are shipped in from Buffalo, NY. The charbroiled hot dog have a great flavor and there are so many toppings to choose from. I had one with homemade chili, cheese and onions. It was fantastic. I especially liked the chili. I also ordered the onion rings and they were also very good so if you like hotdogs give Ted's a try.

Not in a rush to visit again.  I have to admit I am not a big fan of Ihop and after a disappointing recent  experience at IHOP, i was unsure if i wanted to go back.  However, I decided to give Ihop one more try.    The service at Ihop was wonderful, we were seated immedately.  Our server was great.  He took our order accurately, and was very friendly.   I ordered the french toast combo  which came with eggs, bacon, hash browns and french toast. After my last experience, I ordered my eggs scrambled instead of over medium and my hash browns well done.  The eggs were very over cooked, and brown as was the bacon. The hash browns came lightly browned, I sent them back. The server came back with some the cooks had said were well done; they were browner on top but again were only cooked on one side. The french toast was okay but a little on the soggy side.  I am a big fan of breakfast.  However, based on my last two visit's to Ihop I'm not in a rush to visit again.

What took me so long?  I have driven by Old Chicago countless times and thought it looked like a fun place to dine, but never stopped to find out. However, that was all about to change. My sister and I decided to give Old Chicago a try for the first time after shopping.  We weren't sure what to expect. However, we were very pleased to be seated quickly and the service couldn't have been better. All I could think to myself was "What took me so long to dine at Old Chicago."  Old Chicago has an impressive selection of imported and exported beers, and you can sample 4 of them for a small price. I settled for a couple of draft Stella's and perused the menu.   The menu at Old Chicago offers a variety of entrée selections  but not so many as to be overwhelming. Old Chicago has a few pizza crusts options with a nice selection of pizza toppings. On this visit my sister and I shared a pizza roll appetizer, Chicago 7 pizza, and the chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream for dessert.  Everything was delicious, especially the pizza and dessert.   The service was friendly and quick. The manager even checked in with us to see if we enjoyed our meal which was appreciated.  We really enjoyed our experience from start to finish.  I will definitely be back and can't believe I waited this long to go Old Chicago.

Disappointed   I use to visit Fuddruckers often. However, I had not been to a Fuddruckers for years.  Today, after watching a movie at AMC Arrowhead, we decided to stop at Fuddruckers for a burger.   This visit to Fuddruckers was disappointing to say the least.  I wish I would have had my phone, so I could have taken a few  photos. The restaurant was partially full. We looked for a table but most of the empty tables were dirty as were the floors, windows, and condiment dispensers. I asked to have our table cleaned  and the staff member wiped it off with much of the table debris landing on our chairs, which we then cleaned ourselves. The staff member then walked up front to speak wuth a fellow work associate. It is hard to imagine, staff members passing by filthy tables, and make no attempt to clean the area.  We ordered bugers, fries, and onion rings. The onion rings were cold, my 1/3 pound burger was ordered medium well and it came out medium rare.  The produce at the "serve yourself" counter was fresh and that area was clean. The food was fair at best. We could have chosen a much cleaner restraunt with better food in that area. The serious lack of cleanliness was an issue for me. Management is clearly at fault.  I must say that all of the staff were friendly.  However, there is no excuse for the condition of this restaurant.  I will not go back.

Never Disappoints  It has been quite some time since I last visited Black Angus Steakhouse.  However, today my sister and I were craving steak for lunch and Black Angus has the absolute best lunch specials when you have a hankering for steak.  Black Angus offers an extensive menu and well prepared food at a reasonable price.  The drink menu is great, and the beer is cold on tap.  We seldom have to wait very long for a table and food is served promptly.  On this visit my sister had a medium rare sirloin steak with grilled roasted corn and a loaded baked potato and raved about it. I had a filet mignon sandwich with grilled onions and roasted red peppers.  The filet mignon was the most tender steak I've ever had, as well as being flavorful, both cuts of meat were cooked to perfection, just as we had ordered them.    Prior to our entrée we were served a small loaf of bread which was delicious and hot from the oven. The bread was hot, crusty, and soft on the inside.  I could have ate the entire loaf myself, but decided to share.  The deserts at Black Angus are to die for, however, we usually take ours home to enjoy later.   Our server was amazing.  Once seated our drinks were served within a few minutes and we were given   a lunch discount card (8.99 for each lunch meal with the purchase of a drink) The Manager at Black Angus knows how to make the customer feel special. During most recent visit, the manager cleared plates,  assisted with getting our desert ready for leaving, and made sure our dining experience was a pleasant one.  We have never had a bad experience at Black Angus and plan to return every time we get the chance.

Always a good purchasing experience   I have to admit I have always enjoyed shopping at Best Buy.  The prices are competitive, and the employees are knowledgeable.  The sales associates offer their assistance,  and offer suggestions without being intrusive.  I never feel pressure to purchase and I can look at and test the electronics   Outstanding customer service & knowledgeable staff keep me coming back.

Recently my health insurance changed and I had to find a new opthamologist, lucky for me I checked Nationwide Vision Center.  The staff at Nationwide Vision Center are helpful, professional, and very accommodating. The staff is  familiar with all the various Insurance companies and can answer any questions you have.  I was taken in for my exam on time and given a very thorough examination of my eyes.  Dr Burr answered every question I had.   After my eye examination I selected my frames and lenses.  Nationwide Vision Center has a decent selection of frames, not as many as my last vision provider,however,  still a good selection.   I am glad I chose Nationwide Vision Center.  If you ever need a vision exam, visit Nationwide you won't be disappointed.

Perfect way to start the morning.  I love my coffee and what's better then a Starbucks. This location is one of my favorites. The service is great and the staff are always very friendly.  The barista might not remember my name but they always remember my drink of choice. This location is clean, inviting, and feels comfortable and they have seating outside at the patio,  can't wait to sit there once it's cooler.  My coffee is always made the way I order and tastes great. In addition, to great coffee Starbucks has delicious pastries if you need a snack. I really enjoy grabbing a cake pop or two to go.  Great coffee, pastries,  friendly staff, and shopping.  It doesn't get any better.

I went into CVS last night because I thought I might be coming down with the flu and thought it would be a good idea to stock up on some over the counter medicine. When I arrive at the store I wasn't quite sure what medicine would be the appropriate medicine to take.  The pharmacist took the time to answer all my questions even suggested a medicine that would work best. I normally do not go to CVS for my prescriptions or over-the-counter drugs. However this will be the place I come in the future. You can't beat this type of customer service. In fact the customer service is so good and fast I didn't have time to walk the aisles looking at the random items you find in drug stores.

Won't be going back.  My sister, nephew, and I went to Applebee's on Tuesday night for a quick bite to eat. We arrived around 6:45 pm and were told that it would be a few minute wait to be seated. Within a few minutes the hostess came by to seat us.  Our server greeted us promptly and told us she would be back in a few minutes to take our drink orders. Since we were short on time we had our entrée's selections ready when our server returned. We all ordered Pepsi to drink. My sister and I ordered the sirloin with a loaded mashed potatos and rice. My nephew had the classic burger with fries, and we shared honey  BBQ wings for an appetizer.  About 10 minutes passed, before our server brought our drinks to the table. The Pepsi tasted flat so we asked our server for a different drink selection, Sierra Mist. Another 10 minutes passed before  our server brought our soft drinks to the table, however the Sierra Mist was also flat. So we opted for water.  Another 12 or 15 minutes pass before our appetizer was brought to the table. The honey bbq wings were drenched in bbq sauce, soggy, and just didn't taste good.  We wait  some more, and finally our entrée's arrive.  I notice that the loaded mashed potato were not hot, but only a bit warm and the rice is crunchy and over cooked. The steak that I ordered medium rare is more like well done, dry, and lacked any seasoning. My sisters entree was as bad as mine and my nephews burger was absolutely dry and lacked and type of flavor.  Our server does not come back for quite some time. Again we are in a hurry.  I try to eat my meal, and I actually finished about 1/3 of my entree when I decided to just pay my bill and leave. Finally, our server comes back, asked if my nephew still wanted a refill on his drink that we ordered 20 minutes prior, or if we wanted take out boxes for our entrée's.  I replied no, to the refill, and no to boxes.  This by far was one of the worst dining experiences I have had in some time.

Second to none, and the sales force is knowledgeable and informative.  The crew at Discount Tires is second to none. It was about 3:45, Saturday afternoon when I noticed, what I thought was a small leak in one of my tires. I brought my vehicle to Discount Tire to have the tire looked at before it went flat.   Once I arrived at Discount Tires I noticed the place was packed and closed at 5:00 pm. I asked the sales associate if there was any possibility to have a tire checked for a leak, and he said, "absolutely". The sales associate took my information and advised that I was due for a tire rotation so they would take care of that as well.   My tire was just low on air pressure, no leak, the tires were rotated, and I was back on the road by 4:30, at no charge.   Discount Tire has consistently performed at a level seldom seen these days. The sales force is knowledgeable and can make solid suggestions if you give them sufficient information as to your needs. I am so glad I went to and will continue to go to Discount Tires.

Won't go back again.  It been over a year since I visited Macayo's.  I use to go to Macayo's often but stopped when the service and quality of food started to decline.  However, today, I thought I would give Macayo's another chance.   The quality of food and service is worse then I remembered.  Macayo's has competitive pricing for a typical Mexican restaurant in the area, however, the food just isn't good and the service borders on teribble.  So, lets start with the service. The service at this Macayo's location  has always been ridiculously slow.  Today, I anticipated slow service due to large crowds on Valentines Day.  What I did not expect was having to wait 20 minutes for a refill on soda, then having a to ask a bus person for a refill, and once I received the refill finding something floating on top, and waiting another 10 minutes for a drink. I waited once again over 10 minutes, for a to go box, and another 20 minutes after our server took my credit card for payment.     Let's move onto the food.  The entrees themselves are not good.  It seems that I have always had an issue with one thing or another on my past few visits.  Today, we had a cheese crisp, which was served on a stale tortilla with very little cheese.  In fact the cheese peeled off from the tortilla.  My nephew had the kids taco plate, which he did not like.  He mentioned the meat tasted "funny". I tried one of tacos and agreed the taco meat was greasy and tasteless. I had the tamale bites with Baja Sauce and although the tamale bites were good the Baja sauce tasted old and had a thick "skim" layer on top that I discarded. Once again our server was no where to be found.   All in all a horrible dining experience.  We were at Macayo's for over an hour forty minutes because we waited for chips, waited for drink, waited for bill, waited for to go containers, waited for server to return my credit card.

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly   I enjoy eating out in different restaurants on a regular basis. After a long day of shopping I decided to stop at the Cracker Barrel, Hadn't been to Cracker Barrel in a long time but every time I drive past it's always packed so I thought the Cracker Barrel would be good food choice. WOW was I wrong!!   The service was slow, and the food was tasteless and cold.  It was the worst dining experience I've had in a long time. Even though we ate very little off our plates it wasn't until - the cashier asked me "how was the food"; that anyone even showed concern. I told the cashier it was "terrible it just wasn't good".  I wasn't going to speak to a manager initially however; the two cashiers talked me into speaking with a manger. After waiting 20 minutes for a manager, I walked away with one thought on my mind. I will never go back again.

My First and Last Visit   So I always hear people say how they  love the Waffle House and in all my years I had never been to one, but I wanted to try it. Unfortunately that was a  mistake.  I have to be honest I  wasn't impressed when we walked in, however, I tried to keep an open mind, after all I couldn't expect fine dining.  It didn't take long before I knew I'd never visit another Waffle House again.   The first hint was the horrible smell that could only be compared to a port a jon. Next was the  dirty greasy menu and spotty silverware the waitress delivered to the table.  Then our food came and everything appeared to have been cooked in old grease, the food tasted absolutely horrible. The waitress noticed we weren't eating much and asked  if everything was ok. We paid the bill and quickly left to free up the table.  I know many people like the Waffle House and that's great , but the Waffle House just wasn't for me. At least I satisfied my curiosity.

Barnes and Nobel is a Great Family Place to read and grab a cold drink.  Barnes and Nobel is a good place for current titles. The staff is always helpful, friendly and courteous. As a member, I enjoy the special discounts and the great variety of "bargain books."  My visit's to Barnes and Nobel are always an adventure! I bring my nephew to Barnes and Nobel for family time.  We enjoy looking for books and reading.  Barnes and Nobel is also a nice place to grab a quick bite and some coffee. Maybe get some work done or just some quite time to sit and read.

I will always prefer a bookstore to an EBook.   I saddens me to see  the loss of bookstores everywhere.  However,  I'm glad to see a few bookstores still standing, and Barnes and Nobel is one of my favorites.  Barnes and Noble has everything I enjoy about bookstores, great selections, friendly and helpful staff, Starbucks with comfortable couches & chairs.  There is just something I find peaceful and relaxing about being able to read a book sitting on a chair in the middle of a quiet aisle drinking a caramel macchiato . I guess that's why I will ways prefer a bookstore over Ebooks.

Over the counter medicines and so much more.   I went to Walgreens because I was feeling a little under the weather and thought it would be good to stock up on some over the counter medicine.  When I arrived at the store I wasn't quite sure what medicine totake. The pharmacist could easily see I was confused and offered his assiatance.  After selecting my over the counter medicines I walked around the store and purchased juice, a few snacks, and even a "as seen on tv" item or two.  Walgreens is a great place to grab exactly what you need any time of the day of night.

A Gem Right In Litchfield Park  A out of town friend stayed a few mights at the Wigwam Resort.  I have to admit I love the wigwam.  The Wigan is a  Historical hotel that has modernized but has been able to retain the historical past beautifully.  The Wigwam has magnificent restaurant, beautiful golf courses, day spa,  places to walk, pools, bocce courts, and volleyball.  When you stay at the Wigwam you never have to leave the resort because the Wigwam has it all.

Always A Great Experience   Our family has visited Wildlife World Zoo and Aquarian on several occasions and it has always been a great experience. Wildlife World Zoo and Aquarian is a privately funded zoo, therefore you won't see the extensive landscaping and paved pathways you would encounter at other zoo's. However, I think Wildlife Zoo and Aquarian has a rustic vibe that the whole family appreciates and enjoys.  The Wildlife World Zoo and Aquarian  is not as crowded as a other zoo's, so there is a casual feeling as you stroll down the pebble pathways.  You truly have a opportunity  to appreciate and enjoy the animals without feeling rushed.    Each visit to Wildlife World Zoo and Aquarian  we encounter something new and exciting. I really enjoy all the exhibits which seem more intimate then at other zoo's.  It's amazing to look at a large mountain cat as you stand under its net.  I have never been that close to a cat that size at any other zoo.  There is so much to do at the Wildlife World Zoo and Aquarian.  You can stand on an elevated deck and feed the girrafes, feed apples to parrots. There is an air tram, a safari train, a carousel, a boat ride through the "outback",  petting zoo and animal shows which are  educational and fun. You can't get all of this at other zoo's.  You have to see the aquarium which is predominantly indoors and nice for those warmer Arizona afternoons. The aquarium is full of fish, eels, otters, penguins, a new sea lion show, and a petting tank for the various rays are not to be missed.   I could go on and on, words don't do justice.  Stop by and see for yourself.

The Real Deal... A taste of NYC in Surprise   The staff at My Daddy's Cafe are warm, friendly, and inviting to everyone that walks in the store even when the lines are out the door. This Bakery reminds me of back home in Brooklyn.  My Daddys bakery has all the hard to find Italian pastries.  The Napoleones, Canolis, butter cookies, and crumb cakes are the best. Nothing tops their  rainbow cookies and my all time favorite Marzipan Princess Slices.  In addition to pastries this bakery offers sandwiches and take home pasta dishes. I tried the meatballs and gravy and it was delicious. The gravy tastes like my grandma made back home in Brooklyn.  Give this bakery a try, you won't be disappointed and you will leave with a smile on your face.

Mangia bene, vivi felice   Today, I decided to revisit Cucina Tagliani.  I have to say, we thoroughly enjoyed our dining expeirence at Cucina Tagliani, as we have so many times in the past.   Cucina Tagliani has two locations. One in Peoria and one in Glendale.  The atmosphere in both restaurants is inviting and reminds me of trips to Italy.   The menu at Cucina Tagliani offers a  variety of selections and prices to accommodate all budgets.  Our server was well versed with the menu specials, offered suggestions, and was very attentive without being intrusive.   I tend to stay with the standard Italian fare and Cucina Tagliani never disappoints.  Today, I choose the baked zita and my entrée was absolute perfection. In additon, to amazing tasting entrée's Cucina Tagliani's has an impressive listing of wines to accomdate your meal.  The service at Cucina Tagliani's is first rate, and the atmosphere is pleasant.  We will definitely dine at Cucina Tagliani again. I would recommend Cucina Tagliani's to anyone.

Not What I Remembered   It's been a long time since I've eaten at Sing High.  I use to visit Sing High often however, my last few lunch expeirences have not been positive.      Today, I decided to stop by Sing High for a quick bite to eat.  I was asked if I wanted a booth or table. Since this was going to be a working lunch I asked for a booth.  The server was initially going to sit me by a large group of people.  Normally, I wouldn't ask for a different booth but the restaurant  was empty.  So I asked the server for a diffrent both and it was obvious he was annoyed at my request but allowed me to switch booths.  I ordered  the lunch special which  consisted of sweet & sour shrimp, egg foo young, chicken chow mein, and rice.  The service was fast, however the food was just fair, so don't expect too much. The rice was very sticky and lacked flavor. The sweet and sour shrimp dripped of oil, the chicken chow mein had almost no chicken at all, and the egg foo young just wasn't good.  I'm not sure if this will be my last visit, but it will be my last visit for a while.  Sing High is just not what I remembered.

A great deli with good food and service.  Park Central  is a great traditional deli with a large varied menu. Today we had the sloppy Joe and it was very good, as were the side dishes and desserts.  Our Sloppy Joe sandwiches were big, very big, and very flavourful  and Park Central  doesn't skimp on the meat. Even the children's  menu is a bargain. It's rare to find a deli where the food is good and still be able to satisfy my nephews craving for a grilled cheese sandwich.   Deli staff comes around to see if you need a refill, napkins, or just to ask if you need your table cleared of dishes.  It is comon to see staff carrying food to tables for elderly patrons or mothers with small children.  What more can I say, good food, good  service.  A warm, friendly atmosphere where one feels like a valued customer.

A Must See   This theater was perserved as an historic landmark, and once you visit the Orpheum it becomes obvious why. The inside of the Orpheum theater is painted to resemble the outdoors complete with stars in the night sky.  The Orpheum has this incredible pipe organ that was used during the 1920's  when the Orpheum presented silent movies.  The theatre is beautiful and represents baroque, roman as well as art deco features.  The acoustics are amazing.   I have always enjoyed every musical or theatrical production I have seen at the Orpheum. It is a shame there are so few  regular performances at the Orpheum theater.   If you do find an event to attend at this historic landmark, make sure to arrive early to explore the beautiful scenery and architecture.

Name Brands For Less  I really enjoy going to Marshalls, even though I don't go often.  Marshalls offers very affordable name brand products, at a much lower cost then other department stores. Marshalls selection of clothing, assessories, luggages, cosmetics, electronics goods might not be as large as other department stores however, if you have the time to look, you can find what yoy want.   Marshalls is the place to go if you want to find gifts for your family, friends, or yourself at bargain prices.  The store is clean and the staff are helpful.   Recently, I was looking for metal mason jars with lids and straws.  Most of the other depaetment stores wanted 12 99 - 16.99 per cup.  I found exactly what I wanted at Marshalls for 3.99 each. Marshalls  is a great  department stores to shop, especially for home decor.

Auto mechanics you can trust!  I would like to thank Dave, Keith, and the rest of the crew at Back to Basic Automative. I have used Back to Basic Automative on numerous occasions from oil changes to alignment work and everything in between. The guys at Basic to Basic are honest, trustworthy, and always explain what needs to be done, and my vehicles are always repaired in a timely matter.  Honesty, experience, and expertise are just a few of the attributes at Back to Basic Automative. You can't beat the  great customer service, thorough work, and more than fair pricing. Back to Basic can't be beat! (I've been a customer for a very long time and will remain a customer for good.)

I'll gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today.  Who needs a sports bar when you can go to the Original Hamburger Works. The restaurant might not look like much from the outside but like the old adage goes "You can't judge a book by its cover" the same can be said about The Original Hamburger Works.   The Original Hamburger Works has a sports bar vibe and inviting atmosphere, with lots of TV's that show sports all over the restaurant, and the restaurant  is spacious, well kept, and clean.  The burgers are big, fresh, and made to order. You select what size burger you want, type of cheese, and type of bun, and then the fun begins.  The Original Hamburger Works offers a condiment wagon filled with various burger fixens.  The condiments bar is a nice addition because your simply given your flame grilled burger and bun and the rest is up to you.  So be prepared to pile on the "fixins" at no extra charge.  Great food, reasonable prices, and amazing customer service.  What more could you ask for.

Fuggedaboutit  This was my first visit to McGurkee's but it won't be my last. McGurkee's is a small shop with great character, McGurkee's reminds me of the sandwich shops back home in New York.  McGurkee's has limited parking, because it is so popular with the lunch crowd, so you need to get there early.   The sandwiches at McGurkee's are a cut above the rest.  The bread  at McGurkee's is exactly how I like it;  fresh, toasted, thin, with a crispy crust.  If you can find a  better bread in town please let me know.  The  fillings at MvGurkee's are excellent and very generous.  I had the Sicilian and it was delicious and loaded .  My lunch campionions had the Hero and Roast Beef and they were equally delicious.   If you think you can find a better sandwich shop ...  Fuggedaboutit

Bulk items at great prices   I like going to Smart and Finial when I  need to restock my supply of paper products such as, paper towels, paper plates, napkins  Kleenex, or when its my turn to fill the candy jar at work.  I tend to save a lot of money when I purchase certain items in large quanties at Smart and Finial.  Smart and Finial has large bags fruit, such as apples and oranges.  The fruits are always fresh and offered at a great price.  Smart and finial isn't as big as other wearhouse  stores but it still a good place to go.

Hampton Inn  Doesn't Disappoint    A out of town  friend was scheduled for surgery and decided to stay at the Hampton Inn Phoenix Mid-Town/Downtown location. I have to say The Hampton Inn is a great place to stay.  The Hampton Inn is a gem, the rooms are well kept, beds are comfortable, and the staff goes out of their way to make sure your stay is enjoyable . The Hampton Inn offers complimentary breakfast, free wifi, and these absolutely delicious  cookies at the front desk each afternoon. I could have easily ate a bunch of cookie (sometimes I did just that). The rooms are really quiet so  you can rest without any noise  disturbance from your neighbors and the Inn is  located near a variety of food choices within walking distance.  If you are every looking for a great place to stay in the downtown area, give Hampton Inn a try.

Double Dipping Allowed.  Sometimes you can't judge a book by its cover.  This is true about Mi Patio Mexican Grill. The restaurant may not be  much to look at from the outside, however it's definitely worth going in.  Your greeted the moment you walk in the door by staff that are very friendly and inviting.  Once seated you are immediately served a large bowl of warm chips and salsa.  The chips and salsa at Mi Patio Mexican Grill are  fresh and so addicting. What I liked best is  each person gets their own bowl of salsa, so double dip all you want and believe me you will want to.  The salsa at Mi Patio is the best I've had in a very long time.  The portions at Mi Patio are huge. I ordered a taco and enchilada combination plate  and could not finish my entrée. I haven't found a cheese enchilada any where near this good.   Price are reasonable and service excellent.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone that enjoys mexican food.

My tire was just low on air pressure, no leak, the tires were rotated, and I was back on the road in no time flat.   Discount Tire has consistently performed at a level seldom seen these days. The sales force is knowledgeable and can make solid suggestions if you give them sufficient information as to your needs. I am so glad I went to and will continue to go to Discount Tires.

Disappointed   I hear only good thing about Burger Mania and thought it's about time I try this place.  Unfortunately, I have to say that the food on this visit wasn't  good.  The burgers at Burger Mania are exceptionally bland.  To be honest initially, when I unwrapped my burger and took the first bite I thought there wasn't a patty on the bun. When I pulled the top of the bun off I saw a very small thin patty covered in condimemts.  The burger had so many condiments it made the bun soggy and it fell apart.  The fries at Burger Mania were crispy and hot however, the fries had an odd tasting seasoning and just weren't very good.  On a positive note the service at Burger Mania is fast and the prices are on the low end.  However, if you are looking for a tasty traditional  burger or would like to enjoy a burger  with a twist, I would forgo Burger Mania.

A lunch companion and I visited Garcias this afternoon for a quick lunch.  As we entered the restaurant  we were greeted and seated immediately. The decor in Garcias is warm and inviting with its Spanish architecture, paint, tiles and Mexican music in the background.   As we were seated our chips, salsa,  and drinks arrived almost immediately.  The chips are served hot with chunky red salsa and a refried bean dip. The chips are hot, very thin, crispy and salted perfectly and the bean dip is delicious.  The menu at Garcias has a good variety of entrees, all reasonably priced for a full service establishment. The staff at Garcias are friendly without being intrusive.  The food is delivered quickly, hot, and plated attractively with generous servings.   My lunch companion and I both had the burrito fundido which was probably one of the best I've had. Each entrée  comes with typical rice and refried beans with a little lettuce and tomato.  For dessert we had the fried ice cream which is quite good. One large scoop of vanilla ice cream that has been fried on top of a cinnamon honey crunchy tortilla with whip cream.  We enjoyed a delicious lunch at a very reasonable price.  If you're ever in the neighborhood give Garcias a try, you won't be disappointed.

Disappointing.   Im going to start my review of Ming's Pagoda on a positive note.  The service at Ming's Pagoda was quick and the staff  was accomdating,  the food however was not good.   The egg drop soup was thick and lacked flavor and the wontons were stale and challenging to chew. On my first visit to Ming's Pagoda I had the lemon chicken. The lemon chicken was very disaponting. The coating was crunchy but the chicken was dry, not moist at all, and there was just to much lemon sauce placed over the chicken.  My lunch companion had the chicken lo mein.  The noodles were somewhat greasy and once again the chicken was dry. The fried rice, eggrolls, and fried wontons were equally disappointing.  Not the best restaurant experience.

All Donuts are Not Created Equal  If you're under the impression that donuts are donuts, then you havent been to Rainbow Donuts.  We needed a quick breakfast before Church and stumbled upon Rainbow Donuts.   Rainbow Donuts offers amazing donuts in various flavors and fillings. These donuts have the perfect texture and taste. I had regular glazed, chocolate cream filled, and a cinnamon sugar donut, and each was delicious.   Rainbow Donuts is a small shop with a handful of tables to eat at, but as we sat many came in and purchased donuts to go. A dozen donuts was around $9, not a bad price.

MY FIRST TIME ..  BUT NOT MY LAST   A bucket of peanuts and a basket of hot bread with cinnamon butter from the moment you sit down. How could it get any better then that!! It could get much better if you remember to get there before 6Pm for the earlier bird specials.  I had the steak and rib dinner. The portions were large and cooked to perfection.  The ribs were tender fall of the bone delicious! I will be back and bring my rib eating friends.   The steak is so melt in your mouth tender it really is like butter!  Better than any Ruth's Chris or Morton's out there and at a great price!! The service is as good as the food. Lots of attention from the staff.  This place is amazing - its #1 for me in the steakhouse category and will be my go to spot when i want to have an amazing dining experience and great food!

Great Pie  I am a big fan of quality pizza and it has been awhile since I've eaten at Brothers Pizza, so I thought it was about time to visit Brothers once again.  Brothers specializes in New York Style Pizza. Brothers offers a great variety of toppings and specialty pizzas that are well-worth checking out.   On this visit I ordered a Large Pepperoni Pizza and 20 wings.  The pizza was piping hot, had a great doughy crust, flavorful sauce, right amount of pepperoni, and was quite delicious as were the wings.  The service at Brothers has always been prompt and friendly. Try to head there during non-peak times as I have noticed their busiest times are from about 5:30 pm to 6:30 pm but always worth the wait.

Guess it's not my thing.   I've  been to Mongolian barbecues in the past and the food has been okay to good , however Aj's Mongolian Grill falls short of being good or even okay.  The meats appear to be frozen and when cooked have a tendency to lack taste and are some what  grainy,  the noodles were gummy and I hate to repeat myself  but they to were flavorless.  The veggies are also frozen which causes the veggies to  lose a lot of their flavor when cooked. I realized after tasting my meal that I should have drenched my dish in sauce in order to get some semblance of flavor   Even the ice cream for dessert lacks luster.  No toppings, just soft serve vanilla ice cream.  However, if you wanted crushed nuts to top your ice cream there  was a peanut dispenser that cost 25 cents.   If you decide you want to take your meal home that will cost you 75 cents for a carry out container. To be honest the only thing that was good was the fountain drinks.   Maybe Mongolian grills are not my thing.

Gyros=Yee Row  I was looking for a lunch alternative and happened on to King Gyros in Phoenix, located in a strip mall. From the outside King Gyro doesn't look like much, and you need to park around the corner in the strip mall parking lot. However, the inside of King Gyro is very clean, well kept, and inviting.    I'm a huge Gyro fan and insist the word is  pronounced Yee Row. On this visit my lunch companion and I ordered a Steak Gyro and Chicken Cesar Salad, and both entrée's were delicious.   The Steak Gyro was huge and filled with meat, this Gyro was big enough to feed two. The sauce was perfect, not too tart and the bread was fresh, warm and delicious. The Chicken Cesar Salad was also very good.  The chicken was moist and flavorful.  The lettuce was fresh and crisp, and the dressing flavorful.  I would go back there everyday if I lived in that area.

I found my new favorite Chinese restaurant in the valley.  What a surprise this place is. I went to Abacus Inn after reading all the good reviews and Abacus lives up to expectations.  I think it's safe to say I've found my new favorite Chinese restaurant in the valley.  ABACUS INN is simply delicious!    The Mongolian beef was to DIE FOR.  The Mongolian Beef was tender and seasoned perfectly. The portions are huge, I was full after the appetizers as was my lunch companion, so I took a lot of food home, and it tasted great the next day.   Abacus Inn is reasonably priced, friendly staff, excellent food, and very generous portions.  Our waitress was very sweet and attentive.  I especially appreciated that she boxed up the leftovers instead of just dropping off some boxes at the table.   Now that I found this gem, I'll be sure to go back.  If you haven't tried it, go...NOW.

Not So Good.  I really hate to give restaurant a less then favorable review.  Especially when the reviews are really good.  So lets start off on a positive note.  The staff New Asian Kitchen are friendly and very accommodating.   The service is fast and the prices are reasonable.  However, The food just wasn't that good. The pork and  chicken lo mein was very greasy and tasteless. The  vegetables were overcooked and soggy. The egg roll was cooked nicely, but just didn't have a good flavor.  The same could be said about the won tons and crab puffs.     I cannot  give New Asian Kitchen a good recommendation but in a pinch, you could do worse.

Great Place to Purchase  Games  I always preorder games from game stop, I enjoy going in and looking at the selection of pre-owned games.  I have never had a negative customer service issues,  or damaged game (scratches/unplayable).  The sales associates who work at Game Stop are knowledgeable and offer advice and suggestions and are willing to spend time answering any questions you might have.  If you're a gamer you should give Gane Stop a try.

St Thomas Aquinas is a beautiful church.  When I first moved to the west valley I wanted to find a church that made me feel at home.  I found that at St Thomas Aquinas.  The parishoners,  Fr. Kieran and the rest of the staff are friendly and inviting. If you want to be truly inspired, stop by and say hello.

Compare Department Stores   Kohl's may not be my favorite store however, the customer service is bar none, and the return policy can't be beat.   I have never had any problems with anything I've purchased at any of the Kohl's store or their online services. Kohl's offers great prices and sales. I usually take advantage of theor 30% off coupons.  I have a lot of family and friends who shop at Kohl's, and they are always pleased . The quality is great for the price.

No waiting and great customer service.  I visited the Verizon Store in Avondale on Rancho Sante Fe  and I felt welcomed right away. Usually, when I visit a Verizon store they take my name and I wait, then I wait some more but not this time.   Rolando greeted us right away and was very helpful with sorting out the best tablet and cell phone to purchase.  Rolando was exceptionally knowledgeable throughout the upgrade process (which was unbelievable quick).  Rolando went through  all the plan options and coverages.   What I appreciated about Rolando was that he was professional, and he didn't try to pressure me into making a purchase.  I'd recommend anyone to this verizon store! Wonderful experience and amazing staff!

Excellent service.   I usually don't shop here but I am going to start.  As I went into the store I was greeted by 2 sales reps. One took me to the item I needed and the other suggested another item that would be similar and more convenient.   All my questions were answered, prices are competitive, large selection, and helpful staff .

My Favorite Petsmart  This is absolutely the best Petsmart I have ever visited . I  would be willing to go out of my way to go to this location because the service is so much better than the other Petsmart stores in the area. However,  I am fortunate that this Petsmart Location is close to my home.   Clean stores,  knowledgeable staff, and employees  who are willing to answer your questions and help you out in any way they can, it doesn't get much better than that.

Always a good place to grab just what you need.  I went in to Walgreens because I was feeling a little under the weather and thought it would be a good idea to stock up on some over the counter medicine.  When I arrived at the store I wasn't quite sure what medicine would be the best medicine to take.   The pharmacist could easily see I was confused however he took the time to ask me questions and answer all the questions I had, and even suggested some over the counter medicines that might make me feel better.    After grabbing some over-the-counter medicine I took advantage of walking down the aisles and looking at all the items  carried at your local drug stores. I walked out of the store with medicine, juice, snacks, and even a "as seen on tv" item or two.  Walgreens is a great place to grab just what you need.

Quick Trip is always a great gas station to refuel, as well as freshen up and who doesn't love the soda fountain station and multitude of snacks.    Cheap gas, ice cold drinks, and snacks. Does it get any better.

Nice store and competitive pricing   I am a frquent shopper at Bed Bath & Beyond. They have a good selection and comoetitive prices on products. Bed Bath and Beyond has an  easy return return policy and they let you use coupons that are expired.  Yes, you can probably go somewhere else and find similar products however, the products and level of customer service will not be as good.   I have gone into Bed Bath & Beyond  looking for specific items and if they don't have the item stocked they have offered to order and have the item  shipped.   Competitive pricing and great customer service will keep me coming back.

Crepes, just so good.  Fresh hot brewed coffee and free Wi-Fi aren't the only reasons I have to get my IHop fix. I go to IHop for their crepes.   IHop offers a great selection of sweet and savory crepes.   From the Sweedish, Nutella, to the strawberry with cream cheese Ihop will surley have a crepe to satisfy your cravings . If sweet crepes aren't your thing Ihop offers a variety of chicken and spinach crepe options, that are equally delicious.  If crepes aren't for you IHop's variety of omelettes and delicious pancakes will surely hit the spot.

Never Disappoints   With so many Mexican Food Restaurants do any really stand out above the rest?  If you have to ask that question then you have never been to Raul and Teresa's.  The West Valley has had its share of good Mexican restaurants.  So what makes Raul and Theresa's stand out? For starters, it's not the typical version of Mexican food drowned in sauce,  rice, and heavy beans. The dishes at Raul and Theresa's are excellent. The entrees are flavorful, served hot, and plated perfectly. Today, I had the taco and enchilada lunch combo and it was delicious.  Raul and Theresa's has two locations, one on Litchfield Road and the original location off of M-85 ( I prefer the M-85 location).    Raul and Theresa's has a very relaxed atmosphere, plenty of room for large parties, and is kid friendly.  The service and food  is absolutely wonderful. If your in the area and hungry for Mexican Food stop by Raul a d Theresa's  you will not be disappointed.

Always hit and miss- but mostly miss  I rarely take the time on my days off from work to sit down for a large lunch in a good restaurant (I do for dinner). During lunch hour I am usually on a roll and I don't have the time for extended lunches.  With that in mind I am always searching for a good and quick place to eat. Unfortunately, Del Taco falls short.    I have  said it many times before, I'm not a fan of Del Tacos food because their tacos do not have much filling in them, even when you order the double meat double cheese and the quality of food is always hit and miss.  However, my nephew enjoys the  food  at Del Taco so we decided to give it a shot. We decided to go through the drive thru.  I ordered two of the number six meals which included 2 double beef double cheese tacos, fries, and a drink.  I asked for the fries to be made "extra crispy" in hopes of getting fresh fries.  My hopes were crashed at least partially. As we pulled away I realized that one order of fries was fresh and hot while the other order was cold and stale. The frustrating thing beyond the cold fries was I asked the employee at the drive thru if the fries were fresh and extra crispy and she replied "yes".  The quality as a whole at Del Taco has seem to gone downhill fast.  I realize that Del Taco is a fast food establishment and fast food is what your going to get and I am fine with that. Howerever, I do believe the food should be fresh and made to order.  This doesn't appear to be the case with Del Taco. I have spoken to management on different occasions about the quality of food and have had meals replaced.  I will not be going back to Del Taco any time soon.

A Fast Food Favorite  Whataburger has been in the business of serving food for a very long time. You cant make it in the fast food industry for as long as Whatburger has by serving bad food.    The service at Whataburger is always fast, friendly, and accurate. My nephew and I ordered our food and went to a table, before I knew it our food was brought to the table. The food was fresh, hot, and oh so good.  The burger patties at Whatburger  aren't thick  but the lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle, mustard and bun really do make for a tasty burger.   I also enjoy Whatburger's breakfast items.  The Breakfast on a Bun with sausage and grilled onions is pretty good, as are the pancakes. Whatburger has  everything you want for breakfast at a reasonable cost !

Just not for me  Tonight, I decided I would stop by Lighthouse Sports Bar.  I have passed by the Lighthouse countless times but have never stopped by to see what it's all about.  The atmosphere was okay, you could tell some of the patrons were regulars and knew the the staff. On this visit a few friends and I ordered a few drinks and decided to take advantage of the pool tables.  I have to admit the service at the Lighthouse was a tad slow and the bar isn't as clean as it could or should be. There were a few people that had to much to drink and after a argument with other patrons were asked to leave.  The Lighthouse isn't the worst place I have been to and you could do worse in a pinch. However, the lighthouse just isn't for me.

Great Learning Environment   It can be intimadating when you're learning a new sport and have lots of questions.  Recently, I've had an interest in learning more about golf.  As a complete amateur I was  just looking to spend an hour or so hitting some balls, who would have known how much I enjoyed it. Valley Golf Center has a double-decker driving range, and  offers a nice course for pros and beginners like myself to practice golf. What I found most enjoyable is I didn't feel awkward or uncomfortable because I was a beginner.  I have to admit I do not know the difference between artificial turf and real grass and how that affects your golf game. However, the landing area looks and feels great, and the cost of hitting a few buckets seemed inexpensive, and you can usually find great deals on Groupon.  I think I'm ready to take some lessons at Valley Golf Center. The staff is knowledgeable and accommodating. It's a nice change to have  staff go out of their way to help you make educated decisions and feel welcomed regardless of your experience level.

The Kind of Place You Want To Bring A Book or Newspaper to and Just Eat and Relax  The valley is filled with places to pick up breakfast. There are the typical doughnut and bagel shops to the sit-down chain restaurants. However, once in a while, if your lucky, you come across that one neighborhood place that turns out to be a "stand-out spot".  You know what I mean, the place that everyone flocks to.  Well that place happens to be Brothers Family Restaurant!  Today was my first visit to Brothers Family Restaurant and all I can say is, it won't be my last. Brothers is clean, the staff is friendly, the service is fast, the food is  very tasty, perfectly made and did I mention great prices.  Brothers has one of the best family style menus around, from the countless egg dishes, to the usual breakfasts favorites, like, pancakes, French toast,  biscuits &gravy, omelettes, skillets...you name it, Brothers serves it.  Their  chorizo & green chili omelette with home style potatoes is to die for.   Best Breakfast Ever!   I would absolutely recommend Brothers Family Restaurant to everyone.

A little taste of New York in Sun City  Being a native New Yorker, I am always on a quest for Italian bakeries in Arizona.  However, authentic Italian Bakeries are not so easy to find in Arizona. So when I came across New York West Pastry and Bake Shop I knew I hit the lottery. I found my little taste of New York in Sun City, Arizona.  New York West has all the typical Italian pastries, Linzer tarts, napoleon,rainbow cookies, pignoli, pie pockets, devil dogs, salt sticks, and one of my favorites sfogliatelle.    In addition to absolutely delicious pastries New York West is also a full service bakery. I mean, they carry rolls, breads, bagels, and even pizza dough.   The breads and rolls are flaky, buttery and perfectly delicious. New York West has it all.  The customer service is second to none at New York West. It is rare to walk into a bakery that you haven't been to for some time and the owner not only remembers you but recalls your favorite pastry's, now that's what I call great customer service. All the staff at New York West are friendly, accommodating, and patient.  After all,  it can take a while to decide exactly what you want to eat.   If your ever in the area and want delicious pastry's, stop by New York West you won't be disappointed.

Pharmacy is always great   I went to Walgreens because I was feeling a little under the weather and thought it would be good to stock up on some over the counter medicine. As I was looking for the items I needed to purchase I was asked if I needed assistance and if I found everything I was looking for.  It's nice to see people go out of theory way to make sure your shopping expeirence is positive.  After selecting some over the counter medicines I walked around the store and purchased juice, a few snacks, and even a "as seen on tv" item or two.  Walgreens is a great place to grab exactly what you need any time of the day of night and the staff is always friendly and helpful.

I'll take a pass.  The staff at Irma's Mexican Food are warm, friendly, and extremely personable, which is why I feel terrible for calling out their Mexican food as bland, tasteless, and poorly executed.  The food at Irma's isn't so much bad as it is bland, and the presentation is sloppy, even for a fast food establishment. On this visit we had the Beef Tacos and Barbacoa Sopas, all of which border on terrrible. The Barbacoa Sopas were drowned in a tastelesd red sauce with a very small amount of  diced up pieces of meat, and  topped off with a combination of cheese, grease, and more grease. The food could have been worse,  unpleasant flavors would certainly be worse than no flavor at all.  I wasn't expecting fine dining, nor was I expecting terrible Mexican dishes.

Enough Said  What can be said about Pizzeria Bianco that hasn't been said 1476 times before. I've been to Pizzeria Bianco on several occasions and the food and service  live up to all the hype.   All the entrée's at Pizzeria Bianco are delicious.  However, my favorites are the caprese salad, Sonny boy pizza with a glass of wine, what a perfect meal.  The taste, texture and flavors of the woodfired oven pizza is second to none. I understand why there is usually a wait when going to Pizzeria Bianco. So if you get frustrated while waiting in line, which is a normal nightly occurance, I suggest going on the off-hours. If you're in the area give Pizzeria Bianco a try and then you can say "I had some of the best pizza in the US"

Open Air and Air Conditioned .... What a Great Stadium   Grab your friends and kids and take a tour of Chase Field.  You won't regret it.  Other than the groundskeepers and your tour guide, you will have the field to yourselves.  It's so much fun and it's reasonably priced. Adults are just 7 dollars and kids are only 3.  Chase Field is definitely unique with its  dbTV, large video scoreboards, and my favorite the  retractable roof to keep us baseball fans comfortable during the heat of the summer.   The pool in right field, numerous restaurants, including Friday's Front Row sets Chase field above the rest.  So take a tour and see what Chase has to offer.

So if your looking for a great cup of coffee,an inviting atmosphere, then  Lux should be on your list of places to visit while in Phoenix.

Unique concept - poor execution  After hearing about Chino Bandido for years, we found ourselves nearby at lunch time and really looked forward to trying this place out.  Chino Bandido has a unique concept, however, I feel,  the food is poorly executed.    My co-worker and I didn't particularly care for the flavor of the  food. Maybe we were expecting more because of the all the great reviews and  recommendations we read. To be perfectly honest, the food was nothing terribly special, and simply putting mexican food on a bed of white rice shouldn't be confused with real fusion cuisine.     On this visit my lunch companion and I ordered the machaca bowls.  The bowls are  served in tin takeout containers. The machaca had an odd taste and was on the dry side and the rice was warm at best. The meal just wasnt very good.   On a positive note, the menu choices are unique, and Chino Bandido does an excellent job of allowing you to sample the various items, and the service is outstanding. At the end of the day though, the food was pretty basic. I would say the Snickerdoodle cookie that comes with each entree was the best part of the meal.

..... And there's a new winner in town.  I really enjoy a good pie, as most of us do.  Lately, I've been finding myself at Cibo.  I use to fequent another spot in the Phoenix area for my pizza cravings however, that has all changed.   So if your searching for  authentic Italian food, at  a reasonable price.  Look no further Cibo is the place for you.   Every pizza on the menu at Cibo looks amazing. I cant wait to try them all.  So far my favorotes are the Salsiccia and and Diavola.  However, I would be neglectful if I  didn't' mention the calzones which are absolutely delicious, the best I ever had.  You have to start your meal with one  of Cibo's aperterisers.  Try the Arancini or Burrata, its more than enough for two people.  Cibo offers a modest  wine list at prices that  won't make you cringe  when you see them.    The serving sizes at Cibo are very generous, however that didn't stop us from ending the night with a fruit crepe which was more than enough for two people.   The service at Cibo is second to none. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and accommodating. If your looking for amazing food and service, stop by you won't be disappointed.

Stir Fry Done Right   At Mu Shu Asian Stir Fry you create your own stir-fry, and this is stir fry at its finest. First you choose from two types of rice or noodles,  mix in your choice of four diffrent sauces, select a protein (chicken, beef, pork, shrimp veggies). Then get ready to add some side dishes to compliment your entrée, such as spring rolls or pot stickers.  If you want to try something diffrent but absolutely delicious, order a Mu Shu Wrap. It's  a huge tortilla filled with your choice of protien,  fresh onions, carrots, scallions, cabbage, bamboo shoots and mu shu sauce, all stir fried in a sizzling hot wok. On today's visit, I had the Steak Mu Shu Wrap and it was delicious.   At Mu Shu Asian Grill you are served such a generous helping you will be able to eat this meal twice. The entrées are affordable, customer service is outstanding, and the food is delicious.  If your ever in the area give Mu Shu Asian Grill a try, you won't be disappointed.

Reasonable prices and fair quality, what more can you ask for.  I have to admit I'm not a huge fan of Ikea, however the prices at Ikea are reasonable, quality of products are fair, and the section is huge.  Ikea has everything you are looking for from furniture, kitchenware, bedding, and anything you could possibly need for your home.  Many people have referred to Ikea's style of furniture  as disposable, and I guess that compared to some items it would seem that way. However, I have purchased IKEA furniture for my Nephew's room and the furniture  has stood up to the test of time.  The furniture is easy to assemble, easy to care for, portable and stylish.  You could do worse in a pinch. As I mentioned Ikea might not.be my first choice but if I'm looking for something inexpensive and durable, Ikea is a good choice.

La Grande Orange - LGO - The Big O  LGO is one of the best places for breakfast in Phoenix.  Recently, I visited LGO for brunch and I am so glad I did. I have found a new favorite restaurant when I want to grab a pizza, sandwich, or delicious sweet treat.    You can't help from noticing the long line of patrons gathering for their morning fix at La Grande Orange, but don't let the crowd discourage you, LGO is worth the wait . Parking at LGO can be a challenge.  However, valet service is available.  LGO has a hip vibe with a café/local maket feel. The staff at LGO are very accommodating in helping you find exactly what your looking for.  Give yourself some extra time to browse while at LGO, there are various trinkets and goodies.  You'll find so many interesting gifts and items for yourself or a friend.    On this visit we started off with salads.  A Caesar and  a Caprese.  The salads were fresh, crispy,  and delicious. After our salads came the pie. We  ordered a cheese and sausage, all I can say is the pie was  devoured.  The crust was very crispy and very thin. Just cheese, tomatoes, sausage, and fresh basil.  Pure, simple deliciousness. All our food came out fast and hot, except for the salads, which were cold and crisp.  I also purchased a chocolate croissant, chocolate scone, and a bag of LGO's famous English muffins to go. LGO's English muffins are amazing, and are  everything an English muffin should be. LGO's English muffins are soft and toast up perfectly for buttering. I don't recall ever having had an equal.  If your ever in the area, you should stop by and give LGO a try, you won't be disappointed.

It doesn't get any better  I've had the opportunity of attending two Arizona Cardinals games at University of Phoenix Stadium.  All I have to say it is always a great experience.  I've been to a few stadium across the country and the Cardinals  have one of the better stadiums I've visited.  The Cardinals stadium has  comfortable seating, awesome views from anywhere, spacious walkways, lots and lots of amenities  (food, washrooms and a fan shop) and more then enough parking for tailgating.  Remember to get to the stadium early  before a game, so you can take advantage of all the great restaurants.  Don't forget statium personnel screen everyone coming in, and are strict with the NFL's new bag policies (ladies- get a wristlet or buy one of the clear tote bags).  So if you get a chance head to the stadium to check it out.

Maybe I ordered the wrong entrée    I absolutely love Mexican food, and have eaten at just about every Mexican restaurant in Metro Phoenix. I've read a number of reviews for Poco's Fiesta Del Sol, so I was excited to give it a try.   I want to start this review on a positive note.  The service at Poco's Fiesta Del Sol is amazing.  Once you are seated you're served a hot basket of chips and salsa and the salsa is delicious. I wish I could say the same about the rest of my meal.  On todays visit my lunch companion and I shared a chesse crisp, ground beef burrito with cream cheese, and a side of refried beans. The refried beans were dry and tasteless, the ground beef burrito with cream cheese  was very greasy and just didn't taste good.  I know some people seem to really like Poco's Fiesta Del Sol, but I'm just not one of them, maybe it was my entrée selection

Acacia Café   With its inexpensive prices, quick service it's no surprise that Acacia Café draws a crowd.  In addition to Acacia Café's inexpensive and generous servings, Acacia Café stands out for its cooking methods.  Everything is prepared fresh when your order. You might be in a rush, but the flavors and smells make you want to spend the day. It is not just the huge servings that are incredible, but the food is so delicious!   On my first visit I decided to go with breakfast (French toast).  Acacia Cafe gives Huge servings of thick cut French toast drizzled in syrup, covered in butter, and sprinkled with powered sugar.  The French toast is just crispy enough on the outside and tender and slightly moist inside, it just doesn't get any better.   If you love breakfast like I do, you have to Acacia Cafe!

What a workout  I had some out of town guest who are passionate about hiking and wanted to hike Piestewa Peak. I have climbed this peak several times and know just how challenging the hike can be, especially when the it is still in the 90's and in the middle of the day but we decided to give it a shot.  Piestewa is a great hike (workout), but worth it for its seneic beauty. Piestewa has a lot of steep, stair-like ups and downs that can be hard on the knees and ankles, so if you are expecting a hike up smooth paved trail, Piestewa may not be the hike for you.   If you decide to take the challenge, take water, lots of water and be up for the challenge, and enjoy the view!

GB always a good choice.    Gordon Biersch is always a good choice, especially after a day of shopping at Tanger Outlet Mall. GB has a relaxing atmosphere and I admire  the decor on the inside of the restaurant,  with all the subtle references to beer.  The server's at GB are always very helpful and take the time to review the menu and explain the various selection of beers offered. The menu at GB is large with a great selection of appetizers.  If you like fries, then you should sample the garlic fries. These fries are addictive, made with fresh pressed garlic, and pair nicely with  beer. If fries aren't for you, then the Blue Crab Artichoke Dip, or Ahi Tuna  is an absolutely must.  I enjoyed several of the Marzen Beers and we finished our meal with a delicious Warm Apple Bread Pudding. I look forward to my next visit to GB in the future. The prices are fair,  the menu is appealing, and the customer service is great.

Always a fun place.  I recognize that Buffalo Wild Wings is a chain and the food is probably similar from restaurant to restaurant. However,  I'm writing this review because of the excellent service we received at this restaurant.   Our server was helpful with showing us the specials, made suggestions on things that would go well together.  He kept our drink full and kept checking on us while we ate.  On this visit we ordered a number of plates to share - including 4 different types of wings - they were all very good - crispy with some nice sauces.  The Blazin sauce was my favorite.  At the end our server offered us a to go drink  and even gave us some extra sauce for our left over wings and told us to take our time, watch the tvs and just let him know if we needed anything else.    Great service will keep me coming back.

Not Just For Hunters   Cabela's has always been fun to go to, even the kids enjoy visiting Cabela's,  and why wouldn't they. Inside Cabela's is a manmade mountain with several stuffed game, and other layouts of stuffed game throughout the store. There is a small cafe and a fudge shop with a great selection of delicious fudge to choose from. You can even sample and flavor you want prior to purchasing   Cabela's offers the largest selection of outdoor sports items that I've ever seen under one roof. I can shop for camping gear, clothing, pet supplies, shooting accessories, and winter footwear all in he same place.  If your looking for anything related to outdoors Cabela's is  definitely worth a trip

Always Fresh and Delicious    The bagels are always fresh and delicious .  Great selection for both breakfast and lunch.  I'm a fan of the everything bagel with garden veggie schmere.  However,  I never pass up the pumpkin bagels with pumpkin schmere in the Fall.    Quick service, great selection, and a reasonable prices.

You have to try these cookies!  If you ever find yourself in the Phoenix area, craving a cookie, then look no more, Urban Cookies Bakeshop, is a must!   At Urban Cookies all of the amazing confections are made with fresh, local ingredients and the staff really seems to enjoy their jobs.  The shop might be called Urban Cookies, but its not only the cookies that are delicious, the cupcakes are simply amazing.   I couldnt decide between the double chocolate and sea salt or the dark chocolate and walnut cookies, so I got both and  they were both  outstanding    These cookies are fresh baked, very buttery, and most of all flavorable. There is a big difference tasting products made by hand from people who care, and Urban Cookies is one of those places.

Pet Friendly Airports   Many people consider their pets companions and the pets are part of the family, and my friends/ family  are no exception.  So,  I am  never surprised when my friends and family take their furry friends along with them on vacations.   Lately, I have had friends/family visit with thier furry friends from California.  Thank goodness Sky Harbor offers three areas for their furry friends to stretch their legs, drink water and take potty breaks (there are even mitts for cleaning up after your pet).   It's nice to see airports making it  easier to fly with pets.

Worth the Drive  I was always curious and wanted to stop by and see for myself why Butterfields Pancake House draws such a large crowd. After visiting Butterfields a few times I had my answer, the food is delicious. In fact, everything is delicious in this bustling, get em in, get em out, breakfast spot.  Anyone who has ever dined at Butterfields boast about the pancakes and for good reason. These pancakes are everything a pancake should be, light, fluffy, golden brown,  and very tasty.  Butterfields serves their pancakes with pure maple syrup and pancakes, come with most entrée's on the menu.  However, pancakes, arent the only entrees that taste great.  The other breakfast items Butterfields serves up are delicious as well. I really enjoyed the Santa Fe skillet. The chorizo is well seasoned but not overpowering, the onions & avocados are fresh, and the bed of hashbrowns are perfectly crispy.  My lunch companion decided to try  the "create your own omelette".  The omelette was large, fluffy, and filled with sausage, mushrooms, and cheese. My lunch companion said, it was the fluffiest and best tasting omelette he's had in a long time.  We both decided to order orange juice with our meal, which at Butterfields is fresh squeezed and delicious.   The servers are helpful and careful to accommodate your needs.  Butterfields is worth the wait.  I am  interested in going back to try their lunch fare.

I need to dine here more often.  I usually visit Wildflower Bread Company when I have an hankering for a unique and flavorful breakfast. With that being said, Wildflower Bread Company is always a reliable choice for a fast, reasonably priced breakfast or lunch.    Wildflower Bread Company offers a variety of items in a casual atmosphere. When you place your order you are assigned a number, you select your table, and your entrée is delivered to your table.  If you order a drink you self-serve while you wait.   The portions are generous, fresh,  and reasonable priced.  Wildflower offers a wide variety of menu items to suit everyone's taste preference. I enoy the French Toast, Pancakes, and Bran Muffins.   The staff is always helpful, friendly, and the restaurant is clean and well maintained. If your ever in the area you should stop by, you won't be disappointed.

Beautiful Scenery. .. Great Course  Palm Valley Golf Club  is a beuatiful, and well maintained golf that offers both an executive Lakes course, and full size Palm course.  Both courses are a lot of fun to play on, and each course  offer their own unique challenges.  Palm Valley Golf Club is one of the more affordable courses and defininitely worth a visit.  The staff at Palm Valley Golf Club are extremely friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable from the folks in the pro shop, to the servers in the clubhouse and everyone else in between.  So if your looking for a great course at a great price head out to Palm Valley Golf Club.  It's  a great way to spend a day.

Very Disappointed   When I take my vehicle to the carwash I go with the understanding that I am going to get a "sales pitch" for either an upgraded wash or a push to have my vehicle detailed.  On this occasion the sales pitch was for a vehicle detail.  I explained to the attendant that I did not want a detail at this time.  The sales associate spent several minutes explaining why I needed a detail, after I repeatedly stated I wasn't interested.  I understand the "sale pitch" what I don't appreciate is going beyond the "sales pitch" and becoming intrusive. I did however upgrade the carwash.  I have to admit I expected better service. The windows and side mirrors were not cleaned very well. The center console was not wiped down, nor were the rims, or the dashboard. I had to ask the attendant to clean those areas.  Overall my experience was less then favorable,  I won't be going back.

It's the small things that make a difference.  Costco is one of my favorite places to shop, for so many reasons.  The prices at Costco are competitive, and at times, you will discover that the prices at Costco are  lower then similar warehouses.   The quality of products at Costco are exceptional, other warehouses might find it challenging to compete. In addition to, quality products and competitive pricing, Costco has a large selection of food, clothing, electronics, movies,furniture, you name it, Costco probably has it.  All your shopping needs in one spot, it doesn't get any better.  Costco values their customers and takes "customer service" to the next level.  If you're at a  Costco warehouse and need to find a specific item the employees will walk you right to the item you are looking for, there is no pointing and being told, "It's over there".  It's the small things that make a difference

Over the counter medicines and so much more.   I went to Walgreens because my nephew was feeling a little under the weather and thought it would be good to stock up on some over the counter medicine.  When I arrived at the store I wasn't quite sure what medicine to give my nephew . The pharmacist could easily see I was confused and offered his assiatance.  After selecting some over the counter medicines I walked around the store and purchased juice, a few snacks, and even a "as seen on tv" item or two.  Walgreens is a great place to grab exactly what you need any time of the day of night and the staff is always friendly and helpful.

Disappointed   I've been wanting  to try G's food for a while now. I'm glad I went because I got it out of my system, but I won't be back. I guess I was expecting more because of all the positive reviews I had read. That's why I feel bad saying the food at G's is somewhat  bland and tasteless.   Basically, G's Food offers speciality hot dogs.  In addition, to a buffet style hot dog bar which is a great idea for a restaurant, Unfortunately, it is very poorly executed.   G's Food serves a mediocre hot dog at best. On out first vist we actually tried 3 different types of dogs. First, I ordered the Chicago Polish Dog and my lunch companion ordered the Ruben and Coney Dog.  The hot dogs and buns tasted somewhat stale. The food just wasn't very good. Although, G's offers numerous toppings from the buffet style bar, the items look and taste like they came straight from a can.   Not the worst dogs I've ever eaten but definitely a contender.

Pleasant Surprise    Recently, my father needed to find a place to stay for a lengthy time period and the Residence Inn Marriott is where he found himself.   Initally, after reading the two reviews on yelp I was concerned.  After spending time at the Residence Inn all my concerns fadded away. The staff couldn't be more friendly and helpful.  The studio suite, is extremely large, with queen-bed, large-screen tv and work desk. In addition, to a fully equipped bathroom, separate washstand and "wardrobe" area. There's a separate kitchen area  with cooking hobs, microwave oven, a full-size fridge-freezer. Basic crockery, cutlery and coooking utensils are supplied.   The fully equipped kitchen made cooking easy.  If you don't feel like cooking the Residence Inn offers a complimentary breakfast 7 days a week.  This is not the typical breakfast.   Residence Inn cooks up eggs,ham,sausage,potatoes,french toast, fruits,waffles, juice, coffee and the list goes on and on.  If dinner is more your thing the Residence Inn has a complimentary dinner Monday through Thursday with a changing menu.  Within the complex, there's also a shared pool and a clean, economical guests' laundry room.   Residence Inn is surrounded by great restaurants of varying expense levels and other attractions, overall a nice area. The Residence Inn feels more like an apartment or time share than a hotel. I highly recommend this hotel, they seriously care about your experience.

Wish I would have said thank you!   Remember when the day started with a hot cup of coffee and a hearty breakfast? At the Residence Inn, the good things never change.    On Saturday, I woke up early  to meet my father at the Residence Inn for breakfast.  The breakfast area was packed.  To be honest  I think everyone decided to eat at the same time.  I can understand why the complimentary breakfast at the Residence Inn is delicious. They have all the favorites like hot waffles, sausage and eggs, buttermilk biscuits and gravy, fresh fruit, pastries, oatmeal, muffins, hot and cold cereals, beagles, juice, milk and piping-hot coffee.   So as I sat I  let the aroma of fresh brewed coffee fill the air as I read the morning newspaper and prepared for the day's activities.    As I sat reading the paper what I failed to realize was the one person who made breakfast so enjoyable.  She was the cook, the greeter, the person who cleared the tables, and kept the food stocked.  Yes, one dedicated staff member did it all! I wish I would have thanked her ... for her dedication to provide excellent customer service. Not once did she not meet the needs of the guest and did it all with a smile.     I hope to see her again so I can say thank you!

The Kids Love This Place   I like Peter Piper Pizza because my nephew has so much fun.  But, overall the food is average at best and the service leaves something to be desired. Our large  pizza took over 35 minutes, and when I commented on the wait  to our server, she replied "...and we're not even busy"  The games all the same style for the most part. However, my nephew walked away with more then 1600 tickets, and he was thrilled.  The pizza is average but we will return simply because $20 buys a filling meal and an additional $20 buys my nephew an hour of fun.   There are a lot better pizza places (like Grimaldi's ) but I really don't go to Peter Piper for great pizza. We go to Peter Piper Pizza for games and fun. When I want a great pizza I head over to Grimaldi's.

A Consistent Favorite  Mimi's Cafe is one of those chain restaurans that is different enough and consistently good enough to recommend to family and friends.  All of the Mimi's Cafe Restaurants  are all exactly the same so you're immediately familair with the restruantat concept and their menu selections.     Mimi's Cafe serves breakfast, lunch and dinner and offer low calorie meals and a limited bar selection .  The prices are very reasonable with a two dinner meal including appetizer and dessert for $25.  The serving size are very generous.  In fact there was so much food we had to take two boxes to go.    The food is very fresh and plentiful.  The service is fast and pleasant with refills on drinks before we had to ask.  I would recommend Mimi's for a nice causal place to grab a bite to eat.

May Not Be The Fastest.... but they make a great Iced White Chocolate  Mocha  A nice start to the day    This Starbucks is not my usual stop however, it just might be my favorite. I love my coffee and what's better then a Starbucks iced white chocolate mocha, I can't think of anything and vanilla scone.  The service at this Starbucks might not be the fastest but it's still phenomenal and the staff are always very friendly. This location is clean, inviting, and feels comfortable and they have seating outside at the patio.  My coffee was made exactly the way I order and tasted great. In addition, to the great coffee Starbucks has delicious pastries if you need a snack. I really enjoy grabbing a cake pop or two to go.  Great coffee, pastries,  friendly staff, and shopping.

What to think?  I'm really not sure what to think of Oasis bed Factory.  This past weekend I was shopping for a mattress set and decidedto try oasis.    We were greated when we walked in the door.  The sales associate offered assistance but  we just wanted to spend some time looking around the store.    The Sales associates are helpful without being  intrusive.  Oasis has a large selection of mattresses but none of which I really thought were of high quality. The prices seem above average and the quality average at best.   I did not purchase anything from Oasis.  I guess I just really really wasn't impressed with what they had to offer

Stylish Savings  Who would have thought at the age of 12 you would be  concerned  with style and clothing. I now realize that clothes mean everything when you're a teenage, boy or girl.   Fortunately, today there are a lot of options for teens. There are so many popular stores that cater to a younger demographic making it easy to find clothes.  Over the weekend, I took my nephew clothes shopping.  I mentioned about a dozen different stores, all of which  he responded with a head nod.  My nephew asked if we could go to Tilly's.  I have never heard of Tilly's, but thought it was worth a try.    I was pleasantly surprised as we walked into.  Tilly's offers men's clothing, women's clothing, kids' clothing, backpacks, shoes and accessories from all the popular brands.  The staff at Tillys  is helpful, accommodating, and they take their time helping you find exactly what you are looking for.  The prices are reasonable and a selection is large.   If your looking for the "in" clothes, give Tillys a try.

Famous Footwear .. Great prices and a huge selection of shoes.   Famous Footwear is a large store with an even bigger selection of shoes. You always get a warm welcome as you enter the store, but more importantly Famous Footwear has excellent customer service, and I dont mean the  typical   "Hello can I help you?". The staff at Famous Footwear are willing to take the time to actually find out which shoe is most suitable, which makes for  a great  shopping experience.   Famous Footwear  rewards loyal customers with a discounts and the buy one get one half price is a great savings . The quality of merchandise and customer service  is absolutely unrivalled. You have to check this store out if you ever need some shoes.

I guess sometimes you have to take the good with the bad.  I have to admit I am not a fan of the Walmart stores.  However, Walmart has competitive pricing.  So with that being said, if I absolutely have to go to Walmart for something I will, but other than that I usually choose to stay away.  I seems like some items at Walmart aren't very clean, and Walmart at times, gives the appearance of being unorganized.  Walmart has over 20 registers. However, I seem to shop on the days when only 4 registers are open which makes getting through the checkout line challenging, it is very frustrating.   On a good note I have noticed some  improvements, and you can't beat Walmart  prices on many items and I price match all the time instead of going to 4 different stores.   I guess sometimes you have to take the good with the bad.

I won't be going back anytime soon.  We have ordered from Papa John's numerous times in the past and they generally do an OK job. However, my last few visits to Papa John's the customer service has been poor and the pizza has been cold,soggy, and inedible.  On this particular occasion I placed a phone order to be picked up at 4pm. I thought 50% off, can't go wrong with that. So I ordered pizza for everyone.   1 large thin crust pepperoni, sausage, and bacon.  2  medium original crust pepperoni pizzas.    I Arrived at the store at 403.  The store was empty but the empoyees were busy. I waited by the front counter even tho several employees looked at me not one acknowledged I was there for 5 minutes.  Finally,  a employee came up to the counter and assisted me.   As a I paid for my order and grabbed my pizzas I noticed that the top boxes were hot but the bottom box was cold.  I asked the cashier if the pizza was sitting out very long and she replied " I'm not sure but I don't think so". I opened the cold box of pizza and the pizza looked unappetizing and old.  The employee offered to make a pizza replacement.   So I was left with the decision to wait 15 minutes for one new pizza and allow the two other pizzas to get cold.  So I  made the decission and waited. Once my pizza was ready I headed home.  The large pizza was good the two pepperoni pizza were absolutely terrible.  The pizza were now cold, soggy , and once again unappetizing.  No one ate the pizza and they went straight to the trash.    There are a variety of pizza restaurants in my neighborhood and even though they do not offer 50 percent off. I still consider them a better option. I won't be going back to Papa Johns anytime soon.

My last visit  Placed a "to go" order 3 small pizzas, 2 with pepperoni and 1 with pepperoni and sausage, all with Asiago flavored crust. I walked in to Hungry Howies to pick up my order and the restaurant was empty.  However, it still took over 5 minutes for an employee to acknowledge I was there and  to get my order.   The pizza honestly was one of the worst take-out pizzas I have ever had from Hungry Howies and the order wasn't even correct. I wish I would have looked at my order prior to leaving the store.  I called Hungry Howies to let them know that not only was the pizza not very good but my order wasn't correct.  The associate who answered the phone response was "Sorry bout that, not sure who cooked it.  I guess we can cook another".  After waiting another 20 minutes to cook another pizza I head back up to Hungry Howies and yes, once again my order wasn't correct (wrong flavor crust). Since I wasn't willing to wait another 20 minutes I took the pizza and headed home.  My previous experiences with Hungry Howies has always been hit or miss. I think I will drive a little further to one of the many other pizza places in my area.

The premade Boars Head sandwiches at the deli are delicious. To be honest I was pleasantly surprised.  In fact, that sandwich was one of the best I've had in a long time.  In addition to great sandwiches I usually can find everything that I need with no problems. The sales associates are very polite, friendly, and helpful.  The prices at Fry's are competitive in comparison with other grocery stores in the area.   I like the deli section at the Fry's supermarket they serve Boars Head sandwich meats which happens to be one of my favorites.  The Deli  service can be slow at times but is worth the wait. If you ever need a six foot sub Fry's has a really nice selection to choose from and they all are delicious and reasonably priced

Well-lit, spacious feeling room, lots of exercise equipment,  modern changing rooms, large lockers, and a large variety of classes at various times.  Everything about the YMCA is exceptional. The pools are fantastic, the workout equipment top of the line. There are plenty of cardio equipment (I have never have to wait for a machine).   Everything you could want in a gym. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Membership is reasonable and  worth the price.

A nice start to the day    This Starbucks is not my usual stop however, it just might be my favorite. I love my coffee and what's better then a Starbucks iced white chocolate mocha, I can't think of anything and vanilla scone.  The service at this Starbucks is phenomenal and the staff are always very friendly. This location is clean, inviting, and feels comfortable and they have seating outside at the patio, and wuth this cooler weather what a perfect option.  My coffee was made exactly the way I order and tasted great. In addition, to the great coffee Starbucks has delicious pastries if you need a snack. I really enjoy grabbing a cake pop or two to go.  Great coffee, pastries,  friendly staff, and shopping.  It doesn't get any better.

Great Wash  I was planning on selling my car however,  I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a detail, so I decided to get the Ultra Wash and I'm sure glad that I did.   My nephew and his friends  had been riding in my car and there were spilled cherry icees, french fry grease stains and numerous other stains that I thought would never come out. The folks at Superstar took such great care and attention to detail. When I got my car back, it was beautiful and looked just like it did when I first bought my car.   I was extremely pleased and surprised. It was obvious Superstar takes pride in their work. Even the dealership mentioned how great my car looked when I went to trade it in.  I'm definitely coming back to Superstar with my new vehicle.

Just not good.  I was in a rush to grab a bite to eat, and had very little time, so Jack in the Box it was.  I ordered a three piece eggroll and soft drink. I was handed a cup for my soft drink and headed over to the drink despencer, when the employee working behind the  called out "three piece eggroll". I grabbed my order and headed to a table.  When I opened the box of eggrolls it  appeared brunt, old, and were cold.  I went back to the counter and showed the employee working.  She asked if want a new order and I stated yes.    The new order was fresh however they weren't terribly good after the first few bites, and I threw the rest of the eggrolls away.  Overall, I understand Jack in the Box,  is fast food, and that is what you receive and on occassion it's a good place for a bite to eat.  However, this location I would not choose to eat at very often.

It has been a while but I'm back now.  I use to shop at JC Penny often but stopped when the sales started decreasing. I'm happy to say the sales are back and so am I.   I thoroughly enjoy the shopping process (both offline and online) at JCPenney.  The in-store customer service reps are  incredibly helpful, and I find the online shopping experience easy  to navigate and I usually find exactly what I am looking for. It's not always easy to find a retail experience online that makes you feel confident and secure with uour purchases as JCPenney's does.   If you haven't been to JC Penny in a while  I would recommend you visit the stire or online.

If you build it they will come.  Westgate Entertainment District is a  great place to come, relax and enjoy hanging out.  Westgate offers a variety of dining establishments and refreshments as you stroll around the district enjoying the sights and sounds.   There is so much to do at Westgate Entertainment District. I really enjoy sitting in front of the waterfalls and watching the water fountains that are synchronized to music. My nephew likes the splash pad especially on those hot summer days.  Westgate has a AMC movie theater, large variety of restaurants, arts &crafts,  and specialty shops to choose from, and did I mention the Tanger Outlets are right across the street within walking distance.  If you have some time to spare; Westgate  is a great place to do it.

Great service, arrived at 8 am due to an eye infection.  I wasn't sure how long I would have to wait, we all know how busy urgent care can be.  I signed in and was called back within in 10 minutes.  After taking my vitals I went into a patient room and the doctor arrived a few minutes later.  I was given my prescription and discharge instructions and was out the door by 840, not a bad deal for urgent care on a saturday.  The staff is friendly and helpful and doctors can address any concerns you have.  When your primary care physician isn't available this is the place to go.

Bertha's is the Best!   Bertha's is a locally owned breakfast lunch spot and without question, Bertha's is a gem.  The food is always fresh, delicious, service is quick, and the staff always has a smile.   If you have a chance to stop by Bertha's  don't be discouraged by the strip mall location, because  Bertha's makes up for their location with excellent food. There is a nice sitting area outside weather permitting and plenty of seating inside.    Bertha's baked goods are fantastic. You even get a small chocolate cookie if you order a sandwich. I have to say Bertha's cookies are fantastic. You won't find better cookies anywhere this side of your mother's kitchen. I had the club sandwich/fruit salad and it was delicious, the sandwich was loaded with turkey, ham, cheese, and all the fixins. The fruit salad was good, but Bertha's puts lemon juice on their apples and I think I'd prefer my apples just like they are.  If you get a chance stop by Bertha's doesn't disappoint

To Serve or Not Serve   Hello Yelpers   Recently,  I had a experience at a Golden Corral Restaurant that concerned me enough to write to their corporate office not once but twice.  After receiving "no response" I thought I might as well add this to my " Yelp" reviews".  I believe it's incumbent upon management to put things right for any and all concerns a guest may have while dining at their establishment. I have never experienced Management at a corporate level fail to respond in a timely manner when a guest addressed a concern. With the vast amount of establishments to dine at one would think that the last thing management at any restaurant would want is to have a guest  leave unhappy or, in my case to never come back again.  Rather then writing a strategic rant, I have decided to attach the letter I sent to corporate headquarters.    September 23, 2013   Corporate Office of Golden Corral   I am writing this letter to discuss a recent experience I had at your Golden Corral restaurant located at 420 N Dysart Rd, Goodyear, Arizona (623) 925-9075.  I have visited this location many times and have always enjoyed the quality of food and superior service.  However, my latest visit to Golden Corral has me very concerned as a guest.     On Saturday, September 21 around 1130 A.M. I visited your restaurant to purchase a dozen rolls for a BBQ I was having later that day.  When I returned home and opened the box of rolls I noticed that the rolls were hard and somewhat overcooked.  I realize this has happened to us all at one time or another. Each of us has ordered food at a restaurant and gotten something that differs from our expectations to some degree. I appreciate that restaurant work is a very challenging business, and sometimes cooks and chefs can get caught up in a multitude of orders, all at the same time and the quality of a product can suffer.  I usually do not return food but I really wanted to serve the rolls at the BBQ so I went back to have the rolls replaced.   I arrived at the restaurant around 1:25 p.m and asked to speak with a manager (whose name I do not recall).  To be fair, the manager came over apologized and he offered a replacement dozen of rolls fresh out of the oven and advised it would be about 6 minutes. That was nice; my concern lies in the statement the manager made after he took the dozen rolls I brought back.  The manager asked if I had "touched the rolls" because if I had not touched the rolls they could be used to make "bread pudding".  At that moment I wanted to leave the restaurant and I would have left had the replacement rolls not came fresh out of the oven. My concern lies in the area of food, health, and safety issues.  Is taking returned food from guest and reusing it standard operating procedure for Golden Corral?   I am not an expert by any means in the area of food preparation.  However, I do realize that food safety is a scientific discipline and the proper handling, preparation, and storage of food is the only way  to prevent foodborne illness. Food can transmit disease from person to person and standard precautions should always be adhered to.  When you are a guest at any food establishment your thought is; the food ought to be safe, and the preparation of the food should be such as to avoid potentially severe health hazards, such as taking returned food from a guest and reusing that product.   I am not sure if I will ever revisit Golden Coral again but I know without a doubt that  I will never go back to your Avondale location.  The thought of reusing food that a guest returned is enough to keep me from coming back to that location.   Thanks  Dxxxx Gxxxxxxx  1xxxx W Xxxxxxxxx Ave  Xxxxxxxx,  Arizona  xxx-xxx-xxxx

I am a fan of Chiense Cuisine, in fact Chiense food is one of my favorites. We might not have a Chinatown in this city, however, that doesn't mean we don't have delicious and authentic Chinese food in Arizona.  The entrée's at China Grill are absolutely delicious.  Without a doubt, one of the best meals that I  have had in a Chinese restaurant.  You won't find stodgy batter, or red dye stained food at China Grill, what you will find is fresh, tasty, made to order delicious meals.  On my first visit I went with the Honey chicken, fried rice, egg drop soup, and eggroll. The Honey Chicken was crispy, plump fresh white meat chicken, perfectly seasoned not drowned in sauce. The Honey chicken was probably some of the best honey chicken I have had. The eggroll were crispy, full of flavorful vegetables, and the rice was cooked perfectly.  When I finished my meal and pushed my plates away, my check was brought out immediately, along with take-out containers for my leftovers.  a perfect meal, great service, and delicious food.  I'll be going back very soon.

I Just ... Like This Place Alot.  Ground Control is not like any other coffee house but then again Ground Control is much more then a coffee house.  Ground Control has a relaxed feel and the food and service have always been excellent. Ground Control offers  daily and weekly specials at a very reasonable price.  On my very first visit to Ground Control I was drawn to the  Gelato case.  I have to admit next to a good Italian ice Gelato is my second sweet tooth weakness.  I will not  claim to be a Gelato expert, however, I have tatsed many Gelato's and I can say in  confidence that Ground Controls Gelato is the real deal, this  gelato is  very good.  I always struggle choosing between the lemon or blood orange (blood orange usually wins).   I wish I could say that  I have tried many items off the menu but that just isn't the case.  The reason why I haven't explored more items off the menu is because I am addicted to the  pizza, which is cooked in a wood fired oven.  The pizza at Ground Control is excellent. Try the B-B-Q it's delicious (get a side order of garlic parm fries, very tasty)  The wine and beer lists are likewise excellent. Ground Control is an ideal place to visit for a leisurely and inviting meal.

Chicago Gyros in Phoenix Arizona  Chicago Gyros is a clean, pleasant, establishment with a professional friendly staff.  Today, was my first visit to Chicago Gyro, however, it won't be my last.  On this visit I had the Philly Gyro with Fries.  The fries were piping hot, crispy, well seasoned, and fresh.  I wasn't planing on eating all the fries, however, I did , the fries were delicious.  My Philly Gyro was equally goox.  The Pita was soft, fresh, and hot, and the serving of Gyros was more then generous. The beef was moist, as if it had just been shaved onto the pita.  I enjoyed the onions and peppers, which were on the sweet side, and not too strong to enjoy.   The portions are generous, the prices are fair, and the customer service is great. If your ever in the area, you should give Chicago Gyros a try.

Good Sandwich's at a Fair Price  From the moment you walk in the door at the Honeybaked Ham Company Cafe you are greeted with friendly smiles. I have stopped in for a quick sandwich on several occasions and have always had a good experience. The Honeybaked Ham Company Cafe offers good sandwiches at a fair price.  Thr cafe is small however, the Honey Baked Ham has  a wonderful selection of sandwiches. The most challenging  part of your visit  is selecting a sandwich. There's the stacker, tavern club, ham salad, and my favorite the chicken salad which is always a good lunch choice.  If your looking for a quick bite to eat, stop by the Honeybaked Ham Company Cafe  the food is always good and the staff is friendly and helpful.

Great location  I have to admit I usually visit Harkins theaters becuase Harkins is closer to home and I have a lot of Harkins Movie passes.  However, I was at  the Westgate Entertainment District and wanted to catch a movie.   I was impressed with the layout of the theater, this theater is really spacious.   The lobby, restrooms, and theater were spotless. The concession stand had a good selection of goodies and a self serve  Coca-Cola Freestyle touch screen soda fountain. I appreciate  having a selection of different Coca-Cola products to choose from  and being able to add custom flavors is a nice bonus.  The theater seats are roomy, the sound and picture quality were excellent. I'd definitely recommend visiting this AMC thrater.

Worth A Visit    My nephew and I stumbled accross Johnny Rockets after spending the day at Westcourt, and I am so glad we did.   The food was really good especially for the price, the shakes were unbelieveable and the service was second to none. Our server (Beth) went out of her way to make sure our food was exactly as we wanted and that my nephew was having a great time.  Our drinks were constantly full and Beth made sure we had everything we needed or wanted.  I would truly reccomend Johnny Rockets to everyone. If you want good food at a reasonable price in the Westcourt area, give Johnny Rockets a try.

Jason's Deli ... Good place for a salad and sandwich   I have visited a few of the  Jason's Deli's around town, and have never had a bad expeirence. Every visit to any of Jason's Deli restaurants has always been a positive experience.   I cannot seem to stop myself from ordering the fruit platter every time I visit Jason's. The fruit is always fresh and the fruit dip is delicious.   I always want to try something new but always  get caught up ordering the fruit platter. The sandwiches are always fresh and tasty.  The staff at Jason's Deli is friendly, accommodating,  and the service is always quick.  Jason's Deli has a large drink selection, and you get a complimentary soft-serve ice cream cone with your meal.  Can you think of a better way to finish a meal?  If you haven't visited Jason's Deli, you should stop by, you won't be disappointed.

Experience the difference.  It's official, Tomo Japanese Cuisine is my favorite sushi restaurant in the Phoenix Metro area, and I have frequented many sushi establishments on my quest for deliciously fresh sushi.  Today, my friends and I stopped by Tomo Japanese for dinner, and I must admit the atmosphere and sushi did not disappoint. Tomo Japanese is clean, the staff is very friendly, acomadating, and the food is fresh and delicious.  We sampled different types of sushi, and sushi rolls, all of which were fresh  quality cuts. All our entrée's were  creatively crafted, and very reasonably priced, particularly at happy hour.   Tomo Japanese offers generous portions, enough for two but you will want to finish your entrée all yourself.  I highly recommend the Tuna Sashimi, Salmon, or Dragon Roll sushi all are absolutely delicious.    So if you happen to find yourself in the area and have a  hankering for delicious Sushi, then stop in and feast on delicious food served by some very nice people.

Always purchase more then I attended.   I shop at Sprouts Farmers Market occasionally for seasonal or specialty items, but always walk out with more than I intended to purchase.   Sprouts offers  a variety of specialty products, and  has a wide selection of everday grocery needs. The prices at Sprouts are competitive to what you would pay at your local chain grocery store. What I like most about Sprouts is their selection of organic, and gluten-free items.    I am always impressed by the freshness and quality of the produce department. As well as the meat and deli departments. I also like the prepared foods department, it's hard to resist when you go by.  The staff at Sprouts  are all very friendly, and more then happy to  help you find what you are looking for.

What Happens When New York ... Meets Arizona?? You Get Chompies!    Chompies  has the old New York style ambiance and the food to match. The portions are large, really large, these portions are big enough for two. So bring a big appetite.  Chompies serves all the authentic deli sandwiches, soups, salads, bagels, breads and desserts.   I've  been to Chompie's several times and have never been disappointed. Service has always been very attentive and the sandwiches are incredible. The  Pastrami and Corned Beef are perfectly lean, piled high,and oh so tender. If you make it to Chompies you have to try the Original  Jewish sliders.  These sliders are incredible. Moist lean brisket, piled high on challah roll, a mini potato pancake on the bottom,  with jack cheese, served with a side of hot brown dipping  gravy. This slider couldn't be any better.   The soups are wonderful, especially the matzo ball. The pastry counter is endless, you have to try the black and white cookie  Chompie's is a must for breakfast or lunch if your in the area!

Hit or Miss  Sometimes you have a craving for a certain food but you really don't want to take the time and trouble to get dressed up or sit in a restaurant so that's when you go for take out.   Tonight I had a craving for Chinese, and  I wanted someplace close.  So Panda Express it was. As I waited in line I noticed that many of the selections were in short supply and two of the advertised "specials" were completely empty.  I assumed that the cook was in the process of refilling the empty trays. However, I was wrong.  When it was my turn, I was advised that it would be several minutes before new entrees would be ready, so I was limited to what was on hand.  To be honest I  did not find the food to be very tasty, certainly not even good fast food Chinese.   So this is my conclusion of Panda Express.  No, the quality and taste is not that of P.F. Chang but you could do worse in a pinch.  I satisfied my craving for Chiense while watching my favorite television shows. Sometimes, it's all about choices.

Give a Shout out   This was my first time at the Shout House and I have to admit I had a really good time.  The food choices at The Shout House consist of the typical "bar type" food and are fairly limited. However, the food is good if you just want to sit and nibble at a leisurely pace, while drinking your beverage of choice.  The main attraction at the Shout House  are the two Baby Grand Pianos which are back to back on the stage. There are two large mirrors suspended behind the pianos which allows you to  see the performers and the crowd.     On the tables there  are  forms and pencils for you to write your song requests . The repertoire of songs being played covers a large variety of music preferences and it's' great to hear the crowd sing along with songs of the past and present.  I've been to a few dual piano bars however,  the pianists at the Shout  House are truly gifted.  The pianist exchanged jokes and comments, and involved the crowd.  They were very entertaining.   The wait-staff at the Shout House are excellent, being attentive but not intrusive while breaking off periodically to contribute to the entertainment and engage customers.   So if your looking for a leisurely night out, stop by the Shout House, you won't be disappointed.

Where's the Beach  I really enjoy the atmosphere at Island Restaurant.  The decor makes you feel as if you just strolled in off the beach.  In addition, to the relaxing atmosphere, the food at Island Restaurant is really good and of high quality.    One of my favorites is the Maui Burger.  The Maui burger is absolutely  delicious. In fact, all the burger at Island Restaurant are delicious, large, and loaded with your favorite toppings.    Even the children's portions are large at Island Restaurant.  My nelhew enjoys the mini slider, cheeseburger and hot dog with seasoned  island fries.  Island Restaurant is a fun place to take the family out to eat.  The prices are reasonable, the service is great, and the food is delicious.

Where a Kid Can Be a Kid   I really like the Phoenix Children's Museum. I first found the childrens museum about three years ago and have been going ever since and it is always a great time.   My nephew enjoyed the museum  so much and never wants to leave. There are lots of great activities and places to explore.   One of my nephew's  favorite activities  is the noodle forest on the second floor. My nephew could spends hours in the noodle forest.  One of  my favorite room is the grocery store room, it's just so much fun.    I highly recommend the Phoenix Childrens Museum to anyone with kids from  8 months to 10  years old.  The museum  is well worth the price for a day of fun with the kids! Especially in the summer time when it's too hot to play outside.

I hate to give a restaurant a less than favorable review especially when the the majority of reviews have been positive. However,the food at Beijing Chinese Restaurant just wasn't that good.  What I first noticed as I walked into Beijing restaurant was how uncomfortably hot it was inside.  It felt as if the air conditioning was turned off.  I was glad I had placed a take out order.  The restaurant was empty but it still took several minutes for someone to help me.  The staff wasn't very friendly but maybe it was due to how uncomfortable it was inside.  On my first visit to Beijing I ordered 2 Seasme chicken lunch specials and an order of Beef Chow Fun.  The noodles and the beef in the Beef Chow Fun were greasy and tasteless.  The noodles were stuck together in a pile. The spring rolls were cooked nicely but just did not have a nice taste the same could be said about the crab puff. The Seasme chicken wasn't great but it wasn't the worse I have had.  I could not give Beijing Chinese a positive review but in a  pinch you could do worse.

Who knew a little restaurant inside a grocery store would be so good.   Food City is a great everyday low price supermarket. Food city is  like every modern supermarket that offers full service meat department, pharmacy items, baked sweets, picnic supplies and a full line of groceries.   However,  what the other markets cant offer and food city can is a quality line of authentic mexican foods. Food city is where I go to get my homemade tortillas, tortilla chips, and fresh made salsas.       As soon as you walk through the doors of Food City you know this is not the  normal grocery store.  You  feel like you entered a new world.  There is  mexican music playing through out the store, smells of mexican food, mexican baked goods, and authentic Agua Fresca in large glass jars.   Tucked in the corner of Food City, is a huge tortilla-making machine. The smell of fresh tortilla in the morning draws you in and you can't avoid the temptation to purchase a few dozen fresh and hot off the press.   The food is excellent. Everything is reasonably priced & the portions are big enough that you will take home leftovers. I had a breakfast burrito for just $3.49, and it was big!  I have aslo had their pollo asado deal which included a full grilled chicken, rice, beans, salsa and 20 corn tortillas and it was also delicious.

Always Fresh and Delicious   I have always enjoyed eating at Pita Jungle, the service is exceptional and you always leave pita jungle wanting more.   The serving sizes are very generous and you will find yourself having to take home leftovers. Today, my friends and I ordered the hummus trio for an appetizer, and we split a few chicken pita wraps. If you like hummus at all, you need to try the Cilantro Jalapeño hummus, and the Roasted Red Pepper Hummus they are delicious. If hummus isn't for you Pita Jungle offers a wide variety of menu selections. There are quite a few salads ("Sizzling", or "Cold"), healthy burgers (Black Bean, Portobello Mushroom or Broiled Fish) and Wood Fired Pizzas.   The service is always friendly, courteous, and the food is always fresh and delicious. So if your ever in the area give Pita Jungle a try

Wasn't sure what to expect when we went to Shane's Rib Shack, inside is plain with no frills. The food at Shane's Rib Shack was average at best. I  didn't taste like the baby back ribs.  The ribs tasted liked they popped out of a frozen package and baked.  Shane's offers four BBQ sauces plus Carolina vinegar available at the condiment table. My take out order was prepared in  10 minutes. On this visit we order a full slab of baby back ribs and Mac and Cheese.  The Mac was okay. It was cheesy but dry instead of creamy. As for the ribs they weren't so good. The ribs were dry and on the fatty side. The ribs just didn't taste good, I was very disappointed.  Very doubtful I will revisit Shane's again but I like to think the pit master had a bad day.

Not what I expected   We were looking for a casual place to grab a quick lunch. After reading a few reviews, we decide to give Native Grill a try.   Native Grill is your basic "sports bar".  It's is a nice size bar, with plenty of TV's.   Native Grill offers various wing styles and flavors. On this visit we tried lunch special, burger and fries.  I didn't particularly care for the burger or fries. The bjrger was slightly overcooked and somewhat dry and the fries were slightly undercoomed.  Our server was polite and accommodating without being intrusive, and the service was good. I just wish the food was better.

A great pie   I'm originally from NY, and it's always a challenge to find a great NY style Italian Pie. I have eaten lots of pies at  Grimaldi's original location under the Brooklyn Bridge, and I have  to say this Grimaldi's has equally great pies.  We arrived at 11:00 after watching a movie and we were seated within minutes. Our server took our drink order, and the drinks were delivered quickly. On this visit we kept it simple, a small pepperoni, double cheese pizza.  The small pizza is enough for two people (16"). The  pizzas are thin crust, crispy, and  delicious.  We were filled from our pizza, but  we couldn't pass up desert. So  we went with  the "trio" for desert.  You pick any three deserts off the menu. We tried the Tiramisu, Oreo cookie cheesecake, and Cannoli. My favorites was the cannoli. Grimaldi's has great food, service, and staff, which always keepd me coming back.

A little disappointed.  I am a creature of habit and usually find myself at total Wine over  BevMo.  I was somewhat disappointed in the selection and size of this BevMo  store.  This particular location appears to me much smaller then other BevMo's I have fequented and does not have as lage selection as other BevMos's.  The staff at BevMo were very friendly but not very familiar or knowledgeable about the products they carry.

Something for Everyone  I've been to a handful of BJ's Restaurants and have never been disappointed with my dining experience. However, the BJ's Restraunt and Brewery in Peoria is my favorite.  BJ's has high ceilings, long bars, mix of tables and booths, and large flat screne TV's within viewing distance of all. I can honestly say, I truly enjoy the ambiance at BJ's.  The menu at BJ's is varried, offering a large selection of beers, cocktails, and entrée's, there is something for everyone at BJ's. If you can't find something at BJ's to eat,  then you don't like to eat.   The burgers at BJ's are delicious and one of my favorite entrée's, but if burgers are not your thing, BJ's offers plenty of other options.  The Thyme-Lemon Chicken and Steaks are amazing and grilled to perfection, with a  a bit of char, tender, and so flavorful.  Service is reliable and well-timed. The staff is very accomdating without being intrusive.  Table or bar seating are all good and their to-go service works well, too.  If your looking for a nice dining expeirence give BJ's Restraunt and Brewery a try, you won't be disappointed.

A small store that has a lot to offer.   Fresh and Easy is  smaller than your average supermarket.  However, I appreciate this smaller store that packs a punch.  Fresh and Easy might not have all the items I am looking for but Fresh and Easy offers items that you will not find in the other supermarkets.   Fresh and Easy offers fresh not frozen pre made meals and these meals are really tasty.  In addtion, to the great taste most of the house-packaged foods are free of trans fats, artificial colors, flavors, and preservatives.  It's refreshing to have pre-made meals that aren't loaded with chemicals like so many other pretty made meals found on grocers shelves.  Chemical free is definitely a step in the right direction, making it easier for people to make, healthier foods choices.

Always a good purchasing experience   I have to admit I have always enjoyed shopping at Best Buy.  The prices are competitive, and the employees are knowledgeable.  The sales associates offer their assistance,  and offer suggestions without being intrusive.  I never feel pressure to purchase and I can look at and test the electronics   Outstanding customer service & knowledgeable staff keep me coming back.

It's usually a hit or miss.  I have to admit I love my coffee and I always stop at a Starbucks store when I have a hankering. There are many Starbucks locations and the service and coffee is usually great when you visit your local Starbucks.  However, this location, in my expeirence, has always been hit or miss.    There are those times when the service is great and so is the coffee.  However, more often the service is lacking as well as their coffee.   I usually perfer Starbucks over their  competitors because my coffee is always made the way I order and tastes great. I will continue to go to Starbucks but probably avoid this location.

You Have to try this place it simply amazing. You won't get hard chunks of  ice like most snowballs. These snowballs are powder soft and bursting with flavor. Sweet cold and refreshing.   Jeff the owner is a super nice guy who is determined to find a flavor you will love, There are 53 flavors to choose from and I plan on making my way through the list!

The Wow Factor!  Have you ever had one of those dining experiences that just makes your whole day? Where the server's are so personable that you just want to invite them to sit with you? If you haven't then head on over to the District American Kitchen and Wine Bar and expeirence it for yourself.  The District American Kitchen and Wine Bar is so amazing that I actually went two nights in a row. The staff at the District are great and the food is amazing.  I especially enjoyed the Brisket Tacos, Sloppy Joe Sliders , and Macaroni and Cheese.  In addition, to amazing food the District has a great selection of local craft beers.  In fact, I ended up buying and refilling a growler.    The restaurant is spacious, clean,  trendy and has a large bar area to relax and unwind. Just when I thought my dining experience couldn't get any better.  Megan gave us  free cotton candy (grape) after our meal. I honestly couldn't remember the last time I had cotton candy.   Meagan, Jeff, and Noah - You're the best! This was a superb dining experience, Thank You.

Better then you might think.  Tortas Paquime is clean, busy and has great food. The entrée's at Torta Paquime are reasonably priced, made fresh to order, and absolutely delicious.   The carnitas  and ribeye tacos are some of the best I've had anywhere and the tortas are not only delicious but are enormous as well. So be prepared to go hungry and have leftovers. Make sure you ask for a side of the pickled onions, jalapenos and carrots (they're free).    You never walk away from Tortas Paquime hungry but leave some room for a dessert because the ice cream and pastries will satisfy your sweet tooth.  Great service and excellent food, it doesn't get any better.

Downtown Hipsters   I spend quite a bit of time in the downtown Phoenix area and have passed by the Side Bar many times in my travels.  I had always been curious about this little downtown establishment but never stopped by to check it out.  However, that was all about to change.  Recently, I had out of town guests who wanted to visit the downtown area and I thought the Side Bar might be a good place to relax, and have some fun, I was absolutely correct.  The Side Bar has a relaxed hip vibe with their hardwood floors, brick walls, and plush seating.  Displayed on the walls are works by local artists, and old silent movies playing on the big screen.  The Side Bar has a extensive selection of different types of beers, wines and hand-crafted cocktails. The Side Bar even squeezes its own fresh juices daily. All I have to say is, fresh squeezed juice makes for amazing tasting drinks.  We had a fantastic time at the Side Bar and meet very diverse and interesting groups of people sitting at the bar and the clientele gets more interesting as the night goes on.   SideBar is the perfect place to stop for a drink, relax, and chat with friends. If you haven't been to the Side Bar stop by, you won't be disappointed.

I've tasted plenty of tamales always searching for a great tasting one because I don't know how to make tamales myself. I almost gave up looking for a good tasting tamale's that  is until I came across "The Tamale Store", what a great find!!!!!! Every bite was soooo goooood"! The taste couldn't get any better. These tamales are everything a great tamale should be: soft, moist, corny, and packed full of great tasting ingredients. There's no skimping on these tamale's what a selection to choose from, the Tamale Store offers meat, vegan, vegetarian, and sweet tamales. You have to try the chicken with green chili, rice and cheese, incredible!!!!

Louisiana meets Arizona  My friends and I are always on the lookout for non-chain restaurants in the West Valley. After reading fellow "yelpers" reviews, we decided to give Flavors of Louisiana a shot and I am so glad we did. Flavors of Louisiana got it right. Fresh food, flavorful ingredients, large portions, modest prices, excellent cutomer service and  easy access parking out front.  Flavors of Louisiana has a  laid back casual atmosphere.  As you walk in you see the front cashier where you order your food.  On the walls are some LSU teeshirts and logos , a bayou mural on another wall, and smiling and helpful staff.   On our first visit we shared, catfish Po-Boy, hush puppies, shrimp, fresh bread, and Boudin Balls. Everything was perfectly breaded and fresh. We also had sides of the Red Beans and Rice (highly recommend) as well as cole slaw which was also very good. Flavors of Louisiana offers great food for the money! (each sandwhich & side are about $10 for the 6").  If you ever in the area you should give flavors of Louisiana a try. You won't be disappointed.

Get a dozen to go.   If you like fresh bagels, then Einstein's  is where you go. Einstein's has a nice variety of beagles, and breakfast & lunch sandwiches are good as well.   I enjoy getting a box of bagels to go & making sandwiches with them at home.    So if your in the mood for a bagel stop by Einstein's.

Hooked on the Eggrolls.  I have driven by King Egg Roll dozens of times, not realizing it was a Pho restaurant.  The name that is visible from the street is simply "King Egg Roll" and I assumed it was aChinese restaurant.  When we drove up and parked, we realized that it was Vietnamese and were very pleased.  I haven't ordered the Pho yet, but from what we've seen in subsequent visits, the Pho looks delicious.  I have to be bones lately I've been hooked on the Pork fried rice, Pork and veggies and the egg rolls for a good long time. The Egg Rolls are fantastic, hot, crispy, and full of flavor. The Fish Sauce served with the egg rolls is amazing, I would eat it by the quart.  The Staff is friendly, service is good, atmosphere is dated  but comfortable. I wohld recommend this as a good family eating experience.

Unbelievably Tasty  My friends and I went to the Cornish Pastry Company for a bite to eat, and  all I can say is; the food was unbelievably tasty. Everyone cleaned their plates and wished there was  more.  Each person in our party ordered a different flavor, and each bite  was better than the next.  Lets face it, what's not to like?  Take flavorful meat, cheese, unique vegetable combinations, wrap it up in a flakey pastry, then bake it until hot inside and crispy outside.  Serve it up with a side dipping sauce, it doesn't get much better. While your waiting  for your delicious entrée, take advantage of the great beer selection the Cornish Pastry Company has to offer.  Sip on a ice cold draft from a great selection while your delicious entrée is baking.    The Cornish Pastry Company has a great atmosphere, very casual and comfortable.  Wish my phone wqs working because I would have taken pictures. I would  definitely go back to the Cornish Pastry Company again and again.

Maybe I need to give it another try  I needed to grab a quick bite to eat with a few work associates, so we decided to stop in at Cuban Foods and Bakery.  I was looking forward to trying this restraunt after reading so many positive reviews.  So let's start off on a positive note.  The service at Cuban Foods is great.  The staff are friendly and accomdating. I wish the food was better. We all ordered the Cuban sandwiches, as this was our first visit, and we had limited time. However, I wish I would have had the opportunity to branch out and try a few additional menu items.    The sandwich was okay, a little on the dry side, however, it  is large enough for two to share. Each person took half away so we could have ordered other items and shared easily. Maybe I should have ordered something different. The sandwich wasn't bad but it just wasn't very good.  I look forward revisiting Cuban Foods and Bakery again and try other menu items, such as rope vieja or papa rellena.

A co-worker  and I went to Thai Orchid Garden for lunch. I had chinese, and my co-worker choose a Thai entree, which gave us the opportunity to sample of both.    Thai Orchid Gaden offer beers, wines, and sake, but no full bar.  Our server appeared immediately, handing out menus and taking drink orders. They menu is large, with many tradtional Thai and Chinese food offerings.  On this visit we had Won Ton Soup, Mini Fried Eggrolls, Pad Thai, Chow Mein, and Cashew Chicken. All our entrée's were flavorful, and plated perfectly.  The chicken was moist and the veggies are tender crisp.  Everything was well seasoned and served quickly.  Thai Orchid Garden offers  a large selection of lunch specials at reasonable prices.  The service is good,  food is tasty, price are reasonable, and the servings are generous.

Won't be going back.  I really hate to give a local business a less then favorable review. Especially, if the business appears to receive positive reviews from others.   Today, my friend and I decided to go to DiVito's Pizza for lunch.  We ordered a slice of pizza, greek salad, and meatball sub. In all honesty, I would have to say that the food at DiVito's Pizza is poorly executed and of low quality.  I have eaten my fair share of meatball subs.  However, I have never been served a meatball sub that didn't have whole or sliced meatballs.  The meatballs on the subs at DiVitos are broken into small pieces, drenched in tomato sauce, and covered with cheese. The pieces of meatball were bland, soft, with a bread filling, unlike homemade meatballs which are larger, solid, and flavorful.   The pizza was equally unappetizing.  The sauce was greasy, so much so,  that we had to place a napkin on top of the pizza to soak up the grease.  The crust on the pizza was overcooked , and there was just no flavor, and the salad was old and wilted.   We walked away from DiVito's Pizza eating very little with only one thought, I won't be going back.

You can't go wrong.  If you have an early meeting or other morning event, you can't go wrong if you bring donuts from LaMar's. The donuts at LaMar's  are delicious and practically melt in your mouth. LaMar's offers a large selection of donuts to choose from.  The cinnamon twists are huge, light and fluffy, as are the glazed donuts. LaMar's offers filled bismarks, cake donuts with all types of toppings and of course donut holes.   The focus at LaMar's is on flavor and quality ingredients of the donuts. Therefore, the price per donut is a little higher than other donut places, however, these donuts are worth the price. The staff at LaMar's are great. The service is quick, and the staff are willing to accomdate whatever you want. I definitely recommend Lamars to everyone.

For All Your Party Needs.  Party City is a great store to shop for all your party needs. Party City offers basic party supplies for almost every  holiday or celebratory occasion you may have.   Recently, I had a small football party at my house.  I purchased all my plates, cups, silverware, napkins, and decorations at Party City. Most of the cuttlery and such was buy one get one free, so it was an awesome deal.  It's nice to shop at a store that has so much to offer at a great savings.  Great prices, products, and customer service. I will continue to use Party City for all my future parties.

Pleasant Surprise   I have to admit going to the gym can be intimidating .  I never know exactly what to do and probably stop in the middle of what would be considered a "full" workout.  At CrossFit gym you will never have that problem.  The staff makes a program for you. The trainers at CrossFit want to see you succeed and they truly care about your health and nutritional needs.  The philosphy and attitude at CrossFit is very motivating which helps you get through your workout.   The employees at CrossFit make it easy to want to embrace fitness because of the inviting atmosphere.   When your comfortable your more likely to come back and succeed.

Great Menu and Reasonable Prices.  I have been to Eest Asian Bistro several times and have never been disappointed.  The serving size at Eest Asian Bistro are genourous.  In fact there is no way to eat everything, even if you order a single item.   The crab rangoons are some of  the best I have ever eaten. These crab rangoon are diffrent from other restaurants. The crab rangoon are made from a thin crispy shell and they are absolutely  melt in your mouth delicious.  I have tried many of the entrées at Eest Asian Bistro and have never been disappointed.    In addition, to great food Eest Asian Bistro is a great place to dine and relax.  The restaurant is always clean, quiet,  and the staff is always welcoming and will accommodate your ever need. Eest Asian Bistro might not be a  busy place, however I go back every chance I get because the food is so amazing and prices are very reasonable for the size of servings.   I've  had  eaten at the restaurant and have had  take out and it is great every single time. If you enjoy Asian cuisine, give Eest Asian Bistro a try.

How Good Depends On What You Order.   I have been to Carolina's a few times.  The food at Carolona's is hit or miss and the quality really depends on what you order.  Once inside you walk up to the  order windows  and select your entrée from a large menu.    As you wait for your entree to arrive you can hear staff calling out order numbers. Once our number was called we made our way up front grabbed our plates and asked for some salsa, that is  available in small paper cups filled by big stainless steel dispensers.  The hard-shell machaca burrito, rice and beans, horchata and tortillas were just okay. However, I found the cheese enchiladas to be mediocre (tortillas are hard, very little cheese).  The meal just wasn't very good.  It might be a while before I decide to re-visit Carolina's.

You get what you pay for.  I wasn't expecting fine dining when I decided to take my nephew and three of his friend to CiCi's. However, I was expecting a better experience then what we had.  Cici's is an all you can eat pizza, salad, soup, and pasta restaurant.   So, lets start with pizza. The pizza offerings were at best, so-so. We requested a pizza to be made, but apparently that was not possible. Cici's only replaces a few "standard" offerings for dine-in eaters, and stuff crust pepperoni pizza, isnt on the list.   Moving on to the salad nar. The salad bar was freshened up frequently, which was welcomed.  However, the salad bar consist of iceburg lettuce, peppers, tomatoes, olives. No cheese, no egg, no romaine.   CiCi's offets soup and pasta on their buffet. The chicken noodle soup was all broth, no chicken, no noodles, just broth.  I asked one of the servers if there was any soup that had noodles.  She replied, probably not.  The pasta has a choice of  either Alfredo or Tomato Sauce,  both were watery and tasteless.  I know CiCi's is inexpensive, however, next time I will spend a bit more and go elsewhere.  I can eat almost anything, especially at an all you can eat buffet.  This time I couldnt finish a plate.  I would never revisit CiCi'sand and would definitely not recommend it.

Majerles Sports Bar has plenty of room and a large bar area! The service is great and the food is very good!   Majerles offers  a great Happy Hour menu with drinks and food. One of my usual food favorites is the Southwest Chicken Salad and Slam Dunk Shrimp which are both really good and large portions as well.   Majerles  is just a great place to catch a game, any game. I like the fact that Majerles keeps the volume on the game instead of playing music like some sports bars.  Majerles is the  perfect atmosphere to watch a game or just hang out with friends. If your in the area you should give Majerles a try because Thunder Dan's place is worth the visit.

Donuts or Doughnuts?  Sometimes, when I have a hankering for a donut and latte, I find myself driving towards Dunkin Donuts.    Maybe because Dunkin Donuts is such a good deal. If you purchase a refillable mug you can get refills of almost anything you want for a $1.00 and if you fill out a survey on the back of the receipt you can get a free donut.   The selection is great, staff is friendly, and the quality outstanding.  If you're every in the area stop by.

Where Everyone Knows Your Name   Blossom Asian  Cuisine has some of the best tasting food that is different from any other Asian restaurant I've eaten at. The food was amazing and service was great.  Loved the atmosphere too.   I was surprised to see how many customere the staff knew by name.  Not only does the staff know of a lot of their  customers by name but the staff at Blossoms Asian Cuisine remembers the favorite dishes of their regular customers.  Now that's what I call customer service.  On my first visit I ordered crab puffs, teriyaki chicken, chicken egg foo young, and egg flower soup.  I Haven't had soup that good in a long time and the Chicken Egg Foo Young  is a dish I would  definitely order again.  The service at Blossom Asian Cuisone was out of this world! From sitting down and immediately having water, to drinks being brought right away. Never an empty glass. All servers were so happy and polite and just like my fellow yelper "Laz" said they remembered him by name.  The staff remembers many customers by name, it's nice to visit an establishment where everyone knows your name.

Amazing Tribute  My Nephew and I went to the Wesley Bolin Memorial Plaza to visit the memorial.   We've read many positive reviews about Wesley Bolin Memorial Plaza and thought  it was time to go and see for ourselves . Hard to believe,  after all these years of Iiving in Arizona I had never visited Wesley Bolin Memorial Plaza, until recently.   If you haven't had an opportunity to explore the memorial you need to plan a visit.  The memorial is a amazing tribute  to Arizona service personnel who've lost their lives fighting for our country in various wars.  The plaza is surrounded by grass and is very clean.  The park is a great place to stop, get out, relax, and learn a few things.  The exhibit is all outdoors and streches  about one city block, making it is an easy level walk for just about anyone and the exhibit is free.  Among the histotic monuments is the U.S.S. Arizona anchor and mast, and various mouments such as the Navajo Code Talkers of Word War II, an educational monument to the Bill of Rights, Vietnam War memorial, 9-11 memorial, a Law Enforcement Canine Memorial, and many more historical figures.  The old state capitol is across the street, with it's copper dome. How much time youll spend at Wesley Bolin Memorial is up to you,  it will depend on how much you wish to see.

Wine and more is truly second to none, when shopping  for wine and spirts.  I planned  on making a quick trip however,  I stayed much longer then I anticipated.   My favorite place for wine   Total Wine and More carries wines from every wine-producing region in the world and from every price range. It is easy to lose track of time as you walk down  the aisles admiring the selection .  In addition to wines I enjoy looking at the selection of beers that range from America's most popular to hard-to-find microbrews and imports.   It can be challenging at times to make a decision on what to purchase.   However, the staff at Total Wine and More are pleasant, accommodating, and very knowledgeable.  The staff will even offer suggestions, or direct you to your preferences.   If you haven't been to Total Wine and More, you should stop by.

Disappointing    Today, I was craving a chicken and rice bowl and deicded to go to Yoshi's. The facility is fairly clean and the staff is  friendly, accomdating, and the prices are very  reasonable.   For under seven dollars, I was able to purchase , a soft drink, eggroll, and teriyaki chicken  bowl. The order took  less then 5 minutes to prepare. Now, in all fairness While I shouldn't expect much for seven dollars, I was dissapointed nonetheless, as the teriyaki chicken was dry, the sauce was sugary, and the white rice was overcooked and lumpy.  Overall, it was worth the price and fills the stomach, however I won't be going back any time soon.

Wouldn't Go Anywhere Else.  The crew at Discount Tires is second to none.  When I noticed, a small leak in one of my tires. I brought my vehicle to Discount Tire to have the tire looked at before it went flat.   Once I arrived at Discount Tires I noticed it was almost closing time. I asked the sales associate if there was any possibility to have a tire checked for a leak, and he said, "absolutely".   My tire had a chunk or wood in it.  I must have ran over something and didn't realize it.  The folks at Discount Tire had me back on the road in no time at all.  Discount Tire has consistently performed at a level seldom seen these days. The sales force is knowledgeable and can make solid suggestions if you give them sufficient information as to your needs. I am so glad I went to and will continue to go to Discount Tires.

Look No Further  If you're  looking for a great salon, look no further.  J's  Salon has a unique atmosphere, with friendly and talented stylists.   I was refered to J's salon when my stylist moved to Prescott and am I ever glad I was, I only wish I'd had gone sooner!  I've been going to Tina for years and my hair has never looked or felt better. On every visit I am treated as a valued client and  leave loving my cut and color.  I have to admit I have had  some real hair disasters in the past so I tend to be a little stressed. However, Tina always listens to exactly what I want and has never failed to deliver! Tina is  truly a master stylist.  The staff at J's Salon are always friendly, and more than accommodating. I have never waited more than five minutes. I've recommended J's Salon to family and friends and everyone I know has been thrilled with their hair and their experience at the Salon.   I can't think of enough great things to say about J's Salon - it is  truly a Salon that cares about their clients.

First time but not my last.  Today, was my first visit to Mellow Mushroom. We arrived at 11:30  on a Thursday for lunch. There were about 20 guests already, however, we were seated immediately.   Mellow Mushroom offers a varied selection of entrée's and brews. I chose the lunch special: 8" pepperoni pizza for $4.99. I added one topping and a drink for a total of $9.24.   My lunch arrived in 15 minutes. My entree was piping hot with plenty of mozzarella, sauce and toppings. The crust was soft and flavorful as was the sauce and toppings   The service was exceptional. The pizza was delicious. I can't wait to go back for my next visit.

Everything you want in a coffee shop   Once in a while I  just have to give in to my "Cartel Coffee Lab" cravings and get my fix.  Today, I visited Cartel Coffee with a co-worker who is a "regular".  The atmosphere at Cartel Coffee Lab is warm, inviting, and relaxed. Cartel Coffee Lab is very popular with a varied  cross section of the community. On any given day you can see young professionals, students, families, and retirees sitting around using  lap tops, chatting, and enjoying their beverage of choice   The baristas at Cartel Coffee Lab clearly know their stuff.  These folks are encyclopedias of everything coffee related. I can't think of a better way to start my day then with the perfect Americano and a pop de tarte.      Cartel Coffee is a great shop with lots of local color but, don't visit if you're in a hurry, once you take a seat, you won't want to leave.

Amazing Park with a View.  I really enjoy the trails at Estrella Mountain Regional Park. The trails are moderate difficulty however it's great exercise. The trails are well marked and dispaly amazing views of the west valley.   The park consists of beautiful desert, wetlands, a large grassy area, and lots of lush green trees. There are picnic tables under ramadas and primitive camping is allowed (for a fee). There are covered play areas for kids, and restrooms with running water for hand washing.   Estrella Mointain Regional Park is a great place to take the family for a picnic, hiking, photos of the family, or relax and enjoy the beauty of Arizona.

Great prices and exceptional customer service  After spending the entire day shoping for furnirure I was exhausted when it was time to shop for a new mattress.   All I needed was a mattress, and then I would be done, how challenging can purchasing a mattress  be, after all it's just a mattress.  How wrong was I.  Matress shopping might sounds easy but there are lots of options and it is easy to get confused.  At Mattress Firm Jesus cleared all my confusion and  I found  exactly what I was looking for, for half the price I would have paid somehere else and the quality of the mattress was exxeptional.  Mattress Firm doesn't have any fancy displays or bedroom set ups.  All Matress Firm has is mattress's.  What I enjoyed most about matress firm; their were no high pressure sales pitches.  Jesus gave me the information about mattress sets and then let me make the decission.  When I made my purchase I notices I was $29.89 short and Jesus took additional money of the purchase price. With great prices and exceptional customer service I'll be back again.

My Favorite Spot   I have to admit I love my coffee and I always stop at this Starbucks store. I realize there are many Starbucks locations.  However, this location is my favorite.  This location is clean and feels comfortable. I usually get a latte or frappe.   My coffee is always made the way I order and tastes great. In addition, to great coffee Starbucks has delicious pastries if you need a snack.   Great coffee, snacks, and customer service.  What more could you ask for.

Wings Done Right  Wing Stop, by far has some of the best wings in the state. If you're a fan of wings, then you need to go to Wing Stop and pick up a dozen or maybe even two dozen right this second.   The wings at Wing Stop are 100% all white meat,  served to order piping hot.  Wing Stop offers a variety of flavors,  from Atomic to Teriyaki.  The wings at Wing Stop are crispy, moist, and of descent size.  The Hawaiian, and Garlic Parmesan were delicious. The parmesan cheese added just the right finishing touch.  Wing Stop allows you to Mix and match your orders.  You can combine regular wings and boneless wings.     In addition to wings, Wing Stop has some great side items to accompany your wings.  You have to try the homestyle fries which are cut fresh daily.  If fries aren't to your tasting then maybe the homemade potato salad, cole slaw, bourbon baked beans, or fresh baked rolls are.  The rolls are fresh, hot, and absolutely delicious.   The staff at Wing Stop are friendly and helpful.  There is limited seating so get there early. On this visit we got our wings to go.  If you call ahead your order will be ready for pick up when you arrive. If your craving wings give Wing Stop a try you will not be disappointed.

Wing Stop. by far has some of the best wings in the state.   If you're a fan of wings, then you need to go to Wing Stop and pick up a dozen or maybe even two dozen right this second. My sister and I go to wing stop often and we have never had a bad expeirence.  The wings at Wing Stop are 100% all white meat, served to order piping hot.  The wings are crispy, moist, and of descent size. The Hawaiian, and Garlic Parmesan were delicious and happen to be my two of my favorites. The Hawaiian styles wing have just the right amount of tangy sweetness and parmesan cheese adds just the right finishing touch.   What I like best about Wing Stop is that  you are allowed to Mix and match your orders. You can combine regular wings and boneless wings together. Usually, I order a combination of both.  However, bone in traditional is my favorite. I could have ate a few dozen by myself but decided I probably should share.  Everytime I go to Wing Stop I order the homestyle fries which are cut fresh daily. The fries are crispy and golden brown and very tasty.  My sister isnt a fan of fries but enjoys the homemade potato salad, and fresh baked rolls. The rolls are fresh, hot, buttery, and absolutely delicious.   The prices are reasonable and the food is great. If you decided to eat at Wing Stop arrive early because there is limited seating.   The staff at Wing Stop are friendly and helpful. So stop by and give them a try.

Like a taste from the Northeast   I think of myself as a Italian food aficionado (remember I am self proclaiming here) so I have admit I enjoyed a Taste of Italy when I  visited.    I think my favorite entrée on the menu may have been the Italian Anti Pasta salad.  The anti pasta salad  is enough for 2 or 3 people, however, the last time I visited a Taste of Italy  I literally at the entire anti pasta salad myself.  In addition, to my salad I ordered the calzone special with pepperoni, sausage,meatball, mushroom , green pepper, ricotta, and mozzarella cheese.  The calzone was absolutely delicious. The calzone was served with a golden brown crust and stuffed with fresh ingredients.   Service at a Taste of Italy is truly great.  The staff is very attentive, friendly, and accomdating.  Our  drinks/water were never empty and the food is reasonably priced and delicious.

I am a creature of habit and usually when I find a business  that has good customer service I will keep going back to that business.  However, tonight I did not go to my usual CVS and went to a different one.  I went into CVS  because my nephew  had been feeling ill and I thought it would be a good idea to stock up on some over the counter medicine. When I arrived at the store I wasn't quite sure what medicine would be the appropriate medicine to take. So I went to the pharmacy to get some assistance.   There were three employees behind the counter.  Not even one of the employees greeted me or even acknowledge I was waiting.  After a few minutes of waiting I finally asked if someone could answer a question.  The employee gave the impression that they were annoyed. I purchased a few items a d left the store.  I like CVS and keep going back because rewards deals are great and CVS is open 24 hours. I won't stop.goi g to CVS, however, I won't go back to this location.

It's Worth A Look  I needed to pick up a gift card and toy for my friends son's birthday, so I decided to visit Toys R Us .   I was looking for hard to find toy (Black Panter Marvel action figure) . Let me just say, the sales associates at Toys R Us go out of their way to help you locate exactly what you are looking for. It's a nice change when a sales associate walks you over to where an item is located instead of pointing and saying "over there".  Toys R Us has electronics, games, bikes, videos and everything inbetween.  Reasonable prices, and helpful sales associates keep me coming back

Gas and so much more.  QuikTrip is always a great choice when it comes to refueling.  I find it a challenge to just purchase "gas" when I visit a QuikTrip.  I like the soda fountain station, and the  multitude of snacks QuikTrip has to offer. I always manage to find a snack I hadn't had in quite some time, and it just calls my name.  In addition,  just like all quick trips this store is extremely clean, even more so then normal.   Reasonably priced gas, ice cold drinks, and snacks, it doesn't  get any better.

If I have to give a star I guess I will.  I believe you have to try to find at least one positive aspect out of every dining experience.  So lets start on a positive note. The staff at 32nd Cafe are very friendly and accommodating. They truly like to make their guests feel welcomed.  However, I think the server was thrown when she took our plates and there was very little food eaten.  Now for the not so pleseant aspects. The food at 32nd Cafe is very disappointing.  If it was possible to give no stars  I would however, that's not an option, so if  I have to give a star I guess I will give one.  The food at 32nd Cafe is poorly excuted and to be honest just has a bad taste. The salsa tastes like ketchup, and every entrée is smothered in the same bland-tasting sauce and covered in cheese. Covering entrées in cheese does not make the entree taste better. Bad tasting food is worse then food that lacks taste. There's nothing authentic or delicious on the menu.  It just wasn't good.

NYPD Never Disappoints  On every visit to NYPD I am seated promptly and the service is always outstanding.  There has never been a time where I had to wait for anything and  the staff at NYPD is very accommodating.   As a New Yorker I can be pretty picky when it comes to my pizza. I really enjoy a good slice of New York style pizza folded in half and loaded with toppings and NYPD never fails me.   NYPD serves up an authentic pie with just the right amount of Oregano and Basil seasoning.  On top of the fabulous sauce  NYPD never skimps on ingredients.  This pizza has lots and lots of toppings and your leftover pizza is even better tasting the next day when reheated, you can't say that about just any pizza.  I am never disappointed with NYPD I guess that's why I keep on coming back for more.

Great Little Find  Once in a while I like to surprise my Father with cigars and Fine Ash Cigars is the only place I go.   As you walk in  to Fine Ash Cigars the smell is amazing (although I dont smoke cigars).   I have to admit I am not knowledgable when it comes to cigars, but you don't need to be if you go to Fine Ash Cigars. There are so many choices, so I always ask  the staff for help and  Sam and Rosie take their time to educate their customers as well.   Not only are the owners friendly and inviting so are all the patrons. Great Prices, Great Selection, and Knowledgable Staff.  I will definitely go back to Fine Ash Cigars for my next purchase.

Always a great treat   Baskin-Robbins has always been a lot time favorite of mine.  Quality confections, quickly prepared and reasonably priced.   The staff is always friendly and service is always fast. The hardest part of my visit is making a selection with so many flavors to choose from.  Once you make a selection you will have your ice cream in hand within minutes, reguardless of how busy the store is.  So if your looking for geeat icecream head to Baskin-Robbins for a  mouth-watering experience.

Not my first choice  Super Star Carwash  offers car washes, auto detailing and oil lube services. I have never had my car detailed or taken advantage of the oil services, however, I have had many carwashes.  Super Star always offers coupons and specials and their prices are very competitive. However,  I have to be honest, on more then one occasion I have been more then disappointed with the quality of the wash I received. Usually, after my wash, my vehicle has streaks on the windows, side mirrors are really ever cleaned, and tire dressing isn't noticeable. If you ask one of the staff to reclean the areas, they do so without hesitation. It's just frustrating to have to ask to have noticeable areas re-cleaned.

Personal Service... It does exist.  You will never  have to ask for samples at See's Candy, however you can pig there something special you want to taste . The samples aren't the small typical sample sizes.. They are the full size chocolates.  I always manage to have a few chocolates before I make my choices on what to buy.  The chocolates are sold by weight and can be ship anywhere.  See's offers speciality items at different times of the year. Be sure stop in for a visit when you want a sweet treat.  You will be very pleased with the high quality.  In fact their motto is "Quality without compromise".  The service at See's  is outstanding, the staff is very friendly and very helpful. Nice to see that personal service still exist.

Mid-day treat.  I really enjoy yogurtland, it is one of my favorite self serve yogurt places. All the flavors at yogurtland are so tasty, like,  Madagascar Vanilla, Dutch chocolate, pistachio, or my favorite Irish Mint Creme.  The staff at yogurtland will always greet you as you enter the store. You can sample any flavor you wish before making your selection.  Then comes the challenging part, deciding what flavor you want, because  they are all so good. In addition to great flavors, yogurtland has a multitude of toppings to choose from.   Yogurtland is  super clean inside,  very colorful decor, and the staff is friendly.   If you like yogurt, you should try yogurtland.

Nothing Fancy but Oh So Good.  You couldn't tell by looking at the outside.  However, as the old adage goes " You can't judge a book by its cover."  The same can be said about Rocket Burgers and Subs. Nothing fancy here but the food is oh so good.  The food at Rocket Burgers and Subs   doesn't cost much more than the average fast food establishments around town.  However, you would be challenged to find a burger that compares to the quality and taste of the food  served at Rocket Burgers and Subs.  Rocket Burgers and Subs serves up various styles of burgers, beef hot dogs, sandwiches, and of course subs.  On this visit I went with the Lunch Special ($4.99).  The lunch special consisted of a burger, fresh cut fries, and a soft drink.  The lunch special was a great price and the food was delicious.  The hamburger roll was perfectly grilled, hamburger  grilled to medium, and the fries which were made from fresh cut potatoes with skins  were seasoned perfectly and so tasty.  In addition to great food, Rocket Burgers has the largest selection of bottled sodas I have ever seen. Every soda combination you can imagine and even those you can't is served at Rocket Burger.  The  dining is casual. You order at the counter and seat yourself. The prices are more then reasonable, staff is friendly, portion sizes are large, and the food is delicious.  What more could you ask for.

One of the worst salads    Carl's Jr and I have always had an on again off again relationship based on their hit and miss quality of food.  I have had some great food at Carl's Jr and some of the absolute worst food a Carl's Jr.  Today, the absolute worst took on a whole new meaning.     Two co-workers and I decided to grab a quick bite to eat.  So we headed to Carl's Jr for a salad.  I was really disappointed. We ordered the grilled chicken salad which consisted of wilted mixed greens, unripe tomato and chicken which was like pencil eraser pellets, didn't seem like real meat. I just could not bring myself to even eat one piece.   Not appetizing at all. I tried to pick out all the wilted green, unripe tomatoes, and unappetizing chicken. I thought okay things should be better. Now with the horrible chicken taste removed all that was left was cucumbers. Don't think I will be back any time soon.

Ok, so last night I was feeling a bit lazy and decided to take my nephew and sister out for dinner.  I had visited Joey's once before and had recently received a gift certificate from Tammie, the owner.  So we decided to give Joeys another try.    I usually don't like hot dogs but my nephew had the chili cheese hot dog with onion rings and all I have to say is, that hot dog was yummy, fresh, and served hot.  After just one bite my nephew had me convinced that there is nothing better in life than a hot dog with tasty onion rings and a soda.    My sister had the Italian beef sandwich with cheese.  I have to admit,  I have  always loved a  good cheese steak but I hate getting fatty meat so I'm picky about where I get them, I am pleased to  say, not one bit of fat was on my sisters sandwich. Oh yeah, I love the amount of cheese that was loaded on the sandwich, no skimping there!!!  I went with the fish and chips meal and it was delicious!  The crunchy coating is not greasy, the fish is moist and tasty, and the portion size was enough for two.  My second visit to Joeys was wonderful ...  I will be back again!!

Breakfast Club  On more then one occasions  I have driven by TJ's Homestyle Restaurant and asked myself, why are all these people waiting around for some hole-in-the-wall restaurant, could the food be that good?  Well, today I decided to find out for myself.  Don't expect anything fancy at TJ's. This is a down home, comfort food type of restaurant. In fact, TJ'S Homestyle comfort food is so popular that you'll most likely have to wait for a table, but it's well worth the wait.  The menu has many options from pancakes, omelets, biscuits & gravy, pastries, breakfast sandwiches and everything in between. It was so hard to choose.  Today, I tried the French Toast Combo. Two huge pieces of French Toast, 2 eggs, and 2 slices of bacon. The  French toast is made with homemade French Bread and it's delicious.  This French Toast is thick, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, and oh so satisfying. You will be filled with just one slice but it is so good you will eat two.   TJ's Homestyle Restaurant is only open for breakfast and lunch so don't make dinner plans. However,  if you want a great Breakfast, at a great price, and value great customer service then make this hole-in-the-wall part of your breakfast club.

Great Customer Service  With School right around the corner I decided to take my nephew for a haircut.  I am so glad we decided to go to Sportclips.  As soon as we walked in the door we were greeted by the stylist, who took our name.  The prices at Sportclips  are clearly posted on the wall so there was no confusion on the cost.  We waited less then 5 minutes before my nephews name was called.  The stylist took her time and gave my nephew the best cut he has ever had. After the hair cut we were offered soda or water.   At Sportclips you don't have to remember what hair  products you purchased or style haircut you received because Sportclips does that for you. Sportclips has a customer database that has all your information saved for your next visit.  Great Customer service, professional trained staff, we will be back again.

Like the Deli   This may not be my favorite Fry's Food store to shop at however,  I'm a creature of habit and this Fry's is the closest to my house.  So when I'm short on time this is the Fry's I usually find myself at.  I usually can find everything that I need with no problems. The sales associates are very polite, friendly, and helpful.  The prices at Fry's are competitive in comparison with other grocery stores in the area.   I like the deli section at the Fry's supermarket they serve Boars Head sandwich meats which happens to be one of my favorites.  The Deli  service can be slow at times but is worth the wait. If you ever need a six foot sub Fry's has a really nice selection to choose from and they all are delicious and reasonably priced.

A little Disappointed   Went to Yogis Grill to have a late lunch and meet with family and friends. Some of my lunch companions had sushi, which was just average at best, others had teppanyaki which in all honesty was soggy and lacked flavor. The  other entrée's on the menu we sampled  were, spring rolls, beef & chicken terakayi  bowls, gyoza, udon, and all these entrée's just weren't very good.   Have been to 2 locations of Yoshi Grill and they seem to be about the same quality of food.

This Time ,,, Not So Good   I have always had a high-quality, hot meal that tastes great at Samurai Sam's. The staff is always friendly and you're greeted the minute you walk in the door.  However, today I was very disappointed in the quality of the food.  I ordered a Steak Yakisoba Bowl, pot stickers, and drink. After placing my order I was handed a cup so I headed over to the soft drinks, and even before I poured my drink the cashier put my tray on the counter and told me my meal was ready. I grabbed my tray and headed for my table.  After taking just one took bite I realized my meal wasn't hot, it couldn't even be considered warm.  So I brought my dish back up to the counter, where the cashier apologized and advised she would get me a new "hot" dish.  A few minutes later my meal was replaced and it was very hot (smoking to be exact), it was also very tasteless. The vegetables, a mix of cabbage, broccoli and carrots had no flavor whatsoever and the steak was so dry and overcooked from being re-heated that it was impossible to eat.  The potstickers were terrible, they were hard, dry, and over cooked.   This was the first time that I ate very little and was not able  to finish what I ordered even tho I was hungry... I just couldn't do it.

Simply Fresh and Delicious.  Recently, my friends and I went to GreenMix for lunch. GreenMix resembles a cafeteria-style Restaurant, with fresh salads, soups, and sandwiches. We were greeted by the staff as we made our way to the counter. I choose to create my own salad  and it was delicious. Iceberg lettuce, chicken, apples, cranberries, asiago cheese, topped with cinnamon pecans and homemade pomegranate dressing.  My lunch companions had the Korean BBQ Beef and they both said the Korean  BBQ Neefwas one of the best wraps they ever had.  I think on my next visit I will have to try the Korean BBQ Beef myself.   The service is friendly and quick with no lunch line hold up. Plenty of seating with  employees who happily picked up our empty plates.  An excellent option for a quick, or leisurely, lunch that won't put a dent in your wallet.

Not So Good... Half star ...   What can I say about Arribas Mexican Grill. Let's start on a positive note.  The staff is warm, friendly, and extremely personable, which is why I feel horrible for saying their Mexican Food is bland and tasteless.   I really wanted to like Arribas Mexican Grill. After all I had been to the Phoenix location and the food wasn't bad. However, the way to begin a meal is not with a watery tomato salsa and a puny bowl of broken chips.   I have to give Arribas props for their cheese crisp. The cheese crisp was loaded with cheese and extra crispy. However, the enchiladas were soggy and brunt on the ends. Followed by  the overcooked rice and flavorless refried beans.  Not the worst Mexican food on earth, but it is a contender.

Looks Can Be Deceiving.... A Twist on an Old Favorite    It has been said that you shouldn't  judge a book by its cover.  Well the same can be said about cupcakes! You shouldn't judge a cupcake by its cover.  I have to admit Kreative Kupcake Bakery took me by surprise. The cupcakes at Kreative Kupcake Bakery might look simple, but they taste delicious.  On my first visit I purchased a half dozen.  Even though the decision was hard I went with, Death by Chocolate, Blue Moon, Red Velvet, Chocolate Ganache, Samoa Girl Scout Cookie, and last but not least Caramel-n-Sea Salt.  The frosting's were creamy and delicious. The toppings are perfect, not too thick or thin and the cake is so moist and so flavorful.   All of the cupcake flavors are equally amazing! However,  my favorite was the Samoa Girl Scout Cookie. It is the cupcake version of the Girl Scout Samoa cookie. The combination of chocolate, caramel, and coconut is simply amazing! My mouth is salivating just thinking about my next visit.  These cupcakes are definitely at the top of my list as exceptional! So if you get a craving and have to give in to your sweet tooth, give Kreative Kupcake Bakery a try!!

Just what I'm looking for.  CVS is always a great choice when it comes to picking up a quick item or two.  I find it a challenge to just purchase "what I was looking for" when I visit  CVS.  I like the pharmacy, and the  multitude of snacks and "as seen on tv"  items CVS has to offer. I always manage to find a snack I hadn't had in quite some time, and it just calls my name.   Reasonably priced,convenient locations, and helpful staff makes all the difference .

Expecting better ... was disappointed.  There aren't many places to get Hawaiian BBQ, and I was curious when I came across Leo's Island Grill.  Especially after reading all the positive reviews.  I hate to say it but I was a little disappointed. I was  expecting better on my first visit to Leo's Island Grill.     Leo's Island Grill serves their meals on Styrofoam platters.  The large styrofoam platters come with your entre selection over cabbage, double scoop of rice, and macaroni salad. The portions are very generous enough for two.  My chicken was a bit stringy and a little on the fatty side. My lunch companion ordered the combo which mixed three meats, with rice and macaroni salad. All of the food was somewhat bland and to be honest somewhat flavorless.  The prices at Leo's Island Grill are extremely reasonable for the amount of food served. The staff is friendly and, the store is clean.  I guess you could do worse in a pinch.

Old World Charm   In the Phoenix Metro Area there are an abundant amount of restraunts that  cater towards fine dining, however, few stand out.  Litchfields is a fine dining establishment that defintely stands out among the rest.   Litchfields is part of the Wigwam Resort in Litchfield Park, AZ, which attracts a mixture of vacationers, locals,  and business clientele.   Litchfields has an open design, with a rustic decor emphasizing the history of Goodyear and the Litchfield family. If you're in a adventurous or romantic mood dinning outside under the stars is recommended; as outdoor fireplaces and heaters are provided for those willing to brave the chill of the evening air.  The service at Litchfields is impeccable and second to none. Our server was knowledgable, and attentive without being intrusive. All the questions we had reference menu items, wines, and salads were answered and suggestions were given based on our preferences.   After placing our order we brought a nice half boule of warm bread, which was delicious. The food at Litchfields is all fresh, organic and locally sourced to the greatest extent possible.   I ordered the Filet and my dinner companion had the the New York Strip. Both entrées were very generous cuts. The meat was very tender, flavorful, and  rivaled those served at any high-end steak house. You can chose from a half dozen side dishes (carrots, asparagus, heirloom potatoes) to accompany your steak.   Although I was completely satisfied and full.  I had to finish off with a nice creme brule. A perfect ending to an amazing dining experience.

Never Disappoints  The Arrogant Butcher was recommended by a friend and is a Fox Restaurant Concept, generally known for more upscale type establishments.  The atmosphere at Arrogant Butcher is  trendy and has a relaxing vibe.  As we arrived we were greeted by a very friendly hostess who made us feel genuinely welcome. Then a few minutes later our server, added to that feeling. All our questions were answered about the menu, and our server made suggestions based on our perferences.  We started our dining expeirence with appetizers, which were delicious.  I highly recommend the freshly made pretzel balls served with provolone cheese fondue. The pretzels are so fresh and fluffy, our server told us the pretzels are made on site every day. On this visit we also sampled the roasted peppers toast, smoked salmon toast, and the prosciutto deviled eggs.  All which I would order again.    For dinner I had the sea bass with creamy barley.  My entree  was absolutely delicious.  My dinner companions had the crab stuffed chicken which he said was the best he ever had. The portions were the perfect size and cooked to perfection.   As good as the entrees were, they were matched by the dessert selections.  We split the salted caramel pudding (my favorite), the peanut butter cup, and the pumpkin cheesecake, you couldn't go wrong with any of those. The desert were fantastic.  The service was perfect and our server was friendly and there at the right time every time.  We will definitely come back again.

Friendly and Knowledgeable Staff  I have never purchased a bike from Trek Bicycle Sotre of West Phoenix.  However, I brought my nephews bike in for a repair. The staff is very patient and knowledgeable. The products are top notch. Even the lowest priced items are of very high quality.  I highly recommend this store if your looking to purchase or repair a existing bicycle.  The next time I am in the market to purchase a bivcycle, Trek is where I will go.

A taste of Cambodia in Phoenix, Arizona.   You don't have to travel far to experience a taste of Cambodia, you can get your very own taste of Cambodia right here in Phoenix, Arizona, at Reathrey Sekong.  Today, was my first dining experience at Reathrey Sekong based on the recommendation of a co-worker and fellow "yelper".  From the outside, Reathrey Sekong might be an inconspicuous restaurant, however this little gem serves up  some of the best Cambodian cuisine you'll find anywhere.   I will be the first to admit, I am not an experet on Cambodian cuisin, so I can't speak to authenticity.  However, I do know fresh, deliciously flavored cuisine, and that is exactly what you will get when you go to Reathey Sekong.  The menu is expansive with a variety of  soups, salads, sandwiches, noodles, fried rice, speciality drinks, and desserts.  On today's visit, I ordered the eggrolls, Bai Cha Beef Fried Rice, and Basil Seed drink, which is very refreshing.  Our entrees were fresh, flavorful, and absolutely delicious.  I can't wait to visit Reathey Sekong again.  There are so many more entrée's from the menu I would like to sample, such as the noodle soups, sandwiches, boba, but, my taste buds will have to wait for my next visit.  So, if you're craving great food, attentive staff, prompt service, pleasant atmosphere , and reasonable prices, stop by Reathey Sekong.

So good and so close to work.  One Coffee Company is located in the downtown Phoenix area and is close to   my office, and I am so thankful that this little gem of a  coffee shop is so close.  I have not been to One Coffee Company  for awhile and decided it was time to visit once  again. I ordered the white mocha latte and a raspberry scone and both were delicious.   WiFi is available.   Service is fast and prices reasonable. If. Your in the area stop by you won't be disappointed.

GREAT FOOD!   Don Poncho  is a great restaurant with very little pretense, stellar food and excellent service.  So if you are looking for really good Mexican cuisine look no more. Don Poncho  is one of  the best Mexican food places in the valley.   There are plenty of choices for appetizers, entrees and desserts.  Every dish is visually enticing. The pastor sopes are wonderful some of  the best I've ever tasted and the Chile Rellenos are off the charts delicious!   Highly recommended to all looking for authentic Mexican food in a town consumed with chain "Mexican Restaurants".

Better then you might think.  I really enjoy Tortas Paquime and have dined at both locations. Tortas Paquin is clean, busy and has great food. The entrée's at Torta Paquime are reasonably priced, made fresh to order, and absolutely delicious.   The carnitas  and ribeye tacos are some of the best I've had anywhere and the tortas are not only delicious but very large as well. So be prepared to go hungry and have leftovers. Make sure you ask for a side of the pickled onions, jalapenos and carrots (they're free).    You never walk away from Tortas Paquime hungry but leave some room for a dessert because the ice cream and pastries will satisfy your sweet tooth.  Great service and excellent food, if your in the area you should stop by, you will not be disappointed.

Sometimes you just have to have a burger.  There are those days, when you just have to have a buger.  So when you are craving a greasy, fast-food, burger like no other, make Freddy's Frozen Custard & Steakburgers your stop.   Tonight, my family and I feasted on double burgers, Chicago dogs, fries, and onion rings. The food was served hot and made to order. I really enjoyed the hot dog.  The Chicago Dog is served on a grilled the bun, and yes it was buttery goodness. The fries are shoestring and served piping hot and the steakburgers, although thin are delicious and are served fresh.  The only downside, they need to do a better job at busing down the seating area, it was hard to find a clean table.  So if your craving good food fast, stop by Freddy's.

Bellissimo   I've  been to this small, local gem multiple times and I must say La Bona Pasta never fails to please.  La Bona Pasta is a great place to enjoy a leisurely-paced meal, allowing plenty of time for conversation and relaxation.    As you walk into La Bona Pasta you can't help but notice the aroma of fresh bread baking.  You are greeted the moment you walk in and are seated promptly. Once seated you are given  a complimentary basket of assorted breads and rolls with soft butter, and the bread is absolutely delicious.  La Bona Pasta offers a variety of menu options, to satisfy just about anyone desire. Each entree comes with a choice of soup or salad.  At tonight's visit, we had the minestrone soup, which was enjoyed by all. Our entrees ran the gamut from Spaghetti Bolognese with meatballs, Lasanga, to Eggplant Parmesan.  The portions at La Bona Pasta are generous and all entrees received praise.  The eggplant parmesan came with bowtie pasta featuring a marinara/alfredo sauce.  The Bolognese featured a wonderfully spiced sauce and three generously-sized meatballs, and the lasanga was flavorful and delicious.  We will definitely be returning to this local faimly owned ans operated restraunt in the future and we would urge others to do the same.  You won't be disappointed.

First visit but it won't be my last.  Today, was my first visit to Good Fellas Grill, but it won't be my last .  All I have to say is you can't go wrong with any of the  menu selections at Good Fellas Grill.   At Good Fellas grill you are offered a complimentary bowl of soup with your entree.  Today, I selected the chicken and potato soup and my lunch companion had the lentil soup.  Both soups were delicuous. The  chicken and potato soup is loaded with chicken and potatoes.  Both soups were very flavorful , and so satisfying.   From the gyro sandwich to the chicken lettuce wrap, every entree was delicious and brusting with flavorful. On my next visit I want  to try the sautéed chicken it is served with, basmati rice, tomato slices and sweet onions and it looks delicious l.  The food and service are amazing, and did I mention lunch specials start at $5.99.  So if your looking for a  great value, fresh made to order meals,  in a comfortable environment, then look no further then Good Fellas Grill.

Not what I was expecting   I really dislike giving a restaurant a less then favorable review when the reviews are mostly positive.  So let's start this review on a positive note. The service at ZK Grill is great.  The staff is accomadating, friendly, without being intrusive.  However, for me the food was below average.  Today my lunch companion and I had the Chicken Entrée for lunch.  Our entrée consisted of Chicken, salad, rice, and a roasted tomato. If you like rice this dish has plenty of it.  In fact, you will  receive a very generous portion  of rice with your meal, even when choosing the 1/2 rice, 1/2 salad option however, if it's protein you're yearning for, you will be disappointed.  Our entrée had five chunks of chicken that were extremely challenging to cut.  The chicken was over cooked, dry, and lacked flavor. The chicken was difficult to eat and to be honest after two pieces I had enough.  The roasted tomato had an odd taste that is hard to describe.  It really was very bland and seemed to be over cooked. The salad consisted soley of iceberg lettuce and onions with a small cup of salad dressing. However, I did finish my salad because I did not like the rice, as it lacked any flavor.  The overall meal just wasn't very good and not what I expected.

Are You Serious.... Get Out of Here!   I'm so sorry to see that Aeillo's on Central closed their doors (some time back).  I never saw Aeillo's restaurant empty.  Every visit to Aeillo's was bustling, full of happy diners. With that being said I decided to head to Aiello's Salumeria Italian Deli on Thunderbird.  From the moment my lunch companions and I walked in the door, I felt right at home as the owner warmly welcomed us in.  When the staff referred to "pasta" as "macaroni" and "sauce" as "gravy" I knew I was in for a great lunch expeirence.  The staff and service at Aeillo's Salemeria Italian Deli was attentive and friendly, and the food was amazing.  The homemade focaccia bread was so good, I am certain I ate way too much of it so I wasn't able to finish my meal. The stuffed artichoke hearts, and spaghetti/meatballs were to die for! I didn't think it was possible to make a better meatball then my grandmother but I was wrong (forgive me grandma).  I definitely recommend this place and it has now become  one of my favorite spots.  In addition, to great food.  Aeillo's Salumeria Italian Deli, offers great lunch specials (2 cheese slices and a fountain drink for 5 bucks) ARE YOU SERIOUS!! GET OUT OF HERE!  If your ever in the area you have to give this place a try.

I have to admit ... I am really picky when it comes to Chinese food but I have to admit I LOVE this place! Been there for lunch/dinner maybe 20 times, and have never had a bad visit. The service borders on amazing. The food is good, and the portions are generous. You will have leftovers for days. You get so much food for your money  The prices are so inexpensive  for such quality/quantity/service, it will keep you coming back for more.  You have to try the crab puffs...pork fried rice.. and orange chicken.. they are to die for!!

Charbroiled Happiness  The Habit is several steps above your bigger, faster hamburger places and not the trendy, boutique burger places that have opened up in the past few years.   The Habit serves up great burgers, fries, shakes and even salads, but the star attraction at the Habit are the onion rings, they are to die for.  The Habit also offers sweet potato fries if regular potato fries aren't your thing.  However, do yourself a big favor and order the crunchy onion rings, with ranch dressing on the side, you won't be disappointed .  The burgers  at the Habit come dressed in different flavors, but always freshly made and worth the wait.  The Habitb has a condiment bar with peppers and pickles, and there is no extra charge for whatever you want on your burger (grilled onions, mushrooms, lettuce, tomato, etc.)   The Habit is very reasonably priced. The restaurants are very clean and the staff has always been extremely accomadating.   I would go here any day of the week over other fast food restaurants.

Not what I was expecting.  I, like so many others usually avoid, at all cost visiting the Department of Motor Vehicle.  The room is usually packed and I know I am in for a very long wait.  Today I had to go to the MVD.  Even though the room was packed and seating was limited I was in and out within 20 minutes.  I couldn't believe it.  I was antispating my usually hour+ wait however, to my surprise I was in and out in no time.  I'm not sure if I was just lucky.  Either way I think this will be the MVD station I will go to in the future.

Cheeseburger in Paradise   You cant judge a book by its cover.  The same can be said about Paradise Valley Burger Company, so don't let the strip mall fool you, these burgers are a little taste of paradise. So, if you're looking for a top notch, delicious, greasy burger, than Paradise Valley Burger is the the place for you.  Paradise Valley Burger is a small restaurant with indoor tables and a few additional tables outside on the sidewalk. The menu is on a grease board and changes daily with specials.    Everything at Paradise Valley Burger  is prepared to order.  You place your order, take a seat, and wait for your meal to be delivered. On this visit I ordered the cheeseburger with sweet potato tots.  The sweet potato tots were hot, crispy, seasoned perfectly, and very tasty, as was my burger.  You can't beat the price and quality of Paradise Valley Burger. If you haven't tried this place I highly recommend it and skip the national fast food chains. These burgers are delicious and the price is right.

This is, absolutely, my favorite Italian Ice Place!  This place is incredible.  This is not the usual  Italian ice you would pick up from the supermarket or the local chain ice cream shop.  There are an abundance of flavors at Rita's Ice Custard Happiness  On my first visit to Rita's I tried the lemon Italian ice.  I have to admit this Italian ice was just as good if not better the any I ever had back in New York. This Italian ice is made with all natural ingredients.  The lemon Italian ice was light, lemony, faintly sweet, and ultimately refreshing.    The quality of their product, coupled with a hard-to-fiind variety of flavors, and excellent customer service makes Rita's Ice

Firehouse Serves up good subs and salads.   First, I have to say the service at Firehouse Subs is great!  The staff welcomes you when you walk through the door.  On my first visit to Firehouse Subs (some time ago).  Upon arriving we were met by an employee handing out menus.  My co-worker and I were asked if it  was our first visit to Firehouse Subs and we said yes. The emoloyee went over the menu and recommended we try the smokehouse beef and cheddar brisket.  The sub was delicious.  After leaving we couldn't stop talking about how good the sub was. In fact we went right back to firehouse subs a few days later.   So if your hungry for a good sub at a great price, head over to firehouse.

Best Wine Selection   I was going to a small dinner party with some friends and wanted to bring a nice Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon to the dinner party.  So, a quick stop at Total Wine and More was in my future.  Total Wine and more is truly second to none, when shopping  for wine and spirts.  I planned  on making a quick trip however,  I stayed much longer then I anticipated.   Total Wine and More carries wines from every wine-producing region in the world and from every price range. It is easy to lose track of time as you walk down  the aisles admiring the selection .  In addition to wines I enjoy looking at the selection of beers that range from America's most popular to hard-to-find microbrews and imports.   It can be challenging at times to make a decision on what to purchase.   However, the staff at Total Wine and More are pleasant, accommodating, and very knowledgeable.  The staff will even offer suggestions, or direct you to your preferences.   If you haven't been to Total Wine and More, you should stop by.

Hidden Gem For Great Greek Food  Today, I had a 'hankerin' for some  Greek/Mediterranean food but had no clue where I should go.  So I turned to my fellow "yelpers" for help and after reading reviews I decided to head to George's Famous Gyros and Pasta.   Who would have guessed that this little hidden gem had great tasting Greek food.  George's is unassuming from the outside and even more so inside.  George's is small, the tables are plastic and there isn't much in the way of ambiance.  However, George is wonderful and so is  his food, which is always prepared fresh and is absolutely delicious.    George understands Greek food. I assume  growing up in Chicago, laid out a great foundation for this eatery. The Greek salad with gyro meat, burgers, and fries are excellent.  However, make sure to bring an appetite because the portions are large, easily enough for two.  After finishing a large lunch, and thinking to myself, I cant eat another bite.  Out of the coner of my eye I caught a glimpse of the baklava and it was impossible to pass up.   I had dessert on the brain.  I am so glad I decided to endulge.  The baklava was oozing with honey and had just the right amount of sweetness. A perfect ending to a great lunch.  Oh, did I mention the low prices and great service? George's is an incredible value for the high quality of food.  If you enjoy Greek/Mediterranean food and you're in the area, you should definitely stop by George's, you won't be disappointed.

So refreshingly delicious  We really enjoy Tropical Smoothie Café and are so glad there is a location close to home. My nephew, 11, asks to go there often and the smoothies are a great way to boost his fruit and veggie intake.   I usually get the "Island Green" smoothie, it's so refreshingly delicious. My nephew enjoys all of the fruit smoothies, especially the "Rockin Raspberry".  To be honest we usually don't eat at Tropical Smoothie Cafe very often but I highly recommend the loaded spinach salad or the Buffalo Chicken Wrap, both entrée's are tasty and fresh.   Service is excellent and as fast as can be when you are making smoothies to order. If you enjoy smoothies give Tropical Smoothie Cafe a try.

I have to say I was disappointed with the ambience - or lack thereof at Carlos O'briens. The decor is more "Cafeteria-Style". On our visit it was not busy so we were seated immediately and a large basket of chips and two kinds of salsa were promptly delivered to our table. I have had better salsa however, my lunch companion thought the salsa was good.  I ordered the chicken fundido as did my lunch companion. In what seemed like an impossibly short time our orders were placed in front of us. I have to say that the entrees served at Carlos O'briens are of very generous portions.  In fact,  there was enough there for two to share.  You definitely get your money's worth.  However, I really didn't care for the taste of the chicken fundido.  The chicken was very dry and the sauce didn't have much flavor.  On a positive note our server, was very attentive and wanted to make sure everything was to our liking.   .

Nice place to spend a few hours   There are those time when I enjoy just sitting outside or going for a walk and taking advantage of all the beauty Arizona has to offer and Desert Horizon Park is a great spot to do just that.   Desert Horizon park is lush with green grass, trees, and many amenities for the family to enjoy.  This is a great park to have a barbecue, and spend the day with family and friends.   After indulging in a great barbecue you can take advantage of the sports facilities.  Desert Horizon Park has baseball and softball fields, basketball court, sand-volleyball courts, jogging trails and a play area for toddlers. I enjoy the one mile fitness trail with exercise stations.  If you're in the area check stop by and and relax.

Soup For You  Recently, my friends and I went to  Zupas for lunch. Zupas resembles a cafeteria-style, with fresh salads, soups, and sandwiches. We were greeted at the door as a  employee passed out menus to view while waiting in line. I choose to create my own salad  (half salad) and it was delicious. Iceberg lettuce, chicken, apples, cranberries, asiago cheese, topped with cinnamon pecans and pomegranate dressing.  Oh did I mention Zupas gives bread and a chocolate covered strawberries with every order.   Zupas offers value deals. The choose two deal (sandwich,soup, or salad) is fairly priced but the sandwiches are pretty average tasting, nothing all that special.  Maybe that is because they are trumped by their delicious soup (chicken enchilada chili).   The service is friendly and quick with no lunch line hold up. Plenty of seating with  employees who happily picked up our empty plates.  An excellent option for a quick, or leisurely, lunch that won't put a dent in your wallet.

Chicken Fingers Don't Get Any Better Then This.    If you are a Chicken Finger  lover, like my nephew I encourage you to give Raising Canes a try. These Fried Chicken Fingers take a back seat to no one. Raising Canes boneless Chicken Strips and dipping sauce are hard to beat.    Raising Canes never-frozen chicken tenderloins are fryed-to-order and accompanied by the best dipping sauce known to man.  The meat stays juicy, none of the dryness problems that plague lesser variations of fried chicken strips. The Chicken Strip combo box is served with crinkle cut fries, Texas toast, and a side of coleslaw.  You have to try the fresh squeezed lemonade, it's the best.   Raising Canes has quick service and friendly staff, so if your in the mood for chicken fingers, head on over.

You can't beat the price.   You will want to eat  three or four of these street tacos to satisfy your craving, and at La Salsita there's never a  financial impediment in order to satisfy you hunger because these prices are very reasonable.  The carne asada, al pastor, and green chili beef  are top-notch. The tacos at La Salsita are served with a generous amount of  grilled meat piled on top of  delicious  housemade tortillas and topped off with cilantro and onions.  In addition to great tacos, La Salsita has some of the best chips and salsa around.  The chips are made to order and served piping hot.  The chips are hot, light, and crispy, there are a  meal in itself.  If your in the area and craving tacos you should stop by.  You won't be disappointed . Great food, reasonable prices, and friendly staff.  It doesn't get any better.

Zoyo Neighborhood Yogurt  I stopped by Zoyo Neighborhood Yogurt shop for a quick afternoon snack while in downtown Phoenix. The first observation that caught my attention was Zoyo's is clean, incredibly so. The Employees working at Zoyo's greet every customer who comes in the door, which I thought was a nice touch.   Once you enter you are given sample-size cups.  You can taste as many samples as you desire. The employees are very accommodating and ready to answer any questions you might have about the yogurt, the machines or the multitude of toppings.  Zoyo's yogurt is creamy and very tasty, with all the flavors Zoyo's has to offer, my decision wasn't going to be an easy one. I enjoyed two kinds of yogurt on my visit - Salted Carmel and Ultimate Cherry. I topped my yogurt with a variety of goodies, such as raspberry sauce, marshmallow cream, and chopped cashews.  My yogurt creation was amazing.  In addition to the amazing yogurt; Zoyo's has an outdoor sating area, roomy with plenty of seats and music.  So if you're in the downtown Phoenix area and craving a delicious treat stop by Zoyo's you won't be disappointed.  .

Gas and so much more.  QuikTrip is always a great choice when it comes to refueling.  I find it a challenge to just purchase "gas" when I visit a QuikTrip.  I like the soda fountain station, and the  multitude of snacks QuikTrip has to offer. I always manage to find a snack I hadn't had in quite some time, and it just calls my name.  In addition,  just like all quick trips this store is extremely clean, even more so then normal.   Reasonably priced gas, ice cold drinks, and snacks, it doesn't  get any better.

Not my usual stop.  This Starbucks is not my usual stop however, it just might be my favorite. I love my coffee and what's better then a Starbucks a iced white chocolate mocha, I can't think of anything.  The service at this Starbucks is phenomenal and the staff are always very friendly. This location is clean, inviting, and feels comfortable and they have seating outside at the patio, and wuth this cooler weather what a perfect option.  My coffee was made exactly the way I order and tasted great. In addition, to the great coffee Starbucks has delicious pastries if you need a snack. I really enjoy grabbing a cake pop or two to go.  Great coffee, pastries,  friendly staff, and shopping.  It doesn't get any better.

Great prices and selection.    If you have been to Winco in the past, then  you already know about the great prices and selection WinCo has to offer.  WinCo is a  good size grocery store with excellent prices.  Some of the prices at WinCo are better then Frys or even Walmart.  Winco is not an "Outlet" type store or a "Pay" for membership store.  WinCo  is a regular full selection grocery store with a deli, meat dept, bakery and florist and liquor department.  Winco is nicely laid out, clean, and the associates are friendly and helpul. I just wish I had a WinCo closer to the house.

No soup for you!   My friends and I enjoy going to lunch at Zupas  Cafe.  Zupas resembles a cafeteria style with fresh salads, soups, and sandwiches. Once you enter Zupas you are greeted at the door as an employee pass out menus to view while waiting in line.   I usually choose to create my own salad, well make that a  half salad and  it is always delicious. My salad creation consist of iceberg lettuce, chicken, apples, cranberries, strawberries, topped with cinnamon almonds and strawberry vingerette dressing.  Oh did I mention Zupas give a piece of bread and a chocolate cover cherry with every order.    Zupas offers great value deals. The choose 2 deal is  any sandwich, soup, or salad at a great price. I think the sandwiches are fair but that is only because they are trumped by the delicious varieties of soup.  Zupas will let you sample all their wonderful soups before you decide.  You have to try the vegetable chowder it is amazing.  So if you want a great bowl of soup give Zupas a try.

An insightfull and moving collection.   The Phoenix Police Museum might look small, however the museum is packed with intresting displays and historical information.  The museum has an area  where children can play in a real police car or on a 3 wheel ATV. In addition to the play area there is a display on the Miranda case, which we are all familiar with  "you have the right to remain silent..."  The museum has a memorial room dedicated  to those officers who have lost there life in the line of duty.  You don't have to be in law enforcement to enjoy this museum, it's a great museum for everyone, including young children.  I would recommend this museum to all.

At a loss for words  Today, was a typical summer day in Arizona. You know what I'm talking about, 110+ degrees and as your driving around town you decide an ice cold fountain drink is exactly what you need to get you through the day.    As I pulled into the parking lot of Circle K, my only thought was, maybe I should go to another store. The debris all over the parking lot should have been an indication of what the store would look like inside, and it was.  The floors were filthy, cups thrown all over the counters along with food  and other trash.  There were Flys around the fountain drink despenser.   I had to leave without buying anything.  I just couldn't do it.  This store was the worst I have even seen.

Excellent service makes all the difference.  Today I was visiting a friend from out of town.  I work in downtown Phoenix and I have  passed the  Hotel Palomar countless times but I never paid  attention to the beautiful property.   Hotel Palomar is located right in the heart of downtown Phoenix near the sports stadiums, restaurants and other downtown venues.  As you walk into the Palomar you are greeted with a sense of comfortableness and familiarity, it's as if you been a long time resident of the Palomar.  The Palomar is trendy and they have this amazing pool located on the 3rd floor of the hotel that overlooks downtown Phoenix.   I wish I had more time to explore the hotel.  I am sure there was a lot more to see.   The staff and concierge appear to be very  knowledgeable and friendly.  The Palomar seems to have everything you could ask for in a luxury hotel. A  convenient location, excellent customers service, beautiful clean rooms, and we'll  to many amenities to list.    I know where I will be staying the next time I want a vacation away from home.

A Little Treasure ... In Goodyear.. What Took Me So Long To Find This Place?  The incredibly unique flavors found at Yogurtini, is one of the reasons why Yogurtini is my favorite self serve frozen yogurt shop.   While I can go on and on about the frozen yogurt, the multitude of flavors, wide selection of toppings, in a self-serve environment which allows you to create your own frozen yogurt masterpiece.  The real draw of Yogurtini is the friendly staff! You are greeted from the moment you enter the store. Employees give you a few sample cups and if you want more  samples no problem ... just ask!   Yogurtini always have coupons in the local mailer, and offer a frequent customer program.  Did I mention Yogurtini is open late, for your late night cravings!

Always Fresh and Always good   I have always enjoyed eating at Pita Kitchen, the service is exceptional and you always leave wanting more.   The serving sizes are generous. Today, my friends and I ordered the hummus for an appetizer, and we split a few Chicken Chipotle Pita Wraps. If you like hummus at all, you need to try it, you won't be disappointed.  If hummus isn't for you Pita Kitchen offers a wide variety of entrée selections. There are  salads and great desserts.  The service is always friendly, courteous, and the food is always fresh and delicious.

Do not be fooled.   Don't be fooled by what appears from the outside to be a  hole in the wall.  Authentic fare, excellent prices, and good service is what you will find inside this hidden gem.  International House of Food is a no frills restaurant but it is squeeky clean and serves tasty dishes.  The owners work the counter and they are gracious and welcoming.  International House of food serves Breakfast, Chinese, and Mexican entrees it might sound like an odd collection of food but somehow it works. I was impressed with the Al pastor tacos. The meat was tender and flavorful and the tacos had a nice taste.  I think on my next visit I will try a breakfast entrée.   I am sure it will be as good as the tacos.

Nice choice for a quick meal   Potbelly's is a small sandwich shop with a relaxing, neighborhood vibe.  In fact, the day we went there was a man singing and playing guitar for the patrons.   Potbelly is my kind of sandwich shop.  Potbelly offers all the favorites, turkey, ham, meatball, italian mixed,by chicken and cheddar, tuna, chicken, and my favorite "the wreck".  Potbelly also serves  chili, soups, shakes and smoothies.  Potbelly aslo serves  "skinny" sandwiches with less meat for those watching their calorie intake.  The staff is friendly and accommodating and will offer suggestions if you like. Potbelly's is a nice choice for a quick meal.

Mechanics You Can Trust.  I have only positive praise for Brakes Plus. They take care of all of our cars from brakes, steering, alignments, timing belts, vacuum leaks, a/c, shocks and struts.  Beakes Plus keeps their customers  informed as to the status of the work being done on their vehicles and will never leave you inconvenienced for transportation.  The staff at Brakes Plus are friendly, professional, and knowledgable. They answer all of your questions and even provide options for what to do with repair or replacement issues. I have never question their honesty and integrity, and that is not easy to say for businesses these days. I would recommend this Brakes Plus to anyone in need of maintenance or repair on a vehicle. It's a reassuring feeling finding mechanics you can trust.

A great tasting tortillas.  If you enjoy Chipotle then you will Love Café Rio. Somewhat same concept, however Cafe Rio has much better food. The tortilla's are hand made and absolutely delicious. So is there fresh homemade guacamole. You have to try Cafe Rio's sweet barbocoa pork, it is amazingly tender and succulent.   Cafe Rio is an excellent Mexican Grille, that's quick, however Cafe Rio doesn't skimp on the big bold flavor. I prefer to get the taco salad with the pork barbacoa or green chili beef.  Make sure you try the house cilantro lime ranch dressing, a wonderful compliments for your salad.  Homemade tortillas, daily specials and fun atmosphere add up to a great place to eat. Reasonable pricing and great service.  Would recommend to anyone.

A different twist on Breakfast.  Park Cafe is a, niche type restaurant, and at least for us, offers the additional benefit of being locally owned. So if  you're looking for a different twist on breakfast, from a locally owned business, Park Cafe is a great place to go.  I visited  Park Cafe today to have brunch with my nephew.  I have been to Park Cafe several times and have never been disappointed.  At times, there can be a small wait for a table when the restaurant is busy, but that's not uncommon for any busy restaurant.   Park Cafe offers unique entrée's, like the Steak Chilaquiles, which are delicious, and a must try.   At times, there is a wait for your entree to arrive after ordering, however,  that's because the food at Park Cafe is cooked to order and not kept sitting on plates under warming lights, and for that reason alone it's worth the wait. However, you have the added bonus that the food at Park Cafe is really good, and we'll worth the wait.  The wait staff at Park Cafe are , accomdating, friendly, without being intrusive, and will offere helpful suggestions from the menu choices based on your preferences.  If your ever in the area, you should give Park Cafe a try, you won't be disappointed.

Good for kids.    Windy City Dogs features Vienna Beef hot dogs. This restaurant is local, and I like  to support small businesses.  I have spent some time in Chicago and have had my fair share of hotdogs.  At Windy City dogs you can get a traditional Chicago dog on a  poppy seeded bun, peppers, pickle spear, tomato slices, fluorescent green relish ?, chopped onion, and celery salt.  Windy City Dogs offers a  variety of toppings and if you don't like beef dogs, there is Polish sausage, tamales, corndogs, nachos, and Italian beef sandwiches. On this visit I had the tamale and to be honest it was very disappointing and nothing like tamales I am accustomed to.    Prices range from inexpensive to ridiculously cheap. This is a great place to bring kids, I myself am not a hot dog fan so I am trying to be very objective.  Eat in or take out, its up to you. Service is fast and friendly.

Cult Bagelry  I'm a native New Yorker, now living in Arizona.  I grew up starting my day with a roll & butter or my favorite a bagel with butter. I know what you're thinking, the same thought I had, simple find a great bagel shop in Arizona and start your day right.   Finding a ordinary bagel is easy, regardless of where you live. Finding a great bagel that's boiled, baked and given a generous schmear of  butter or cream cheese is tough in these parts, that is until I found Oasis Bagel.   The bagels at Oasis Bagel are fantastic.  My favorites are the Onion, Garlic, or Salt. These bagel are everything a bagel should be.  The bagel's are crispy, chewy, garlicky, onion-y, salty perfection.  On my next I plan on trying a sandwich. Especially, after I found out that at Oasis Bagel they use Boars Head Cold Cuts.  If you're ever in the area and want to taste  delicious bagels, and expeirebce great customer service, stop in.  You won't be disappointed.

One of the Best Fast Food Burgers Around.   Im not typically a burger person.  However, occasionally I get a craving and Five Guys always hits the spot.  Five Guys is a chain burger restaurant but unlike any other.  The burgers at Five Guys are always fresh,hot, and juicy.  The burgers are tender, tasty, and well seasoned. In addition, to great burgers are Five Guys Fries.  Do not order a large order of fries.  The large of fries  is not large it is enormous, it is a lunch bag full of fries.  My nephew, sister and I barely made a dent in them.  Five Guys burgers are the closest you will come to burgers you cooked yourself.  Five guys allows you to  customize your burger with cheese, bacon, grilled onions, mushroons, and to many other toppings to name.   If customizing your burger isn't enough, you can do the same with your drinks.  Five Guys soda fountain  has every coke product from mello yello to dasani water. You select your base soda and and then add flavors  like cherry, peach, or lime.  So you can customize your drink as much as your burger.      Prices are reasonable, employees are friendly and accommodating,  and the service is quick.

Nothing But Delicious   My family and I enjoy the bundtini's at Nothing Bundt Cake.  Recenty, my sister turned 29 again and I surprised her with a boxful of bundtini's.  The bundtini's at Nothing Bundt Cake are  bite-sized bundt cakes sold by the dozen.  You can select as many flavors as you want for your dozen,  making it easier to find your favorite flavor.    The white chocolate is my favorite flavor  however,  the chocolate chocolate chip is not far behind. The chocolate chip cake has mini chocolate chips in the cake and it is absolutely delicious.  Whether you purchase a large bundt cake, individual size, or the bundtini's  you will want more. The cake is moist, delicious, not overly sweet. Do yourself a favor and get some of these for your next special occasion, you won't regret it.

Gadzooks Enchiladas & Soup           "Just wasn't for me"   Gadzooks is a create-it-yourself restaurant with a hip and trendy vibe. Gadzooks offers enchiladas, tacos, chopped salads and house made tortilla soup. The staff at Gaszooks is accommodating, friendly, personable, and knowledgeable about the products they provide.  The atmosphere is stylish but very cramped.   I guess I was really expecting more, considering all the positive reviews I read and this is why I feel terrible for saying the food at  Gadzooks was bland and poorly executed. On my first visit to Gadzooks I had the two enchiladas meal. First you select a bread. I choose corn tortillas,  Next it was time to select a meat. I  went with the braised short ribs. After you select your meat your ready to add the enchilada sauce. I choose the "Christmas" red and green,  two distinct sauces. Then your creation is topped with cheese, and  there are a few cheeses to choose from. I tried the Chihuahua Cheese. The medium size deep dish is then placed into a brick oven to bake. I added a few extras like Uncle Rico's pico and scratch made crema.   To be honest the food just wasn't good. The enchiladas were bland and soupy. Even tho Gadzoooks offers numerous toppings, I think less is better. The enchiladas seem to be covered with as much cheese and sauce as possible and this took away form the flavor of the meat.  Gadzooks wasn't the worst food nor the best, just disappointing.      However ending on a positive note I LOVED their chips.

Capriottis's You haven't had a sandwich until you have a Capriottis  Capriotti's Sandwich Shop is definitely the place to go for a good bite to eat. I would recommend Capriottis to anyone who is searching for something beyond "Just a Sandwich Shop". Capriottis is very clean and warmly decorate. The Staff is knowledgeable and very friendly.  On my first visit to Capriottis I had the "Bobbie" which is one of Capriottis signature sandwiches and for good reason.  The Bobbie is stuffed full of homemade turkey (that's right, homemade roasted turkey, not processed deli meat), cranberry sauce, stuffing, and mayo. The 'Bobbie" sandwich was amazing to say the least.  If turkey isn't for you Capriotti's offers a variety of traditional deli sandwiches, cheese-steaks, as well as specialty sandwiches.  I plan on trying the cheese steak on my next visit.  The service at Capriottis is always fast & friendly. The atmosphere reminds me of that of a small-town deli sandwich shop and the food is always consistent and great.  I could keep writing everything I enjoyed but I think I have given you enough to try Capriotti's for yourself! Who knows maybe I will see you there!

Trendy, Relaxing, and Really Good Food!   The Culinary Dropout was recommended by a friend and is a Fox Restaurant Concept, generally known for more upscale type establishments.  The atmosphere at Culinary Dropout  is really trendy and cool, even our server had a cool name "Slade". We decided to eat outside in order to avoid a wait and to take advantage of one of the rare occasions when you can eat on the patio in Phoenix, Arizona, in August.  My friends and I were famished, so we opted to order some of the house-made potato chips and the pretzels with provolone fondue.  Both of these appetizers were excellent.  I couldnt get enough of the pretzels, and if I hadn't had an entree coming, I probably would have polished off the whole order by myself.  As an entree I ordered the chicken club sandwich which came with a chicken breast, ham and bacon.  It was quite good.  My lunch companions had the meatloaf, fried chciken, and mac & cheese burger and they were equally delicious.  The service was perfect-our server was friendly and there at the right time every time.  We will definitely come back again.

Great Selection   I'm usually not a fan of outlet malls, however, I enjoy shopping at Tanger Outlets.  I was able to finish a lot of Christmas shopping this season, in one location, especially at the Under Armour Store.  The prices at Under Armour were very reasonable and there was a large selection of merchandise to choose from.  All the products I purchased were of great quality, fit, durable, breathable, stylish and nothing I purchased shrunk. Definetly, a standard of an under armour product.  My nephew was very pleased as was I with the hoodies and t-shirts we purchased.  The sales associates are extremely helpful and quick to offer assistance and advise. I would definitely recommend stopping by to see what Under Armour has to offer.

A pleasant experience and professional staff  Great service, I went to FastMed Urgent Care with for a rash on my arm.  I wasn't sure how long I would have to wait, we all know how busy urgent care can be.  I signed in and filled out  the required paperwork.  The waiting room had a few people however I was called back very quickly.  After taking my vitals I went into a patient room and the doctor arrived a few minutes later. After speaking with the doctor I was given my prescription and discharge instructions and was out the door faster then I imagined, not a bad deal for urgent care.  The staff is friendly and helpful and doctors can address any concerns you have.  When your primary care physician isn't available this is the place to go.  If you ever find yourself in need of medical care and want great service from professional health care providers who are dedicated to your wellness, look no further.

Never Noticed  I have driven by The Stand dozens of times but never noticed this little gem of a restaurants.  However, today the bright neon sign immediately caught my attention. So, my lunch companion  and I thought it might be a good place to stop and have lunch.  The menu at The Strand is simple and straightforward, one burger, a few tacos, sides, drinks, and shakes. On this visit I had  two Braised Short Rib tacos, and fries. My lunch companion had the "The Standard", that's what they call their burger with fries.  The braised short rib tacos were delicious. I thought the taco would would be the typical street taco, however the pickled onion, cabbage, adds something your typically Street Taco doesn't have, and made for a delicious taco. My lunch companion said the burger was delicious as well and the fries are fresh cut, not frozen, crispy, and were absolutely the best  The staff at The Strand are friendly and attentive. There is very limited seating inside and they have a enclosed covered patio outside (not cooled) similar to the  burgers stands you would see by the beach. Can you enjoy Burgers and Tacos you should give this trend a try. The food was fresh, delicious, and reasonably priced.

Wish I  of found this place  years ago.   You'd never know it from the store front but if your looking for a great breakfast look no further.    Matt's is great. The staff is accommodating, the food is amazing, and the prices are very reasonable. The quality of the ingredients is evident in every bite. Matt's takes breakfast to a new level.  Matt's Big Breakfast is just that..BIG..  Matt's serves Classic breakfast food with a twist of unique combinations and freshness.  On my first visit I had the salami and eggs, home style potatoes  with sourdough toast and homemade peach preserves. All I can say about the peach preserves (which is made daily at Matt's) is   AMAZINGLY ADDICTING.  Try it Your taste buds will thank you.  So if you love breakfast like I do  give Matt's BIG Breakfast a try.

Once is not enough  Today, I decided I wanted Sushi for lunch and was told by a coworker that Sushi Brokers served the best tasting Sushi in Phoenix.  Initially, I was skeptical because I am very particular when it comes to Sushi, but I decided to give Sushi Brokers a try and I am so glad I did.  Unlike most sushi restaurants that have very limited seating at the bar, Sushi Brokers understands it's more fun to watch the chefs arrange their delicious creations and  have plenty of seating at the bar.   My lunch companions and I feasted on Cowgirl Sushi Rolls, Crunchy Rolls, Surfer Rolls, Lollipop Rolls, and spicy edamame. All our entrée's were fresh and absolutely delicious.  My favorite was the Cowgirl rolls which are made with Yellowtail, layered on top of a Sushi roll, with Spicy Hot Sauce on top.   The sushi was fresh, delicious and artfully presented. The atmosphere inside Sushi Brokers is inviting and, a bit upbeat. The service at Sushi Brokers can be a little slow however, we enjoyed our visit and the clientele  are very friendly. You can't go wrong at Sushi Brokers.

The most important meal of the day.  As the old adage goes "Breakfast is the most important meal of the day". I have to admit, Breakfast is my favoite meal of the day. However,  Breakfast places have a tendency to be either hit or miss.  Today was my first visit to the Original Breakfast House (OBH) and it was a hit. OBH is cooking up breakfast right. OBH offers creative  unique entrée's and old time favorites, and you can substitute or add on to any entrée selection.  On my first visit I ordered scramble eggs, homestyle fried potatoes, and a side of pancakes, all were delicious. OBH even serves deep fried French toast which looked delicious, I plan on trying the french toast on my next visit .   In addition to great food OBH has great customer servicr. OBH has an old diner feel with great music. The servers are friendly and seem really concerned that you enjoy your  meal and leave happy and full.   So if your ever in the area, stop by OBH, you won't be disappointed.

Nice place to grab a bite to eat.   Everybody's Neighborhood Grill is small and unassuming.  You place your order at the front counter, take a seat, and wait for your entrée to arrive.    The staff at Everybody's Neighborhood Grill are friendly, accomdating, and the prices are reasonable. On this visit my lunch companion and I had the Beef Brisket & Hot link platter, Macaroni and Cheese, potato salad and corn bread.  The Beef Brisket was tender, moist, and absolutely delicious as was the Macaroni & Cheese and Corn Bread. I wasn't a fan of the potato salad and the hot link was flavorful but to hot for me. However, my lunch companion said it was one of the best he has ever had.  I enjoy supporting local business and plan on going back to Everybody's Neighborhood Grill soon to try the ribs. If  you're looking for tasty, affordable BBQ stop by Everybody's Neighborhood Grill you won't be disappointed.  However be prepared to wait it took 30 to 40 minutes for our entrée to arrive. Service although good seems to be on the slow side.

Nike...Nike...and more Nike.  I have visited the Nike Factory Outlet Store once before and was pleased with my purchasing expeirence. Thr prices cant be beat. So If you're planning on purchasing a bunch of Nike gear, the Tanger Factory outlet store is worth the drive.  The Nike Factory Outlet Store at Tanger Outlets offer a variety of merchandise in assorted colors and sizes, so you'll be sure to find what you're looking for. What I appreciate the most about the Nike Factory Outlet Store are the sales.  You are always able to find sales from 20, 30, to 40% off the already low price.   Great prices, convenient location, and great customer service is worth checking out.

Fantastic lunch combos! I enjoy going to Di Carlo's. I usually get the pizza, but I've tasted their pizza rolls, lazanga, calzone and salads and their good also. If you can eat there for lunch rather than getting your food to go, Di Carlo's offers several awesome lunch specials that always satisfy and the staff is friendly and accomadating.   The lunch specials are a great deal however, my favorite item will always be the pizza rolls.  These pizza rolls are large, made to order, stuffed with pepperoni and provolone cheese and  served with freshly made marinara sauce for dipping.   A four piece order cost only $4.99, can't beat that price.  So if your in the neighborhood, stop by and get an order to go.

Don't Judge a Book by its Cover   RC Heaven and Hobby Shop looks like a nice little shop from the outside. Once you walk inside RC Heaven you can't help but notice thst the place is wall to wall R/C Cars, Trucks, Buggies, Planes and More. This little store has a large selection of RC's items.  I am the first to admit my lack of knowledge when it comes to RC cars.  However, the staff at RC Heaven are very knowledgeable and if they don't know the answer, they will be honest and tell you and find someone who does. The prices seem to be average and much better than you can find on the internet and the folks at RC Heaven are  willing to cut deals. In fact, when my nephew didn't have enough for the RC car he wanted, he was given a 30% discount! Now that's what I call great customer service.   So if your every in the area, stop by and take a look around. You won't be disappointed .

Perfectly Fine  I am so glad I stumbled onto US Egg on Bell Road.  What a terrific find this was for breakfast.  One thing I truly appreciate about US Egg,  there is "No Waiting" you're always greeted and seated immediately.    US Egg has plenty of seating with a full and friendly staff ready to accomdate your every need .  US Egg offers an extensive menu for breakfast with all your breakfast favorites. Your entree is prepared as you ordered and the portions are large.   I would highly recommend US Egg for breakfast, especially if you're really hungry. Whatever you like: egg dishes, pancakes, waffles, etc. they have it. Tip: if you're not a hearty eater, ask for a half-size portion. It's still a lot of food.

These Tacos Pack A Punch  I am a self-proclaimed Mexican food junkie. However, I am spoiled.  Having lived  in the southwest, where we tend to, critique our Mexican Cuisine harshly at times. As for.me, I demand high-quality Mexican food, that is well-prepared, and well-seasoned, and America's Taco doesn't disappoint. I have eaten at America's Taco at least a dozen times at various locations and all locations served delicious food.   America's Taco offers a small menu and an even smaller seating area however, the food is really good. America's Taco is a no frills establishment.  You place your order at the counter, take a seat, and your entrée is brought to your table.   I have tried many of the menu items at America's Taco and have never been disappointed.  America's Taco Shop has some of the best Carne Asada I have found in the Phoenix Metro Area. However,  as delicious as the Carne Asada is, my favorite are the Tacos Al Pastor.  These tacos are just so savory. The Tacos Al Pastor are street style tacos, served on corn tortillas, with sweet and tangy pork, fresh cilantro, and pineapple, these tacos pack quite a punch. I enjoy the Taco Trio (a Chicken, Al Pastor, Carne Asada).  If you find yourself in the area, you should stop by, you won't be disappointed.

I am not what most people would consider a "big gambler" not even when I go to  Vegas.  However, I have been wanting to visit Vee Quiva for quite some time and I am so glad I did because I had a great time.     My friends and I ate at Ditka's.  We had the Prime Rib (Very tasty). Ditka's restaurant has a wonderful atmosphere and the service is excellent.    Ditka's fine dining offers happy hour prices starting at 5 PM in the bar,  $3 beer/wine and $5 martini's.  Most of the appetizers are also happy hour priced at mere $5.00. We enjoyed filet magnon sliders, calamari, and pot roast nachos.  Vee Quiva has a 24/7 cafe/restaurant with a great $4 breakfast served all the time. Vee Quiva has a nice pool, beautiful rooms, giant  flat screen TV's in each room, covered parking, lots of slots, table games, and a food court with Dunkin Donuts, Fat Burger, Panda Express, Mexican tortas.  So If your ever in the area you should stop by.

There are problems only ice cream can fix.  Melt is located in a artsy and quirky  part of downtown Phoenix, that is refered to as Roosevelt Row. The area is filled with art galleries, vintage shops, and book stores, it's worth a stop just to look around  if you're in the area.  As we walked into Melt we were greeted, asked if it was our first visit, and given as many samples as we wanted.  Melt has a  display case  which is stocked with 18 flavors of  ice cream, which are all made locally at  Superstition Farm in Mesa.  Melt has all the standard flavors and lots of creative  flavors, like fruity pebbles.  The flavor selection at Melt is always rotating so there is always something new.  On my first visit I had the super farm, chocolate, hazelnuts, with nutella swirled in.  The ice cream was delicious and perfecy sweet. And the scoop.size is large. At Melt you can choose to have your ice cream served in Chinese takeout boxes and topped with a fortune cookie, between two cookies, or in a house-made waffle cone.  The prices are reasonable, the customer service is great, and most importantly the ice cream is delicious.  If your in the mood for really good ice cream give Melt a try you won't be dissapointed.

Just wasn't what I thought it would be.    Maybe it was just a bad day or maybe I selected the wrong entrée but unfortunately I did not like the food at AJK Chinese Cusine . The entrée's just weren't what I thought they would be.  The sesame chicken that we ordered was completely bland, the mongolian beef did not seem fresh, and the lo mein and fried rice were greasy and lacked any taste.   I honestly think you can get same or better quality food at Panda Express.

Disappointed    The Fry Bread House is an unpretentious spot serving fry bread, burritos, tamales, and various other items.  I use to be a huge fan of the Fry Bread House.  However, lately the food has been somewhat disappointing. My lunch group and I were looking for a spot to grab a quick bite to eat. After noticing that the parking lot at the Fry Bread House was  full we decided to give it another shot. After all with that many cars in the parking lot the food had to be good.   However, our lunch was a disaster. The Fry Bread we ordered was soggy, greasy, and lacked any real flavor . My lunch companion ordered green chili and it ended up being the worst green chili she had ever received - and that was after sending it back because the original order was wrong.   My other lunch companion had the red chili fry bread, he said it was okay, but nothing special. I would recommend trying somewhere else.

Always a good choice.  Always a favorite  A bucket of peanuts and  a basket of hot bread, served with cinnamon butter from the moment you sit down.  How could it get any better than that?  Well it could get much better if you remember to get to Texas Roadhouse before 6 p.m for the early bird specials.  I had steak and rib dinner, my sister had the sirloin, and my nephew had the chicken critters. The portions at Texas Roadhouse are large and cooked to perfection.   The ribs were fall off the bone tender and delicious.  The next time I go back I'll have to bring my rib eating friends. The steak was so tender,  it really was like cutting butter.    Great food, great prices, and amazing customer service.  If you enjoy a good steak stop by Texas Roadhouse you won't be disappointed.

A Great Pie.  I'm originally from NY, and it's always a challenge to find a great Italian Pie. I have eaten lots of pies at  lots of pizzerias, and I have  to say that Spinato's Pizzeria is one place that serves up a delicious  pies.  Spinato's is Not just another pizzeria; they have a full menu and a product line with sauces and salad dressings. Today, I was fortunate enough to have tried Spinato's for the first time at a Holiday Party and I can't praise the food enough.    I tend to be picky when it comes to pizza pie and Spinato's doesn't disappoint. The crust on Spinato's pizza pie is thin, and the sauce is perfectly sweet (no acidic taste). The toppings go completely to the edge of the pie and the pizza is cut into squares. These pies are the perfect combination of sauce, toppings, and crust.  In addition to Spinato's delicious pies, Spinato's offers great salads. I really enjoyed the Strawberry Gorgonzola Salad made with fresh baby spinach, strawberries, candied pecans, and gorgonzola.  The ravioli, meatballs, sausage, and chicken Alfredo,  were also delicious.  Spinato's will be added to my list of  favorite pizzerias.

My coffee is always made the way I order and tastes great. In addition, to great coffee Starbucks has delicious pastries if you need a snack.  Great coffee, pastries,  friendly staff, and shopping.

Great Service Will Keep Me Coming Back.   As I was driving I noticed that my tire had low  air pressure.  I wasn't sure if my tire had a leak or just needed some air.  I was close to Goodyear Auto Service Center and decided to stop and have my tire checked.  It was close to closing time, so I wasn't sure what kind of service I would receive. After just  few minutes, I was no longer concerned about the type of service I would receive.  The folks at Goodyear Auto Service Center are professional, knowledgeable, and concerned about their customers. It turns out I had a huge nail in my tire.  The nail was removed, the tire was repaired, and I was back on the road in no time.  Goodyear Auto Service Center displayed a level of customer service  seldom seen these days. The sales force is knowledgeable and can make solid suggestions if you give them sufficient information as to your needs. I am so glad I stopped by.

Somewhat disappointed   Today I Went to the Cafe Rio Mexican Grill for lunch. The restaurant was crowded, however people were moving through the cafeteria style line and receiving their entrée's very fast.   At Cafe Rio, you select the type of food you want to eat, add the meat, beans, sauces, and extras according to your own preferences.  Everything is fresh and prepared in front of you. The tortillas at Cafe Rio are made to order so I knew I was going to order a burrito because I really enjoy homemade tortillas.  As your looking at the menu it seems as if you are being hurried through the serving line.  On my first visit I ordered  a sweet pork burrito with, cheese, black beans, rice and salsa.  As you place your order, the food is passed down the cook line and tossed behind  onto a conveyor belt which runs your entrée through an oven.   To be honest I was somewhat disappointed in the quality and taste of the food.  My entrée had an overwhelming taste of salt, it was all I could taste.  The burrito just wasn't very good.  I assumed that Cafe Rio would be another version of Chipoltle because the serving style and food items are very similar but I think I prefer Chipoltle.   To end on a postive note Cafe Rio is clean, well decorated, and the employees are friendly and very accommodating.

Amazing Food and Service  Blanco Tacos  + Tequila was recommended by a friend and is a Fox Restaurant Concept, generally known for more upscale type establishments.  The atmosphere at Blanco Tacos  is really trendy and cool. Blanco Taco is an open restaurant and can get loud at times however, I enjoy the energy inside the restaurant.   Our server  suggested the short rib enchilada and short rib tacos.  Both entrée's were fantastic.  The enchiladas are served inside a hot pan with melt in your mouth short ribs.  The short rib tacos are served with black beans or charro beans, rice, which was served with white corn and are some of the best tacos I've ever had. If you make your way to Blanco Tacos  you have to sample the guacamole it is fresh and absolutely delicious.    The house margarita's are good, esoecially the orange blood. Fresh food, great drinks, incredible outside seating area and very friendly wait staff make Blanco Taco + Tequila a great dining experience.

Breakfast the most important meal of the day.  Its been said that breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and Ollie Vaughn's is probably one of the best places for breakfast in town. Not only is the service and food fantastic at Ollie Vaughn's but, where else can you get a delicious, made from scratch breakfast for $6 bucks.  I love the biscuits and gravy at Ollie Vaughn's, however the French toast is always a good choice.  The french toast is thick, crispy, and fluffy light in the middle, just like French Toast should be.  On my next visit I plan on trying the "build-your-own breakfast sandwich" which are also made to order. You can choose between a croissant or a biscuit,  then you get to load it up with your choice of meat, cheese, and veggies.   So if your searching for the most  important meal of day that won't be break the bank look no further Ollie Vaughn's is the place for you.

I've past Conn's on  several different occasions but I never stopped to see what Conn's had to offer,  that is until my sister decided to buy a new livingroom set and a washer and dryer.  We were greeted by Orlando who allowed us the opportunity to  look around the store freely without any sales pitches or pressure to purchase.  Orlando was very informative and helpful without being intrusive.   Conn's offers a wide variety of furniture and appliance however, its priced slightly higher then other furniture stores in the area.  Our purchasing experience was pleasant.  I wish I could say the same about the delivery expeirence.    The delivery service called and advised that our furniture would be delivered on Monday between 9 and noon. We asked for a later delivery time and was advised that there were no other times available.  After waiting 30 minutes on hold to speak with a supervisor we were guaranteed that our delivery would be on Tuesday between 2 and 5.   Monday night I receive a phone call that my furniture would be delivered between 9 and noon. Once again I have to wait and speak to a supervisor and was advised that my furniture will now have to wait until Wednesday to be delivered.  I understand that the delivery service is separate from Conn's, however, it does have a bearing on my decision to shop at Conn's again.

If you like Italian Ice ... you should give Joe's a try.   I am so glad a friend told me about Joes Italian Ice. These italian ices are very close to what you get in the city (I think the Italian Ices at Joe's might be better).  I grew up in New York and have always enjoyed Italian Ices.  So, when I hear about italian ices in my area, its a pretty good bet I am going to stop and give it a try.    The decor at Joe's  is like a old soda shop.  The servers are friendly and they offer samples of any flavor you want to taste. My nephew and I  sampled just about everything in the shop before we made our final choices.  On my first visit I went with the Bada Bing Black Cherry and my nephew had the vanilla custard.  My black cherry ice was so good.  I wouldn't have shared if I hadn't wanted to try my nephews vanilla custard.  The Italian ice was sweet, refreshing,  with bits of real fruit inside. It was absolutely delicious as was the vanilla custard.   I will be sure to go back. There are so many flavors I can't wait to sample.

If you build it they will come.  Finially, the time has arrived, a local brewery in the West Valley, and their name is "Peoria Artisan Brewery", and these folks are here to stay.  Peoria Artisan Brewery  is located in a quiet area of Litchfield Park, an area that one would never think of to look for a brewery.  Located on a side street off Old Litchfield Road, Peoria Artisan Brewery is easy to miss (for those who aren't familiar with the Litchfield Park Area).  I have been to Peoria Artisan Brewery twice and the second visit was just as satisfying as the first. I have to admit.  Initially, my thoughts were, I'm really not a craft-beer person.  However, after just one visit to Peoria Artisan Brewery I can honestly say, "I left converted." I can now proudly say "I am a craft-beer person".  As you walk into Peoria Artisan Brewery you're  greeted immediately by the bartender and the owner.  The staff is friendly, accommodating, and extremely knowledgeable.  On this visit I started with one flight of 4 beers. I samapled the Haboob Black IPA, Paul's Pale, Artisan Amber, and the Superior Chocolate Stout.  All of which were so good that I  had to get another flight to try some more. Needless, to say the Fields Forever, Day at the Park, Angus Boy Scottish Ale, and Savannah Marie IPA were of superior taste and quality.  I was pleasantly surprised that all the craft- beers on tap were of excellent quality and taste.  Usually, when visiting a brewery there is always one if not two craft-beers that are not particularly satisfying.  However, that's not the case with Peoria Artisan Brewery.  I can honestly say, I really enjoyed everything on tap .   If your ever in the area or looking for a quality brewery stop by Peoria Artisan Brewery you will not be disappointed.

Great tasting Burritos ... you won't be disappointed.   PHX Burrito House is located off the beaten path in the Phoenix area.  I wanted a burrito for lunch and based on my fellow "yelpers" reviews I thought I would give the PHX Burrito House  a try and I was very glad I did.   All I can say is don't judge a book by its cover.  From the outside this burrito joint looks like an old house and if you aren't paying attention you will miss it and you don't want to miss this place.  Service is order at the register, then they bring your entrée to you. Customer service was really good, friendly and pretty quick.   There is a very good selection of burritos, tacos, and other popular dishes and all are reasonably priced and they taste great.  PHX Burrito house is not a fast food joint, so you get freshly made burritos that are a really good size and they are made with fresh tortillas that are absolutely delicious. The meat is tender and so flavorful. If your in the area you ha email to try this place you won't be dissapointed.

Crisp....Tasty....Delicious....looks like crepes for dinner.  I had to try this place spotting it after finishing up some grocery shopping. On my first visit, I ordered the Tropical ( pineapple, coconuts, & nuts) and Chipotle (cheese, ham & spinach). Both crepes were absolutely delicious.  These crepes were everything a crepe should be, light, crispy,delicate, soft, and full of flavor.  Ordering is done at a counter and the food is delivered to the table. It is definitely a very casual and comfortable neighborhood eatery. I sat at a window table and just watched people passing.  The staff is friendly and very warm and  accommodating.

Nice place to skate   Having grown up in the northeast portion of the country skating in the desert can be  an interesting concept. I wanted to take my nephew and get some ice skating in while on vacation and that's when I found AZ Ice Peoria.  AZ Ice has two rinks.  The south rink is olympic sized, and the north rink is just slightly smaller.    AZ Ice is a great place to have a tournament or be a spectator.  There is viewing in bleacher style seating and the facility is comfortable and clean throughout.  However, the ice at times isn't in the best condition. A couple of times around the rink and you soon find out what ice to stay away from.  The location was easy to find, slightly difficult to get into the first time.  AZ Ice may not be  Rockefeller Center however,  it does the job for us Phoenicians.

Look for the Windmill   Dutch Brothers has found the friendliest, most energetic emoloyess to work at their shops, considering they have to be up so early in the morning.  Their service at Dutch Bros was great; every employee was like a long lost friend.   Their coffee and smoothies at Dutch Bros are delicious, but I think it's the customer service that  will keep me coming back for more. I had the Mango smoothie and my nephew had the not so hot coca, both drinks were delicious.  My smoothie was light, sweet, and refreshing (would have taken a picture but I drank it to quick).    If you want your drink customized  just ask, Dutch Bros will take care of it. I like that Dutch Bros  has  "less hot" options for kids (my nephew liked the fact that the  hot chocolate didn't burn his mouth).  You might want to give Dutch Bros a try if your in the area.

Great tacos and you can't beat the price.   You might need three or four of these street tacos to fill you up, but at 1.50  each, there's no financial impediment in order to satisfy you hunger.  The carne asada, al pastor, and green chili beef  are top-notch. The tacos at Lazaro's are served with a generous amount of  grilled meat piled on top of  double housemade tortillas and topped off with cilantro and onions. Order them up grande or street-size, they are delicious.   In addition to great tacos, Lazaro's has some of the best chips and salsa around.  The chips are made to order and served piping hot.  The chips are hot, light, and crispy, there I meal in itself.  If your in the area and craving tacos you should stop by.  You won't be disappointed .

Wish I would have found this place years ago.  You never know from the store front but if you're looking for a great breakfast, then look no further, Matt's is the place for you.  The staff at Matt's is accommodating, the food is amazing, and the prices are very reasonable.  The quality of the ingredients  is evident in everybite. Matt's takes breakfast  to a new level.   Matt's big breakfast, is just that, big. Matt's serves classic breakfast food with a  twist of unique combinations.   Today I had salami  and eggs, homestule potatoes, sourdough bread with homemade peach preserves.  All I can say about the peach preserve is it was absolutely delicious and it's made at Matt's daily.  If your looking for a great breakfast at a reasonable price give Matt's a try.

A nice little find.   I  discovered Wok Wei  Asian Cuisine when I was searching for a Chinese restaurant on the West Side of town .  I thought to myself,  who would know of a good place to grab a quick bite to eat, the answer was simple, my fellow "yelpers" and my fellow "yelpers" were right Wok Wei Asian Cuisine was a nice little find.  From the time we entered the restaurant and received a warm welcome to the "Please come again" as we left out experience at Wok Wei was very pleasant. The menu offers a wide choice of dishes wuch includes lunch and dinner specials.  All the food is fresh and excellent tasting, and the portions are large, I mean really large.  You get a great deal for your money!  The service is very fast and friendly. Wok Wei has both booths and tables and they have take out. Finally a good Asian restaurant in the west valley that is going to stay around.

Great Donuts.... Great Section    Daily Donuts can  put most other chain  donut shops to shame, particularly those grocery chains.   The Donuts at Daily Donut are made fresh every day is evident in every single bite.  Daily Donuts is so popular that you can reasonably expect to find some donuts  sold out, or at least low on stock.   Daily Donuts are packed with sweet flavor. I just cannot recommend this place enough. Daily Donuts is a must-visit anytime of the day .

Doing it right  I had been reading positive reviews about Mother Bunch Brewing for quite a while but hadn't had the opportunity to stop by and see for myself, that is until today.    Mother Bunch Brewing has a very inviting and comfortable atmosphere.  The staff are friendly, welcoming, and the service borders on amazing. You can chat with the staff, ask questions about food and beer and receive  recommendations based on your preferences.  Mother Bunch Brewing offers a  plethora of local beers on tap, including some of their very own. If you enjoy a great porter or appreciate a hearty IPA,  Mother Bunch Brewing has something for everyone. On this visit  we sampled  the Amber, Vanilla Oatis, Orange Blossom, Tangerine Wheat and a Coffee Stout. All the beers were absolutely fabulous.  The food at Mother Bunch Brewing is as good as their beer.  We shared a Rueben,  3 alarm burger, Tri-tip and Sriracha Mac'n'Cheese, which was absolutely delicious. The servings are large at Mother Bunch Brewing, and we were really full. However, that didn't stop me from ending the night with a sweet treat. The MB Stout Brownie was so good. This brownies was gooey deliciousness, served warm and topped with vanilla bean gelato. I can't wait to have another.  If you're looking for great food, beer, service, and atmosphere  you have to try Mother Bunch Brewing.

Buying a new vehicle can be such a stressful experience but not if you go to Camelback Hyundai. I would like to thank the folks at Camelback  for giving me a great car buying experience.  Mark S and Curtis made purchading my new vehicle a truly quick and easy process. I was able to purchase the car I wanted for the price I wanted. I appreciate how helpful and respectful the staff at Camelback was to me and I would definitely recommend Camelback to anyone. If I am ever in need of another car I will definitely come visit you guys again!

Nice little find.  This was my first visit to Christina's. I have spent some time in central America and each country his it's own unique food styles and flavors.  Christina's is of Salvadorian origin, and they serve  Pupusa (corn tortillas filled with either cheese, beans, chicharon, loroco or mixed) and the pupusa at Christina's are delicious and at a mere $2 each, it doesn't get much better.  You have to top your pupusa with repollo (cabbage salad) and tomota sauce; its a meal in themselves. My lunch companion had the beef flatas, Rice, and beans.  The flatas were good but the rice and beans were somewhat bland. However, in all fairness rice and beans are not one of my favorites choices.  The atmosphere at Christina's is realxing, the waitstaff is very friendly and acomdating, and the food was good. Christina's is a definite must if you appreciate good Latin food for a reasonable price.

Very disappointing  I hate giving a restaurant with positive reviews a bad rating so let's start this review off on a positive note.  The service at Taco Mich is quick and the staff is very accomdating, which is why I  feel terrible for saying their food is  bland and poorly presented.     Taco Mich food isn't so much bad as it is bland, and the presentation of their entrées are, I hate to say sloppy and unappetizing. Today my lunch companion and I ordered the taco dish combo and to be honest it just did not taste very good, and the food was lukewarm at best. The color of the beans, rice, and meats are all muted together somewhat like bad cafeteria food.  The tacos were topped with a  combination of cheese, lettuce, and tomatoes  but it all tasted greasy.   I'm not in a rush to visit Taco Mich anytime soon. I feel that  unpleasant flavors are worse than no flavor at all.

Don't judge a book by its cover.   I guess the saying must be true "You can't judge a book by its cover".  The  exterior at Alfonso's is unassuming, the restaurant is very clean, the service is efficient, and I cannot say enough about the food.  Alfonso's Mexican Food is a delicious surprise.    Alfonso's offers a large variety of great menu choices. Alfonso's does not have table service, so you order your entrée  at the counter, pick up your food, and take it to your table.  The food is not what you would call "fast" food but carefully prepared food would be a better choice of words.  On this visit I had the shredded beef and ground beef tacos and both were really very good and seasoned perfectly. My lunch companion had the Carne Asada Burrito and he said it was the best he's ever had. The burritos at Alfonso's are huge, inexpensive, and most important, delicious.   If your ever in the area stop by Alfonso's. The food is authentic and will not disappoint.

Who says you can't find fresh fish in the valley.  If you're a fan of Fish & Chips, then ADA 's should be your next stop.  I went to ADA'S Fish Fry  on the recommendation of of  my fellow "yelpers" and I am so glad I did.  ADA'S is a wonderful, family-owned fish & chips restaurant. The fish is fresh, delicious and served with a smile.  On my first visit I selected the lunch combo. The lunch combo came with 2 big pieces of fish, a large portion of homemade fries, coleslaw, sauce, and a drink.   The fish is a delicious flaky,meaty, white fish, and the breading is a light tasty mix of flour, cornmeal, and seasoning.   The fish is light, crunchy, cooked perfectly, served hot with the best homemade French fries in town.   The lunch combos run about $8.50 and the portions are absolutely huge.    I am excited  to have finally found a fresh seafood restaurant in the West Valley. The guys behind the counter were very welcoming and accomdating. The quality of the food is top notch. I will definitely be back soon.

Just Not For Me  The staff at Don Taco/Taqueria Tacubaya are warm, friendly, and extremely accommodating, which is why I feel terrible for calling out their Mexican food as bland. I really wanted to like Don Taco/ Taqueria Tacubaya so badly, especially after reading so many positive reviews. However, the food in my opinion just isn't good.  This was my first visit to Don Taco/Taqueria Tacubaya  Mexican Food Restaurant, and for me the food is just so-so. Just one step above what you would be served in a fast food establishment.  The salsa at Don Taco/Taqueria Tacubaya is like a watery tomato puree posing as salsa. For my entrée I choose the Carne Asada Tacos, Refried Beans, and Mexican Rice, both of which had very little taste and the Carne Asada meat was chopped up into very tiny pieces and was tough to chew.  The meal was just very disappointing.  Don Taco/Taqueria Tacubaya isn't the worst but I'm not in a rush to visit again

Pop culture .... Superheroes Unite   I  was overwhelmed once I walked into Comikaze's. I wasn't sure where to start my adventure. Comikaze's is an amazing store full of memorabilia that brought back childhood memories.    Comikaze's has all the vintage collectables, action figures, statues, and comics.  There's, Spider-Man, Hulk, Fantastic Four, Iron Man, Thor, X-Men, G.I. Joes, Star Wars and everything inbetween.  If you want it Comikaze's probably has it.  On top of the excellent selection of merchandise to browse, the customer service you will receive at Comikaze's  is incredible.  Edwin and Mark know their toys.  These guys are encyclopedias of comic knowledge.     As I was waiting at the register Edwin was engaged in a  discussion about everything from action figures, statues, and toys to artists and  publishers. If you have a question Edwin and Mark will have an answer.  If your ever in the area give Comikaze's a try.  You won't be disappointed.

No pressure sales  I wasnt sure what to expect when we went to American Home Furniture to purchase a living room set. I was pleasantly surprised at the large selection and great pricing.  American Home Furniture has all latest styles, with most items in stock and available for immediate pick up or home delivery within 48 hours.  What I appreciate the most about American Home Furniture is their  low pressure sales philosophy, you won't find sales associates following you all over the store.  You can browse the store ans find exactly what ypur looking for. American Home Furniture makes shopping enjoyable and convenient.

A great place for all your pet needs.   I wasnt sure what to expect when I went to Pet Club, the store appeared small from the outside.  However, when I walked in I knew this Pet Store offered everything I would need for my pets.  Pet Club offer a wide variety of Pet Food and Pet Supplies at some of the lowest price possible. I like the bulk dog treats, you select which dog treats go into your bag, and at 6.99 a bag, it's a great deal.  Pet Club offers Bathing Packages that  include, Specialty Shampoo & Conditioner, Ears Cleaned, Nails cut and filed, Teeth brushed, Blow Dry, Brush Out, Bandanna or Bows, and natural pet cologne.  I can't wait to make an appointment for my dogs.  I am so glad I stumbled upon Pet Club, I will be using Pet Club for all my pets needs.

My first visit but not my last.  I've driven by The Haymarker Restaurant dozens of times but have never stopped, that is until tonight.  As you walk into The Haymaker you can't help but admire the decor. The decor is very patriotic and respectful of our American values.  I thought we might be in for a long wait, as the restaurant was packed. However, we were seated within a few minutes.  For being as busy as it was, our waiter, Javier was excellent and attentive.  The Haymaker has an impressive selection of whisky and beers.  The whiskey list is impressive with selections I have never heard of such as Monkey Shoulder. The beer selection was very diverse with several local micro brewers represented.    I couldn't decide what entrée to choose so with a recommendation from Javier, I choose the fish and chips. The fish was absolutely delicious and  flaky.  The fish was light, crunchy, cooked perfectly, and served hot with the best homemade tater sauce and seasoned french fries in town.  My dinner companion had the Grown Up Grilled Cheese, and ribbies and commented that both entrées were awesome.  The entrée portions at Haymaker are large, enough for two.  You will not leave The Haymaker hungry.  Even after finishing our large dinner we decided to have dessert. So we ordered a serving of bread pudding that was also  large enough for two. The bread pudding  was some of the best bread pudding I have ever had.    All during our meal we were checked on and during dessert the owner/manger stopped by and asked us about our dining experience.    Haymaker is definitely on our list of restaurants to visit again. We will definitely be back, during happy hour (4-7 pm) when the craft beers are 1/2 price.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend  Haymaker to anyone for either breakfast, lunch, or dinner. As an added benefit, The Haymaker  Restaurant is not a chain but is locally owned, and that's always an added incentive.

Best BBQ hands down   Today was my first visit to Naked BBQ but it won't be my last.  Naked BBQ has the best BBQ hands down.

In addtion, to thier delicious meat selection Naked BBQ has a variety of side dishes and desserts. Everything from coleslaw, potato salad, macaroni & cheese, baked beans,  roasted vegetables, cornbread,  peach cobbler, and bacon Maple donuts.

I went for the sweet sauce and it was absolutely delicious.   The staff at Naked BBQ is second to none.  Service is fast and friendly.  Food I'd delicious and reasonably priced.  It doesn't get any better.  If you enjoy good BBQ, stop by you won't be disappointed.

When two great comfort foods meet  Welcome Chicken + Donuts  serves exactly what the name says, fried chicken and donuts.  Everything at Welcome Chicken + Donuts is made fresh on the premises daily.   Welcome Chicken + Donuts has the most  amazing flavored donuts.  The dounuts are truly inventive with flavors like espresso, maple bacon, PB&J, crème brûlée, the list goes on and on. These donuts are a must try.  On my first visit I choose one of my favorite flavor combinations, Cream Cheese and Blue Berry.  My lunch companion choose the Apple Fritter and Wisconsin Cheese. The donuts were light, pillowy, and glazed with a wonderfully light sweet topping.  Now let's talk chicken.  All I can say is the chicken at Welcome Chicken + Donuts is delicious.  The chicken has  a crispy well-seasoned skin, and juicy tender meat, just like chicken should be.  Welcome Chicken + Donuts use a unique blend of varuous spices to give a world flavor to their chicken.  You can choose to have chicken seasoned with a dry rub or wet, both are delicious.   Together or separately - the chicken and donuts all winners.  I definitely recommend Welcome Chicken + Donuts.

Trendy, Relaxing, and Really Good Food!   The Culinary Dropout is one of my favorite places and is a Fox Restaurant Concept, generally known for more upscale type establishments.  The atmosphere at Culinary Dropout  is really trendy, relaxing, and cool.    My friends and I were famished, so we opted to order some the pretzels with provolone fondue and it excellent.  I couldnt get enough of the pretzels, and if I hadn't had an entree coming, I probably would have polished off the whole order by myself.  As an entree I ordered the chicken club sandwich which came with a chicken breast, ham and bacon.  It was quite good.  My lunch companion had the fried chciken, and mac & cheese and it equally delicious.  The service was perfect-our server was friendly and there at the right time every time.  We will definitely come back again.

Good Sandwiches  Today, I went to the 'NY Slicers Deli' for lunch.   NY Slicers offers a variety of great sandwiches, soups, and daily specials, at very reasonable prices.  On this visit I ordered the Triple Threat  (Ham, turkey, salami, mayo, oil, vinegar, lettuce and tomato) and my lunch companion had the grilled cheese. The sandwiches at NY Skicers are huge and very filling.  Our sandwiches were delicious, the grilled cheese was cooked just right and the bread on both sandwiches  was very fresh.  The staff at NY Slicers are very friendly, helpful, and accommating.  I  highly recommended, NY Skicers if you like traditional deli sandwiches.

Fun for Kids and Adults   My nephew and I were looking for something to do on a Sunday and we found ourselves at "As You Wish Pottery Painting Place ".  I have to admit my nephew had a lot of fun and so did I.  "As You Wish" is a great place for children and adults to explore their  creativity and have some fun while doing it.  "As You Wish" provides the paints, brushes, pottery, and  assistance by their staff to help you create your very own pottery masterpiece.  The process is a lot of fun, you select a piece of pottery, design &decorate,  come  back in a few days, and your pieces will be glazed, and ready to pick up.  The staff at "As You Wish" are helpful and informative,  it really seems like they enjoy their job.    I would recommed "As You Wish" to anyone who wants to spend quality time together, sit and talk, and explore your creativity.

After running around all day shopping my sister and I decided to grab a bite to eat.  We had heard about Zeta's and decided to stop by.    Zeta's Grill is clean, spacious, and inviting and the staff and service border on amazing.  I have to admit on my first visit to Zeta's I over ate because the food was so good.  My sister and I had the Hummus Shawarma Chicken, Spicy Potatos,  Fried Cauliflower, and the Mixed Grill Kebab.   It was great to try a few different  dishes.  I was unprepared for how good the food was and I will return soon to sample more entrée's.  My first visit was pure enjoyment to find such a great place to dine.

I was born  and raised in New York and as  a Native Yorker I have always enjoyed Italian Ices. So, when I hear about Italian Ices in my area you can bet I will be there.   Hanna's Original Italian Ice is a nice little shop. The staff is friendly  and they offer samples of any flavor you want to try and I tried them all.  On my first visit I tried the lemon, rasberry, and orange, my sister had the cotton candy, and my nephew had the vanilla and chocolate swirl. The Italian ices were lightly sweet, refreshing, with bits of real fruit and the vanilla and chocolate custard was creamy and delicious.  I am glad I found Hanna's and that it's so.close to home.   I will be coming back real soon.

Hit the Spot   As I was driving, heading home from work, I began thinking about what to have for dinner. All I knew is I had a hankering for a sub, so  I decided to check out Jersey Mike's; it turned out to be an excellent decision.  I ordered three Original Italian's and a roast beef and provolone.  As I walked up to the counter I was greeted by the employees who took my order and started preparing my order in no time.  The bread at Jersey Mike's is perfectly, soft, fresh and tasty.  The meats and cheese were definitely fresh and plentiful.  I ordered my sub "Mike's Way" which meant it came with Lettuce, Tomatoes, Onions, Vinegar, Oil and Spices. The sandwiches were delicious, reasonably priced, and great customer service.   If your hungry for a sandwich give a Jersey Mike's A try, you won't be disappointed.

So Good and So close to home.  My family enjoys the bundtini's at Nothing Bundt Cake and we would travel to Phoenix to purchase a dozen or two on special occasions. I was really happy to see that Nothing Bundt Cake opened a new store in the West Valley, less then 2 miles from my house. Now I can get bundtini's when ever I get a craving.  The bundtini's are bite sized Bundt cakes you can purchase by the dozen.  You can even select as many flavors as you wish for you dozen.  There, are so many flavors to choose from.  I really like the white chocolate and the chocolate chip is also delicious.  The staff at Nothing Bundt Cake are friendly and accommodating, they will even offer samples as you wait.   If your ever on the area stop by you won't be dissapoited.

Not Just Your Average Doughnut  As you enter the store you grab a  order sheet, and begin the selection process. You can select from one of  Fractured Prune Doughnuts most popular flavor combos, like OC Sand,  Green with Envy, Death by Chocolate, Carnival, or Apple Pie,  or you can pile-on whatever flavours and toppings you are craving.  As you make your way to the counter you can see piles of hot, freshly made doughnuts, awaiting your requests for how they should be glazed and decorated.    The doughnut artist drops dough into hot grease and fries your cake donuts up fresh and crispy. The piping-hot donuts are then liberally dipped into your topping choices as you watch and then the doughnuts are delivered to you piping hot and fresh.  Our favorites were the Smores, Apple Pie, and  Salted Carmel.  But honestly, there probably isn't a doughnut we didn't like.  The staff is  friendly and helpful. The store is immaculate.  Stop by you won't be disappointed .

Something for Everyone  This place is amazing, one of those restaurants you mentally note to yourself that you want visit again.  Today, I stopped by Panini Salad and Grill with a couple of friends for lunch. This was our first visit to Panini Salad and Grill but it won't be our last.  The staff at Panini Salad and Grill are friendly and helpful with menu questions and recommendations. On this visit I ordered the Chicken Harvest Salad (half size). This salad was fresh, flavorful, and delicious.  I couldn't believe the size of the half salad, it was large, definitely enough to fill you up.   My lunch companions had the Cranberry Walnut Chicken Salad Wrap with fresh Kettle chips.  They both said the wrap was fresh and delicious and the kettle chips were incredible.  On my next visit I know what I'm going to order.  Panini Salad and Grill is a gem. Great food, large portions, incredible aervice, and reasonable prices. What more could you ask for.  If your ever  in the area you should stop by, you won't be disappointed.

A Great Movie Going Expeirence  I decided to take my nephew and two of his friends to go see Captain America - Civil War. I have to admit I usually go to Harkins Theaters but a friend suggested AMC at arrowhead. I am so glad we went to AMC. I was pleasantly surprised to see that AMC offered a great movie going expeirence. So, now it's official, AMC Arrowhead is my new "go to" theatre.   While Harkins Theaters are good, the comfort of Arrowhead  AMC is far superior. The seats at AMC remind me of flying first class. The seats are big, with controlled foot rest, and are motorized to recline all the way back. You can even purchase your tickets on line, choose what seat you want, and avoid being disappointed if the movie is crowded.  The ticket booths and concessions are always well staffed and efficient. The staff are friendly and courteous. So if your looking for a great movie going expeirence, look no further, AMC is the place for you.

The Chipotle of Pizza   I went to Pieology for dinner last night with my sister and nephew and I have to admit we really enjoyed our meals.  Pieology has the same concept which is similar to Chipotle.  You create your very own pizza masterpiece.  Pieology, has an assembly line concept for Pizza or salad if you  prefer.  You walk up to the counter and walk down the line.  As you walk down the line you tell the Pizza cooks what to add to your pizza.  The price remains the same reguardless of what or how many topping  you add to your pizza.  I ordered a pie with tomato sauce, ricotta, mozzarella, roasted peppers, pepperoni and spicy sausage.  My sister and nephew  ordered similar but with a couple of topping changes.   The line moved very quickly so we built or pizza creations, paid, and filled our drinks.  The pizzas came about seven minutes after that.  Pieology offers a good selection of fresh meats, cheeses, and vegetables.  Prices are modest, I had a standard 11 inch pie and a fountain drink for about ten dollars.  The staff is friendly, accomadating,  the food is good, and at a reasonable price.   If your in the area give it a try.

Great prices and excellent customer service.   I always go to Batteries Plus bulbs anytime I need a light fixture or battery. You can't beat the technical expertise and customer service that you receive at Batteries Plus Bulbs.  There is a comfort in knowing that anytime I have question the folks at Batteries Plus Bulbs will have the answer.  The staff at Batteries Plus Bulbs are always friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable .  Even though I didn't end up purchasing anything because my laptop's power supply wasn't the source of the problem, the sales associate took the time to answer all my questions . I highly recommended Batteries Plus Bulb anytime you need a battery.

Disappointed   I was excited to see that Yogis opened a location so close to home.  However, in all honesty I havent had much luck when dining at other Yogis locations but wanted to give this location a try.   Today, I went to Yogis Grill to have a late lunch and meet with a few friends. Some of my lunch companions had sushi, which was just average at best, others had teppanyaki which in all honesty was soggy and lacked flavor. The  other entrée's on the menu we sampled  were, spring rolls, beef & chicken teriyaki   bowls, gyoza, udon, and all these entrée's just weren't very good.  My beef teriyaki was little pieces of beef that was challenging to chew and my potatoe crouquette was crispy on the outside and cold in the middle. Had the crouquette been cooked completely through it wood have been tasty.   I have now been to 3 locations of Yogis Grill and they seem to be about the same quality of food.

The King Of Wings.  I really love wings and ATL Wings is the "King of Wings". This was my first visit to ATL Wings however, it won't be my last.    ATL Wings has a casual vibe. The restaurant is spacious, colorful, clean and the menu is posted above the register. Diners order at the counter, take a seat, and wait for their meal to be delivered.   The menu at ATL Wings is straight-forward.  You can choose either traditional or boneless wings, select how many you want, and choose a flavor. Simple as that. On the recommendation of a co-worker I ordered  Honey Barbecue sauce and the Garlic Parmesan (dry rub).  Both style wings (sauced and dry)were delicious. However, I preferred the ATL style to the sauced wings. These wings are meaty, tender, crunchy, and coated with a flavorful seasoning. I could have ate wings all day. ATL  wings serves their wings  with your choice of Homemade Ranch or Blue Cheese dressing. However, these wings are so flavorful I didn't need any dressing.   I couldn't let this opportunity pass by without trying the homemade biscuits. So, I ordered a two piece honey biscuit to accompany my wings. All I have to say is, these are no ordinary "biscuits". The biscuits at ATL Wings are smothered in honey and powdered sugar and served piping hot. These biscuits are more like sweet flavorful donuts.   I am looking forward my next visit to ATL Wings and more of those biscuits.

A hidden gem  Macaron Cafe is the sweetest find in Arrowhead Mall that I've  discovered in ages. The macarons at  Macaron Cafe are to die for. Macarons Cafe offers a variety of different flavors, and I wanted to sample every single one. However,  I controled myself and I tried the almond, creme brulee, and orange. My favorite was the Wedding Almond, very simple, light, with a creamy filling, the Creme Brulee was equally delicious as was the Orange. This little Shop reminded me of the Macarons I get back home in New York and no wonder why the owners are from New York.  Macaron Cafe offers  breakfast, lunch, Baguette sandwiches, croissants, salads, and even lunch specials. On my next visit I plan on trying the white chocolate, PB&J, and pistachio.  If you enjoy great Macarons head on over to Macaron Cafe.

Hard to find but worth looking for.  I've been waiting patiently  for a brewery to open close to home.  So I  was pleased to finally locate a brewery in my neighborhood and for the Westside of the Valley in general.  I'm glad to say that 8-Bit Aleworks has been worth the never ending search for a brewery. 8-Bit Aleworks is a small operation and and serves about five beers on tap. I'm preferential to wheat beers and 8-Bit's 'White Mage' Wit is fantastic as was the Stout 'Black Mage"  8-Bit is immaculately clean, and the  look and feel of the interior give off a relaxing and comfortable vibe. Fans of nostalgic gaming will enjoy the pixel artwork adorning the walls, of old school video game.   Ryan is one of the owners and he is  accommodating, friendly, and extremely knowledgeable. In fact, all the people I met at 8-Bit  were extremely friendly.  Ryan mentioned that they plan to have arcade games there soon. That would be an absolutely perfect fit. Great beer on tap and old time video games, does it get any better.  I really enjoyed my pint and can't wait to head back to 8-Bit for another.

Hot Sign is On  I am so glad to see that Krispy Kreme opened their doors for business on Tuesday.   The hot glazed donuts from Krispy Kreme are one of those experiences everyone should experience at least once in a lifetime.   Hot, light, and fluffy. I could eat a dozen by myself and for a mere $10 a dozen, what a delicious treat for a reasonable price.     If you have never visited a Krispy Kreme to experience a  hot glazed donuts then you must take advantage of the opportunity if you ever find yourself in the area.

Great Job   If you need to get your vehicle window's tinted and your tired of looking for the right vendor, look no further, Omar's Tinting, is the place for you.   I always want to make sure that I get the absolute most for my money, and that's exactly what I received when I had the tint on my window and sun shade installed at Omar's.  The finished job was absolutely flawless, Omar was extremely helpful in explaining the different options and the cost was perfectly reasonable. Getting my windows tinted through Omar's was one investment I've no regrets on.

Exceeding Expectations.  I felt I needed to update my review on Miracle Mile Delicatessen.  After a recent posting on yelp about my dining experience at Miracle Mile I was contacted by Josh,  Business Manager at Miracle Mile.  Josh and I spoke about my dining experience and at the end of our conversation I felt great. After my convesation with Josh I now know why Miracle Mile has been in the valley for over sixty years. A philosophy of tradition, pride, excellent customer service,and great food is why Miracle Mile stands out.  Customer Service, in my opinion, means exceeding  expectations. All of us  expect a certain level of service, and some expect more than others. However,  when a business EXCEEDS those expectations, it should be acknowledged and that is exactly what Miracle Mile has done, they exceeded my expectations.     In my oponion,  that is what I call the  "WOW" factor.  It's not often that I find myself saying "WOW, I didn't expect that" or "that was beyond what I expected" but thanks to Josh that is exactly what happened.    THANKS, again  Josh for caring about the experience your customers have at your restaurant and a special thanks for the gift card!

Great prices   It's almost unfathomable that a company that barely, if at all, advertises for gasoline can be on the top of my favorite list, for offering the lowest prices on gas in town, but it has.   Sam's Club, knows how to generate customer loyalty with low prices, great customer service, and clean facilities. Sure, at times the lines for fuel can be long, but it's worth the wait. I've used other fueling stations at times, however, I always find myself going back to Sam's Club.

Firehouse Serves up good subs and salads.   First, I have to say the service at Firehouse Subs is great!  The staff welcomes you when you walk through the door.    On this visit to Firehouse Subs.  Upon arriving we were met by an employee handing out menus.  My sister and I were asked if it  was our first visit to Firehouse Subs.  I said "no" however, my sister said "yes". The emoloyee went over the menu and recommended my sister try the smokehouse beef and cheddar brisket.  My sister said the sub was delicious.  I had the meatball sub and the meatballs were very tasty.  I wish there wasn't so much sauce because the bread was very soggy.  After leaving we couldn't stop talking about how good the sub was. So if your hungry for a good sub at a great price, head over to firehouse

A little disappointed   I stopped by WaBa Grill today for lunch. I thought I  would give WaBa Grill a try after reading so many positive reviews.  WaBa Grill is  nice, clean and bright. I was  greeted as I entered the restaurant and the staff was very friendly. I placed my lunch order and sat down, and my entree was prepared quickly.   On this visit I ordered a steak bowl with white rice and an ice tea.  I have to be honest my entree was not very good. The beef was tough, the rice was over cooked, and I did not particularly care for the sauce.  I will probably revisit WaBa Grill in the near future and maybe try a different entree and see how that is.

Not Very Good  The staff at Kingbertos Mexican Food are warm, friendly, and extremely accommodating, which is why I feel terrible for calling out their Mexican food as bland. I really wanted to like Kingbertos  so badly, especially after reading so many positive reviews. However, the food in my opinion just isn't good.  This was my first visit to Kingbertos Mexican Food Restaurant, and for me the food  just isn't good. On this visit  I choose the shredded beef taco, tostada, Refried Beans, and Mexican Rice, both of which had very little taste.  In fact the refried bean almost had a somewhat grey appearance, and the shredded beef was very greasy.  The meal was just very disappointing.  Kingbertos isn't the worst but I'm not in a rush to visit again

Buffalonians would be proud.  For the many people who have moved from the New York area, and settled out west.  Finding that favorite hometown restaurant you left behind has always been a challenge. So for all the "Buffalonians" traveling or who have settled here in Arizona, "Taste of Buffalo" is a must  Taste of Buffalo has the old New York style ambiance and the food to match. The portions are large, really large, these portions are big enough for two, so bring a big appetite. A Taste of Buffalo serves all the authentic deli favorites. Theres the charbroiled Sahlens hot dogs, hot/cold sandwiches, side salads, chicken wings, fries, onion rings, homemade potato chips, and desserts.   On this visit we sampled the Sahlens all beef hot dogs, Beef on a Weck, onion rings, french fries, and homemade potato chips.  The Beef on Weck Sandwich was delicious, piled high with juicy, flavorful, roast beef, au jus, horseradish, on a salted and caraway seeded roll. My nephew and sister devoured the all beef  hotdogs that were grilled to perfection. The onion rings, homemade potato chips,  and french fries were fresh, crispy, and so very tasty.  Taste of Buffalo offers delicious food, great service, reasonable prices, with that "Buffalo" personality. I look forward to football season and catching a Bills game on their tvs while feasting on great food.

This was my first visit to Tortilla Fish, the food wasn't bad, the food was just okay in my opinion. On this visit I ordered a fish and barbocoa taco.  The staff at Tortilla Fish are friendly and acomdating.  I enjoyed being able to watch my tacos being prepared. The fish taco was breaded, deep fried, and then placed onto a fresh warm tortilla, as was the barbocoa. Once my tacos were ready I headed over to the salad cart to add  ingredients of my choice. The salad cart offered lots of options, chopped avocado, tomato, cole slaw, cilantro, salsas, home made tartar sauce, everything and anything you would want on a taco.   All the ingredients on the salad cart  were fresh. I wish that the fish and barbocoa tacos had a better taste. The Fish and barbocoa were fresh, however,  both lacked seasoning and tasted somewhat bland. I didn't care for the tortilla's, which tasted dry and fell apart on the barbocoa taco. The tacos just weren't very good.  Maybe I will revisit in the near future and try something else.

It's a Five  If you have ever driven past the Angry Crab Shack,  I am certain you noticed the packed parking lot and smelled the amazing aroma in the air. So, if you enjoy seafood, like I do, then Angry Crab Shack is calling your name.   Angry Crab Shack gives new meaning to the word casual. The formica topped tables are covered with white butcher paper, people eat with their hands, and writing on the walls is not only allowed, it's encouraged.  Angry Crab Shack is top notch and serves some of the best seafood Arizona has to offer. Sure, one could argue that Coastal towns may have better seafood, but Angry Crab Shack can definitely hold their own.  On my first visit, our server explained everything to us and gave suggestions based on our preferences.  Your entree comes out as it's ready instead of all together. Angry Crab Shack has a team restaurant philosophy, food is delivered by the first person closest to the kitchen when the food is ready.   Initially, there was some confusion among the servers. Our table was delivered a basket of cornbread,  which I thought was complimentary, however,  it was for the table behind us (found that out after eating the basket) and for the record the corn bread was delicious.  I enjoyed ordering off Angry Crab's Menu. You pick your main course, which is sold by the pound. Then you pick your sauce, next you choose how spicy you want your entrée . The boil bag is brought to your table and everything is finger food. That's right, no utensils. You even get a rock to bash your crustaceans.  Thankfully a plastic bib is given and be sure to wear your bib, because you will need it.  The prices are reasonable and food is very good.  You should give this place a try. You won't be disappointed.

Tacos Chiwas knocks it out of the park.  I visited Tacos Chiwas after reading reviews and viewing pictures from a fellow yelper. Tacos Chiwas is a type of no-frills restaurant  that you turn to when you know exactly what you want. So if what you want is piles of meat, cradled inside steaming hot corn tortillas, you need to go to Tacos Chiwas, because the folks at Tacos Chiwas, knock taco making out of the park.  Tacos Chiwas is a family owned business that has a warm and welcoming vibe, which is always a plus. However, the real plus to Tacos Chiwas is the quality of the food, service, and products. So if you were under the impression that tacos had to be complicated, with complex sauces, lots of  garnish, served on fancy plates, think again.  On my first visit to Tacos Chiwas I had the Carne Asada and Al Pastor tacos. The meat in these tacos was tender, flavorful, and practically melted in my mouth. The Carne Asada Taco is stuffed with bubbling, juicy bits of lightly marinated skirt steak, nestled in a warm homemade tortilla, delicious doesn't begin to describe the Carne Asada Taco. However, I couldn't possibly overlook the Al Pastor with its sweet meat, topped with onions and cilantro, so flavorful, moist, and delicious, I could have ate a dozen.   I am looking forward to my next visit to Tacos Chiwas, I can't want to try everything. I can't say enough about Tacos Chiwas, if you want delicious tacos, burittos, gorditas, frijoles, rice  with great service and local flavors go to Tacos Chiwas.

What Happens When New York ... Meets Arizona?? You Get Chompies!  Arrowhead is open!  Chompies  has the old New York style ambiance and the food to match. The portions are large, really large, these portions are big enough for two. So bring a big appetite.  Chompies serves all the authentic deli sandwiches, soups, salads, bagels, breads and desserts.  I've  been to Chompie's several times and have never been disappointed and now there is a Chompies close by. The Arrowhead location is open for business. The service at this location  is just like the others, attentive, and spot on.    The sandwiches at Chompies are incredible. The  Pastrami and Corned Beef are perfectly lean, piled high,and oh so tender. If you make it to Chompies you have to try the Original  Jewish sliders.  These sliders are incredible. Moist lean brisket, piled high on challah roll, a mini potato pancake on the bottom,  with jack cheese, served with a side of hot brown dipping  gravy. This slider couldn't be any better.   The soups are wonderful, especially the matzo ball. The pastry counter is endless, you have to try the black and white cookie  Chompie's is a must for breakfast or lunch if your in the area!

InCREPEable  This morning I woke up with a craving for crepes, which aren't so easy to find in the West Valley.  On the recommendation of fellow "yelpers" I headed to P.A.K Crepes and Coffee to satisfy my craving and I'm so glad I did.    P.A.K Crepes and Coffee are made from scratch and are absolutely delicious. This small little eatery located in the West Valley is serving breakfast and lunch, with a selection of wallet-friendly sweet and savory crepes, for a mere $5.25.  P.A.K offers a variety of crepes to indulge your every craving. Theres Chicken,Turkey, Ham, Spinach, Cheese, Yogurt, and Fruit options. On this visit I had the Peach, Carmel, Pecan, and Cream crepe. I can honestly say that this is one of the best crepe I ever had. I can't wait to visit again and try the Nutella and chocolate sauce balanced with cream cheese and strawberries and bananas.  In addition to delicious crepes P A.K offers Hot & Iced coffee, Frappuccino, and smoothies. The Iced  White Chocolate Coffee was the perfect pairing for my crepe.  If you find yourself craving delicuous crepes and coffee head over to P.A.K Crepes and Coffee,  you won't be disappointed. The staff are friendly and inviting and the place has a nice casual vibe.
