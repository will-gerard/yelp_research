This is by far my favorite place on the strip. The energy at the Bellagio is radiant and I always feel happy and relaxed whenever I'm spending time here. The casino is huge and there are a nice variety of games. It's also very clean and well kept.    My favorite thing is the interior design with this hotel. There's a indoor botanical garden that is absolutely magnificent and they change it every season. There's also floral blown glass on the lobby ceiling. It's breathtaking. Outside they have a huge water design with fountains and lights. Every night they do a water show where there's music, fountains shooting up and lights to go along with the show. LOVE this place. It's gorgeous. :)

I stayed at this hotel for 3 days and enjoyed it very much. The hotel itself, and the rooms were clean and modern. The lobby and casino are nice and well kept as well. There's a small food court area and a bar/restaurant, but not too much going on. I would recommend staying here, it was very nice, especially for the price. The only not so great thing in my opinion is the location. It's towards the end of the strip, so it's not in the middle of the excitement and entertainment.

I hate to leave a negative review seeing as how my family and I have been Criss Angel fans since we first discovered him in 2006. We own all if his DVDs and watch them often. It's safe to say we are huge fans and absolute believers. And we still are.      The show started off on great note with a catchy and funny opening. There were sexual and puny jokes throughout the show,that I found clever and sassy. This was the only good thing about the show to me.      After watching Criss passionately perform on Mindfreak I felt very sad and disappointed with his tricks and illusions. They were very basic and unimpressive. My family and I traveled hundreds of miles and spent over $600 on good seats just to be let down. Criss spent 15 min showing a slide show of pictures and clips of his past, which was nice, but not practical for a magic show  and which we had already seen on his DVDs. The crew looked great and Criss is a great guy, but I would not recommend this show if you are a Criss Angel fan, because it will not live up to your expectations.

This was my first time eating here and it was very good. The location is hard to find but if you know what your looking for pretty much anyone can tell you where to go.     The atmosphere is cool, much like everything in Vegas. The food was strange but very tasty. Everything seemed kind of mushed up on one plate, but eaten all together it had a really good flavor. The portions are very big so it's easy to share. Overall I would recommend  eating here for breakfast and some solid food.

I'm really not a fan of this salon. It's overpriced and the services are average. Almost every time I get my nails here they end up lifting up within two days. Every time I come back in to get it fixed they charge me for each nail. I don't know if the glue is cheap or they don't use enough. Either way I pay $40 for a set on nails that don't last, which is ridiculous.   I also notice that the nail techs are very rough and move way too fast when doing my nails. One of my nails started actually bleeding because of how rough my nail tech was. I only continue to go here because it is the only nail salon in my area, but I would not recommend it.

I really don't think that this boutique is as bad as everyone is making it out to be. Although it is a little overpriced, there are some things that I found that I would consider a great deal. The jewelry and accessories are beautiful and well priced and most of the clothes are great because you won't see other people around Phoenix wearing the same exact thing. A lot of the items are blingy and bedazzled, but there are still plenty of other options around the boutique. And as far as a greeting or farwell, I don't expect the staff at a small expensive boutique to be well experienced in cutsomer service. Overall it's really a cute store, but maybe could use a little price adjusting.

This place was very lame. Crowd was dry  and the staff were aggressive for no reason. Just trying to have fun and chill, wouldn't recommend to a anyone. I was with 4 others. And they agree. Wasn't welcoming at all.

I love love love Iron Chef! The place itself is small but spacious and decorated very nicely. The staff are all very polite and attentive. The quality of the food is amazing and the happy hour prices are unbelieveably cheap. It's a great atmosphere and I consider this my favorite sushi joint in town :)

Love this place. The lunch pizza & salad combo was delish. Caesar salad and Chicken Pesto pizza were good portions and price. The happy hour sangria is yummy too :) great service, atmosphere  and food!

The food was really amazing. I got the Veggie Head omelette that came with hash browns and pancakes... Which is a lot of food for a decent price. Great place for a lunch date and yummy food.

I got a full body massage here a few times and I recommend it to friends who love it. For a $30 per hour massage it's an amazing deal. The massage is in a chair in one large room with others also getting massages, but with dividers between chairs. I enjoy each massage because they do well and they soak your feet and really work out knots and tension.  If you can get over experiencing the massage with others in the room, it is absolutely worth it.

I found her on Groupon and I was pleasantly surprised considering the low price. She's kind, doesn't make the wax awkward whatsoever and does a great job with the actual wax. I would absolutely recommend her. :)

Found them on Groupon and am glad I did. Prices are reasonable and the waxes are quick and very well done. Beautician was very nice and easy going. They also were able to fit me in for an appointment a few hours before scheduling :)

Love it. Mostly for the atmosphere and social aspect but the food and drinks were also great. Would definitely recommend for a date or hang out spot with some good brews.
