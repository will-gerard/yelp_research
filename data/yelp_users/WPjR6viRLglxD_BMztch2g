2.5/5 potential  i think they have good ideas. or maybe i ordered the wrong thing. i got this chicken parmesan type dish, only made mexican style. it came with a well cooked spaghetti in a bright cilantro pesto, the the chicken was sauced with chipotle rather than marinara. then it came with a small side salad and avocado. pretty decent, no?  problem is the chicken wasn't well cooked, it was kinda burnt and dry, the pasta was a little too salty, etc. i also tried a taco and it was greasy and the shell was kinda stale.   anyways, i think the ideas here are good, just need better execution.

2/5 standard chinese.  i'll start off by saying it was my fault for getting chinese in phoenix. but a senior in my office was heading there, so of course i had to go. the food is standard chinese/cornstarch fare, though i'm sure there is a saving chef's specialty dish.

4/5 dangerous sweets.   oh my. sugar. bars. yum. i'm glad i can only get this when i'm in town for business, otherwise i'd have to get pants in new sizes.

3.5/5 great salads.  the salads here are kinda amaze. the chop has everything in it, but isn't just a kitchen-sink kinda dish - it still works. the cookies are also nom, in case  you are inclined to order one to break over your salad...not that i do that. the only down side is the wait time sometimes, which may be because they remake your order, or they can't find you. maybe they'll rethink some of the last prep station staffing, because it seems there's always a group of staff there, but the food isn't coming out any faster.

4/5 favorite part of the airport  i fondly remember finding the downtown location on a long walk from the office i used to work from when i was in consulting - it was like oh whoa! and then suddenly there it was in my terminal.  it's an efficient operation, and i'm thankful that in between the stress of traveling i can get great caffeinated beverage. on a recent visit, i also opted for a bag of beans as i knew i was running low, and if you grab a bag they cover your coffee for free! the sandwiches are tasty, but definitely also airport priced.
