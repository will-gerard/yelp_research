This little neighborhood laundry facility is super clean and tidy, and the lady running it is super sweet. They even have dry cleaning here or drop off laundry service!

Very mediocre Chinese food. I followed a few tips from previous yelp reviewers, but they must know what good Chinese food is. The fried rice was just rice with soy sauce, no veggies or egg or anything. The low mein was just that... Noodles. Bland. Boring. Sticky noodles. And the sesame beef was mainly fat and grissle and covered in a super sweet honey sauce. The only saving grace was the crab puffs, they were pretty tasty and different than what I've had before.

I love this place! And the staff is extremely friendly. The sandwiches are huge and delicious! But the amazing part of this place is the giant case of Italian butter cookies when you walk in. Cookie Heaven!!!!!!

During my search for amazing Chinese delivery in my new neighborhood, I came across Abacus. I was hopeful that it wouldn't be like the two other place I had already tried. Thank goodness it wasn't!  We had the Orange Beef, House Special Chicken, Chicken Chow Mien, and Crab Puffs. All of it was delish. They have some really full and tasty crab puffs!! My fav so far that I've ever had!!  One thing I would like to point out is when the deliver, they put the sauce in the side in a cup. Amazing!! It keeps the crispness of the deep fried goodness crunchy and not soggy. You can then use as much or as little sauce as desired! Genius!!!!  Their rice however just wasn't the sticky goodness rice that I prefer. It was more like jasmine long kernel rice. This knocked the score down just one star. I will for sure order again!

Usually I go to a hair stylist for my cuts, but a friend and I were on our way to an event and needed to freshen up. So we walked in and were immediately in the chair. The owner Mark did an amazing job. Not only did he actually have a sense of humor, he is completely gay friendly. He even recommended where to put the lines on my beard trim to compliment my face. I highly recommend this place.

When I saw they have a 28" New York Style pizza, my friends and I had to try it. When I opened the door to the glorious sight of seeing a delivery guy holding this ginormous box of cheese & pepperoni goodness, I laughed. It wouldn't even fit through my front door without being tilted. Haha!  Once we set it on the stove top and realized the box was even bigger than my stove top, we could not stop laughing! But then we opened the box.... A moment of silence came over us... Then our mouths dropped and we starred at this magnificent sight of holy amazingness... Still maintaining the silence... Drool was starting to run off our lips...  Then like a pack of ferocious wild animals, we dived in and grabbed the largest slice of heaven we get our hands on. This pizza is definitely a two hander. And all for under $30???????  Pizza Divino has me sold!!!! True NY style pizza!! It was delish!!!
