I shouldn't have to ask for bread with oil and vinegar.  I shouldn't have to ask for refills.  I shouldn't have to sit in a boiling hot dining room when other rooms (being much, much cooler) are open and available.  The fat man at the next table smelled like their greasy trash compactor.  I've never been impressed with the service here.  The food is only ok.  They stress the large portion sizes because it appears there is nothing special about the quality of the food.  And the nudity on the walls makes this place entirely inappropriate for children or immature adults.

OMG the prices!  First off, I'm a chimichanga freak. I always get the chimi (if available) at new mexican food places. We chimichanga lovers need to stick together, since there aren't many of us out there. I can tell you, as far as chimis go, you can find better elsewhere, and for cheaper, too. $9.25 for a chimi plate. Ouch!  Having grown up in Gilbert, it's amazing I haven't tried this place until now. At least I can say that I have. And that's about all I can say about it. As a first timer, I was a little lost and confused. Is it a sit down place? Do they bring me my food? When I asked for a water cup I got just that. A cup. I looked everywhere for a soda/water fountain (couldn't find one). Would have been nice to know that the water bucket/container/thingy was on the counter in front of me. Water tasted like the plastic container it was stored in. Yummy.  Another hefty deduction comes from having to pay $4 for chips and watery salsa. I couldn't believe the amount of "nickel and dime"ing going on at this place. It was unreal. Especially for the decor and quality of the place. I wasn't expecting much, and I certainly didn't get much in return, except a $17 tab for two. I thought this would have been eating on the cheap. I should have gone to Oregano's up the street, instead.  Won't be back, unless they start giving free chips and salsa, and knock a $1 off the chimichanga plate. For what it's worth, my wife enjoyed her mixed burrito.

Great location for outdoor shooting!  Of course, there aren't many to choose from anyway, but that's beside the point.  I've been going here for years, and I've always been pleasantly surprised by the staff and the atmosphere.  Prices are more than fair, and the facility is perfect for everything I've ever shot.  My only suggestion is making it a tad more professional, or maybe even strict, on the acceptance of gang-banger, AK-47 totin', 21 year old Rambo's.  I was sprayed with hot lead this week by such a hero, right in front of three employees, and none of them said a word to the tattooed rednecks.  They were sprayin' lead all over the range, tearing up the target of the guy next to me.  Now I know instances like this are pretty rare, but in the future, it'd be nice if someone else would stand up to retards like this.  With that being said, I do love this shooting range, and I'm likely to return here quite often.  Highly recommended.

Overall a pleasant experience. Knowledgeable, friendly, and personable waiter. Everything came out on time, hot, and tasting excellent. All the employees were nice, and the big boss man even stopped by to see how everything was. Nice touch.  Love the bamboo water spout in the bathroom. A+.  My only beef is with the sauces. We ordered the Calimari, which is outstanding by itself, but I felt the sauce they provided was lacking something. Took me half the meal to finally figure out which dipping sauce went well with the little squiddies. Turns out it just needed some lemon juice.

Somewhat of a regular.  I always get the bean and cheese chimichanga.  Never had an issue.  Food always comes out fast and piping hot.  Probably the best chimi for the price, anywhere.  I'll always come back to you, Fiesta Burrito.  Viva la salsa roja!

Customer service is top notch as far as Taco Bell goes.  The manager here is awesome, and is always upbeat, energetic, and friendly.  I haven't been disappointed at this location, which is why I keep going back.  It's small and old, but they've kept it up well.  The only bad thing is the lack of parking...but they can't really help that, I guess.  Hats off to the Manager of this location.  Quiktrip could use someone like you.

I come here quite frequently. The place is small, as you probably know, but overall the employees are friendly and helpful, and I've never had an error with my food. Impressive by any fast food standards considering how often I've come here.  A shout out to Wayne the drive thru guy. Always friendly, precise, and on the ball. The guy deserves a raise, or a promotion.

Hats off to the family who owns this place.  Great authentic food at good prices in a fun atmosphere makes for a winning combination.  Just don't let it get to your head.  Oh, and be sure to call in and order instead of just swinging by during your lunch break.  Shaves off about 15-20 minutes of waiting.

There are controlled burns, and there are wildfires. Los Dos is the latter. My wife accurately described this place as being both the best and worst experiences she's had at a restaurant. The food was delicious, but the burn was ridiculous!  My boss has taken many pregnant women here (who are on the cusp of delivery), and after eating the spicy food here, nearly every single one went into labor (not immediately, of course, but within a day or two). Pretty wild.  My only complaint is with the service being a little lousy/forgetful. But on the other side of things, the owner did come by and help and chat for a while.  Be aware, you can still eat here if you can't handle spicy food. Just avoid the salsas at the beginning and you'll likely be okay. Order an horchata just to be sure. But one thing is certain, you've got to try a plate with adovada ( marinated pork), especially when a fried egg is included. One of the best mexican-style plates I've ever had.

Mr Johnson must not have taste buds if he claims the food is flavorless.  I mean, come on, it's got jerk seasoning for Pete's sake!  I love this restaurant, and although it can be a bit pricey, the food is unique and very tasty.  The only downside is that I have to drive 20 miles to get there, otherwise I'd probably go much more often.  Oh, and the best part?  The cookies, included with each entree.  Nice.

Been here numerous times, and usually I'd rate them a 4 out of 5.  Lately, however, it appears that management is never on duty.  They are slow and inattentive.    I had called ahead with a large party of around 20 people nearly a week in advance, and again a few hours before our alotted time.  Upon arrival, our tables were neatly set aside and marked as reserved.  However, a few cooks didn't show up for work, or management just didn't see the point in having more than two on a Saturday night.  It took an hour for us to get our food.  AN HOUR!  The place was slammed, which is good for them, but we watched as more customers ended up leaving instead of staying and waiting over an hour for their food.  The wait was ridiculous, especially since we arrived at our scheduled time with the number of people we said we would have.    I've never been to the original Chino Bandido, but apparently this one isn't able to accomodate groups of any size in a reasonable time period.  This was the second time we brought our group to Chino, and I guarantee it was the last.

I must be the only Gilbertan who doesn't have a love affair with Gecko Grill. I just caught wind via Facebook that this place is closing (although probably temporarily, while they seek a new location). It really wouldn't surprise me if the place closed for good, judging solely by the quality of food and service. But I suppose it has a large enough fanbase of Gilbertans to keep it floating.  Anyway, my numerous experiences here have all had a similar flavor. Just ho-hum. A measely 5/10 on the food, and 4/10 for service. The place is small, and there's usually a wait for that mediocre food and sub-par service. I always go with an open mind, and always leave disappointed, until I just stopped going altogether.

Very friendly and knowledgeable staff.  This Home Depot seems to have a bigger selection of items than others.  There were a few times when the employees sent me back and forth to different areas in search of a more hard to find item, but other than that, everything has gone well on each of my visits. I just finished hanging my hammock in my backyard, and it went smoother than expected thanks to the staff.  Will definitely return, especially since I just bought a house and have lots of future projects.

Just moved out to QC a month ago, and I've been trying to set up cox internet for the past three weeks now.  They've come out twice to install it, with no success.  I was just woken up at 7 am today (Sunday morning) with a phone call from them.  I said, "You know it's 7 in the morning, right?"  And the lady, Lisa, responded, "Yeah, well I have to call you at least an hour before your appointment."  "Nobody told me I had an appointment at the crack of dawn!"  Pretty pathetic that they can't even let their customers know what's going on.  I don't even have their service yet, and I'm already feeling like they can't keep their ducks in a row.  I'm going to agree with other reviewers and say that their phone people are not the smartest, nor the nicest people around.  Maybe if their service didn't suck, customers wouldn't be grumpy with them, and their phone people wouldn't be asses back.

My wife is asian. Therefore I know a good boba when I taste one.  These are very good boba drinks. Chic atmosphere, quick service, competitive prices. Highly recommended.  Will absolutely most definitely make this a routine stop from now on. Just wish I would have discovered it sooner.

Went there for the first time with my wife over the weekend.  Service was a little slow at first, and the place seemed a little dead.  There were people there eating, but the atmosphere was dull.  Once the food started arriving, however, we became happy very quickly.  The wonton soup was the best I've EVER had, which is saying a lot (my wife is Chinese).  The food overall was probably a 8.5 out of 10.  The portions were decently sized, and the menu was mostly straightforward.  There are some discprepancies with what type of fried rice comes with their two meal special, which was disappointing, and I love finding the double adjectives in the menu, like "tasty delicious orange chicken."  I might be back, if only for the wonton soup.  The other appetizers are a little overpriced for what you get.  Fix that and this could be a 5 star establishment.

Felt like I ate mud.  Extremely heavy, bland, not spicy, soggy...not enough bean dip/salsa for the bowl of chips.  I echo other statements; Filiberto's is better, and cheaper, and faster.  Don't waste your time or money (or general body comfort).  I have no idea how Serranos is still in business.

I don't understand what prompts people to come to this place.  They don't take credit cards?  Don't try to tell me that's part of the "charm."  It's time to expand your customer base!  However, that won't do you any good if you're always serving up cold, tasteless fries.  The fish patties are decent, but the "chips" need some serious help.  "Chips" is in your name, for Pete's sake!

Food was slightly above average, when compared to similar sushi joints.  Small place, and if you don't show up at the right time, it gets packed quick.  Food came out quickly, but it was a nightmare trying to get our check.  The best part was the complimentary ice cream after dinner.  The Mango and Red Bean flavors were excellent.

I'm a frequent visitor of Sakana.  My wife and I love it.  Prices are better than average (during happy hour).  Portions, while being only 5 pieces for happy hour, are stuffed full.  While nearly every visit leaves us satisfied, the last couple of times haven't been nearly as good.  It might be the new wait staff, or that we just got a not-so-fresh batch of fish on our plate.  If my last visit had been my first time at Sakana, I probably wouldn't have returned.  However, since the majority of the time the food is a B+, and because the prices are good, I'll continue to come back.  The joint is small, and the hours are somewhat goofy (close around 2pm after lunch and re-open up at 5:30 for dinner), so come early on and plan accordingly.

Horrible, horrible, horrible experience.  Service was atrocious, and no offers to compliment or even correct the wrong cheesecake order.  It was just pathetic.  I've never walked out without paying a tab, but this was the closest I've ever come.  I wanted to kick and scream, that's how angry I was.  Add that experience to all the reviews of their food being LOADED with calories, and I can tell you I won't go to another Cheesecake Factory again.  Seriously, check out articles on Yahoo about the worst restaurant foods, and Cheesecake Factory is always on the list.

Been here twice now, and I've been somewhat impressed.  The only thing that bothered me was the lack of the little flat bread and veggie/pico thingy during lunch time.  Apparently it's only for the special dinner diners.  Lame.  My wife and I have had two different sandwiches and two different pizzas.  I had the Cuban once, which was good, and then a sliced beef with cheese peppers and other goodness sandwich, and it was awesome!  My only other complaint is with the sides for the sandwich.  Some nice fries or potatoes would be better than a little baggy of chips.  Just me, I suppose.

Cool atmosphere, friendly service...unique bathrooms (with unisex sinks).  But that's about it.  Serving sizes were pathetic. (I spend $30 for THAT?) Other sushi joints give you double the portions for the same price, if not half the price you'd pay at Roku. Quality was right on par with most other sushi bars. I did feel like I was being hounded to 1) buy a drink, 2) buy edamame, or 3) order more sushi (which many people probably do, considering the portion sizes).  I'm unlikely to return to this venue, unless I begin to miss the decor and snotty valet people.

Simply some of the best Italian I've had in Arizona.  We were fortunate to have some Babbo's catered to our work on Saturday, and I can tell you, it was the highlight of my day.  We had a penne pasta dish with meatballs and italian sausage, a salad, and breadsticks.  The meatballs were deliciously moist and filled with spices and herbs.  Phenomenal.  I really enjoyed the salad, and the bread wasn't laden with butter like so many other garlic bread/breadsticks at most establishments.  My only question...when will the East Valley be treated to such magnificent Italian cuisine?

One of the better sushi joints I've frequented (and I've been to quite a few). I didn't have much time to look over the menu, but I noticed that the Happy Hour menu is seriously lacking some variety with Nigiri and Rolls. Never saw the traditional miso soup and salad, but maybe you have to order a meal or something. No big deal, but it's nice to have it.  Overall I was pleased with the quality and size of the sushi. Not typically a fan of the simple California Roll, but theirs was very pleasant. Big serving of Salmon Nigiri was great, especially after going to Roku and being served itty-bitty bite sized fish.  The cool thing about Sushi Creek is the expansive menu, and the "I hate sushi" menu. It means you can come here with a group and everyone will leave happy. I'll definitely be back, especially after seeing the deep fried pickles on the appetizer menu.

Best miso soup and salad dressing I've found in the valley thus far. Menu could use a little more variety, but overall the food is good, fresh, and service is quick.  One of my favorite Sushi places in the East Valley.

I have also known Rienda's since it was called Riva's.  I remember going there my first time with my 4th grade teacher some 15 years ago.  The bean and cheese chimichanga's will beat the enchilada style burritos any day.    Not a whole lot of seating, and the place can be a little dingy at times, but the food is great for the price.  It's a secret indulgence of mine.

Never gotten an order right.  Employees are apathetic, even by fast food standards.  Go somewhere else.  And I must have a way with the drive-thru ladies, because I always seem to get hit on at Taco Bells across the valley.  Must be my sexy, spanish accent....

Five star establishment. Been here multiple times for tire repair, and never felt the pressure of an upsell.  The other day I showed up before opening, and the line outside was long. Thankfully, I had scheduled an appointment online the night before, and they got me going right away.  Never had any complaints.

Employees here are usually somewhat friendly, although one employee parked his trashy car in front of the door, bumpin' his "tunes," and walked in draggin' his pants on the floor to chit-chat and distract the rest of the staff. Food typically comes out fast, and usually hot.  Can't really expect much more than that from McDonald's.  My following complaints are directed more towards McDonald's as a whole.  It's frustrating to walk up and look at a menu that is constantly changing.  Prices aren't visible, items are never in the same spot, the menu is crowded, etc.  Take a lesson from Chick-Fil-A or In and Out Burger.  Keep it simple, stupid.  But the thing that frustrates me most is the sign that reads "There will be an additional charge for extra condiments."  Excuse me?!  I don't freaking remember getting a discount because you FORGET my condiments 50% of the time!  That sign just makes me irate, and I can't wait for someone to try and charge me extra for ranch or sweet and sour dipping sauce.  Go ahead, try it.  I dare you!  I think McDonald's is foolish for putting up those signs.  Few (if any) other restaurants do anything similar, and as everyone can attest, fast food chains ALWAYS forget ketchup, ranch, BBQ sauce, napkins, straws, etc.... It's unfair and unconstitutional to demand payment for condiments we should have received in the first place!

As I'm sure you know by now, Panchero's makes fresh tortillas whe you order and mixes the ingredients before wrapping the burrito.  Can we move on now? Please?!?  There are other places out there offering similar food, but I feel Panchero's does it better.  One big bonus over "the big burrito maker that shall not be named" is the ever important punch card.  I like to be rewarded for eating good food.  It's not the best food on the planet, but it's better than many others out there, and the salsas and fresh tortillas are my favorite parts of the burritos there.  Chipotle is over-hyped, in my opinion.  I like this place because the line is never "Great Wall of China" long.

Went for breakfast one morning inside.  I was first in line, ordered a simple combo breakfast meal....and boy, I'm glad I brought a book.  It took them 20 minutes, and they still didn't have my food out.  I demanded a refund, and the manager didn't even say sorry or offer an incentive to wait while she brought out my food.  The girl behind me had immediately ordered an iced coffee and hash browns....and still, after 20 minutes, she didn't even have her order.  I'm usually mildly impressed with Wendy's service (could be better, but better than most), but this time they absolutely flopped.  It also took corporate over a week to contact me after I'd submitted multiple complaints, and even after they contacted me, I felt equally disappointed.

There is no better convenience store or gas station out there.  QT rocks, and this is probably one of the cleanest and most friendly out there.  And the manager there?  That guy is FAST!  And not just going through the motions, either.  He's fast AND friendly; very genuine.  Props to him and the way he runs his store.  Lucky for me I live about 1/2 mile away, so I'll be doing all my business at this QT.  Repeat customer for life.

Eric is top notch.  Yeah, the place is small, and there's not a big flashy sign, but Eric knows his cars.  He's fair and honest, always offering advice to the benefit of his customer.  Overhead is low, so prices are more than competitive.  If you own a VW, Audi, or any other driving machine, Eric is the man you want to trust with your precious ride.  Whether it's standard maintenance or some high performance tuning, Tuning Gruppe is above the rest.

Never been impressed with this location.  It must be difficult to make food items from both Long John Silvers (gag me) and Taco Bell at the same time, because I've almost always had an issue with my order.  In fact, by smell alone, it's nigh impossible to differentiate between the sea food and mexican cuisine.   The only good thing about this Taco Bell is that it's new-ish, and the newness makes me assume that it's clean.  Unless you're really craving some greasy fish-smelling double deckers, I suggest going elsewhere.  In fact, there's a McDonald's up the street, and I've never gotten a cold batch of fries from them.

Used to be a regular.  Always got the same bean and cheese chimichanga, and it's never given reason to complain.  Strolled in tonight, ordered a bean and cheese chimi (not the combo) and a large Horchata, and the girl wanted to charge me $11.50.  That's highway robbery!  I asked why it was so much, and she said that it's extra to put cheese inside the chimi.  Excuse me?  I've NEVER been charged extra for BEANS AND CHEESE, not at Filiberto's, not at Fiesta Burrito, Rienda's....never.  It's always been extra for the steak, shredded beef, chicken, or whatever, but not beans and cheese.  I voiced my disagreement, but the girl was in no mood to budge.  That's the last time I go there.  And what a shame, since it is conveniently two minutes away from my house.  Now I have to drive to Ironwood.  Oh, and this place will probably go under soon, just like everything else in that plaza.  I feel like the floors are always greasy, and the parking lot is definitely a place where some type of assault might happen.

Waiting 16 minutes for fast food is a little excessive. No apology from the "tray bringer outer" person. A simple "thanks for being patient" or "sorry about the wait" goes a long way. You know it's bad when number 28 is done eating and gone by the time 30 (me) is called.  The dude also can't seem to get an order right, cause he forgot my chicken soft taco and messed up a couple orders after mine. Plus, what's up with the remake of the Big Fat Crispy Chicken Taco? It's half the size of the original, and I'm pretty sure it costs more. Lame if you ask me.

Nothing compares to Chick-Fil-A.  McDonalds is trying to copy quality (and is failing) with their new premium chicken sandwiches, but they left me craving Chick-Fil-A with every bite.  The food is great, the menu simple and straightforward (I hate confusing and misleading menus).  As others have mentioned, customer service goes above and beyond.  These folks really seem to enjoy their jobs.  McDonalds employees don't.  I'm glad we have a Chick-Fil-A out here in the boonies.  In fact, this has me craving one of their amazing milk shakes....where are my car keys?

Out in the boonies (Queen Creek), our choices are limited when it comes to good food in general.  To find good Chinese, it's often a 20 mile trip into Chandler.  But my wife (who is Chinese) and I discovered Moon China over the weekend.  For months we've gotten coupons and ads about Moon China, but we were always afraid to try it.  After all, how good can Chinese food be in the middle of, essentially, nowhere?  The place is low key, that's for sure.  Blink and you'll drive right by it.  The decor is simple, though my wife and I couldn't stop staring at the pebble-infused tables.    I wish someone would have told us how large the portions were.  We each got an entree, plus she ordered a bowl of soup, and I had to have the cheese wontons.  Holy cow they were good!  The entrees were extremely large, and we had no idea that they came with a cup of soup.  After stuffing our faces with Kung Pao Chicken and Sweet and Sour Pork, we had tons of leftovers.  We ate the leftovers the next day, and still had leftovers remaining!  If you don't mind a small building and employees who speak "Chin-glish," then this place is awesome.  Get Sweet and Sour ANYTHING and you'll love it.  Don't forget the cheese wontons.  Just go light on the wasabi-infused mustard sauce.

Came here months ago when it was under different management.  Horrible experience.  I vowed never to go back.  Then I caught wind that those jerks had been replaced, so I figured I'd give it a try again.  The experiences were night and day.  New management was awesome.  Nice, warm, welcoming, and informative.  This makes for a great date night activity.  Just wish they could modify the place for some larger caliber weapons.  Oh, and be sure to try your hand at the target competition they have going.  I believe the cash prize was over $300, last I checked.

Just found out about this place today.  Swung by and picked up the Italian Beef, loaded with cheese and hot peppers.  Being an AZ native, I wasn't quite sure what to expect with the sandwich, but I can say that I was pleasantly surprised.  The beef was very thin, tender, and tasty, and the sauce/oil/gravy was good (and plentiful).  You definitely need multiple napkins for this one.  Four stars because I still want to try other items on the menu.  The Chicago style dog looked good.  My only complaint is the decor of the place.  With my wife being an interior designer, I'm a little picky; the decor was extremely misleading for the type of food they serve.

Not sure why Yelp filtered my review of this place.  I've been here 4 times now in the last month, and each time the food was great.  My favorite is a three way tie for the burger (cheap and huge!), cheese steak, and italian beef.  As a matter of fact, I'm debating which one I'm going to get today.  Awesome place.  Not too pretty, and a little unorganized (they're just getting started) but it has excellent food and a promising outlook.  Now Yelp, leave my review up, please. Your filtering policy/program is garbage.

$3 car wash signs are misleading. That $3 gets you a rinse, no soap, and no air dry. What's the point?  To get a decent wash expect to pay at least $5-6. Don't worry about all of the extra stuff (you'd be dumb to pay $10 for a wash here). It doesn't do much good.  The vacuums sucked. Which is good. But alas, only 2 stars for misleading advertising.
