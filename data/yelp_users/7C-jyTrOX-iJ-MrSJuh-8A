Love coming here with other students, teachers, or just on a date night! When I met my fiancee I was more excited to come and see his mentor, John Ebinger the bassist. I was lucky enough to watch Michael Christie before he left his tenure with the Phoenix Symphony Orchestra. We were very lucky to have him for eight years. I cannot recommend highly enough the Pops series for a bit of fun with the family or friends. The orchestra plays almost 200 concerts every year, so there is always a ton of concerts to choose from. They offer a regular series of Classics, Symphony Pops, Chamber Orchestra, and Family offerings. They also celebrate the holidays with special events and community celebrations.   I get tickets for free from my honors program, but they offer a college club program where you can attend unlimited Classic concerts for only $30! They also offer a special price of $11.50 one hour prior to performance (excludes special event/family concerts) for students with ID, and 25% off for seniors. Teachers get 50% off any ticket! Yay!  Dress: This is America so you can pretty much do what you want in terms of dress, however, I prefer to dress formally when I go to the symphony, it makes the experience for me. You can dress business casual and feel quite comfortable, though I usually notice that people dress up when they come (conservatively, not Jennifer Lopez navel baring, Versace dress wearing).   When to clap: look at the conductor's arms, are they down? Good, more than likely the piece is over and you may clap your little heart out. It's always amusing to see people go crazy in the middle of a piece. Woooo! You conduct you little conductee!  Come ahead of time to attend the pre-concert chats before every Symphony Classics, and Coffee Classics concerts, where members of the audience get to interview guest artists, and members of the orchestra! Allow time for parking, the main entrance and will-call window is located on the West side of the building.   They have a full bar, including coffee and tea if you choose to imbibe before, during, or after the concert. There are so many restaurants to choose from in the CityScape area.

Every time I come here I am somewhat reminded of the South Park episode where the class takes a field trip to the planetarium, but Cartman sneaks off to try out for a Cheesy Poofs commercial. Yes, they have a planetarium, the Dorrance Planetarium that is. Being only one of five of its kind in the world, it is here where you can learn about Arizona skies, black holes, the stars and the planets.   Ever wonder what it's like to be inside a nose or how your boogers are made? Well this is the place where you can find out. You can learn all about your body, technology and the world around you through interactive exhibits and live demonstrations taking place throughout the day. Adults are general $14, kids (3-17) $11 and seniors (62+) are $12. The IMAX theater and the Dorrance planetarium are both extra to the general admission fee.   If you are hungry they have a Fabulous Food cafe that has mostly deli food options and yes, there are some vegetarian options! They do not offer strollers or lockers at the center. They also have a fun little gift shop with everything science (of course) related called Awesome Atoms. If you hate learning in a fun manner, this probably isn't the best place for you.

After viewing this on the Arizona metaphysical site, I decided I wanted to visit this bookstore. It is a new shop in a new location since the old location was burned down. Basically if you have a metaphysical itch, they will scratch it.   It is a good sized store with bookshelves along the walls displaying pretty much any kind of book you could be looking for whether it be Wicca, astral projection, crystal healing, A Course in Miracles, UFO Books, books on Eastern Philosophy, Mystic Christianity, Ancient Scriptures, Bhagavad Gita, Gnosticism, Qabbalah, Reincarnation, Magick,  Demonology, Divination, Numerology, Palmistry, Dreams, Candle-burning, Herbs, Vampires, Aromatherapy, Holistic Healing, Occultism, Metaphysics, Self Help, Crystals, Runes,  Healing  and Massage, Tarot, Astrology, Fairies, Angels and Satanism and much much more. Every potion or spice that you may be looking for is here. They have a good selection of scrying mirrors, crystal balls, jewelry, candles, incense and magazines.   They have classes every month and offer reiki therapy, hypnotherapy, and readings. The store is located between Indian School Rd and Camelback  just south of Meadowbrook Ave. Usually the store is run by Rev. Dr. John Rodgers who is a little strange but that didn't prevent me from shopping, his partner Joy also runs the shop.

This place has been here for over 45 years and a recent visit reminded me of why this place has lasted for as long as it has. Super friendly service and tons of supplies you may need. The store is much bigger than the one that used to be on McDowell. Their specialty is Metaphysics, New Age, Paganism and the occult. We were greeted by Roz and Joy who were super friendly and answered all of our pestering questions. Roz even gave us some cold bottled water because it was so hot outside.  They had lots of different statues, but I came here interested if they had any Buddha statues, prayer flags, mala beads or books on the paranormal, which they had all of them! I pondered over some reiki infused scented candles that were only $2 and $15 handmade goblins. They also have a used section of books which is appreciated because sometimes this stuff can get really expensive.   My partner specifically came here looking for tarot cards which they had in abundance. The ones he ended up liking they had to special order for him, which was nice. If you are looking for essential oils, herbs, kits, graveyard dirt, holy water, charcoal, sage, candles, they have all of that. They also offer readings and classes on things like rootwork, how to read the tarot, candle magick and crystal workshops. The place was a bit confusing to find but it's next to the big tanning shop next door that reads 'TANNING,' and there is a big iron sign that says Alpha Book Center.

Grew up coming here and I love every time coming here. Someone complained that it wasn't that good because their meal which consisted of a side salad was not that "great." Are you kidding me? Who the heck grades a Mexican food place based on a side salad? Whatever. My enchiladas were great, the sauce was excellent and my rice and beans were of excellent moist and flavorful quality. I have always found the rice at Filiberto's to be dry but the rice here is very moist due to their being more tomato sauce in it and a compound called salt.   Try the bakery, there are many excellent pastries to try and the salsa bar has more variety than you can find at the more common walk up Mexican eateries. As for all the comments on the parking lot being shady, honestly in the evening many families come in here to grab something to take home or to have a family meal. Seriously people, the parking lot was clean and well-lit, everything looked freshly painted and clear of trash. Come down off of your high horse and enjoy some good food.

Since my dad is from Panama, he took me to this little restaurant just off of 24th st and McDowell. Since my parents instantly bond with anyone from Central, South America or that speaks Spanish, our service was very good. Although, the owner is very nice and would be cordial to anyone I am sure. My dad used to be a chef in his country but he doesn't cook anymore. When he does it is to die for, but you know men I guess, do something once and you love them for it only for them to never do it again. So it was with that retrospect that he ordered for the both of us.   The cuisines are somewhat similar to what we are used to and it is the use of yuca (aka cassava, manioc root) that stands out the most to me. (Yucca is an ornamental plant that does not have the root of the yuca and is commonly confused with Yuca.) On the menu for appetizers is Yuca frita o sancochada-which is basically the root fried or boiled. There is also the delicious papusas (thick, hand-made tortilla made from masa de ma√≠z that is stuffed with cheese, pork, beans, and green bell peppers or you can get it vegetarian style without pork) that she brought to the table with the traditional curtido- pickled cabbage relish that you eat the papusas with. Then there is the tomato salsa that you can top that off with.  Altogether you could probably make a meal out of these papusas which are a pretty good post bar food if you ask me, but then you would be cheating yourself out of more food! Their fried plantains (starchy fruit) come with sour cream and beans but I like them the way I grew up with; eating them with just sugar sprinkled on both sides.   Some other meals for you meat eaters include:   Filete de Pescado a la Plancha (fish fillet on the grill) that comes with rice, salad and tortillas. Chicken breast on the grill, fajitas, chile relleno and of course quesadillas for dessert. Salvadorian quesadillas are not the same as Mexican quesadillas, it is a cheese pound cake. They also have plantanos fritos con crema y frijoles o con sorbet (fried plantain, beans and whipped cream or with ice cream), flan, or a banana burrito with ice cream.    Their fresh fruit drinks were really tasty as was the Tamarindo. Altogether a small menu but I felt like I was at home, so I will return and bring my gringo boyfriend with me.

I stayed here for one night when I got married for the first time as we had our reception in their reception room. The amenities were standard and altogether pretty good for the price:    wifi, business center, fitness center, heated pool, jacuzzi, breakfast.  Our room came with a jacuzzi and they made sure we had flowers, chocolates, and cider. I love those beds, wow I need to head to the mattress store right now and pick up a new mattress and some massive thread count sheets stat! The towels are pretty small but I just used two and I was fine, considering I am only 125 pounds.   The jacuzzi was nice and my only complaint is there really isn't anything immediately nearby to grab a bite to eat at. There is no room service offered so unless you are satisfied with vending machine snacks, the nearest gas station is a quarter of a mile away. The breakfast in the morning was pretty decent. The interior has been updated and the staff was very accommodating.

You can either dine in or wait outside and order at the order window that is situated outside. While you waiting you can either get a drink at the bar inside or take a short walk to the other bar connected to the restaurant in the back. The waiter service is always great every time I have come here and we always sit in the back in the larger part of the restaurant. It is kinda divey in here as there are no windows, it is just a brick built restaurant and the general atmosphere is dim. However this is good comfort food, the pizza is so good and they use quality ingredients for everything. They also make their own beer which was surprisingly pretty good.

Went here when the Deftones came into town so it was pretty packed. The line snaked around all the way into the parking lot which there was not a lot of. We waited forever to get inside since they were only letting us get in until the last minute before the show was supposed to start. We went to wait in line to get into the bar on the other side and that was a long wait as well. I don't even think they were letting anyone in there either.  I could have done without the ghetto girls behind me, talking about me for no other reason other than they were jealous of me. We waited in that line for what seemed like two hours with girls that were trying to put stuff in my hair. Eventually they started letting people in and the security was so slow and boorish. We got inside and the thing that I liked the most was that the stage rotates so there is not a bad seat in the house.   The seating is extremely close from one another and the rows are crowded. The beer was expensive (but that's to be expected at a concert), and it was very hot inside from the beginning. Altogether, I would not see a concert in this place again unless A Perfect Circle, Tool or if Peter Steele was resurrected and played here. None of which sadly, would ever come true.

Check out the Dorayaki at the Ranch Market, if you get there on time, they make a red bean paste pancake on a griddle in front of the store. Deelish! Go to the Szechwan Palace and request the non-English menu for the true authentic items. The gift shop has tons of gift ideas if you are stumped. I might also mention they have some really, really nice shrines made out of cherry wood and lacquer. I was in the market for one to make my altar and these are the real deal. Beautiful furniture finds, although they can be a bit pricey. They are willing to negotiate with you if you ask.   The store has what you need but the variety may seem lacking in comparison to Lee Lee's or Mekong. Anything you try at the bakery is amazing, if you are in the mood for perfect deco-den like whipped cream cakes, this is the place to get it. Their fruit selection is lacking which is probably my only gripe, but they make up for it in their vegetable selection. The Chinese Herb shop next door is a great place if you are into holistic/Chinese medicine. I wish this place was bigger with more stores, that would definitely put it over the top.

Whooo hoooo! As good as it gets!  What makes a great comic book store? When the people working there aren't a bunch of dicks that ignore you and treat every request like your a friggin' moron. It's when you feel at home browsing around for an hour or more without feeling like your being pushed out or the staff keeps haunting you. I love how I can walk in and ask for the back selection and they bring it out for me. They didn't immediately have what I was looking for (Vault Of Horror comics) but the guy at front went in the back and brought out exactly what I was looking for and put them in nice clear wrapping with card backing and priced them right there for me. No originals, just reprints but who am I to complain? I just want to read the damn thing. Lots of back stock and a nice collection of Creepy and Eerie comics.   Very nice selection of collectibles and busts of superheroes. The store is nice and clean and carefully arranged. Silver Age, EC, DC, Marvel, if your looking for it then you should check here first. Then you should have some dinner at Postino's a short walk over, but that is another review for a different time.

All of my baking needs are met whenever I am baking a cake for someone. If you are building a custom cake, this is the place to start. No matter what kind of cake you are making they will have the supplies for it. I made a NIN cake for my boyfriend awhile back and I needed cake paint, cake stands, and doilies. If you are not sure of where to look they will make suggestions for you.   The only bummer about the place is that they close so dang early. So just make sure you get here during the early part of the day.

I love thrift stores but I'll take my chances elsewhere from this Goodwill location. It is very stereotypical of what you would think a thrift store is:  filthy, cluttered, disorganized, musty smelling, pure junk clothing, and men who will stare you down while you shop.   Good luck trying to find any decent furniture, even some that you don't mind re-finishing! There was not even a couple of nice basic pieces that I could take home and work with. I understand that some people might not have an option, but if you have a car with gas in it go somewhere else. The prices are pretty much the same as a nicer Savers or the like.

Normally I never visit chains as I detest them, but on a Sunday night Mother's Day, there really was nowhere else to go. It was either between this place and Red Devil and I wish we just would have went to Red Devil instead. They do not take reservations but we were pleasantly surprised to find that the wait was non-existent on this night and we were seated right away.  The waiter took our drink orders and my sister was the only one that didn't want lemon in her drink and he was kinda rude about that, something about making his job more difficult or something but whatever. The menu is huge and they have a Skinnylicious menu that features light menu items if you are watching your weight.   Pretty much anything that you could want is on the menu; italian, asian, american, etc. and let's not forget that cheesecake! The cheesecake is the one item where you cannot go wrong. OMG Red Velvet layer cheesecake is 7.95 a slice as they are all aptly priced but it is a huge slice enough for two people.  The mango passion tea is great as were their mixed drinks which are $9.25++  I got the veggie burger which was okay, nothing groundbreaking in flavor or toppings, sauces etc. The fries were a bit disappointing and the food presentation was pretty disappointing and lackluster. My mom got a turkey burger that was incredibly greasy and she was not happy with it. She asked the waiter if he was sure if it was a turkey burger and he assured her it was but again, did not get her something else or offer to take it off of the bill. So somewhat disappointing considering this is Mother's Day and I wanted my mom to at least enjoy her meal.  Summary: Food so-so-may change on a variable basis, Service-abyssmal, we never even got our water glasses refilled, another waitress stepped on my sister's foot but refused to move in a timely manner. I'm going to have to pass on this one unless I need cheesecake in the near future. The validated parking is free with a two hour limit.

I love getting my Pirate Booty from here (the puffs people) and the ready made pizzas, pretty much everything that they have ready made is really good. The store can get pretty crowded, especially during the dinner hour rush.   Employees are friendly and I recommend you take advantage of the samples throughout the store. Come hungry!

I went into this place weirdly expecting Pauly Shore to pop out exclaiming, "Welcome tuu the LUuving HuUt"  Please God no. When this was Supreme Master I knew I was in for a long wait and this is still the case, a party had to get their own menus they grew too impatient. Don't expect to be out of here in 45 minutes or under an hour for that matter.  Vegetarian meals shouldn't be this hard to find and they are not, this is just another option to consider if you are on this side of town. I have found some items on the menu I can cross off, and some I will always make my regular rotation. Service is friendly but be sure to snatch your desserts before you hit the table, otherwise they will be gone by the time you finish your meal. Cheesecake is very popular and is frequently sold out. Just thought you should know that, before the vultures swarm.  The Heaven Rice Rolls $4.00 are okay if you are a fan of the rice paper wrapping, although I did not like the cold, rubbery, not too flavorful texture. The peanut sauce was a compliment to every dish however, and could go on anything (it is supposed to come with a hoisin sauce). The Moo Shu Vegetables $6.95 came differently than how they are supposed to on the menu, it came wrapped tightly again with a rice paper instead of in a wheat Moo Shu skin. Not acceptable.  The Sweet and Sour Divine $8.50 (rice separately white $1.00, brown $1.25) was delicious, a true vegan "junk food" delight. Soy protein, pineapple, carrots, and homemade S&S sauce which I thought they gave me a little too much of but that's okay. It looked like real chicken, tasted like real chicken, and although I have been a vegetarian for 8 years, it was reminiscent of the real thing and recreated that memory for me of eating some S&S Chicken. My mom who is not in anyway shape or form a vegan, was shocked by the taste of the dish (she was a butcher for many years).  The Guru Curry $7.50 is made like a thin Thai curry so don't expect a thick Indian or Chinese curry. It is soupy but it is very good and is served with a crusty loaf of bread. It is composed of: curry, taro, carrots, potatoes, gluten, tofu.  The small trick she offered us about their water is that they cut up a bunch of oranges and put it in the ice water. The Macadamia Carrot Cake $3.95 could have been better if it wasn't so dried out by the refrigerator. It was a delicious cake but they need to throw those out and replace them. With: coconut, carrots, turbinado, sugar, macadamia nuts, spices, coconut cream topping.  Please men in the back who kept farting; I know vegans have a lot of fiber running through the digestive tract at an astronomical rate but farting in a full restaurant is in poor taste. Please excuse yourself and go to the bathroom and fart to your heart's content or take it outside. *Disclaimer-none of the people pictured were the purveyors of the gas.  All items are 100% vegan, all entrees are under $10, all of their delicious organic juices, milks and teas are $3.50-5.00.  It gets busy on weekends and with the already long wait, prepare to wait or come early. Might be hard to pass up but it is right across from Chuy's, and right in the same parking lot as Desert Jade.

This place is better, the beans are made with oil and are just delicious. The rice was moist and flavorful, not to mention the awesome salsa bar they have going on inside. The specials are marked on a board by the counter as you come in. I remember when we used to sneak in burritos in the Harkins Theater just across the way. This is one of the better fast food Mexican restaurants to get you late night fix and they are open 24 hours...

Awesome food! I dream about the falafel from here. I have tried Pita Jungle and many other places, even resorting to making my own but it is never the same as Elie's. Elie is so warm and inviting as she serves you herself. Prices are a little high but so is the quality. The fries are fresh and so is the meat. The pitas are so soft and fresh, very hard to find pitas such as these. I remember I passed out once here, I don't know if it was from a serious disorder or from me being in so much ecstasy from the food! Remember to bring cash, that is their only drawback.

Bad attitudes from the workers, the food is not that great to put up with the mood of this place. This isn't like the soup Nazi from Seinfeld. Sometimes the place is open and sometimes it is not which makes for crappy business.

I have to admit, even though this is a more "ghetto" Ross, they have the best selection for brands. At least that is the case whenever I stop by here. True, you will get stuck for 10-15 minutes waiting in that line to check out but I figure it's worth it in the name of fashion.   The bathroom is a mess, avoid at all costs unless you really, really have to go. The fitting room lady was super sweet, I wanted to take her home. Ok, get your minds out of the gutter.  My boyfriend's style is kind of dark, he only wears all black, expensive dressy clothing and I was able to find some really nice black dress shirts for him that were 8.99 and up. They have these impulse items that you just cannot resist like iPad accessories, car interior accessories etc. I bought some Hello Kitty clamshell headphones for 8.99.  Be patient with lines and people at times, you will be rewarded with cheap goodies.

It takes management several weeks to a month to finish or begin repair requests. When it does finally get done, it's sub-par. Children are very noisy and are allowed to go unattended. I don't know about the rest of the apartment complex but my neighbors are very rude and noisy. Several complaints have done no good. By account in any GOOD complex they would have been evicted a long time ago. It appears after only a few months of living here, that anyone can get away with anything here.  People leave garbage around the complex, and the laundry room is terrible. Crummy washers and dryers, and they expect people to pay $1 each. Plus there are only 3 for the whole complex so sometimes you cannot get any laundry done. Walls are very thin. I know when living in apartments you are going to get some noise but this is ridiculous! Rent is high for these outdated (asbestos popcorn ceiling), old apartments. Which would explain the need for constant repairs. Bathroom is very tiny, allowing for very little movement. I don't know if they are trying to save money, but they are going about it the wrong way by cutting off the lights way too early so the complex is pitch black in the morning when I go to work. Arms outstretched is how big it is.  Recently since I don't live here anymore, my brother and sister moved in and some pedophile tried to lure my sister back to his apartment! After calling the police it turns out he is related to the owners or some type of garbage like that.  We had extensive flood damage that destroyed thousands of dollars in furniture due to the upstairs neighbor having a washer when it is forbidden. Numerous times this happened where the water would come flooding down from the light alcove in the kitchen. Finally there was one huge flood where we had to move out for a couple of weeks until everything could dry and things could get put back into place and they FINALLY evicted the man after dealing with his crap for over a year.   The sauna does not work and the parking is extremely tiny with one one way in and out. Sometimes people will park in your space! The few things I liked were they were gay friendly apartments, behind Di Vito's restaurant, across the street from 7-Eleven and down the street from Savers. There is access to the Arcadia area but do yourself a favor and go a little bit further to rent, these apartments are a dump.

I would not recommend this company, sometimes it just pays to pay more extra $$ for the quality of service and assurance of getting what you paid for. We hired Two Men for a total of 4 hours. Three men showed up and they had us sign some paperwork and went to work. However, they took MANY breaks and since it was an apartment complex that we moved out of, I could not see what they were doing only I know it does not take that long each time to load a few boxes into a truck parked 50 feet away. Eventually I came outside to see what was taking so long, to see them drinking and talking in the parking lot. What the heck? I understand it is still hot outside in November but it's not that damn hot, and it's completely unnecessary to take that many breaks.  Eventually we are on the road and arrive at the house and everything went at an acceptable pace. Two of the men took a bathroom break which was fine but when the time came to pay the bill, they charged us for another increment of time even though the man admittedly stated that we only went over by 5 minutes! Something about it being "policy" to charge another increment if even only over by a few minutes. I think if they wouldn't have been taking so many damn breaks they would have finished on time.   Even though customer service was sympathetic, they didn't offer a refund of the additional increment. A manager called us a few days later and seemed angry that his employees had been slacking off, however I didn't want to bother with the issue anymore so I told him it was fine. I will listen to the reviews more closely the next time I move and avoid this business like the plague.

When they showed up, they did not come at the scheduled time and I had to leave. When they showed up again for the new scheduled time the next day, they again came way too early. Several hours early in each case. The second time they woke me up because they came so early when they should have been there at 1 pm. Again, like some reviews stated, it was hard to communicate with the workers who spoke very little English. One of the workers had to call someone to translate which is not a huge deal, but it made things difficult. When I called to complain about the errors in appointment times, I too experienced the rude customer service people on the phone. I would do more research in order to hire a more trusted lawn care company.

Yes, I love Gateway community college. I first received college credits from here while I was in high school. The set buildings are indoors so if you are taking general classes the main building is an indoor facility, and that is where the cafeteria and main computer labs are. The health programs building is indoors as well so it is a much welcome relief in the summer here in sweltering Arizona.   The teachers here are great, I received my Health Unit Coordinating certificate from here. All of the health programs are extensive but you learn a lot and there is a sense of community at this school. They offer a lot of lucrative programs here such as x-ray technician programs, nursing, respiratory ect.

You will love attending school with the mountains in the backdrop. Smaller school than the other community colleges but that may be the charm of this place. They are building a new library and there is a whole host of restaurants across the canal so you can hang out on your lunch time or take a run along the canal.

Normally I don't review Subway's but this time I felt I must. We came here late with a craving for subs. Everything was going okay, me waiting in car until fiance comes out and says please tell me you brought your purse and I said no, we ran out of the house and I brought nothing! Well apparently he forgot his wallet and went back in to tell them that we would have to return. They said it was okay and gave it to us anyway. Now I don't suggest that anyone try anything to get anything for free but it was a very nice gesture. When we came back to the store to pay, they said that's okay! Awesome people work here!

Purses. Junk  Jewelry. Junk  Shoes. Junk  I came here specifically looking for purses and what they had were either soccer mom or old granny purses. I saw some purses that were a little better but they were over-priced. I think even Walmart has a better and nicer selection of jewelry and that is not saying very much. Shoe selection was shabby, not a looker in sight.

Super friendly service at this location and it's never busy. I don't know why every single Sally's that I have been to, I have always been given attitude by the workers. There was only one girl working but she was friendly and didn't hover. The whole strip mall is a great place to do your errands.

Like others have mentioned, it is a little more than difficult to find employees to help you. I stopped by this location closest to me to pick up a microwave. Some of the models we wanted to see were not on display, so that was a bummer. There was no one around to ask any questions, it was like a graveyard. However, since we had done our research online, we pretty much knew what they looked like and just selected the one that we wanted based on YouTube videos. We used our reward points to get $15 off. I recommend the Chandler location more, which has its own hits and misses, but at least I've experienced more "hits" there.

I want some Buono's right now :(  I like that this place is divey with a huge flat screen television and a bunch of junk on the walls. Also it is pretty dim in here so you can pig out in relative anonymity, well not really it's not that dark in here but you get the picture. Pizza was pretty good and they sell slices if you don't want to commit to a whole pizza. So far so good, that's really all I have to say since I only tried the pizza. PIzza slices are 1.95 and .50 for each topping.

I love you Cheba, I want to make love to you like when Kumar made love to that giant ass bag of weed in Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle. Anyway to get away from that, I love my Griefo with its pepper jack, hemp cream cheese, guacamole, sprouts, lettuce, black olives, onions, mushrooms, cucumbers, pickles, & tomatoes. You can really taste that tasty hemp. Bonus to some of the cute, white guys working there. However, the guy working the register was irritatingly slow. Like snail slow, taking forever to complete an order. It made me wonder what was making him so relaxed...

Still the best Cheba in the area! Everyone is extremely friendly and laid back (gee, I wonder). Make a night of it: go to school at MCC, come eat here (don't forget the brownie and fruity pebble rice crispy treats), and shop at Shirts 'N' Things. I still adore you like Kumar adores his bag of weed.

I love the cramped cluttered feeling of Shirts 'n' Things. Eh, where to start I love the belt buckles they keep in the case since I am a belt buckle person and they have some cool and beautiful belt buckles. Cool lighters, stickers, posters, gothic hair accessories, hats and even cute baby outfits with a metal or gothic twist. Huge music memorabilia selection to choose from whether it is shirts, posters, stickers, bags, patches, and hats.   They have a great shoe selection from Demonia, creepers, and boots. Nice purses as well near the back of the store. There is way too much to look at in one shopping trip, just take your time and do one section at a time. Nice assortment of jewelry and altogether weird items. Right across the street from MCC, next to Cheba Hut and Subway.

Ah, good 'ol standby Village Inn, where else could I, a quasi-nut case get great food at such a late hour?   The manager misses us when we are not there to envelope the place with our gloominess. The service is really great and the food is always good. This is a much better choice over Denny's because they are cheap and the food portions are better than Denny's. Good place to wander over to after coming out of Shirt's 'n' Things.  I recommend the pie. It's free on Wednesdays

I cannot believe how many times I have passed this place by, looking at the truck with the logo painted on it sitting outside. The name has changed after the owner retired this year, but the daughter of the owners took over and runs the place. It is still in the exact same location but they extended their hours to stay open an hour later. Great news for us!   This was a pleasant change from all of the cookie cutter Spirit stores we have been to in the valley. Once you step in, you are overwhelmed (in a good way promise!) by costumes and merchandise. The far left wall is filled with masks, if you are looking for something affordable or collectible, they have it. The customer service rep who I believe is the husband, was extremely helpful and enthusiastic about the merchandise and Halloween in general. He knew exactly what I was talking about when I asked him which studio made a particular Michael Myers mask that I was looking at. (They have Trick Or Treat Studios!). There is a private back room that at first I thought might contain adult material that he led us into, but it's really only gory type items (damn!) and you have to ask to be let in.   Inside the room, it was dimly lit with a red bulb and he had set up a meat case full of body parts, serial killer flesh face masks were on the wall, many kinds of skulls, monster props, and smaller accessories were inside. Prices were very reasonable, the masks in the serial killer series were only $15. There were of course, tons of packaged costumes for just about anything you could think of. Balloon sales are in the back and I spotted so many awesome Nightmare Before Christmas balloons, and Halloween themed balloons. They don't even need to be for Halloween, they could be a great gift for someone who loves horror? He had so much stuff he was only happy to show us, so run, don't walk to check this place out.   *Park in front, back entrances are closed off. Entrance located next to Starbucks entrance.

I made the mistake(??) of coming here two weeks in a row, I couldn't get enough of the food, and I paid the price in terms of the scale.  Now, back down from the few pounds I gained, I realize I need to enjoy this place in moderation. Oscar and Doug are the serious assets to this place, I am not sure if one of them is an owner, but they are both extremely welcoming and conversational. The place itself is on the small side, but they never seem to get swamped at any time so there is plenty of seating.  Onto the food, the hamburgers themselves are just as other people have pretty much described them: good backyard bbq quality. You get a pretty decent sized patty, the seasoning is light but adequate, they seem to want the meat to speak for itself. The combination of the two very thick slices of cheddar, extra thick/creamy mayonnaise, lettuce, tomato, meat and toasted bun is one word: fatty heaven.  The hamburgers are served with seasoned fries, and they serve pies! There was no way I was having pie after that meal I ate, but I may try some next time. They do have delicious healthy options like chicken/Boca/Gardenburger/grilled fish sandwich. My only suggestions are to offer a fried fish sandwich and perhaps, a more true milkshake. Otherwise, this place is definitely on my list of consistent places, like Haji Baba's for example!

The perfect little farmer's market and their produce is so fresh because obviously, it comes right off the farm. The customer service is very friendly and I believe all the workers are family. Prices are very reasonable, and they just about offer any kind of vegetables, fruits, nuts, honey (local), milk, hot sauces, and just about anything you could want. Make a day out of visiting the farm and then go on over to the market to purchase some yummy local produce!

I don't know what the last guy was talking about, Netflix only costs about 8.99 a month but whatever. This place is pretty big with New Releases all along the wall and of course movies are categorized by genre in long tall aisles. You will probably spend about 30-60 minutes here each time deciding on what to get since they have such an extensive collection. Every old movie that you grew up watching in the 80's is probably here. There is even an adult section to your right when you walk in.  They have a movie special everyday where if you rent 5 movies, it is $5 for 5 days (does not include New Releases). In addition, if you rent 3 you get the 4th free. Although, I don't know why you wouldn't just get the 5 movie deal but whatever. They even offer a little snack section at the front desk that includes many nostalgic candies. Game rentals are offered here as well as Blu Ray's.   The staff here is very friendly and they are always willing to look up a movie and find it for you. This place kind of reminds me of the now closed Scottsdale Video if any of you have ever been there. A video store out of the 80's but with DVD's.

We are still heading down here to Chandler from Phoenix even though we have moved far away. It's nostalgic because you can't find anything like this anymore anywhere. The only thing that comes close is Superstar Video in Phoenix but it's not as good as Paradise.  *10,000 movies-All new releases, old movies, 80's horror and recent movies, cult classics, Criterion Collection. *Video game rentals and a sweet adult section. *Cotton candy and junk food! Food of the gods. *Old arcade games.  *5 movies for $5, 5 nights.  *They even have the controversial movies; Salo, Cannibal Holocaust selection, Irreversible, Nekromantik, Martyrs, Audition, etc. *They order movies for you provided it's not some lame movie or TV show season they feel no one will rent but you. I love the Criterion Collection which they have a lot of (Kwaidan, Akira Kurosawa films etc) they ordered Hausu for me! *You will get to know everyone who works here and they are super nice.   Please help keep local businesses like this open!

A new year, it's still here, and my reviews still stands. IF you are in your twenties, then you may remember video stores, but not the glossy ho-hum Blockbuster variety, this place has soul. From the private porn section, old arcade video games, nostalgic video collection, and staff movie picks playing on tv's throughout the store, to the witty/sarcastic/hilarious video clerks who will chat you up about movies, Video Paradise has it all. I hope places like this never go away like Scottsdale Video did. Might I also mention I have the teeniest bit of a crush on all of the employees?

The price is very reasonable compared to the large size of gelato you get. Keeping in mind that gelato is not like ice cream and is very dense so you will need less of it. You might think that little bit of gelato is not going to be enough but it is, in fact you might be hard pressed to finish it! I love the way the display case is set up when you walk in, it is kept very clean and everything looks delicious. We had the double chocolate and the butter pecan which was to die for.

This Big Lots is a clean and organized store unlike a lot of others I have been to. It is a great place to buy frames at, I bought some very nice art frames from here to frame my photography to give as a gift and they looked very expensive. The furniture that they receive are from name brand companies and are very nice, I wouldn't mind picking up something from here for very cheap than you would find at your regular furniture store.   This is the best place to purchase your cleaning supplies, toiletries and trash bags because they are cheaper here than at the store. You might find something you like in the food section and did I mention they also carry makeup and beauty supplies which are all name brand? Never take anyone with you who gets aggravated easily by shopping because you will take forever in here looking at this and looking at that.

I prefer Petsmart better because they have a better selection and prices. I like Petco for their cookie bar so I can pick up some cookies that are friendly for pets for my pets. That's basically it, I only shop here on occasion because of the location. Go to Pets Inc in Tempe instead for a real shopping experience.

Very clean store, I was pleasantly surprised to see that everything was nicely organized. The store smells clean unlike what you're probably used to. The aisles are nicely spaced so it gives you room to pass by without having to "wait" the other person out. I always see so many restoration projects in the furniture section when I go here.   *50% off Saturdays *Sign up online for their emails, they send a 20% off coupon each month with $10 or more purchase. *Students like me get 25% off on Sundays with ID *Senior day is Tuesday with ID 25% *Every other day is 50% with special color tags except Thursday where special color tags are $1!  I take a star off because it's not the most spectacular location and because it is always sweltering in there.

I love this place, very consistent all of the time and very friendly service. Only place around here that offers a drive-thru. The portions are always big and everything always comes fresh on big platters. You can upgrade your meal to the Manager's Special for $1.50 and get a drink and egg-rolls. It is housed in an ironic location; surrounded by gyms.

This place has been here for over 22 years so they must be doing something right. This is a great hole in the wall Chinese restaurant that is not 'genuine' Chinese food but Americanized Chinese food done right.   Your old standbys are here as are all of the old familiar items you have come to memorize on Chinese menus. Super cheap, I recommend if you like spice then tell them to make any of your dishes 'extra spicy.' Not the most amazing Chinese food but perfectly adequate and you're not going to spend an arm and a leg if you find you don't like the place. Another similar restaurant in the area is Wang's Delight.

Chase's Diner looks good from the outside but once you are inside the food tells a different tale. One of foreboding tasteless potatoes and overall breakfast. Hey, maybe I'm wrong, I haven't been here in awhile because the first time was enough but I am willing to give it another try. Maybe.  Now I'm not one of those sodium nuts who salt their food before they have even tasted it, but the food here is pretty much without flavor and I thought it was pretty much impossible to mess up breakfast. On a lark, I ordered the fried okra just to try to make my breakfast seem interesting. It was so slimy it was off putting and the breading was void of any flavor. I know okra and slime pretty much go together but if cooked properly, you can eliminate the sliminess.   Altogether everything was pretty much disappointing. I guess the old saying still holds true; you can't judge a book by its cover. In this case, nice cover, but what's inside is not so good.

Yay for bubblegum ice cream! If you are an 8 year old trapped in an adults body then you will appreciate the novelty of such a place. A mix between being a water and ice type of store, they also have ice cream by the scoop and tons of drinks to choose from. They offer free wifi or you can use one of their computers at the computer station. They have a big screen TV to pass the time. The service was excellent and is the perfect stopover for a quick treat. If you remember the nostalgic drugstore treat fondly, I recommend you stop by.

I love Lee Lee's, where else can I buy accessories for my hair and buy a Durian all at the same time? It is pretty much a agglomeration of foods from different cultures and regions from around the world. They have fresh fish in the back near the meat section, and by fresh I mean still swimming in tanks fresh. There is also a station where you can purchase a whole or half Peking duck for dinner.  I love the alcohol and freezer section where you can find red bean buns and dumplings. If you arrive earlier in the day, there is a jewelry shop that sells beautiful jade and gold inside the store. You can also find collectibles and rent Asian movies off to the right side of the market when you enter the store. (sorry there is nothing in English)   Big beautiful bags of pearl rice is at the front of the store for all of your rice stocking up needs. There is also a remedy and herbal section near the front left of the store with a wide selection. Beyond that there is a delicious restaurant Saigon Pho that you can enter through the store.

They have some sunglasses that seriously lasted a trip through the Salt River on a day trip. This is also after being dashed on some rocks. That was the purpose of our trip, to purchase items that we did not mind getting ruined. I also picked up some Marilyn Monroe sandals that are still in use as we speak and the graphic has not come off yet! YAY  I do not think I would purchase their produce or other fresh items. I know stores like Food City gets lower quality produce than say Safeway or Sprouts, so I can only imagine what kind of quality the .99 store receives. Besides it did not look very good anyway, everything looked old. They have tons of sauces and boxed food items. Aluminum balloons blown up are only a dollar each so you can give someone a bouquet of balloons for $10 and they are nice just like the regular store.   I came here to pick up supplies to make candy and rose leis for my sister's high school graduation. I made everything for under $15, which included: two candy leis with really good candy, ribbon, clear cellophane wrap, Disney rattles and silk roses. She was the envy of everyone. They had a wide selection of cards, wrapping paper, ribbon and tissue paper. The store seemed organized so I will visit again.

Super owner who loves his customers, I saw this bitch in there giving him a hard time while I was there and I wanted to rip into her. Now where else would you see customers so protective of a local restaurant owner if it weren't so good?  Best orange chicken ever, the sauce actually tingles your tongue and it doesn't taste generic. His wife actually uses real oranges and it is so refreshing. The miso soup is so good and filling as are their rice bowls. They use very beautiful pearl rice in their rice bowls not just regular long-grain rice here. The Japanese very much value the quality of the rice and it shows here.  The owner asked me specifically if the food was good because as he put it to my partner, "I always ask the woman if the food is good because they would know better about good quality food."

Awesome service at this location, I came in the evening on a Thursday if that makes a difference in the service some have reported. They sold me their Halloween town displays at a discount and threw in a free light kit! I could honestly spend hours in here looking at supplies for art projects, it's usually not very busy at all. Sign up for the email coupons or look them up online. They should take them right off of your smartphone.

Hi, welcome to Best Buy!!  sdfasdhfljkdsh  That's the only response they get from me, a response so vague it really is just a sound. No customer service whatsoever, like the other reviewer said, two employees were chatting and we were standing looking right at them wondering where iPad cases were and they looked and continued chatting! hmmm???  Using the powers of walking and sight, we were able to locate them but I still think we should have had some type acknowledgment. Pretty basic like much all of the other Best Buy's. I would recommend Fry's Electronics where although the employees can be just as idiotic, at least there is a way better selection of what you need.

I don't know what went wrong with this place. The many times we have been here before the service was great now it has slowly gone downhill. One waitress we had a few occasions ago was excellent. She was friendly, took our order in a reasonable time, brought us sauces in adequate amounts (I hate it when they give you a dinky portion that you know you're just going to end up asking for more soon), we never needed to flag anyone down and she came over frequently but not too frequently to see if we were doing okay.  The last few times were terrible. I think this is either the result of inadequate management or disorganization by everyone. Possibly both, okay I must watch too many Kitchen Nightmares or something. One time we were seated to the right of the restaurant when you come in, by the bar area. A girl came and took our drink orders, myself partaking in an endless root beer float (only a little over $3 I might add) and my partner ordering a margarita. Some time passed (10 min) and then we had to flag someone down to get them to bring us our drinks. Margarita was disappointingly small for the price but root beer float was fabulous as usual, they forgot the spoon which also had to be flagged down for.  Ordering time comes which was during the span of time waiting for drinks and so forth. Food takes awhile to come out, meanwhile the waitress is serving as the bartender for the whole restaurant making drinks one after another while waiters whiz by in and out carrying drink orders and we are left wondering when can we get a refill and where is our food? Food finally comes and someone else brings it and we discover my partner's food is cold. Sent it back and it comes back better but the whole experience was aggravating, no set server for a table and to keep flagging down people for things. It was like the equivalent to being seated next to the bathroom or kitchen, forgetful service and confusing, crowded and busy servers rushing by.  The next time we came they tried to sit us there again! We replied with a resounding NO and the girl looked very "butthurt" for lack of a more flavorful word. We explained why but she didn't seem to be too concerned. We sadly looked at the people who were sitting in that area, aware of the service they were about to receive. Finally we ended up where we wanted to sit and the server was just okay, not very friendly. I hate it when I look at other tables in a restaurant and I see their servers are way more friendlier than mine and then I end up having "server envy."   Summary: weekends are very crowded, if you are only two people they might try to stick you in the "forgetmenot" area. Families and larger groups they seem to move to the main dining area as I noted. I think I'm just going to find another location. Although I dislike chains mostly, Red Robin is a decent place to grab a burger $8-11 and don't forget those bottomless fries.

All I can say is that the drinks are pretty stiff in price and in strength so at least you get what you pay for. However, I typically hate chains and CPK is no different in being overpriced for the miniscule and okay tasting food that you receive. However, I would not rank it as terrible, their pizzas are pretty tasty but everything else is kinda lackluster.

I agree with the last reviewer, this Baja is going downhill. Baja was always  like the more beautiful, delicious cousin of Rubio's (if you consider your cousin delicious). I received my quesadilla and while it usually has a few types of cheeses in it, this one had some rubbery cheese in it with very little cheese in it, like they were cutting back or something. The queso fundido tasted fake, like a plastic doll accidentally dripped overhead into it or something. Ehh, I don't think so...

Sad and disgusted I will never come here again...  I went for the first time to Pf Changs last night with the suspicion that I shouldn't because I hardly ever eat at chains because they are generally overpriced, over-hyped and have poor quality of food while trying to pretend that it is so hip. Boy was I ever right and this just goes to tell you that you should always listen to that little voice in the back of your head instead of the louder one in your stomach. Instead of going to a noodle house where everything is made fresh my partner and I opted to come here because it was in the parking lot of the mall where we were and he was ravenous.   Decor is nice et cetera, et cetera, and I ordered a glass of Malbec and some spring rolls. When the rolls arrived, they looked like they came out of the freezer bag and the sauce tasted like it did too. Not only that, but they did not even taste as good as the freezer rolls do lol. Completely void of taste and the only highlight was the arrival of my slightly chilled Malbec.  I ordered the vegetable lo mein and my partner ordered the mongolian beef. His arrived looking fine, nothing extraordinary and mine arrived looking like someone had gone out and purchased one of those Yakisoba noodle packs and just plopped it into a white plate. It didn't come with any rice and the lame oil and pepper trio they tout wasn't very good. The broccoli was undercooked and it was completely void of flavor. I was so pissed off that for a small ass portion which sucks by the way, they charge you $9 which you could get somewhere else at a mom and pop operation for about a buck less and it tastes so much better.  Good service but that's not enough to save their lackluster food, maybe just this one in Chandler sucks. Either way, I don't really want to find out.

No way, go to All About Books and Comics better. This chain is only good for children and the casual comic book reader, not if you are a serious collector like me. No good selection on graphic novels and no selection in the horror genre.

One of the more decent Fry's to shop at in Tempe thus far. I never realized before how much I took Chandler for granted before I moved to this area, like others mentioned there are some dumpy DUMPY places around here and it's hard to find decent places to shop sometimes. Clean, big, throw some furniture, some Redboxes and a nice houseplant section in the mix and that about sums it up. Also they seem to give everyone the senior discount late at night which is strange but who am I to argue with savings??

If you know how to cook, you should have a good time at YC's. Your meal is basically what you make of it, and although the bowl may be on the medium side, you will shortly find that this makes for a huge meal. I could not even finish mine and had leftovers to take home. They encourage you to pile it as high as you can get it, then I added two bowls of sauce, one spicy and one Mongolian and it came out great. Perfectly sauced, and not thin and soupy like some have stated.   The only thing I didn't really like was the frozen fish, it just did not work well with the stir fry. Bonus if you are tired of take-out consisting of mostly bell pepper pieces and not enough meat, you can make your whole bowl consist of meat, sauce, and rice! (Not that I condone such behaviour).  I thought the ice cream was going to be an icy afterthought like most buffets, but it was actually pretty good so I had two like a big pig. I wouldn't call it gourmet but I would call it decent takeout quality.

I love you Sunflower because you are much more interesting than godawful Sprouts. The bread selection is great, there is just about any bread that you need and some that you didn't even realize the possibility of. When you are not near a Bevmo and you need foreign libations, you should definitely check out Sunflower because they have an awesome beer selection. I'm a vegetarian so I like the fact that there are more options here than there are at Sprouts and they don't charge you an arm and a leg like the latter or worse, Whole Foods.

When there is a movie you have been longing to see comes out in the IMAX, take the plunge and go see it. Sure it's a bit pricey $30 for two people and a few dollars more for glasses if it's in 3D, but it's well worth it when you sit smack dab in the middle of the theater and this huge screen is towering over you forebodingly.   On the plus side, I've noticed that paying more for tickets will keep out the riffraff, noting the people that talk during a movie, carry on and generally aggravate the hell out of you. Hmmm something about paying $15 pp vs. $9.50 seems to shut people up real quick.   If you're like me and need an 80' tv at home to be satisfied, then the IMAX is for you.

Huge store, it's basically like one mega Ross. The merchandise is pretty much the same but there is more of it to choose from, and the prices are pretty similar. If I am looking for something that Ross doesn't have, I usually trek over here to find it. Watch out for those pushy sales people on the way though!  This place is great for looking for gifts at this time of year especially. They have a huge assortment of slippers, purses, perfume, jewelry, toys, fragrances, coats, housewares, baby items, clothes, packaged food, and smaller item furniture. You can find some really good deals on expensive coats for way less. I seem to never be able to leave without buying junk food, or jewelry. Oh, and let's not forget the huge selection of shoes!

You can find so many good gifts in here to give away. I signed up for their emails so I get the info on when they are having sales or have gotten something new in the store.  You can find polished gemstones, mineral specimens, beads, jewelry, magnetic bracelets, salt lamps, fossils, jewelry making supplies, and huge, giant geodes. This is a great place to take a Geology buff. I am always able to walk into the store and name every rock and gemstone, nerdy I know.  I always go in for their incense, cool incense holders, tribal masks, and hematite rings. Large selection of petrified wood, drums, wind chimes, and wall ornaments. The staff that works there is very friendly as well. Always a great place to stop by in the mall. Did I mention their prices are ridiculously cheap?

I have had hit and miss service at this location in the past, but it seems like they are more on top of their game. You can literally walk in here with any kind of project in mind and they can help you. We also came in here for light bulbs, and an associate took the time to explain all the different types of bulbs and helped us pick out the type that we needed. I smashed a picture frame by accident one time, and since they cut glass too I was able to save my picture. It's pretty nice to walk into a hardware store and not have to walk a couple of football fields just to get what you need. There's not much walking to do if they show you exactly where an item is. They usually have pretty good sales around Thanksgiving and Christmas, especially for Black Friday.

Pricey but I have always had friendly service whenever I have come here. I petted a hissing cockroach at this location, it's in the photos. eww  They don't specialize in all animals anymore, mostly reptiles, fish and amphibians. They carry crickets and mice, rats for feeding purposes.

A great place to come if you are in need of a wig or many wigs! Seriously, they have a pretty decent selection of wigs. The customer service was pretty friendly and they let you try on the costumes before you buy. The Halloween selection is small compared to other locally owned shops in the area. However, I would return here for party supplies.

This is the go-to place to get a good hot dog. I mean we really are not flush with hot dog places everywhere you look, and they serve burgers too! Any type of sausage, dog, or brat you can think of. They grill it the way you want it too, so if you want it burnt, speak up! They use Aunt Hattie's bread which is okay in my book. It usually gets loud and crowded which is atmosphere here. It's basically the Subway of hot dogs (well, maybe Subway isn't cool enough, let's say Cheba Hut), you tell them what you want on it after it's done grilling. The onion rings are huge!

The gentlemen here are always honest, fast, and never try to upsell us ever. I note this very highly because I become very angry when service people try to sell me on something I don't need, or tell me I need to replace something that is light years beyond needing to be replaced. On more than a few occasions, the manager gave us a discount or went out of his way to find us a cheaper but adequate option when we needed it. I don't know what else to say without coming off like some kind of cheesy commercial, but I'm glad I have a reliable tire shop since in this day and age, honesty is hard to come by!

Good location, I always receive the help I need when I'm at Lowe's in comparison to Home Depot. Don't forget your coupons!

We always stop here for the pies as we leave or are coming into town. Pecan sticky buns for $2.50? Yes, please. And these are huge, about the size of two hands put together side by side. The breakfast, eh not so much. I have stopped here a couple of times and I try to avoid coming here for breakfast, it's always a tad cold and the potatoes lack serious flavor.   We came here for dinner once expecting the same but it was actually great. My macaroni and cheese had a nice cracker parmesan crust on it, the sauce was made with real cheese, and the biscuit dumplings were soft, fresh, and very creamy. The pies really take the cake, worth it every time. Pick up a whole one for $18-20 and just tell everyone you made it! Of course if they want more, I guess you're out of luck.

Challenger Space Center is one of those places to go if you are a: astronomy, NASA, space, astrophysics, or science nut. With a special emphasis on NASA and space. I started coming here way back when I was a young student on a quest to become an aerospace engineer. There is an indoor planetarium and there are three levels of exhibits and memorabilia  They offer guided tours and stargazing evenings and their two hour flight simulated missions require a reservation for an additional fee. I also saw some fliers for birthday parties, apparently they host birthday parties for your little geek or geekette. We walked around, I saw an astronaut suit entombed behind some glass. The gift shop has loads of things all related to space, all freeze dried foods, space games, toys etc. This place is just far enough there never seems to be anyone else there.   The space missions are very educational and fun. Rendezvous with a comet is every Sat and you work together on a team to successfully meet up with the comet's tail. Voyage to Mars is every third Sat and you work as the first flight crew on Mars.

Even though they have some interesting stuff in store, the service is lacking severely. Next door to Savers, we came in looking for remote helicopters. The owner had to bitch at his teenage son to get him to come help us. We come back to next day to purchase one and he tells us after it has rung up that there is a sale on helicopters that day.   Well gee, I would have liked to have know that before so perhaps I could have picked out a better, more expensive model. He didn't really offer any info on anything but just kept flying that helicopter all over the store. Just really bad immature service and their selection is not the most extensive I have seen, but I was really interested in the items they offered in the store.

I love the old brick buildings and the huge library that makes you feel like you are in an actual regular library. I love the art department, when you come into the area it is located centrally and has a dark, cool tunnel-like hallway. This is a very diverse school so you got to love that about it. Get involved in as many clubs and activities as I did! This is a great school that has that mini-university feeling like the other reviewer said.

The fry bread in itself was great, it is just what goes inside it is not that great. I have been wanting to come here for a long time since I have heard so much about it. I got a bean and cheese fry bread and the beans came half smashed with whole pinto beans in it, which I can't stand. The beans are not very flavorful when they are whole. The cheese was a thick shred which didn't melt and it was altogether disappointing.   My partner got the fry bread with ground beef which he said was not flavorful at all. It was like they just cooked the beef with no flavoring at all. Maybe they were having a really off night? Yelp, why have you been betraying me lately? I keep going to these great reviewed places and they suck.

Okay I have come around, the Fry Bread House rocks! maybe I just went on a bad night or something...anyways after a few hours of trekking in the Heard Museum, we became very hungry looking at all of food and more specifically, fried food exhibits. Knowing that this place is Tohono O'odham Nation family owned, it was a no-brainer to stop in here for our fry bread cravings. You can see the women in the back stretching out the dough getting it ready for its hot oil bath.  I recommend you take your time to order because there is so much to choose from. They also want you to shut your trap on your celly while ordering, so please put it away in the name of order accuracy. Why do you have to be so fattening fry bread?? Why??!? Tasty fillings and the  bread itself is slightly chewy without being too chewy, and has a fried, fresh, goodness about it. Try the red cream soda, it ties it all together.

Great location, I love the grunginess of this place. You could literally look for hours and still not cover base in this place. There is something for every bibliophile, techie, nerd, pop culture fan, and music lover. We sometimes come here to scope for cheap movies to watch, it's the same price as renting from Amazon, Vudu, Playstation, and Redbox. Only you get to keep the movie, which may or may not be a good thing depending on the movie.   They have whole aisles of pop culture junk you don't need but can't be without. My only gripe is that the organization in the back is no bueno. We had to wait until after closing just so they could find cables for a game system we had just bought. The customer service is always great at any Zia's I have been to. Sure you can get the same stuff online but you don't actually get to see it in your hands, and walk away with your purchase immediately. Plus, I like to people watch and this location is great for that. It gets a bit 'rough' around here late at night. 4 for $1 books? I'm sold.

I love this place so much I would love to move to the area and volunteer. I came here to get my therapy pet which happens to be a guinea pig named Clark and while we were there we could not resist a rat named ratatouille so we snatched her up as well. I could not help but take forever looking at all of the darling pets and feel so sad that I could not take all of them home with me. The employees are very much as in love with pets as I am and you can tell that each and every one of them is an avid animal lover and not just some person who is working there because it's a job to them.   The person who helped us let us take our time petting each pig and getting a feel for each animal. He even played with the rat for what seemed like an extended amount of time. Don't expect to waltz in here and waltz on out of here in 15 minutes, you really want to make sure you feel a connection to the animal so just sit there and play and hold the animal. The employees will tell you all you need to know about the animal's history and demeanor. Plus they want to make sure that they are going to suitable homes so you will need to fill out an application and if you live in apartments make sure you go and adopt while your apartment complex office is open because they will need to call and make sure that you are allowed to have pets in your complex, no exceptions.  The staff is so friendly and we were even able to purchase an extra cage for $12! If you know small animal cages you recognize that this is a steal for a new, moderate sized animal cage. The facilities are very nice for an adoption center, there is a gift shop for your new pet so you can pick up beautiful collars and pet dishes ect. I think you even get a discount when you adopt a pet. Each animal has their own section and there are rooms where they will put in in with the pet and play with them. As I was leaving I couldn't help myself and took Clark out at the car so I could cuddle him, an employee was going home and stopped and chatted with me and was very nice as she was happy to see Clark going home. I also like that they provide you with a free vet exam and expenses paid (if needed) up to $500 for any conditions the pet might have although they are thoroughly taken care of at the shelter. The appointment just needs to be made within 5 days at any VCA hospital that they will give you a flyer for in your adoption packet. I will be back here again.

I was searching the Fry's inventory online for a hard drive for my new PS4 and it said on the website that this store had it. Since I never trust anyone or anything, I called the store to double check before I drive 25 miles out of my way to pick it up. Apparently they don't check on inventory anymore by phone as I am told by the message, you have to check the website and if it says it is in stock, it will be there at the store. Okay drive down there..and surprise they don't have it!  Associate: Oh, it looks like they have one in the back but it is defective.  Me: What do you mean defective? What's wrong with it, I drove this whole way. Associate: It's defective. Oh but we have this in stock (names off something that is completely not what I am looking for, has nothing to do with anything). Me: Can I speak to a manager? Manager: Well it looks like we had an employee test out that defective drive and it seems to be working okay, do you want it? Me: Hell no! what tested it out for these last few minutes and I'm supposed to trust that?What do you have to say for me driving this whole way when the website says you guys have it and you don't allow people to call and check? Can you offer me a discount? Manager: No, you should have placed an order on the website to hold it here for you so that way it would have been here. Me: What the hell would that have done? Ordered a defective drive? because that's what you told me you have here in stock. Have you suffered a mild stroke? That makes no sense whatsoever.  So there you have it, no customer service and no organization. Heck who cares about getting some sort of discount, offering some troubleshooting to solve the situation and an apology would have made me a happy camper. I really don't like the Baseline location either because of it's unknowledgeable employees, but it looks like I am going to stick with that location from now on. Everyone thinks they are a technological expert these days. Know your stuff before stepping into these kind of places.

I love this place, when I need my midnight fix for something sweet I know I can run to Bosa for some doughnuts. Open 24 hours, you can eat inside and they have milk in a carton! That takes me back to my cafeteria days in school. They also offer tea, chocolate milk in a carton, soda, coffee ect. All kinds of doughnuts are offered but their smoothies are something to be desired. It was more like a milkshake in consistency and taste. Everything is made fresh at all hours of the day and they have a drive-thru in case you wanted to add insult to injury by not even getting out of your car to get your fat laden doughnuts.

So sad, Ren Faire is almost over. I swear walking up and down the walkways, I felt like a podling in The Dark Crystal during the podling dance scene. Think medieval instruments and people in period costumes, the smell of roasted turkey legs in the air, and a cold beer in your hand. They even have hot mead! I was almost tempted to rent a costume on my way in but I already had a cloak so I settled with what I had, but don't let your shyness stop you! In fact, you might feel like the odd one out if you decide to come dressed in your futuristic clothing.   Try the brownie sundae, it's to die for. So much to see and do but be sure not to miss the jousting tournament! Pick up a schedule on your way in. I don't think they do the discount with a period costume anymore, otherwise I would have shown up in a Star Trek uniform. Hey, it's a period right? I saw no one in stocks, but they did have tomato throwing.    I am a Renaissance woman. This is a Renaissance Faire. We are a perfect fit!

I totally signed myself up for a library card and got my library lending on. I love this library and the fact that you can waltz across the way and read your finding in the nice gazebo or on one of the stone walls outside underneath a tree. This is all located in one center with the senior center and post office block all within a couple of feet. There is a gift shop and cafe when you come in the entrance and an area to eat and use your laptop. They are always having classes here for something or another so check out the website and see if anything interests you.

*Friendly employees who will help take your purchases and hold them for you in the front. *Pittsburgh Willy's is on site *Outdoor selection makes this place even bigger *Awesome old print advertisements are only 6.95, good idea to frame and put up somewhere.  Some cons *Many items are overpriced but sometimes you can spot a good deal *Some of the selection is more 'recent' items  Just when you think you are done, there is more to look at this place is so big. There is a middle section filled with new purses that are not antiques and a beaderie.

Um, I'm not white but I still didn't like this place, at least not the ice cream. The lady at the counter was really nice and let us taste a few flavors to see which one we wanted which I hate to say were not very good. They each had a weird texture, kind of gummy and grainy like the ice cream was not smooth. It had a grainy appearance and tasted okay but like I said it was not the greatest.   They have several other things on their menu: nachos, banana splits, fresas eon crema, jugos naturales, shaved ice, aguas frescas, elotes, chamoyadas, raspado, duros, candies, paletas, etc.   You can't miss the place because it is painted in happy colors with sweets on the outside of the shop. When you walk in everything is pink and blue striped which I love since I love kawaii things and there is a strong smell of sugar in the air which I loved! I think I will give this place one more try before I pass completely.

You will love this greasy spoon as much as you love the diner look and feel to the place. Clean restaurant and it can get very busy at times, especially in the morning. This is a good place to come and read your paper and sip coffee.   I had a standard breakfast with over-easy eggs, potatoes and toast. Now come on, I know what your thinking, who can mess up eggs and toast? Your right but they get it right, perfectly looking and tasting how a greasy spoon breakfast should taste. Which is good but obviously not that great for your health. Who said I was trying to save your life?  My partner's breakfast with the bacon looked awesome. The bacon looked thick cut and perfectly cooked to perfection. He has also had the bacon cheeseburger which he observes is equally satisfying.

What a nice idea to sit and eat on their outdoor patio before you commence your shopping? I hate grocery shopping or any kind of shopping for that matter and it makes it that more enjoyable if you have something nice to look forward to. They usually have the Spanish radio stations here on the weekends so it makes for a truly enjoyable experience and you can pretend you are in Mexico.   Maybe they are dueling with the Ranch market that is across the street, who knows. The prices on food is pretty low compared to the regular supermarket. They now give you the prices of Fry's and how their prices compare for each items. I bought this huge seedless watermelon for $4! It looked like an alien pod. They will fry your fish for you if you ask. The manager stopped and asked us how we were doing. A pretty enjoyable shopping trip.

We only go here if absolutely, positively...necessary. My partner ordered the Mongolian beef last night and he said there was a lot of gristle in it. I don't know about you but that kind of turns my stomach. The spring rolls are fine and the lo-mein is passable. Just plan on taking your order out as the kids they have working the front are none too friendly. I went to the restroom and the bathroom had several small live and dead roaches in it. I had to make sure I got out of there as quickly as possible before one of them crawled on me! I don't know about you, but if a restaurant has a nasty bathroom, it says volumes about the kitchen. I do not want to come back here. Shame, considering they kind of make up their own hours and stay open sometimes until 2:30am.

A small indoor shopping district that also houses a cell phone shop, a bookstore, and a clothing shop. We sat down at the indoor restaurant and ordered carnitas which were pretty flavorful and sat down at one of the benches in the wide open area for seating. There is a big screen TV which everyone seemed to have been watching intently. We watched a couple of kids from the hair salon a few steps away wrestle over a ball. For some reason, in the back it also doubles as a daycare for children?  What I did find refreshing was the horchata and snow cone that I ordered. On the side of the restaurant there is an ice cream stand that serves fruit juices and snow cones of all flavors. Anyone that sells snow cones is okay in my book. There was also some small clothing stores inside but nothing that I would really go out of my way to return to again. It was strange because everything was so small inside.

Chandler liquors is easily the most claustrophobic liquor store I have ever been into. Their beer selection is not as extensive as BevMo but they have all of your usual suspects and then they do have a small selection of single imported beers (sorry no points guide here, you'll have to know what you want).  From the beer refrigerated cases, there is a wide assortment of junk food in which I was delighted to see tall cans of Dr. Pepper, hot pickles and an old time Dan Conner favorite:  Pork rinds.   Just about anything you need they probably have it in this place. Need a handgun? Check. Hunting Knife? Check. Need a spare key to be made? Check. They even have glass pipes, decorative lighters, sunglasses (even designer), OTC medicine, jewelry, brass knuckles, so yeaahh you could get into a lot of trouble at this place.  If you need wine they have it along with a nice selection of airplane shooters and it isn't just the cheap liquor either. The fine wines are in bins in the back to the right when you come in. If you need a imported or domestic keg this is your place and they have beer pong kits. You can get your money order or money gram done here along with your lottery tickets, cigarettes, fine cigars, and smoking accessories.   They also have a collection of adult magazines, movies (if you see in my photo they are running a special of buy 2 VHS get 2 free, but then again it's VHS so go figure), sex dolls, flesh-light type of toys, cyberskin ect.   They are open until 11pm Mon-Thu but thankfully until 1 am on the weekends. The store is run by the Indian owner who seems nice enough but is very reserved. Every time I come in here I am often reminded of the scene from The Simpsons when Homer goes into the convenience store to buy illegal fireworks:    Homer: [trying to casually buy illegal fireworks] Hi umm, let me have one of those porno magazines, large box of condoms, a bottle of Old Harper, a couple of those panty shields, and some illegal fireworks, and one of those disposable enemas... eh, make it two. Later... Marge seeing Homer's purchases: I don't know what you've got planned for tonight, Homer, but count me out.  I mean I don't know if they sell fireworks, I didn't ask but that would be the ONLY thing they did not have out of the list.

We were debating between coming here or going to our old favorite: Moreno's just down the street. Since we found Moreno's by ditching this place a year ago, we decided to try this place out for dinner just to see if we were missing anything. The end result was no, we weren't missing anything by skipping out on this place for so long. The outside looks really outdated and run down but sometimes you can't judge places by how they look on the outside.  The inside was pretty clean but also looked like a flashback to the 90's. There was no one in there when we went so we got to order right away, although there was no greeting and the cashier had a serious attitude problem. I was intrigued to see that they offer Indian fry bread but I went ahead and ordered the cheese enchiladas with a chile relleno, and my partner ordered the mini chimi's.   We waited not too long and the cashier clomped out with our food and left it in a huff on our table. If you eat there, the meals come in to go styrofoam containers and I began to wonder where the silverware was. When I opened up the container I saw that the forks were on top of the food inside, can you say gross? I don't like it when the top of my straw has been touched by the waiter. It reminded me of going to a buffet and finding the spoon has been dropped into the food.  Prices were low but they charged $1.50 for a side of guacamole and extra for sour cream for a dish (chimichangas) that should already come with it. Not a huge helping, one of those small condiment to go containers. The guac had more onions than avocados and the mini chimi's never specified what kind of meat was inside, so they were filled with some mystery mixture that appeared to be mostly beans with essence of beef. The taco meat appeared to be dry but on the plus side the rice was moist and I could smell the tomato sauce.   The chile relleno I ordered was spongy at best and the enchiladas were forgettable in flavor. The beans were very greasy but hey this isn't health food right?   I can't blame those Chandler High student for getting addicted to this place, teenagers don't know any better. Telling people the only way to get authentic Mexican food is to travel to Mexico or to get real ethnic food is to travel to that prospective country does not make any sense. You would have to tell all of the ethnic home cooks including my parents that in order to make "real" food they have to go back to their countries and cook it there. People who come from other countries if they do it right, are perfectly able to replicate the same meals in America. Restaurants can be authentic if they tried.   So while I wait for my dad to return from Cuba and Panama, and my mom to return from Spain with my meal, I will just say this place is not worth it. I recommend Moreno's if you are restricted to this area only or La Tolteca in Phoenix if you can travel.

Shades of the West has been around for a long time, since 1971 and has a bunch of southwest crazy crap that you can take back to your relatives. What? You actually thought I was going to write a review that was serious? From hats to kitchenware, gourmet spices to moccasins Shades has it all.   They also sell the popular Painted Ponies collection at their store and on their web store. They have chips and salsas, hot sauce, Ass Kickin' food products, prickly pear, glass, gift jewelry, hand-weaved baskets, cook books, live cactus and all sorts of southwestern knick knacks. Don't leave without your scorpion encased in a dome gift.

I really loved the Treasure Trove located right next door to this store but when we stepped into the Antique Center, I was kind digging the red hall entryway. It was different but after that the rest of the place resembled some kind of strange museum like another Yelper mentioned.   I saw James Brown here, his dancing toy likeness that is. If you are into the sort of thing, they have plenty of tools to buy here. When we wandered into the back we ran into this creepy mannequin re-enactment of the last supper featuring man sized mannequins under an eerie florescent light. A little unsettling and I swear I could feel their eyes following me as I passed by. I noticed a lot of tribal items here in this store.   That aside, as we went throughout the store everything had this dusty, attic type feel to it. Lots of taxidermic animals, some missing vital parts and some were very dusty. I kept finding weird mannequins throughout the store, I guess they were there to showcase the merchandise? There were no merchants there but we had a fellow come talk to us and the woman at the front was pretty friendly. We didn't leave with anything that day. I recommend Merchant Square instead.

This is truly one of the best antique stores you can find here in the area. Since I work in aviation, I appreciated the aviation collection in the store. Old airline memorabilia and they even had old drink stirrers! I like to collect old pilot jackets so I was thrilled with what they had.  I know this store is in Scottsdale and more expensive prices are expected, but I really didn't notice anything outrageous. If anything, the things that I wanted were reasonably priced and some old vintage purses that I was squealing over, were only under 15 bucks.   The store is kept very clean, organized, air conditioned, lit, and there is ample space to move around without feeling like you're going to knock everything over. If you are looking for jewelry you will be pleased with the large selection they have of really nice fashion jewelry.   I like a lot of old antique furniture, glassware, and kitchenware and I am very pleased whenever I come here. We found this old high backed wheelchair that we could set up in our house like something out of the movie The Changeling. (We have a themed house thing going on)

Two words: awesome and cheap. Eyeglasses are $30 but since my future mother-in-law needed progressives, they were $179+thinner lens+$20 anti glare coating=$270 total. I always order from online which is waaay cheaper (PM me if you need to know which stores), but if you need to know exactly what you will look like in your glasses, this is a cheap option. Online stores have you upload a photo but sometimes this is not always accurate if you don't pay attention to the measurements of the glasses.   The workers were super friendly, "Bill" gave us information but let us take our time and was not pushy, nosy, or an otherwise nuisance that some people can be at these optical places. They do not do exams, so just make sure to get an exam elsewhere for $40 bucks and bring it here (don't let anyone give you any guff about this either, they are required by law to provide you with your prescription). Don't worry about PD unless you are ordering online, they measure for that here. Many customers came and went and they knew many of them by name, a good sign. A good selection but I am too eccentric with my style, though I am excited to try and bring in any vintage designer glasses for lenses.

I would agree with what everyone else has said but to add more, I would say that this school is low on the list of community colleges you should think of attending. Heck, even South Mountain is better than this! The whole system is set up for failure before you can even start your classes. Like another reviewer said, it is very Mac unfriendly, heck it's any computer unfriendly. The teaching tools that they have are horrible (I took Geology this semester and the online lab looked like crap, I couldn't tell diorite from granite, lol, and yes you will get marked down for wrong answers because you couldn't make out what it was! grrr!), the videos are lame and very small so that you cannot tell what is really happening onscreen.   It's like these teachers just cut and paste their lesson plan, and the only actual work they put in is to grade papers. There are some great teachers I have come across but this is very few and rare. If anything confuses you, you had better hope you figure it out on your own because you can only contact the teacher through email and not by phone (I don't know about you, but I like to talk to a teacher in person or by phone when I have a problem, much more concise). I caught so many errors in one class that they put me in charge of going over lessons and proofreading them! I would get things wrong on tests that were not wrong and only after making a stink about it, would I get my grade changed. Nearly everyone who works there for customer service has an attitude or is extremely depressed. When you call in they usually rush you off of the phone as quickly as possible. I told them look, I'm quitting because you can't get it together and they said, "Well we can see you are an extremely good student and we would hate to see you leave." So, like a dummy I stayed the semester. Overall, I'm going back to Gateway. When things don't work out, it's best to start from whence you came.

Short wait but the ER has seen better days, at first glance you might be tempted to leave based on appearances. But hey, you're here for an emergency right?  It took two visits to the ER and what I can only imagine are astronomical hospital bills to find what should have been found the first time.

I like the concept of Pita Jungle, I have just had better. Way better. The service was pretty good and it is just off of the light rail. We sat near the back where the booths are coming apart. I know they are probably going for the whole retro, artsy type vibe but I am an artist myself and I would just call it dumpy. We ordered the hummus (of course) and pita, a falafel pita, Philadelphia cheese-steak pita, and the pesto pizza.   I was extremely disappointed by the pita when it came, a whole plate of hummus and they gave us this small, sad looking pita to go with it. For a place with pita in its moniker, you would think the pita would be the prize of the menu but it was chewy, flat and stiff. I sat there the whole time eating and thinking how much better Zorba's in Chandler is than this.  The hummus is okay and while the falafel was passable, they wrapped it in that so-so pita. The pesto pizza was good but nothing to write home about. The cheese-steak pita needed to be mopped up after but I hear it was good.   For $28 for these items I was left feeling like we would have had a better experience and WAY more food to show for the money at Haji-Baba's in Tempe on Apache Blvd. At least I got some free 944 magazines out of it but I was hungry again two hours later.

I love the vintageyness of this place. I like how everything is dark brown and they have those old booths like back from the 70's. The service is extremely friendly and quick and the food is pretty consistent and good. Just sit back and relax and let the good looking waitresses take care of you.

I am shocked and depressed that I only found out about this place weeks before they close. The people are super friendly, and they have a huge amount of costumes. The place is a little small, and when you come in you pick out the costumes you want from a computer screen. It's probably better to peruse their website first before you come in. Now you may say, after Halloween, why the need for costumes? Santa suits, Ren Faire, Christmas parties, Thanksgiving day party, Comic Cons, New Year's Day parties, dress like a big cherub for Valentine's Day for pete's sake the list can go on and on. Rock bottom prices, they are only open for the rest of this week. Get the word out!

Now I know I have this thing for Fascinations but this is one of the best stores I have been into. HUGE selection of porn. An incredibly large selection of dongs, toys, bathing suits, panties, night club wear, hosiery, lotions, oils, shoes, magazines, bondage, latex, whips, chains, and did I mention they are also a smoke shop?  They have plus sizes and their shoe selection goes up to a size 14 for you beautiful men and women out there. Seriously take your time and see what they have to offer, you will be like a kid in a candy store. I was excited to see that they have the Sybian but not to be left out they have the Venus 2000 for you guys.  They will also buy those old pornos you don't want.   Things are perhaps not too organized but that is the fun of the store. They do have some items on sale and if you buy 2 movies, you get the 3rd free! They are open late on the weekends until 1 am.

Ahh, Big Surf I owe you my childhood memories and my love of water slides. My favorite one is the big black one (that's what she said) where you don't know that the heck is going on or how far you have gone because everything is pitch black. You are not allowed to take any food inside but come on just hide a sandwich in your bathing suit and a corn dog in your trousers. Go on coupon days that can be found on their website.

In the heart of student-geared Tempe, lies Otto's Pizza & Pastry. A family operated and owned pizzeria since 1992. The french owner from Paris serves up New York style pizza with any toppings you can dream of. In between my favorite places, HTC Piercing and Cartel Coffee Lab. Tiny, intimate shop that has some of the most thinnest and crispiest pizza I have had in this city outside of Tucson.  My previous fav's have been Tessio's and Jaime's here in Tempe. Otto is now my new favorite. The counter girls are super cute and you can see Otto slaving away in the kitchen.   If you want something different than pizza, try the calzones, pastas, french sandwiches (Monte Cristo!), Italian sandwiches, or pizza rolls. The only qualm I have is that they are not open very late at all and they are closed on Sundays.

Love everything about this place. Where else can I get my henna and get amazing food at the same time? I love the Arabic coffee and it was great, although it is an acquired taste. I almost want to laugh at the people in Pita Jungle every time I pass by there to come here. Big, soft pitas with delicious hummus. The falafel is moist and fried perfectly. All of my weird artsy farsty friends have been telling me to come here for some time now and I have to admit they were right.   The jasmine rice is to die for, I had dreams about it later that night. The baklava comes in 7 different varieties and is always heavenly. On the other side there is a market and this place just screams home to me.

Sit on side if busy. Henna is of okay quality but I would not use it again on my hair, instead use the body quality henna on your hair. The Arabic coffee is a great treat before or after your meal, so thick and chocolatey.  I hate Pita Jungle and places like Haji's is why!  It can get kind of loud with people running their mouth and the place being so small with sounds bouncing off of the walls, but if you bring enough people with you to strong-arm a big enough table you are set to at least be comfortable.

I was actually pleasantly surprised coming into the store, they have a big selection of liquor. It looks so small on the outside I had just assumed it was just a little nondescript liquor store carrying all domestics. Not that there's anything wrong with that (read that in Seinfeld's voice). They were able to hold for me two cases of Ballast Point Victory at Sea and I was so grateful because that beer can be hard to come by. They also had weird muchie items like hot pockets, Jimmy Dean breakfast sandwiches sold individually, cheap burritos, frozen pizzas, ice cream, pickles, well you get the idea: drunk food. It is also a little market with the usual small convenience store items like food and home supply goods. The service was super friendly and respectful, I would definitely return.

New location literally across the street in a new building right across from Haji Baba's. They are still setting up inside so they do not have a huge selection, but everything was well organized. This place reminds me more of the old school thrift stores, and not the glossy Goodwills of today. If you are looking for genuine vintage finds to DIY or just to have in your home, this is the place to stop.  Customer service was almost absent though, but I suppose that will pick up once they start doing more business. There was literally no one in the store when I went, and I think only one or two people came in while I was there. They have plenty of craft items, porcelain dolls, and books. They have several isles of books.

Staff was friendly and it was busy, but they were definitely limited in their selection. I have never been to a Buffalo Exchange with such a little selection and what there was available was just meh, I've seen better. The clothes to pick from were very generic, there was nothing that screamed out to me high quality! or wow, what a cute outfit. I don't think I will be returning anytime soon, I was very disappointed.

At The Chuckbox, you are in the grill. You are a part of it, well at least that's what it feels like in the summertime coming here. I was reminded of an old tinder pile of wood, in case you were looking for the place and could not find it. I honestly do not know how they have managed to not go up in flames yet in all of the time they have been here. They have misters outside if you want to brave the desert heat and sit on the patio.  Why would I review a place that has over 100 reviews? because then you can read a recent review instead of one from 2009. I am a vegetarian so I don't know if my review is baloney or what, but I assure you my gardenburger was the bomb. Draft beer anyone? My partner is a meat eater/carnivore and he assured me his burger was seared perfectly on the outside and very juicy on the inside. I could not for the life of me get him to shut up about the damn burger. I tried talking about musicians, porn, firearms, all to no avail!   I really like the condiment station where you can do it yourself and pile on whatever it is that you pile on your burger. I feel like I walked into old west with hammered copper top tables and wooden crate seating. You can watch your burger being grilled and it is not frozen beef but fresh chuck. The fries were good and although I did not get the onion rings, they looked excellent on other people's plates. Just make sure you sit next to the air conditioner.

A small but quaint Target, I love that I can shop for everything that I need in a hurry without feeling like I need to cross the Sahara Desert to get the things I need. There is a Fry's Marketplace across the street, so you can get all of your shopping done in one trip!

TJ's is one of three stores that I frequent for my groceries because: cheap bananas. Well, really it is for cheap wine, bread, cheese, flowers, and I could go on and on. Service has always been really helpful but most importantly are the free samples! Bonus that it is right next to Trading Hands Bookstore. Google top wines from here and pick out some, most have been pretty good.

This by far has to be the best Filiberto's location. I have been to the Phoenix, Tempe, Chandler, Prescott, Mesa, Gilbert, Tucson and Casa Grande locations.   -Clean salsa bar with chunky and smooth salsa options. -Free chips, most places will charge you for a small order. -Gold Peak green tea! -Smoothies and juices -Video games, tv's and free wifi -Fruit filled churros   The tortillas are fresh and the place was actually clean, shocking. For what it is, this is a good location to stop by at if you are in the mood for this type of mexican food.

For a fast food place, they have very good fish tacos here. Try the fish burrito, I know it doesn't sound very good but trust me it is excellent. They have menus that tell you the nutritional value of every meal they make.

This place was a bit scary, the floors and shelves were dirty as were most of the furniture. Really worn, dirty cushions were 3.99 each and a dusty, old Schwinn exercise bike was 139.00. I get the feeling this location receives the cast-offs because I frequent the location in Chandler which has much nicer items than what I witnessed at this store.  The staff seemed to be more concerned with carrying on their excited conversation behind the counter than to help any of the customers. I like to frequent not for profit thrift stores like these, but they really need to step up their game to get people in the door.

We came to see the, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest play, and it was very intimate, welcoming, and comfortable. They set up so that you actually felt you were in a hospital. You also get a discount if you are a senior or student. The staff was very friendly, and they offer snacks and drinks. The actors had just the right amount of props, the costumes and acting were great. Kudos to the staff, and thank you for the wonderful night.

When I think wax museum, I think figures that may come alive at any second to grab you and drag you back into their netherworld of wax! Okay, not really but some of these figures are done so well, you just may think you saw one move out of the corner of your eye. Going off of tips that this museum as well as the Venetian are haunted, we came here to take a look. Well, the only spirits that we witnessed were the ones being poured out of a bottle from the bartender at the interior bar.   When you enter, you have the chance to have your photo taken with cheesy messages to home signs of your choosing. After Joan Rivers insults your outfit, you may enter the themed rooms. Many props are in place for photo ops. Still a great way to blow an hour in Las Vegas!

I only came here to gamble so I cannot comment on the rooms and such. However, that being said, the Circus Circus is one of the most depressing casinos I have ever been in. I don't understand what happened to it but this place needs help desperately. This goes without saying but we all know that casinos are very smoky, however, upon walking in the entrance I said, "My god, the smell." It smelled as though 20 years had gone by with no cleaning, filtration, or fresh air, and the smell of extremely stale smoke made it hard to breathe. Against my better judgement, I still proceeded to the casino and was amazed at how sad and run down everything looked. I cannot not recommend this hotel/casino to anyone to stay, let alone gamble.

Do not let the appearance of the casino deter you away, $5 steak and a pretty decent weiss with a slice of lemon await you. I honestly had no problems with the wait staff, he was very friendly and quick. Maybe it was because we were not falling over drunk and pissing all over the seat that had something to do with it (although I don't judge, it is Las Vegas after all). The salad had no whites, all green with a pretty decent Thousand Island dressing. Everything was cooked perfectly and tasted on point which was a surprise. Don't mix up the brewery with the restaurant, keep walking past until you hear people singing off-key!

This place has fresh scones, living room/community-style setting, and people on laptops doing their homework, or people chatting enjoying a good cup of coffee. The roast on the coffee was perfect, no wimpy coffee here.   The place can be a little intimidating when busy (which is mostly), between people passing wine and coffee at the community tables, to people lounging on the sofas. There seems to be a sense of community when you walk in. The employees were extremely friendly but when they get packed (think mornings), parking can be a little difficult to procure. However, there is plenty of street parking! The owner posts their fresh dinner menu daily on fb.

If you are the kind of person who likes pushing people out of the way to get to a shirt or if Black Friday is your Superbowl, then this is the store for you.  Generally depending on what time and day you go, it may or may not be insanely busy. For some reason I always show up when there are not so many people. You can find some good deals here if you look but the merchandise if always changing and that is not always the case. The shoe section is what grosses me out half of the time I go here because at least at a thrift store they throw out shoes that are extensively worn, smelly and stained. Here they will sell them to you in the name of it being a high end brand. I saw these tennis shoes that were worn with mud and I thought that someone had taken off their shoes and left them there and shoplifted some other ones, but they were selling them!  I usually do not like shopping because I do not like people to get too close to me and I do not like children suddenly darting in front of me or scaring me by popping their face out of a clothing rack. To say it ineloquently, people will be all up in your grill here. Seriously there is chaos at this store to be had. Be sure not to trip down those stairs.

If you like dust and records, this is the place for you. If you are looking for something out of the ordinary or hard to find, they probably might have it at Eastside Records.

Always a great time to be had at the Venetian. The rooms have a sunken living room, 3  flat screens (1 of them in the bathroom), a jet tub, amazing views, and a most luxurious bed. So luxurious, we are considering ordering one for the house. The room service was very quick and friendly with any request that we had.   The room safe came quite in handy as I had brought some very expensive jewels in anticipation for the Mark Twain show at UNLV. Not to be missed are the walks around the casino (the architecture is amazing), and the gondola ride (make reservations).

I really loved the atmosphere stepping into this place. I have been learning German and what better way to brush up on my singing skills than visiting a German restaurant hall? The service was good but the real take home of the night was the Hefeweizen which was great. The potato soup, pretzels, and brats were tasty although the pretzels were a bit on the salty side for my taste. I was really looking forward to enjoying a loud atmosphere with singing and this place did not disappoint!

Lee's Sandwiches is a great Vietnamese sandwich shop. I love the mint milk, it is so refreshing. It is perfect after a meal or anytime and they give you a big size. Of course you can get it boba or they have a wide selection of other teas and drinks:  Taro, Honeydew, Soy Bean, carrot, strawberry and passion fruit drinks! Italian sodas, mint jelly, watermelon, sugar cane, iced lattes.   Any and all smoothies:  banana, apple, avocado (yes, avocado), cranberry, durian (mmm yes, you read that right), carrot, durian-green bean, green bean, jack fruit, lychee ect. too many to list.   They make their own bread on site and the ingredients are always fresh and quality. I am a vegetarian and there are a few options as far as sandwiches go:    Vegetarian-Fried tofu, vermicelli, bean curd, yam, carrot, house pickle, jalapeno, cilantro, salt & pepper and soy sauce. Very good if you like fried tofu like me!  California avocado-Avocado, double cheese, lettuce, tomato, mustard.  Don't forget, you can always ask them to add to any sandwich to make it custom! They have pork and shrimp egg rolls, coconut waffles, croissants and pastries.

This is hands down, my absolute favorite place to haunt when I am in Las Vegas. I know, "you go to LV to play pinball?!?" The answer is yes, yes I do. It is every pinball junkies dream to find a dimly lit, air conditioned hall, with all types of vintage and modern pinball machines. Most of the machines play for a quarter and if you need help with lost change they are very friendly in the back.   Not everything is pinball, they have some arcade and racing games. They even have a Whack A Croc game in the back.   Pros Pinball housed in 10,000 square feet! 1950's to 1990's pinball machines 60's, 70's, and 80's pinball machines are prevalent Popcorn from the vending machine for 50 cents Yoo-hoo and other treats are available for sale Non-profit, all excess proceeds go to charity. Imagine, gaming benefiting charity!   Cons None, other than the Pinball Hall of Fame being too far away for most of us  Just go, take the kids. I wasn't around for most of pinball history but that doesn't mean I don't appreciate and love it! See the website for their pinball game list and complete history.

Very nice place to hangout, I came here to pick up a very special reserved bourbon and I was able to get it at a decent price. I only recently started learning more about cigars, and I only smoke once a year (for my birthday), but they seemed to have an extensive and quality selection. I can't wait to make it back here for a drink!

The top level is the best level in my opinion. It's the quietest level and you get a good view of downtown Phoenix from both the North and South side ceiling to floor windows. The only real drawback is the smell that comes from the DVD and CD section, I don't know it it's urine or just the plastic casings that are giving off that smell?  The cafe is closed indefinitely as I was informed by the librarian with no real date of when they are going to be opening it back up again. I have never had any problems with any of the homeless people that come to the library, but you might get asked for some change in the parking lot or asked to sign a petition by the entrances. The 2nd level is for studying and they have a 'quiet' room where you are expected to keep your mouth shut and study.  Why budget cuts!? The libs is only open until 5pm on Monday and a couple of other days. Overall, the library is huge and has everything you may be looking for. I want to get locked up like that dude Powder and read everything this library has to offer.

One of the most aggravating restaurants I have been to in awhile. My partner and I were so irritated that we both got into an argument we were so irritated.  First arrive and there is a woman sitting behind the front counter and she does not greet us right away so we are standing there awkwardly not sure of what to do, my partner asks, "are we supposed to sit ourselves?" to me. Then she finally greeted us and we were whisked away to a huge table for only the two of us. All of the colors are bright in here which didn't bother me the same way they seem to bother everyone else.  We were given a very short menu with half in Chinese but then after awhile I see another couple with a very extensive menu and I am left wondering wth? I checked online before I went and saw that they had vegetarian options which I did not see on this extremely short menu. The other couple was white and we are not so it was not like they got the better all Chinese menu because they were Asian or something. When the owner comes to the table we request the other menu which he was happy to oblige. There were so many options you could get lost in that menu but I liked it.  We ordered a half duck, and vegetables in oyster sauce with jasmine tea. The duck came for some reason 10 minutes before my meal did so we both had to sit there waiting for my food because my partner did not want to eat without me. No Jasmine tea had come by that time 25 minutes after ordering. The duck was greasy and cold as my partner described it; it was like if someone had cooked it earlier in the day and left it out, room temperature and old tasting. When they finally came with my meal I found that the 'vegetables' was really only bok choy in some oyster sauce, I was very unhappy and the bok choy they gave me was mostly stems. We had to remind the original waiter to bring our tea and we ordered some spring rolls at that time.  The tea finally came and my partner asked for a spoon for the rice and that took 5 minutes to bring that, I even think that was yet another waiter who came to the table. My partner asked if they could warm up the duck which they did. Service was sooo slow even though there were many workers. The spring rolls we ordered never came so in disgust we just had our meals boxed and walked up to the counter to pay rather than wait 20 minutes to pay a check at the table. We will get our roasted duck from Lee Lee's from now on.

Very good authentic Mexican restaurant to eat at. The two main guys working here are very friendly and they go out of their way to make you feel at home and welcomed. I had the bean and cheese burrito which included fresh, homemade beans and delicious cheese. My boyfriend got the carne asada burrito which was piled high and to the brim of the tortilla.  The atmosphere is small but clean, I had passed by this place many times on my way to Paradise Video and I had always wondered if this place was any good. While we were eating even a worker from Taco Bell from across the way came in and ate! A very nice family owns this small shop but damn with all the hype about the daughters, I was expecting a crossbreed between Salma Hayek and Eva Longoria. Calm down people, very pretty girl but damn she's not that hot. Let's concentrate on that delicious enchilada sauce.

Tons of cheap items, if you need to get one specific thing ask someone where it is so you can avoid the tons of items you will invariably pick up while you aimlessly wander throughout the store looking for said specific item.   The clearance section/AS IS is on the ground floor past the registers. It's where you will find the floor model items, returns, damaged, and repackaged items. If you are lucky, you will find the exact same model you were looking at upstairs or online, only it has already been assembled for you! Bonus if there is no damage. They do not hold items for you and this is probably a good option if you have the means to take home already assembled furniture/items.  Grab a map, paper tape measure, pencil, and a catalog if you need them, these will come in handy. Sign up to be a member of Ikea Family, usually they have special sales, you get free coffee, extra Sm√•land time, and scan your IKEA FAMILY card at any kiosk or register in-store for a chance to win their monthly drawing for $100!  Check the website for daily specials on the day you go. You can also make and print a shopping list online. Although you could view it on your smartphone, service might be spotty so it may be better to print it out. Wear comfy shoes, you will be here awhile. If all else fails, flop down at the Ikea cafe with a chocolate overload cake, or as I call it, "chocolate overLORD" cake lol. It will rule you. Leave it to IKEA to make us want to eat at a furniture store.   If you are on a budget but have champagne tastes, check out IKEA hacks (google) where you can turn those particle board furnishings into customized pieces for little or no money. Paging all of the DIYers.   Enjoy yourself, take a nap on a couch. If people give you a weird look, pretend you are modeling the couch and give a flamboyant gesture Vanna White style. Pretend to have your own cooking show in the kitchen showroom section. Grab your girl and lay down the slick arm trick in one of the living room showrooms.   And finally for the love of all that is holy, remember to bring your own bags! If you have never been, Ikea does not bag anything so you can either buy those great, indestructible Ikea blue bags which double for a laundry bag, grocery bag, everything bag basically. However if you forget them, you will end up with a surplus collection quickly. Just leave some in the car. Yeah.

I was very surprised at the selection and prices of items in the store. My boyfriend's dad turned me onto this place. He gave me a gift set of spices for Christmas and I was hooked, the freshness and flavor is something that cannot be matched with supermarket spices. Then when I ran out, I debated buying more for myself. He is pretty wealthy and I am super cheapie, so I thought everything would be expensive. I noticed they have two locations close to me, one in Paradise Valley, and the other at Tempe Marketplace. Their prices are actually the same as spices you would find in the supermarket. But that is where the similarity ends, the difference in taste is worlds apart. They have all the regular spices, and then they have many of their own proprietary spices. Each spice has a label that tells you about the spice and what you can use it for. They sell chili packets so it's super easy to make chili. They also sell empty bottles so you can mix your own spices (or just save the bottles like I do).   They has something called Frozen Pizza seasoning that you add to your frozen pizzas. They sell 1/4 cup, 1/2 cup, 4 oz., 8oz., and 1 lb bags of seasonings. A 1 lb bag of garlic will set you back $13.10. You get a catalog filled with their spices and recipes when you checkout. I plan on purchasing the Natural High Fat Cocoa powder and making some of the best brownies I have ever had.

This bookstore is more like a cross between bookstore and metaphysical store. There are always a ton of events, the night we went there last they were having a author discussion and signing. So many kooky things, toys, wind chimes, incense, Alex Grey  calendars, tarot decks, cooking supplies and they regularly have sales on their used books. There are also book clubs, children's reading, and as an added bonus; Wildflower Bread Co. is next door.   They have a program called Before It's Trendy for kids ages 12-17 that allows readers to apply to join and read books long before they are published. You get advance copies of books and write reviews on them, if your review is selected you get trade credit!

There's not much to say that hasn't already been said, but when you have over 1K reviews and almost 5 stars, you know everyone is onto something. I had a standard pasty and it was so tender, flavorful, and just short of jumping for joy while eating it. The meat tasted like it was slow cooked for hours, the potatoes were soft but not soggy, and very well seasoned. The serving is also huge so if you have a big appetite, this will fill it. No sharing!! So far I've only gotten the pasty down, but I can't wait to try more off the menu.

I discovered In-N-Out Burger in Tucson, so when I passed by the location in Chandler, I didn't pass up the opportunity to chow down. It was pretty busy inside so we were expecting a wait time similar to the one in Tucson. We placed an order and were told it would be about 15 minutes. The order was for 1 double, 2 singles, fries, and a Neapolitan shake. The order came out fast but the place was still hopping so we ate in the car, turned on an episode of Martin and we were in business. The burgers were so juicy with just the right amount of fat, everything tasted fresh on a toasted bun. The fries were not an afterthought, and were crisp with enough salt. The shake..the shake is what gets me every time, so velvety smooth, soft, and creamy. True to its ice cream counterpart, the shake was sectioned off to each of the flavors: chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry. If you drink from the middle, you get all of the flavors in one! Yum. I don't think it's the best burger you could ever have in your whole life, but it's consistent, fresh, and mighty tasty.

Very professional and clean. Marilyn and Andy are super cool and even if you have a dumb question, they don't look at you with that duh look on their face. I have been here so many untold times but every time I go, I feel like I'm at home because everyone is so laid back but not lazy and stupid laid back. My partner had misjudged his piercing placement and when we went back we were prepared and knew that we were going to pay for another piercing (duh, they ask you if it looks good) but Andy ended up not charging us.  You definitely don't want to go cheap with your body, so leave those other discount, 2 for 1 body piercing places and go to HTC to get it done right.

Party America is back open again and they have been having this 'Clearance/Store Closing' sign up in their window for awhile but each time we would try to go they were closed. So apparently they close early, come earlier.   We finally were able to make it, but most of the store was taped off. A few aisles with mundane stuff we weren't interested in were on clearance so that was a bust. They were starting to put out more Halloween items so I guess they are going out of business but staying in business until after the Halloween season. Hopefully I can go back when they have put more stuff out.

A hidden away Farmer's market, drive too fast and you may miss it. I came here because I saw it on the Food Network with Bobby Flay and I thought I would stop in. The counter lady was very friendly and the store was small with an outside chili roaster. I am not sure if they were cleared out for Thanksgiving or if supplies had not come in yet because they were on the low side. However, the golden apples I purchased were delicious, I ate 5 of them that night! I love that I can come here for local honey.

We visited after the holiday rush and they still seemed to be busy so we waited 15 minutes. No problem, we had a few drinks at the bar and took in the ambiance. We were served herbed olive oil and bread with our wine which was a nice touch. Prices are pretty reasonable and you receive a lot of food. For $20 I got the lobster ravioli and it was delicious. The pasta was fresh, the ravioli were satisfactorily stuffed, and the cream sauce was tomatoey.   The service was excellent, I really hate it when waiters hover. For what it is, Nick's is decent Italian fare. You won't exclaim, "OMG, I am back in Italy!!" while you are eating but it's fresh, it's tasty, and the variety and servings are great.

A cancer free celebration dinner!  Awesome possum this buffet was. So many options to choose from and for my fellow dinner guests, steak for dinner! Following the suggestions from Randy, I stopped by this place and boy was I glad that I did. I always though buffets were forever lame, but now I see the buffet light at the end of the tunnel.   Plenty of vegetarian options like meatless mexican options, lo mein, spring rolls, macaroni and cheese, salad bar etc. I did not leave hungry. They have a chocolate fountain so that means chocolate covered strawberries!! Yes! or chocolate covered macaroons! mmmm  The service is always great but the bathroom was a bit dirty the last time I went. After I complained they did give me a nice phone call so I say great customer service. 4 stars~

I bought my sister's birthday cake here that was big enough to feed 70 people and let me tell you, they know how to do cakes. Everyone raved. I hate butter cream and overtly sweet frosting, so I was pleasantly surprised when they used whipped cream frosting without me having to request it. If you hate the grocery store cakes with their godawful bone dry cakes and disgusting frosting you should give El Rancho Market a try. They have a great cake book you can order out of.   Don't be intimidated like most people who do not speak Spanish. I don't have that problem but my boyfriend is a gringo and he has no problem shopping here. They have even joked with me sometimes that I need to teach him. Hey, he took Spanish in high school, he should get along fine right? If you come along and eat inside in the food court there are benches inside and they make their tortillas fresh so you can sit and eat and watch them make tortillas.

Super clean, this is a favorite for sure. I like to come in the evenings when there is not so many people. This is really like a department store in appearance. I've already gotten to know the many people that work here and they are very friendly. It is a Mormon run organization, so not sure if that has something to do with it. Not the greatest selection on furniture but plenty to be found in clothing and housewares!

We had an appointment at another Honda repairman to get our A/C fixed but I decided to call around and we ended up at the ol' Hon-Man. I saw signs for dogs and a doggie door and observed that they are very doggie friendly. The office is small inside but they have a very comfy office to hold you over while you wait: computer station with free wifi, television, water, up to date magazines that you actually want to read, plush leather chairs, and a nice fish tank. He even has a bearded dragon!  It turned out to be the lesser of two evils that went wrong with our a/c but the price was still way cheaper to fix than Gene's, Whitey's (who tried to up-sell us), and Hontech. It was only $180 and it took only 45 minutes! He was even willing to work with us on a part if it happened to be the more expensive repair that was needed. I am very excited to have found a new, reliable mechanic. Bring on the 115 degree summer baby...

Self scanning place is in system, just grab a hand held scanner and go about your shopping scanning things as you put them in your cart. At the end, you just go to the self checkout and pay! How easy is that.   Most of us already know what to expect from a Costco but here are a few things I enjoy whenever I go shopping:  *extra large rotisserie cooked chickens for $5, very cheap dinner *Life size teddy bears for $30! *Free samples! Come in the afternoon for these *Jumbo quantity size vitamins, their quality is excellent  *Movie tickets 2 for $16, save a few bucks *30 bottles of water for $3.50, remember to recycle! *Their cakes and bakery is awesome *Their snack bar is so good. Honestly their pizza is better than some of these restaurants on Yelp that specialize in pizza. Ridiculously x-large for only $10 and the very berry smoothie is really good as well as the berry sundae.

Can you say Thrifty pistachio ice cream on a sugar waffle cone? Yes! I believe they have about 20 or so different flavors, italian sodas, coffee, snack items, smoothies, Hawaiian shaved ice, and of course water.

Everyone has been pretty friendly every time we have come here. They offer the use of their tools if you need to tighten something up. They also offer free battery testing which is what we needed when we stopped by here. Overall, I am pretty satisfied with the service we have received here.

Great place to heal old childhood trauma and get that Cabbage Patch doll you never got as a kid.   I love you Bookman's. If you consider a bookstore to be your saving salvation then you will love it here. When you walk in it usually smells like bacon or panini's or whatever the heck they are cooking up in the cafe. You can sit in the cafe area and get a lemon bar but they also have many other baked goods and sandwiches to choose from.  They have old records and a bunch of old crazy crap in the back that you will love. The kids section has a cute little entry way just for kids and they sell toys, puzzles and games. They also have old vintage action figures from movies and shows. Pretty much any book you could be looking for they probably have which is all categorized so it is easy to find. If you cannot find it though they will be happy to help you in your quest.   They have a manga section and located just off of the cafe section, they have magazines and comics! I found old Creep comics that were $5 that are really worth $15. They have a porno collection in an armoire but everyone can see you look into it so most guys look awkwardly into it for a minute before walking away.   Books are reasonably priced and the price can be found penciled in the book on the first page on the upper right hand corner. They have a gaming section where you can buy games and old gaming systems like the original Nintendo. Make sure you make time to look near the registers, that is where they have the really interesting stuff.

Cafe Roma just went downhill since it has been in the Arizona Center for the last decade. They have whole pizzas ready and when you order a slice they reheat it in the oven for you, not a bad idea but then I saw a fly crawling on the pizzas right in front of me so I chose not to get a pizza. I chose the ziti which was okay the cheese didn't really taste like anything and the sauce was just weird. It came with a salad which was laughable because it was literally just two small pinches of salad with an overdose of dressing. I don't think I will be back here again after having been a long time customer.

Terrible sauce, canned enchilada sauce and a serious lack of flavor about sums it up.  I always drink the salsa from a Mexican food place to judge what kind of flavoring they have going on but I assume this was something that came out of a jar or can? My enchiladas came with the cheese inside completely cold and was not melted at all.   *Cheap prices *Convenient location *Gets very crowded and loud with little area to sit down  If you can make it, Moreno's in Chandler is one of the best as well as La Tolteca in downtown Phoenix.

Crap cable service, go with Dish you will be way better off. Customer service is horrible, you have to keep calling back until you get someone who knows what they are talking about. Believe me, I do this because many of the representatives were not technically savvy when they were hired. Something is always going out and prices are too dang high.

I absolutely detest this Costco. Like many of the reviews state, this Costco has a reputation for rude and lazy employees. Of course there are a few helpful employees but the card check clerks are rude.  I am surprised because I have never experienced such poor service at a Costco before. It may be my imagination but this location seems smaller and exceedingly more crowded than most locations. I miss Chandler Costco where they have the U Scan checkout. I usually drive out of my way to Chandler or Gilbert Costco. Beware of the lunch rush aka free samples in the afternoon.

Their pizza is still pretty good after all of these years. I remember when we used to go swimming when I was a kid and then right after we would go for pizza at Peter Piper. Well I won't bore you with my whole life story but just to say that a fond childhood memory still holds true as an adult. Not like I though it was good as a child and then as an adult it tastes like crap, it's not like that here. Never go on the weekends unless you like crowds and screaming maniacal children. In this location there is an ice cream shop and a pet store, sounds to me like a recipe for success; pizza, ice cream and puppies?

I must say I felt a little out of place as we were not greeted or spoken to for several minutes when we came in despite there being only one other person waiting for their drink. I liked their menu as they seemed to have ingredients and drinks that other places do not make. Specifically, we were looking for cranberry smoothies to cleanse our livers and everyone we called had no such thing.  Located right next to Sam's Club off of the 202 on AZ Ave, it is pretty convenient for those here in the East Valley. Once our order was taken, we then added a few free vitamin additives. Once the smoothies were made (we ordered large sizes and they were huge), the owner then started to open up and was more conversational. I felt better about the service and I am more than likely to return. They offer a frequent customer card so I guess I have my excuse!

I actually really like this location because it is never busy AT ALL. I like that I can find items that Fry's does not carry. Things like fresh wheatgrass, and a wide variety of vegetarian items. They also got a new Starbucks in their location, and they have a hot wing bar. Did you know the most ordered take-out item in America is chicken wings?? Think about it..

ALWAYS tons of friendly service whenever I walk into this location. You can become a Pro member for 14.99 which saves you money over time if you are a big user. Are you a big user? They have some selections for as cheap as $1 and they are pretty willing to look anything up for me even when I have come in there with some weird requests.

I was turned on (hey now) by the large designer selection and fair prices that this store had. I only picked up a crocodile briefcase $7, and I saw many more handbags under a $20 price range. Furniture, ehh not so much but they did have a nice selection of artwork, cushions, and housewares. The only real con here I can find is that clothing seems to not be labeled according to size, so it may take you several seconds to figure out where your size is located.   I cannot comment on the selling experience only that I watched other people doing it and it seemed like a painless process, credit for more clothes or cash! Items were kept very clean and there was no gross musty smell typically associated with such places.   Customer service is amaaazing, they have a super friendly woman manning the counter who will take the time to answer your questions, chat, and had true patience while showing me many items in the case (trust me that is not easy, I take forever to decide). My only regret is not picking up the Louboutins for $29 on my way out!

The service is very friendly at this location. It took a couple of employees to find what I needed but they found it, and he took several minutes to make sure we had what we needed. I noticed they don't seem to have very many employees working here, which is why most of the time I prefer to go to Lowe's. They usually have people falling all over you to help you.  The Christmas tree selection is nothing to sneeze at, I prefer to buy from a farm and support a local small business. However, we bought several Rosemary trees in the shape of a Christmas tree for $20 each. They smell amazing! As a bonus, you can snip off a twig and use it in your cooking.

We managed to get ourselves locked out of an interior door in our house, and we called this place of course, based on the reviews. He quickly gave us a call back from our message and gave us a reasonable price which was way cheaper than some other places we called before him. I don't anticipate needing a locksmith again (fingers crossed), but if I do, I will definitely be giving him a call again.

I am so a fan of this place, pretty good and consistent. Although I don't think my partner really liked his french toast with caramel topping, it was too sweet. Omelettes are the bomb, big and fluffy filled with whatever the hell you want. There are always running some sort of themed food and that's what I like about this place. I liked it when they had those minion drinks from Despicable Me.

The basics:  Wait time, what wait time? They literally came and called me back right on the minute of my appointment.  Reception is very nice and welcoming.  The facility is very nice and updated. Everything seemed very clean.   They seem to offer convenient appointment times, no waiting several months to see someone.   I was a little wary of seeing a PA, but I was extremely pleasantly surprised when she turned out to be excellent. The entire staff was very friendly. Staff passing by the nurses station where I was waiting for my scripts, smiled at me which was a very welcoming feeling. I somehow feel as though most medical office staff must have taken a course in grumpiness, when they should be polite.   The PA took her time to talk not only about my issues, but about the holidays that were coming up. The nurses and the technician who came into the room to give me a shot, all asked me what my plans were for the holidays. I had every single issue taken care of on my visit. I am thrilled I finally found a great doc!

A Ross store like any other but better.  -Clean -Organized, everything's not thrown everywhere -Slightly more selection than I have noticed from other Ross' in the area  I picked up satin pillowcases for $3, LA Colors and Sally Hansen nail polish kits for 5.99, men's dress shirts under $16, gourmet carousel of teas for 3.99, olive oils for $3. You can pick up some really nice purses for $40.  I know this is more specific but while browsing I saw a lot of Buddhist statues, mirror boxes with the statue on it etc, all good things for your altar if you're a Buddhist that you would end up paying an arm and a leg for at a spiritual or specialty shop. They had 15' figures for $8 and the mirror boxes were only $10! You would spend $80 elsewhere. This location does not have a very large food selection like some of the other stores, but it makes up for it in other ways.

The surgery department is great, I came in here yesterday for a surgery and everything was very easy to find and the check-in staff was very friendly. The check-in time to being called back was only about 20 minutes. They offer free wi-fi as well. The nurses were very kind and walked me through each step of what they were doing. I was very surprised to come in at 12 noon and be out completely after 5:50 pm! Everything went well, and they took care of me. I thought it was going to take all day because I think we all know hospitals are notorious for agonizing wait times to discharge you. Usually whenever I have gone into the ER, it has taken me 6-8 hours to get out. Seriously. Also, a big plus was to the nice facilities.

Get the card, if you go here enough like I do then you will save a lot of money. If you only go a few times a year then it's probably not worth it. Although it's only $5 to sign up and it's good for a whole year.

Wide array of herbs and ointments. To see the doctor, it is $10 then anything he prescribes is extra. Tell the lady at the counter what ails you and then she will ask some questions and tell you to wait in the seating area for the doctor. There are plenty of prepackaged teas and herbs. The service was friendly enough and is a good idea if you like to pursue other Eastern medicine solutions.

Awesomeness. I will never cut my hair and when I do cut it for split ends, I cut it myself. That said we brought my fianc√©s mother here the other day to get her hair cut. She has a hard time combing her hair so we wanted to go with a more shorter look for her. The girl patiently combed through her tangles and cut her hair very similar to the photo she picked out in their "idea" book.   Seniors get a discount so the cost was: $11 haircut+3 for a shampooing+tip. The Baseline South Phoenix location only charges $10 but they are really busy most of the time so we came here. The stylist even offered to cut her hair shorter for free if she wished to return in a few days if she was not happy with the length. Overall great place to get a quick cut or a cheapie massaging shampoo for $3. Who doesn't love cheap? You?

Zorba's has become our date place although it may seem like an unlikely place with it being within the vicinity of a .99 store, a furniture store, and Big Lots. It is quite dark inside and there is only waiter which is the owner, so service can sometimes be slow but she is a very nice lady so I forgive :) Don't expect to waltz on in here and be out in 30 minutes.   I am a vegetarian so there are plenty of options here for me from the hummus, falafel, ziti, manicotti ect. The falafel is quite good I just wished they gave you more of it. Any of their other dishes like the manicotti is quite good. Everything is home made and you can taste the difference. There is a bar on the other side of the restaurant so maybe if you prefer to eat at the bar you can.   My boyfriend always comments that the lamb shank is very tender and well seasoned and cooked. His lemon roasted potatoes were to die for, I tried them and then I went home and recreated the same thing I love it so much. It also comes with rice which was cooked perfectly and seasoned well. At the end of the meal we usually have baklava which is a piece of heaven after a satisfactorily meal.

This place is the real deal. Caprese salad, garlic bread, spaghetti and meatballs, salad, and veal parmigiana were all authentic and homemade in flavor. Nothing was too rich or greasy in flavor. It may look like a simple, plain eatery, but it has a very warm feel to it and you can also eat outside. We ordered so much we had leftovers, but that was the least of our worries because I looked forward to eating those delicious leftovers later.  I like to eat on the Strip for convenience but don't be afraid to venture out a little bit to this place. The espresso was excellent, I must recommend!

Every time I am in Las Vegas we make a stop here because, hello, zombies. They have a little bit of everything here and there relating to zombies and the horror genre. T-shirts, used and new dvd's, framed artwork, posters, figures, and more valuable memorabilia in the glass case.  Of course they have tons of The Walking Dead stuff, but also other major franchises and gaming items. The prices are pretty reasonable but my only gripe is that I wish they would use the space to add more stuff.

It was like Studio Ghibli, Hello Kitty, anime, and kawaii awesomeness all rolled into one! Taking a breather off of the strip, I ventured in here to see if I could score some pocky and hopefully some Ghibli items. Boy, did they not disappoint! Once you step inside you can see the place is packed to the gills with goodies, albeit a bit small in space. I am not too fluent on my Japanese yet so I was grateful that they had some signs up briefly describing that some of the items were.   Basically they have all of the foodie favorites in here from Japan: Meiji, puffy corn cheese curls, milk chocolate, chocolate crunchies, rice crackers, ramune candy, fizzy drinks etc. Fun bento supplies too. They have cell phone accessories, dvd sets, kitchen supplies, skin care (Hado Labo and the like), hair color, makeup, posters, and basically tons more which I will forget to mention here. I purchased tons of the very best sunscreen and a few Totoro posters. A must stop if you love this stuff!!!

I have been here on a few occasions and I was pleased with the selection pricing and customer service, but sadly that seems to have gone away. Items were on par with Flo's as another reviewer commented and for the selection I have been seeing, this does not quite match up. I was not greeted by the three ladies at the counter but was rather glared at, there was no hello or smiles, just a pack of elderly women standing in formation looking me right in the eye as I stroll in. Wow, welcoming right?   The more hidden gem seems to be in the warehouse where items are marked down significantly. There is less furniture in this area than in the store however. Televisions, clothing, and random items seem to be the majority in the warehouse.  There are some cool vintage finds to be found but after being treated like a leper and leaving aggravated I would rather stick to other mom and pop thrift stores and the better Goodwill locations in the valley. I don't understand why they would act this way when you want to make visitors feel welcome so they can spend money for a worthy cause. I was completely turned off and I won't be returning. This is not the only worthy cause in the world. 1 star for crappy service and visit the Goodwill on Pima in Scottsdale if you have the time and gas.

For some reason, every time I come here I always think of those stabbings that took place here in '08. The mall itself has a really outdated look on the outside as well as the inside. I remember when this used to be the mall that everyone would come to. They have the same stores that most malls do, it's just a worn down dumpy atmosphere. I see a recovery in order..

I didn't buy any glasses here but instead came for a free eyeglass adjustment. I bought some eyeglasses online (the drawback is that you can't get them adjusted if you buy online) and they fit really tightly around my head. I called other places and they wanted to charge me $10 but not here. Everyone was super nice too, might consider them in the future for eyeglasses since they seem to have good deals on 2 pairs.

I absolutely love this little Middle Eastern eatery. The service is great and the atmosphere is casual and intimate. God, you have to try the lentil soup, yes it is as good as everyone has been exclaiming. I will order that every time I go there. I always order falafel (vegetarian $9.95, fava and garbanzo beans deep-fried patties served with hummus, tabouli and pita bread) and it was awesome. My partner ordered the lamb roast ($14.95 tender chunks of boneless lamb in seasoned gravy over rice and topped with toasted almonds.)   Everything was very flavorful and fresh. It is a bit of a shame that this place is kind of hidden with no real exposure. Great for vegetarians and meat eaters alike.

Biggest selection of leather wear I have ever seen in my life. Nice selection of whips and S&M gear, if I was into such a thing. (cough, I'll take the whip). Boot selection is right in the front when you come in and they had a pretty good selection of platforms. I like that they integrated more stuff for women and they have dresses, skirts and shirts now. Watches with studs, jewelry and collars too.   Heading towards the back that is where you come to the good stuff. Dildos abound in every size, shape, color, function that you can imagine. Plenty of sex toys to keep you entertained for hours. Leave the kids at home as this store is strictly NOT for kids. Service is very friendly and they will help you try on those boots.

I have been going to this place for over 20 years now and it is the ideal greasy, cheesy and sinful cheeseburger and fries. The burgers are great and that goes with saying I don't eat meat anymore but I remember what they used to taste like. Fortunately, I can eat lots of other items that they have. The shakes are thick and fruity. I appreciate fries that are greasy but crisp, and in a brown paper bag and that's what you will get from Lucky Boy.   Lucky Boy not to be confused with the famous Big Boy burger shop (although you cannot miss the shop, there is a gigantic Big Boy-esque sign in red on top of the restaurant). It's not in the best area but neither are you going to see bullets come flying at you, come on some people have no clue what the ghetto really is.

Awesome employees, they carry the Oxbow brand if you have guinea pigs. This is an excellent brand of food and hay that they also carry in veterinarians offices. I went all over to specialty stores looking for oat hay, dealing with cliquey stores that had no idea what I was talking about. I come to PetSmart and they have it. I needed this specifically for a sick piggy that needed low calcium fiber.

Iced coffee of the day heaven!! I am so excited, I can't stand it! Okay maybe not that excited, but you would be too if you had gone to 8 different places, and they all had terrible coffee. Why do so many places think that an iced coffee equates to melted ice cream in a cup, with a ton of sugar, and no coffee flavor? Anyway, I didn't experience any of the snobby behavior so many have commented on. In fact everyone was very helpful and friendly. I can't wait to come back and try more coffee!

I like this store because they more often than not, have sales on their accessories. Usually if you buy one item get the other half price or something like that. They always have something cute in store and I usually pick something up although I don't shop that often since I make my own clothes. Sometimes you just can't resist factory labor clothing.  If you go up the winding staircase to the second floor, there are jeans and more clothing. If you sign up for their email they are always having 50-70% off sales online. They also cater to tall women, petite, and full-figured. A great place to shop if you are looking for office sexy clothes that are appropriate.

I was easily impressed with the service here. They don't hound you down like they do at Home Depot and I was able to find what I needed that they did not have at Home Depot. This location is nice and clean and i like that they have more of a selection of housewares, interior and exterior decorative goods vs Home Depot.

I don't know what the other reviewers are talking about, am I living in some parallel universe? Either this place has gotten progressively worse or some people just wouldn't know good food if it hit them in the ass. This place, while it is a good dive-type place to hang out, is terrible. We went on a Saturday and it was easy to find by its bright yellow paint and beer neon signs. Ordering was pleasant as the service was friendly, ordered some beers and went to go sit down. I really wanted to like this place because the atmosphere is pretty cool with pool tables, televisions and a jukebox. The men that were in the pool section were very loud and so was the music but I figured whatever, I'm not old so it's cool.  However, when it gets so that you can't hear the other person across from you because the music and rowdy guys are so loud, then we have a problem. The girl told us she would bring us some chips, and when they came it was so pitiful I had to wonder if this was a leftover basket from another table. There was a ridiculously small amount of chips in the basket and they were cold and almost stale. The salsa was nothing to sneeze at either so I just stopped eating it. When the food came, it looked good but they got my order wrong so I had to send it back. My boyfriend got the carne asada burrito which he said tasted good. The prices are pretty much the same as any Filiberto's or Armando's ect., and so are the food selections.   There are pictures of the meals on the wall just like at Armando's but at Armando's you get a big portion as well. The burrito he got was small. I had gotten my burrito enchilada style and when they brought back the right order it was overflowing off the plate with enchilada sauce, I was like, wtf? Don't they think they went a little overboard? The cheese on top was so fake and low-quality tasting. There was a big hunk of celery in the rice, and they put ranch over the lettuce and tomato garnish which is a huge no-no. The beans were the saving grace but the rice was almost flavorless. Just save your time and go to Armando's or Filiberto's, but if you want to just grab some beers then I guess this is the place to do it if your strictly in the neighborhood. I sat there the whole time thinking how much better I could have cooked the same meal if we had just bought the ingredients at the store. Maybe it's time to open that darn restaurant of mine if places like this can exist.

Avoid unless you are at dire straits with your gas tank. This is in a bad neighborhood, I should know it is the one I grew up in, and why does it seem like they ripped off the Dinosaurs show with the dinosaur logo and the name 'Sinclair?'

$25 microchipping, $35 FIV & leukemia for cats. I adopted my fat tabby, Miz Swee D from the clutches of death. Expect to leave feeling depressed and defeated because you cannot adopt all of the sweet animals in this place. The adoption process was very painless and quick, although I noticed that they don't ask a lot of questions many of the no-kill shelters ask. Reading their statistics report I cannot justify buying a pet from a pet store when thousands upon thousands of cats and dogs are being put to death every year.   If you search their website you can look for a certain breed you prefer, I was looking for an Alaskan Malamute which they had!

Ok ok I change my review, this place is awesome!! Super friendly people and cool vibe but I didn't change my stance until I tried the 911 just now. A delicious iced or hot drink for those who prefer very strong iced coffee like me. A must-have now for all of the traveling and road trips that I do.

I was pleasantly surprised with their chutney bar, wow, so many amazing chutneys to try. I can't really comment on the hot factor since I don't really consider a ghost pepper to be particularly hot, so you're on your own there.   The giant dosa we received was filled with a potato filling, and was very delicious. The paneer butter masala was creamy and flavorful, but not overpowering. The customer service was very friendly and they seem to have very cheap lunch specials that allow you to sample some of their best dishes!

The perfect little grocery store for when you don't know what to cook or eat. They have many prepared meals ready to pop into the oven or microwave. The best part of the store is the bakery section, some of the best red velvet cake I have ever eaten. Really any of their sweets are way better than some of those cupcake stores around the valley that are really subpar.

After staying in China for some time, I am always happy to see some nostalgic reminders wherever I can find them. The Super L Ranch Market, Lee Lee market, and Mekong Plaza are my go to places here in Arizona. I am always torn between this place and Lee Lee's, both smell like fish but that's okay! For me, I found that this place has a better and cheaper produce selection. I was able to buy a couple of eggplants for under $2. However, Lee Lee's takes the cake for sweet goods. The Super L Ranch Market is a fun place to get red bean pancakes made just for you outside of the store.   This place is like a sauce mecca, my quest to find my favorite gyoza sauce did not disappoint. They must have at least two aisles full of different kinds of sauces. The service is very friendly, I highly recommend!

I kinda feel sad about the two (2) star reviews, because this place is really good. I avoided this place for 3 1/2 years now (as long as it's been here) because it looked a little sketchy from the outside and I thought it was just one of those gross Mexican food places to eat at. I now find myself kicking myself. The hot dog cart is outside the entrance and all you have to do is go in and pay for your dog inside and they give you a ticket that you show the man outside to order. $3 for a pretty decent Sonoran dog grilled on a griddle, wrapped in Mesquite-smoked bacon, topped with chopped tomatoes, onions, shredded yellow or cotijo cheese, tomatillo salsa or red chili sauce, pinto beans, mayonnaise, ketchup and/or mustard, and served on a bun with a fresh-roasted chili.   Oddly enough, I liked that the menus are on five different flat screen tv's. The Carne Asada burrito was phenomenal, way better than any other Mexican fast food restaurant. The salsas were tasty which is something that is very important since I always start the meal by drinking some salsa. If it is good, then the restaurant is good. Smoked chile and garlic salsa is always welcome! The green guacamole sauce is great!  The tortillas are super soft and the beans were homemade, nice texture and flavor. I still prefer the rice at La Tolteca (but hey, no one can compete with that place) but it was still moist and flavorful. They seemed to have a lot of employees working here for such a small place but that's a good thing because the place was very clean and they brought our food to us.

The animal technician was extremely friendly and she was so nice to our pets that we just adopted from the humane society. Dr. Funk was very nice and took his time to examine each pet (we had a guinea pig and a rat) and even took the time to play with the rat and tried to teach her some tricks. He showcased our guinea pig to everyone else in the office as he is a big rat! Over 4 pounds of pig, he is the biggest pig I have ever owned or seen ever. Very nice doctor and answered any questions we had which were not many since we are very well familiar with rats and guinea pigs for many years. Very clean and nice animal hospital.

Everything is authentic and fresh, no out of the can crap here. If you have been to the Olympic Flame restaurant down the street on Thomas, this is the same owner of the joint. Salads are always fresh, no premixed junk here and the baklava is melt in your mouth.  The tiramisu is the treat of the whole evening. Just shut up and get the hell over there for some awesome food, were not writing a book here. They bring the food right to your table and they honestly do care a lot for their customers. Amin usually knows all of the customers by name.

Every time we come by, "Amin how is business?"   "Good, the people never stop eating." Admittedly the place is a little divey but they keep it clean, and every time I come here I am reminded of why small business rock; they remember you and become like family.  I used to live in back behind the restaurant so I used to eat here several times a week and coming in today reminded me that I wished I still lived in that tiny apartment as a college student behind a pizza shop. The sauce is awesome.

Stop by and have them make you a hot dog in the back in their little home like kitchen. It's seriously very cute and the place is basically a hotspot for all that is Pittsburgh Steelers, duh. Stop by if you are getting hungry from roaming the antique mall, and believe me, you will be starving by the time you roam that huge place full of antiques. The only thing I wished he had was a soda machine with ice instead of only canned beverages. Just look for Merchant Square Antiques building and it's right inside to the left of Guest Services when you walk in.

Awesome workers! I have been noticing lately that the workers seem to be in a better mood, or maybe that is just because these are new replacement workers. Hmm..  Don't forget every other Sat. is 50% off and you can always tell what the sale is that day by looking for the colored balloons floating from the signs in the front of the store. No more asking random, cranky strangers if they know what the color is that day, or hunting down the nearest employee. We all forget, come on.  Not sure what store this used to be, but the layout is weird because everything is sectioned off and the mens/kids/linens/women's shoes section is located down a ramp which I was tempted to race my cart down. Eh, I like the quirkiness of this place!

I don't know what kind of crack these reviewers must be on but let me have some. This place is so awful I came straight home just so I could yelp about it, and not in a good way. I like that it's open really late but it's like we said on the ride home, "Hey now we know where to come and eat really crappy food late at night." We stumbled onto this place because Pete's was closed by the time we got down here. My falafel was dry and crumbly and the pita was like something you get out of a bag at the store.   The Greek fries were a joke, cold and soggy with not very flavorful Parmesan cheese on it. My partners Lamb Souvlaki plate came with rice that was entirely  void of flavor and didn't look that good to begin with. The waiter brought the wrong order to the table and I saw other people getting up to see where their order was. Do yourself a favor and stay away

Great service, didn't buy a bike here but brought one in to be serviced. The guys were super nice and friendly. I was really pleased by the selection of bikes that they have at this store, pretty much any unique design that you may be looking for they may have. Also this is the place for crazy accessories for your bike like seahorse horns and flags etc.

I think this Savers is getting their layout confused with Goodwill, which is like Target getting confused with Walmart; both in the same category, just one is more classier than the other. I used to live by this Savers and would frequent it every day yes, literally every day back when they used to have great items. Just pop in real quick. Over time they changed the layout and experimented with things.   After visiting today I saw that now everything is so crowded based on the way they structured everything using the same space with the same amount of stuff. The shoes are racked above the clothes racks now. This is extremely, extremely annoying. There is no emoticon to express how annoyed I am by this move. I understand they are trying to make the shoes central to the clothes so they are in the same spot, the shoes are racked by size of course snaking down each aisle. Sooo to look at shoes you have to go down a couple of aisles waiting for people to get out of your way, rather than have them in one spot like they used to be. Of course people are not going to magically put back shoes where they belong so you might find shoes in the right place, or you might end of having to walk down each and every aisle looking at the shoe size stickers making sure they are not cute and your shoe size respectively. Savers, please correct this annoying inconvenience.   Also if you genuinely find an item with a tag missing they won't sell the item to you. Listen I get it, this is such a high traffic thrift store that there is a good reason for this but you must wait until the next day for them to price the item and put it back, they won't hold it for you. They don't call a manager over to simply price the item out for you, so how is this good customer service for the innocent ones? Why punish everyone? Why not do like some other stores do and mark the clothing label with a washable marker so that way if the price tag comes off, based on the color they have a pricing system set up? Either way, end up taking the time to re-price and re-stock it again.   They should also implement some type of buzzer at the jewelry counter, I don't know how many times I have gone there, not just this location, only to wait and wait finally having to ask a cashier to send someone over to help me because there is never anyone there. The service is always impatient at the counter too, I don't know about you but I like to make up my mind about a purchase! This place is just too picked over, it is nothing like it used to be in its heyday. Way crowded on weekends and busy in the evening. If you bring donations you get a coupon for $3-5 off your min $10 purchase with a tax deductible tag. I will say housewares are your best bet here, good condition and best prices. If you are looking for generic clothing fine, but diamond in the rough stuff like I am accustomed to? no, you won't find that here.

I had a really good time here, despite being almost frozen to death. We came in somewhat late at night (1030) and we ordered a garlic feta cheese pizza. There were some other guys in there watching the Suns game that had gone into overtime. That pizza hit the spot, cheesy, gooey and the sauce was fabulous. The root beer out of the bottle was ice cold and it was just great to sit there and eat a pizza with the guys and watch the game. A definite must to hit up for late night pizza.   Make your mark by drawing on the walls.

Sweet smokes, although I don't smoke I just come here with people who do. But if I did this would be one of the places I would go. Tax free! Gets really busy at times and they have a gas station. Just don't smoke and fill up at the same time.

Let me just lead with: you can find Willet single barrel bourbon at Total Wine for $38. I buy all of my club soda here for $3 when most stores always charge $5-6 for a six pack. The store is laid out well and the employees are very friendly. They have a HUGE selection of liquor not just *wine.*I don't know how they get these low prices, and frankly, I don't care. Just keep the vino coming!

I have found this Savers and declared it to be much better than the others. They keep it pretty clean and organized and the place is not overrun by children. I found many books that I had long ago forgot about here. The housewares are sometimes a hit and miss as they can be way overpriced.   Even though I am a grown ass adult I still find myself walking over to the toy section and checking out what kind of toys they have for sale which are usually in pretty good condition. Good selection of shoes and purses. I did happen to find some great buys here. Save yourself a couple of hours to be able to properly shop in a thrift store.

naa, Bad Savers! Bad!  I used to come in here all of the time and they had great stuff and not only that, they were at great prices. Now they have a lot of dumpy stuff to say it ineloquently. Ladies if you go in the back to find awesome purses, there are now only ugly purses or cheap knockoff purses that they price expensively. Right, like no one can tell these are not real.  Clothes, they just do not have anything good anymore, previously there were good brands and nice styles. Of course this is subjective but I'm just giving you a general idea here. Shoes are just as bad, brands are obscure and anything you would remotely consider, maybe just to say you have something, are priced way too much.   Men's ties are a wreck and so are the belts, you can however find nice ones for women. I can at least say their book selection is good, I found a lot of good finds there. Housewares, well that's another story. I understand that they are trying to make money here and that the money is going to a good cause, but what's the point if people can't afford or won't buy items that are priced too highly?  I saw a crystal pitcher in there that was nice, it was no Baccarat Crystal but one of those pitchers you might find at Ross for say $24 bucks, and I said to myself okay that looks nice, maybe $15-20 give or take would be fair. I turn it over to see the price and it was $50.00. The only thing I saw there that was a steal was a nice couch that they marked for $25, the next day was a 50% off day so someone got the couch for $12.50. Even another customer remarked, "Wow only $25? they usually mark up everything too high."  One man kindly gave me his coupon for 50% off. You can get these apparently by donating a large bag of items or clothing. They are only good for that day, and only good on clothing, shoes and linens. So not housewares that include dishes, appliances, furniture.   What happened to you Savers? I guess I have to break up with you before I cheat on you. I am now moving on to other independent thrift stores. It's not you, it's me.

Messy, fresh, juicy, greasy, and delish. The owner seems passionate about his store and he lets you know the moment you walk in that door. They were frying up several pounds of bacon when we arrived so it smelled amazing.  The burger was satisfying but I wasn't really feeling the special sauce a lot of people seem to love that you can get as a side for your fries, and it comes on the burger. Other than that, the chili fries were so good.Think crispy fries smothered with actually tasty chili and cheese. I wish I could have tried the Italian beef everyone seems to go on about, but I only have one stomach people.

I will say the best part about the whole place is the Apple store, biggest one I have seen thus far. However, getting into the place and parking is a nightmare. Either there is too little of it on the sides or most of it is valet parking only. The place is like a little village of shopping. Just too far of a drive and it didn't leave enough impression to make the drive worthwhile. I can't see how this place can be very popular during the summertime seeing as it is outdoor shopping.

This is a little hidden gem of a thrift store, tucked away in an almost empty strip mall next to the PGA superstore. This is a great place to find books, as they have a pretty good section of books, and vintage books. If you like to collect and perhaps, cook with old vintage cookbooks, this is the place to look. That fish gelatin recipe has to come from somewhere.  Some items in their condition can be a hit or miss, but you can really find some nice things here for a great price that you would not at Goodwill. They have a really great selection on furniture if you are looking for living room furniture. I know how hard these items are to find at thrift stores. The employees are pretty friendly as well.

Yay, Circle K has these vitamin serums that you can put in your drinks that are super cool. Not sure if a huge soda with vitamins would do the job but I guess every bit helps. Kinda like ordering a cheeseburger and getting a diet soda? From what I can remember: Vitamin B12 Energy boost and 6 others I don't remember but you get the gist.

Wow, is all I can say. Well, I guess I will say a bit more since this is a review. I have never seen such a thorough exam in my life. The staff was pleasant, especially the eyeglass frames consulting guy (sorry, don't remember his name). The actual exam took about an hour, a literal hour, which to me was very excellent because they checked out everything. I don't know how long I have been going to those places that do your exam for $29 and it ends up taking about 10 minutes literally for the exam.   One time I went to the Alex Optical at AZ Mills and I knew she did it too quickly, sure enough, my eyeglasses were nowhere near powerful enough. I was not able to find any eyeglass frames that I liked and they gave me no issues about it, gave me my prescription to buy my eyeglasses somewhere else. I was happy I listened to the reviews because now I have an eye person! I would gladly return here again for all of my eyeball needs.

Awesome location and is my go-to place in the area. I have been to every single location in the state and the pricing is better than most I have been to. Yes, the pricing can be high for some items at Goodwill, but I can't tell you how many rare and valuable items I have found sleuthing thrift stores in the valley. Sometimes I will spend that $25 for a collectible only to find out at home it is worth $400. Some items however are way too high, especially if you know you can find the exact same thing at the store brand new for a few dollars more. So it pays to know antiques and values for items. If you like to shop a lot, you are well on your way!  The furniture selection tends to dwindle in the evenings, this is a popular location so if you are looking for nice furniture, get here early. There is usually very slim pickings at night and they don't really put anything new out at this time either (furniture wise). This location has a ton of everything you want, some Goodwills vary on the amount they carry. Plenty of housewares, bagged items, purses, linens, toys, books, shoes, and clothes. I know everyone at this location and everyone is pretty friendly. Don't forget to sign up for their email every month for 20% off, they take the coupon on your smartphone! Create a folder in your email labeled "Goodwill coupon" and just save the email to that folder every month. Easy access. No more searching through hundreds of emails feebly while the cashier and people behind you are getting impatient! Trust me, I am guilty of this.   50% off weekends are every other weekends, but those days are swamped with people. It is worth it though, just come early!

We were in the area looking at homes in Verrado and used Yelp to search for nearby restaurants. At first glance this appears to be a busy family pizzeria. We placed our order and sat down. The Margherita pizza was crispy but the sauce tasted like the same sauce that is used for their pasta, the mozzarella was a little sparse as someone else mentioned, and the big no-no was the use of dried basil. A little pricey at $17.   The other huge factor in my rating was the service. We had to ask for everything, including a pizza server, and they gave us a cheese grater! The waitress answered everything very curtly and never asked us if everything was okay, despite asking and attending to everyone else's needs around us. I literally heard the next table being asked four times if their food was okay and if they needed anything. I am not sure if you get anything for free when you dine in as another reviewer mentioned, because we didn't receive anything. I do not like to frequent places where they have a major attitude or are cliquey. I would not return here again nor recommend this to anyone. I can usually overlook surly service if the food is excellent, but in this case, not even the food was up to par.

I was pretty happy with my recent visit. The sales people behind the counter were friendly and put up with my endless questions and requests to see different items. The place looks to be small on the outside but it is a pretty decent size on the inside. I was surprised they were able to fit a lot of merchandise into such a space, so the selection was pretty decent compared to every other smoke shop I have been to in Phoenix. For me, the prices were pretty reasonable, about the same as other places in the valley. Overall, I will be stopping here whenever I need something over a few other shops.

We contacted this place after some research on google and talking to the owner Joe. We called late and he was eating dinner, so we apologized but he said he would call us back that same night. He called back about 30 min later and listened to what we needed and really went above and beyond to explain what the process was for cremation, the cost, and how long it would all take. He also instructed us on what we needed to do with the body in the meantime until we could make it down there in two days. Other places we called were really not friendly, and didn't take the initiative to explain anything.   He was very nice on the phone and we made an appointment, he was also the cheapest option of all of the other places we called. Pricing was not really a huge importance to us, but I felt as though some places were price gouging pet owners. We met Joe and we sat down and filled out the paperwork. He asked us about our pet and showed a lot of interest, like he actually cared. Then he walked us through the facility, showed us the crematory oven, and explained each and every step that he was going to do with our pet. He also offers a ceremony where you can be there when they put your pet in the oven. That was too emotional for us so we opted out of that. I am not sure what the cost was for that, but it was reasonable.   We said our goodbye's, left our pet with Joe, went and ate breakfast, and Joe called us about two hours later. The whole process didn't take very long due to the size of our pet. We came back and the ashes were tastefully sealed in plastic inside of a memorial tube with his name wrapped around it. This would be nice to display by itself, but we opted to buy a lead crystal urn and put the ashes inside a velvet bag and into the urn. The whole ordeal was very respectful, affordable, and the owner really went out of his way to make us feel welcome, respected, and was very empathetic. I would highly recommend this service if you find yourself in this unfortunate predicament.   Finding the business was a little tricky since it was in an industrial part of Phoenix, but Joe came out to find us.

Extremely indifferent service as soon as I walked in, and I noticed this with all of the other customers standing in line. No hello, thank you etc. This was the only location nearby in Tempe, I thought they had more locations but the other nearest one is on Central. I go to the Central location a lot which is pretty good, they have a fair amount of office workers who frequent the place. I noticed a drastic difference in the taste of the smoothies compared to the other location. I tasted someone else's Tutti Frutti smoothie which is supposed to taste exactly like Froot Loops, but instead tasted like a very sugary Orange Julius. My peach smoothie tasted good with the flavor of peaches but seriously lacked a sugar component. I don't really like a lot of sugar but it's supposed to be sweetened with fruit juice, instead it tasted like unripe peaches.  We went back to get a replacement for someone's drink, but that also tasted just as lackluster. I say, save the trip and go to another location.

Awesome, I was a bit apprehensive after reading some of the negative reviews but I figured there were more positive than negative, every other urgent care has low ratings in the area, and most of the negative reviews didn't necessarily involve the care they received. Plus, not being able to breathe kinda takes precedence over anything else.   I woke up not being able to breathe normally and after refusing to go get help, I finally gave in when night came and I was still the same. I saw that this place was open late and we headed on down to the clinic. They were not busy at all (we came at 6pm and they are open until 10pm), with 5-6 people ahead of me. They called me back in 30 minutes! The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. There were two people in front, a young girl and a young man. The office furniture had seen better days, but everything was clean which is the most important thing in my book.  So I went back and the first nurse was nice and took my vitals, I went to another room and another nurse took me to get an X-ray after 5 minutes. The x-ray tech was nice and took his time to explain what he was doing and why he was doing it. After my x-ray, it only took 10 minutes for the practitioner to come in. I was expecting someone kinda grumpy as you sometimes get when you come to places such as this, but nurse Linder rocked! He was super nice, explained my accurate treatments and prescriptions, and I left being able to breathe again!  He even made sure I was okay after my treatment and talked to me some more about my condition even though he was very busy. The whole visit only took two hours (again, I received a treatment that took 20-25 minutes, most people don't need this), instead of waiting two hours at a clinic. In an emergency, I now have a reliable clinic to go to!

Dana is awesome! The receptionist is very accommodating and welcoming. We went in for the community acupuncture session to try out this place. It is only $25 for almost 2 hours! It is $20 if you can pay cash. The place has a very serene quality to it as soon as you walk in. From the smells of essential oils, to the strawberry infused water, this place instantly relaxes you once you come inside. No cliquey, granola vibe about this place, which is what I hate about some others.   We explained some of our issues but she was able to know what our problems were very quickly. A good sign of any caring practitioner should be the patient feedback. While I was waiting, three clients came out from their appointments and gave her a hug each time. Other patients waiting were only talking about how great and caring she was. I don't see this becoming an every week thing for me, but I will most definitely return for another session next month.

Coming off of Rand's suggestion and well, free rooms we get from my father in law for spending (blowing?) a lot of money in this place, we stayed at Bally's. The casino area is crowded but they usually have someone on stage performing and you get to really experience the excitement of the casino atmosphere. Check in can be a nightmare, so slow at times but if you are VIP, they have a checkout/in for that.   The rooms are pretty quiet, we stayed in the North Tower for three days if that helps. Prices for rooms seemed reasonable. Although the rooms were free, I can confirm that the LV sandwich trick does work here. Shhh, don't tell them I sent you! Eat a Gordon Ramsey Burger in Paris downstairs!

I hate going to places only to be vigilant over everything that I requested, can't anyone ever write anything down and go down a list and check what has been done off? The first time we visited here was actually not so bad, the young sales guy was pretty friendly and was not pushy. He told us about all of our options and since he saw that our headlights were looking pretty foggy he suggested we get the buffing treatment on them that would make them look like new. We came before they closed so I think everyone wanted to get out of there.   We got the most expensive wash and the headlamp buffing, which he gave us a discount and that brought our whole total up to $70. He asked us what scent we wanted and then our car was off to be washed. He told us about the chair massagers inside which we did not try but you can get a good massage while you wait in these big leather recliners. Inside it is like a little mini mart, they have snacks and car accessories and you pay the cashier inside while you wait.  When our car came out they did not drive it to the detailing section instead they drove it around to where the washing entrance was and dried the car and what I assumed was a hand wax. They also did the headlamps and a quick vacuuming. When the car was ready there was still spots on the windshield and quite a few stuck on bugs that I think should have come off in the wash or the workers should have wiped them off. However we were in a hurry for date night and didn't want to bother with it, and the upside was that the headlamps did look great. They did not look like they just came out of the manufacturers box but they looked clear and smooth, which was surprising and much cheaper than replacing both lamps.   We also noticed that there was no smell in the car, which we had asked for cherry. My partner let someone inside know and they came out and sprayed the car. Since it was night when we drove off we did not notice too much but the next day in the daylight we noticed that the car really did not look clean, the tires were not shined and on top of that they did not do anything to the interior despite the wash we had purchased! Everything still looked dull and dirty. So the next day my partner went back and asked to talk to management. The same guy was still there and agreed that they had not done a good job and let him go through the wash again for free and made sure that the interior was cleaned this time.  The difference was like night and day, he brought the car home and the inside was extremely shiny from leather cleaner, all of the dirty spots were spotless, the tires were shined, the car looked cleaner on the outside and they had put more fragrance inside. (On a side note the smell does not last long at all, this time we got cinnamon and it really only lasts for about 2-3 hours so maybe it's a good idea for a date night or something.) Still those pesky bugs persisted, there were significantly less this time though.  So why the one star? I can accept someone messing up and then making it right even though we had to go back twice but the next time we came for a basic wash, the young guy was not there. Instead there was another man and we let him know we were just interested in the quick basic wash that was $6.99. He asked us if were interested in one of their annual passes and my partner said no very politely (although if it were me I would have answered with a grumpily no because he did not look or sound friendly to begin with), that we were just going with the basic wash today. To this he sneered "yeah, whatever" and walked away to talk on his cell phone. To this I thanked him for his great customer service skills with a one finger salute as we drove by to enter the wash.   When you purchase their more expensive washes you do get another free wash within a week but you will probably need that wash just to fix the first one.

Pretty good prices at $14 for two people, the area seemed to be reasonably kept up, and the cashier was pretty friendly. No, you are not going to get the best picture quality but sometimes the nostalgia is worth it. FYI-I would not watch something like Jurassic World here again, too many graphics that need to be seen up closer and in high quality. The best times to go is late at night, less people and if you are watching a horror movie I can only assume you might get creeped out. Did I just hear a metal hook scraping the side of the car?  We used to go to the Scottsdale 6 before they closed, now this is the only one of its kind. People are going to once now and again, turn their cars on to keep their batteries from dying. We opened up our sunroof and enjoyed a movie under the stars. It looked like it was going to rain so I could only hope the screens didn't tear away like in that movie Twister. The bringing your own food is awesome because you don't only have to rely on unhealthy junk food (although popcorn is a must!) from the snack bar. You could bring a whole spaghetti dinner if you wanted! Some people make a night out of it by bringing tv dinner tables and folding chairs. Nice way to get together with your family.

My only beef with CVS is that they are so much more expensive than the other convenience drugstores. I love this location just adjacent from the courthouse. Watch those huge stairs, I am not sure if there is a handicap ramp entrance but at least the entrance right off of Jefferson is accessible by stairs. Yes, they stock booze to help you get through your work day.

Very nice luggage store with knowledgeable salespeople. If you are looking for higher end luggage that is actually very sturdy and reliable, this is the place for you. The luggage that I was looking at came with a two year warranty that you can replace with normal wear and tear. Salesman greeted us very promptly and answered all of our questions and made the experience enjoyable rather than dealing with grumpy salespeople.

We have a pretty hilarious story about how we got so desperately lost trying to find the performing arts center on campus. We asked many people and I don't understand why it was so hard, but there is not so great signage to direct you. Of course, it doesn't help if you are not from the area and not familiar. Anyhow, we found the place and parking was very easy and ample. We were in attendance for the Mark Twain Tonight! performance by Hal Holbrook, which was excellent by the way.  There are many stairs to get to your seat, if you have mobility issues you may want to purchase in an accessible area. Every seat was great, so if you get a row farther away from the stage it is still a comfortable view.

I really like UltraStar, they gave me a prize pack for The Conjuring, which I was there to see for the second time. It does not seem that they get very busy, or maybe that I arrived at a time (thursday night) when they were not. Not a very pretentious theater, you are immediately greeted by the concession stand and the guest/ticket services are to your left. A bit different since I am used to attending the AMC/Harkins theaters with their box office jutting out at you. Customer service was friendly although it was a little confusing deciding beforehand where to sit for their Star Class seating.   The ticket worker was nice enough to let us peek into a theater beforehand to see how the theater looks. We chose the perfect seat: a middle row two seat recliner. Everything went smoothly save for some clueless girls who were sitting in our seats. After we disposed of them, the seats were very comfortable! The popcorn needs work though, the kernels were too small. I did not participate in the bar/coffee bar situation they had going on, but I will always come back to this theater for one reason: the D-Box seats!

I walked in here in full costume during a tournament and no one blinked an eye. I have my favorite haunts in the valley and Tucson for comic books, so I decided to check this place out since we were in the area.  The customer service seemed friendly and helpful. Plenty of figures and Creepy comics, I'm a fan!

Their business statement is so true:  Arizona Firearm's is Tempe's PRIEMER firearms dealer and one of Arizona's oldest guns shops with 40 years of experience. We come here so often I already am familiar with everyone and everyone is very down to earth and friendly. These guys know what they are talking about which is a relief, nothing is more irritating than clueless service. Collecting for our zombie survival gear or rather shooting practice gear we picked up a Remington 870 Tactical with Serrated Flash Suppressor, Glock G21, and a Ruger 10/22 to add to our ever growing kit.  They also do trades and layaways and they price matched a handgun for us since another shop was offering it for less. Although don't hold me to that, just check with them to see what they can do for you. They have surplus and antique items which were interesting to look at, I feel as though I could just come in here to browse for hours. It can be hard to miss since it is a small single-story shop, it's right off Priest and University next to an apartment complex. Happy Shooting!

I really disagree with the saying that this place is the same as Panda Express, that place is gross. While the place is not better than say, China Way, it is still pretty decent for Americanized Chinese food. The lo mein was pretty decent and she brought us all of our dishes complete with all of the sauces; sweet and sour, hot mustard. (see photos.)  The portions were pretty big and if you don't think so, the other counties are right, we Americans do not know about portion control. My partner received the Mongolian beef which looked pretty decent and was declared as such, I don't know I don't eat meat so I couldn't tell you.   Everything arrived piping hot and it took a little while as they were making everything to order. I did not experience the blandness that the others speak of as everything was well seasoned and the sauces were very flavorful. I thought with a name like Wang's this place has got to be bad, but it turned out to be not so bad.

After fleeing for our lives from another 24 hour laundromat nearby, we were thankful to find this other 24 hour laundromat to dry our clothes. We took our wet clothes and ran from the other place. Pretty quiet only one other person doing laundry and some guy who was sleeping hidden by the washers against the wall. (he never bothered us)  A little messy with some clothes left behind and some dryer sheets on the floor but again the staff is only here until 2pm so I guess it's up to the public to clean up after themselves, imagine that. Big flat screen tv, games, vending machine full of "good" junk food, and College Times to tide you over. There is also free wifi and places to sit with tables so you can bring your laptop. No experience with the wash and fold service since we came after 11pm but the dryers worked great. My new 24 hour laundromat.

This is still a good place to get your laundry done late, which is the only time we can do our laundry. Searches will usually turn up empty for a 24 hour laundromat. Of course there are no employees late at night, and the bathroom is locked. I assume this is due to the number of homeless people that frequent this laundromat to watch the tv, sleep, and use the restroom.   Most of them are harmless and I usually give them a buck or two, but you have to make sure you really are aware of who is around you. One time we came here and I was folding my laundry, a guy comes in from the back entrance and starts to mess around with the laundry sink. I look over and he looks kind of sinister, but I didn't want to stare. Then he starts cleaning a razor sharp knife out of nowhere with a cloth! There were others doing laundry too and we all kind of looked at each other not knowing what to think. It was definitely one of those Uhhhhh....moments. I didn't know whether to bust out laughing or run in terror. A good place to catch characters and get your clothes clean for sure.  p.s. we left some clothes here by accident and the employees found them, folded them, and held them for us in one of their laundry bags (they do laundry services too). So the employees totally rock!

Whew! This place gets super busy on a Sunday. So busy that some people had to leave to go somewhere else. The inside is a little small so you may have to end up getting your food to go. We came in and ordered takeout which consisted of menudo, a quesadilla, and a Carne Asada burrito. They do not have fountain drinks or ice, and it is bottle or cans only.   Our order took about a half hour to come out. When we got home the burrito was tender and seasoned very nicely, and it had a nice smokiness to it. The quesadilla was good, but I don't know how anyone could really mess up a quesadilla. A little bit of cilantro on the inside added a nice touch. The menudo had a nice broth with plenty of tripe. I would've preferred a little bit more hominy in it, as it had a lot of tripe, but I guess generally the complaint is that there isn't enough tripe. It came with all of the general fixings: onions, cilantro, red pepper paste, and limes. I look forward to returning here again, but perhaps a bit earlier and maybe not on a Sunday.

Awesome workers who actually know what they are talking about. I can't wait to return. Upon asking an employee which wet food is the best for my cat, we got into a discussion about how raw food is actually better for her. I knew that but it was refreshing to actually have a conversation with an employee who takes an interest and actually has knowledge about such things. He pointed me to a bestseller in the store that they have gotten great feedback about.   I actually came here for Vibactra which they actually had ($28.99 if anybody needs to know), it is an all natural, powerful antibiotic, anti-parasitic for animals. They have a large selection of raw dog and cat food, including freezers full of what I can only assume are organic meats and bones.   If you like bling for your pet, they have rhinestone collars for reasonable prices~8.99 and up. They have bakery treats for your dog although I could not confirm where they receive their baked goods from. Overall, based on their many holistic products and great customer service, I would gladly visit this location again.

I thought this place was going to be better based on reviews but I guess not. You enter in through the hookah place next door and you are obligated to get your own drinks. I love Indian food, I make it at home all of the time but sometimes I like to venture out. The lowdown:  *I got the tikka masala fries and they were good but they desperately needed salt. *Mattar paneer also needed salt and spice, I thought this food was supposed to be full of flavor and spice?No creamy texture and the cheese was rubbery and more firm than it is supposed to be.  *My partner's lamb curry was sadly laden with oil and you could see the separation between the tomato curry and the oil sitting on top. The biggest part of the lamb that was saved for last was mostly, if not all fat.  *Basmati rice needed salt as well, and I'm not a salt fiend! More oil would have helped to make it moist.  *Garlic Naan was crispy and hot.  In conclusion: tikka masala fries and naan were good. I was disappointed at the lack of flavor everything had. If you want one of the best experiences go to Royal Taj here in Tempe, if you want some of the best Indian food in your life go to Delhi Palace in Flagstaff at Woodlands Village.

I don't understand why there are different reviews on the app and different ones on the computer but okay.  If you like sugar, sugar and more sugar flavor then you have come to the right place. These are huge cupcakes for 3.25 which I like, with tons of frosting which I also like. However the cakes are missing one important ingredient: moisture and authentic flavor.  The red velvet cupcake tastes very artificial and I sincerely doubt there was any cocoa in it. It tasted like artificial flavoring and food coloring. To say it tasted like Duncan Hines is an insult to Duncan Hines. The chocolate cake was the same, lacking moisture and taste. The frosting on the red velvet is supposed to have a rich, creamy cream cheese frosting but the frosting was more like powdered sugar with butter. That's it, just a sugar flavor.  The chocolate frosting was the same, no chocolate taste hardly in the frosting, only sugar. I feel terrible we wasted over $7 on cupcakes in this place. Is says, "As seen on Cupcake Wars" on the door and they have other locations in the valley. I am not sure if it is this location only or not but they need to improve. Fresh N' Easy has better cupcakes than this place from the Hermosa Baking Co. and that's sad considering this place specializes in cupcakes and they cannot even get that right.

I loved how everyone was so friendly and I found some really good deals that you cannot find most of the time on ebay, craigslist etc. If you come here with $50 you can potentially walk out with a lot of stuff! Giant print screen blankets for $19, nail polishes and hair accessories for $1, lots of beautiful jewelry and food.  Bre's bakery makes a delicious red velvet cupcake! There are tons of cheap toys for your little one and let's not forget clothes and fireworks! Only open on FRI, SAT, and SUN 10am-6pm.

How to write a review for a burger shop:  Offer some background: Flame burger is the newest burger concept to hit the valley. We're up to our ears in burgers people! Located in the now defunct El Pollo Loco in the Target East Valley strip mall, is the latest burger joint to focus on flame grilled burgers with various topping options at their topping bar. When you walk in, the place has a diner look complete with umbrellas. Flame Burger uses Niman meats, now I know some of you that know me, know that I am a vegetarian so how the hell is a vegetarian reviewing a burger shop? lol Well they had a veggie burger thank you so I could eat there, and my partner eats meat. Anyway back to the story err... review. According to their website, Niman Ranch is composed of small U.S. family farmers who are dedicated to raising their livestock under "the strictest protocols," using "humane animal raising standards" to make the best tasting products.   The animals raised "naturally" means: never given hormones or antibiotics (ever for reals), fed a 100% vegetarian diet (me??), raised outdoors on pasture or in deeply bedded pens. "Humane animal care" means: livestock is raised outdoors, livestock always have access to fresh, clean water, and livestock are able to express their natural behaviors. Translation--Tasty meat.   Food: (all their sandwiches are named with the word 'Flame' in front of them') Like we're at the forefronts of hell and this is the devil's choice of sandwich or something. Like I already mentioned they offer a veggie burger, they also offer a turkey burger, chicken sandwich, gyros, salads (Greek, Caesar, Garden, Flame), kids meals, breakfast burritos, Ciabatta sandwiches, cheesecake, flan, Chicago Red Hot dogs and sausages. They use waffle fries but also offer chili fries. No alcohol, only soda  sorry guys.  Pricing: About the same as most fast food joints-$5.00 for the Original Flame (includes burger, fries, and what appeared to be a large drink), $5-7 for all other combo meals including the other meat options, doubles, dogs and gyros. Single sandwiches $3-5 (incl. doubles), break burritos $3-4, Ciabatta sandwiches $3-4, kids meals are $3 and dogs range from $2-4. Altogether pretty affordable. Our total after tax that left us very full was $14.19.  Pros for me-if they can make a veggie burger taste like a real burger, they're all right in my book. The bun was toasted and grilled, they use a nicely textured patty that tasted like a turkey burger not with all that chunky crap I don't like, the fries were crispy and salty. I felt dirty eating this meal like a regular carnivore, instead of light and airy. I felt like I should be eating this in a seedy motel before returning home to my wife and trying to explain away the burger essence.  My partner said his burger was "groin-grabbingly good!" jeez way to embarrass me honey, now I have to write that on Yelp. They offered excellent friendly service even though I showed up in my oversized, red nerd glasses with my "I'm a hot mess" with the pancakes and the melting butter graphic on it t-shirt on. They still smiled at me.  There is ample seating and plenty of outside seating even though it is still too warm to do so at this time of year.   Cons-too greasy like all burger meals to eat often. This place needs better signage since it is hidden away in a rambling strip mall that doesn't really have that many businesses in it. They do not offer cheddar as a cheese.   Side note: This place just opened this week, also has drive-thru.

A great time was had by all at their farmer's market and corn maze. I try to buy fresh produce whenever I can and what a better place to do it than on an actual working farm. The owner is so friendly and went out of his way to make sure we had what we needed. Since they are selling Christmas trees at this time of the year, they had leftover trimmed branches which he gave to me for free! I came home and made wreaths and centerpieces with them. I will definitely return here for the many family festivals they have going on here year around.

I love this store, they such an eclectic selection. It's so hard for me to find clothes that I usually drive to Tucson to find clothes as there is no such store that carries anything I like. The workers were very friendly and helped me with my every request. I was able to find 5 inch platform boots in neon pink, which may sound bizarre to some, but to me is just an awesome find for those parties crazy people like me go to. They sell a lot of local art, men's clothes, and funky accessories. Everything was reasonably priced, which is a big plus in my book. It is right next to the Yucca Tap Room.

This place is a zombie trap, meaning if you love zombies, you will more than likely love this store. Basically it's a surplus store with a little bit of everything you may need for survivalist reasons, but with zombies thrown in for good measure. They have a zombie arcade and a zombie truck outside you can take pictures of using the props. The owner was very friendly, as was the sales rep. Overall, a great store to stop by if you are into The Walking Dead and such.

I cannot really remember a time when I was a customer somewhere and I was treated so well with genuine friendliness. Not the "yeah you're spending money here so we will treat you nice," but like they want to become your friend or something. Da Burger Shack as I was told, has been at this location for about 8 months now which is probably why I never heard of it. The motto on their sign outside is "We welcome you like family not as a stranger." Which was hopeful, I'm a sucker for small town treatment.   We were greeted nicely upon coming in, I noticed that they had some sort of contraption that produces cold drip coffee. Looks cool and tastes great. The atmosphere was like a mix between Cheba Hut (w/o the marijuana references), Hippie Gypsy, and a tropical hut. Whoever decorated that place has great taste in music and icons. The setting was small but cozy and very colorful down to the tables being painted.  There was nice outdoor seating but it was too warm outside to brave the elements. I was shocked to see they offer something called the "Big Tsunami," which is 10 ground beef patties topped with pastramis, 10 slices of American cheese, 2 fried eggs, diced onion, tomatoes, lettuce, and their special sauce (which is fabulous btw) all for $20~if you get the combo for $1.75 more you get chili cheese fries and 2 drinks. It is recommended for 5 or more people. Then I noticed they have something called Big Moke Burger which is 4 patties with 4 slices of cheese, bacon, carmelized onions and so forth for $9. They also have a Hawaiian Loco Moco plate. Alas, I did not try the cheesecake I saw they had in their refrigerated case.   The food:  Fries-they give you a TON of fries for a regular order, I hate to see (or maybe love?) what a 'large' looks like. They seem to be the frozen crinkle kind. They were still good, my only suggestion is to maybe make homemade, proprietary house fries?  Burger-great, although I don't eat meat my partner loved his burger. It seemed to be loaded with bacon and I was assured it was quality bacon, not the cheap kind they give you at fast food places. They use really soft, buttery kaiser rolls for the bun. My only gripe is that I wish they would offer a Boca, Morningstar or  Amy's veggie patty instead of a squishy portabello mushroom. I just don't feel those textures match up with a bun.  Conclusion: so much good food for very little money, do not come here on a diet. Of course you could try to get away with it by eating their salads but come on, willpower is not your strong suit. During our meal the older gentleman checked on us and we chatted, I wanted to get up and give him a hug and I don't like touching people. So sweet to everyone who came in and everyone seemed to be regulars, it was like Cheers; he knew everyone's name. He's giving the owner from Tokyo House a run for his money in hospitality and I love that guy.   I have some Kiwi's from New Zealand that I would love to bring here and I'm sure they will love it. Mahalo Da Burger!

I have no idea how I ended up here, driving by I concluded that I didn't want to eat here. It looked like a non-descript, darkened window blah storefront but Boy am I glad I came back!  The lowdown *HUGE HUGE HUGE slices, it takes up a big pizza pan for only the one slice UNDER $4!Also comes with your own pizza roller to cut that baby up. *Whole pizzas are ridiculous, about the size of 2 large pizzas. *Always crisp never soggy, I hate soggy pizza~ Streets of NY I am looking at you! *Toppings are fresh not canned, sauce is excellent, crust nice flavor. *Thrifty ice cream *See photos for lunch specials  This is my off-diet day place to come. I wholeheartedly recommend this place because the people are actually very friendly. No hitting or throwing things at you! They look at you and smile! They actually thank you for coming! Unheard of these days to extend human kindness.

Wow, what more could you ask for: a Home Goods and Marshalls rolled into one. They have tons and tons of home decor, furniture, and clothing. Just think of it as a more upscale Ross without the screaming children and things thrown on the floor. There were sales associates around all of the time to ask questions. This goes without saying once you walk in, they have the cutest Halloween decor I have seen in a retail store! This is the place to haunt if you love Halloween.

I wouldn't say that the service was unfriendly but where was the service? Coming in was okay, and we sat outside so maybe that was our own undoing. I always feel when you sit outside, the waiters forget about you or something. It was so lovely out we didn't want to be cooped up inside though. The timeline went as follows:  -Drinks were ordered, took at least 10-15 minutes to get our basic order. Longer for the booze, it came a little before the meal and the waiter had to be reminded. -We ordered several tapas since the waiter pointed out that they were having happy hour specials. They never arrived. -They were busy but the wait was so long for food we eventually ended up trying to find our waiter to see if they had forgotten about our order.  -At long last the food came and we had to remind her we had ordered tapas and we had wanted them before the meal. So we ended up with tapas with our meal which was ideally ordered to go with the drinks.  The falafel platter was a little disappointing as is the case whenever I order it from here. For some reason they always over-fry the balls leaving them too hard. Nothing really beats Haji Baba's or Elie's Deli.

My huge mistake was trusting the reviews from people who only have 1 review for this place and no friends to their name. Screams workers or owner created accounts, because there is no way actual people think this is a great pizza place. However, I did not notice that because I was using the mobile app and it doesn't list that info beside the reviewers name.   We came here hungry from Pop Culture Paradise and instead of going to the old standby's: Chuck Box, Tessio's Pizza, Otto's, or Jaime's Pizza, we wanted to try something new. There was no free parking so we also had to pay $5 for parking.   The doors were wide open with no air conditioning inside, no tables only barstools with a narrow bar table against the wall. There is sitting outside on regular tables but it's too hot outside right now for that.   *Pizza sauce had no flavor *Cheese tasted only mildly like mozzarella which was weird *Onions we got on our pizza were slimy and undercooked, gross *Garlic? what garlic? we ordered it, but the taste of it was to be found nowhere  The only positives was that the pizza was huge and the employees were friendly. The only time in history I threw away pizza leftovers.

This location sells some cosmetics, scored some Donna Karan Delicious 3.4 oz perfume for $5 almost full! Some people get very weird about this place and camp out all day to literally snatch goods off of the stock cart when the employee wheels out new stuff. Not a good look people. Always good selection on housewares and furniture.

The Birthday Cake Batter yogurt is exceptional, especially for 130 calories! Compare that to Cold Stone's 340 calories. Of course Cold Stone's is rich, heavy ice cream that is absolutely delicious, but you can't always afford those calories. This is a great substitute. The process is very simple: Grab a small, medium, or large cup, fill it with whatever ice cream you want, and then top with any array of sinful or healthy toppings. They even have Ghirardelli chocolate syrup. Great, thanks Yogurtini.

You could spend a whole day in the Charleston Antique Mall and still not see everything they have to offer. They have your basic antique genre fare, but since this is Las Vegas, they also have many LV themed items. Looking for Liberace's telephone, or Elvis' toupee?? Well, you just might find it here. Sacrilege I say, Elvis never wore a wig.   The cashiers were very friendly here and the bathrooms were clean. There was only one grumpy booth owner that scolded a couple from touching things in his stall. Other than that, everyone was happy to help and answer questions.

Ooh, a nerlinger's delight. At least that's what I felt when I came into the store to find myself face deep in toys and collectibles. Think toys, games, cosplay items, cards, comics, and ALF keychains! Some items were overpriced based on the individual stall but since it is a swap meet, I am sure you could haggle the price a little. The store was a pretty good size but they told me they are going to be moving in another 8 months or so, as business continues to pick up and they are becoming more popular. So I look forward to that, but everyone seemed friendly and conscientious not to bump into you in those tight places.   I was also informed of tournaments that take place in the seating area in the back, so I may have to come back for that. I saw many things I already have, but also items I didn't even know I wanted. Makes a great place to gift hunt. Saturdays seems to be the time to come for sales, more vendors, and more people watching (if that's your thing).

Super clean and well stocked. This location doesn't seem to be as busy as others I have been to. After going to Last Chance, (and leaving disappointed) I came here and I was happy to actually find new items in good condition! The prices are reasonable of course, in comparison to retail prices at Nordstrom.

I live close by, so thank my lucky stars! I wouldn't mind setting up shop in the gaming area and living out the rest of my days only sleeping, eating, and gaming. The place is totally air conditioned, no windows, has flat screen tv's and consoles, comfy chairs, what more could you ask for? However, since I have a life (is a life without gaming, really a life I want to live??), I can only make it in here sporadically. Don't even get me started on the customer service, which is hands down, the friendliest customer service I have ever experienced this side of the desert, including Las Vegas.   Here we were, chatting up the shop clerk, when lo and behold I find me a copy of Vampire Hunter D. Now I know the game is kinda crappy, but I had to have it for my collection of rarities. Cheaper prices than on Amazon too. So far, this is the only store I know of that stays open so late for all of your gamez (yes, I said GAMEZ) needs.

I think Melia and I had almost the same visit. Hipster central, I felt like as if I had walked into an Urban Outfitters/marathon rest stop. The store was clean, neat, and was organized well with proper signage for everything. I was on a mission..a mission to buy lots of tofu (don't ask), but I could not find it anywhere. It didn't help that it was super busy and this is a smaller location. We found an employee stocking juice and tried to get his attention, but it was more like one of those situations where you can tell someone is deliberately trying to ignore you. He begrudgingly pointed to where it was but it definitely rubbed us the wrong way. The produce was very fresh and stocked beautifully, but the clerk in the meat department had no clue about anything that I was asking. When we checked out, I noticed one of my packages had a huge dent in it, while my partner had to go back and get another, she split our checkout into two transactions even after I told her we were together. I guess she was too busy discussing breaks with another employee. The store is fine but I would not return after these oafish interactions.

There is so much to write about but if you go, remember to order the fries. Wow, is all I can say. They seem to follow the McDonald's method which is to boil the potato in salted water for a few minutes then fry them to a golden brown. Trust me, that salt bath makes all the difference in smell, taste, and texture vs regular cut and fried fries. But here I am going on about the fries when this is a pizza place...   There seemed to have been a large number of locals picking up lunch (always a good sign), and they do sell pizza by the slice. We ordered the Chicago Deep Dish and that baby was piled high with cheese and stewed tomatoes, the works. I have never been so full that they had to roll me out of the restaurant like Veruca Salt in Willy Wonka to have me "dejuiced." Super friendly staff that made me feel welcome, I will always visit when I am in the area.

I feel as if these people are the Hank Hill's of gold buying and gold accessories. If you don't know what that means, let's just say that they run a very honest business. I set up an appointment and they called me to confirm, as well as sent me a text to remind me of my appointment. On the phone they were very pleasant. Once I got there, I was promptly seen and Mary went over everything I had brought to her. While doing so, she told me about everything she was doing while she was doing it. The weighing and testing was all done in front of me. I was actually surprised that the quote she gave me was similar to what I had already figured the value of the gold was going to be.  She also gave me the web address to a recognized site where I could check on the value of the gold since I was not selling that day. She told me to check every day, and when the value went up I could come back to sell and get more money! Who does that? Overall, the appointment took about 15 minutes and was extremely informative. I would definitely return here when I need to get rid of some old pieces. They give you the tools to make an informed decision so you will hopefully return, instead of hassling you .

How could you go wrong with Wetzels Pretzels?  Soft, hand rolled, buttered and salted pretzels made throughout the day. This is the very reason you cannot be on a diet when you go to the mall. Seriously, you may try to play it cool and pretend the delicious smell does not affect you in any way as you stroll pass, but who are we kidding?  I highly recommend the cheese pretzel and Cin-A-Yum. After eating a few of these you will be telling people, "I wash myself with a rag on a stick."

Great place for tactical gear: boots, uniforms, patches, backpacks, vests, etc. However, they have a much smaller selection of camping items and very little survival supplies. The store is more suited towards uniforms and accessories, for the rest I went to Bass Pro Shop.

Awesome pizza that microwaves well the next day. Try the Mega Meat pizza, you'll thank me later. Bacon, Pepperoni, ham, sausage, and meatball. The wings were okay, standard wing fare so it is acceptable, just don't expect wing explosion in your mouth.

Don't waste your time. We came here trying to get a quick bite to eat after a concert and we waited what seemed like several minutes up front despite there were only two tables of customers in the whole restaurant. Finally the hostess shows up with no apology, a look of distaste on her face and I know they knew we were there because the door chimes in the back for them to know they have customers in front. But I gave her my two cents before I left out the door to go to Denny's instead. Did we really expect good service after that? I think not.

I love horrendous food and I love food poisoning too. In case you didn't catch that sarcasm I was referring to what I experienced the other day while eating take-out from Hunan Express. Convenient delivery but that's where the accolades end. I will stick with Mr. Hunan as a quick, tasty take-out option. The lowdown:  *Dumplings are the frozen kind not made with dumpling skin but rather some weird, thick dough and deep fried. It was served on top of tons of white rice. *Kung-Pao shrimp was nothing but a bunch of diced celery, peppers and peanuts in a brown sauce. Few shrimp. Really disgusting. *Egg drop soup was okay but not homemade. *Lo-mein was soggy and a bit skeevy looking.  *Cheap soy sauce that tastes like nothing and teeny egg rolls.  Portions were huge but when the food is gross it is basically pointless, it's like they were trying to disguise how bad the food was by giving us a huge amount. Hey look tons of food! It's like when Homer Simpson kept eating at Doughy's even though it was terrible but was 2 for 1.

This is the closest location to my house, otherwise I might frequent the Thunderbird location more. Something about the seedy characters, and jumbled organization that adds to the record store experience. I don't know. The Mill location is a very clean, well organized store, with very friendly customer service. If they don't have something in stock, they will call around to other locations to locate it for you.   As usual, they have bins and bins of books on sale. 5 books for $2?? Yes please!  DVDs priced similarly too. Now you may be thinking, aw big deal, a bunch of generic movies and books that have been sitting there for a year that no one wants. Well, you are good to be skeptical kemo sabe. I actually had to come to Zia's on a daily basis recently and I found that they refresh their selection quite often, and you can actually find many recognizable movies and books. Also, they have a pretty good selection of Criterion Collection movies (however, not on sale but you can use the 20% coupon you get by signing up on their website).   Also, a great place to come for those last minute, "aw what the hell do I buy for so and so's birthday??!" You can find books, movies, and music for one, but also pop culture items, and those oh so important toupee headphones. You can also get custom screened t-shirts printed here that I don't believe I have seen at any other Zia's.

Holy bins Batman!! We stopped in here to see what this store was about after the grand opening. Let's just say if you need to buy something in bulk, or out of a bin, this is your place to go. They had everything from beans, to sliced dried pineapple, and coffee beans. The employees were pretty friendly. Looking around the store, it seems to be like a mini Costco based on the selection and shelving. The store is huge so maybe coming during the afternoon is not your best bet to navigate the store, or if you detest large crowds of people. The aisles were appropriately spaced and the store was super clean.   An important note is that they do not accept credit cards! So no collecting points from shopping here. Debit or cash only.

I too, like the others was more than disappointed upon entering the store. They had a lady at the stoplight advertising the shop so I thought I'd stop in. It is housed in an old strip mall location surrounded by daycare centers and a Big Lots.   The place was so disorganized and there was this horrible urine smell all over the store. I still made a point to really try to look at things but their pricing was terrible as well. As I looked at the dresses, I noticed that many, if not all of them were priced at $15. There were moderate looking garments that Goodwill would probably price at around $8. I go to thrift stores so extremely often, I have the pricing down to a science. Many of their shoes were also priced high, with a pair of sad pumps priced at $18.   I would like to return to this location once they have all the kinks worked out. For now, the store was too messy, smelly, and overpriced for me to return.

Very clean and well organized. This location is smaller than the more larger Goodwill's but they seemed to have a little of everything. The furniture and housewares section is small but come here if you are looking for clothing, they have a large selection.

The service was friendly enough but honestly the coffee tasted so watered down I thought it might have been a mistake. There was no rich, roasted flavors there and it was not fresh. I ordered a house coffee and a caramel macchiato iced coffee. The iced coffee wasn't any better sadly, it actually tasted like dirt! The iced coffee was not cold as well, with a few ice cubes floating on the top watering it down even more. I also ordered ice cream but it was just pretty standard ice cream in a tub, nothing special. The place looked cozy enough, but I won't be returning. I threw the coffee away after a few sips, it was that bad.

I was here looking for a Christmas tree at Vertuccio Farms, and when I came out, I noticed this little coffee shack. It's a cute little shack right on Vertuccio's property in the front of the farm as you come in. At first I had reservations, would their idea of coffee be a milkshake or sugar flavored water with a little bit of coffee flavor as so many coffee shops do here in AZ? I ordered two salted caramel lattes and they were so good. The guy running the shop was very enthusiastic and friendly, almost too hyper, but I view this as a good thing. The lattes were good and they had this awesome salted caramel drizzled all over the whipped cream. Not too sugary, and just right. Just like Goldilocks would have wanted.   So there you have it. Come for the Christmas trees, stay for the coffee.

Super friendly service at this location, and someone mentioned to sign up for their rewards card and you can print out coupons in the store. There is a machine where you can scan your card and you can print them out there! CVS is largely more expensive than Walgreens, but I think they have a much better selection on their items and they carry a wider variety of items. Instead of the two sad aisles at Walgreens, their food selection is more like a mini mart. The Pharmacy is pretty good at this location too.

Located inside Lee Lee Oriental Supermarket, J. Fortune Bakery sits next to the produce and baked goods section. They make a number of steamed buns, cakes, breads, and pastries Asian style. The wedding cakes looked gorgeous. The woman in front was very helpful with my selection of goods to take home. I love green tea buns, bbq and savory buns, and red bean paste buns. These are so good and they had each and every one that they make by hand. She suggested a rolled green tea cake, which I thought was going to be a bit much but when I got it home, it was so light and creamy. It was filled with a green tea whipped cream. Yum.   I ordered steamed chicken buns and the bbq buns, which were moist, soft, and had very light but good flavors. The red bean paste buns were more dense and had a great sweet red bean flavor. The prices were pretty reasonable as well, I had a small bag filled with goodies for $12. A definite must stop whenever I am at Lee Lee's! Also, ask for a discount card. After you collect 10 stamps, you get a $10 free reward. I am not sure about the expiration date, so you will have to ask.

Pretty nice staff and don't forget your 20% off coupon! You can save a lot with one of those things and they usually don't take it away after you use it, or they give you another one after your transaction. This is not the best location (that one is on Thunderbird), but they seemed to have a nice selection. Sure, you could stay home and buy your media online but where's the fun in that?

Super new location that opened at the beginning of the year I believe, next to the 99 Cents Only store and Walmart. We joked on the way in that this experience was either going to be really bad or really good because it was so new. Of course if you have been to a Culver's, the inside was the same as any location: plenty of family style seating and booths. Everything came out hot and was fresh. The hamburgers are always pounded thin, it's actually real beef, and the cheese is amazing. The fries are crinkle cut and they taste fresh.   The only thing I have ever eaten at Culver's that I was disappointed by was the mashed potatoes and gravy, the gravy was on the flavorless side. Other than that, everything is GOOD here. Those concrete mixers will get you into trouble, they are so good but so many calories. The diet root beer tastes like regular. If you've ever had root beer from a keg, that's what it tasted like.  Even though it is fast food, they actually bring your food to your table and ask if you need anything else.

*&$% you Discount Crab. I have been a loyal customer to Sunrise Cab for about 5 years now and they have never let me down. Sometimes I wish they would get there a little more quicker but they will always give you a call when they are on their way and help you out with any bags you might have. I was giving 40-50 bucks to Discount Cab every other week until I learned about Sunrise. So my bill went from 40-50 bucks down to $30 bucks or sometime under. The drivers never give you an attitude if you want them to drive you YOUR way unlike the drivers for Discount.   One driver I had from Discount cab went the long way one time purposely to make more money because I did not know the directions exactly. Well I made sure that did not happen again and had I directions the next time and did not use them anymore. A lot of drivers I talked to either used to work for Discount or came from a big city. Some of the cars can be old, like 1980's old but they are getting new cars, the fleet they have now used to be police cars. Bud is always great when I call him although he can curt sometimes but that's just his way. He always helped me when I was in some tight spots before.   They only service Phoenix-mostly the metro area but they will come pick you up if they are driving you out to Chandler or to some other boonie location. Just let them know ahead of time that way you can save some money on your return trip. They will drive you out far from Phoenix because that is worthwhile for them to make the trip.
