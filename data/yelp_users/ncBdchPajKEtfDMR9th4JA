Horrible customer service! Sales staff needs training and management is never on site.  The store shelves are always empty and never have the product in stock.  Sales items are never displayed out on time.  If you have a sale on your products you need to be stocked and ready for the customer when the stores opens.  Opening the boxing during the sales and not being organized is NOT good customer service.  I shouldn't have to ask for products that is listed in flyer.  I am shocked that sales staff doesn't know what is on sale.  I don't like seeing tables at the front of store with huge signage  - $12.99 for shampoo - go to the counter to pay for it and it's ring up for $15.99.  The cashier tells me I'm sorry but they have the wrong product on the table and they have charge me the higher price.  Came back to the store the next day and they never fixed the table with the wrong product. This store needs help!   Don't even get me started with Ulta Hair Salon.  The stylists can't keep their the appointments they book.  Always calling in sick. Stations are dirty. Nothing like waiting for the stylist to show up for your appointment and 20 minutes goes by and a sales associate tells you - your stylist called in sick.  This location needs a kick in the ass and additional training.

WOW!  What a great little store in Chandler.  I feel inspired every time I leave the shop. LOVE the employees because they're so helpful. I took a class and the instructors were great. Green Table Gift store is a must see for anyone who really enjoys adorable gift ideas.

Love the food but hate the service.  The service employees preparing the food are to busy socializing with each other instead of paying attention to customer.  I had to repeat my order 5 times before they got it right.  The staff needs to slow down, give eye contact to the customer and quit talking to each other about who is dating who.....what their plans are later tonight....and stop bitching to each other about who is not working their stations.  Bad customer service!!!
