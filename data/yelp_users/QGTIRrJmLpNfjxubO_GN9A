I was taken to Honey Bears BBQ by a co-worker for lunch and oh am I glad I learned about this place! We went this location by the airport, but I imagine they are all just as tasty. I got the 3 slider plate with a side of macaroni and cheese. We got it to go and the sauce (a very large portion) comes on the side. YUM! I'm a smaller girl but I can eat and this lasted me lunch and dinner - the leftovers were just as amazing. Can't wait to go back! :)

First time at Fancy today. Walk-in appointment and I got sat immediately with Ha. She was very good! Very clean and quick technique. The salon is very nice and welcoming...they offer coffee, water, etc. I recently moved to the area and will definitely be back!!

Went for Saturday happy hour last night and left with a happy tummy! How can you beat sushi happy hour on Saturday until 7!! :)  *****  Large Kirin Light for $5 (always good :) *****  Salmon Carpaccio (amazing and a great kick of wasabi) *****  Sushi (all was fantastic...got salmon, tuna, and yellowtail) *****  Pineapple Cream Cheese Won-Tons (yummy!!) ***     Viva Las Vegas Roll (Unique, but not for my taste) **       Crispy Spicy Tuna (soo hard to chew! Rice was not crispy, just tough and chewy)

Great Taco Tuesday!!  Love the $2 crunchy fish tacos!! Sometimes hard to get a seat outside and the inside just isn't the same :)

The boyfriend and I went for a UFC this past weekend. No UFC cover which is always nice. Nice, large outdoor patio with good TV's (sound could've been louder). Good atmosphere with firepit and a giant Jenga game!  We'll be back!

Gorgeous hotel. We went for "Yappy Hour" last month and it was a fun experience. Yappy Hour is held the last Thursday of the month - for $10 you get you bring your dog, get a glass of wine, and proceeds go to the Humane Society....good time, we'll be back!   From their facebook page: "Grab your dog(s) and head down to Crave tonight for Yappy Hour from 4-7. Entrance is $10 and includes a glass of wine and plenty of treats and water for your dog. Half of the proceeds from each Yappy Hour go to benefit the Arizona Humane Society"

3 of us went for Saturday lunch. "Skinny Chick" lunch special is ANY salad and light beer for $8. No * by the special indicating fine print. But they charged me $2 for the chicken in my BBQ CHICKEN chop salad. Obviously $2 isn't much, but it's the principle and was just extra annoying after the already poor service!  * One of us asked for no mayo or cheese on a burger. Got both * One of us asked for an American Burger with turkey patty. Got a beef patty. * However, my BBQ chicken chop salad was yummy! Even if they did charge me $2 more for chicken...  Will return for drinks, not food

I just had my 4th hair appointment with Rick (the owner)...and it's about time I leave a 5-star review!! I moved to Scottsdale from Orange County in July and was super nervous about finding a new hair stylist to give me the blonde I desired. R Salon is near my work in the Biltmore area and after driving by the sidewalk sign a few times I Yelped it...of course! Boy am I glad I found R Salon!  My first time visit was 50% off with a Yelp special with made my decision to go there even easier. The salon is super trendy and cute inside, but that's hard to tell from the outside. The receptionists are always friendly and they have yummy lemonade and beverages which they offer you right away.  As for my actual hair - Rick is truly an artist when it comes to hair. Rick is a painter and hair is his canvas...how awesomely corny is that :) Corny, yet very true. Getting the "right blonde" is not easy, but he does it perfectly!  Also, on a different note, if you want to chat he'll chat with you and if you just want to read or relax that's fine too.  I highly recommend, not only Rick, but R Salon overall!

I love AZ Alterations! When you're 5'1" it's important to find a seamstress you trust! Ive been coming here for 3 years and I highly recommend! I've done bridesmaid dresses alterations, jean and pant hemming and jean patches. Always happy with their results and speed.

Yum!! They give you two samples before you order. Don't me dumb like me and accidentally try a non-alcohol-infused...that's the point of Lee's right? :) I had a scoop of the Chocolate Stout and loved it. Lost a star because the customer service could use a little work, felt like we were annoying the employee which is never a welcome feeling.

Wasn't impressed....my first time at Five Guys and not sure if it was the chain overall or the location. Service was good, so I'm thinking I'm just an In N Out girl? Ordered a bacon cheeseburger, fries, and drink. Burger was just ok (way too big for me with the double patty, but I thought it'd be a single), fries were not good...just too expensive for what I got

Loved it! Their use of Groupon marketing has paid off because I'll be back every time I fly! Very friendly staff. Amazing customer service! Parking lot feels very safe. Pick up and drop off right at your car space. Easy and smooth experience. Highly recommend!!  Tip: the "covered parking" is only an overhead covering not underground or anything so if I were paying full price I think uncovered would be just fine

I've been going to Urban Wax for over a year so it's about time for a review! I drive from North Scottsdale because I love it so much. The entire staff is friendly and professional. My normal waxer (Alissa) just left but I've most recently gone to Kiana and she was fantastic. I bought a package and it's well worth it, breaking down to around $30/wax which is great!   I've also done a few custom spray tans here and am always very happy. I ended up buying this package as well which breaks down to only $25/tan!  So excited for their 2nd location to open up north!
