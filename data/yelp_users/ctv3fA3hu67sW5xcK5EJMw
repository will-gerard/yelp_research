I have never needed to go to a heart specialist before, but all I can say is that i'm VERY impressed with the warmth I have received by the staff and doctors here, especially considering how busy they are.  The waiting room may be packed, but you still receive a friendly smile, and you still see your doctor at the scheduled time.  I needed an Echo done of my heart, and all the staff were very personable, and down to earth.  Dr. Cherukuri was my specialist, and I have not met a doctor who was so humble and kind in a VERY LONG time.  I recommend this place to anyone.

Gollo Burro, Machaca Taco, and Tostada, and make sure you order the "Extra Hot" Sauce!!!  If you don't like this place, you're not from around here, that's for sure.  It's definitely not for your average gringo.  This was the first restaurant that I ever went to as a child, and we kept going back because you can have screaming kids, and no one gets on your case about it.  This is truly a family restaurant beyond all family restaurants!    Great atmosphere, great margaritas, great food.

If you have never been, you haven't lived!  Anything you get is amazing, all the ingredients are local and fresh.

This is a great indoor stadium, but the prices have always been ridiculous.  Beers, hotdogs, ice cream, all of it.  However, so is any sporting event these days, and for any stadium i've ever been to, I would say Chase Field is definitely one of the more comfortable.

Just ate there last night with my girlfriend, and it was AWESOME!!!  The braised short rib flakes off as you push down with your fork, the cocktails are great, and even their take on a fish taco has its own novel nuances.

I absolutely love this place.  There isn't a single menu item I have ever had that was bad, the people working there are friendly, and though the parking is scarce, there's valet if it gets really bad.    Do yourself a favor and just go if you've never been, you won't be disappointed.

If you have never had a pasty before in your life, you need to ask yourself what your problem is, and get down the the Cornish Pasty Company, ASAP!!!!!  I'm not going to go further, just go, find the one that looks best to you, and get it, you will NOT be disappointed!  Not to mention they have Hoegaarden on draft!!!

I've only had the meatball sub and the italian sub, but both of them knock the socks off the competition.  If you've never been here, you should just go and experience it for yourself!

I eat sushi about 2 days a week, and I had never been to Geisha A Go Go.  I was very intrigued, i would think something in Scottsdale in this neighborhood has to be of substance, or how else would they pay the bills, right?   IT WAS MUD BUTT AT FIRST BITE...   If you're gonna take a dump here, which I assume you will if you eat the food, I highly advise HOVERING, not even a nest of TP will save you from the potential staph infection you could catch from those toilette seats.  I was trying to have a decent conversation with my company, but the 40-something year-old patrons there seem to think that yelling is the only way you can communicate at a restaurant.  If you wanna listen to dudes talk about how Poison and The Scorpions are great "hard rock" bands, this place is for YOU.    If someone is rating this place 5-stars, it's because they are getting payed to, or have never had sushi near a large body of salt water, and are land-locked in the misery we know as Scottsdale.  The staff were amazing, very polite and kind.  Hence the generosity on two stars.

Not gonna lie, this place is pretty awesome.  I'm sure there may be something on the menu that doesn't meet the 5-star criteria, but personally, I had a braised short rib and avocado cheese crisp with a couple of grey hounds, and that was delicious!  The chips are a step above MANY and MOST other restaurants and the salsa and guacamole is simply superb.  If you are disappointed, you are either a snob, or you got bad service.  Our waiter was great, and had plenty of patience for how annoying we probably seemed. ;)

When it comes to flavor, you can't beat Lo-Lo's in comparison to the others.  Some of the staff are cordial and interact, some...not so much, but everyone working there is having a good time.    I got the Number 1, washed it down with blue Kool-Aid and it was awesome.  My chick got the Betty Boop, and we were both very happy.  I don't typically choose to eat food that has been fried, but i'll make the exception for Lo-Lo's.

I have tried to hold off on giving a review like this, but the Hillside Spot makes great food and has consistently the worst service I have ever been given.  Two days ago, my friend and I sat down, and were greeted fairly quickly by our waiter, he took our drink orders, quickly came back with what we had ordered, and then left us there for 10 minutes while he tinkered around the bar area, and conversed with his colleagues.  It wasn't until we left the patio and got in our cars until anyone had even recognized we were leaving (or maybe they forgot we were even out there, idk), we left enough money to pay for our drinks and peaced out.    Two months ago, I was there with a friend of mine, and her father.  At the end of our meal he requested some coffee (which is something MANY people drink after dinner), and the waiter informed us that they weren't serving coffee anymore because he had already turned the coffee pot off.  (Keep in mind, the restaurant was open for another hour, AND there is a full espresso bar there)  My friend's father asked if he would really in truly prefer having a customer go to the gas station across the street for coffee, and the terse response he got was, "You can go anywhere you want for coffee, you are just not getting it here."  The only reasoning I could have had at the time was that it was because my friend's father is South African, and they just don't like dealing with tourists, but after the other night, it's official, THIS PLACE HAS THE WORST SERVICE EVER.  These people need to understand who gives them a job, whether or not the company as a whole is treating their staff like crap, and they're all disgruntled, i'm not sure, but they were definitely not overworked either time that I went in recently and received terrible service.  Their Flaco Torta is great, but that's why I gave them two stars.

This place is pretty gooooood.  I think the meatloaf is still my favorite by far, but the best part is imbibing on too many cocktails.

There's something for everyone, there are alternatives like quinoa pasta for those with gluten intolerances, and they even ask if it is for allergy purposes, just to make sure you don't consume anything else that contains gluten.  Baked Rigatony with chicken or sausage, or both will knock your socks off.  The pizza is great, the artichoke chicken.  All of it!!!!

I have eaten here from time to time for over a year and a half now, and I am always amazed with at least ONE of the items I order.  The hard part is consistency of menu items for me.    I had the Sweet Potato and Black Bean tacos... they were OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!  Unfortunately, the ceviche that i'm accustomed to from them is usually served in a giant bowl with beet chips and a variety of other fixings, which is NOT what I received, and it was definitely a bummer.    If you've never been, you should definitely go, and if you are only looking for cocktails, I had a watermelon margerita, and a blackberry-ginger margerita yesterday that puts their competition to shame.  Go check it out!!!

This place was cool!    The bummer is I got a skin infection from the laser tag.  I will say right now, I doubt i'll go back, and i'm probably only one of a few.  It still had to be said though, my trip to the ER wasn't worth being quiet about.
