I wish I liked this place as it is close to home and has a good hh. The food though has yet to impress. We've given it a handful of tries as we really wanted to like this place but unfortunately we have left sick to our stomach's and regretful. The food is really greasy and lacks flavor.

This a PARKING review only! It used to be a flat $15/week Parking rate. Effective December 1st it's now $10/day. So not worth it. Can park cheaper at Blue Sky and in economy lots at the airport which have much better service and run all the time.

The pizza was great and cheap! I'm used to spending $12+ on flat bread pizzas so was pleasantly surprised to see them for under $10. The wine was affordable and the service was great. Definitely worth the visit.

Excellent meal and experience! I went here for dinner last night and truly had a wonderful time. The food was excellent and the atmosphere was very romantic and relaxed. Christopher, the Chef & Owner, was also the server, bus boy, host and manager. He did it all and did it perfectly.   When I made the reservation he called me back to find out what kind of food we preferred and to find out if we had any food allergies. I told him seafood and beef and that we weren't picky eaters. He had a delicious shrimp and asparagus dish for me and a pork tenderloin in a beef and smoked chipotle bbq sauce for my boyfriend. Both were excellent! He even asked me what herbs I liked to prepare my shrimp entree with. Never been asked that before!  Our reservations was at 7:30pm and we didn't leave until 10pm. It was a long and very nice evening. The price for a three course dinner was $40pp and then $10 for the corkage fee. I don't know where else you can get a meal of this quality for the price.   It is officially one of my favorite restaurant's in the Valley and can't wait to return. Next time will be for the brunch I keep reading about. It'll be the perfect way to spend a Saturday afternoon.

Tuck Shop is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Phx. Everything is superb from the service to drinks to food to overall experience. Definitely go soon!

We went to dinner here last night for the 4th or 5th time and had a great meal. We always buy the Restaurant.com coupon for Jasper's which makes it quite the affordable date night.   It is small but cute has great food. I had the JACKRice last night which was excellent. My bf had the meatloaf sandwich and fries which was also pretty amazing. We started with the Shrimp Caprese which was small but still really good. The server dropped one of our plates so we got free dessert as well. We had the strawberry-rubarb cobbler which was really good.   I highly recommend this place and definitely think it's worth the drive.

Such a great experience. My budget was under $2k and they have an entire room dedicated to dresses in that price range. I didn't even have to look at anything over my budget which was a huge relief.  My consultant selected all my dresses for me to try on based on my "vision." She was great and was not pushy at all. I fell in love with two and am happy to say that I chose the perfect dress. Wonderful selection and overall experience!

Excellent dining experience. Very random that the restaurant is located in the gift shop of a salon, but once you take a bite of the food you really don't even notice or care. The Chef cooks in an open kitchen which I love and the server was great. My bf ordered the 5 courses and I ordered 4. It was perfect for the two of us. We split everything so got to try a good majority of the menu. We loved it all! Definitely check it out soon!

Oh Mabel's how you have failed me. We were regulars here. Well, not regulars exactly, but monthly patrons. This last time was a joke! It was a Friday night and we chose to sit outside. Bad mistake! We ordered drinks and food but the food never made it to the table. We got our drinks, waited an hour and still no food. Server told us to wait when we were clearly annoyed and ready to leave to get dinner. 5min later the so called manager came up, again as we were literally leaving, and apologized for the wait. Offered to pay for food but came back out 5min later to say it wasn't ready yet... Two stars is gracious as I do like the cocktails. Service however is awful! Maybe just don't sit outdoor as clearly you will be forgotten.

Kathy did the alterations on my pretty intricate lace wedding dress and was wonderful to work with. She was very friendly, patient, knowledge and great at her craft. She took her time with each appointment to ensure the dress was perfect. The final product was stunning and I couldn't be happier. Thanks Kathy!

I come here often as it's close to home and there aren't many good happy hours that go past 6pm. Sadly since the new ownership the food has gone downhill. Green chili pork is nothing like it used to be and flatbread is sadly awful. I will continue to come for hh though and hope the food gets back to the quality it used to be.

Found this gem of a restaurant on restaurant.com and read the few yelp reviews before we decided to check it out. We were more then pleasantly surprised.  They greeted us with complimentary miso soup and salad which was a nice first impression. They have a great variety of sushi rolls as well as Korean menu. We decided on two rolls and two entrees and we loved it all. The sushi is probably some of the best fish I've had in the valley. I haven't had fish that melts in your mouth since San Fran to be honest.  Definitely check this place soon!!

This is my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale. Been dozens of times and never disappointed. The happy hour is a great deal, the cocktails are delicious and creative and the food is excellent. The prices for food aren't bad either. If you haven't been before then you are missing out!

I really liked this place and am happy to have found a new place close to home. We went for happy hour and enjoyed their cocktails and wine. Best of all hh is daily from 3-6.  I can't wait to go back.

Love this place! Amazing wood fired pizza at an affordable price. We've eaten in the restaurant 4-times and have always had great service. We also order out and they wait for you to get there to fire up the pizzas. It's a must try!!

An Arcadia restaurant feel in South Scottsdale. Finally! Happy hour is only $1 off f&b which isn't all that great but we still enjoyed. The cocktails were good and food was also reasonably priced and tasty. Will definitely be back.

I can't believe I am just now writing a review for this place as it has been a staple in our diet for the last two years. We love The Blind Pig as the food is always delicious and really affordable.   It's not your typical Mexican restaurant as everything is really fresh and never greasy. The staff is great as well and always remember us. I highly recommend the short rib tacos with green salsa, ceviche, shrimp tamale and mushroom quesadilla. They have enchiladas on special sometimes and are always amazing. Not to mention they have top shelf margaritas and Paloma's for $7 all the time.   It is a must try.

Sarah is amazing and I couldn't be happier that I chose her for our September wedding. She listened to my vision and exceeded by expectations. The flowers lasted for 6 days after our wedding which was a great surprise. She worked within my budget and was responsive. Definitely recommend to anyone. Thanks Sarah!!

We love Sip! It's super cute, has great coffee drinks, beer and cocktails. Not to mention they have a dog friendly patio. What more could a girl ask for.  I'd give them 5 Stars but have yet to be impressed with the food. We've only tried a couple sandwiches and they were small and nothing special for the price. We still frequent Sip for an afternoon drink and atmosphere.

We had the most amazing meal here last night and can't wait to go back! We splurged and got the 4-course tasting menu and everything came out perfectly. I had the most amazing cod and am sad it's going to be taken off the menu soon as they change the menu every 6 to 8 weeks. Sometimes I find myself hungry after getting a tasting menu but last night was more than enough food.   The service was great as well as the atmosphere and the cocktails were top notch. I do agree with some other posts stating it's a three dollar sign restaurant and not a two but it was definitely worth it.   Happy to say I have a new favorite in town!

Been here twice now and a fan. Went for dinner the first time and food was great. Service was slow but it was like week 3 so I can't be negative about that.   Went for hh last week and really likes it. Great drinks, wine and food specials till 7pm. No complaints at all. Might be our new  go to hh place.

We went again last night and it was as good as the first time. The veal Marsala was hands down the best we've ever tasted. It's no longer byob as they got their liquor license. Kind of a bummer as I love byob's but drinks are reasonably priced.

The Upton is a really cute that has a good vibe and great patio seating. Our server was a bit quirky but it made our experience entertaining. The Manager was really nice and gave us a voucher for two free drinks on our next visit cause the service was a little slow.   We ordered the ribs which were a bit overdone but the sauce was still good. We then ordered the fried chicken and the pork tacos.  I thought the chicken was good but kind of bland compared to some other places that I've had it. The tacos hit the spot though.   We tried a few of their craft cocktails and were quite impressed.   All in all we liked The Upton and definitely plan to come back very soon!

I'm hesitant to write this as I get they opened less then a month ago but I feel I owe people a time waster. I'm annoyed I spent close to two hours of my Tuesday night here tonight.    The restaurant looks and feels like a Scottsdale club which is odd as they're advertising as a wine bar. We almost didn't go in but since we were already there we decided to give it a shot. They have a tiny bar, a DJ booth and a small amount of tables. Again, odd for a wine bar... They had 3 ppl behind the bar, one manager in a suit, one server and another guy in a red hoodie who I'm assuming is an owner cause he was walking around all night. The poor server was running with a large party and two other tables while everyone else seemed to be standing around oblivious to their surroundings. We watched as a table walked out after not being greeted for more than 10 minutes cause the server was figuring out the computer system. It was as if the manager and hoodie were above greeting their guests.   Anyway, about the actual food. It took over 45-min to get our food which came out hot and rather tasty. We had the wings which were nice and meaty and two panini's. This sandwiches were good but nothing I'd come back for but they were a great deal as it was buy one drink get one free panini.   Don't plan on returning unfortunately although I was excited about a new "wine bar" in town.

My new obsession for lunch! We go to Hawaii annually and I eat poke almost day. Now I can finally have it and close to home!   Fish was fresh and the toppings were also great. I did a large bowl so I could try 3 types of fish. I had the salmon, tuna and yellowtail. All were great. The seaweed salad and crab salad are free toppings which I loved.   It's a great concept and I'm looking forward to my next visit.
