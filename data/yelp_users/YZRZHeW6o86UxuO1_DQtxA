Aside from the moody girls that work there, the food at this location just didn't hit the spot. I guess the customer service took away my hunger. Oh well, I guess they don't know that it's better to shake that booty than to be moody.

Lux regular. Yeah it can seem vey hipster or pretentious but if you're brave enough to tread the super hip hipsters and break a little awkward sweat for $2 endless refills for the dark or light roast then you have made it my friend.

CASH OR EBT CARD ONLY...!! So, the pastries are moderately sized but not too big and most are reasonably priced at .75 cents or so. Went for the first time today and the cute little lady behind the counter named Rocio was very kind and helpful. The pastries are also very delicious and crisp and there's a varied selection so it's hard to choose!
