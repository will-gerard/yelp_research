What happened to this place? I used to go here quite often, but I am thinking twice before returning. I waited to update this review until I had 3 negative experiences because I wanted to give Zoe's the benefit of the doubt, but things have not improved. First off, there has been water covering the floor of the left side of the restaurant the past 3 times I have been there. I think they have a leaky roof, but it has been weeks, maybe even months, and there is still water. This is hazardous and just plain disgusting. Also, the restaurant is just dirty. I had to ask to have 2 different tables wiped down, and the crumbs from the table were wiped onto the chairs. There were 5 of us in for lunch last week, and every chair was covered in crumbs from the previous diners. So gross! I am sad this place has gone downhill; Zoe's has always been a staple for my friends and me, and now we will have to find a replacement.

The reason I Yelp is for entertainment and because I use the reviews from others to choose where I spend my money, so I like doing my part by sharing my own experiences. My intention is not to get free stuff. Ever. I rarely write negative reviews, and the reason I wrote a negative review for Zoe's was because I believe the conditions of the restaurant were a health risk. That being said, here is my update. So one of the managers from Zoe's asks for my phone number so he can find out more information. I give it to him, willing to share my experience. He calls me, hears me out, and apologizes. Then he asks for my address so he can send me a gift certificate. Unnecessary, I tell him, but nice touch. So I give him my address. Now, 2 weeks later, nothing. I messaged the customer service person who had contacted me initially just to let her know the gift card had not arrived. Just pretty surprising the level of poor management. I am no longer wondering what happen to Zoe's because it is pretty self evident.

Dive bar-Check! Cold beer-Check! Pool, darts, and other fun bar games-Check! If you are looking for a friendly atmosphere and a great place to gather, this is the place. There is nothing hoity toity about this place. I sponsored an event here last week with my co-workers, thirsty teachers, and HB's delivered. Service was fast and friendly. Happy hour prices were a plus. We will definitely return!

I give this place one star, begrudgingly. The only good thing about this place was the ambiance and the service at the bar. I am appalled by the service we had at the table. I have never been treated so badly. We had a party of 6, and we chose a table on the patio. The patio was really cool and full of party goers, mostly large groups of people. We sat for about an hour and a half without a server, so we got our drinks from the bar.  No big deal.Finally we decided we wanted some food, so a member of our group flagged down a waitress. Big mistake! The server, Cindy, was the WORST! She was so rude. She explained that no one knew whose table ours was, so no one waited on us. My sister tried to order and she snapped at her, "I am waiting until everyone is ready to order!" I suggested maybe we should order from the bar and then she snapped at me, "You cannot order from the bar! You have to order from me." We ordered our food and, after several eye rolls, Cindy left our table. I seriously should have talked to a manager because she was so rude to our party. She continually rolled her eyes when we ordered drinks. The food came and it was awful. I ordered the shrimp tacos. They were completely dry and almost inedible.  I will never go back to this establishment. I cannot believe the treatment we received. This woman should not be in the service industry. I would think, in this economy, there are plenty if servers who would have wanted to wait on a party like ours. We spent $200 at table, not even counting the drinks we got at the bar. We are all upper middle class people; there was no reason Cindy would have thought we would not have tipped her well. I always give servers the benefit of the doubt; I was a server for 10 years, so I understand they have bad days. But this behavior was inexcusable and shocking. Cindy was the rudest server I have EVER had. I cannot even explain it in words. It wasn't what she said, it was the condescending tone, eye rolling, and abrupt responses.

Amazing restaurant!! I will admit, I was a little skeptical when I looked at the menu. Nothing really jumped out at me, and I thought this might be more of a tourist trap. I was pleasantly surprised by is place! We took our in laws and aunt and uncle to this place after they had driven across country to snow bird. Needless to say, they were ready for a delicious meal. The wait staff was friendly, but a bit slow, hence the 4 instead of 5 stars. My in-laws took their time perusing the wine menu, but we did not receive the dinner menu until after our bottle of wine was presented by the sommelier. He was an interesting gentleman with a great sense of humor. He was definitely the highlight of our evening service wise.     Once we ordered, after about 20 minutes after we were seated, the food arrived promptly. First we received the most awesome bread, pesto dip, and goat cheese dip. YUMMY!! Then our appetizers arrived. We ordered pork belly and scallops. The scallops were served with a coleslaw and a citrus-like sauce. Our meals were little pieces of heaven. I ordered the lobster and pancetta wrapped prawns. It was served with a rice cake. OMG the best meal ever. My hubby ordered a filet and it was perfectly cooked. My inlaws had the halibut which was my least favorite of the meals, but still excellent.       This place is not cheap, so be prepared to spend a pretty penny.. However, it is really great food and worth every penny!! The view is phenomenal; the city looks serene and calm from high above!

The best pizza I have had in a long time. I give it 4 stars because the area it is in is hard to find and somewhat shady. We ordered a pineapple, bacon, feta pizza. Even though it took me a while to find this place (my fault. Forgot phone and had to return home to Mapquest), the crust was crisp and the pizza was perfect! 5 stars if you open a location further north or expand ur delivery area.

I feel like i give too many 5 star reviews, so heres a 4 star. This place rocks! Our server, named Leah, was great. We had refills before asking, cold beer, and plenty if yummy food. My only 2 complaints are-the tables are so close together, another waitress kept walking through, and I had to move every time. Also, the food is bar food. I know it is a bar, and the food was good, but there wasn't much for someone who wants healthy fare. I had a french dip, with a salad which was excellent. We will definitely be back, wearing our brown and orange--go Browns!!

Perfect for the evening out with my husband without the bebe'. Cheap pitchers of decent beer, fun jukebox, and the cheapest pool I have ever seen. A place to go to disappear or make new friends. Strange enough, both fit. Cool spot!

Nice local place. My husband eats to go from here at least once a week. Today we went there, together, for lunch. I had a yummy antipasta salad with the BEST house Italian dressing. The oil and vinegar, not the creamy. The salad was huge and we could have split it between the two of us, and that was the small.  Ben had the spaghetti, which was good, too. Server was super friendly and efficient. I am glad we have a close option for homemade food.

After having to pay last, year, I convinced hubby to take our taxes to a professional, and I am happy we did! When I walked into the office, I could tell this was a family business that I could trust. There are pictures of the Hacker family throughout the office, which is a good sign for soon to be parents like us. Bobby Hacker was thorough, but he also completed our taxes quickly. it was a pleasure to be in his office; this was a nice change from previous years trying to follow Turbo Tax directions and failing miserably! In this time of skepticism, especially with identity theft concerns, we felt completely comfortable sharing our information with Bobby. We are actually getting money back for the first time ever! Bobby is friendly and professional. I highly recommend Hacker Accounting. It was easy and so work the expense.

Burgers do not get better than this! My hubby and I stopped by at 11 am today for lunch. We ordered 2 specialty burger combos. Loved being able to see our fresh food cooking. Ambiance is lacking, however, which accounts for the 4 instead if 5 stars. The dining room is not connected, so it seems kinda strange. Fries are not the best I have ever had, but the burgers are the best!

This place is in the wrong place for most people. Located in a dilapidated plaza near the Metro Mall, this restaurant should not be amazing. But it just is. And it is in the perfect spot for us. We have eaten here several times and have never been disappointed in any meal. The inside of the restaurant is not pretty. It resembles a fast food joint. The food is anything but "fast food" quality! Tonight we ordered carry out . The meals are served with chips, salsa, and refried bean dip, which is outstanding. We ordered the shrimp wrapped with bacon, which is served with refried beans, rice, and a small salad. YUM! It is definitely in the top 5 best Mexican dishes I have ever had. My hubby had the green pork burrito. It is huge! Also served with beans and rice. We love this place and hope people go there so it stays in business unlike most of the restaurants and stores located in and around Metro Center.

Really great place! We used to frequent the location in Mesa, but the manager was a total witch! I am serious--my bf, at the time, and I would go there, weekly, and she would never acknowledge us, or even attempt to be polite to the customers, so we stopped going. I am glad we gave the Bell Rd. location a try. The service was excellent! We were greeted, with a big smile, and seated immediately. Our server was excellent. Food is great. We always order the same thing, a skillet for me and Eye Opener Combo for the hubster. We are definitely excited to welcome this franchise back in to our rotation of wonderful breakfast joints!

My husband's job rocks! Not only do we get to stay in fancy hotels, we get free tix for cool events. Not to be a snob, but I can't see us spending money going to the Ren Fair. But, because we went for free, I now see the attraction. Yes, there are peole dressed up in Renny outfits and way too much old lady cleavage. But we had a lot of fun! The performances were interesting and entertaining. The food was awesome. If you haven't had a turkey leg, you really should. Next year we will return. Free or not.

I hate writing negative reviews for local digs, but this place is super shady! Came in on a Friday, around 4:30, and the place was understandably dead. The server comes over and tells us about HH. 1/2 off drinks$1.50 tacos. Great, I'll have a margarita on the rocks with salt! Hubby and I order 6 tacos. I am super excited about a good deal. The tacos arrive--they are about 2 bites each, pretty good, but worth the $1.50 we paid. The drinks are great, which should have been a hint something was amiss, but I'll get to that in a minute...  We order another round of tacos for hubby and another round of drinks. In the meantime, the restaurant slowly begins to fill up, and we lose our server. After about 20 minutes, my husband waves over the manager, who sends another server, who finds our server. She comes over and we order one more round of drinks, which were ordered after happy hour, but we didn't care. Our first 2 rounds were half off, so we had no problem ordering a third. After we pay the check, we decided to mosey outside, to the patio, and enjoy our drinks. The patio is facing the busy street, and there are no seats, so we sat on the sill of the window. Not very enjoyable, but we wanted a change of scenery.   So I ask my husband about the bill, and he is kind of quiet--It was 72.00. What? 3 rounds of happy hour drinks and 9 $1.50 tacos? I was thinking $50. The hostess comes out on the patio, so I asked her about the drinks. How much is a house margarita? $8. So 50% is $4, right? Wrong. After taking a second look at the bill, we realized the server charged us for the MOST expensive margarita, and then upcharged the drink with Agave. Keep in mind, I ordered a margarita on the rocks with salt. I let the hostess know what happened. She says she will check with the server. The server tells her I ordered a "good" margarita. First of all, I was a server for 10 years. I get it. You want to make $, so you overcharged me. But that is so shady! Second of all, I never ordered a "good" margarita. I am not 21. I get how this works. At this point I am just mad. I love eating out, and I don't mind spending money on food and drinks. However, I do not like being fleeced. When we walked back through the restaurant, to go to our car, the server walked up to my husband. "Did the hostess explain your bill? I thought you knew how happy hour works?" I feel like if an explanation of the bill in necessary, that is way too complicated for a couple hours out. And, I have been to a lot of happy hours, and I guess Barrio Cafe's happy hour is unlike any I have ever been to. And I will never return. Shady.

So much better than Pizzaria Bianco! The food is excellent, as is the service and price. My hubby and I always go when we have friends or family in from out of town. Don't leave without trying the bruschetta. The pizza is flavorful and interesting. Once we were there and there was an awful guitarist which was really unpleasant. Other than that, excellent!

Black Keys=5 stars, hands down This venue=3 stars when you enter and leave, but 5 stars in the actual venue. Averaged out, 4 stars. Weird vibe coming in. Everyone is herded in like cattle. Apparently the guy who was supposed to direct women to a separate line from men was preoccupied while flirting with what appeared to be underaged young girls, so one of the security ladies yelled at me for being in the wrong line.  Once we got in, we waited in a beer line for at least 30 minutes, no exaggeration. At the helm of the line were 2 middle age ladies, who were super overwhelmed. We finally got our beer. A Michelob Shock Top, which was considered Premium, a joke in itself, but only $8 for 24 ounces. Once we sat down, the venue was awesome. We sat in the grass, on the side, and could see the Black Keys and the entire stage. The sound was great. Seemed like everyone was having a great time. Beer #2 only took about 10 minutes. As the show ends, more chaos erupts. The bathrooms are closed, so everyone has to be herded out and the only restrooms are in the same hallway as the only exit. Very strange set up. I will definitely return, but maybe not for a sold out show.

I wish I could give separate stars for food and service. This place was very busy when we walked in, as it was Glendale Glitters. We expected to wait for a table, but were pleased when we were seated immediately. We ordered the sampler for 2 and drinks. I also wanted a salad, and the sever told me it was $2, which seemed reasonable. Our drinks arrived, and we settled in to our outdoor seat. The German band was a nice touch, and the heaters kept us toasty. Our food arrived soon after we finished hubby's soup and my salad. As the food runner approached, time slowed down to slow motion. He almost slid the entire plate on my lap but, instead, he reached to balance the plate and knocked over my full soda. On my lap. On the cold patio. I was not angry about the spilled soda--I was a server forever, and these things happen. I could tell this kids was freaked out, and we felt bad for him. He grabbed some napkins, apologized profusely, and then almost took off when I asked him for a refill on soda. He brought me a refill, but left our table a complete mess. We cleaned up as much as we could, and covered the ice left on our table with a bunch of napkins. I was soaked and our table was trashed. Our server came over and brought more napkins, but did not clean up our table until prompted. Pretty strange. Also, we ordered a sampler type meal, and no one really told us what was what on the plate, so we didn't know what we were eating. The food was quite good. I can't really tell you what exactly it was, but it was a huge portion for us.    Our server also apologized but nothing else happened. If this would have happened when I was a server, I would have asked the manager to stop by the table and offer to at least buy dessert, if not the entire check. I was soaked; this wasn't a couple of drops. If you read my other reviews, I am not one to expect free food, but if there ever was a time, this was it. But, nothing was com'd. In fact, the side salad I ordered was $4 instead of $2.

Awesome place! Went there with 10 people and had drinks and food. The tuna was awesome! I had the appetizer and it was fresh and tasty. We split the baked chips with feta and hot sauce which was also excellent. Our server, Kaj, was attentive and on top of it. We did not wait for drinks at all, and this is a hard group to keep full drinks, let me tell you! I let the manager know how great everything was and he was appreciative and friendly, although, I forget his name. We had so much fun, and we will definitely return to Corbins!

May I add "family friendly" to my past reviews? We love this place because we feel like we are home when we come here. The staff is kind and they always welcome us with open arms. The manager, Kaj, literally treats us like family. We brought our new born baby to Corbin's for her first meal out, and we were thrilled with the level of service we received, as usual. The food is excellent, and the service is divine. The happy hour is awesome! My favorite items are the quesedillas, burgers, feta and hot sauced topped homemade potato chip appetizer, and the excellent selection of beers. Corbins is just an overall  great place!

Excellent food, consistently! The decor is cute; they recently remodeled. I am not a fan of the art because it is just not my taste, but the walls have colorful art work, and it appears to be a local artist, so I am a fan! This place has character and local flavor. The owners are present and friendly. The food is sooooo good! Tonight we had a new server, and we were her second table. Service wasn't great, but she seemed to be trying. She forgot our salads and when we asked for them, she still didn't bring the one we still wanted until our food was finished. Then she charged us for the salad brought at the end of our meal. My in-laws are way too nice to say something, and they were paying the bill, so I kept my mouth shut. The owner stopped by, prior to the salad incident, to see how things were going. She was friendly and complimentary to our baby, always a plus. I had the linguini with clams in a wine sauce. Outstanding! This dish tends to be oily at some restaurants, but not at Harleys. It comes in a wine sauce. So yummy! We love this place, and we will continue to return, with friends.I want to try to tiramisu. The service is typically very good, by the way.

I am not going to mark this place down for the outfits. I know the girls are forced to wear them, and few wore them well, but that is the schtick, right? The service was great. Our service was cute and bubbly, so much so I barely registered she was half naked. I thought the food was good. Maybe others did not order the right thing? It is a sports bar, people, don't order a steak and expect Ruth Chris. My husband had the black and blue burger and it was very good. It smelled so good, I grabbed a bite while he was outside on the phone (grandma's 92nd birthday). I split the nachos with my brother. They were good, but I couldn't find the chicken that was supposed to be on them. If you are on Four Square, you can get half off on an appetizer, which was nice because this place i pretty expensive. Even with a $6 deduction, our bill was $50 for 4 beers, a burger, and an appetizer.

This place has been here 7 years and we have never been. Are you kidding me? The food is excellent. The people who work here are friendly and seem to be happy to be there, which is most important. I tried the make your own half salad and half sandwich. YUMMY!!! There are many choices for salad toppings. There us nothing I like more than a huge, fresh salad. I chose to top my salad with avocado, tomato, bacon, edemame, feta cheese, and whipped balsamic vinaigrette. I really think this was the best salad I have ever had! They make the salad in front of you and mix in the perfect amount of dressing. I chose the chicken pesto sandwich. The combo of these items was a perfect portion for this hungry girl. The sandwich was excellent. My hubby ordered the Cuban pork sandwich. This is one huge sandwich! It was difficult to get his mouth around it, but once he did, it was awesome!! Typically, we don't like coleslaw, but it was really good, especially combined with the tender pork. We will return to the Market Bistro, again and again.  Loved it!!!!

Good times! We sat in the bar after leaving Augies because we could not get service. I am glad we left. The service, food, and drinks were great. I had the cobb salad. Really good. A lot of toppings and great dressing-I ordered the Italian. My hubby had the chicken sliders and curly fries. He said it was great. I stole several fries and they were really good. My bro had the wings. He wanted 2 different sauces so she brought 2 orders on separate baskets, which was great because the sauces did not mix. The reason for 4 and not 5 stars was the price. I thought it was a bit expensive. Love to see a weekend happy hour.

Okay, okay, I didn't get it and now I do. After our first experience, my husband returned and had the torta. He claims it is the BEST sandwich he has ever had--this is a big deal for my DH because he loves a great burger, but he LOVES these tortas. So I decided I had to try this place again, and I am so glad I did. We have ordered tortas to-go several times, and they are great every time.

Love this place. We went tonight, the Sunday  before Labor Day, and it was quite busy. We were quoted 45 minutes, but we were called after 15 minutes. We decided to stay at the intimate, quiet bar. Our app, the trio, took awhile, but was so worth it! We replaced the calamari, which they were out of, with more alligator. The app was great! I loved the fondeaux, but my hubby thought the alligator, which was usually moist, was king of dry. We ordered the horseradish plank tilapia and the porchartrain. The tilapia was a bit dry, without sauce. I loved my fish, but I feel like there wasn't enough sauce. The service at the bar was awesome. We will definitely return, but maybe try new entrees. The potions are huge, so we will have a great lunch.

Our favorite hang out in Phoenix, for sure. We have been there many, many times and have never had a bad, or even mediocre experience. The reason we continue to return is our favorite server, Tim. He is personable and efficient. He always pays special attention to us because he knows we are regulars. Tim loves his job and it shows! He needs a raise; we actually bring people to Bombaros because he works there. He has become a friend through serving us, which is unusual. My husband and I have tried, diligently, to become regulars some where in Phoenix. We have found our home!

I really like this place. I typically go for happy hour with the girls, but I drug my husband there last night. They have wonderful beers on draft, and the food is a nice change from typical "bar food".  My husband and I had several Smithwicks, which were cold and were delivered in a timely manner. I had the steak salad. It was a little fatty, but the dressing was awesome. Ben had the sliders, which were moist and tasty. Our server was friendly and prompt. I only have 2 small issues with this place: first, I like to sit on the patio, but every time I go there, I have to go inside and ask for service. After I ask, I usually have great service, but I would prefer to be served without asking. Second, the crowd is sort of strange. I love eclectic people, but every time I go there, there are people who try to have these strange, conservative-laden conversations with me. Not that I am intolerant of people's views, but I am having a convo with the people I came with, and it feels strange to be randomly interrupted by strangers. Not the bars fault, just an observation.

This place exemplifies the idea of service! We walked in, and the place was booked for the entire night. It was 4:30 pm on a Saturday night! The hostess agreed to find us a seat, thankfully, as we were away from our normal hood and excited to return to Blue Adobe. We have been here several times and we love it! The food and service was outstanding! Our server, Jessica, was attentive and awesome! Our food was quick and yummy. The drinks were superb. Go here, you will not regret it!

The one thing most Ohio girls love is a dive bar, and Patties is one of the best dive bars I have ever been to. The service is excellent; the drinks are strong, and the bartenders are quick. There is so much to do at Patties. You can play ping pong, darts, Golden Tee. Are they shiny new tables? No, dummy, this is a dive bar! This bar seems out of place in snotty Scottsdale, but it is a reprieve for those of us who forgot our Gucci handbags and stilettos.

Returned to this place and still love it!! I decided I would love it more if they had normal happy hours. The HH begins at 8? Strange. We would go more often if it began at 4 or 5 and lasted until 6 or 7. Just a thought.

Super cute ambiance. We came for take out after prime lunch hour, so it waspretty dead. The girl who greeted us and got our food was pleasant. Because we had never been there, my friend and I did not know how things worked, ie. Where to order, what to order. The girl seemed confused by our confusion. After a few awkward minutes trying to decide, we ordered gyros and sides. We waited for couple of minutes and got our food. The gyro was AWESOME, maybe the best I have had. My side salad was excellent with big chunks of feta and yummy Greek dressing. My only negative comment is the price. The gyro was $6, not bad. $2 for salad. And I had a soda and my bill was $11. $3 diet Coke? Seemed a bit steep.

We love that this place is near our home!  It is tucked away, behind Best Buy, so not that easy to find. I think we found it during our numerous trips to Lowes when we first moved in. My hubby and I dine here often. We always split the chicken slavaki. This meal is large enough for two people. The garlic sauce that comes with it is excellent! I am not a huge fan of the hummus. It is really greasy. Not sure if that is traditional, but I don't like it. The Greek dressing for the salad is yummy!! Always filled with cops, not sure why, but a little unnerving, for some reason...

Great food!!!! We would not have gone to this place without the rave reviews. In fact, I have never noticed Grady's, nestled in a small, half empty strip mall. The owners were so friendly and welcoming. We ordered the ribs and the chicken. The side of mac and cheese is excellent! Creamy, with a bit of a crunch. The ribs were great! A little fatty, but the portion was so large, the center cut, that I was only able to finish about 1/3 of the meal. My husband had the chicken, but he liked my ribs so much, he finished my meal. We will definitely be back for seconds!

So I have eaten here at least 10 times, usually love it. However, went there last week and ordered the Santa Fe Eggs Benedict, which is usually my fav, when I am eating carbs. I could not believe this was the meal I was wasting my valuable calorie intake on! The sauce literally tasted like paste---flour and water. When I told the manager/owner/whatever, he said, "You should have told me." I am thinking, "I am telling you!" Didn't offer a discount, cup of coffee, kind word. I think he said he was sorry, which did not solve the problem of the gross meal I had just consumed. My hubby said his pancakes were average. Has the reputation of this place gone to their heads? I hope not. Owning a home in North Phoenix, I enjoy the prospect of Sunnyslope as the new "it" place to be.

Still haven't returned...the manager did email me and invite me back to get a gift certificate. My thought is, why would I return to a place and ask a GC when there are so many options? Plus, don't want to have to re-explain my review. Seems a bit pointless. Not looking for free food.

I know, you are thinking, "Ann, why do you keep going back to Scramble?" My answer is my family and friends like this place, and it is close to my house and our favorite hiking spot. What am I missing? I know, I know, I should stop complaining and just go elsewhere...I have given Scramble chance after chance and nothing changes. I am like an abused person who just can't walk away...I went on Sunday; my sister and her bf were here, we wanted to climb Camelback and needed something quick. We got a late start, and I called almost every place in town, but there was at least a 30 minute wait. SO...we went back to Scramble. Oh Scramble, I want to love you. You are in the perfect location, you even let me bring my puppy. I want to love you. I just can't. I ordered the Santa Fe Benedict. I know, you are thinking, "But Ann, that is what you ordered last time and it was terrible."  The truth is, I used to love this dish. It was spicy and yummy. I ordered iced tea and they were out, and it was going to be 30 minutes to brew more. Must be the longest brewing tea of all time, but okay, I'll drink something else. Next, we sit down and the floor is covered in food. Not food from the table before ours, but food from many tables from all morning. Pieces of squished bacon and pancakes, all under our feet. So gross. I switched seats, so I could not see or step on the food because, Scramble, I want to love you. My husband asked the waitress to sweep up the mess and she did immediately, which was awesome. The wait staff is super cute and nice, which is another reason Scramble, I want to love you. But the food on the floor was really bad. Then, our food came, What happened to the Santa Fe Eggs Benedict I knew and loved? There was barely any sauce on the dish, so the cornbread, which was pretty dry to begin with, could not even be covered with the sauce. The ham was fatty and overcooked. Everyone else loved their meals. I don't get it. Well, I have given up on my attempts to love you, my dear Scramble. You will not miss me; you have many admirers. I only wish things could have worked out between us...

Love this place for HH. I am not even sure of the specials, but the beer is cold, service is prompt, and they always get our checks right, even with big parties!

Great food and drinks! Service is good but not always great. Flatbreads and wings are excellent. Can't beat the view!

Can't believe this place put up with the drunkiness we came with! 6 girls, on the prowl--what could go wrong? Not much at Hula's!! Wonderful, affordable food and drinks. My only complaint is we had a reservation and waited around an hour for our table. Not much of a complaint; we sat at the bar and drank ALOT!! Excellent food and service.

I am not sure how the food or drinks are at this place because they were so understaffed, we were unable to get a beer. After putting our name in, we went to the bar and waited for at least 10 minutes and could not get any service. There was one bartender and she was working hard. I cannot believe this place would be short staffed on a Saturday night. There was a Spring Training game that night, too and only a couple of places to grab a bite prior to the game. One would think there would be several bartenders on a night like this. We decided to leave and probably not come back.

Stingray has some of the most creative sushi I have had here in the Valley. I went to this location on Friday during happy hour. It was PACKED in the bar area, and there was really no where to stand. We got drinks at the bar, but because it was so packed, a patron of the bar spilled one of our drinks all over herself, while she was trying to hand it to me. I felt awful! We found a stand around table. Once we got to the table, our experience improved. Our waitress, I think her name was Kelly, was knowledgeable and friendly. The service was outstanding, even though it was super busy. We paid $100 for 8 saki bombers and 9 rolls! Amazing food and service!!

How have I never been here until now? My life in Phoenix improved exponentially when I walked in this gem! I have heard about The Vig, but did not go there until last night. I am planning a social event there next week, so I thought I would check the place out. I am so glad I did. Darren, the manager, is friendly and helpful. The vibe in this place is super cool and laid back. If you make the correct decision and check this place out, tell them you support Arizona School for the Arts. They are donating 15% of their profits to my school.   We met two of our fav people at The Vig at 4pm on Friday. The drink menu is fun and unique. The girls chose a drink with strawberry and basil. Sound interesting? It was. After one of those drinks, we switched it up and tried the Sucker Punch. I am not sure what was in that drink, but it was a little piece of Heaven! The food was great. We snacked on chips and guac and potato skins topped with a cheese doodle.   The service was phenomenal. Our server was prompt and friendly. We will definitely return to The Vig! Maybe our new favorite!

I am sooooo excited my neighborhood finally has a place we can go for great food! My husband and I stopped in to this small establishment, and we were greeted by two smiling faces. We ordered the reuben for me, and my husband ordered a single cheeseburger. We both ordered fries. We also chose 2 sodas from the exciting selection. My husband and I decided to get our food to go. As soon as we got into the car, my husband said, "oh my gosh, that smells awesome!" The food looked excellent. The thinly cut fries were fresh, made to order, and the reuben was HUGE!! It tasted as good as it looked. My husband swears the burger was much better than Lenny's, which is a big compliment from him. We will definitely return, maybe even this week. I hope locals frequent this place, so it stays open for a long, long time!!!YUMMY!

How can I be craving a Rocket Burger Reuben and I have only had 3 in my life? That is how delish this place is! Went there for carryout today. The owners are super nice, as usual. When I got home, mu food was piping hot and YUMMY! I hope everyone in the Northern Phx area begins frequenting this semi hidden gem. The food is excellent and affordable and the service is the best!

My husband was worried about my Yelp cred when I told him I was going to write a Yelp review for Chili's, but I told him it was my duty to report our experience. We walked in to Chili's at 6:50 on a Thursday night. Chili's was about half way full. I was actually surprised it was not very busy because it was a couple days before Christmas. Anyway, we decided to sit in the bar area. We sat down and ordered our drinks, 2 nonalcoholics, and a sampler platter. Our drinks took at least 10 minutes. I became a bit nervous because I am pregnant, and I knew I needed food in a timely manner. Our server walked around the bar area as if she were a patron---slowly and without purpose. She didn't speak to us other than to take our order and drop off the check. No convo required, but a check in would have been helpful. She also had almost every table in the bar area, which eventually filled up. Still, no sense of urgency.   The best part of Chili's is the acoustics. We could ease drop on the table next to us without a problem while we waited for our food. We heard the table complaining to the manager that their appetizer was taking forever. I was appalled to hear the manager blame the long ticket time on another table---apparently, another table stole their appetizer! Meanwhile, we are waiting for our appetizer. One appetizer ended up taking 30 minutes. I am not kidding. 30 minutes. When it arrived at 7:35, it was cold and the dressing were warm, meaning the food sat in the window for quite a while, waiting to be run to our table. As we finished our food, the table next to us finally got their food. While I know my review should be about my personal experience, I thought it was pretty interesting that the table next to us had the same level of service we did, but they actually spoke to a manager, twice. We were at this location for about 45 minutes, and the only time I saw the manager was at the behest of this irate table. Chili's is not our normal stomping grounds, and this experience reminds me why.

I am not really a huge fan of hot dogs. Yes, I know it is the trendy new thing, but I am always behind the trend. Until now---I finally tried the Short Leash Dog, and there is no going back! I tried the Oliver Dog, which is your choice of dog, I chose the chicken dog, covered with 1000 Island, sauerkraut, and Swiss cheese. The best part of the dog is the pita like bread the dog comes in. It is fresh and moist. I could eat the bread alone, but topped with a juicy chicken dog, and all the toppins', I could not ask for a better lunch on a beautiful, sunny, Phoenix, Friday afternoon.

A friend of ours from out of town planned a dinner here for 9 people last Friday night. After reading the reviews, I was excited to go to Beckett's Table. We may not have gone here on our own because the location is pretty out of our way, but I am glad we did. Our server, Brandon, was awesome! He was knowledgeable and helpful, and he made our visit extra enjoyable. My hubby and I showed up on time while the rest of our party was running late. Rather than punish us for being there on time, the hostesses sat us immediately. We ordered our drinks and the grilled cheese and tomato soup appetizers. What a great idea! I thought it might be a bit strange for an appetizer, but it was the perfect amount of food to tide us over until our party arrived. We dipped the sandwich into the creamy, spicy soup.  YUMMY! After our party arrived, they ordered appetizers. I did not try the roasted feta appetizer, but it looked delish and my friends really enjoyed it. My main course was as good as the appetizer. I had the flank steak. Usually a flank steak is not the best cut of meat, but this steak was excellent!! Thickly cut and tender; this steak was perfectly prepared. We will definitely return to this place, and we will request to sit in Brandon's section.

My sister lives in Austin where food trucks are on almost every corner, so when I heard the trucks were coming to Phoenix, I was super psyched!! My co workers and I headed down on Friday around 1pm. The trucks are parked close to my school, so we got there quickly, and there was tons of parking, and no lines to wait in. When we arrived, there was such a variety, I wasn't sure what to pick. We tried to find a money machine, but realized, to our delight, most of the truck accept credit. I chose to go to Jamburritos and did not regret my choice. I order the jambalaya and it was awesome! The dish was spicy and delicious! I will return and this time, my choice will not be difficult; I will go to Jamburritos!

I drive past this place all of the time. I finally stopped in tonight, and I am so glad I did!  The menu is not huge, but big enough to offer variety. I chose all carne asada--2 tacos, a quesadilla, beans and rice, and a spicy burro-all to take home and split with my hubby. Everything was so good! The carne asada was tender and perfectly seasoned. We will definitely return for future carry out. Yum Yummy!

My husband says, "Can you write a review when I brought you food and you did not go to the restaurant?" I replied, "Yes I can!" Love In and Out! In fact, people who live in states without In and Out are jealous of those of us who are able to enjoy the succulent burgers whenever we want! The burgers are juicy and yummy. I am not a huge fan of the fries, but because the burgers are so good, the fires are really an after thought for me. I wish they would embrace the idea of a curly fry. No one really offers a good curly fry any more. Other than Chipolte, this is the only fast food my hubby and I eat, and we eat it rarely, but now with the new location, we are becoming regulars. So glad they are breathing new life into this area which is our part of town!

As I entered, I was thinking, "Am I in Phoenix?"  We needed a cool place to see movies and we got one! My friend Perry actually filmed a documentary and his premiere was on Monday. What a neat space! As you walk in, there is a bar on your left. As you go to the right, there is a beautiful room, cozily decorated in an almost Moroccan theme. I love the chairs; they are like elevated cushions--super comfortable! The staff was attentive and friendly. We entered the theater and was greeted by the guy who chooses the films (I am not sure of his actual title). He gave a pretty long intro and talked to the crowd a lot about how he chooses movies, etc. Pretty interesting, but we were already sold; we were there. Would have liked to hear from Perry longer instead of this guy! The theater is adorable. I believe it has 70 seats. Behind the normal seating, there are several bar tables and chairs. We watched the previews, which were super original and funny. I am thinking, again, "There is no other place like this in Phoenix." Excellent! On Mondays they offer $3 movies from local producers and film makers. I want to be a regular here! As Arnold says, "We will Back!!!!!!"

My house has never been this clean EVER!!! I am thrilled with the level of service and professionalism expressed by the women who cleaned my house today! I bought a Living Social coupon, and I am so glad I found this company. 5 women arrived and fully cleaned my house in 45 minutes. The women were friendly to me and especially my dog, which is the sign of a wonderful company, if you ask me. I am hoping I am able to use this service on a monthly basis. Angela scheduled my appointment immediately when I let her know I had company coming in town, and the cleaners arrived during the scheduled time. I am thrilled with the results!

After exploring other options, we returned to Timo to find a much more organized, efficient experience. The weather was perfect for outdoor dining, so the hubby and I decided to give Timo another try. We were seated next to the fire pit and approached immediately by our server. The service was excellent; we did not have to wait long for anything, and the server was pleasant. We ordered a bottle of red wine and then we ordered all of our food to share. The artichoke dip is excellent. One of the best we have had. Next, we had the chopped salad. The salad was excellent, but I am not too sure if it had dressing on it. Next we had the margarita flat bread with sausage. We finished our evening with the peach cobbler. Everything was outstanding and relatively reasonably priced. We will definitely return to Timo and bring friends. I was thrilled to have such a wonderful experience because I know how difficult it is for restaurants to succeed in this economy, but Timo is well on its way as a staple in Sunnyslope.

Kinda dead up in here. Awesome burger...the caprese. Fries a bit bland. In a great mood, so the lipstick on my glass didn't even bother me. The server switched my beer out, no problem. I wasn't even that annoyed! Am I getting soft on my reviews? No, just hoping a local place succeeds in this economy. This place needs some business because it should be packed! Cute, clean, and a perfect alternate to Il Posto. Snowbirds would love this place.

So disappointing. Wednesday night at 5:30pm, so management can't blame customers for coming in late. Sad because the food is amazing, but we literally just waited almost an hour for food. The place was empty beside one other table (who were eating when we got there). Our server never said anything until after the food finally came. When we mentioned it had taken a long time, he said there was a new chef and then walked away. Dropped our checks and boxes-no apology, no thank you. We won't be back, which is unfortunate as we really thought the food was great and we live close by.

I agree with another poster who loved the urban vibe of this restaurant/bar. What a cool place! We had a reservation and were seated immediately. Once seated, we waited for a while for service. I flagged down the manager, and a server came over immediately. The drink menu is extensive with over 30 specialty drinks, so I decided to forgo my usual beer for a fancy beverage, a Absinthe Fizz. My husband stuck with a glass of Pino. When our drinks arrived, mine was frothy and delicious! I highly recommend trying this drink if you want something refreshing but not froo froo. We order the tater tots as an appetizer, per a suggestion from a Kimpton sales rep my husband met through work. I ordered the Yellowfin Tuna Carpaccio and my husband ordered the Kentucky Fried Quail. The tots were wonderful, but I really didn't get the sauce. It was cold and did not have much flavor. Our food arrived while we were working on our appetizer. The entrees were excellent! Portions are small, but were fine for a light dinner. We actually went across the street to Copper Blues for a drink, then we returned to Blue Hound for a nightcap. We ended up sitting in a cozy booth by the bar upon our return. We ordered the Mac N Cheese to split and Tommy's Margarita. The Mac N Cheese was wonderful, but the portion was quite small. On the flip side, the prices are super reasonable, so if you are really hungry, order 2 appetizers with your meal. A couple of kinks, which is to be expected when you choose to dine at a new restaurant.  There were many items on the menu I wanted to try, so we will definitely return!

Food is yummy!!!! I have never been to a 5 Guys, so I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered a burger, unaware that it is actually a double burger, which was HUGE! Hubby and I shared a large fry. We could have easily split a burger and a small fry. Love that fact that "everything" includes grilled mushrooms and onions. So much food. This location was messy. I am not sure of the peanuts are a great idea because there are shells and dust everywhere.

YUMMY! I think this was the best sandwich I have ever had. When I walked into the restaurant with my stroller, one of the workers asked if I would like to give them my order at the table instead of waiting in line with the baby. Score! Anyone willing to make my life easier at this point earns major kudos from me. I ordered the roast beef sandwich, chips, and a large drink. I also orders an Italian sandwich to-go for the hubster. The sandwiches were huge--all for $13. The hot peppers, which is what Potbelly is famous for, really make the sandwich heavenly! The peppers give the sandwich a little bite. SO good! Well Potbelly, you are my new go-to place, replacing your across the street neighbor in my weekly repertoire!

I am surprised by all of the negative reviews because our experience was excellent! We went to Native today to watch football. The place is immaculate. Our server was outstanding! Derek was attentive and on top of it. We came with 6 people, and Derek kept our drinks and bellies full. The wings weren't great, but we also had cheeses ticks, flat bread and tater tots, and they were all really good. My bloody Mary was great--spicy and yummy. We will definitely be back!

I have returned to Yelp after a hiatus to leave a review because this place is so amazing! The staff treats me and my husband and 2 year old like family. The food is delicious. I had not had pho until I tried this place, and we have returned almost weekly for several months. The special is great: pho, spring rolls, and a soda for $10! We love coming here, and we have returned with friends and family. Run, don't walk, for outstanding food and friendly service.
