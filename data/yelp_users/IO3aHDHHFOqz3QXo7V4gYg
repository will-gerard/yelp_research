The trunk space is a semi-good place to see live shows. I have noticed that they seem to follow a strict genre of music. Keeping more to popular-punk but still underground-emo for mostly high school kids, but also like bands that cross this genre with experimental types as well. One thing about the Trunk Space, NO AC!! Damn that place is hotter than a steam room. If you like to be crowded in a small room with emo kids, welcome to the Trunk Space.

It's a sad day. The day before Record Store Day and the realization that the last decent part of Americana is almost extinct. The corner record store is almost completely dead, thanks to Amazon.com and Walmart. Stinkweeds will never die. It will be the last of the dinosaurs and keep going. About the size of your work break room, but still the same experience. I don't think the store will ever change and thank god for that. I bought my first punk LP at stinkweeds and still go there for rare punk music. I like the fact that it is small, quiet and the selection is always changing for the better. Can't wait until my visit. Thank you Stinkweeds. Happy Record Store Day!!!

OMG!! Large selection of beer in big glasses and anything you would eat at dinner stuff in a loaf. I like the turkey, stuffing and cranberry pasty. Other good Pasties include the taco and the chicken fettuccine. Great food, kind of a old mine lunch motif and great story about Cornwall.
