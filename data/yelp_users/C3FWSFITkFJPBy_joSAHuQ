My girlfriend and I went there this past Sunday for the second time.  We went previously for my birthday and had a great experience.  The food is always great and very hot when it comes out.  I love steak so it is always right up my alley.  This past Sunday's experience fell short.  Our waitress, although nice, was not attentive and did not listen to what we had to say.  We ordered an appetizer and needed it prepared in a certain way, but it did not come out as we ordered.  We saw our waitress all of three times the entire night.  My girlfriend ordered a bottle of wine which was on the "last call" list.  We waited 20 minutes before she came to tell us that the bottle was not available.  The busboy that was associated with our waitress might as well have been our server.  He was great.  He made sure everything was to our liking and even refreshed my girlfriends wine glass.    When the food did arrive, we were satisfied with it.  The two times that we have been, the food is always exceptional.  But, you can't help but notice the lack of service.  I have to say it did affect our time there on Sunday, but won't hold us back from coming back.  We can only hope that the service will be better the next time.

I have been a fan of discount tire all my life. My dad gets all his vehicles serviced here. Recently my tire had a nail in it. One other tire place told me that they cannot repair it because the tread was too low and that I need to buy from them. Found out that discount is the place to go the hard way. Went there with a spare on. They immediately took my tire in and were able to fix it! they werent trying to make a sketch profit like the other place. just good people. Very honest. and willing to help/safe. Good customer makes $$$ not lying with bad service like the other place.

All I can say is that they have the friendliest and most accommodating staff I've ever dealt with. They go as far as they can to help the customer and assure them everything is ok.

This place has done more for myself and my family than I can imagine! They strived to make each of us as happy as possible. I wouldn't recommend going anywhere else. The office is beautiful, friendly staff and Dr. Petlin and Dr. McCracken are the best at what they do.

This place has been here since I have been into the skate/rollerblade scene when I was 8. I have long since outgrown blading and trick skateboarding but still love to cruise on a longboard. Went in here to get some longboard service recently. The staff was really friendly and willing to help. Just a fun environment in there. Lots of great clothes. My gf buys me stuff from there and you can never go wrong with their style. They had everything. Just wish they still sold goped stuff because that trend is scarce now. The staff even let me use a allen wrench from my board to my car wheel outside with no issues!

I went to Chelsea's Kitchen about a month ago to see what all the hype was about.  I have to say  I was extremely disappointed in every aspect of the restaurant.  The food was subpar and especially for how expensive it was.  They do give generous portions, but overall the menu options are not one of restaurant with a 4 star rating and their kind of reputation as being an Arcadia "staple".  I had the cheeseburger and my girlfriend had the fried chicken which according to our server was the best option.  It was a standard burger and my girlfriend said the chicken was dry and not worth the amount.  The waitstaff was good and the service was exceptional, but the food falls short.  I'm glad I went, but won't be coming back.

I came here due to another parter gmc dealer in Simi Valley. They connected me to here. The service was great, craftsmanship impeccable, and the price was very fair. They connected to GM hq in no time and provided me the answers I need. Even if you live far away make the drive to go here

The Tavern On Mill tucked away nicely into one of Mill's culd de sac's. It is one of the original bars that has been there for over nine years! Many of the places on mill can only dream about that. Many go in and out of business very quickly with draining popularity. I have only been to The Tavern On Mill a handful of times. First time I went it was with a friend for some Happy Hour and meals with the coupons we had! Got to try more than 8 beers and had great food to eat as well! The place offers many different beers on tap that any palate would like along with a myriad of drinks. I recently stopped in there with my girlfriend because we were across the street and was an easy place to go! Turns out I got to meet the owner who is an extremely nice guy; Steve. The place has an unbelievable happy hour that last a long time and is extremely extremely affordable especially for students. The music is great! Lots of rock, alternative, hip hop whatever. This is the best well rounded place on mill. A restaurant bar that can one can be at from the day hours to HH to partying all night. The food is absolutely tremendous. I had the chicken wings (buffalo). So much flavor, zest and just the right amount of spice! The mac n cheese is done with a white sauce white is perfect for a change and is the best mac n cheese I've ever had. I didn't even get it with the bacon, or chicken (which not many other places offer.) The wings are phenomenal. The sandwiches there are amazing as well. Haven't heard one bad thing about this place. The atmosphere is great! Friendly staff that is attentive and people of all ages are here enjoying their time. The new owners definitely know how to cater to Tempe and with more changes to come this will definitely be a top spot on Mill and the toughest contender for all the other bars! LOOKOUT! The young aspirations and ideas have done and will continue to do this place wonders! A 20/10.

Food was overpriced for what it was, and the quality was borderline gross. The person making the food was pulling up their shirt and scratching their stomach the entire time. Not going back there.

My gf recently got her car oil changed here. The man took care of her and was very honest. Filled her tires with air, changed the filter and was speedy as he was the only one working there. Nice guy. Did a great job and even took care of engine light issues. he went above and beyond. Def cheaper than going elsewhere and with better service!

Every time I have been to 5th and Wine, no complaints at all.  Great vibe, great prices, and great service.  The wings are outstanding and the burger is great as well.  The wine prices are fabulous as the portions are just right.  My girlfriend loves the bruschetta as well as all of the other items on the menu.    Perfect zest and quality to the wings.  We always come back to 5th and Wine.  Parking can be difficult, but it's usually fine whenever I have gone.

Let me start out....I am a huge fan of Fox Concept restaurants and have had nothing but good experiences at most, except Culinary.  The staff and service are both excellent, but I cannot get on board with the food.  Nothing special and a little pricey for what you are getting.  The atmosphere and decor of Culinary are both awesome and trendy, but the menu needs a little updating.  The drinks are fun, but the salad and the burger that I have had are bland, dry, and not worth the cost.    I am always more than excited for a Fox Concept restaurant, but Culinary is not my favorite.

Just went here with my girlfriend. Good service. Good food. Repeat customer. However, I left my credit card and literally came back 5 minutes later and the manager and the front desk girl were rude to me saying they don't have it and it is not in their books. How is that possible? I just left and they had to of picked up the card w the receipt. Very upset and WILL NOT be coming back. In terms of a fox concept restaurant I am very disappointed.

The main guy there, John is just a great dude. He took care of my watches and very fast. I sat on the sofa and he replaced everything that needed help. Batteries, bands, straps etc!

North is by far my favorite fox concept restaurant or actually my favorite restaurant in the Arcadia neighborhood.  The food is classic, has just the right amount of seasoning and flavor and is priced just right.  The decor is unique and brings a neighborhood feel to the restaurant as does the wait staff.  I have been numerous times and have had nothing short of an amazing experience.  It's never over crowded and the service is always great.    This is a staple for me in the Phoenix area.

I went to this restaurant last week with my girlfriend and her roommate. First off, this place really is "Wooohoooo! As good as it gets!" I was enthralled to see that type of ambience that this area/restaurant offered. Pinnacle Peak is a gorgeous area with breathtaking desert scenery. Soul Café takes the word "café" to a whole new level. I had no idea that it would be that nice but it was pleasantly taken aback. I went here for dinner and I guess it just opened up for that time of night. It is usually a breakfast and lunch time place. But still, the dinner was phenomenal! I had the steak and fries! Great portions and reasonably priced for a place that exquisite is something to be found there. No more leaving still hungry because you got an expensive steak that took you spread five bites over the entire dinner! The live music~the best part of the evening~ was performed by a regular group called "WHAT4." I believe they play during the day as well but their music set the mood singlehandedly. They literally can play ANYTHING. I found myself liking songs they performed better than the ones on the radio, etc!! Some songs I solely liked because they performed. The musicians were very friendly and was a great duo!! Sure they has lots of success! Definitely something to see if you haven't already! They were not distracting and played any request you wanted. Songs from The Beatles, Fleetwood Mac, to current hot songs. They are very talented indeed! Again, at 13/10 rating for me!

I have had nothing but great experiences at morning squeeze.  The wait can be long on the weekends, but thats expected for anywhere in Old Town.  The food is good, the portions are perfect, and the service is always good.  No complaints here.  It can be pricey, but that's also expected for any place in Old Town.  This is my go-to breakfast spot in the Old Town area.  Skip RnR and The Breakfast club and go to Morning Squeeze.

My girlfriend and I always start here when we decide to come to mill.  This is our go to.  I have to say we haven't eaten here a whole lot, but when we have the food is great!  Great quality food for a great price.  You  can tell the beans don't come from a can and that the salsa is made in house every day.    We usually just sit at the bar and drink before we start our night, for happy hour or to catch a game/event downtown.  The service is exceptional at Loco bar none.  We always are well taken care of at loco and haven't had even the slightest bad experience.    For instance, yesterday we stopped in for a few drinks and there was some miscommunication between the guys working the bar.  We didn't get a drink as soon as we usually do, but the guy that was helping us was more than apologetic and even bought us a free round!  A tasty little treat.    Loco plays the best music out of any bar on mill.  A good mix between 90's and current EDM but very relaxing overall.  Just what I am in the mood for 99% of the time.    Clean place, great food, great service! What is not to love!

I went there as a referral from my friend. I needed something done that was not an easy install by any means. It was at least a 10-14 hour job and other places were quoting me at crazy prices. Paul helped me out immensely. My truck was given a lot of attention as promised. Paul and his crew even stayed after hours and came in on a Sunday to finish my truck. That is some true dedication that other shops wouldn't even consider. I could not be happier with my outcome. The part performs well. Paul gave me a super reasonable price. He was attentive to my pricing concerns and made sure I was ok with the price. It was all extremely fair. The craftsmanship was great too. Don't waste your time anywhere else. Other places will only give you a higher price, and not be able to give the type of attention to detail Paul and his crew did. He is truly dedicated. Thank you PCC! I will be coming back for all my car needs!

This place has great deals and not mention Paul is a terrific  dude. I am so impressed by the hard work and dedication they give to each customer. Go here!
