This isn't the Four Seasons or even a Starewood or Hilton, so let's get that out of the way. This is a budget hotel for the casual traveler who is going to be in the heart of PHX for a couple or few days. First of all, the price is right...seriously right. Secondly, the accommodations are better than you'd expect for the price. The rooms are super clean and updated. The beds are comfy and the shower is nice. I got a Jr. suite and it has a pull out bed from the love seat and the bedroom is closed off by a door for privacy. There's a mini fridge, microwave and coffee station.The hotel is small enough that you could call it a boutique. None the less there are kids and morons who also stay there and wake up early making a racquet, but again this is a budget friendly lodge.  There's a lovely pool and BBQ area though I didn't try it. Also, they have a pretty legit breakfast with eggs and waffles and all that delicious biz...and it's free. Maybe I was lucky, but I got to check in early and check out late, and that was complimentary as well. Parking was a breeze and though it appears that your in the boonies your close to everything. Oh, and if you want to do a nature walk or a hike, Dreamy Draw is less than half a mile away. There are some other perks like food delivery and laundry which surely come at a price, but I wouldn't know. What I do know is that they have great customer service. The only reason I'm not giving a 5 is bc of the noise. Soundproofing could be better, but it was tolerable.   I would recommend this place to anyone!  To Glockonfire, you must not know your way around Phoenix because this is a very desirable area. Are you sure you weren't at a different Best Western on the west side? This hotel is on a mountain preserve and surrounded by expensive condos and gated communities. Not to mention its a 2 minutes drive from the Pointe Hilton Resort on Squaw Peak.  To the other reviews about cleanliness and service, my experience was way better. Change of management or ownership?  Who knows!

If you missed lunch  and you're too hungry to wait for dinner, go to Mi Pueblo. At 4pm, I got the 6 half chicken tacos and they hit the spot. Muy Rico! The interior is exactly as you would expect in a old strip mall joint. But you're not here for the ambiance. It's the food and it's good and the price is right.  I'll make a point to come back at a proper lunch time. I bet it gets packed.

I came in upon a friend's recommendation for my annual check up. It was the basic drill. Check in, paperwork, wait, pee in a cup, wait, see the nurse for vitals, undress, wait, see doc, dress, blood work, pay, reschedule. Clearly, those are a lot of steps with different people in different rooms of the office. The problem is that no one bothers to tell you where to go or what to do next. If you are brand new to the office, you better buck up and figure it out yourself. Don't bother asking for help. Asking questions only irritates the staff and they aren't shy to show you that they think you are stupid for not knowing their exact urine sample procedures. Grrrr!  So the doctor was nice enough...no complaints on that front.  The girls in the blood lab were really the only people with any personality, compassion or care at all.   I ended up getting a follow up call on the blood work that turned out to be nothing thankfully. However, I was appalled at the process. They left and abrupt, alarming and very vague voice mail. When I called back, I got lost in their automated system and then put on hold for an eternity. They finally asked me who had called me...needed the name of the nurse. I was like..."I don't know. Can't you look me up?  Don't you have a computer?". After much haggling  I finally spoke to someone who could tell me what was wrong with me. Well, that's an overstatement.  I asked a couple of elementary questions and the lady couldn't answer a thing and recommended that  I go to WebMD to get answers. Really?   So, I came back for a follow up visit, hoping the experience would be more pleasant. It wasn't as bad, but certainly substandard.  Coming to the lady-doctor isn't my favorite thing to do. It's not comfortable or enjoyable. A good practice in my opinion would compensate with outstanding customer service. Cornerstone could use a little...er a lot...of training in the way of customer service.

When it comes to airport eatin's, Paradise Bakery is at the top of the list. Yes, it's a chain, but it's not fast, over priced and sloppy. Rather it is fast, appropriately priced and prepared with care. It's the same great quality that you would expect from any other Paradise. The Fuji Apple Salad is yum and the Thai Chicken Wrap is fantastic. The service and cleanliness are great. Sometimes you can even get free cookie samples at the counter and most meals include a cookie. Just stopping by Paradise for some "chippers" to take to your friends or clients or just for a snack on the plane is worth it.   My only hangup is that Paradise is pre-security, so unless you're eating before security, skip the drink and dress your salad or wrap before you get to TSA. Parfaits do not pass security. You've been warned!

I used to have this anorexic friend.  She would join us girls for dinner sometimes.  She would never order anything of course, and when the food would come she would squirm in her seat, roll her eyes and say, "Are you seriously going to eat that?". When I took the lid off my Julio's Too take out, I had a flash back of my anorexic friend and I thought, "I'm not sure this time.".   I'm from Texas.  I know TexMex and I love it.  No offense, to the other Yelpers who have used the term, but this is not TexMex.  This is more like a Mexi-Mess!  I ordered the chili relleno and green chili corn tamale which was presented in a foil tin mixed with refried beans and rice.  I'll give them credit for the beans and rice.  That was good, but the rest...hmmmm.  The chili relleno was drowned in a glob of greasy cheese.  I'm not trying to say, that the chili relleno is the healthy choice.  It's breaded and sometimes fried.  It is never soggy or submerged in goo...unless you order from Julio's Too.  As for the green chili tamale.  In Texas, tamales are much smaller.  The corn (or maize as they say) is much more understated allowing the filling to really stand out.  This tamale was like a men's size 12 corn shoe with a little bit if cheese and green chili inside.  It was also, encased in a tomb of cheese that I had to dig through before I finally found the tamale.  I won't go in to the salsa.  The other Yelpers got it right.    Now, I do like the location, the vibe and the service.  I would ride my bike over there for chips and guacamole with friends.  They have a convenience store selection of beverages and a nice patio, which merit an extra star.  I'm not trying to be a jerk with this review, but this is just what I think.

I took my 4runner in for a general tune up and some preventative maintenance. They were extremely friendly. They took their time to explain my options in a way that made sense to me and the final bill was reasonable. They were courteous of my time, so I didn't have to wait around at all. Also, when I had some questions about something after the service, they were great. I was invited back to the shop where they listened to my concern and double checked that everything was okay...and it was. Thanks Whitey's!

I discovered Seville Cleaners off Yelp and I've been pleased. I know that no business is 100%, and the reviews suggest that they have fouled with other customers, but not with me. They are very courteous and helpful. The prices are palatable and the work is good.  On top of that, they have late weekday hours and wknd hours so I never feel like my wardrobe has been impounded because I can't beat closing time. Also, the one day turn around at Seville has saved my ass more than once!  So...good job!

It's taken a few tries at different places with different technology to finally find a laser treatment center that is friendly, professional, accommodating, affordable, effective and relatively painless.  I started off treating just a couple of areas, but I've pretty much upgraded to full body.  I wouldn't go so far if I didn't see results and feel comfortable.   Can't wait for the final final results!!

The Dog Park at Chaparral Park is AWESOME!  It is so well maintained, spacious and clean.  There are actually 3 areas.  One is for active dogs, one is for passive dogs and the third area is always closed for regrowth, and they rotate.  I love this because we can always count on grass.  Our day's of going to dead-grass and dirt dog parks are OVER!    The park is safe and well appointed with water fountains and play areas for the dogs.  There are shaded areas and plenty of places to sit and visit with other dog owners.  There are plenty of garbage cans and clean-up bags and dog run type entrance and exit gates to prevent escapes.  And, the park is big so you can run your dog's energy gauge down to EMPTY!  Most owners take responsibility for their dogs so we don't have to worry too much about fights, ball thieves or wild horn-dogs.  The people that frequent the dog park are all great people.  Its a great place to get outside and socialize with the neighbors!  So, leash up, grab the Kong ball and your pooch and come on out to the dog park!

Given the choice between The Bean and the Bucks, I will always choose The Coffee Bean!  The coffee is better. The service is great. It's never as crowded. There are fewer children. (Starbucks might as well add a jungle gym....kids LOVE their lattes!). It's comfy. Plenty of outlets and free wifi. You can really get some work done.   My only wish is for a drive thru.

What's not to love about Chick-Fil-A? The original chicken sandwich and waffle fries is the best combo and compared to other fast food options, its not terribly horrible for you.  But,if you are really trying to be good, the grilled chicken sandwich is good.  You can ask for no butter on the bun and order a side salad. If you really want to be bad, they have yummy brownies and ice cream.    Also, the people who work at Chick Fil A are so nice and friendly!  They always say, "my pleasure" instead of "your welcome." See for yourself!  They will refill your drink and clear your table and ask you you're doing.  Its like fast food with sit down style courtesy.  We all complain that Chick Fil A is closed on Sundays, but I like it because it makes the other 6 days  that you can go to Chick Fil A even more special!  Haha!

Know what fits perfectly between your morning workout and a mani/pedi? Answer:  Bertha's granola with yogurt and coffee. And if it's a beautiful day and you can ride your bike....even better!

If you work downtown around Adams and Central, Jacquee's is a great place to grab some grub to take back to your desk for lunch or breakfast.  Don't let the long line during the lunch rush fool you.  The wait isn't bad.  The selection is good for a soup and sandwich joint with lots of healthy choices or full flavor.  You can get a complete meal, or if you just want a snack, there are several a la carte options throughout the day along with coffee and treats.   The thing that impresses me the most is that they always remember my name and greet me as if I'm their best customer ever...when I know that I am far from it!

This review is for the solo diner on her lunch break.  If you need a quiet place for conversation or a table for 3 or more, this might not be the best place for you.    About once a week I need about 45 minutes and a little bit of curry to get my head straight.  The Thai Elephant is only an elevator ride away from my office and it is tried and true....CONSISTANTLY wonderful in every way.  Though it is always crowded at lunch, there is always a table for one.  The lunch menu isn't too skimpy, but is limited enough to make the choosing easy.  The lunch prices are right.  A full meal including rice, a spring roll and soup WITH  a good tip is less than $12.  With prices like that, how can you afford not to!!  I always get the masaman curry.  It haver changes and is delicious every time. The wait staff is prompt and courteous and they always take good care of me. The place is clean and comfortable despite the crowds.  Again, I wouldn't come here for a lunch meeting or an office outing.  It is way too small for that.  I do recommend it for take out if you are the type to bring your curry to the offie!!  (Do it!  Your co-workers will LOVE you!  Everyone loves the smell of ethnic food in the work place!!)  Thanks Thai Elephant.  See you next week!

Professionalism, Quality, Style & Service....check, check, check!  I've made the rounds with various stylists over the past year or so that I've been coming here and I've only had one disappointing experience, but that was partly my fault for going cheap and selecting the low-level stylist.  All the rest have been great creating a quality do's that score me constant compliments!  Today, I think I found my steady though.  Oh Tommy...I love what you did to me! He really listened and gave me the cut I wanted and in quick time too!  I also come to Dolce for brow service ad facials.  They are always just right !  Now I'm hooked on gel nails!  Yes, they are pricier than a standard manicure, but oh my heavens, they are delightful.  It is so wonderful to put on my seatbelt and start my car without effing up the manicure that just sucked up 45 minutes of my precious weekend!     All the professionals are kind and if not genuine, they are convincing!  From the appointments girl, to the front desk, to the professionals and their assistants, everyone is friendly, courteous and engaging.  Finally, I'd like to point out my appreciation for the design, decor and all the marketing details.  There is nothing in this salon that screams half-ass or cheap.  All the details are in place giving the salon a classy feel.  The prices are fair...not outrageous for any city standards.  Plus, if you are a fan on FB or if you watch for Groupon deals, you can get some pretty sweet hookups.  Finding the right salon can be a challenge.  I really lucked out when the waitress at Ra Sushi a year ago recommended Dolce to me.  It's been a good experience!

I like this place quite a bit. It is clean and full of character. It's cool but not pretentious. Happy hour is good and the menu is great too!  They are connected to Churn so you can get your coffee and ice-cream fix as well!  Just be careful not to be seated by the window facing Central at the end of the day. The sun on your back will make you want to die.

There are 2 other Thai restaurants within walking distance.  They are both very good and have great service despite the lunch crowds.  Although I was promptly seated on a shot gun booth facing a wall that makes you feel completely cut off from the rest of the venue, the service was terrible!  I waited and waited for someone to help me.  I tried flagging down some help a couple of times.  At one point a waitress said she would send someone and never did.  Finally, I got my order in. Whew!  They brought me a bowl of coconut soup as part of the meal.  It was quite good.  My Pad Thai was delivered promptly albeit practically tossed at me.  I mean, I know they are busy...sort of...but it's lunch time in downtown...prepare for it!!  So, the food is actually pretty good,but not great.  The noodles were a little cold and sticky, but the flavor was still good.  After my meal, I waited and waited for my check.  Someone finally went to get it for me, but it seems that she forgot, so I'm waiting.  In the meantime, I changed my 2 stars to a 1 star.  I'll try once more to make sure this isn't a fluke, so...uhhhh...better luck next time!

This place is great for the person who wants to eat better but really doesn't have the time or know how to put together good and healthy meals!  The food is healthy, well proportioned, convenient and pretty yummy too.  You can eat there, grab & go or pick up meals for several days and the prices are reasonable.  The staff is super friendly and knowledgeable and will show you how it works with no pressure.   I just started the 21 day challenge.  Liz is my coach.  She spent a good hour asking me about my life style, goals and challenges and then she explained how it all works in terms that made sense and were motivating. Basically, its like this...Liz picks out everything that I'm going to eat during the challenge and even gave me a schedule for what time to eat.  All I have to do is pick up my meals 2X a week.  On top of that, Liz  will call me or email me daily to make sure I'm doing alright and to hold me accountable.  Also, if I'm in a situation where I can't eat My Fit Foods...like a client dinner or I'm traveling for work, Liz will help me with choices.  Seriously, she said that I can just tell her where I'm going and she'll figure it out.  Literally, I don't have to shop, cook or clean.  I don't have have to worry about making the right choice because all the right choices are being made for me.  I mean, I'm pretty sure that every excuse for not getting in to better habits has been obliterated.  Now, we'll just see if it works.

Asiana Sushi, welcome to the neighborhood.  I don't have big expectations when it comes to downtown lunch joints, so my standards for this review are not going to be as high as my standards for a dinner restaurant.  That said, I'm a fan.  While the sushi selection is limited the lunch options are great.  You can get a bento box, a sushi plate or one of the chef's specialty lunches at very reasonable prices.  I mean, the food isn't the best ever, but its pretty good.  The serving sizes are generous and the ticket will be in the $10 range.  I've been twice and the service both times has been just fine.  I'm sure that Asiana will be part of my normal work week rotation.
