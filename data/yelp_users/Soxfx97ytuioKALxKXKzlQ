I had this office as my Dermatologist for years... and I hadn't needed to visit in a few years (from the old office at Camelback).    This time it was extremely frustrating. I had my appointment, and I arrived on time and had to wait about 30 minutes. Got treatment and was told to come back for a follow up in a few weeks. When It was time to return I got an unexpected emergency at work and was running about 20 minutes late or so. I called and they said "no problem, just come down and it might take longer to see you but we will get you in".  I confirmed, since I had a 40 minute drive, and I told them I had a long drive. When I arrive they had me wait for a good 20 minutes, and THEN they tell me they can't see me that I was too late. So after loudly asking them to honor their first message to me (that they would see me) and them saying they didn't even know who had said that from their office, they just turned me away.  They made me waste nearly 1 hour and 30 minutes I didn't have, and now I need to see a different doctor for the thing they started treating, that wasn't successful.  To cap all of this, they sent me a $5 bill on the mail, no reference to everything else that happened.  So recap: the doctor is Ok, if you ever get to see her.  The techs are pleasant and didn't resolve my problem.  The office staff is incompetent in my experience.   No good having a doctor that you never get to see because of his/her staff!

Awful experience. Seems like no matter when you go its a LOOOONG wait. Nothing Urgent about this place. Waited for 2 hours, just to be told 'there are still people ahead of you'.  I'll just wait till Monday when anywhere else is open, the wait will probably be as long anyway.  Don't go here!

As a South American in Phoenix, I find there are few true South American restaurants that don't completely bend to Mexican food traditions...  So I was delighted to find a Reina Pepiada Arepa from my home Venezuela, and many other true South American dishes.  The service is a little slow, so don't go there if you are really hungry already or in a rush ... but well worth it. Will repeat!

Dont bother and go to Home Depot across the highway on Northern. These folks were a joke... I called and they quoted me a price on tile, twice. So I drive there and they tell me its 50% higher and that we had never talked on the phone about prices. Then I find another Lowe's that has the original lower price, and THEY can't talk to them to find that person or price. Then they finally give in (nor really acknowledge what I was saying but give in) I literally have to teach about percentages and basic math to the 'manager' of the store. What a Joke!

One of those truly unique places! Love the pulled pork(carnitas) and the emerald chicken, the black beans and fried rice are to die for... Nothing I've tried has let me down (a teriyaki quesadilla was just ok, but then I'm not a big teriyaki fan).

Friendly staff, great (and healthy) food, reasonable prices, specially for organic and glue free foods!  The only knock is that portions are on the small size, we have a teenage boy and he was left hungry...

Everything about this place is awesome. The food, the staff, the next door desert place (Nami -- sister store).  Have loved every dish. The "Crab" Puffs are to die for.  Any of their bowls have been superb. Can't find anything not to like about this place...  They even have a way above average bathroom.... :)

We found this through yelp, on a last minute whim and we LOVED IT. The staff was super friendly even when we walked in 3 minutes before close time. We got the breakfast burrito crepe, and my wife got the something-jack crepe (second on the menu) and the nutwlla anf bannana dessert crepe. Loved every bite of it!!! We were offered a homemade plantain with special seasoning. Again delicious...  The ambiance isn't all there,  but the food more than makes up for it.

One of our new favorite places to eat. I can't have enough of the Fried Crab Rice, and the orange chicken has a great light batter and our little one's favorite. Great friendly service too!

Made appointments to explore having invisilign. Picked my doctor (elsewhere) and these guys were one of the 4 I had a consult. Here are my thoughts: 1. Thieves! Only one out of 4 to charge for the consult 2. They did not disclose they would charge $175 for a 15 minute consult 3. They refuse to waive the charges and will charge my insurance for this -- at least its not out of pocket for me.  Stay away ... far, far away!

My wife and I enjoy coming. They usually have 2 or 3 good acts. And Rick Bronson himself is a big ball of energy! Decent food...  Great date night

Great place. Feels family owned. The food was great. The home made jelly was fantastic. I had a veggie omelet and they customized it no problem.  My 8 year old son even said "this place is even better than first watch" which is his favorite place to eat...
