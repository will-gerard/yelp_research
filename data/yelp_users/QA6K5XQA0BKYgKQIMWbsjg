This should be a no star review. Frontier has mastered the art of losing customers by nickle and diming them to death.  I will NEVER fly them again. I would pay more money on another airline just to not have to go thru this experience again. If you book on a third party website such as priceline you won't know about the extra charges such as the charge per checked bag per leg of the flight. You also won't know about the rules that if you don't check in at least two hours before your flight they will give your seats away. AND if you don't check your bags at least 45 minutes before your flight leaves they won't check your bags. We missed our 45 min cut off by 8 minutes. You can tell that the poor employees must just get screamed at for the majority of their shift because of the way they reacted towards us. After paying a 225 dollar rebooking fee for a flight 12 hours later and paying all the lovely bag fees our 500 dollar tickets turned into 1000 dollare tickets.  We then were blessed with the enertainment of watching people lose their minds at the gate over being told that their bags were too big to be a personal item and they were now going to be charged 60 dollars to bring their bag onboard. Frontier you can tell me all day long how "clearly" your policies are posted. Good for you. Enjoy my money that you squeezed out of me. It shall be the last of my money you shall ever see. I shall also make sure to let everyone I know about my experience and to NEVER fly your airline. I feel geniunely sorry for your employees who have to enforce your truly horrible policies.

My husband and I have shopped at this store before and we have always been happy. I had a situation in which my shoes from the Walking Company were no longer feeling good on my feet. The gentleman who had helped me before noticed that the shoes should not have broken down that quickly and took amazing care of me.   The only reason why I am not giving this store five stars is that they always seem understaffed for the traffic they get. You have to go in with some patience but it it's worth it.

There is always a long wait - on the weekend it can be three hours. We waited for an hour on a Wednesday night because I had never had chicken and waffles before. It was SO good! I loved it and so did the whole family. The chicken was so good and the waffles were tasty! I would definitely come back.

Great food and friendly staff! I had the Sun Devil Zone and it was tasty! There are lots of different options and I would definitely come back.

I have done escape rooms before and this one was by far the best! We had ages 10 to 72 and everyone was able to contribute and everyone had a wonderful time! Highly recommended.
