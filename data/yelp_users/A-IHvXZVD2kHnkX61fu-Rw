Really horrible customer service. Spoke to Nicole over the phone a few days to prior about group arrangements only to have her deny what she initially promised. She was extremely condescending and dishonest. Will be in touch with the "general" manager to follow up with how dissatisfied and disrespected we were.

It's inside the Chandler mall food court so I had low expectations but my shrimp tacos were delicious. Everything is made fresh so when you order they give you a little buzzer which I thought was weird for food court food but worth it. They have a salsa bar (like Moe's) and their salsa verde (I think that's what it was, the green one) was so good. It had a lot of cilantro which I love. I came back and ordered two chipotle ranch salads with grilled shrimp and they were pretty good but not as good as the tacos. Prices seem a little high but the quality of the ingredients are good and you can honestly taste that your food is made to order. I had a churro too, really good. We'll definitely be back.

In the words of Genuwine, "my whole life has changed. Since you came in, I knew back then. You were that special one. I'm so in love, so deep in loveeeee." Seriously, seriously, for real, for real - I never want another donut ever again. And they serve MILK, like, just milk to go with their donuts. This blew my mind and also warmed my heart because I'm one of those people who NEEDS milk with my desserts. I tried the maple donut (yes), the raspberry filled donut (sweet baby jesus yes), and the oreo-creme filled donut (no). That raspberry donut single-handedly changed my life and I only had a bite of the maple one but that was enough for me to realize that I HATE cake-like donuts, donuts are not supposed to taste like cake, they're donuts. The maple-donut was so airy and light and not doughy at all, Idk, it was perfect. My oreo donut was weird, I had to eat through  2/3 of it to get to the creme which was good but not 2/3 of donut chewing good. All in all, 9/10 - would krispy kreme again (and again, and again).

I ordered to-go and it's a nice sit down Chinese restaurant which is definitely different than the Chinese food places I'm used to in NY. Ordered their sesame chicken and was pretty much given little sweet and sour chicken pieces with a sweet glaze and a sprinkling of sesame seeds. The menu doesn't give the options to order pints or quarts and the rice was bland. I gave Golden Harvest two stars because it's the best of the two options in this area (I detest Panda Express) but I would not go back.

My fiance and I frequent Sonic a lot and mainly it's because she eats ice. Me being a "follower fiancee" I now eat ice too and Sonic has the best ice for eating. It's crushed up really small and it feels soft on your teeth as opposed to eating big ice cubes which feels terrible. Weirdness aside, I like Sonic. I feel like the food is kinda standard fast-food burger joint food with the exception of their Philly cheese steak and their tots but I really go there for the slushs. Blue coconut, ocean water, and cherry are my favorite. I recently tried the orange flavor (for breakfast, makes sense, right?) and it was good too but the flavor didn't last as long as the others. I even like their cream slushes which is just vanilla ice cream mixed into a slush - try it with cherry and thank me later. I think if you're looking for a nice cold slush or a "decadent" milk shake on the go, Sonic is a good place to stop. Oh but there whipped cream is more like Cool Whip so if you're like me and don't really like Cool Whip, leave it off.

Firstly, I make it no secret that I hate American Airlines. When I used to travel to Belize more often, EVERY TIME they would lose my luggage and I'd have to go back in the next few days once it was finally retrieved. Every. Single. Time. I haven't been to Belize in a while but my fiancé and I are in the process of moving to AZ and it's a pretty expensive ordeal. We went down to visit family and look for apartments and while we flew Jetblue down together, we both live in different states, so we flew home separately. Since her flight was so expensive I opted for a cheaper flight through Cheaptickets.com. The flight was pretty cheap but you get what you pay for because American Airlines sucks. I went against my better judgement and paid for it, hard. The lines to check my luggage were ridiculous and unorganized to start and once I got that done, there was almost no where to sit at my gate. So I find a seat, begin waiting for my flight - freaking delayed. Mind you, my fiancé had left two hours before me but we were supposed to arrive home about the same time. The flight was delayed an hour so whatever, what can I do, right? I charged my phone, look on social media, debate whether I want to lose my seat to get food, when I look again, DELAYED AGAIN. My flight was supposed to depart at 3:25pm and wasn't going to be leaving now until 5:30pm meaning I wouldn't make it home until after 1AM (eastern time) and I had to work the next day. Once I finally got on the plane, it was filthy. There were dirty tissues stuffed into the pocket of the seat in front of me and the seats were so small. The man next to me had to be maybe 120lbs and he was struggling. I dropped my headphones and because we were so cramped, I couldn't even bend to find them until he went to the bathroom (and I had spilled my soda on him). They gave us one drink and a little bag of pretzels for a 5+ hour flight and didn't even have TV's in the back of the seats. It was just a terrible flight. Then once we finally landed it took at least 45 minutes for the luggage to be unloaded and put on the carousel. Ridiculous! Thank God my dad had parked and came inside otherwise he would have been waiting in the car forever. If I can avoid it, I'll never fly AA again. No freaking thank you.

Funny story, I walked by this place the other day and mentioned to my fiancé that it must be gross since the sushi was only $2. I was wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong. I came here by myself the other day for dinner (it was a little after 6) and it was pretty empty which I liked. You're greeted by the hostess and told to sit wherever you want around the bar/conveyor belt with different types of sushi rolls, shrimp tempura, sesame balls, and other eats. I will say a lot of the rolls are just a different take on a California roll (Cali roll topped with avocado, Cali roll topped with salmon, etc.) but there's a little sign before each new roll that lets you know what it is. Some reviews mentioned that this wasn't the best quality sushi but I really liked it. And there's like 2-4 pieces of sushi per $2 plate depending on the side of the roll so you really get your money's worth. I paid about $20 for 7 plates of sushi, a drink, and tip (I didn't leave a huge tip since you serve yourself) and I ate like a king. I plan on making weekly sushi trips here since it's so close to my fiancé's job. The idea of good cheap sushi just excites me so much.

I enjoyed myself! My fiancé works in the same plaza and I mentioned to her that I wanted to try this place so a few nights ago she suggested we meet up there after she got off. On the outside and on the inside, it looks like a really nice restaurant like I'm new to the foodie game but I thought this place was pretty swanky. So imagine my surprise when I saw the menu and the prices - extremely, extremely reasonable. Like how TGIFriday's used to be before it got all snobby and overpriced on us. Maybe I'm just used to NY prices but nothing on the menu was over $14 if I recall correctly. The menu was typical American fare: burgers, sandwiches, salads, steak, seafood, and some pastas. We skipped the appetizer and my fiancé ordered the bacon cheeseburger. It was cooked well, tasted good, I really enjoyed her fries. They weren't too crunchy and they were seasoned well, not overly salty. I ordered the New Orleans pasta. The bread it came with was delicious (of course) and it wasn't too spicy to where my mouth was on fire. It was just enough. It had sausage, chicken, and shrimp. The chicken looked weird, like, I made my fiancé try it to make sure it was chicken and before she tasted it she assured me it was sausage and it wasn't. So chicken that looks like sausage was a little weird for me for it tasted good. I took half of it home and ate it for dinner the next day and it tastes even better. We ordered the monster cookie for dessert and we weren't really feeling it. It was like a chocolate chip butter cookie, it was brittle on the sides and didn't have a cookie taste or feel to it. They're made to order which was fine for us but we're BIG fans of the pizookie from BJ's and that was no pizookie. Overall, I would definitely go back. Our waiter, Mike, was so nice and his demeanor was cool as a cucumber, I bet he never gets mad, lol. Next time, however, I'll ride with my fiancé so that I can drink because that Painkiller drink looked delicious and the 2 per customer limit really has me intrigued.

First time getting my nails done here as well as Arizona and God no. The prices were the same, if not more, than NY prices which I didn't expect but gel polish was only $10 more so I went with it. They really nickle and dime you. It's $32 for a callus pedicure that they do a terrible job on and they state that you have a choice between three different scrubs but I was never even asked which one I wanted. I really should have just gone with the $19 regular pedicure because it looks as if I painted my nails at home but I had just come back from camping and wanted to treat myself. I initially wanted an entire new set but they acted as if they didn't want me to soak my nails off and didn't feel comfortable attempting the shape (coffin) that I had so I just got a fill-in. The service was decent, my nail technician made small talk and since I am trying to not come off as a rude New Yorker I did too but not I wish I hadn't because it seems as if she was distracted doing my nails because the gel polish is so thick and wavy. Not a smooth application at all. I let it go because I was just over it and I figured I would probably just have to drive into Phoenix to find a decent nail salon which I don't really have a problem doing since I take my nails very seriously but seriously, terrible job. I ended up breaking a nail and having to go back and they had the audacity to ask me where did I get my nails done because they looked so poorly done so imagine how dumb they felt when I had to let them know that the main nail technician did my nails and how I would have NEVER gotten gel polish if I thought it would have looked this way. They offered to redo the polish and were apologetic but I had to be somewhere and didn't really trust them to fix it. I won't be coming back.

I was really, really craving pasta and this place has been recommended to us by our backer. So we ended up ordering take out since we were babysitting that day, I ordered the dark Alfredo for me and the El Diablo shrimp pasta for my honey since she wanted shrimp. I ignored the "el diablo " part and assumed it would be about as spicy as the Cajun pasta at TGIFs - well, I was wrong. Completely and totally wrong. That El Diablo pasta was the hottest thing I've ever put in my mouth and I'm Belizean! The flavor was there but the heat was so intense. It was literally the best of times and the worst of times eating that damn pasta. The shrimp was good. The dark Alfredo was good too, considerably less spicy and flavorful but still good, I just wish I would hand ordered it with chicken or something. Overall really  good pasta at a decent price. Next time I'm hoping to actually dine in.

Good donuts, nice service but that pina colada smoothie was one of the grossest drinks I've ever had. Like, it must have been rotten or sour, it was terrible. I just threw it away because I didn't want to make a thing about it and I definitely didn't tell my MIL because she definitely would have made a thing about it, lol. It must not be something that gets ordered often and the girls that work here seem fairly young so I let it go. I came here for breakfast with my fiancé, my MIL, and her two grand nephews (or whatever) and we ordered a dozen donuts which was totally unnecessary but it gave me the opportunity to try a few flavors. I really liked the apple filled donut and the maple long john but the concept of a long john blows me because it's so huge you expect it to be filled with something... but it's not? It's not my thing but maple donut are new news to me and I'm here for it. They do have my favorite brand of chocolate milk which is nice. I'd go back for the donuts but not for a while because they're so rich, they're definitely something you only want to have every so often. But again, stay away from that smoothie.
