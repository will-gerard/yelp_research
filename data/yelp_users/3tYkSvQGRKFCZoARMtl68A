I went for an oil change because I had a coupon, called, made an appointment with no trouble. When I arrived, Randy greeted me and was very friendly, he said it would be about 30-45 minutes. Having been to a multitude of other service shops that always say that (and take much longer) I was prepared to wait it out for a while. My car was done in 25 minutes, granted I still had to pay so my total time there was about 35 minutes. I was very excited about this! I was told two things that were recommended to be done on my car but did not feel pressured to have the services performed right then and there or to schedule right away. I greatly appreciated the information and education they provided me in what I needed done. That in itself made me want come back!  Great service!! There was a large waiting room with 2 couches, regular chairs and a rocking chair, with separate mens & women's bathrooms (although I did not go into the bathroom). Based on being a first time customer, Apache Sands gave a great first impression and I plan to return for future services!! Hopefully the next visits I have are just as good as this one!

It seemed as if my battery was going to die soon so I went and had it checked out here. I believe the associate that helped me was Chris and basically he tested my battery but it wasn't reading. He said it had a bad cell and probably would die soon, he looked up my information and since the battery was still under warranty he replaced it with no cost to me. He was very helpful, informative and efficient which I appreciated.

Simply amazing!! Such a cute and comfortable diner makes me feel like I am back home in my small town! The food was really delicious and very large portion size! My boyfriend eats a ton and this place filled him up, also inexpensive. Although it's not a place you would drive by and think we should eat there it's definitely a hidden gem! Will be returning here! They serve breakfast all day and have homemade biscuits! Yuuum!!

I've used Levi twice now, once to change my locks on the house and the second time when a key was stuck in the door lock. If I ever need a locksmith again, he will be the first I call (and likely the only because he is very prompt, reliable, accountable, fast... you get the drift, no need to call anyone else). He quoted me over the phone and both times have been exactly what he quoted. I don't know what other locksmiths charge but given his ability to respond to urgent matters quickly is worth every penny. He is an extremely hard working man and clearly appreciated by his customers! Would highly recommend!

I took a bridesmaid dress to Hanna to get the bust and waist taken in (~$30). She did a wonderful job! I am very happy with her work and would return! She allowed herself a 2 week time frame but finished early! Hanna was very friendly and welcoming! I originally found several good review of her elsewhere! I would return if I needed another alteration.

Who knew this little gem was in East Mesa! Such a fun country bar and Wednesday night brings in quite the crowd... $0.50 beers?! I thought they only did that in college towns. The crowd is diverse.. making it comfortable for anyone to go and have a good time. There is a big dance floor and a good number of seats in addition to other open areas, so there is room to breath when it starts to get busier later in the night. Even if you are not a dancer it's fun to watch and enjoy some cheap drinks.. but let's face it you'll find at least one dance partner by the time you leave. This place is worth checking out at least once!

It was my first time buying a home and I was pleased with the House team. For someone who knew nothing about the home buying process or lending, Jeremy took the time to sit down and walk me through pretty much everything which I was thankful for. The team does great work, they stay on top of everything and guide you through each step. Email communication is a little excessive but I'd rather that than nothing at all. Thanks for your service!

GO TO APPLE! It's cheaper ($140 tax included for iPhone 6s new screen), faster, you get an apple product and excellent customer service.   I take my first review back two fold.. In order to get the 10% off I had to write the review right then and there. So it was true at the moment, I had a fixed screen. I walked out the door, started using my phone & noticed some glitches, the phone worked but the glitches were annoying enough that I wanted it fixed since I paid $170. Went back and had the screen replaced again.. Walked out the door, used the phone a little and same exact problem, a glitch on the left side and malfunctioning touch. Walked right back into the store and they said we don't have anymore screens we'll have to order another.. Okay fine. I went out of town and when I returned came back to get the new screen... Finally it worked without any issues.... (For 15 minutes) I got home and the screen was completely black.... I couldn't access anything on my phone because it was black.. Thank goodness for iMessage & other Apple products, after all my trips to this place I had Steven's number so contacted him immediately. My phone is crucial for work so to not have it functioning was problematic, at least the previous 2 defective screens were usable. Steven said I'll be there at 9am the next day, I said me too. He didn't show up until 9:30. He didn't have any more black screens so offered to put a white one on.. I needed a working phone so said fine... After seeing it.. It was just unacceptable.. It's a black phone, a white screen does not match the black button. And I also thought whenever I get a new phone through my cell provider they would question me and I did not want to deal with that either. I asked for some sort of compensation or refund for the frustration and hassle I had been through. I gave them MULTIPLE opportunities to make this right since I paid for this service and the customer service was lacking. Do what you can to make your customers happy and stop blaming the manufacturers, you put 3 DEFECTIVE screens on my phone then a white screen..... And all you could do after talking to the "owner Mike" from the other location (who told me Steven was the owner of this store) was offer me a refund and to put my shattered screen back on my phone.......   I learned my lesson the VERY hard way.. Who knows where they are purchasing their parts from and how reliable & functional they are. I don't know how I was so unlucky to get 3 defective screens in a row but I guess I just saved 3 other people from this hassle. 4 trips, 4 screens to end up back at square one with my shattered screen (that I was so happy to have back & worked flawlessly besides the shattered display) I was very worried Apple wouldn't work on my phone since a 3rd party had tampered with it, but luckily with all my original parts there was no issue. Whatever you decide to do, do not lose that receipt...   One last thing.. After contacting a few other "repair shops" quotes on iPhone 6s screen repair was $175-$200 (tax not included), one shop advised I just go to Apple, if only I listened...
