I initially loved living at Arcadia Cove but that soon changed.  The BRE staff was always attentive and helpful when I had a problem and maintenance was prompt with all requests.  The complex was recently sold to MEB Management and things have gone downhill.  The new staff acts like I am bothering when I come to the office to pick up a package or drop off my rent.  The last office visit I had the office staff chase me down to my car to confront me if I had paid my water bill yet this month.  I had paid my water bill and she would have seen if she had looked at my account instead of coming after me in front of future tenants.  The units themselves are spacious and laid out well, the downstairs apartments have wood laminate flooring to give them a modern feel.  The main problem is the walls are VERY thin.  I can hear conversations from my downstairs neighbors like I was in their apartment. I have had to call the courtesy patrol numerous times because of neighbors playing their music and movies so loud it shook the pictures off my wall.  The pipes also make so much noise that I wake up most nights from my neighbor flushing their toilet.  I live in a one bedroom and usually pay between $25-35 a month for water/sewer/trash.  I understand they use a calculation of building occupancy vs total property water usage but this is more than I have ever paid even when I lived in a 2 bedroom.  Between the thin walls, rude new front office staff and that the total cost to rent is getting pretty high, I will be looking to move elsewhere when my lease is up.

People always wonder why I spend $$$ on quality sunglasses vs buying them from the knock-off kiosk in the mall.  Optical Shops of Aspen proves my point.    I have been a customer of theirs for years because of quality and customer service.  If I lose my case, they give me a replacement free of charge.  I have had my frames bent from an accidental drop onto cement.  They were able to repair them, at no charge, and saved me a ton of money on replacing them.    The associates are always helpful and I have never felt that they were pushing a different brand on me just to make more commission.  Love this place!

I have a love hate relationship with LGO.  I LOVE their food!  I hate that I never know if they are doing counter service only or if they have servers in the dining area.  I LOVE their pizza!  I hate their parking and now they've turned all their lot spaces into "19 min only" parking so you have to valet.  I LOVE their take and go options as well as you can buy wine at retail price in the grocery and drink it in the dining room with no corking fee.  I hate that this is a place that attracts hipsters.  My go to order item is a cheese pizza with extra cheese but don't doubt me until you try it.  They also have great salads and a lot of options for my veggie loving friends.  Things have been a little different since they separated with Tami Coe/MJ Bread but their red velvet cake, English muffins and other bakery items are still spot on.  But sadly there is no replacement for the MJ pretzel stick that stole my heart.

I went here on a Sunday afternoon at 1 PM to get a mani pedi before a trip.  I was promptly seated in a chair and then forgotten about for 30 minutes.  I am all about letting my feet soak but 30 minutes?  I was a prune by the time my nail tech got to me.  There were around 8 nail techs in the salon but they were all focused on 2 ladies and their 6 kids to wait on anyone else.  When my tech finally got to me, my pedicure lasted 15 minutes from start to final polish.  My tech didn't realize I wanted a manicure as well and took off to the next client.  I had to flag him back down and got a 5 min manicure.  He did do a great job on my buff but my cuticles were ragged and it was very haphazard.  They also only accept cash but have an ATM in the store incase all you have is a debit card.  The place was clean and had a lot of polish choices but definitely lacked on customer service.  If you are busy, take down my name and I will happily come back in an hour when you aren't as busy, don't let me sit with my feet in a bath for a half hour while you do polish changes on 5 yr olds.

My friend and I decided to meet up on Sunday to catch up and decided on Postino's because of their day time drink specials and their Sangira Sunday deal.  I know they are a busy place so I went a few minutes early to grab a table since my friend was driving from N Scottsdale.    The Hostess was friendly and told me it would be a 15 min wait for a table so I headed to the bar to grab a drink.  15 minutes pass and I see others that came in after me being seated.  20 minutes pass and I ask the hostess how much longer it would be.  She told me that she couldn't seat me because the rest of my party hadn't arrived yet.  I said yes I am waiting on 1 other person but I came early to get a table while she drove down.  The hostess told me they were busy and can't let people just hold tables all day for their friends.  She rudely said she would seat me now since I complained and lead me over to 2 lounge chairs with 2 wobbly end tables pushed together to make a table.  The idea was cute but made for an awkward eating experience since I was leaning forward and bending down to enjoy eating my lunch.  I had specifically asked for a table so I wasn't sure if we got seated at this table because I had complained as there were other more eating friendly tables available.  The whole ordeal was very off putting so my friend and I stayed for a bit and then went to another restaurant

I try to like you Postinos, I really do but you make it so hard.  Came on a Tuesday for their 8 PM $20 Bottle of wine and bruschetta special and left disappointed and annoyed.  The parking lot disaster strikes again!  LGO now put up signs saying 25 min parking for LGO customers only and has a lot monkey stationed to chase away people trying to park in those spaces.  I was told by the lot monkey that I could valet ($3 charge) or I could park 3 blocks away if I didn't want to pay the fee.  Keep in mind this is a Tuesday and I have to pay to park my car because the restaurant blocks off all the spaces.  Once seated my friend and I tried to catch up for a moment when the server came over to take our drink orders.  Since we had just sat down we asked for some time to take a look at the menu.  Our server came back a few minutes later and asked if we were ready to order.  No suggestions on a wine, no questions if we had questions, just "you ready to order?"  We ordered a bottle and bruschetta and our waiter disappeared.  For the rest of the night.  I watched him refill wine glasses at other tables, ours was brought by another server.  Other tables had their plates cleared when they were finished, ours sat in front of us until another server took them away.  Our server obviously didn't want our business because about an hour after we sat down he came back to the table and asked if we were interested in any dessert.  We said no and he immediately dropped the check on the table and left.  No offer of another round of drinks, just here is your check.  The wine we had was amazing and was a steal at the price plus the bruschetta.  The bruschetta themselves were half assed.  3 of the 4 weren't even sliced all the way through but over all they were decent.  Yet again Postinos shows they want my money but not my patronage.  I don't understand how I am the only one who keeps having horrible experiences here?

People always judge me because I go to the "ghetto" Fry's but seriously they do a great job.  Everyone is always so helpful and courteous to me and since the remodel the store has done a 180.  They have also increased their food selection since the remodel which is great.  The part I love best about this store are the cashiers!  Always friendly and talkative and they are definitely characters!  It is refreshing to have someone talk to you as a person instead of just reading your name off VIP card receipt.

Wish I could review this place on service but I wasn't able to get one.  Walked in at 1 PM on a Sunday afternoon for a mani pedi, was told by the front nail tech to have a seat.  I get it, I walked in on a Sunday afternoon so they are going to be busy and I am fine to wait.  My wait turned into 30 minutes and no one said a word to me.  Then the front nail guy tells me it is going to be another 20 minutes before someone would be able to get to me.  You know your salon, you know your techs and how long it will take them to do a service as well as how many people are in front of me so it would have been nice to have gotten a expected wait time before I wasted an hour my time.  I ended up leaving and going to another salon who saw me right away    The place in general was dirty, nail polish spilled down the wall and dust everywhere.  I did not get to see how clean their pedi baths and chairs were but the front waiting and front desk area was filthy.

The boy and I were celebrating our one year anniversary so we decided to try The Melting Pot.  I made reservations through Open Table (Yay!) indicating it was our Anniversary so they would be aware it was a special occasion.  When we arrived we were told it would be a 10 min wait, even though I had made a reservation weeks in advance.  We headed to the bar to get a drink where we were promptly ignored by the bartender who was more concerned about cleaning plates than taking our drink order.  One of the two bartenders asked the other one to grab our order but she too, ignored us during our obligatory 10 min wait.  We went to our table empty handed.  The hostess was sweet but was a bit ditzy and wouldn't make eye contact with us.  She asked if we were celebrating anything special that night and we informed her it was our anniversary.  She asked us "what kind of anniversary?"  Ummm?  Our server brought us water but was slow to take our drink order, by this time we had been in the building for 25 min without anything from the bar.  Our server was helpful to navigate the menu and gave us recommendations of what she liked, and how to cook the food.  The table situation was another big miss.  We were seated right next to the server station and were treated to their loud antics the entire night.  Every time someone walked by, which was a lot, they said "corner" and later one server broke into a loud rendition of "Somewhere Over the Rainbow".  We also had several staff ask us if it was a special occasion throughout the night.  I had made a note of it on our Open Table reservation, had told the hostess, so by the time the 4th person asked us, it was beyond awkward.  The hostess came around mid-meal and asked us if we wanted out picture taken with no explanation other than "would you like your picture taken?"  Fortunately we over heard her tell another table that they do complimentary pictures that are uploaded to their FB page.  It was a nice touch, but very odd without any explanation.  I do want to give kudos to the bus boy with the man bun who escorted me to the rest room when I asked for directions.  While the food was ok, the service and experience was very lack luster for the final bill amount.  For a special occasion we felt put out and put up with.  On our way out I noticed nice romantic tables that had a curtain to block out the rest of the restaurant that we were not offered to us.  Maybe the "Somewhere over the rainbow" song was a special occasion package I wasn't aware of.

I don't like writing bad reviews so I will keep this one short and to the point.  We had never been to Arrivederci and had purchased a Groupon deal to use.    When our bill came, I noticed we were charged full price for all items we had ordered when we should have been charged Happy Hour price for some.  Our server said that since we used a Groupon, we had to be charged full price for ALL food.  I was confused why I was being charged full price for Happy Hour items, I am aware Groupon can not be used to pay for discounted items (Happy hour) but we had ordered $60+ worth of regular priced menu items which was more than the Groupon Value.  Our server clarified that if anyone uses a Groupon, the owner mandated that every item ordered be charged at FULL PRICE, regardless if the Groupon value had already been met by other items.  She also confirmed it was because "the owner needs to make up the cost of running the Groupon so we have to charge at full price.  The deal is so good, you shouldn't mind being charged full price."  We were over charged by $15 because of me using a Groupon.  The experience left a bad taste in my mouth and I doubt we will come back because of it.  Hope the extra $15 was worth it for you, Owner.

I now know what my scalp looks like, and you can to!  I came to Aveda to purchase a few items and did not leave disappointed.  I have been an avid Aveda user for years and normally order products through their website but I had a birthday gift offer being a Pure Privlidge Program member.  I was warmly greeted and offered a glass of Aveda tea while the sales associate finished up assisting another customer.  I didn't get her name (and my receipt only says KS) but the associate who helped me was knowledgeable and fun.  She offered me a ritual (hand massage, shoulder massage, scalp massage, make up finishing touch, skin care, or Pure-Fume application) as well as a complimentary scalp analysis.  She also checked my hair for damage and dryness and made some recommendations based on her findings.  The associate also helped me chose between a few different products and sent me home with some samples of products she recommended from my scalp analysis.  My birthday gift was amazing, my choice of a 30 mL sample one of their Composition oils ($23 value).   Many people see Aveda's price tag and shy away but I encourage you to try their products, you will become a believer.  I will definitely be back to this location for my Aveda needs, the staff was amazing and extremely helpful.

The 5 star review is for their Service Department.  I own a Chevy Cobalt which unfortunately has had to have a lot of recall work done on it.  I received another notice in the mail of more work to be done and the offer of a free oil change.  I scheduled my service through their online system and received a confirmation email that they would contact me if anything changes.  Easy peasy.   I dropped of my car and Scott identified himself as my point of contact.  Unfortunately, I did not bring the letter from GM with me that had the promo codes for the free oil change.  Scott told me he would see what he could do and confirmed when I was coming back for the car to make sure the department would still be open.  I received a VM from Scott later that day telling me the repair work went beautifully, they were able to change my oil without the voucher code, and even did a tire rotation for me!  Included with the complimentary tire rotation was a tire tread analysis of my tire life.  The best part?  They ran my car through the carwash free of charge.  I previously had used Freeway Service when I lived in Ahwatukee but after I moved away, I went to several other dealerships and had bad experiences.  This experience reminded me why I loved Freeway and why I was so loyal to their service department.  Keep up the great work!  The rest of this review is for their sales team, which was very high pressure for me and deserves one star.  Around 20 min before I received the VM from Scott about my recall repair work, I received a VM from another Freeway employee stating he needed to speak to me about my car.  Thinking he was a service rep and maybe something else was wrong with my car, I returned his call and had him ask me if he could have 10 min of my time when I came to pick up my car and to ask specifically for him.  After that I received the call from Scott telling me my recall work went "beautifully/smoothly" so I knew it was a sales call and had nothing to do with the status of my car.  When I was dropped off that evening to pick up my car, the lot was lined with sales people.  I was barely out of the car when someone approached me and I said I was there for service.  He then asked if I was ready to trade my car in and upgrade to something newer.  There were so many visible salespeople milling about in the lot, The Boy was afraid to leave me there like a lamb to the slaughter.  While I was EXTREMELY pleased with the service work,I was very disappointed with the sales division and their high pressure approach.  I appreciated being treated like a valued customer, not as a $$$ sign as soon as I walk on the lot.

This 1 star review is for the sales team.  STOP CALLING ME!  STOP TEXTING ME!  I have in no way indicated I am interested in trading in my car and indicated that when I picked up my car after my recall work, yet I keep getting calls from your sales team.

I would like to start off this review by stating I have never been the only one to apologize for a bug in my drink but now I am going to lose that one in a game of "Never Have I Ever".  My friends and I came here for Happy Hour last Thursday after work to blow off some steam, have a few drinks, and some cheap eats.  Kona has a GREAT happy hour for food and the fact they run it until 7 is amazing, no rushing to get an order in before 6 PM.  The drinks are just so so, I enjoy a $5 margarita but when I have three of them and feel the same as when I had zero of them, it makes me want to pay full price just to get a strong drink.  Our visit started out well enough until I noticed there was a fruit fly in my freshly delivered Margarita.  The restaurant has an open air bar which means fruit fries can be a problem, it's a common problem, I get it.  We flag down our waitress and I apologized and point out the bug.  She said "Ok" and walked away.  I looked at my friends, was I the only one to apologize about a bug in my drink?  I didn't expect her to grovel but at least acknowledge it happened.  This should have been a sign.  New drink was brought out and all is well so we order some items off the happy hour menu.  Here comes problem # 2, our food arrives but there is only 1 set of silverware at the table.  We stare at our food until our waitress comes over to ask how things are tasting.  We ask for silverware and she stops at 3 other tables before she brings it out to us while we continue to sit and stare at our food.  Once she comes back with silverware, I have to ask for chopsticks and soy sauce, which should have been brought out anyways since 2 of the 3 of us has ordered sushi.  This time she made an annoyed guffaw as she walked away like it was my fault she didn't think to bring us sushi accompaniments.  Our food was good and was decent for the discounted price.  I noticed I did not receive one of my HH food items but since our waitress didn't write down our order, or seemed to notice it was missing from the table, I figured maybe she didn't hear me when I ordered it.  We asked for the check and I saw I had been charged for the item but never received it, and pointed this out to the waitress.  She seemed to understand and took all of our cards to run payment.  We watched as she carried the books with our cards under her arm pit as she checked on her other table.  I'm not paranoid about identity theft, but then again I don't like when my credit card takes an unplanned stroll through the restaurant.  She returned with our cards and I thought was going to thank us for coming but she started to lay into me about the missing item.  She blamed ME for it saying "Next time this happens, you need to tell me earlier otherwise I don't know that it didn't come out."  I apologized (again) saying we all make mistakes and I didn't know if she had heard me when I ordered it, which is why I waited for the bill to come in case it hadn't been rang in.  You know, no harm no foul.  Evidently this wasn't an acceptable response (yes, yes the bug and this dish not making it out of the kitchen, all my fault) and she said "The kitchen makes the same dishes over and over during happy hour and they have no way of knowing if they missed a dish on the ticket.  You should have said something earlier and I could have fixed it."  After all this, I felt like that "David After the Dentist" kid, is this real life?  Will we be back to Kona? For happy hour, yes.  I just hope our waitress will be working at her other serving job that day so I can save my apologies.

Got a group of friends together for a Saturday night and thought HBJ's would be a great place to cut loose.  The restaurant is set up with long tables all picnic style but it worked for us.  Our waitresses were AMAZING and deserve a 5 star rating, kept separate tabs for all of us, handled a group of 12 with ease.  The food was so so but the place is meant to be a country bar so I can understand food isn't their priority.  My low review is based on the owner.  After dinner, we all wanted to mingle a bit and asked if we could take the large high top table right behind us.  I asked if we could keep part of our dinner table just in case someone wanted to sit and our waitress said ok.  Five minutes later an old lady came over and asked if we were keeping our dining table.  I said we didn't need the entire table but wanted to keep some chairs in case we wanted to sit.  The old lady slapped me on the back and told me she was the owner and was going to "kick me out" for asking to keep our table.  Then she abruptly walked away.  I was very confused but a few moments later she went up to another member of our group and threatened to kick them out too!  Turns out she wanted to seat a group of her regulars at our table (even though I had called ahead and made a reservation).  It was very clear she didn't want our business so we paid, tipped our server well and left.  Probably won't go back either.

I have been going to Mikhail for almost 7 years now which is the longest I have stayed with one man in my life. :)  Mikhail is so talented in his craft that I really don't bring in pictures of what I want anymore.  I just sit in his chair, give him an idea (keep the length but I want more movement) and say "work your magic" and he does!  In our time together so far I have had long layered hair as well as many variations of the "Posh Spice" bob and I have always been happy.  He takes the time to look at your face and bone structure and then creates a perfect cut based on that.  I also love their online booking system which really helps streamline booking your appointment.  I constantly get compliments on my hair and even had a lady chase me down in Trader Joes to ask where I get my hair cut.  Mikhail deserves 10 stars out of 5!

I really don't understand all the great reviews or the $ rating for price as I got none of that.  The bagel I had was ok nothing to write home about, maybe I would have liked a bialy but there wasn't anything to explain to me what the difference between the two is.  The bagel was reasonably priced at $1.29 but the schmear of Cream Cheese set me back $3!  Just regular cream cheese, nothing fancy cost me $3.  Just butter is a $2 up charge.  So now I am in $4.29 for a bagel and cream cheese.  I also ordered a small Cesar salad which was another disappointment.  I don't know what their idea of Cesar dressing is but it just tasted like they poured oil and vinegar and some crunch cheese on my salad.  No other flavors besides oil and vinegar so it was not appetizing at all.  It was so oily looking that my breakfast companion noticed and asked about it. I ate two bites before I had to push it away.  My total for a small cesar, the bagel and cream cheese and a medium iced tea came to $13.  At first I thought maybe I had been double charged for something but in the end I realized that their prices were just that overpriced.  The odd part is their menu is on cupboard doors behind the cook line which doesn't sound like that big of a deal but the owner kept opening them to look for stuff and then would leave the door open and walk away.  I was trying to figure out what I wanted to order but at any given time half the menu was facing the opposite direction from me.  Maybe all the great reviews come from their regulars who can put up with this kind of crap.

Every summer, the Gypsies would come to our little town to set up shop and sell their wares. which included pillow cleaning and re-ticking. Since Phoenix seems to have a shortage on Gypsies, I have had a hard time finding places who clean and refresh feather pillows until I stumbled across Rave.  I dropped them off and was told it may take a week or so for my 2 standard pillows to be cleaned.  Cool, no problems there!  They also offer mail service for people living outside of the PHX area.   I got a call that my pillows were done and they are great!  Nice and soft, double lined with 100% Egyptian Cotton shells to prevent mites and feather puncture.  Each pillow also has a tag with a cleaned date so I know when to get them cleaned again which is a nice touch.  Also included was a tag receipt #, so I know it is my pillow, and a pass for harmful substances test tag.  The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is their website listed a Standard Down and Feather Mix pillow at $37.50 but I was charged $42.50 for each of my pillows.

Saw the reviews on yelp and thought I better check out what all the stars were all about.  I went for a regular Pedicure ($19 to start) on a random Tuesday afternoon.  It is your typical strip mall nail salon but was very clean and nice inside.    I was greeted by the techs and had no wait to get my pedi and boy what a pedi it was!  My nail tech was very nice and talkative.  She wore gloves and used the blue powder to sanitize the bath.  She asked if I wanted my nails cut and filed instead of just buzzing through with the scuff file.  I opted for the sea salt add on for $5 and she literally massaged my legs with the sea salt for 10 minutes!  The sea salt was a nice quality, wasn't too coarse and didn't burn my legs since it sat on them for a while.  My nail tech had a waxing appointment come in about  1/2 way through so another tech took over.  He was very nice and polite but his leg massage was out of this world.  He worked on my pressure points on the bottoms of my feet as well as my calf muscles.  Another ten minute massage on top of the ten min sea salt massage!  My pedicure was $24 with the sea salt but they start at $19.  They also gave me a rewards card for a free service after you have so many mani/pedi's done.  My ONLY gripe is that their colors were very dated but I bring my own polish with me so very easy to bypass that problem.  This is my new go to spot for nails!  Please please please open a Magen II a little closer to Scottsdale :)

We stopped by Mor on our quest for the perfect dining table and bedroom set.  While we didnt find what we were looking for, we still had a great experience.  One of the sales people was extremely helpful, talked to us like people and not like a sale, and really made the whole experience.  The store itself is a bit odd.  There is a "sweet" smell throughout the store.  We weren't the only ones who noticed as another couple commented it smelled like "fruit loops".  Maybe switch the type of deodorizer to a more neutral scent?  The TV's hanging from the ceiling playing Music Videos from the 90's didn't fit into a furniture store vibe either.

This review is for their lunch menu and service.  I work down the street from this location and needed time away from the office so myself and a coworker came here for lunch.  My coworker and I decided to split an appetizer and then order separately off their lunch menu.  Their fried calamari was good, but the portion seemed small for the $10 price.  Our Waitress also brought the plate out and then left without bringing us appetizer plates.  Thankfully she returned, our app came out quickly and she didn't have time to grab plates but it was sad none of her fellow servers helped to run her food.      My coworker ordered the endless soup with a bowl of pasta while I chose the endless salad and Italian Mac and Cheese.  We had bad timing with our order and they were making another batch of Minestrone soup but our waitress was kind enough to bring a salad plate to allow my coworker to share my salad while he waited.  Our pasta came out quickly and although it was described as a "Mini bowl", the portion was very small.  The Italian Mac and cheese came with bacon (which was never described on the menu) but all I could taste was fake Smokey flavor.    My coworker finally got his bowl of soup but here is the problem with endless, someone has to bring you more for it to be endless and by now our server had disappeared.  When she did return, she never acknowledged his empty bowl or offered him a refill.  She was prompt to drop the check (incorrectly split, btw) halfway through our meal and mentioned it again while we were still eating.  I am sure she was trying to be prompt as we were on a lunch break, but it made us feel rushed.  My salad and very small pasta was $8 + tax and over all, wasn't worth it.  The portion size vs the quality of the food vs the cost just wasn't there.  Our server had some hits and many misses but the misses could have been resolved with help/team work from her fellow servers.

Hate the wait, hate the prices but I love the Breakfast Club!  The food is amazing and the menu is extensive for plain old breakfast food.  The portions are large which is great if you are starving or hung over but I wish they had some of their larger items like the omelets ala cart.  I love their a la cart breakfast sandwich, it's like an adult egg McMuffin with horseradish sauce on it.  I don't love the price.  At over $5 for just a sandwich I'll head to across the canal to Olive and Ivy's market and get a sandwich and home fries for $7.  And if you like pancakes?  O....M....G!  I have found a couple things there that aren't wallet busters if you just want a quick bite to eat.  Their 2 eggs anyway are $2, spend $0.50 to add cheese and you have a filling but cheap meal for under $3.  The portion size is more like 3-4 eggs instead of two when you get them scrambled.  If you want to look at the menu ahead of time, don't bother with their online one.  It's out dated and most of their items have risen in price $1-3.  The other bad news is they don't have an alcohol licenses so no mimosas or bloody mary's with your breakfast.  Womp Womp :(

Fluff and Fold, you complete me!!  I haven't used their do it yourself area but I do take advantage of their fluff and fold service and it is amazing.  They charge $1 per pound (most loads are under 7 lbs) and wash, dry and fold your clothes.  They provide the detergent and will ask if you prefer fabric softener or even bleach on your whites.  Their Fluff and Fold hours are different from the do it yourself hours so you do need to plan ahead when you can drop off/pick.  They offer pick up services too but I live close enough I can drop off my laundry myself.  I brought in 3 weeks worth of laundry for $22+ tip.  They fold most items and hung up my perm press items on hangers.  I would recommend this place to anyone who doesn't have their own washer/dryer or anyone who hates to do laundry.  Def worth it!!

I LOVE this place!  Their prices have risen a bit to $2.25 but that is for ANY type of garment.  Other places charge your $15-20 to dry clean a dress but this place is $2.25 straight across the board.  They offer same day service too for the unbelievable price of $2.25!!!  I was so surprised when I asked for same day service that they didn't jack up the price but when they say they have a fixed price list, they mean it!!  The only (minor) negative is that you have to pay when you drop off the items so if you have 30 items to be cleaned, make sure you have the $$ before you head in there.

I lived here from 2008-2010 and did genuinely enjoy my experience with the apartment itself.  The building is old construction which was nice because I didn't have an issue hearing my neighbors.  Also didn't have a big issue with the heat/cold as the place was well insulated.  The location is also great as you are close to Old Town and the 101.  The issues I did have were with the management company.  Rent is due by the 2nd and HAS to be paid online.  The office doesn't tell you that it has to be paid by 12 AM Central Standard time otherwise you will get a $50 late charge.  I incurred a late charge and asked the office to reverse it since I had paid rent on time but was told since it was paid at 12:05 AM on the 3rd CST, they would not reverse the charges.    At first when I moved in there were around 4 washers/dryers for 40 units.  The laundry room was remodeled and the washer/dryers were reduced down to 2 units each.  The explanation was that the new models were "higher efficiency" and would be much faster but just because the wash cycle is faster doesn't mean your neighbor will be courteous and remove their laundry on time.  The worst part was I had someone steal my underwear on 3 separate occasions.  When I called the office to report it I was told "maybe you should just stay with your laundry so that people don't steal your personal items."  It was only after the 3rd time that I filed a police report and found out that the SDPD had had SEVERAL complaints about this issue and the office chose to over look them.     I also had issues with people parking in my assigned space and even had a glove box full of "nasty grams" to put on the offenders windshield.  One time I called the # listed on the carport to have the car towed and was told I needed a special "code" to have them come out.  I called the office and asked for the code and was told they don't give that out to residents but I could call during office hours and they would be happy to help with my parking issue.  I explained it was happening at 11 PM and the office wasn't open but was told to just find an uncovered spot to park in.  The kicker was when I moved out.  I had lived in the apartment for 2 years and did my best on upkeep.  Once I moved out I got a bill saying I owed them $200 over other $200 refundable deposit I had put down when I moved in.  I asked for an itemized list of what I was charged for and found out I was charged $180 to repaint my 500 sq foot apartment which I found odd since there were no holes in the wall nor had I made any paint color changes.  Was also charged to replace the carpet which was funny because it wasn't new when I moved in, just shampooed.  Oh yeah, dumpster divers totally true.  Happened at least once a week

The Boy took me to Don and Charlie's for my yearly anniversary of NOT getting older and we really enjoyed our experience!  Don and Charlie's has a lot of charm as that neighborhood restaurant where you take your family or meet your buddies after golf.  The menu is easy to navigate and reminded me of home (yay Midwest!). We decided on an appetizer, the onion strings, which was delicious and MASSIVE.  The two of us barely made a dent in it.    The Boy felt like ribs and I was feeling steak so he ordered a full rack with the Southwest Sauce and I got the NY with Parmesan crust.  The Boy LOVED the ribs and raved about the Southwest sauce so much that he has mentioned it several times since the visit and even talked about going back and seeing if he could buy a pint.  I ordered the Deli style cole slaw, a must if you like vinegar and mustard but was just ok with the Parm Crusted steak.  It was good but I felt like the steak had enough flavor that it didn't need the parm coating.  Our server was delightful, attentive, and very helpful when navigating the menu.  She even surprised me with a piece of their delicious chocolate cake for my birthday!  I mean, ummm, my special occasion.  Everything about our visit was amazing and we look forward to coming back!  One tip, use valet due to the many clubs in the area as well as the new residents being built across the street.

I've been coming here for a few months now to get a blow out for special events or just when I am feeling lazy.  At $10 you can see why I call it my guilty pleasure!    The salon is a bit noisy and the music does change daily depending on who picked the station so if you are looking for relaxation you may want to look elsewhere.  BUT if you are looking for a quick 'do, mani/pedi or a cheap cut then this is your place.  The bad news is you have to get there early because they take their last appointments at 2 PM and I don't believe they are open on the weekends.  I have not had a hair cut there but all the stylists I have had so far have been knowledgeable, personable and listened to what I asked for.  Many of the student stylists are close to graduating so you shouldn't feel worried that they are fresh out of haircutting 101.  My only gripe, as with any salon I go to is smokers.  Nothing ruins my style experience worse than a stylist whose hands smell like cigarettes.  It is a bit of a younger crowd that works in the salon but you can't fault them for having a trendy or punk look as long as they deliver the style you are looking for.

Came here for dinner and was not disappointed!  Our server Danyella was attentive and also very helpful.  The hostess made sure to ask if we were celebrating a special event (just the celebration of eating) and Danyella also checked about the occasion so she could make it memorable.    We each got the prime rib which was cooked nicely but the cut was very thin for being a 10 oz portion.  My piece actually looked ragged like there was some issue when it was sliced off the roast.  They also do more of a reduced au ju instead of the liquid version which was just ok. Another disappointment was they were out of the Scallops and Bacon appetizer on a Wednesday.  Danyella was helpful to recommend some other app options but we had our hearts set on the scallops.  My companion was in the mood for a brownie Sunday but was ready to go home.  Danyella was nice enough to box it up to-go for us and was prompt with the bill so the ice-cream wouldn't melt before we got home. Overall a nice experience with some food hick ups but will definitely be back!

Conflicted on this review but I am going to stick to my guns.  I am a HUGE fan of Papago beers and love that they have 25-30 on top plus 7682763 beers (not actual number) in bottles that you can drink there or take home.  It is extremely loud inside which some nights can be tolerable but if you get a table of guys shouting at each other it can be distracting if you are looking to hang with friends.  My meh review comes from the food.   Their menu has a lot of variety and everyone loves pizza right?  I ordered the Pretzel which itself was amazing, just the right amount of chewy and fluffy.  The cheese sauce it came with did nothing for the dish.  I also ordered the California BLT salad and here is where more disappointment came in.  I ordered the  1/2 size which was a huge portion but it really did disappoint.  The avocado slices on the salad were not ripe and were rock hard.  The diced chicken was so bland and dry it tasted like it had been boiled.  The worst part was the bacon.  It was clearly the kind of pre-cooked, thin sliced bacon you can buy in the store.  The whole thing was pretty half assed with ingredients that aren't that difficult to make.  Over all I wanted to give 5 stars but the place gets 5 stars for beer, 3 for ambiance because of how loud it gets and a solid 1 on the food.  I know it is a brewery and I should expect much in regards to food but come on, it's not that hard.

Ok, I get that you guys are into slow food but do you have to hire slow servers?  Came here for lunch with a friend and was disappointed.  My server didn't understand that bringing water to your guest is more important than bussing your tables, she bussed two tables before she completed my drink request.  I ordered the Anastasia cocktail and it was great, light and refreshing without being too sweet or over powering.  I wish they offered more of the dinner menu on the lunch menu but I ordered the  1/2 salad and pasta combo.  I got the fettuccini bianco which had great flavor and half of a Cesar salad.  I was disappointed with my "half" salad as the portion size literally looked like a small handful of lettuce.  The pasta came with crispy pancetta and there were 8 tiny pieces in my pasta, I counted because they were my fav part.  Again the service was disappointing, it was obvious my plate had "sat" before it got to me, the sauce on my pasta had a skin on it and my salad was warm.  My server offered fresh pepper for my salad but I really wanted fresh grated parmesan on my pasta, I could see it sitting on the server station in the middle of the room but it wasn't offered.  There was no team work from the other servers, no one offered to clear my plate or refresh my water and my server was too busy clearing tables to notice.  I have previously eaten lunch here and miss the fresh bread and amuse bouche that they used to serve.  I did enjoy the food at this visit but not the service or portion size.  My bill was $21 for lunch and my experience did not match with the amount I paid.

Golden Buddha has GREAT dim sum.  Their prices are reasonable and the staff is very polite wheeling their little carts.  I tend to go on the weekend because there is more selection but they do dim sum throughout the week.  They also have some very authentic dishes on the menu for those who are more of the adventurous types.  Be sure to say hello to the turtles the next time you go.

Stopped by here on a Friday night to catch the tail end of their HH and had a great time!  Their happy hour lasts until 7 PM which is nice for us folks who don't get off work until 6 PM and included some great rolls and appetizers like a crispy spicy tuna and Las Vegas Roll as well as a Sapporo Tall Boy Saki Bomber for $5.  The regular priced specialty rolls were a nice change from the same old same old rolls you see at other sushi joints, I ordered the original tootsie pop which came on sticks and were rolled in thin sliced cucumber.  I would like to see their specialty roll prices be a little more affordable as most of their specialty rolls range from $13-25 but the quality of the food is definitely A+.  Bobby, the manager stopped by our table to introduce himself and check on our evening.  He was very friendly and joked with us for a while which was a nice touch instead of just a generic table flyby of "hey I'm the manager how are we doing."  He even remembered all of our names when he said goodbye to us when we were walking out the door.  My only gripe was our waitress got a little salty when we asked to have separate checks but after explaining they don't offer that service, she would make an exception this time.    My plea to all sushi restaurants, please Please PLEASE put Escolar (Shiro Maguro) on your menu.  For some reason Valley sushi restaurants over look this fish which makes my heart sad :(

We came here on a Thursday night because I had purchased a Groupon.  We were one of 2 tables there which should have been a sign.  We got there around 5:40 and asked about Happy Hour.  We were told happy hour runs until 6 PM and was already over.  After showing our waitress it was indeed 5:40 PM, we finally got menus.  I have always liked Sushi Eye because of their imaginative rolls and beautiful prep that goes into their rolls but things have changed.  We ordered the Orange Blossom roll which in the pictures shows the salmon wrapped around the sushi to look like a flower petal.  Our roll had a small piece of salmon placed on top was not the quantity of fish pictured on the menu.  I ordered miso soup, which was very good, but my White Tuna Sashimi smells fishy and not in a good way.  The Happy hour drink deal was nice though, we had 2 Sake Bombers with big beers and a small carafe of sake for $6 apiece.  We tried to use our Groupon at the end of the meal but our server refused it saying it was "fraudulent".  She explained 3rd party had created it and it had nothing to do with their restaurant, even though their address and menu was attached to it.  She told me to contact Groupon because "Groupon is already aware of the matter and the restaurant had alerted them to the fraudulent deal."  We paid full price and the next day I contacted Groupon about a refund.  Groupon had no idea what I was talking about and said they have never been contacted by Sushi Eye about the matter.  The kicker?  The "Fraudulent" Groupon was still up on their site and available for purchase.  By the time we left at 7:30, we were the last table in the place, not a good sign.

I am slacking.  This is seriously one of the BEST places in PHX and I have yet to review it!  This place cares about its food and about Arcadia.    I come here for the pizza but their menu is amazing for flavor.  My go to pizza is a cheese with extra cheese and a fried egg on top.  Seriously, if you order pizza, any of the pizzas, ask for the fried egg on top.  There is something about the way the yolk mixes with the cheese and the perfectly savory yet sweet tomato sauce.  Some small caveats about LGO, first being table service.  On the weekends they have servers in the dining area and serve only off the dining menu.  Any other time, or if you want to order off the grocery menu, you need to order at the counter on the Grocery side.  The Grocery Side will call your name when your food is ready but all tables on the dining side are reserved for sit down eating on the weekends.  Also, parking is a pain because the main lot is meant for 25 min parking.  Complimentary valet service is available, but I hate being forced to valet when there are perfectly good spaces to park in.   A nice option for us winos, you can buy any bottle of wine on the Grocery side and enjoy it on the Dining side!  No corking fee, no $30+ for a bottle of wine (unless you want to order at $30 bottle of wine), and you can cork and take home whatever you do not finish.  Don't even get me started on the bakery case, just buy it all!

This is my go to spot to say in Old Town!  Unlike other resorts you aren't charged a resort fee and other "staycation" fees are minimal like $14 valet parking/$5 for non guests for the day instead of $30 like other places.  No matter if you stay in a regular room or a suite I have found that the customer service at the VH is amazing!  I have stayed at other Old Town Resorts and locals who were there to party at the pool were treated better than me (paying $1300 a night for a suite) but that is not the way they do things at the VH.  Everyone is treated like they are a big spender yet you don't have to be one to get a room here.  Their spa services are always amazing and the employees are very attentive.  They offer beach cruiser rentals and help navigating Old Town to make sure you have the best experience.  The part I love best is that their summer pool parties are guests only which means you don't end up spending $300 for a room only to find out you are fighting for a chair with some local idiot who paid $10 to get into the pool. Other resorts take note, this is how you do it.

We visited Sushi Ken because it is cold and rainy so of course that left us wanting RAMEN!  We arrived at 6:30 on a Friday and the place was surprisingly busy.  By the time we left, all the tables were full as was the sushi bar, and there was a wait!  The menu itself is a little confusing only because there are menus everywhere.  There is the main menu, a sushi menu, a bento box menu, plus signs all over the restaurant about specials and sushi.  Our waitress was pleasant and helped us navigate what specials we could order based on what food we wanted.  The boy wanted Curry Udon and got their daily special of a noodle dish and a choice of app/sushi/roll ($15).  I ordered the Noodle combo and picked Shio Butter Ramen with butter and Gyudon ($13).  I also ordered the White Tuna Tataki from the $5 special menu.  Both items came with a choice of side salad or edamame.   Overall we were very pleased with the food.  My ramen came with traditional toppings and was very rich and hearty.  The Gyudon was a pleasant surprise, just the right amount of savory and sweet.  We both enjoyed the Gyoza app that The Boy got with his combo, the wrapper was crisp and airy and the meat inside was well seasoned.  The Tuna Tataki was good, but was different than I expected.  It came as a roll stuffed with White Tuna and cucumber and then was topped with more White Tuna.  It was worth it for $5 though.  All and all, we both enjoyed our visit and I enjoyed the bill, the two of us left stuffed for $32.  I still keep thinking about the ramen and kick myself for not taking my leftovers home!

The dine in theater here is a lot of fun and a nice option, especially if you are already planning on dinner before a movie.  The quality of the food is just ok, but if you aren't expecting gourmet fancy pants food, it's pretty good.  Our server was attentive and helpful as well.  The price, it can get to you.  $15 for a ticket with fees, $12 for a drink, $16 for an entrée, soon you are out $50 per person before tip.  I was also disappointed in the cleanliness of the theater, some pages of my menu were stuck together.  No big deal, I'll just exchange it with the seat next to me.  That menu was completely stuck together so I had to use The Boy's menu which was still sticky, but at least not stuck together.   It's fun for a splurge but not an everyday kind of option.  Don't forget to validate your parking!

I recently started working in the S Chandler/Gilbert area and am looking for a great lunch spot.  I decided to try Taiko because their lunch combos look like a great deal and sadly I was disappointed.  Currently the restaurant has happy hour specials all day long and now I am wishing I had gone that route.  I ordered the Chicken Karaange combo with a California Roll which came with Miso Soup, salad, steamed rice and "seasonal fruit" all for $8.50.  Other lunch combos are $10.99-$12.99 which isn't bad but is pricey for lunch.    The Miso soup and salad were great but the rest of my meal was disappointing.  The California roll was 4 small pieces, it was delicious but the portion was sad.  The Chicken Karaange was 5 pieces of chicken each around the size of a golf ball but when I bit into them they were mostly gristly dark meat.  The reason I wrote seasonal fruit with quotations around it is because the fruit I got on my plate was a quarter of an orange or basically a drink garnish.  Overall I can usually get around 2 eats out of a lunch that promises all that food but I left with a stomach full of miso soup, salad and rice. I will definitely be back to try their happy hour specials but will cross this off as a lunch option.  My meal total with tax (no drink) and tip was $10 and was not worth it.

I went to Allure Nails the other day for a Mani/Pedi before I took off on vacation.  The salon is very nice, your typical cookie cutter nail salon but it was clean and the décor was modern and very nice.  They have a flat screen which faces away from the technicians so you don't have your tech paying more attention to Court TV than to your nails.  My tech was very nice, she chatted with me while she did my pedi and was very attentive.  She filed my nails but did not ask if I wanted them trimmed.  Her leg massage was very nice, firm but not half assed like some places do.  She used sea salt and massaged my legs and feet for a good 5 minutes.  The lotion massage was also nice, they use Creative Nail lotion and not that generic "green" lotion from a squeeze bottle.  My only gripe is for my mani. I always get a buff, no polish.  I walked in a 6 PM so by the time for my mani, it was about 6:45.  They close at 7 PM, not sure if she was in a hurry to get me out of there but I still have hang nails on a few of my fingers.  Also when she did my buff, she put cuticle oil on my nails when she was done to make them look shinier.  I like to see myself in the buff of my nails and will tip generously to a tech that will spend the time to make them shine but 12 hours later, my buff is matte and that is being kind.  The mani/pedi combo was $45, a little pricier than similar salons but the décor, cleanliness, premium product and the attentive staff made up for the price increase.  Their polish did look a bit "dry" but I bring my own color so not sure how theirs measure up.  I don't do acrylics so I can't vouch for that service but their pedi was worth it.  I'll be heading to a different salon this afternoon to get another buff since the one I got deserves a 2.  Also they do not accept American Express or Discover so make sure you have cash or a visa on hand!

Tried to make a quick ATM run here today as I have a Chase ATM card but not an account with Chase Bank (sounds funny but just go with me).  It was 11 AM and there was a Loomis Fargo truck blocking the 2 ATM drive ups so they could restock the cash.  I had to go into the lobby and use the ATM inside the branch where I was greeted by a line of 10 people who like me, could only access their funds through an ATM.  I waited over 15 minutes to make a 30 second withdrawal.  Someone from the bank walked out to tell us that they could assist us inside the bank (like I didn't know that was an option) but since I and the rest of the people waiting don't have an actual account with the bank, we had to wait in line for the ATM.     I understand that ATMs need to be serviced but come on.  The sad part is after it took 20 min to get my cash, the Loomis Fargo guys still hadn't finished servicing them.  Total waste of time.

I had forgotten how much I love Hobe Meats and was pleasantly reminded the other day.  Growing up in the Midwest, I am used to a butcher shop that cares about their cuts of meat as well as the quality and Hobe Meats does not disappoint in that regard!  I had a Groupon to use and the gentleman who helped me made sure I used my full value (btw, the Groupon is only good for Prime meats so be sure to ask for direction before you started choosing cuts).  Every member of the staff was friendly and knowledgeable about every cut of meat.  Also before you go check their website for specials.  I got 2 lbs of Ground Beef for $4.99 and petite sirloins for $6.99 (originally over $14 a lb!)  I got a porter house T-Bone, a ribeye, 2 Iowa Chops (you cant get these anywhere else but a butcher shop), 2 lbs ground beef, and 2 lbs petite sirloin all for $82, minus $50 for the Groupon, and out the door at $32!  Just an FYI, all of their prime beef is between $15-19 per lbs with most steaks being 1+ lb.  But once you go prime, you ummmmm want it all the time?  Our Ribeye was aaaaaaaaamazing.  Straight up magic and worth the price tag.

I'll come out and say it, the only reason I go to this place is for the beds.  They have a great selection of UWE beds which are by far some of the nicest beds on the market.  Their level of customer service is non-existent and pricing is a little spendy but you can get more bang for your buck if you figure out which bed works best for you.  You basically have one option, pay $18.88 a month to be a "member."  This gets you unlimited tans in their entry level bed which is your basic 1980's style tanning bed.  If you want to use levels 2-5 beds you have to pay an upgrade fee of $5-20.  Here is where it gets tricky.  If you prepay a set amount ranging from $25-200, you get discounted upgrade fees for each level.  The more you prepay, the cheaper the upgrade fee is.  They have a board that outlines each fee behind the counter so if you have 30 minutes to kill, take a gander at it and try to figure out what you are paying per tan.  Oh and your $18.88 a month is only good at one location, if you want to be able to tan at any Darque location, better up that monthly fee to $22.  I do like the fact that they allow you a pro-rated upgrade fee if you do not go the full max time for each bed.  This is how I save some $$ since I often have a few weeks between sessions and can't go the full time.  The bad news is you have to be a member and have a prepaid balance on your account to get the prorated amount.  The place is always very very clean, they employ a bed cleaner who does a great job!  The AC system keeps it subzero in the building and I have seen them change the bulbs a couple times since I became a member.  They also have a shower in one of their bathrooms incase you are pressed for time but make sure you bring your own towel, they don't provide any.  If you Mystic tan, this place is a bargain.  I believe the lowest prepaid level of $25 starts Mystic at $15-17 a session which is unheard of here in the valley.  The reason I gave this place 2 stars is their staff.  They have young girls behind the counter that have no idea what customer service is.  They will have a line of members out the door while they enter in the information of some college kid who just wants their week of free tanning.  They are quick to try to up sell you lotion, a larger package amount or teeth whiteners but slow to get off their personal call while you wait for them to check you in.  If you ask them a question you will get a blank stare and 9 times out of ten their answer will be the priciest thing they have there.  My personal fav?  Their posted close times are 8 or 11 PM but don't tell you that you can't tan if you get there 30 minutes before close so don't bust your butt to get there because you WILL be turned away.

We used Head Out to Rocky Point for a trip over the 4th of July weekend and I am very impressed!  We chartered a 12 person passenger van with a small trailer to take us to, and from RP over the holiday weekend.  It was $100 per person plus tipfor the trip there and back and was totally worth it.  Our driver, David, was very nice, he helped us load and unload our trailer and kept us informed of stops and any necessary border info we needed to be aware of.  The trailer was a nice touch as well, we were able to store all our luggage and not be cramped in the van as well as had room to bring our own lawn games, chairs, and any other items allowed across the border.  Head Out to RoPo was totally worth it.  On the way back, we were able to skip past at least 90 min of a line of cars and the border guards joked with us as we unloaded our personal baggage because of the great rapport Head Out to RoPo drivers have with them.  The only reason I did not give them 5 stars was the van we rode in needed some attention.  The suspension or shocks were bad and the van often felt like a roller coaster so beware if you get car sick easily.    Will definitely use them again for our next trip!

I grew up in the Midwest where everyone uses a tanning bed so I don't shy away from a good fake glow.  I got a groupon for an unlimited month of tanning for $24 in their entry level beds and couldn't wait to get my bronze on.  The place is very clean and they have an amazing selection of beds (all UWE).  I also didn't have a problem with walking in and was always checked in in a prompt manor.  My issue was with the sales process.  When I came in for my initial visit the girl behind the desk did her best to upsale me to the next level of bed from the one on my groupon.  I was told I could upgrade to the next level for another $30.  I asked about the value of my groupon and they said the $24 value I had paid for it would be put towards another level's month to month price which was really no deal for me to considered upgrading.  Their level 1 bed is a Tropical bed which I am very familiar with and have used before (Bronze Boutique and Darque Tan).  Some beds were great and others there was no direct AC vent to the room and the bed fan was broken.  Some rooms didn't even have a trash can.  Normally I have no problem ramping up to the full time on a bed but I hit a snag with these beds and couldn't get up to the full time.  Anytime I went in the bed over 10 min I got very red afterwards.  Thankfully I never peeled but even tanning, waiting 48 hrs and coming back, I couldn't get past 10 min without being miserable and sore.  When I asked about their bulbs the desk girl was happy to tell me about how much I could spend to upgrade to the next level where I would be "less likely to burn". Oh this business again :/  They do have a large selection of lotions but they are not quality.  I am a Cal Tan girl and will occasionally stray to Matahari but I DON'T want to buy some cheap lotion created by JWOWW or Kardashian. Bottom line, you will be nickel and dimed (and burned) unless you want to shell out $80 a month for their Diamond level beds.

Another Lunch Review, at least I tried to Lunch here.  I was in the mood for sushi and Kobe is right across the street from my office so I figured I could walk and get to go in my 30 min lunch break   Sushi for lunch and I don't have to get in my hot car?  Score!  Here's where things fail.  They don't open for lunch until 11:30, I arrived at 11.  Who doesn't open for lunch until 11:30?!  Especially with multiple business complexes in the area (think Insight, Honeywell, U of Phoenix, Express Scripts) and hungry workers.  Walked back to my car and went to Sakana down the street which is what I should have done in the first place.

By a fluke, I ended up at DVAP looking for a master cylinder and brake booster for a 1962 Oldsmobile Starfire.  My father in Iowa owns the car and had the ordinal part split while being worked on and was able to track down a similar year model at DVAP.  In comes his favorite child to the rescue!  DVAP is like a candy store, they have acres of American-made cars ranging from the 1960's to the 1980's and have another location in Casa Grande.  They have an EXTENSIVE inventory and are very thorough with their inventory knowing what car is where on the lot.  Several people called in looking for specific parts while I was waiting for them to pull my part and they were able to confirm over the phone if that had that car, or that part.  They also allow visitors into the yard to look for parts at a $2 charge (Bring cash, they have a minimum $15 CC/Debit charge) but they don't allow tools on the lot.  If you find what you are looking for, they will give you a price quote, then radio a tech to pull the part for you.  The guys in the office were very knowledgeable and helpful.  My father had talked to Tye over the phone to secure the part and he made sure I did not leave until I had the right one.  He even had an image he was able to share with the tech when he accidentally brought back the wrong one.  These guys know their stuff!  Kudos to them and a BIG thank you for helping us keep our baby running, or at least in this case, able to stop.

My friends and I started coming to Hazelwoods for their Thursday night trivia and always have a blast!  Not only do they have a great happy hour but they also have nightly drink specials depending on the day of the week.  Besides Team Trivia, they also organize card games on specific nights (sorry I'm not sure what kind though).  I also love their beer selection, 16 beers on tap!  For being a dive bar, they also have pretty good food.  My friends and I always end up ordering the Pretzel with spicy cheese dip!  It is a very large portion and comes hot and buttery from the oven.  I also love their 1st place burger which is HUGE at a  1/2 pound!  You can even add another burger patty on to make it a full lb but the regular burger is more than enough for me.  The main down falls is that they nickel and dime you on some items.  Adding cheese to the sliders or the burger is going to set you back $1, sometimes the server will tell you and most times they won't.  Also I have asked for ranch dressing in place of some sauces the appetizer comes with and I still charged $0.50 for "extra dressing," even though I don't get the sauce AND the dressing.  Service can be hit and miss as well.  I've had a server one time that was very short with our table but then another night, the same server joked and had a good time with us.    All in all, if you are looking for a chill place to hang out with your friends and watch the game that has cheap beer and decent food, Hazelwoods is your place!

After wanting to try this restaurant for a while now, I was finally able to convince my friends that the Estate House was not pricey or lame as they had heard.  We tried to eat in the upstairs bar area (live music is always a plus) but were told they only serve appetizers on the 3rd floor, dinner is served in the main dining room.  We headed downstairs and were sat immediately by friendly staff and the hostess.  Our waiter started the evening out a bit odd.  We got our food menus and our waiter came by to introduce himself and drop off the drink menu.  He then told us that we needed to "liven up" because our group seemed quiet.  Umm ok?  We all decide on drinks and then wait for our waiter to return.  He finally appears 15 minutes later apologizing because he was with another "large party" that took up his time.  We order drinks all of which are pretty simple (vodka soda splash cranberry, vodka rocks dirty) and he has trouble understanding us.  My friend had to order her Grey Goose L'Orange and soda 3 times before he understood what she wanted.  During the summer, they are offering a 3 course price fixed menu ($20, $30 and $40) until August 31st which is a GREAT deal.  The only problem is there seemed to be more options on the price fix menu than on the regular menu.  We asked the server if we could order just the entrée off the PF menu and were told no but "it is an amazing deal so you should just order the PF option."  My friend had to tell him it wasn't a deal if you weren't going to be able to eat all 3 courses.  The waiter asked if we had any questions about the menu and my friend asked what chicken saltimbocca is.  Our waiter stumbled through a few words and umms before he said he would go ask the kitchen.  He never came back to explain the dish.  Our drinks arrive, sans the L'Orange and soda.  The waiter had to have my friend point out what she wanted on the drink menu and then exclaimed "Oh L'Orange!" as if she had been ordering something else the entire time.  The other drinks were incorrect, vodka cranberry instead of vodka soda splash cran and the remakes were wrong, vodka water splash cran.  My dirty was the only one that came out correct but I think that is because it had the least ingredients.  We order dinner and wait around 25 minutes for the first course of salads to come out.  We did get a nice complimentary amuse bouche which was a wonderful surprise.  The first course had to be sent back after the appetizer came loaded with cream.  Our dinner guest specifically said she has a dairy allergy and to omit the cream but the dish came out covered in the stuff.  After another 25 minute wait for the entrees, we finally got the rest of the meal.  I had ordered the fillet which was cooked perfectly and was a nice quality.  The dish also included a potato cake which was also good but not great.  I had 2 sauces on my plate, both of which were bland.  I asked a waiter for some salt and he brought out sea salt and explained "we do not carry iodized salt in our restaurant so this is natural sea salt."  Umm ok, I guess I can go one meal with out iodized salt and not get a goiter.  After we were all stuff, our waiter reminded our friend that he had a dessert coming for his 3rd course.  He suggested the bread pudding which was great and we all shared a few bites, except for our dairy allergy friend since the dessert came with ice cream on the top.  Overall, I give the place a 2.  The food was just ok so it gets a 3, the ambiance gets a 3 and the service gets a 1.  I understand everyone has their off nights but when your bill for 5 people is $300, you would hope you would get a little better attention.

I live down the street from Scratch Pastries and LOVE their food.  I haven't sampled everything on their menu but recommend the Quiches, which size wise are big enough to share.  Their mushroom soup is awesome too, just make sure you aren't in a hurry if you order it because it does take some time as they make it as ordered.  Their house dressing is very tasty too.  Usually I avoid a vinaigrette like the plague but this one has a nice flavor without coming across too strong.  The color and consistency is a little weird but once you get past that, you are in salad heaven.    Their pastries are amazing and so is their tea selection.  Their Eros tea blend is amazing for you tea lovers out there.  Their desserts? O...M...G!!!  I've died and gone to heaven.  I would have given 5 stars but there are a couple of gripes.  Their hours are kind of random and have changed from the ones they have posted on their window, not sure if the ones on the website are correct?  My other gripe is the only side they have for all of their entrees is a mixed green salad.  I have health issues that make it difficult to eat lettuce/Mixed greens so unless I want to be miserable, I can't eat the side salad.  I even asked my server, explained my dilemma and he said they didn't have anything to substitute.  Oh well, you win some you lose some.

This is one of those places where you question "are we really supposed to be here?!" But once enter Pizza A, you know you made the right decision.  It is a small venue, maybe seats 40 people tops but is a great place to sit and grab a slice.  My go tos are the meatball pizza and also the pizza with prosciutto and arugula.  The website isn't working night now otherwise I would find the name.  I love that you can get a regular pie or even get "The Metro," a meter of pizza.  Someday I will do something so that I an order a true Metro pizza but until that day. I will just order the regular pie.  If you have a large 6+ part call ahead to make sure they have space because the place is pretty small but they def don't skimp on flavor!

We came to Texas Roadhouse for Mother's Day dinner and will not be back.  We called ahead and got a pager # for our party of 5 and were told 30 min wait.  There were 4 of us waiting and a 5th on their way so we were going to need an odd sized regardless.  Our 5th ended up getting stuck in traffic when our # was called.  Here is what transpired at the hostess stand:  Hostess: Great, is all your party here? Me: Yes the 4 of us are here and our 5th is stuck in traffic Hostess: Well I need all of your party here to seat you. Me: I understand, there are 4 of our 5 and the other almost here. Hostess: We can't seat you until your entire party is here. Me: I understand, she is moments away and it is one person in a part of five, not like we are holding a table and waiting for several people. Hostess: We don't seat incomplete parties. Me: I understand that. Hostess: We have a sign. (points to sign that says 'we don't seat incomplete parties') Me:  Yes I see the sign Hostess: we have two signs. (points to another sign that says 'we don't seat incomplete parties') Me: ....... Hostess: (gestures to both signs again) Me: so are being penalized because our friend is stuck in traffic? Hostess: I already told you, we don't seat incomplete parties.  So now we are back to waiting and our friend ended up not coming so we wouldn't have to wait another 20 min to be seat.  Thanks for helping us make wonderful family memories, Texas Road House!  Happy Mother's Day!

There is the saying that "you get what you pay for" and that saying does not apply to the W Scottsdale.  The staff is always helpful and inviting to a point.  When I have stayed there I have had wonderful help with demagnetized keys, special requests and help moving rooms.  At one point the ice machine on our floor was broken and they sent a bellman up to our room with a bucket of ice upon request.  This was great service until the 3rd time we called and they questioned why we kept asking for ice delivery when we had a unit on our floor.  Ummmm maybe because it was broken but the front desk made us feel like we were lazy people for not getting ice ourselves.  My biggest gripe is the way they treat their guests.  I have been a regular room guest and a $2k a night suite guest and was treated the same way as a person off the street in their bar.  First of all, if you over night park with the hotel you WILL be charged $30 per car.  I get that this is normal albeit gouging price  for a resort but if I have rented out a $$$ suite, I expect a few concessions.  Another problem was that when I called down to the front desk to reserve a chair by the pool I was told that "they don't keep track of that and I just need to go down to the pool to see what is available."   I went down to the pool and watched the bouncer allow 4 locals to pay $10 to get into the pool while I waited to be noticed.  Once into the pool area I asked about a deck chair and was told they were 1st come 1st serve (great the $10 Douchebags were allowed a chair at the same rate I was as a paying guest) but they were happy to sell me a day bed for $200 or bottle service for $500.  At the time I was staying in the Mega Suite and couldn't even get a chair by the pool.  After raising a fuss (which I hate to do but our suite was $1300 a night and I can't even get a GD deck chair by the pool) and they suggested a small fold out chair on the grass.  Come. Freaking. On.  Don't even get me started on the fact that the elevator won't move unless you swipe your key.  I know I know its to keep non-guests from wandering the halls but if you forget your key on a quick trip to your car you are screwed.  Bottom line, spend $$$$ to be treated like you spent $$.

Sent out to buy lunch for the entire office from Louisiana Chicken only to find out they closed.  Well not exactly closed, the sign on the door that greeted us said they failed to pay their lease.  I saw someone uploaded a picture of their Burglary sign in August but this was definitely not the same sign.  Not sure how the person above me checked in on 9/23 but this location is closed.

o...m...g  amazing!!!  I tend to stick to their beef items but everything I have had is amazing.  It's a garlic lovers paradise with their garlic rice and Tzatziki sauce and their portions are HUGE.  My only gripe is their fries since I am not a thick steak fry person but I just get their plate meal that comes with entrée, small greek salad, garlic rice and a pita with a side of Tzatziki sauce.  The dining area is small and the place can fill up quickly during lunch but totally worth the wait!

So for my b-day cake I have a theory, if you have to get older, you better celebrate with the best cake you can find and this year I decided to try Butter and Me.  Prob the best idea of my new age.  I requested a cake version of a cupcake variety I had had a few years previous at the Scottsdale Culinary Festival, chocolate cake with brown sugar butter cream and bacon toffee bits on top.  I wasn't sure what shape/size of cake I wanted but Kelly was very helpful and accommodating.  The cake was spectacular and she had added a little glitter so it was pretty and girly but not garish.  And the Brown Sugar Buttercream?  O......M....G!  I could eat it every day of my life it was so good and hands down one of the best frostings I have ever tasted.    I got tons of compliments on the cake, everyone loved it and I have NO idea how I am going to top this cake next year.  People say they wish she would open a store front but I would be 500 lbs if she did!

I have been coming to Hanny's for years and it never disappoints.  Normally we come for drinks and a bar plate while we wait for even traffic to die down but this time we came for a sit down meal and it was AMAZING!    The boy ordered the steak and I had the Pork Milanese and they were both amazing.  The Pork Milanese was a very large portion for the price and there was no way I was able to finish it, even though I tried.  The lemon butter sauce was on the side so the pork cutlet stayed crispy and the sauce gave a great flavor to the dish, subtle but not over powering.  The boy's steak was tender and had a really nice flavor to it.  It came with gorgonzola (which he hates and opted out of) and even without the sauce, it tasted delicious.  Hanny's is a hidden gem in the down town area.  From the DJ, to the décor, to the elevator shaft, to the unisex restroom, this place is an original.  Plus it is always worth it to take a newbie to check out the basement ;)

Is anyone else tired of being forced to Valet your car in Scottsdale?  Ok I can already hear my fellow Yelpers rolling their eyes since I live and go out in Scottsdale but seriously when did it become ok to make a living over public parking?  I had a birthday party at the Lodge this weekend and rolled in at 7:30 for dinner.  The valet guy had already roped off the entire Lodge parking lot but hadn't "opened for business" yet.  I pulled into the lot and watched him run over to me, I was perfectly prepared to pay him the $6 for a job he didn't even do but was told I wasn't allowed to park there.  I said I was happy to pay the valet fee but he said he wouldn't open for another 45 minutes so he couldn't take my $$ but also couldn't let me park there?     I love the Lodge, I give them props for being a diamond in the rough of Scottsdale d-bag bars but just because you in the 'Dale doesn't mean you need to stick it to your customers!  That being said, we had a kick a$$ time at the Lodge!  They serve good drunk food (even late at night), have a great selection of beer as well as bar games to play.  Of course you have your typical Buck Hunter and Golden Tee but they also have a Wii with Mario Cart up at the bar, just ask if you can play and you'll be there for hours.  They have bags on the outdoor patio and a "giant" drunk Jenga game.  I'll warn you, the Jenga is popular so you WILL have other patrons trying to take it from you.  There was a skewed guy to girl ration when I was there but in a bar with stuffed animals (not the Carebear kind) lining the walls, what do you expect?  The Lodge is a refreshing change from the typical Scottsdale bar and I'd reco it to anyone in Scottsdale or anyone who has a negative opinion of Scottsdale.  Just try to carpool to save money, you won't find a parking space that doesn't cost you $$$ to park there.

I was so excited when DD opened up since I love me some liquor with my breakfast (sorry Breakfast Club).  It became our new go to breakfast spot and never disappointed.  I am a huge fan of their benedicts especially their crab cake bene.  My friends are healthy eaters and always raved about their Egg White wrap or the Turkey and Sausage White out.  Servers were always helpful and courteous, even when my hung over friend had random requests like 2 medium poached eggs and wheat toast no butter.  Mimosas are great here too so make sure you aren't hung over to get one.    The owners often stop by tables to see how things are going and are very friendly.  One time one of our friends was a little green from the night before and the owner brought her over an herb remedy to help settle her stomach.  The place can get busy but service is always great as is the food.  I haven't made it there for dinner yet but it is def on the agenda.  Great work DD!!

The Ahwatukee Farmers Market, while smaller than other markets, is a great addition to the 'Tuk!  Selection depends on the day so I suggested coming multiple times.  Vendors pick and choose which days they want to set up shop so the line up is consistently changing.  This market is a mix of goods and food, both produce and ready to eat/take home items.  While I respect that people are passionate about their items, some booths can get a little pushy when it comes to sales.  I'm looking at you, Candle Guy.  I also like that this market listens to its shoppers as well as hustles to promote the vendors. Their FB page is also a good source for information on what vendors they have and the types of items they are selling.  EBT and Debit/Credit cards are accepted as well.

We tried to go there the other day.  I said tried because we did go there around 10:30 for a late breakfast early lunch.  My friend and I walked inside to be great by what is pretty much the same set up as Dish had.  The place seems to have everything you can think of food wise but lacks in the employee department.    We walked around trying to find some menus to order from since sandwiches or Pizza seemed a bit heavy.  Every employee stared us down like we aren't supposed to be there as we walked by but never offered assistance.  After around 10 minutes of aimlessly walking around, I went over to the Catering area and asked the lady if we could get breakfast.  She informed met that they do not have servers but if we wanted to order a la cart breakfast items we could do so at the espresso bar.  We head over to the espresso island but see nothing breakfast related on their LCD menu screen.  The guy in the island ignores as he did the previous time we stood in front of his area until I finally had to ask for a breakfast menu since it wasn't listed on the LCD screen.  He tells me they only have a la cart burrito type items but they stop serving breakfast at 10:30 and it is now 11 AM.  Umm ok?  At this point we just gave up and left.  So we pretty much aimlessly walked around for 15 minutes to NOT be helped by the employees working until we had to search out workers out to help us.  I'm sure the food is wonderful, it looked wonderful but I don't know if I want to take the time to drive and then wait for someone to help me to try it out.  At least the people at Dish acted like they wanted your business.

Went back for a pedi last night and it was great!  Got the sea salt and an added 15 minute leg massage for $35.  It was definitely worth the extra $$$.

omg, Omg, OMG!   I'll admit, I am a bit of a gypsy when it comes to nail salons.  I roam about the valley and when the mood strikes me, I will want a mani pedi (hence all the nail salon yelp reviews) so I go where ever is close at the time.  My salon wandering has come to an end now that I have found Biagio!  First off the place is immaculate, wonderful interior, clean and none of that chemical nail place smell.  This time I only got a pedi but was immediately was sat in a clean and new chair.  All the nail techs wear white smocks which is a nice professional touch so I don't have to stare at their bedazzled Baby Phat shirt.    I didn't get my nail tech's name (I have to keep some of my gypsy ways) but she was ah-maze-ing!  The tools she used came in a sanitize sealed bag but she still placed them in a shot glass of disinfectant in front of me, instead of pulling tools out of a pencil case that god knows when they were cleaned.  My tech was friendly and polite as were the other techs there.  All mani's and pedi's include a reflexology hand/arms or foot/lower leg massage and a hot towel.  I upgraded for $6 for the sea salt scrub which alone was worth it.  Between the foot massage, sea salt massage and lotion massage my tech spent 20 minutes on my legs which alone will get me back in the door.  Just when I thought I was all massaged out (is there such a thing?) my tech gave me a neck and back massage.  Once all the massaging was over, my tech checked my cuticles again and cleaned up/touched up any areas she wasn't satisfied with.  The polish I picked was a bit sheer so she also did a triple coat without me having to ask or up charging me which was a plus.  From start to finish my pedi was pretty darn close to an hour and my bill with the upgrade was $29.  Biagio offers a lot of services including Shellac Gel at reasonable prices, waxing, facials and retail items.  Their color selection was a little limited but they sell retail polish so I am sure a lot of clients bring their own or purchase the latest shade.  They don't offer a discounted mani/pedi combo so combined it will set you back $38 but if they pay as much attention to your hands as they did to my feet it is def worth it!

Stopped by Petite for brunch on Sunday and it was delish!  I had their take on Eggs Benedict which was light and fresh and the eggs were perfectly poached.  My brunch companion had the chicken and mushroom stuffed crepes but we both got plate envy when we saw our neighbor table had ordered the Petite Maison burger!!  It was HUGE, a two hander and looked very juicy!    Drinks were just as good as the meal, they serve French press coffee and fresh squeezed OJ.  My friends and I like to think we are sangria connoisseurs and their French take on red Sangria was one of the best I have ever had!  It was a little pricey at $9 but worth every penny.  The menu is a bit intimidating if you don't know French but our server was more than helpful with questions and pronunciations.  The food did take a little bit of time so make sure you aren't in any real hurry.  But you won't want to be in a hurry if you are on their patio, it is darling!!  It's like a little French Oasis just yards from Scottsdale Rd.  You may want to bring a bird book because the shrubs and flowers attracted 3 types of humming birds during our brief lunch.  I can't wait to go back for Dinner to see their PM menu or their late night "Staff Menu" but I will make sure to call ahead for a reservation.  They weren't kidding when they called this place "Petite," the inside has 8 tables and the patio around the same.

I love the fresh pressed tortillas at Panchero's!  No more dry, flour-y tortillas for this gal and I love the variety of menu items they have.  I hate to use the C-Word (cough, cough, Chipotle) but that place doesn't compare to the delicious flavors and fresh, chewy tortillas at Panchero's.  Another amazing menu item at Panchero's is their queso dip, I highly recommend adding it to your burrito, it is worth the up charge.  Unlike that C-Word place, this fresh mex place has quesadillas on the menu which is my other go to purchase.

All of my online shopping accounts had a notation to never, ever, ever, ship anything to me through OnTrac.  I have had packages stolen from in front of my door on 3 separate occasions.  I live in an apartment and my front door is in a heavy traffic area.  There are 4 other apartments that face mine and all of the 3rd floor has to pass by my door to get to their apartments.  I called OnTrac to report the theft and they said it is the "driver's discretion" if they leave it at the door, even though my door is in a high traffic area and my office accepts packages.    Another time OnTrac delivered my package early, yay!  Except I didn't answer my door because they delivered on a SUNDAY and the delivery driver banged on my door yelling "HELLO!  HELLO? HELLO!".  UPS has delivered to my home after 8 PM and has always identified themselves as UPS, but not OnTrac.  I don't open my door unless I am expecting company and certainly not when it sounds like the person wants to murder me.    Since I have had 3 packages stolen from their deliveries, you think they would make a note on my address to NOT leave it at the door.  I have even left notes saying please deliver to the front office and the driver was too lazy to walk the 20 yrs to the office.  Avoid them at all costs!

I LOVE me some 5th and Wine.  Not only for the wine selection but for their great food.    First off the wine section.  I am a big wino and have never been disappointed with the wine selection.  They really have something for taste and every budget.  They also do month wine dinners which is a 4 course dinner with wine parings which is amazing.  Second, they have a really diverse menu and great portions.  I am a meatarian so it will sound funny to say that I recommend the Chopped Salad but GET THE CHOPPED SALAD!  I also love the burger with Cambozola cheese and regular fries.   People refer to the fries as "crack fries" and they are not lying, probably my favorite fries in The Valley.  I am also a big fan of their Bourbon Glazed Salmon, it has a lot of flavor and isn't too sweet.  My only gripe is it can get a bit loud inside especially when they have music so if you are looking for a quiet dinner be prepared for some noise.

This place struggles.  We have come and have good food but terrible service.  Other times we have terrible service but good food.  The last stop falls under the former, we stopped by to check out their happy hour specials which were great for beer and wine, but our server didn't mention any food specials like the HH Menu photos state.  The boy ordered the Brisket Burrito special which he liked, but was mostly full of filler and not a lot of brisket.  I ordered the Blue Sky Cheeseburger with fries and was disappointed.  The beef had no seasoning what so ever and tasted flat.  The french-fries were cold and soggy and the side of ranch dressing was runny and flavorless.  The Boy watched our food sit in the warmer window for about 5 min before it was served.  There are some menu items that are truly worth the trip but with the Russian roulette of bad service good food and good service bad food it makes it hard to want to come back.

Been tanning here since they opened and love the place.  Even though they only have 6 tanning beds and the spray, I always get in and out quickly and never have to wait like other places that have 20+ beds.  I've tried all of their beds and each level does a great job of getting you nice and brown and are always clean.  Other places make you pay monthly and then prepay to pay to upgrade your bed but not here.  Their pricing structure is reasonable and straight-forward too, I have a monthly membership and then pay to upgrade every now and then to boost my bronzing.    I have also have had mani/pedi's done here and would recommend that too.  Their nail area is modern, clean and relaxing without having those annoying massage chairs.  Their techs are also friendly and knowledgeable and do great work.  I don't do fake nails but am friends with them on Facebook and they regularly post beautiful fills and acrylics so I would recommend them for those also.  All in All a great place to get beautiful!

Finally a bar who knows how to treat their customers!  I love the fact that their happy hour runs 5-9 PM every day instead of a measly 2 hour one like the stingy places.    The food is pretty meh but I don't mind it when it is at happy hour prices!  Drinks are also imaginative and flavorful and they have a great selection at the bar.  I just wish they had more than 2 beers on tap especially with all the great local beers we have now.  Bartenders are also friendly and knowledgeable which is nice if you want to sit and the bar and interact.  The place does get pretty dark around 10 so if you are there to visit with a good friend you might want to find a place where you can see each other.  Overall a nice place to chill!

I go out of my way to get my gas here.  Why? The staff is always courteous, the store is clean and their gas prices are consistently $0.08-$0.15 cents cheaper than other stations just down the block.  Combine that with the fact they accept Fry's Fuel Points and it really lessens the blow of dropping $$$ to fill up your tank.

During our search for a new mattress, we decided to shop local and give R&S a try.  The associate who helped us, Doug, was amazing.  He was helpful, listened to our concerns, and made some great recommendations for the types of mattresses we should look for to meet our needs.

Watched the "sandwich artist" go through a tray of bread and throw 4 loaves away due to them being under cooked before selecting a loaf out of the same batch to make my sandwich.  Needless to say it was doughy and inedible. I ended up throwing the rest of my foot long away. Their prices are also $0.50-$1.00 more than the regular $5 foot long prices of other stores. Quality control does not seem to matter here.

We stopped by BW3 (Ohio baby!) during our most recent trip to the mall for lunch and I was very impressed.  We were allowed to pick our own table, greeted, and asked if there was a particular game we came to watch and offered to change channels if there was something we did want to watch that wasn't already on. Nice touch.  We were also offered a sample of their new triple cheesy appetizer thing (cheese curds, motz sticks, and grilled cheese sandwich dusted with their "Desert Heat" spice) which was another nice touch.  The grilled cheese with the Desert Heat spice was very surprising.   I don't do bones or cartilage so I opted for the Boneless Wings snack size and they were not snack sized.  The snack size was 8 boneless wings in all their saucy glory and was a lot to eat.  The Boy, on the other hand, eats everything on the wing/drummy except the bone so he went with 15 wings (can't remember the size) with 3 different sauces.  Wings come with your choice of blue cheese or Ranch and carrots or celery.   The Boy really enjoyed the Lemon Pepper wings and the Medium, the Spicy garlic made him sweat. My Teriyaki boneless were very good, well sauced with it getting in every nook and cranny of the breading.  Service was well done as well and we really enjoyed our visit to BW3. Game on!

Valley Eyecare Center is the Best!  I have been going here for around 4 years now and see Dr Eric Clyde.  The staff is pleasant and the offices are always clean.  They have a great selection of eye wear and have up to date technology that takes the place of more antiquated techniques like eye dilatation.  They are also considerate of patients time and strive to stay on time.    They accept most major insurances and are very upfront about anything that may not be covered by your insurance.  I use their online booking to request my visits, no muss no fuss.    Keep up the great work, Valley Eyecare Center!

Another amazing trip to Valley Eye Care! I had Flex Spending to use and it has been years since I have gotten new frames so I decided to splurge.    The staff was careful to listen to my budget and help me navigate through different choices. Valley Eyecare Center carries a variety of brands and styles to fit any budget.  Some the brands they carry include Coach, Juicy Couture, Calvin Klein, Nike, Ray Bans, Original Penguin, Oliver Peoples, Dior, Max Mara, and Kate Spade just to name a few.  Since I was paying cash, the frames specialist worked with me and my budget and made things affordable for me. I was looking to get frames, Rx Lenses, and a pair of sunglasses and she made it happen. She even double checked my insurance to see if we could switch things around (I previously used my coverage for contacts) to make sure I was getting the best deal.    And I forgot to mention they do 50% off a 2nd set of frames both vision and sunglasses!  I got 50% off a pair of Dior sunglasses, how awesome is that?

Soooo I was craving a good burger and had heard good things about The Grind so I decided to check it out.  What I got was a very good burger but very poor service and a pricey bill.  I got there just in time for happy hour and ordered a Kiltlifter on the HH menu.  The bartender was nice and offered to ring in two for me so I could get the deal since "they are only $2" but I had to function later so I declined.  I told the bartender I was going to order food as well and he slides me a menu.  Aaaand then proceeded to forget about me for 20 minutes.  Granted I had my beer but my main purpose for going there was because I was starving.  A gentleman sat next to me and experienced the same thing, it took him 15 minutes to get a beer and the bar was not busy at all.  The main bartender was too busy chatting with his one regular about the NFL draft or air humping to pay attention to his guests.  Yes I said air humping.  I think you get what I am saying.  He even forgot to finish making a drink for his regular half way through because he stopped to get a drink of root beer.  Someone forgot to take their ADD meds today.  Finally one of the other employees came over and took the order of 4 other bar patrons and alerted the 2 bartenders that she had to do their work.  The main bartender pitched a bitch fit to his other bartender about how it wasn't his fault and gossip gossip gossip but dude, it was your fault.  After waiting to be recognized again, I finally ordered my burger and it was amazing.  Hands down one of the best burgers in town.  My gripe?  It ended up being a $12 with no side.  No fries, no salad, not even a pickle.  I also only got 2 cheese choices, cheddar and swiss.  Come on what is this McDonalds?  So I drank my beer, wolfed down my burger and tried to ignore the antics of one annoying bartender.  Grand total for beer and burger was $15.75 (beer was actually $3.50 not $2).  Was the burger amazing?  Yes!  Did feel like I got my moneys worth?  No.  Did I want to punch that annoying bartender in the face? YES!  I would expect this kind of service in Scottsdale but this is Arcadia folks, step it up.

RnR I tried to like you, I really did.  I've lived in Scottsdale for a few years now so I am used to the restaurant/night club/trendy spot but I just couldn't get into RnR.  I've been there for dinner several times and didn't enjoy myself.  The place is loud, the food mediocre and the service ranges from good to plain awful.  Nothing on the menu ever really grabbed my attention so I had the Rock shrimp appetizer and a side of Parmesan fries.  My two dinner-mates each ordered a sandwich with fries as well.  My rock shrimp were ok, nothing to write home about and my side of $6 fries was tiny.  My friend's side of fries on their sandwiches was a larger portion than the side I paid extra for.    Before I wrote the place off, I wanted to stop by for breakfast since I had heard about their endless mimosa and blood mary special.  The special is a little confusing, if you aren't ordering a breakfast entrée it $25 but if you do order an entrée it is $15.  Our server was busy that morning but also was very spaced out.  Forgot to bring our joiner a water or silverware and was very non-existent.  The place was a little busy so I wanted to cut him some slack but he never wrote down our orders and then would come back to clarify on what we had ordered because he forgot.  The endless special seemed like a good deal until I realized they didn't make each refill on your mimosa but came around with a pitcher of pre mixed mimosas so some tasted like just OJ and some like a weak mimosa.  My friend who had the endless bloody enjoyed his deal, each bloody was a little different made each time (once with a slice of bacon, once with bacon bits, once with no bacon at all) but all in all thought it was a good for the price.  My $3 cup of coffee was not refilled, even when I requested.  The food on the menu was a different story.  I ordered the 3 breakfast tacos and requested a side of hash browns instead of home fries.  Our waiter didn't write down my order so of course it arrived with home fries but the food runner was happy to bring me the side of hash browns.  My friends enjoyed their build your own burritos but my food was subpar.  My tacos were greasy and lacked flavor.  Every time I picked up my taco for a bite, grease ran out the bottom.  Even my potato and egg taco was greasy and flavorless.  The hash browns were soggy and covered in cooking grease as well.  I'm all for a greasy spoon hang over breakfast but this was over board.  The server was happy to oblige our request for separate checks but again because he failed to write down our order, all our checks were wrong but by this time we were ready to leave so we paid what he gave us and left.    The people watching WAS amazing.  It was noon on a Sunday and there were girls in full make up and going out clothes (not walk of shame either) and d-bags galore.  If I wanted to start a drinking game at RnR it would be drink when ever some dude in a plaid shirt high fives another dude.

I have died and gone to pizza heaven.  No literally this place is pizza heaven!  My go to pizza is the Tirolese which is so good I really don't order anything else.    I am bummed that they are moving down town instead of staying in the Scottsdale area.  It is terrible the Borgata is being torn down to build condos but they were definitely a hidden gem in Scottsdale.

This place should be called Magic OMFG Noodle because it was soooooooo gooooooood!    I had the regular noodles with the Beef/Oyster sauce and it did not disappoint.  My friend got a larger size of noodle and said that it was a little too much noodle and she would go with regular next time but the food was still very good.  I ordered the egg rolls which were very "meh" but the noodles more than made up for it.    Wish they carried beer or wine but by the time I finished my plate, there wasn't room in my stomach for anything else.

A double Vienna beef dog with all the fixings and fresh hand cut fries for $4.35, how can you go wrong?  You can't beat their prices or the food quality and they have a great menu that makes me think I am in Chicago.  I do get my order to go since the fryer smell will linger with you throughout the day but always worth the trip!

I mean, who actually ENJOYS going to get waxed?  It hurts and is annoying and you have a relative stranger poking around at your business for 20-30 minutes.  I went to Rio for the first time and would absolutely recommend it hands down over any other wax place in the valley!  I didn't have the famed Danielli but my waxologist Sara was amazing!  She had me laughing the entire time which is hard when the anticipation has your reflexes on high alert.  Sara was also great to talk about what I was looking for so I didn't walk away with too much taken off or too little.  Since I was a first time client I got a nice deal but even without the special pricing the prices are great for the quality of service.  They even offer a membership that offers a discount for frequent waxers, bulk session pricing and a frequent customer punch card.  I really look forward to my next visit which is prob the first time I have ever said that about waxing.  Keep up the great work ladies, if i could give you 5+ stars i would!

I lived at Monterra for 2.5 years and when it was good, it was good, but when it was bad it was horrid.  The Good: My apartment was actually affordable when I moved in.  I was paying $575 for a one bedroom (essentially a studio since it was 475 sq ft) with a washer/dryer, microwave, dishwasher, and disposal.  The fridge in my unit was not a full size one but I made it work.  The neighborhood is not the "nicest", just don't venture out after dark. Electric through APS were reasonable, usually $40 in the winter to $120 in the summer with a direct west facing unit.   The Horrid: I chose not to renew my lease for a variety of reasons but partly was due to increase in rent.  To re-sign my lease for another year it was raised to $666 (you couldn't raise or lower it a $1?) which does not include water, sewer, trash, admin fees, city taxes, and renters insurance.  This was going to push my living costs above $725.  The above utilities are all measured per unit/per usage but those combined were around $30-40 per month for my small unit.  I did use their renters insurance which was $20 per month and included with my rental payment directly to Monterra.    My neighbors were also a big pain and there was a constant revolving door of bad neighbors. The Cops were called to my building multiple times.  My neighbors were quick to steal any package left at my doorstep with over 8 packages taken in 2.5 yrs.  I had my car damaged by the tenant who parked next to me and when I contacted the office, I was told that was my business to handle it with the other resident.   The grounds were nice but full of dog poop.  At least once a month the complex would threaten to fine dog owners but more poop would be waiting in the grass the next day.  My neighbors were too lazy to walk to sidewalk to smoke their cigarettes and would light up in the enclosed hallways.    The office cemented up their night drop box and only accept online payments.  This doesn't sound like that big of a deal but I had an error with my bank and was unable to use the free bank pay service. Instead I had to pay online with a credit card, or drop off certified funds.  The Online bill pay gouges you anywhere from 3% (if you are lucky) to 8% processing fee which really adds up over the months.  I chose to pay in money orders to save money but without a night drop, the office hours are very inconvenient to drop anything off on time if you have a 9-5 job and if you do make a special trip, the office will be closed for lunch.   Upon moving in, I was very disappointed with the condition of the apartment.  The carpets were cleaned but definitely not new, and pink stains (not mine) began surfacing the first few days I was there.  I found a chicken bone in my "clean" dishwasher when I went to load it as well as several stranger's ATM receipts in the dryer with my first load of clean clothes.  I was unable to take a shower the first night I was there due to the tub/shower being so stopped up with someone else's hair it wouldn't drain.    I lived here for 2.5 yrs but was still expected to "return the apartment to the original move in condition otherwise you will be charged to bring the unit back to move in conditions" and boy, they were not kidding.  If you live anywhere for any extended time, there is usually wear and tear that you can't help.  There is usually a concession given if you live in an apartment for several years on wear and tear, but not at Monterra.    When I moved out, I was charged $65 to clean 400 sq ft of carpet (I later found out I could have them cleaned on my own which could have had done for less). The carpet cleaning charge being your responsibility was never disclosed to me and is charged upon move out. Usually damage to the carpet and unit is pro-rated (based on how old the carpet is when you moved in as well as how long you occupy the unit) but not here. I was also charged $100 to repaint the apartment (the charge was later reversed once I pointed out during walk through I was told I was NOT going to be charged to repaint the apartment because there were no alterations to the walls), $50 for light cleaning (I spent 4 hrs before the inspection cleaning the place top to bottom), and $12 for the drip pans on the stove.  Be prepared to be charged to ready the apartment for the next tenant even though there was minimal damage, if any, to the actual unit.  Be prepared to have your deposit taken and to owe them more money.  Thankfully they didn't charge me for the chicken bone, hair filled drain, and dirty dryer I found when I moved in which would have brought the unit back to the "original move in condition."  Over all, my time here was a means to an end.  The apartment (at the time) was affordable, centrally located, and manageable for a single woman.

Beckets is a great addition to Arcadia and with a couple visits under my belt I figured I should add my review to Yelp.  I love their drink selection, lots of tasty and fresh combinations as well as local beer selection (yah!) and a great wine list.  The food is hearty and has good flavor.  The grits are great but are more of a sausage dish than grits.  The chef loves his stone ground mustard and it is feature in a lot of the dishes there.  I wish they had more salad options on the menu (only 3) but all of the other dishes I have tried have been very good.  A MUST try is their chocolate covered bacon s'mores dessert, it will change your life.  The service is great but can be a little too attentive.  It is nice to have your water refilled but often the server assistant is refilling it after I have taken a drink, it is ok to let me get  1/2 way through my glass before you jump to refill it.  I also wish they would open a little earlier than 5 PM, if I want an early dinner then I have to look elsewhere unless I want to wait until they unlock the doors for service.

One of the words in the name of this place correctly describes it and it isn't "spaghetti".  We came here for a wedding reception and were just kind of whelmed with the experience.  First off, lets call a spade a spade. This place is CHEAP. All their meals come with bread and a salad/soup and spumoni ice cream for dessert for under $15. Their current special is a 4 course meal for 2 for $25 so they definitely have a target demographic.   The venue itself was nice and clean but there was a large wait at 7 PM so be early or be prepared to wait.  We had a back room that was very large and could accommodate very large parties. The servers were nice but a bit inexperienced. I ordered a chardonnay, received a pinot nior. We were served by table and both times food was delivered (salad and entree) someone at our table was left out and had to grab a server to get their meal.  We were offered 3 choices of of entrees. Mine was very bland, I had the fettuccine Alfredo which was low on taste and on sauce. The Boy got the Chicken Marsala which was a bit better, the side of Mizithra Spaghetti was to die for but the Marsala sauce tasted pre-made and the chicken portion was small.  ​This place is good if you are looking to eat on the cheap, if your in-laws are in town, or if you are a High Schooler ​going to Prom. Spend a little more $$$ and go to Rigatony's instead.

Had lunch here with the coworkers and pretty sure I am going to dream of this place later tonight when I fall asleep.  The menu boasts 13 different "dawg" choices as well as burgers, pastrami, Polish beef, Philly cheese steaks, salads wraps for the weak people and non fried goodness from the oven of fries, tots, and onion rings.  I ordered the Texas Dawg which was the dog, onion, cheddar cheese, bacon, onion rings and BBQ sauce but asked to omit the BBQ which they were happy to oblige.  The owner brought out our orders and was hilarious giving us all a hard time for the ingredient omissions we all asked for.  My Texas Dawg was shortened to a Tex Dawg since I 86'd the BBQ and my friends Chicago Dawg was shortened to a Chhhhhhh Dawg since she asked for no mustard, relish or peppers.  My work lunch group has been looking for authentic Sonora Dawg for around 6 months now and we were excited to see the DawgFather offered one.  A lot of other places claim to have them but the bacon needs to be WRAPPED around the dog while it is cooked, not just included in the bun and the DawgFather version did not disappoint.  The place is small so if you have a big entourage, you might have to stand outside but there are booths and tables inside as well as out in front.  Dawgs are made to order so they do take some time but are def worth the wait so be patient!  No beer /wine/liquor as of yet but the owner talked with us about possibly making the place BYOB so the alchys like me can enjoy their Dawg with a nice cold one.  The Dawg Father is a must if you are in the CenPho area and a can't miss for hot dog fans, a great find!

I have dreams about Tacos Atoyac and they are the types of dreams you don't talk about.  I used to work close by to TA so I would come at least once a week to have lunch.  The Owner was always behind the register and always remembered my order (1 fish taco and an Oaxacan Hot dog).  He even remembered how I like my food (no tomatoes, no jalapenos, no side of grilled onions/peppers).  My go to is the Oaxacan dog!  Even though bacon is sprinkled on and not cooked with the hot dog it is the BEST hotdog I have ever had!  They also toast the bun before the bean shmear which really makes all the difference.  Pair it with a Mexican Coke and you've got yourself the best day of your life.  The building/location itself is a little scary.  I went there a few weeks after it opened and I will say I had my doubts (I thought i would get robbed) but the place won me over and I would brave all scary things in this world to get my TA fix on.  My secret suggestion is always get a churro for the road.

Came here for a change of pace activity with the boy and had a great time!  We rented a double kayak but there are several options to choose from including stand up paddle boards, paddle boats, and electric passenger boats.  If you are looking for something with a little more horse power, they have motor based boats, jet skis and Fly Boards rentals at their Lake Pleasant location.  Their staff was very polite and knowledgeable.  The gentleman who helped us with our Kayak had a lot of kayaking experience and even spent a month in Alaska kayaking through the wilderness.  He gave us some great tips and technique suggestions and sent us on our way.  They also provide life jackets but as adults, we weren't required to wear them.  Some people balk at Tempe Town Lake due to its color and odor but we had a great trip and it was closer than driving to the local reservoir/lakes.   We kayaked for an hour and with the $5 manager's special, our total with tax was $23 and change.  They even have a frequent rental program for those looking to rent on the regular.  Just a reminder for the summer, they stop renting during peak sun hours due to the summer heat so be sure you get there before 11 AM if you would like to rent.  They still have someone staffed for rental returns during this time, but they do not rent from 11-5 PM during the week days in the summer.  Don't forget the sunscreen!

There is a place called Heaven, and it is a Bosa glazed donut.  The donut holes are the best and a real deal at 12 for $0.99.  It's not a quick stop though, Arcadia loves them some Bosa so there is always a line in the drive through.  But the wait in line for a fluffy pillow that is a Bosa donut is soooooo worth it.

Grimaldi's has always been one of my fav pizza places in the Valley.  I love how each location installs a water softener/filter to get their water just the way it is at the NYC location for the best pizza dough.  My go to is their white pizza with Pesto.  I am also happy they have added the "chef selections" for pre-designed pizza ideas instead of having to make up your own.   The reason why I haven't give them 4 stars, and honestly its a little closer to 3.5 stars, is the price.  My pizza is relatively inexpensive but when the boy orders, I want to scream at him.  He adds all the toppings and the $9 personal pizza turns into a $20, 12" pizza.  Even the chef selections are $$$ with most of them being $16-$18 for.  And we cant order a large and do half and half because toppings are the same price for a whole pizza or a half.    I understand with price comes quality but it makes it hard to come here often when the bill is always $40+ for 2 small pizzas.  I just need to leave the boy at home.

I love me a good burger and 5 guys doesn't disappoint.  The burgers are ok for the price but the fries are a MUST order.  A regular order can feed 2-3 people because they don't skimp.  As a whole I would give this place 3 stars but they earned a 4th start for their online ordering system.  No waiting in line for this gal!

I LOVE NCounter!  They do breakfast well and have great dishes that are imaginative without going off the deep end.  If you like a Benedict and you are wild about cream cheese get the NCounter Omelets!  Seriously it is my go to item and it's like crack.  I also love that they have a protein smoothie on their menu so I enjoy my brunch with my man friend instead of getting stuck at some health food place.  With all this good food the place can get busy and slow which is the only negative thing I can say about it but I guess that is what happens when people find out that your food is freaking amazing.  I also love that I can order online for my to-go order.  Makes my life a lot easier with a few clicks of a button!

I visit this location for lunch due to it being down the street from my work place.  It can be hit or miss but the misses tend to be frequent and consistent.  I LOVE their Caesar salad, mostly because they use anchovies in their dressing making it a true Caesar.  Their menu is not my jam, too much peppers and SW spice so I tend to stick to the same things on their menu which is the Caesar salad and pizza.  Their pizza cookie is a fav as well and it is a nice touch that they offer a complimentary one on your birthday.  The frequent and consistent problem I have is the freshness of the romaine lettuce.  Each time I get a salad there, I get old lettuce that is either so old it dried out and is crispy, or is so old it is on the verge of turning into slime.  They have a giant bin of lettuce that you can see in their kitchen so they are either not doing a good job of cleaning it, or are using old lettuce with the new.  I now go through my salad and pick out the old pieces so I don't get a surprise while I am eating.

Now they are using a hand held drill to buff toenails during their pedi instead of just a quick file.  I can definitely see grow out difference on my nail bed.  Not good.

Grabbed one of their bacon and egg Squarz at the Ahwatukee Farmers market and I wish I would have grabbed 10.  The filling was a little dry but the pastry was just plain delicious, the right combo of flaky and buttery.  I love that they deliver, have a brick and mortar restaurant, have frozen take home, AND hit up the Farmers Market.  All the ways to get my Squarz fix!

Bagel Man, you have stolen my heart with your chewy bagel deliciousness.  Although his shop may not be as fancy as other places, his bagels and cream cheese are far above the other bagel shops here in PHX.  My go to there is a bagel with cream cheese and depending on what they have in stock (WARNING! They can run out early) either a plain bagel with lox cream cheese (real lox, not this fake stuff with artificial smoke flavor) or a salt bagel with regular cream cheese.  Not only do you get a delish bagel but you get it on the cheap, $1 bagel,  13 for $10, and a bagel with cream cheese starts at $2.25.  I haven't had any of his sandwiches but by lunch time, he often is out of bagels so go early.  There have been times I have gone at 12:15 and there were 6 bagels left, I have gone at 11:00 and there are 6 bagels left, the earlier the better with this place.  The Bagel Man actually cares about his business and his customers.  Often he will come by the tables and chat, asking if this is our first time and I always say "no, I'm just wearing makeup today."

Update on my review, still 5 stars! Love this place and come several times a week.  I have no idea why you would go to any other bagel place in a 5 mile radius, well except on Mondays when they are closed.  My suggestion is a Bacon, Egg, and Cheese on a Cinnamon Raisin, it will change your life.  The Boy loves their Scrambled Eggs with Lox sandwich which is an amazing deal.  His sandwich is always loaded up and feels like it weights pounds.  The Boy and I always say we wish we would try their lunch sandwiches but I love their bagels by themselves so I stick with that.  They have had a minor change in prices so the older photos of the menu are out of date but don't let that stop you from visiting.  All the Points to Bagel Man!

The staff at Snyder and Wenner are passionate about helping those who have been harmed due to medical malpractice and are an asset to anyone looking for legal counsel.  They handle cases throughout the US but they are dedicated locally to the Phoenix area.  I would recommend them to anyone who questions the medical care they or a family member received.

If this concept was in a big city it would be a hit but this is Old Town.  We got there around midnight on a Friday and called the # and was told it would be 15-20 min and we should wait at the bottom of the stairs.  I don't mind waiting but the bottom of the stairs is right next to the smelly dumpster that has been sitting in the 110 degree sun all day.  My friend got tired of the smell and moved up to the top landing only to be chased back down by the hostess when she went to let out another group of people. After 20 min we finally get called and head upstairs.  The cocktail list is AMAZING but be prepared to wait, our first round of 3 drinks took 15 min to get.  The place wasn't busy at all.  It seats 30 but there were maybe 12 people there.  They also have a separate late night menu than the one listed on the drink menu so we had to wait for the new menu before we could rethink our order.  I know it was their late night menu but it left a lot to be desired and if you don't like pork there is like 1 option for you in the hummus plate.  I got the porkbelly bahn Mi which was mediocre.  No flavor from the pork at all and the pickled vegetables overwhelmed the entire sandwich.  The speak easy concept is interesting but I don't know how it would ever work at this location  Guys aren't allowed to approach girls but are encouraged to send drinks to a lady they may be interested in.  With only 30 people in the room, that doesn't leave a lot of room for interaction with strangers.  Also would have been nice to be informed of the 20% service charge automatically added to all drinks.  Auto Grat makes for lazy servers.

Mod Home is a cool place if you are looking for modern (duh) or eclectic pieces you wouldn't find in a regular furniture store.  This place has something for every style from Art Decco, to fuzzy pillows, to minimal modern pieces, to giant decorative busts, they even have a framing area to order custom picture frames.  Somethings are a little far out there, like an Egg Chair from Men in Black, but everything seemed to be of high quality and well done.  The sales people were nice, not pushing, but also didn't seem to care that we were there.  We caught one sitting on a couch taking a selfie as we walked by and the rest hovered by the sales station up front.  Prices were very reasonable compared to other big box retailers with a very large, diverse selection.  Will definitely be back if we need any mod furniture.

This guy is AWESOME!  Yes all capital letters AWESOME!  We saw him perform at the yelp PleY date and wanted to pull up a chair and watch him all night.  He was entertaining, engaging and also talented with balloon art (no crappy giraffes here).  I want to throw a party just so I have a reason to hire him.

Do you love Beer?  Do you love Brauts? Do you love Bocce?  Do you love Bing Pong (sorry I needed another B word there)?  The Brat Haus is the place for you!  Brat Haus is the kind of place you love to give your money to because they are passionate about what they do.  From the awesome food they serve, to the fact that EVERY beer on tap is served in its appropriate style of glass direct from the brewer themselves, this place gets it right.  My go to items are their cheese curds, the Brat Burger (yum!), there fries with Truffled Aioli sauce (careful, the large fries is HUGE), their home made mustard, and their hand crafted brats.  Their patio is HUGE and is a fun time.  Plus the place is dog friend and dog loved (dogs eat free on Sundays!) so this is a must do on my list of old town.  Only gripe was parking (street only) but now that they have bought the restaurant next door, that is no longer a problem!  Say this in your best Arnold Schwarzenegger voice: GET TO THE BRAT HAUS!

I used Parker's Movers back when they were known as "Smooth Moves" and would recommend them to anyone!  ​As a woman of small stature, I have trouble moving anything larger than a bread box, there in lies the problem with moving.  You don't want to ask your friends because they will hate you.  You don't want to hire moving company because they will nickle and dime you for everything from the cost of them to put gas in the truck to get to your place to the wear and tear of the truck driving to your place.  This is where Parker's Movers shines.  I was able to rent a truck at U-Haul and use them to do the heavy lifting!  I reserved 2 movers for 90 min and they were able to move all my big stuff from a one bedroom apartment in no time.  The owner was great with communication and concerns which I really appreciated.  One thing that sets them apart from other "corporate movers" is their knowledge and attention to detail.  Both gentlemen cared about my stuff and brought a long moving supplies (dolly, tarps, blankets) so I didn't incur extra costs renting them from U-Haul.  They were well trained and knew exactly how to load my things in the truck to minimize damage during transport.  They were polite, hustled, and did an amazing job.  I joked and called them my "friend savers" because it was cheaper to rent their services than it was to hassle my friends.  And my friends appreciated not being asked to help me move.  It was win win for everyone and I was moved for less than $150 with their services and the truck rental.  I would recommend Parker's Movers to anyone for any moving needs, large or small.

I have been a fan of the Bistro Family since their sister restaurant, Local Bistro, opened in the Grey Hawk area.  I was super excited when Central Bistro brought their love to the Arcadia area.  All of their menu items are crazy delicious but my friend and I stopped by to take advantage of their Social Hour deals which do not disappoint.  Its a nice touch that they offer extended hours on their Social Hour as well as all day Social Hour on Mondays.   My friend loves Oysters and was very happy to find that they had both east and west coast options available for the Social Hour special ($1 Oysters!) and could mix and match for her order.  Our server was also very helpful to coordinate the oysters coming out later in the meal (my friend wanted to wait to have the oysters when she ordered a glass of wine).  The Drunk Bread is a go to and I was very happy with the Simple Frites, the right about of crispy with a soft center.  The mixed drinks were well done as well.  My friend found the Strawberry Smash to be a little too sweet for her and our server was happy to accommodate her with a new drink and remove the strawberry one from our bill.    The only misstep we have experience here is with the bussing staff.  I appreciate a busser who is on top of his game, but not when they are so quick to take your plate that there is still food left on it.  We have had this issue a couple times now and its disappointing to miss out on that last bite or last sip of booze.  All in all, a great, local addition to the Arcadia Area!

I was a first timer at Drybar but not a first timer for a blow out.  I really enjoyed my experience.  My stylist help me pick a style based on my hair cut (I wanted curls but wasn't sure which of their styles would match my blunt cut) and I was not disappointed with the result.  My stylist did an amazing job on my wash, and gave me a really nice scalp massage.  She was also quick to check if I was tender headed and how my hair took heat.  Another reviewer mentioned it is hard to chit chat because of all the hair dryers going, but they had magazines and a TV playing 500 Days of Summer (with closed captions on, of course) to help pass the time.  My style held up all day, even in the humidity of the oncoming monsoon.  Not sure if I will be back, mostly because of the price tag.  $40 is a lot to spend on getting your hair washed and styled, my Aveda stylist charges me $50 for a cut.  I will definitely be back if I have a special occasion i need a special 'do for, these ladies really know their styles!

If you haven't been to P&P, you are missing out!  P&P has straight forward food with an elegant twist, most focusing on pork (duh) as well as some fish and beef dishes.  You have your standard dishes like the BLT or Shrimp and Grist but also some great dishes for those adventurous eaters like Pork Liver Smear or Wood Oven Roasted Bone Marrow.  It sounds odd to recommend Brussel sprouts at a house of pork but GET THE SPROUTS!  With the fried egg (and add bacon) the crispy and tender sprouts are amazing.  I was also very impressed with the Beer Cheese soup. So many places the soup is sour or under seasoned but this soup was thick, salty, and the right amount of taste.  My friends also go the Porchetta, Crispy Skin Trout, Dump Truck Salad, and the Apocalypse Sow and everyone was pleased with their dishes.  I had the Quinoa salad, which I am sure I would have liked on another occasion, but since I had all the flavors of the sprouts and beer cheese soup, it came up lacking.  Also they substituted fennel instead of red onion which was disappointing because I am not a fennel fan.  Their drink menu was awesome but a bit intimidating.  They have close to 40+ beers in both bottle and draft and 16 handcrafted drinks to choose from as well as wine by the glass and the bottle.  Our waiter was more than happy to offer suggestions but that many choices did add some anxiety to the drink order.  One last note, even though you are stuffed full of pork goodness, still take a peek at the dessert menu.  We all enjoyed the lavender crème brule and am glad we all made room for it.  All in all, a great meal was had by all.

Another Great dinner at P&P.  We had a small hiccup during service, but our server and the management address it and all was forgiven.  Our server, Cat, was AMAZING.  She made great recommendations that the table talked about for the rest of the night.  She recommended the special, a Pork "Chicken Wing" which everyone raved over (sorry, I'm not a wing girl).  In closing, THEY HAVE PUMPKIN PORTER ON TAP!  ON TAP IN JUNE!  I REPEAT, THIS IS NOT A DRILL.  Their management is smart like a fox and set aside 2 kegs when they got it in last fall.  Not sure for how long but this is your warning to get there now!

Before I start my review, this is a SCHOOL.  These are students who are learning a craft and by going there, you should understand the services may not be perfect.  It blows my mind how many bad reviews there are for students who are trying to learn a trade and need practice to learn that trade.  They are not experts (yet) and will make mistakes, take longer to do the services, and have to check their work with the Cosmo Prof on the floor before you can leave to get clock hours for the service.  I've been to the Aveda school on several occasions and have enjoyed my experiences.  I normally go to a full service Aveda salon but sometimes it's $$$$ to pay Aveda prices.  That is why I love the school, I get a discounted rate on services ($15 for a cut and style vs $55) but still get the same great Aveda based techniques and products.  I save the heavy lifting for my Aveda stylist but often come to the school for blowouts and other minor services.  Here are some tips when booking services with the Aveda School:  -Bring cash, you can pay for the services via debit/credit card but tips can NOT be added and must be paid in cash  -Services run long, especially if there are lot of students on the floor and limited instructors to check work.  A service that usually takes an hr will take at least and extra 15-20 min  -Book online!  Request your service online through their website and never have to talk to a person/wait on hold.  -The students are learning how to introduce/up-sell products to potential clients and they need to practice that as well. It's ok to skip the product basket at the end, but be aware they need practice there, too.  -Tell the student how you do your own hair (ie: my hair takes heat really well, I have a sensitive scalp, I don't like a lot of product) again they are LEARNING and any info you can give them helps them with better client interaction  -If you are requesting a more complicated service, request a master student  -Listen when the instructors come to evaluate the student's work, I have gotten some great styling tips for myself just by listening to the Instructor's technique suggestions  -Be patient and understanding

Stopped by here last night and this business has gone out of business.  Signs on the front door said this location is permanently closed, not sure if there is another location that is still open?  Their website and FB are also gone.

I have been wanting to try this place for years and finally had a chance to get here.  Being from the Midwest, I grew up with all sorts of Northern European dishes and Beaver Choice did not disappoint!  We were greeted by a wonderfully pleasant woman who is the owner.  She is the type of lady who is so sweet and positive, you just want to hug her.  We spent a little time at the bar, the wine menu is a little limited and the pours small, but the beer selection was awesome, a lot of imports from all over Europe.  ​We were seated and had issues with the service throughout the night.  Our server was slow, slow to take our order, slow to come check on us, and seemed to avoid our table in general.  We also had issue with our entrees coming out and missing some items, or just missing entrees entirely.  We ordered some appetizers and received a plate of complimentary perogis to share.  I ordered the Scandinavian Sampler (Swedish Meatballs, Gravlax, and a Mini Shoemaker's Box) while the boy ordered the Polish Sampler.  Our server did not ask anyone what kind of Perogis they wanted or tell us what flavors were available that day.  All the food was great and reminded me of all the comfort food I ate growing up. Each dish came with 1 large side and 3 smaller sides.  I loved their potato salad and their horseradish and beets were awesome!​  The Boy shared some of his Polish Sausage with me (get your mind out of the gutter) and it was a must order as well.  Crisp snap of the casing and good flavor for the meat.  Will definitely be back, I suggest making a reservation as the place is on the medium small side.  I really want to come back on Thursday for their unlimited Soup, Salad, and Perogi special for $11.95. I hope they iron out the serving situation, it was the only thing keeping them for 5 stars with this review.

Order in, drive through this place is the go to in Arcadia for a great burger (ok I didn't mean to make that rhyme).  They "get" great customer service and always ask for my name when I order even in the drive through.  I haven't had a chance to try a shake yet mostly because I save my calories for a Standard with Cheese and fries.  They are also always happy to modify my burger as I am not a lettuce, tomato, onion fan.  Only gripe is they use a lot of pepper on both the burger and on the fries.  I like well seasoned but the beef is amazing and flavorful so no need to add anything else.  Same with the fries, salt is all you need!

We came to Steak 44 for a friend's birthday and experienced some "hits" but also many misses.  I have eaten at their sister (ok Mother ship) Dominick's in the Scottsdale Quarter and am familiar with the brand.  We had a large party of 22 to celebrate a birthday and it was nice that the restaurant was able to accommodate us.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is very intimate and a nice place to bring a date.  We were whisked through the kitchen back to a private(ish) room. I say ish because it was our party of 22 and another party of 10 who were also celebrating a birthday.  While sitting down, the birthday boy clarified with the hostess that we were indeed set up for 22 people and she confirmed yes.  Upon seating, we realized we were only set for 17 and needed to squish together to fit 5 more people.  I at first was a little miffed by my $19 Kettle One on the rocks, but was delivered a shaker that contained more booze so really I got closer to 2 drinks.  The blue cheese stuffed olives were also a nice touch.  My dining companion and I decided to order an appetizer and were not disappointed with the fried deviled eggs.  We ordered the 4, which we perfect to share, but wished we had ordered the 6 instead they were that good.  We also decided to split their special that night, a 22 oz Bone-In Ribeye accompanied with 3 diver scallops in a brown butter and ordered the Dominick's Potatoes and the Brussel Sprout sides.  Here is the problem I have with Dominick's and now Steak 44, I get steak envy.  Other guests who ordered the same exact cut, the same exact temp, often have larger cuts of meat and I end up with the piece the looks like it was the end cap of the cut.  I know steaks can vary due to temp and hand cut steaks at that, but it always seems like I get the hacked piece while my friend's get works of art.  We both enjoyed the cheesy potatoes but the Brussels came up lacking, they should definitely remove the "get these" from the dish description.  Here comes more of the "misses".  We had two servers for our table, one gave a completely different explanation of the specials than the other (our server said the scallops were cooked with olive oil and S&P while the other mentioned brown butter, two totally different things).  Orders were taken in waves and menus were removed once an order was taken but they still managed to miss 2 of our party who had to flag them down to place their order.  We also had to request bread which is normally brought out before the meal.  Our server was polite enough to let us know he did not charge us gratuity, but pointed out we were charged a 4% administrative fee for the hostesses setting up our table.  Between everyone at the table we paid $80-100 to the hostess for our table to be set up, the table that was set up incorrectly.  Finally, even though we had 2 servers, checks took forever to come out and to be run.  The ambiance was nice but I prefer Dominick's to Steak 44.  The live music at Dominick's is way more appealing than the hits of the 80's, 90's, and Today that was played at Steak 44.  Nothing beats listening to the Boss sing "Born in the USA" while you eat a $60 steak.  This review is closer to a 3 star but because I'd rather eat at other locally owned steaks houses instead of Steak 44 it's getting a down grade.  The 2 star review is because of the many misses of the evening, if you want to be 5 stars then experience should seamless.

I wasn't overwhelmed, I wasn't underwhelmed, I was just whelmed by Classic Cakes and Confections Bakery, hence the meh rating.  I had family in town visiting who invited me over for dinner last minute and I couldn't show up empty handed.  I contemplated heading to a corporate cupcake place that shall not be named but I like to support local businesses so decided to give CC&C a try.  They had small and medium sized cakes and tarts ranging from $12-20+ and an array of baked deliciousness like cookies, brownies, and pastries.  They also had AMAZING wedding cake models in store that are custom orders.    Walking up they had a sandwich board sign saying "cupcakes buy one, get one free" and inside there was a sign that said cupcakes were 2 for $5 so I asked to take all they had left which was 12 cupcakes.  My total bill came to $33 and I was very confused.  Cupcakes were BOGO free and the sign said 2 for $5 so I expected to pay $16 for the cupcakes.  The cashier explained that the cupcakes are normally priced $4.50-$5 so the BOGO and the 2 for $5 were the same thing.  Huh?  $5 for a cupcake?  I asked why there were 2 different signs indicating differently and his answer was "I didn't want to have to redo the inside sign for the cupcakes."  I ended up getting 6 of the only 3 flavors they had left, raspberry cake with vanilla frosting, vanilla cake with strawberry frosting, and almond cake with vanilla frosting.  This is where the whelmed comes in, they were ok.  Not great, not bad but just ok and definitely not worth $5.  I am not sure what kind of frosting they were topped with, it was lighter than a butter cream and closer to marshmallow fluff consistency.    I do want to go back and try some of their other baked goods because they looked amazing but definitely not going to be ordering cupcakes again unless I'm ready to just be whelmed.  So much for shopping local.

We came here on a whim after another restaurant had a 45 min wait on a Friday night and had a very nice time.  There were a few hiccups, which are to be expected at this type of establishment, but over all we were very impressed.  The boy ordered a T-Bone and I ordered their Great American Steak Dinner, which is their feature special.  When the steaks came out, my MR was more MW and I waited for our server to come back.  One of the other servers noticed I wasn't eating my steak and came over to check on us, which was a nice touch.  While I waited on my refire, I had some of the Boy's T-Bone and was blown away.  The steak was tender and had amazing flavor and was one of the better steaks I have had in a long time.  Even with the missteps, we were very happy with the service and with our food.  Will definitely be back the next time we need a steak fix!

I have been wanting to try The Attic for years (not exaggerating) but for some reason I never made it.  This has always been one of my fav Arcadia locations (those views!) and was very sad that the Italian place that was here before The Attic couldn't make it work.  I am kicking myself now for not coming sooner, this place is AMAZING!  Me and The Boy were in the mood for burgers and I remembered The Attic was known for their burgers.  We missed their Wednesday Ivan Burger Special (An Ivan and a Beer for $12) but they had a fun Thursday special (Pizza and a beer/glass of wine for $12) the night we came. But we mean business, we wanted beef so we each got the Ivan Burger.  The burgers came and this was my reaction:  ahisuxdhlaiwudhail wduhaliduha;owdh;ao widhiauwgdilawhdnua;whduhawlidughaliwudgaliwdhuilawdgiuawgdliuagwdilugalweruigaliug.  The flavors were amazing, the burger was cooked perfectly, great meat quality, and the fries were the right combo of crispy on the outside with soft potato inside.  We were also very impressed with the beer selection. At the time we were there, they were featuring Avery Beers and had a lot of fun, flavorful brews.  Our server, Cheryl, was also knowledgeable about the brew selection, had a great attitude, and was very prompt with our service.  Only two areas of concern.  First, as always, are underage bus boys.  Underage Bus boys work hard and mean well, but they are quick to snatch my glass of beer off the table as soon as it gets below 1/4 of a glass. They're young, they don't understand the magic of finishing your drink but I get tired of having to fight for my last sips of brew.  The second concern was the time it took to get our food.  Perfection can not be rushed but our two burgers took 25+ minutes on a Thursday night, time we had not budgeted for with another evening engagement.  Over all, great food, great service, and we can't wait to come back for another burger.

We came back to the Attic for their Wednesday $12 Ivan and a Beer special and left two very happy and full campers.  Great service, great beer selection (The Avery Tweak was amazeballs, 17.5% ABV and delish if you like darker coffee/espresso type flavors), and great burgers once again.  We both chose to upgrade our beers to a fancier variety for only $2 more than the $12 special but still made it out of there dinner for 2 for $30.  I actually sent my friends a picture of my burger to taunt them.  It worked. Now my friends don'y like me and want to come to The Attic.

I come to America's strictly for their beans but want to stop coming here because of their staff.  This review is several months in the making, I have a 30 min lunch break so time is of the essence when it comes to getting food.  I will place an online order 30+ min in advance, only to get there and find it has not been made or even started cooking yet. Queue a 10-20 min wait while they prepare it and most of my lunch is down the toilet.  My coworker has even resorted to typing "please make sure food is ready on time" in the special instructions notes on the online ordering form.  Besides the long prep time, orders have been incorrect, items have been left out, it takes 4 or 5 times of repeat spelling of my name for them to start my order (S as in Sam, E-R-I), and most recently the to go lid was loose on my beans and most of them ended up inside the to go bag.  Wait you say, wouldn't gravity stop the beans from leaking?  Not when the server places the to go container on its side in the bag instead of right side up.  I now have a nice oil stain on my front seat from the leak.  The place is hardly busy so being in the weeds is not a plausible excuse.  Either better train your employees, or find competent staff.  Tacos are not Rock Science.

The Boy and I decided we earned another cheat meal this week (ok we really didn't) and we spent it a the Gladly.  We came on Sunday and had a pleasant surprise of all day Happy Hour on Sunday until 6 PM.  Don't threaten me with a good time.    The food was on point, as always.  The Boy ordered their smoked wings from the HH menu and the Roasted Brussel Sprouts.  I ordered their ridiculously crave-able Original Chopped Salad.  The boy loved his wings, the brussels were good, a bit tough, but the sweat corn grits saved the day.  We also tried the Noble Bread appetizer which was good but our eyes were too big for our stomachs.  Drinks were awesome, I got the $5 rosé from HH and The Boy tried the Beginners Luck off their Barrel Aged menu.  The service was iffy.  It's Sunday so I am not expecting to be wowed but the girl who stirred my salad took the rest of the dressing off the table when she left.  I requested more from our server but it never came.  Service was slow and infrequent.  The atmosphere was laid back but that doesn't mean the service should be.  We enjoyed our experience and will be back.

I am not good with blood, like at all, so when my doc suggested I get some yearly labs done I cringed and thought about "accidentally" losing the 'script.  Everything thing about my experience with Sonora Quest helped ease my fears.  This location takes appointments which is AWESOME!  No getting there at 7 AM and hoping there aren't 20 "regulars" there that you have to wait behind while praying you can make it to work on time.  I booked online, was in and out and on my way to work in no time.  The staff was pleasant, especially my phlebotomist, Maria.  I told her my feelings about blood draws and she made sure I was ok, distracted me to put me at ease, and was genuinely caring towards me.  She was very good at her job and I had very little discomfort other than the needle stick.  Would definitely recommend this location and visit again (just not by my choice, blood ick!).

We didn't actually go into Magic Mattress, mostly because we were heckled by their sales people on our way next door to R&S mattress.  The associates were combative and rude when they realized we had no intention of stopping there, and even heckled "I guess you don't want to buy a brand new mattress and you are ok to sleep on a used, rebuilt one" as we walked into R&S.  I respect the hustle, but I don't respect rude people just in it for the sale.  Avoid this place.

The Boy and I decided to try Ingo's for their 4th of July Special, $4 burgers.  I have warred with this place since it was built and took away the already scant parking for LGO and Postino's but I think it's time to wave the white flag and concede to Ingo's Tasty Food.  The place is small and quaint, inside is diner counter style eating with a nice shady patio outside.  The menu is, well, small, but we enjoyed what we had.  We started with the Post It Special of the day, Avocado Toast with Burrata, Heirloom Tomatoes, Grapes, Shallots, and Basil on Noble bread.  It was crazy delicious but the portion size was tiny for the $8 price tag.  Just once slice of bread with toppings.  Our burgers were very good, I had the Farmer's Daughter sans sauerkraut and The Boy had the Paris TX Burger.  The Shattered chips were just ok.  I like crispy, thin, potato chips and these were thick and soggy with some and thin and crispy with others.   What really won me over is the complimentary bite sized Sea Salt Chocolate Chip cookie they bring you at the end of your meal.  I mean I still went over to LGO and bought the large version to take home but it was a nice ending to a meal to satisfy a sweet tooth.

I should have read the reviews before we came here.  I love Happy Hour, and I love places that give you time to enjoy happy hour which is why we chose to visit the Watershed on a Friday night.  The location is awesome, right on the water with amazing views of the sunset.  The place is huge and would be a great venue for a special event like a wedding or birthday.   We arrived a few min after 6 PM and already the patio is full up, we were quoted a 30 min wait. I hate pointing out empty tables, there were several on the patio, so we chose to sit inside instead.  We're hungry, right?  The waitress says she can't seat us yet (even though the place is empty) and suggests we go to the bar first for a drink.  Ummm, ok?  We get to the bar and are promptly greeted by the bartender (battery operated motorized wine openers, really? Is it that hard your need a machine to do it for you?)  We order off the happy hour menu only to find out they are out of Sangria.  Out?  At 6:10 PM on a Friday?  By now the hostess finally got things figured out and we are seated.  We are seated and try to order drinks again with our server but guess what, they are out of Frozen drinks!  I order a regular drink and the boy orders a beer, both on happy hour and in stock. By now, we've been in the establishment for 20 min with no drinks, not even water.  We decide to start with the Chilli Cheese fries which comes with your choice of Chili or Chile, see what they did there?  Except we weren't given a choice, our server disappeared and we got Chili fries which were 70% beans.  The Boy was dying to try to their Green Chile Meatloaf Double Double and it was amazing!  He was so happy with the side of veggie upgrade told me to quote him in this review "Peppers, Onions, Zucchini, usually they do some played out, lame, broccoli/cauliflower/carrot mix but this is really good."  I am not a green chili fan and I had a bite and it was indeed, really, really, good!  I ordered the calamari which was just meh and was served cold, not fresh out of the fryer.  Here comes where I should have read the other reviews.  It took almost 45 minutes for us to get our meal and this place was no where even close to busy. This is 45 min after we got our appetizer.  I could have sent my cold calamari back but I wasn't sure how long it would take for me to get a refire.  I noticed other tables who had been seated since we got in finally getting their entrees after a long wait.  This is not good.  Things were good, but there were so many timing issues and things being out of stock.  Come here for the view (and the Green Chile Meatloaf) but don't come if you are hungry.

When I first looked at going to Little Miss, they had over 386 Yelp reviews and still maintained a 5 Star rating.  Not a 4.5, not a 4.7, but a 5 freaking star rating and I knew I had to find this Unicorn.  The first time we went, we got there at 10:30 and there were already 40 people deep in line.  The parking lot attendant (father in law of the owner) directed us to a spot and handed us a water.  They have picnic tables set up for outdoor eating as well as a few chairs scattered  here and there to help  break up the wait.  That Saturday, we waited close to an hour after they opened (90 min wait total) before we even got in the door.  The first few people inline move slowly because they order lbs to go and it takes time to slice and weight.  The owner is the one carving and takes the time to interact with each guest.  He even serves the coveted burnt end pieces to people in line as a taste before they order.  My tip?  Ask him what he feels is good today, he knows his stuff and it is the easiest way to ensure you get the best stuff.  My fav is the fatty brisket but that goes QUICK and my go to sides are the Potato Salad and Cheesy Grits, the coleslaw was a bit meh but still good.  Be sure to save room because their Pecan Pie is a must!  The last few times we have been going earlier, around 10:15 and have been in, ordered, and out the door by 12:00.  They will take call ahead orders but require a 5 lb min purchase which unless you have  a lot of friends, it can get a bit pricy so I choose to brave the line.  The team at Little Miss loves BBQ and it shows!  They are personable, caring, and thankful of their success and it really shows in the overall experience.  Keep up the good work!

Needed a Pedicure on a Sunday so decided to try out Shayna's Nails.  As a walk in I was promptly greeted and seated in a chair with in a few min.  First impression were good, the place was very clean and PACKED (always a good sign).  The polish selection was lacking, it looked dated and some of the names I recognized as last year's  colors but I brought my own so no biggie.  My other grip besides the dated polish selection was the dated magazines.  I get I am in the suburbs but all they had was In Style and Good Housekeeping, after digging I found a People but it was from November 2014.  I like a little trash reading while I luxuriate and appreciate better selections.    My tech was very sweet and very personable.  She made sure to intro herself and asked my name (which she remembered when I left).  She was sure to ask about the pressure of my service and joked with me throughout my pedicure.  She took her time with my leg massage and was very thorough in cutting/shaping my nails.  The prices were reasonable and they got me right in as a walk in, will definitely be back.

Another 5 star review from Shayna's Nails because I get 5 Star treatment!  Kathy was amazing and actually remembered me.  It has been months since I came in yet she still remembered me, my preferences for services, and even the type of polish I use.  I did add a few bells and whistles to my treatment since it had been months since my feet say any love and affection but I was still out the door for under $35 sans tip.  They accept walk ins but I recommend calling because they can get busy.  Not a big fan of their polish selection but I always bring my own anyways.  This place is legit.  Sorry no pictures, no one wants to look at feet.

This place is hit or miss, it is the Cracker Barrel of fast casual bakeries.  I highly recommend their bread but their other bakery cases items do not taste home made, more frozen then thawed.  I love getting their Paesano bread, its like a sour dough with out the bitey sour.  It is my go to bread to make grilled cheese sandwiches and freezes very well so you don't have to hurry and use a loaf.  Their Hazelnut 12 Grain bread is Ah-Maz-ing but at a $6 price tag, is not a loaf I order often.  Come in early because they do clearance day old bread at the rack by the register.  Menu items are hit and miss.  I love the turkey bacon avocado salad but the bacon is pre-cooked bacon and sometimes the turkey portions, although large, are fatty and stringy pieces from the breast bone.  Some soups are good but rotate, are seasonal, or run out quickly and are substituted  Kneaders is on my list of places with amazing ranch dressing, you laugh but the ranch list is a real thing.  The reason for a less than stellar review is consistency.  Sometimes I have a great meal, other times quality is lacking.  Sometimes I get a decent sized piece of pie, other times it is a sliver.  Sometimes my slice of Triple Chocolate Cream pie comes with a crust, other times the server left it in the pie tin.   I also try to call ahead to check on bread items being in stock (learned my lesson after getting stuck in the drive through for 15 min when they ran out of bread) but no one answers the phone.  They offer online ordering but what is the point of ordering online, driving there, and finding out they were out because no one can answer the phone.  This place is good when its good but I never know what I am going to get.

I was so excited to try The Prune as my friends had raved about it and I left, 25 min later with 2 donuts and the urge to never go back.  I was intrigued by the made to order donut concept especially the hot out of fryer part.  Part of the 25 min was our fault, we decided to go on National Donut day which they had a special, buy a drink and get a free donut.  The place was packed, close to 30-40 people in the tiny space, most of which were standing in a line that never moved.  We somehow got to the front of the line, ordered our donuts and moved to the back of the store to wait on our 2, made to order donuts.  Even though the place was packed, the staff there seemed to have no sense of urgency to complete orders.  Since the line wasn't moving, they weren't overwhelmed with orders but no one really seemed to be making donuts.  There were 5 people working and 2 donut making stations set up but only one person at a time actually made the donuts and that was after they stared at the order form for a minute.    After the long wait, we finally got our donuts and left.  The donuts themselves were just ok, I've had better from a gas station (Casey's Donuts, if you are from the Midwest you know what I am talking about) and the whole experience was just not that great.  I'll stick to my local Bosa

After months of searching, we FINALLY found the right dining room set at Living Spaces.  We went everywhere (as you can see from my previous reviews) and were having no luck, either nice sets for $$$ or cheap, bad veneer work for $.  All of that went away when we stopped at Living Space.  Our sales rep, Eddie, was very helpful and friendly.  I had questions about pieces from variations of the same collection and he researched to see if they could accommodate me.  We ended up finding an awesome table, 4 chairs, a bench style seat, and a self-hiding leaf.  As we encountered at other stores, the bench was usually an add on price to the set price but not at LS.  We got the entire set for $595.00!  I was floored!  I had to do some thinking about the set because this deal seemed too good to be true.  Eddie was understanding and went through our options if we did decide to move forward.  The deal turned out to NOT be too good to be true and we came back the next weekend and bought the set.  If you purchase before 3 PM that day, you can take it home same day.  Otherwise you can pick it up the next business day.  We got it home and assembled it ourselves and were blown away.  The set is from/manufactured by Ashley Furniture and is HEAVY.  The set does utilize wood veneer but it is very well done.  The table is very solid (we almost couldn't flip it right side up after assembling it it is so heavy/solid) and looks amazing!  We will be back to LS in the future for sure!

I know I have been slacking on my Yelp reviews, The Boy and I are diet which explains the radio silence.  We get one cheat meal a week and decided to try Dozo for some Ramen Cheat.  We got thereat 8 PM on a Friday and the place was PACKED, always a good sign.  We didnt want to load up on food before the ramen so The Boy ordered the Gyoza, pan fried, and I order Escolar Nigri.  I have struggled to find good Escolar aka White Tuna aka Butterfish here in the Valley but this was amazing.  No fishy smell, no odd flavor, just buttery deliciousness.  I could have eaten it all night.  The Gyoza are a do not miss.  The pan fried bottoms were ah-may-zing, the perfect amount of light and crispy.   We each got Ramen for our entree, The Boy got the Spicy Miso with Chicken and I opted for Sho-yu Ramen with pork.  The broth was very good, the noodles a little but too al dente for my tastes but still good.  The piece of pork that came with my ramen was the best part of the dish.  I gave The Boy and taste and he regretted going chicken with his ramen but still liked his dish.  He really liked the spice of the Spicy Miso and finished his dish.  The service was a little slow so make sure you budget your time but everything else about Dozo was awesome!

I initially really loved Fired Pie until I realized the value for what I was ordering.  If you load on all the toppings as mentioned in other reviews, it is a steal but for people like me who get 1 or 2 toppings, it is an $8 personal pizza.  I normally would get the Sauce and Cheese pizza and that wasn't too bad at $6 but as soon as I asked to change anything, I was told it was custom and was charged the $8 fee.  When I say change anything I mean anything other than red sauce and cheese.  I often like to get Pesto sauce and cheese and was told this was a "custom pie" because Sauce and Cheese is red sauce only.  Another time I asked for a little extra cheese on my red sauce and cheese pizza (I had learned my lesson after the last up charge  to change to Pesto) and that magically became a "custom pie".  The pizzas are good but with the size and the thin crust I can eat one in one sitting.  For $18 with tax for 2 pizzas with no leftovers, I'd rather pay $20 at Grimaldi's and have cold pizza leftovers for breakfast.  At least Grimaldi's stays open past 9 PM.

Another Fired Fail at Fired Pire. We arrived 20 minutes before closing and there were 10 people ahead of us in line. Service was slow, there were people breaking down the kitchen instead of helping process orders.  The teenagers working there have no clue about food handling.  I watched one girl run her hands through her hair, multiple times, while packaging the to go food.  The workers are more focused on flirting with each other than customer service. The line team assembling the pizzas did not change out their gloves in between orders. Meat gloves went in the veggies over and over.  A lady in front of us actually complained about her pizza because 1/4th of it was charred black.  The girl she talked to didn't care that she was dissatisfied and said "Oh it's supposed to be that way". The lady clarified she was unhappy and said "It wasn't this burnt the last time we came here" and instead of addressing the complaint, the girl said "Sorry" and bee lined for the kitchen so she wouldn't have to deal with the woman anymore.   It took 25 min to get our pizzas from the moment we walked in the door to the moment we left.  They no longer offer parm cheese and peppers with to go orders so we had to hunt down the last remaining shakers they hadn't put away for the night. Our pizzas were soggy by the time we got home, 5 min later.    Why do people like this place?

Angry Crab is a great addition to the Arcadia Neighborhood!  I haven't had their BBQ but their seafood is awesome.  I usually go with Snow Crab, they are cheap and already cleaned for you unlike the Dungeness that come whole and need to be cleaned.  I also love their shrimp which are a steal per lb and HUGE!  I am talking prawn size, cooked whole head on with all the delicious juices.    I am a wuss when it comes to spice and I usually ask for a 0 but still feel some heat on my lips.  I also order some bread for soppin to get all those extra juices that are left on the table.  I am not a big shellfish person but my friend loved their raw bar oysters and the mussels.  Mondays are the best days to go for "Mixed Bag Mondays".  MBM is house choice of seafood plus mixed veggies for $20.  Get there for happy hour (3-7 PM) for cheap eats and cheaper booze.  This is my go to place when I have friends in town visiting or just a day to treat myself.

My previous brunch review was reported because of my discussion of the inappropriate attire of a waitress during our brunch visit.  Here is the condensed version and a new star rating.  Food: 5 (Delish!) Service: 2 (Our waitress was dressed well, other Waitress inappropriate attire and the bad bus boy brought it down from a 4.5) Ambiance: 2 (loud music, weird smell, and the heat) Booze: 4

We have been searching for a new mattress for a few months now and are at our wits end to find one.  I had heard the advertisements on the radio (Shout out to Holmberg shilling away for T&N) and decided to give T&N a chance.  Let's be honest, mattress shopping is gross.  You go to a place with crazy pushy sales people, lay on dirty beds in the same place that 1,000's of others have placed their heads, and are supposed to find a match?  No, just no.  Thankfully T&N gets all that and did away with the gross part of buying a mattress.  We were greeted and offered water (Fiji bottled water, oh you fancy).  We did have a 10 min wait due to it being a Saturday and all visitors are given a one on one consultation.  Our T&N associate took us back to our own private room, seriously, it was a room made up with a bed with sheets and pillows and we were left to our own to relax.  No pushy people looking for a sales reaction, no strangers watching you lay on a bed, just a room like you would see in any other home.  After a few min our associate came back (I think her name was Shelly?  I'm bad at names, see all my other reviews) and answers our questions about size, price, style of the bed.  She was super informative, helpful, super friendly, and not pushy in the least bit.  The best part about all of this?  While waiting for our turn with our associate, I watched a team member change the linens on the beds after every demonstration!  No overused stranger pillows.  No dirty footprint from the dude who decided to stand on the mattress to do the glass of wine test.  Just clean sheets between you and the mattress you are demoing.  This place knows what they're doing.

I don't like giving negative reviews but I have had nothing but bad experiences at this location. From frozen french friends as my side to dry chicken that has sat under a warmer.  My most recent visit only confirmed this review, old mac and cheese that was mushy and slimy, biscuits clearly under-cooked but was still served.  Avoid this place at all costs.

I don't like writing bad reviews so this will be short.  We came here on Saturday afternoon because Philly's does extended happy hour, 7 days per week.  Upon arrival, we find out they cancelled happy hour due to the UFC fight being shown even though the main event was still 2 hrs away.  We were there to cheap booze and grub and had no interest in the fight so we went to another sports bar for Happy Hour.  That sports bar was also showing the fight, but still had Happy Hour in place.

As a Midwesterner, I have been waiting since the announcement that Lou's was coming to the Valley.  I even taunted friends who have moved outside of the Chicagoland area that we have the first Lou's outside of IL and was extremely lucky to score a ticket to the soft opening.  First of all, Lou's deserves 10 stars for donating all proceeds of their soft opening to Phoenix Children's Hospital.  All participants of the soft opening paid for their food and Lou's then donated those funds to PCH.  Class Act.  Lou's in the desert is just as good as Lou's back home.  The boy tried the thin crust pizza (which almost seemed sacrilegious) but he said it was one of the best thin crusts he has ever had.  I got the Chicago Classic and it was just as good as I remembered.    The decor here is fun, they really did a nice job in the PHX mod feeling they added to the ambiance.  My only disappointment were the TV's in the dining room, definitely NOT a PHX norm unless you are a sports bar.  We are really excited about new addition to PHX.  Keep it up, Lou's!
