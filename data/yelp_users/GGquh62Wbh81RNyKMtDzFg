We stopped in here with friends who are professional photographers that were looking for a lightweight camera to take with them while they backpacked the Grand Canyon. The person who helped us was incredibly knowledgable (without coming across as arrogant) and helped them select a great mirrorless camera. They also had a TON of equipment for professional and amateur photographers. Great shop!

I finally stopped by Baker Nursery today after living near it for years. I have been missing out! Gorgeous 10 acres of beautiful plants. I purchased a pre-potted box of lettuce greens and also purchased a box for herbs that I got there. I spoke with Carolyn who was very knowledgable and helped me pick out the best herbs to go together in my box, how many to use, when and how much to water them, and even how to arrange them. It was a fantastic experience and I can't wait to go back!

I've had one okay experience at Thai Lahna and one pretty bad experience.   The first trip, my friend and I received our food promptly and it was good. I had the pad kee mow and it was tasty and the serving size was large enough to have a take home box. The service was nothing to write home about but it wasnt awful.   The second time I came with my husband, the service was deplorable. It took us 20 minutes just to get a glass of water and an acknowledgement of our presence. My husband ordered pad see eew (I'm so sorry I don't know the correct spelling, I'm just going phonetically here) and the waitress told him that they didn't have it. It's a pretty common thai dish so he asked for it by a different name, like drunken noodles, and she said she didn't know it again and only knew "the number" - common for restaurants with hard to pronounce dishes. She said she didn't know the names of the dishes, she just wrote down the numbers. She was really short with us and basically belted that if it wasnt on the menu they didn't have it.   She then asked her colleague to come over to our table to again point out that they don't have the dish, and began speaking over our table to each other in Spanish.   She then left for 10 minutes when someone from the kitchen staff came out. My husband asked again for the dish he desired and the staff member knew it immediately and put in the order.   I can understand a fresh server and someone who isn't as familiar with the menu, but to be put on the floor with zero training and to be so rude to a customer really blows my mind.

We were boarding one of our puppies and found out that we needed to update his vaccines before boarding him. Our regular vet couldn't get us in for two weeks, and we were leaving in two days. Enter Blue Cross. A quick call and they were able to get me in the next morning, I was elated.   They were wonderful with my mildly spastic, goofy hound dog, got me in a room quickly, and I didn't have to wait long to see a tech or the vet. They were both gentle, understanding, and very kind with him (for being such a spaz, he basically freezes when he gets his temperature taken). When I asked the vet about some behavioral issues, she was really reassuring and gave me tips on how to handle it, as well as some references for obedience trainers if we were interested in the future. Got the bordatella shot, paid, and was on my way.  Here's where it gets interesting. I called to book the boarding, and they said, "oh, did you get the bordatella and the parvo?" Oh, shooty. didn't get the parvo. So  I called Blue Cross again - they said to come right back and squeezed him in to get the second vaccine right then! Awesome service, so helpful, so kind, so good.  The facilities are well maintained and clean, they have a separate side just for cats, their staff is super helpful, overall it was an outstanding experience.

I just have to share an update from our most recent visit here with Dr. Bennett. I came in because my dog destroyed three crates in a week, and was dealing with some really intense separation anxiety. My dog was so nervous that I was sitting on the floor with him and he jumped up on the bench when she came in, and he was shaking.   Dr. Bennett came in and saw how anxious my dog was - she sat down on the floor with me and my dog came down from the bench and finally approached her with my help. We sat on the floor for a good 30 minutes discussing his behavior and his demeanor, and she was so understanding and kind and compassionate. We ended up putting him on a few medications to help him calm down and get to a better mental state, and she recommended several animal behavioral psychologists for us to take him to.   I was honestly really nervous to take my dog to the vet to talk about his behavior and anxiety, but she immediately eased those feelings and really was compassionate and kind. I would recommend her to everyone.

They have a great selection of cruisers and road bikes to check out in the shop, along with all of the gear you could ask for. I think the shop is more geared towards serious cyclers who want to go fast - way more racing and cycling gear than fixie/cruiser stuff. We ended up getting a big purchase - a new water bottle holder for my husbands bike. Ha! But, they were incredibly helpful and great to visit with, very positive associates and overall a good trip.

I really enjoy Thai food and after two weird carry out orders from here I'm calling it quits on malees. I really like Thai noodles and have gotten drunken noodles many places, but malees is the only one that uses overcooked, gummy, skinny egg noodles with hardly any sauce and raw chopped tomatoes (and no other vegetables, unless you count limp bean sprouts). I will suck it up and deal with the bad service at the place around the corner before coming back.

I received an email from RA with a $20 coupon to use for my half birthday today, so we made our way to the old town location for happy hour this evening. If you haven't already, join their mailing list. They send amazing deals all year long and while the coupon can't be combined with the food on the happy hour menu, it can be combined with the drinks and our server was very willing and able to help us use the coupon to it's best benefit (which says a lot to me).  I ordered a lemon drop and it was super good. My husband ordered an old fashioned and it was pretty good, not the best, but what can I expect from a sushi bar. Our service was wonderful at the sushi bar and we enjoyed talking with the guy behind the bar. We ordered the shrimp tempura roll, the yellow monkey roll, and the viva Las Vegas roll. Hands down, the Vegas roll stole the show - it had great sweet, spicy and salty elements to create a delectable bite. We'll certainly be back!

I like to grab carryout from this location because they have a separate desk for it and they make my life easier. I also like that I can order online and pick up my meal in five minutes. The big bowls and super large meat portions aren't what I'm in for though, I typically get an order of the lettuce wraps and the hot and sour soup (very good). It's nothing ultra traditional Chinese, but it's cheaper than PF Changs and the same quality in a convenient location. Plus, fortune cookies.

You're bound to have a great experience once you step foot into the deep woody tones inside of the village tavern. The food is fantastic, rich and well portioned. Their chef, Paul, even comes to Gainey village to do cooking classes. It's a great place to come and celebrate - don't miss it!

I've had fun here with friends out on the patio and enjoyed margaritas and chips and dip. But for a meal? No thank you. It's nothing worth writing home about - greasy, unseasoned "Mexican" food without a lot of jazz.

I don't think I've had a dish from pita jungle that I didn't like. I started with a simple gyro and really love the simple flavors that come together to make a delicious pita. I've even ventured over to their salads and specials and really like their micro plate - everything I need, everything delicious all on one plate. This location has a very convenient to go window that makes it ideal to call and pick up an order for lunch.

I really like Shadys for its divey, den-like vibes. I love its low lighting, I love its wood paneling, I love its weird B movies always playing on the tv.   But what I really, really love about Shadys is their Old Fashioned. In my book, it is hands down the best old fashioned in all of Phoenix. Big ice cube, perfect mix of bourbon and bitters, and a nice orange peel to set it off. It's just so dang good.   They have a nice pool table that's always rocking and big cozy booths around it, plus a little more seating by the bar. I wish they would update the low couches because it's like trying to sit in and stand up from a deep dish pizza, but I digress. Shadys is a great local bar with really good drinks. Give it a try!

I don't really like to give a negative review after just one experience, I usually chalk that up to an off day or bad luck. But after two bad experiences in one week, well, here we are. I like the food at autmn court and have had a few good experiences with both take out and dine in but the service here has slipped exponentially.   The first order we placed this week was over the phone to pick up, but the person on the phone took our address and our card information, and hung up quickly - we weren't sure if they were coming to deliver it or if we were still picking it up. After 25 minutes and no food, we drove to autmn court (literally, a half a mile from our house) to see if our food was there. It wasn't - turns out the driver was on their way. We waited fifteen minutes and the deliverer still hasn't arrived, so we called just to make sure there wasn't a miscommunication. Shortly after, we got a call from the driver, who was lost. My husband navigated her to our house and we finally got our food.   The second order we placed was placed in person, we left to grab a few items from the grocery and came back about 20 minutes later (they told us it would be 15 minutes so I figured we'd be all good). We waited another 10 minutes before our food was ready and took it home. Well, silly me didn't check my food to make sure it was correct before we left, and turns out, it wasn't. I promptly turned around and went back to fix the order.   I told the bartender I had the wrong order. He said, "oh! Your food is over there." Oh, thank you. I grabbed my bag and checked it. I had to ask if there had been a change in management, or if they had been having issues lately, and the only thing he said was that they had new people on the phones (my order was placed in person), but that he "had been there for twelve years." Oh, good for you, friend. He didn't offer to rectify the issue or apologize.   Then I got home and my order was still wrong. Soup has a funny way of looking the same in dark lighting.   I think they probably still have good dine in service, and the patrons at the bar looked happy, but I won't be ordering out from here again.

I love LGO for breakfast, lunch and dinner! The commuter breakfast sandwich is delicious and is usually served with a few fresh slices of fruit for breakfast. The smoked salmon salad is perfect to grab on your way out for a quick to-go lunch full of protein-rich sustenance and a perfect dressing. And for dinner? Oh man, the pizza. I love the avocado pizza, and adding the prosciutto is an absolute must. The creamy avocado with the salty prosciutto and little hint of lemon with the cheese and crispy crust is just to die for. I love it. The appetizers are perfect too - especially the dip trio (the cheese dip!) and the wings.   Skip over to the bar for a happy hour cocktail, grab a gift for a friend in the shop, make a cheese plate and grab some wine in the grocery, grab some dessert to enjoy at home (don't skip the gelato - or the pudding, or the red velvet cake...) - this place is wonderful. Always.

So last night we stopped in wildflower to place an order for two dozen assorted bagels and a few spreads for the next morning. They helped us pick out the bagels to get and were very accommodating.   Flash forward to this morning, we were in a hurry and the manager had no record of our order. I was a little miffed, and it could have turned into a bad experience. Instead, the manager gave my husband and myself free drinks, got our order together in five minutes, gave us a (delicious!) free scone and we were on our merry way. A mistake turned into a positive experience. Woohoo!

The phoenix public market is ranked as one of the top ten farmers markets in the country, and with good reason. You can literally get anything here. Amazing locally grown vegetables? Check. Grass-fed meats from local farmers? Check. Cactus? Check. Artisanal bread? Check. Oils, soaps, spreads, cheese, jewelry, gelato, food trucks and more? Check. The heart of downtown phoenix is pumping when the farmers market is in town.

I brought my parents here from out of town after they saw it on diners, drive ins and dives - they were not disappointed. We enjoyed the crispy fingerling potatoes with the white sauce especially. My meatballs were gigantic, three is more than enough. My husband had the burger and enjoyed the toppings and the spread, my mom enjoyed the salmon and my dad went for the special roasted chicken - our table fell silent when the food arrived, always a good sign of a great meal.

My friend gave me a gift certificate for a massage with Audrey. I had heard wonderful things from her and have enjoyed massages before so I was looking forward to it, especially after surgery two months ago.   To make a long story short, Audrey is an incredible massage therapist. We discussed some of my main concerns and she knew exactly where to place her hands without me having to say a word. Not to wax poetic, but I would call her a healer.   I have had a long-standing (like three years) point pain in my left abdomen and have been to many doctors and even a pain clinic and none of them could figure it out. Within 20 minutes Audrey was able to diagnose the cause of the pain and massaged and stretched me to help relieve it. She gave me some stretches to do at home as well and I am truly amazed by the decrease in pain in just 60 minutes.   My first visit to ilumina was truly life changing, and I can't wait to go back next week!

Update 9/6:  I have now seen Catherine for about two months for acupuncture and it has made such a significant change in my pain level. She is intuitive and kind and extremely knowledgable. I would encourage anyone to come here, they truly are a special team.

This is my favorite antique store on 7th ave for a more shabby chic feel but without being too overdone. The owners of this shop do a great job of curating a store that has a little practical and a little whimsy around each corner. I really like their work benches that they have for sale outside. Lots of great dressers, sideboards, dining tables, old signage letters, some metal work and more - definitely worth stopping in on a weekend antiquing jaunt!

Heck yeah, Parlor! We sat out on the patio this weekend and had a nice quick meal before heading to our next venue. We made it in time for happy hour and ordered two 8" pizzas, the summer corn and the salsiccia, and split them between the two of us. Delicious! Great crust, thin and crisp but chewy. I really enjoyed the summer corn pizza, the spicy crema and the cilantro really made it stand out for me. My husband also had their basil gimlet and I sneaked a sip - very well balanced, not too bitter or too sweet, just right. And, for it being July in Phoenix, sitting outside on their shaded patio with misters was pretty comfortable! The staff was great, well educated on their menu and our food came out quickly. Happy to add it to my list of favorite pizzas in the valley!

Lo-Lo's is the standard for chicken and waffles in my book - it sets the benchmark for all other chicken and waffles. Today was my first visit ever to the establishment, and I was not disappointed.   This is southern-style food full of love and lard, just the way it should be. I ordered the number eight, Betty's Boob (seriously) with a side of cheesy grits. The chicken was crispy and juicy, the waffle was great and not too sweet. My suggestion is to put some syrup on the waffle, get a piece of chicken and put a little hot sauce on top of it - the combination will blow you away. Sweet, salty, crispy and a little spicy, it is simply magical, no other way to put it.   The grits were pretty fantastic too. I'm a southern girl and whenever I can find grits like this, I have to tell someone about it. Their grits game is on point. All of the other sides looked awesome too - next time I'm coming for the fried okra.   Five stars for fantastic service and church music playing on Mother's Day. You go, Lo-Lo's!

I've been coming to Dylan's to see Erin Kelly for a few months now, and it's the best decision I've ever made for my hair. When I sat down she consulted with me and listened to my ideas, looked at photos and asked me about my hair routine to give me the right cut and color for my morning routine. Long story short, she's the best colorist I've ever been to - the color matched my skin tone well and was a perfect ombré. The cut was great and easy to style. When I walked out of there, I felt like a million bucks. It is a great plus that she is funny and easy to talk to. I'd highly recommend her!

We had an amazing evening at the MIM this weekend when we went to go see Seryn in the concert hall! The hall is gorgeous, lots of wood and natural tones, and carries sound just perfectly. They had beverages available for sale as well as water for free. The sound in the room... I can't get over it. It's the perfect place to see a concert. They played their last song acoustic - no mics, no nothing - and you could hear them crystal clear. Now I can't wait to go back to see the whole museum! If they put that much thought and care into their concert space, I can only imagine how great the museum is. 10/10!

I love coming here on Saturday mornings to start off my weekend on the right foot! They have wonderful, made-in-house pastries (many of which are gluten/dairy free) and really good coffee made by knowledgable baristas. I've enjoyed everything from a basic honey latte to an earl grey steamer here (with lavender syrup?!), every single drink has been great. They support local coffee roasters like Press and Cartel and primarily brew their beans. Local art hanging on the walls, free wifi, nice people.

Pretty delicious ramen in Tempe. I had the pork ramen with extra noodles and an egg. The broth was tasty and I added a little sriracha and soy sauce to kick it up a notch. The serving was gigantic and hot (with enough to bring home), I just wish the pork was a little different. It was pretty fatty and the big slices were hard to consume with chopsticks and a spoon.

Every single visit I've had to Windsor has been positive. Whether I'm sitting out on the patio under low lights next to a heater, or inside a cozy booth by their spacious bar inside, it is always a wonderful atmosphere to enjoy with friends or on a date.  Enough about the atmosphere, though - the food. I haven't met a dish here that I don't like. They have great salads (my favorite is the ahi tuna salad) that leave you satisfied. The sandwiches are the star here, though. I have enjoyed everything from the Backyard Burger to the Bahn Mi, and they are all spectacular. Great medium cook on the burger, tangy sauces (even a good kick on the bahn mi), amazing pork belly in the porkwitch... it's just so good. My favorite so far though has been the Oyster Po Boy. Giant pieces of lightly fried oysters and a huge helping of slaw to top it in the perfect roll.   The sides continue to rock my socks. Most people will rave about their mac and cheese, and it certainly deserves its accolades, but my favorite is the fried okra. The cornmeal breading stays on it perfectly and the dipping sauce they serve with it is perfection.   "But Libby!" You exclaim. "Whatever shall I drink with these delicious dishes?" Oh, let me tell you, friend. Do not miss the liquor at Windsor. The Number 63, with burbon, fresh grapefruit and honey syrup is the bomb.com. Not too sweet, not too bitter, not too liquory, just right. My other favorite is the Number 9 with rye, pineapple and mint. They're all worth a go (I just lean towards darker liquors) - definitely give it a shot. (see what I did there?)  Overall, this is one of my favorite places in the valley. Upward Projects knew what they were doing when they created this amazing place for everyone (next to an ice cream store, no less) - it's a must in my book!

Every donut I've had from bosa is absolutely delicious, but my favorite is the old fashioned sour cream donut. So perfectly crisp, sweet and savory and gone too fast. The fact that they are pure enablers open 24/7 just means that I can get a donut and boba tea on my way home, no matter the hour. Hooray!

Guys. This is great vegetarian food. I am not a vegetarian, and I loved every bite of my Asian noodle bowl with tofu. My husband got the big wac, I took a bite and it was delicious. Basically it's good vegetarian food and if you have friends that are on a pretty restricted diet (like mine are), this is a fun place to take them because they don't have to scour a menu for the only salad in town - they can eat it all. Plus the ice machine had iced T on it. What could be better?  Next time we plan on checking out Nami for their awesome soy dessert. Woo!

I am so glad we found a place that I feel safe and secure leaving my dogs while we're out of town! We've used their daycare and overnight services at least ten times now for our five year old lab and two year old hound, and it's been a breeze each time. Our dogs come home happy and tired, and I love seeing the videos that they share on their Facebook page showing me how much fun my dogs really had.   We've had them groomed there once after a stay and they were fresh and clean with nails trimmed. They are also pretty stringent on vaccines, so I don't worry about my dogs picking anything up while they're there. The employees are kind, personal and big animal lovers - I don't have to pay extra for someone to play with my dog here, they're in there all the time. I also like their amazing flexibility - I can drop off and pick up whenever is convenient for me, whether it's 9 am or 11 pm, the 24/7 service is fantastic.   If you're looking for a deal, check the Amazon Local deals. The current one is buy a night of boarding and get a night free. The amazon local deals allow existing customers to use them, which has been an issue with groupons and similar deals.

I love OHSO for it's laid back atmosphere and amazing patio. It's close enough for me that we can bike there, and they have plenty of bike racks plus tools to help with small bike repairs, and even locks. Their patio is also very dog friendly, complete with water bowls and dog treats made from the spent grain from brewing some amazing beer.   Their beer list always features their beers along with other local beers that are rotating on tap - I've always found something to enjoy to drink (even for brunch - how about a cold brew coffee beer?).   I enjoy their food but I've been so much that I kind of wish they would update their menu with a few new items. My favorite stand-bys are the veggie burger and the fish tacos. You can also substitute any of their regular burgers with the veggie burger or the turkey burger, and they are both delicious. Their fries are good, their brunch is good, their BBQ is good, basically everything is good.

We had a great experience at Distrito for our anniversary last night! The ambiance is nice and cozy and I loved having the back window wall open to the courtyard of The Saguaro Hotel. We decided the best way to go about our meal was to try several small plates so we could try lots of new things and get a good feel for the restaurant.   When I looked at yelp reviews I knew we had to get two things - the guacamole and the tuna ceviche. They both delivered - the guacamole is fresh and lightly acidic, we added the fresh crab and it takes it to another level. Straight up, it was delicious.   I now understand why someone would write an ode to the tuna ceviche - the dish, to put it lightly, is perfect. The yellowfin tuna, tender. The Serrano coconut sauce, spicy. The lime sorbet, unassuming and cooling. The sauce is just out of this world guys. You really must try it. Our waiter said they play around with the menu a lot and things come and go, but the ceviche de atun never moves.   We also enjoyed the pulpo al carbon. We had tried octopus one other time at a tapas place in ohio and liked it but found it a little tough. Not so here. The way the octopus is marinaded and grilled, which brings out a light nutty flavor to the tender meat. It's dense and delicious, and the potato confit with the bearnaise sauce brings a decadent touch.   We finished with the queso fundido - I'm glad our waiter brought this out last because it was pretty dang rich. I mean it's a crock of melted mixed cheese with barbecued duck and poblano chiles. You can do the math - it's delicious, but so heavy that you wouldn't want to start a meal with it.   All in all, we really enjoyed our time at Distrito. We had two house margaritas that were on point as well. We'll definitely be back, and I'll probably bring my parents when they venture out west.

I really enjoy shine coffee both for their coffee and their environment. Their coffee is always inventive but well-thought and delicious whether it's a simple pourover or a fancier iced drink (rose-infused coffee? What?). Their indoor space beside the tiny coffee window is to-die-for. It's a fairly quiet environment during the day, so I wouldn't say bring a big chatty group, but it is absolutely perfect for getting shit done. Lots of natural light, big tables and multiple work settings make it really ideal for anyone who doesn't work in an office.

Brat Haus continues to be one of my favorite go-to's in the Old Town Scottsdale area. Their serious love for all meats encased and ridiculous love for mustard (and German beer) is enough to keep this place on my list to take visitors and friends alike.   The brats are delicious. Any choice is a sure winner, but my favorite is the spicy wurst with root beer onions on top - a great combo of a little savory/spicy/sweet that is so good. If it's your first time Id suggest the brat and beer flight, where you get to sample three different kinds of brats plus three five ounce beer tasters. It's kind of awesome.   Their pretzels are perfect. I think right now they have a yelp deal where if you check in you get a pretzel with a side of Nutella. They're just so good and crunchy and soft.   Also the fries - get them. And get the hush hush sauce (or the chipotle aioli, or the Sriracha aioli...), you won't regret it!  Did I mention the patio? Guys. The patio. The outdoor space is giant, with lots of options from big long picnic style tables to small two-tops, peppered with trees, heaters and misters that make it the perfect phoenix patio. They're ready for you whether you have a group of two or twenty - definitely check it out!

Dlish didn't really live up to my expectations when I decided to stop in today for lunch. The menu was pretty disjointed (gyro? Thanksgiving wrap? Buffalo chicken?) but I chalked it up to variety, and tried the thanksgiving wrap while my husband had the dlish special (steak and such) and we got some salt and pepper fries to split. The server taking our order was very quiet, and was not very professional in his dress or demeanor.   The fries were pretty good, they served them with ranch dressing. Pretty standard fried sticks of potatoes. Not a lot of salt of pepper for calling them that.  I decided on the thanksgiving wrap because I like a certain local sandwich shop's thanksgiving Sammy - this was not that. I almost wish it was served cold - it was pretty mushy and lacked seasoning to me. My husband said his was just okay (I didn't taste it though).   Maybe we ordered the wrong things, or it was a bad day, but I still don't get the mustache thing.

Honestly, these are the best little coffee huts on the planet. I stopped in on a whim and was met at my car by a super sweet teen with a lovely disposition and a helpful attitude. Don't know what you want? They'll help you pick something. Don't know about the secret menu? Ooh girl, you're about to be surprised. After my first visit, I was hooked. Nothing else can compare to these friendly free-spirited baristas dishing out delicious coffees.  I've tried hot coffees, iced coffees, blended teas, and a blended annihilator this morning that was pure bliss. It's by no means a coffee purist's cup of joe, but if you're looking for a really good experience with a really great drink at the end, this is the place to go.   Also! Their granola bars and muffin tops are on point!

I don't quite know how to describe our visit to Saigon Pho. My husband and I couldn't decide what to do for dinner so we crawled through some yelp and groupon deals and decided on pho. We like pho. So off to Tempe we went.   We were greeted by green walls, a turtle pond, and the owner who directed us to our booth. "We have Vietnamese food here," she said. Yes, I know. I came here for your Vietnamese food. We ordered Thai iced teas and were prepared to order our meals, but after we ordered our drinks she left her notepad on our table and left. Oh, okay.   A waiter (her son) came to our table to deliver the Thai iced teas, which were good, and to take our order. I ordered the chicken pho and my husband ordered the beef pho. We also got the crab Rangoon.   He came back with our crab Rangoon... And also a British accent. What? Yes. He had completely changed his accent from perfectly American to straight up Brit. The couple in the lobby putting in a to go order noticed it as well. "Where are you originally from?" They asked. "Colorado Springs." He said. Oh...  Back to the food. The crab rangoons came out. They were pretty good. A little sweet for my taste. The sauce was really runny though, like it was watered down. He also brought our side plates of fun things to put in our pho, including bean sprouts, mint sprigs and jalapeños. And lemons.   Our pho came out. Mine had what looked like shredded chicken from a rotisserie chicken in it, my husbands had grey beef and tripe in it (though no tripe was ordered).We had both asked for a level 3 heat in our soups, but neither were spicy, or very flavorful. This is when I reached for the condiment tray, to add some sriracha and chili paste. It seemed that none of the bottles had ever been wiped down - they were grimy and sticky to the touch. I went to pour a little soy sauce into the broth - IT WOULDN'T POUR OUT OF THE BOTTLE. But, I digress.   We mentioned we had a living social deal to pay. It seems that they have used several of these services to drum up business, as the table next to us had one as well. They were not excited about us using the living social deal that they had decided to sign up for in the first place. Begrudgingly, without speaking, the owner took our check and hand-wrote the new total. We put our credit card in the book. The waiter came back and asked us if we wanted more water or to-go boxes. We said no thank you. He left without taking the check. We waited five minutes for him to come back to ask if we wanted water again so we could pay and leave.   We left with our stomachs feeling full but uncomfortable. I looked longingly across the parking lot at Ted's, certain that a corn dog would have been more satisfying than this disaster.

Just had a delicious meal here with another couple and we all had a great time. I enjoyed the 75 cocktail and my husband had old chub (on nitro, not typical for a restaurant) and they were both great.   While the bacon appetizer looked tempting, I don't think I could have stomached five types of bacon plus more meat as an entree so we opted out of it, but it looked amazing at the table next to us. I had the St. Louis style ribs and my husband had the brisket. The smoke ring on the ribs was perfectly pink and smothered in a sticky sweet and spicy barbecue sauce. It was really delicious, my only wish was that it was warmer. It came with a tortilla and I had forgotten to ask for the biscuit instead but the tortilla was super good. It came with a side of cole slaw that I enjoyed - not too creamy, a little bit more vinegary, and really let the flavors melt together. I also got a side of the smashed potatoes and they were insane. My friend got them as well and as we both took a bite, we knew shit just got real. The icing on the cake? About half way through our meal our waiter came up to our table with an extra drink the bar had made (the blueberry one) and gave it to us. Woohoo!   The atmosphere of the restaurant is really great, a cool rustic meets 50s style with just the right pops of color in the right place. If you're looking for a cool place to grab dinner in old town and you like smoky meats and western style with a little hipster flair, bootleggers is a great place to eat!

Our experience at taco guild was great! Our server Latim (I hope I spelled that right) was knowledgable and well trained. Our chips came out fresh and hot and the salsa to go with it was delicious. I ordered the margarita - one of the best I've ever had, you won't be disappointed. But the highlight of the night was the duck taco - get it. Everyone at our table loved it!

Just enjoyed a pretty lovely dinner at the bar. We walked up and the wait for a table was 50 minutes, but the bar is first come first serve and we magically found two seats next to each other at 7:30 on a Saturday night. Kismet.   The bar is big and comfortable, a wrap-around that's probably big enough for 30 people. My only complaint is there wasn't a place for my purse, I would love a hook for it underneath the bar. Our server was attentive and we got a smaller pitcher (about 2.5 beers) of good beer for $7, which I thought was a pretty stellar deal.  The complimentary chips and salsa came out hot and spicy. The salsa was good to me, I love cilantro and smoky heat and it delivered. I ordered three tacos, the standard, carnitas and tuna, and also got the refried beans. It was all delicious, from the tortilla to the toppings! My favorite was honestly the standard - it was the quintessential street taco. Delicious marinated chicken with smooth avocado and a great pico on top.   I'd definitely recommend it, and we'll for sure be back!

We love whole foods for their hot salad bar, awesome prepared food choices and killer cheese/meat selection. But 20 Highland Tavern is the highlight of this place - tons of awesome beer on tap and great food. Don't miss out on their specials or their tots. TOTS.

We love to fill up our growlers here - and they always have killer deals. On Thursdays their growler refills are $4 off! They let you sample as many beers as you'd like and are always super knowledgable and friendly.   Little tip - it is cheaper to order sushi from their menu than it is to pick it up pre-made at the sushi bar in the grocery. All of the food is made expeditiously from the wonderful chefs around whole foods - definitely worth stopping here for a bite and a beer to start a night out.

I've been to Pomo for several company outings and for dinner dates. The quality of service and food never wavers whether I'm there with two people or twenty - it is always an excellent visit with knowledgable waiters and delicious pizzas. Any of the pizzas they offer on the menu are absolutely delicious as well, I wouldn't hesitate trying a new option here at all. Definitely worth a visit, don't miss the patio in cooler weather!

I have visited both the Tempe and old town locations and I really enjoy both for their unique vibes, but the old town location is a little more open and has a great patio to enjoy. I have tried several of the pasties but my favorites are the more traditional ones, especially the chicken pot pie pasty - just a perfect, flaky crust and rich, saucy fillings that warm you to the core.   Speaking of warming you to the core, get yourself a cup of the leek soup - it's so underrated and you won't even believe it. Spread some butter on the house made bread, dip it in the soup and you've got yourself a little piece of heaven.   Always great British beers and ales on tap too - one of my favorite restaurants to bring visitors to in the valley.

I just really like ingos. They have strong burgers made with killer ingredients, great sides and good beer, wine and sangria. We live pretty close and have been to LGO billions of times, but have started to frequent ingos for it's lower-key environment and simplicity. My favorite side to get is the potato crisps with that amazing dip - definitely worth adding to your meal. If you're not into beef, my favorite is the tuna burger. It's nice and spicy but not overwhelming, and the tuna doesn't get lost in the sauce. The blush sangria is on point, too!

I really enjoyed our first visit to jewels for a late brunch today! Our waiter was friendly and helpful. I had the spud plate and my husband had the biscuits and gravy with chorizo. On my first bite, I literally swore out loud. It was that good.

Had a great time at this Asian fusion restaurant in cenpho with friends last night! The patio was perfect for a March evening, and wasn't loud like I thought it would be for being on a busy street. We all started with cocktails and I ordered the sloe burn (I love bourbon/whiskey) - it was really good. Very complex flavors and a little spice at the end. I'd recommend it if you're a fan of anything in the whiskey category.  We each ordered a steamed bun and I had the Peking duck - the bun is a little more taco-esque than your typical steam bun, but the meat was tender and the sauce that came with it is awesome. My husband had the catfish and it was my favorite. The pineapple tartar sauce on it is awesome.   We all ended up getting noodles for our main dishes. I got the pork ramen. I am a novice ramen connoisseur but do enjoy a good bowl of ramen - it was very good. The kicker is that it's topped with the sexiest slow poached egg I've ever seen in my life, just oozy and silky perfect with the broth and the pork. The kale in the ramen didn't really work for me, it had an acidic taste to it that I wasn't in to, but the noodles were cooked well and the pork/bacon was delicious. The broth was nice, not super heavy. I tried the curry that my husband got and it was awesome - great spicy flavor with coconut and peppers. Those udon noodles were on point.   All in all, we had a good time. I would go back for happy hour, they have good drink specials and appetizers!

We decided to go for Giant Rustic Pizza shortly after it came to the Arcadia neighborhood on a night when cooking just wasn't going to happen. We found a deal for a three topping pizza and called our order in to pick up. The person who took our order was knowledgable and helpful. We also ordered the spinach artichoke dip on her suggestion.   The spinach artichoke dip was nice, creamy and garlic-y and was served with thin slices of toasted French bread. Loved it.  Pick up was a breeze and we enjoyed our still-hot pizza when we got home. I don't know if anyone else feels this way, but I feel like tarragon and oregano MAKE a pizza. Let me tell you, they were on point with their herbs, y'all. Good crust, just enough sauce. The toppings are pretty standard pepperoni and sausage (the sausage is sliced instead of crumbled) but still good. I'm not sure id put it above all others, but it's pretty good!

We've been long-time fans of brat haus and decided to give the new taco haus a try today for lunch. Not super packed for a Friday and easily found a nice seat on the patio. The ambiance is nice (and who doesn't like sitting outside in February). We had two servers come up to us and I think there was some confusion, but no harm done in making sure we were all set.   My husband and I ordered the chips and salsa as a small appetizer and both felt it could have come with more chips (small cereal bowl size) for the amount of salsa verde we received (two cups). The salsa was pretty sour to both of us and not spicy.   We both ordered a couple of street tacos for lunch. I don't think I could say I had one that was a favorite, or very memorable. The shrimp was ok, the pork belly was bland, the carne asada was probably the best out of them but nothing to write home about.   I would say that taco haus doesn't quite compete when compared to other local taco establishments. It was a good spot close to work and I might stop in for a Taco Tuesday happy hour (for the deals alone), but I won't seek it out again any time soon.

First, I have to say that I'm really mad that I moved around the corner from here three months ago, go to rollover donuts regularly, and still didn't go to oven + vine until tonight. I'm just so mad that good food has been this close to me and I didn't know it. Ok. On to the review of this fantastic spot.   We brought my parents who were visiting from out of town to check out a local spot. The ambience is casual and laid back without trying to feel too hip or snooty - it feels like it's a part of the neighborhood. We grabbed a spot at the middle table and our waiter Austin came to grab our drink and appetizer orders. We ordered the roasted mushrooms and buffaletta. The mushrooms were roasted in garlic oil and topped with shaved Parmesan, served with the best bread I've ever had at a restaurant. They came out piping hot and they were fantastic! The buffaletta was creamy and drizzled with olive oil and balsamic vinegar - it's my favorite cheese, and they did it justice.   My husband and I each got a flatbread. I got the Margherita and added prosciutto. Their marinara sauce is divine. The crust, better than anything else that tries to call itself a "flatbread." Bubbly, crispy, chewy perfection topped with fresh mozzarella and basil. My husband got the Earl and while I didn't try it, he certainly loved it.   My parents both got the green chile chicken. I have to say this - my mom is really picky. She is an amazing cook and doesn't like to go out to eat much and doesn't want to waste her time or money on something she could make at home. My mom took one bite of the green chile chicken and a huge grin came across her face. Then she started dancing in her seat. It is that good, guys. So tender and juicy and spicy and delicious. She got a side of the au gratin potatoes and they were so creamy and struck the perfect balance between savory, salty and just a hint of lactic sweetness. My dad finished his bowl and had a side of the roasted seasonal vegetables that looked awesome. Mom had enough left over that she's going to put it on toast with a sunny side up egg tomorrow morning (I can't wait).   We capped the night off with the chocolate torte and a scoop of gelato to split between the four of us. The torte was so perfectly dense and rich, and the tartness of the raspberry compote that came on the plate paired with the torte so well.   I have no complaints. Fantastic atmosphere, great service and delicious food. I can't wait to bring my friends the next time for drinks, appetizers and that amazing torte!

I had a blast at Glow Putt last night with my husband on a date night! For $20, we played 18 fun holes of putt putt under black lights (and got glow in the dark bracelets!). While the space itself is relatively small, they still managed to pack an easy-to-navigate 18 hole course with a good mix of levels of difficulty. They have little benches with black lights in them to recharge your glow in the dark ball that were pretty convenient. And, if you get a hole in one on the last hole, you get a card for a free round on your next visit (and I did!). I could see us coming back here when it's 115 degrees outside and need a fun place to beat the heat.

We checked out Union Barrel House last Friday for a bite before we went to the movies. For being in Old Town, it was pretty low-key, and the atmosphere was great with good music, lots of exposed beams, reclaimed wood, a big fireplace and a big patio that was a little bit quieter than inside. We grabbed a table outside (because it's finally cool enough, woohoo!) and our waiter promptly came to take our drink orders. I had the Aggressive Squirrel, with Bulleit bourbon, luxardo, orange and nut brown ale - it was so delicious, like an old fashioned that had a nice nutty ale added to it. They had nearly 40 beers on tap, all great (I don't think you'll find Coors here) and all $2 off during Happy Hour, which goes from three - seven.  We waited a bit for the waiter to come back to take our food order, and we decided to split the Liberty Fondue and the Pear, Brie and Jam melt, with the Parmesan truffle fries. The fondue and pretzel rolls came out piping hot, and the cheese blend they use is out of this world. The order only comes with three pretzel rolls and an ample amount of cheese, so I might ask for extra rolls next time, or keep the cheese and enjoy it with the fries. Maybe I did that, I don't know. I think the parm truffle fries need their own special sauce - just straight up ketchup kind of kills them.  The melt was pretty good, the cheese was gooey and you can't go wrong with brie, but the bacon jam and the pear could have used a little something salty to compliment the flavors of the sandwich. Overall, we enjoyed our visit, and I think we'll be coming back (they currently have a groupon) to try some of the other dishes with my favorite fall beers. This place is like if the little woody and postino had a baby, and it's darn delicious  - definitely give it a shot!

Have you ever been rendered speechless by a piece of chicken? If your answer is no, you've been eating the wrong chicken, and you need to get yourself to Chicken + Donuts.   We came on a Saturday for lunch and each enjoyed a combo of the two piece chicken and a donut, plus a side. We both got Korean chili chicken, I got the balsamic pear donut and my husband got the chocolate pistachio rose donut. I got the cucumber salad side and my husband got the slaw.   It was ridiculous.   The chicken was perfectly crispy but surprisingly light and juicy covered in an amazing spicy sweet Korean sauce garnished with scallions, and after I had my first bite, I couldn't talk. You know when you're sitting around the table with your family and your mom made your favorite dish and somebody goes, "it must be good, the whole table went silent!"? It was like that, but in an old booth in a renovated KFC serving the best food I've eaten all year.   The donuts were exquisite. The artisan donuts that this unassuming place pumps out... I can't comprehend it. My pear balsamic donut had a great natural pear flavor with a tart/sweet thing going on that ruled. My husbands chocolate pistachio rose donut was my favorite though, for the salty/sweet plus crunch deal. It was just all so good.   tl;dr: this place is unassuming perfection with the best chicken I've ever eaten, a great outdoor space, good donuts and Stevie Wonder on the speakers. It's a must.

We had an awesome lunch at ocotillo this week! We brought my parents who were visiting from out of town - they love trying new and inventive things, and ocotillo certainly delivered.   Our server Josh gave us the run down on the menu and recommended a few of the house favorites. From the small plates, we tried the hand pulled mozzarella, roasted cauliflower and the roasted beets.   The mozzarella was served with pickled carrots and a carrot top pesto that was refreshingly tangy and the spice paired so well with the coolness of the mozzarella. The pink peppercorns on top just added the perfect extra hint of salty heat for the dish.   The roasted cauliflower was the star of the meal, I think. The flavor they packed into the cauliflower was just nuts. It was like this peanut roasted balsamic sauce with fresh pesto and chili peppers - it was so, so good.   The roasted beets were great too! There were a multitude of different ones to try all on a bed of whipped herbed ricotta that was amazing.   I got the tofu bahn mi, mom got the Japanese fish and chips, dad got the smoked salmon salad and my husband got the Peruvian chicken. Everything looked delicious and tasted even better! I loved the peanut sauce on my sandwich, moms fish was perfectly lightly fried, dads salad was refreshing, and my husbands chicken just pushed the limits on spice to be interesting and tasty. I also have to mention their lemonade - the ginger, lemongrass and mint make it so refreshing and delicious on a warm day. I always get one to go.   We sat outside on the covered patio by the bar and loved it. Such a perfect way to enjoy the Phoenix spring. Definitely stop by for brunch, lunch or dinner!   Oh - I have to give a hat tip to their coffee bar too. They're serving up sightglass beans and creating delicious drinks (and it opens super early!). Worth stopping by and getting out of the car for a cup of coffee instead of driving by the closest Starbucks. Give it a try, especially if Liden is on the bar!

Oh Phoenix, more of this, please! Centrally located, rustic interior, big bar, bigger table, lots of natural light, not too loud, and REALLY good beer! We got a flight and tried everything they had on tap. I really liked the Senor Gallo lager and the Oatmeal Stout, but they were all fantastic. They don't serve food but there was a food truck there when we visited, so we got dinner and ate at the brew house. It's a great spot for a little date, especially if you can snag the two leather recliners in the back by the fireplace.

This gem at Scottsdale & Shea is not to be missed! Great rustic interior (with a cold brew drip hanging from the ceiling!), lots of little comfy nooks to work in, a larger meeting room in the back, great lighting and smart employees. The owner makes all of the pastries and pies - holy moly. I've had a hand pie there and the almond poppy seed muffin, and they're both awesome. The tarts look incredible too.   "But Libby!" you say, "This is a coffee shop! Tell me about the coffee!" Oh friend, I will. The coffee is excellently crafted by very talented baristas. They serve (and sell) Ritual Coffee, a top notch roaster. Enjoy a chemex or a latte while you're there. Not in the mood for coffee? Their iced tea is to DIE for, especially the white tea. Definitely one to go check out!
