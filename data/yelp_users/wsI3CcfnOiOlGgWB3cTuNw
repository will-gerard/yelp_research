Just tried this place for the first time for a girls luncheon.  Really enjoyed the atmosphere and quaint surroundings.  It was packed when we arrived, but we had a reservation (highly recommend this).  We stayed well past closing, and they were very polite and did not attempt to kick us out.   Service was excellent, our waiter was patient with the 2 high protein, 1 full on vegetarian, and one new mommy. We probably had one no dieter in the whole group, so our order was complex, and the waiter just went with it.  Plus he was very entertaining. Always back to the table to top off drinks etc.   Food is large quantities for what you pay for, very fresh and delicious.  A thoroughly enjoyable outing!!!

I have been going to Champs Salon now for 10 years.  It's amazing how time flies.  Originally I started going to Champs to have my nails done (by Mandy Evans).  She came highly recommended; and is a lot of fun.  Within the year; I also started having my hair professional colored and cut (by JT; also excellent).   Now a days our whole family has some kind of service there; whether it be cuts or hair shaves for the men or color and nails for the girls. Both Mandy and JT have done so much work for us, onsite and off.  For my daugthers wedding, JT came to the hotel and did everyones hair for them.  For MY wedding; JT trained Mandy and my daughter how to style it (wedding was a in Rocky Point).  Mandy then came down and styled my hair and my flowergirls; along with generally assisting with everything.   Over the past 10 years we have gotten to know everyone at Champs.  Most of the girls here have been here for longer then this even.  They are very professional, and concientious.  They stay up to date with new processes and products.   The worse I can say is that it is sometimes hard to get a last minute appointment because Mandy and JT are so busy; but I find that it works better to schedule in advance and not spur of the moment.   All their work is excellent AND guaranteed satisfaction!

Terrible.    I remember when Scottsdale Clubs were a bit classy and at a minimum had a dress code.  We went to Suede last night for a bachelorette party. When did it become appropriate to wear baggy jeans, and side ways caps?  This club was jam packed, and seriously a fire escapae hazzard to say the least.   The highlight of the night was the boucers tossing a chick who fought with her Pimp boyfriend while he continued to swagger back into the bar.   Is this what the economy has driven us to?

For a Bar, Zuma has some excellent food. Not the typical bar menu. We try to eat at Zuma when we are in downtown Tempe or before events/concerts etc. the Management and Bar Staff are very social and friendly etc.  Love the bottomless Mimosa specials on weekends!  Have not been there for the nightlife/late night but I hear they pack em in.....

We moved to Queen Creek a year ago; and although I have lived in the East Valley my whole life, I rarely explored this area.  So we are trying local restaurants etc.  Skippy's was a nice change up.  Although "Cantina" is in their title, the menu is a combination of Mexican and Comfort food.  I originally wanted the Bisquits and Gravy; but the waitress startled me by suggesting only a 1/2 order since you get so much food.  I wasn't sure if I was more hungry for just a 1/2, so changed my order for pancakes (also a lot of food!!!).  The beer was deliciously cold, the service was great and attentive, and we loved the food.  We will definitely be making this one of our regular places to eat.

We have been going to Uncle Bears since the very first one opened in Gilbert. We use to talk to the owner (Todd) all the time even.  Not sure if he still owns the chain or not.   That said; we ate at the Mesa location (Ellsworth/Baseline) last night, and I must say, it was a bit dissapointing.  Food took longer then usual to arrive, and the fries were cold.  The Fish & Chips which I use to rate the best were more like square fish sticks (like you can buy in the frozen section).  The worse was the Herd Chopped Beef burger. It was very dry, almost no onions and literally looked like they took 1-2 hamburger patties and tore them in to pieces.  I'm hoping this is just a Chef change that can be corrected, or we won't be stopping in here very much anymore. :(  The beer was still good....and cold.

Just hang a big sign on the door saying "WE DON'T WANT YOUR BUSINESS!!!"  Attempted to make quick trip for a few items last night (about 7:30pm).  The store is apparently in the process of getting remodeled.  The lights in the parking lot were dimmed, and there were not lights on at either opening of the store.  One of the doors was even blocked with shopping baskets.  At first I thought perhaps the store wasn't even open, but I proceeded to go inside.  The whole store is in disarray due to the remodel; however, what worse part was the customer service!!  The cashiers both had the chain across their isles which forced me to have to use the self-service (which I hate because invariably something doesn't ring through).   The clerk that was supposed to be supporting self-serve kept walking away, which meant all 3 times that the scanner failed I had to wait for her to return.  The 3rd time it happened, so was standing over at a regular checkout sorting something, and I am pretty sure she knew I needed assistance.  I finally called out to one of the young men (shopping cart boy) and asked how I could get some service.  He came over to reset the scanner and proceeded to get called out for "standing around" by the woman who SHOULD have been helping me.    Very frustrating.  If you don't want business while you remodel, then close up shop!  Don't treat the few customers you have left this poorly.  Bashas is NOT competively priced at all, so it's customer loyalty more than anything that brings people in.  It's sad that now that the Eddie is gone that the business and service is quickly going to ruin....

I was really looking forward to going here as I went on recommendation.  I will say, the food was very good, tasted fresh and was very tasty.   However, sometimes the experience can spoil the meal.  There is no host to seat you so when you walk in you are just guessing as to if to seat yourself, wait for someone etc.  At this point a child (yes, I mean about a 9 year old child) tells us where to sit.   After a bit; a Chinese woman asks for our drink order.  Upon returning she takes our order although she does talk me out of the sizzling rice soup because she thinks its too big if I plan to order dinner.  She tells me that she will just put rice on top of wonton soup (which arrives too cooled to sizzle the rice).   Dinner is served with 1 paper napkin each.  Although we had ordered the "extra sides" as stated on the menu for $1.50 each; when those were delivered to the table, they were on 1 plate set in front of my hubby.  NO indication that it was for both of us.   Food itself was actually quite good.  1/2 way through dinner I received a phone call on my cell that was a bit important.  When I grabbed my phone, I accidently dropped it in my sizzling seafood platter.  This splashed my phone, hair and shirt with sauce.  The primary waitress SAW this happened, yet it took 10 minutes to get additional napkins.  I requested water and we never received.   The 9 year old is who processed my credit card for the bill.  We never were served water, asked to order additional drinks etc.   Bottom line; IF I go here again, it will be for take out order only.  Food good, service bad.

This was the first time I have ever eaten in this restaurant.  A friend brought me here and loves the place.   The Service was great.  Friendly, upbeat and fun.   The food was incredible.  I only had a hamburger but it was very fresh (and almost too much to eat).  The fresh veggies and carmelized onions on the burger were yummy.  I was only able to eat about 3 of my homemade fries due to how big the burger was.   The atmosphere was wonderful.  Cozy, yet a combination of business folks and ladies lunching etc.   All in all a great experience.  I will definate recommend in the future.

I have often passed 4 Paws Resort and finally decided to give them a try.  It was an excellent experience.  The staff was very friendly and easy to work with on setting up my account.  I toured the facility prior to booking and found it to be very clean, and efficient. Also very accomodating for my 2 high energy border collies.   The kennels have an indoor/outdoor feature where the pups can go out to potty but are inside the rest of the time.  Given they stayed over the 118 degree days; I was very happy they were inside with AC.  The Resort also has someone onsite 24 hours, which was very reassuring.   I purchased extra play time 2 times per day for both dogs.  They had one group play and one private.  The group play involved throwing balls, playing with the hose and running through a play pool.  They absolutely loved it. I also had them groomed on the pick up day (a special they were running); so the pups came home clean and happy.  They were a bit exhausted from all the activity.   There was only 2 very minor glitches and that was my paper work from my Vet had to be faxed twice, and my request for 2 play times was mis-intepreted to be only one day (versus all 5).  Fortunately I was good about following up and caught both these things upfront.   I will definately use this bording service again!

I just ate at Center Bistro today.  I must admit that I have not really tried any of the restaurants in the renovated area of Tempe (other then the big ones).  I had the special of the day which was the encrusted Salmon.  WOW!  It was cooked perfectly, and served atop brown rice.  It also came with fresh squash, which was also cooked to perfection.  The food tasted so fresh.    In addition to the Salmon we had fresh Humus and crusty bread, and delicious green tea.   The overall environment inside the restaurant seemed nouveau/tech.  Comfortable, but great for a business meeting. The staff was extremely friendly, and it had the atmosphere of a place where a lot of regulars hang out.  In fact, the owner of the building and his son both were in the restaurant, and both seemed genuinely nice.  I definately recommend it.  I am taking a friend there later this week (he is a total foodie), and will get a second opinion

Just want to send a shout out for NVP Autowerks. We recently had to take our Ford 250 Diesel in for repair.  It had a hard start when the truck was cold.  Riley (the mechanic) diagnosed the issue first thing in the morning, and to our surprise, it wasn't even the problem we expected.  It turned out to be the Fuel Control Module.  That said, we were offered 3 different options for repair (solder old part, replace with Ford Part, replace with BETTER after market part).  We chose to replace the part, and Riley had it ordered and installed within 1.5 days.  It's run like a charm ever since.   We were particularly surprised when Riley did a follow-up call just to ensure everything was running fine.  Excellent customer service!!   Our Ford is really starting to get broken in, and hence, we have more repairs ahead of us.  We will definitely be going back to NVP!
