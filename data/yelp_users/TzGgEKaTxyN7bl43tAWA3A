The pharmacy lost my moms TIME SENSITIVE prescription after it had been processed. Then the Doctor called it in again and they said they never received the call (which we now know isn't true because the manager checked the messages and they had not been checked in 4 hours) so the Doctor called again and spoke with a person finally. My mom goes to pick up the prescription and it's not the correct one after all of that. They didn't even have the right product from the beginning. Which they should have stated the first time she went to pick it up. The product they gave her worked fine however it was quite the hassle to get.

I've been to Echo a number of times and I'm never disappointed. Their lattes are delicious, the ice tea is so refreshing but the real winner is the chai tea, it is literally addicting. It's a good study spot and also a good meeting place to catch up with friends. The customer service is a great Skyler (the barista that is always there when I'm there) and I are on a first name basis. He makes it a point to have a conversation with you and be hospitable. After writing this I think I might have to get a chai because I've been thinking about it ever since I wrote about it. Dang it haha.

The last experience I had a pig and pickle was awful. We had been once before and it had been alright food but I wanted to give it another try since we live in the neighborhood and I had heard great reviews. We went for the late night service and called before I went to make sure they were still serving the waitress was hesitant to say yes even though there was over an hour of service left. I have worked in the food industry and if you're open your open you can't complain about your hours. When we got there the same lady helped us with our food. We ordered a couple drinks and asked what she recommended for food. She recommended the pork tostadas THEY WERE TERRIBLE. When she brought over the food it smelled rancid.... like she was serving us rotten meat. I ate one bite and couldn't take another. She never came back to our table to ask how her food was so I'm almost positive she did it on purpose because we didn't eat a single bite of it. I am not usually quick to judge but the behavior was unacceptable. We could never get her attention so we paid in cash and left. Terrible experience. We will never be back. So disappointed.

Oh my gosh. I will be back here next week. Maybe even tomorrow. My family of four came to eat dinner here. First impression is it is quaint and contains Kobe beef meat shop inside (yummm). We chose to sit outside because it was nice out. There is a water fixture that adds to the ambiance. Our waiter was super nice and the food came so fast. We ordered some chips with salsa and guac. Great chunks of avocado and the salsa was addicting (the green was had a nice kick to it). I ordered the combo of two tacos and a side of beans or rice. I chose the al pastor and the el pollo and a side of beans. I don't even know where to begin! The chicken taco had great flavor but the al pastor was to die for. It was perfectly cooked with complimentary toppings like pineapple that just burst with flavor. The beans were probably the best flavored refried beans I have ever had and it was a large portion! With the four of us having full meals and an appetizer we only spent 42 dollars. What a great place! I will be back very soon :)

Sandra is amazing. Not only was her food absolutely delectable but her personality is amazing. My dad hired her for my moms birthday party and everything went swimmingly. First course was pork empanadas, which were fantastic with the perfect amount of filling. She made fresh mozzarella right in front of us (which was the best cheese I have ever had) putting it with tomatoes for a caprese salad with a fantastic basil pesto/balsamic dressing. The main course was Cornish game hen with stuffing, roasted sweet potatoes, turnips, rutabaga, and au jus. It was perfectly seasoned- melt in your mouth good. The dessert was a chocolate fondue cake topped with ice cream with a wine reductions sauce. It was a perfect amount and tasted heavenly. Throughout the night her and her assistant Juan made sure out drinks stayed full and our place settings clear. Overall it was such an amazing experience. Our guests left full and so very happy. I would recommend Sandra to anyone throwing a dinner party. It was an amazing evening and my mom was thrilled!

I really enjoyed the ambiance of this place. The mason Jar Margs are yummy and the cheese crisp is perfectly cooked. I got the carne asada for my dinner.  It was delicious and not greasy at all. The meat was cooked perfectly with great seasoning. I wish it came with a little more sour cream and guac but that's ok. The rice was fluffy and the beans were really good as well. The tortilla that came with the meal was AMAZING. Overall it was a great experience. If I am ever on this side of town again I will be coming here. However, one thing that could have been better is my sister ordered a non alcoholic margarita and they still charged her 9 bucks for it.

We went shopping here for my sisters wedding dress. She had a credit from a previous dress that she didn't end up liking that she returned in the allotted amount of time. Little did she know the mess we would be getting into....   The customer service was so unprofessional. Once we told them it was a credit dress it was like we didn't exist anymore. Even though we had already paid 1200 dollars in full.   The experience was very disappointing and unfortunate that the business made no effort to allow the future bride to use the difference on the dress she picked toward her mothers dress or a bridesmaid dress. Over 350.00 was lost by my sister the business could have used toward alterations we could have used it for a honeymoon!  Very poor business practice!

I was really sad that I didn't like this place. I had heard about it recently and their taco Tuesday. I decided to take my grandparents with me when I went. First impression walking in the door was the atmosphere was very modern. Unfortunately we were awkwardly standing in the door for a good minute trying to figure out if we seat ourselves or not. Usually there is a sign or someone who immediately says something at other places I have been too. We ordered a round of the 4 dollar margaritas which were delicious! Honestly the only reason I was able to bump up the rating. The staff was pretty friendly as well. My grandpa and I got the carne asada tacos. I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to food but the carne asada tacos I got were just dry and had no flavor. The sides were just as flavorless (lentils and white rice). My grandma got the pork belly tacos. I tried them and once again overcooked with conflicting flavors. Lastly we ordered another round of margaritas that never came. I would like to say I would give taco haus another chance but I don't know what I would get knowing I tried things there were well known on the menu :(.

If you're looking for a quaint spot with great service you have found it. They recently changed management and obtained their liquors license. The owner, Louis was super hospitable and nice the whole evening. The food tasted great! It was super rich so be prepared :). They just started a happy hour and I can't wait to go for that! Overall it was an excellent experience.

I love this place! It may be small but it is mighty. It's a great starting/ending point to a night in Old Town. The beer selection/variation is awesome. They also have a wine menu but I didn't get a good look at it. The food is freaking awesome.  It's mainly munchies but there is a Croque Monsieur that is out of this world good. I'm excited to go back and try the other things on the menu that I haven't tried. The owner was also very nice!
