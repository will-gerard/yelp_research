Went on a saturday morning, the place was busy. the format was well suited for it though as it was like a fast food breakfast setup. order, pay, you get a number and your breakfast is brought to you. I'd be scared to bring a large group cause seating is tough to come by.   I had the Costa breakfast burrito which was phenomenal! Chorizo, bacon, and potato! Yum!

Dear employees of this location.  Complaining about your hours and schedule instead of making my sandwich is a quick way to get your hours cut to zero. Freaky fast.pffft. Freaky yes,  fast, no.

Total let down.  None of the charm of the one on Camelback. Not sure if the people who work here have ever even been to the original to understand what is all about.  Seems like every other Scottdale joint.  Yuppy, played out and lame.

As we pulled up the windows were boarded up as they are just opening this location recently and haven't finished the exterior fully.  After our experience they may as well leave them up with the level of competition that is right down the street!   One star only because I had to.  Stopped in for a beer and lunch, 20 minutes in and we couldn't even get a water. This after sitting AT the bar as service is usually better at the bar. Not even a water! WTF? Isn't that standard service protocol? The couple seated next to us had a similar experience based on what they were saying to there friends on the phone.
