Overrated.  Overpriced.  To much pride and ego for an inferior product.  My girlfriend and I went in looking for Oysters. High Tide had been recommended to her by her boss. I have to say for the most part we were unimpressed and found the majority of the price points to be inflated.   While neither of us are Oyster aficionados by any means, we know what we like and came here because we had a craving. We sat at the bar, which is an open style Oyster Bar.  Two guys in ratty t-shirts were working. We were a bit put off when one of the guys grabbed what was obviously our ticket, hand it to the other worker and make some sort of comment about it being "his turn." There was a groan and a roll of the eyes as he looked at the ticket. Since the next thing he did was shuck our oysters, we already felt a bit awkward as if we were putting the two guys out for doing their job.   More importantly, the oysters were tiny and fair at best. $34 for the smallest oysters I have ever seen was a bit disappointing. Again, we aren't oyster aficionados, so maybe it's a fancy type of oyster we aren't aware of.   We didn't finish our order or our drinks. We paid out our tab and had dinner elsewhere. We won't be back.

Came in for lunch. Jessy was our server. She was a lot of fun and was amazingly patient and easy going with our diversive smart Alec group. Overall we had a great experience and the food was very tastey. I'll be back for sure!
