I can't believe there are only 8 reviews on here for Seattle Espresso! The number of regular, faithful customers who frequent Seattle Espresso rivals that of any coffee shop I have ever been to either in the U.S. or internationally. It is my, and many others, home away from home.   Go, and go more than one time.  Try a double shot iced White Russian and then work yourself across the menu! All of their drinks are delicious!  The Baristas will remember you and your drink, especially if you go a couple times. My favorite aspect of Seattle Espresso is that all different types of people frequent the establishment.  It is not only made up of trendy, hipster customers, although some of them come here too!   The decor is nothing to write home about, but it is the people and the product that keep people coming back again and again.

My husband and I were looking for a quiet spot to work where nobody knew us, and decided to give Solo Cafe a try. Both times we frequented Solo, there was an overwhelming chemical smell permeating from the connecting hair salon. Even though our noses became accustomed to the smell, both times we left with lingering headaches.    My husband, being a purest, had drip coffee. He complained that it was lukewarm, and wondered what in the world the Barista was doing behind the counter for 10 minutes.  I had some yummy hot tea.    Overall, we like the quite, work friendly atmosphere. However, the overpowering chemical smell from the hair salon will prevent us from coming back any time soon.   We will stick with our favorite coffee establishment, Seattle Espresso (McClintock & Warner), where the coffee is hot and delicious and the place doesn't stink!
