Just serving delicious chat is not enough, you also need to have decent Customer Satisfaction rate . But the people working here do not understand that.   I had called the front desk to order chola puri Togo for dinner on Thursday night. The owner of this fast food joint told me that it will be ready in 20 minutes. I reached there in 30 mins, but they took 50 mins to get my order ready. I had to stand there for 30 mins with nothing to do and watch people around and waste my time. When I politely raised my concern on the delay to the owner, he told these words - " YOU DON'T HAVE TO COME TO MY RESTAURANT AGAIN. THIS IS HOW IT IS AND ITS NOT UNDER MY CONTROL". It was so embarrassing in front of everyone.   This Gentleman is filled with Ego and has no respect to the customers coming to his place. He thinks he is doing us all a favor by running his joint. I STRONGLY DISLIKE THIS PLACE.   They need to change their attitude towards customers otherwise they are gonna lose customers.

If the thought of Brazilian Wax freaks you out, you need Courtenay. She is the best not only at her profession but also personally. She is super kind and very caring. She listens to your problems and is super careful. I will give her 11 out of 10. I don't know what I will do without Courtney.
