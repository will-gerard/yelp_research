The only reason I feel inclined to write a review for the Palladium is because the management is a night and day difference in comparison to San Marin.   I've lived at both complexes and I would imagine most people reading these reviews are trying to decide between the two. The management style is always very accommodating and extremely quick to respond to maintenance issues. (I had a broken washer and wet carpets they came to fix and clean up within 2 hours of my request). At San Marin when I had a broken A/C unit during the peak of the summer it took them almost two weeks before they came to fix it.    Unless San Marin rent is less than half of what Palladium is, You should absolutely choose to live here.

1) service was mediocre.  2) I did not receive my meal, the owner, not the waiter, had to come and tell me that they didn't have what I ordered after an hour of waiting.  3) the owner didn't actually make up for anything and said that he was "sorry"  4) I left hungry and the original waiter never came back to the table after the food was brought because he knew that he had screwed our table over.

I'm trying to think of a better thing to happen to Oldtown Scottsdale in the past 15 years than the arrival of Wadaa tacos. I can't.

5 Stars for these tacos. 6 when your drunk off tequila. Now go here and cherish every chewing moment.

Best bagel sandwich in Oldtown Scottsdale  for the price. This is a great quick and easy breakfast spot. Don't understand the mediocre reviews. Definitely recommend

Found this place on yelp and I was very happy with the work they did on both my dress shoes and luggage that had a broken strap. Pretty reasonably priced also

If your looking for a great mens haircut go see Nicole. After trying a few other places in oldtown before finding Waverly (formerly Krush) there's no reason to keep looking. You will definitely be happy.
