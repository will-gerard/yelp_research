I hate Fate!    My fate at Fate has always been to have a mediocre meal that takes too long.  Don't even bother with a group as it only makes the servers even more surly than normal and the food even slower to arrive.  The last time I was there, I was with a group (bad idea, per my comment above).  Several folks asked that their food be prepared mild.  When the food came, every dish on the table was nuclear hot.  I can handle hot food, but this was on par with Los Dos Molinos.  When we mentioned this to our server, she told us that it all has to do with the peppers they have on hand at any given time.  She patiently explained that the heat levels of the peppers vary (Duh!), but the chef always uses the same amount of pepper and never tastes the food.  Therefore, the heat level varies wildly and there is no consistency.  Frankly, any chef who doesn't taste their food needs to get out of the kitchen and into another line of work.  The concept of the menu with the various preparations and the choice of proteins is great.  Sadly, Fate falls apart in its execution.  It's a lot less flashy, but you get a consistent meal at China Chili where they also know how to regulate the heat in their food.  Apparently their chefs actually taste their dishes.

Stuff Antiques is a period lighting fantasy land.  Joe, the proprietor, has amassed a literal treasure trove of fine period lighting.  He has an eye for the exceptional and his shop is literally filled to the rafters with only the best examples of each period and lighting style.  Whatever style of vintage lighting you're looking for, Joe has it.  He's got everything from Victorian to Arts and Crafts; from Art Deco to Mid-century Modern and everything in between.  Don't be put off if you arrive and the iron gate at the front entrance is locked.  Do as the sign instructs and ring the bell.  Joe is likely in the back restoring more fabulous lighting and he will come right to the front and let you in.  Once you walk in, welcome to Lighting Wonderland!  Take the time to work your way among the aisles and aisles of lighting.  Don't forget to look overhead because that's where the fabulous ceiling fixtures reign supreme.  This place feels more like a museum of exceptional lighting than a shop, but everything can be yours.  Joe also carries some antique furniture and vintage medical cabinets.  Again, everything is the best of the best at Stuff Antiques.  I normally have a rule that I will not shop in an antiques store that does not having price tags.  Joe does not have price tags on anything in his shop.  However, he knows precisely what everything is worth and he has all the prices memorized.  I have asked more than once about the same item on different visits and the price doesn't change.  This also isn't a place where you bargain.  The price is the price and that's that.  However, Joe has exceptional examples of everything and his prices are fair.  Joe also offers restoration services.  The BF had a vintage lamp that he inherited that we took to Joe for an assessment.  The lamp had been damaged by a well-intentioned polishing in the past and Joe was able to advise us on the best course of action to restore the lamp to its former beauty and to optimize its value.    Besides being an expert on vintage lighting, Joe is also very engaging and easy to work with.  I found a fantastic vintage Art Deco milk glass school house light at his shop that I just had to have.  Unfortunately, I needed two for my kitchen that I was remodeling at the time.  I managed to find an exact match to the glass shade on eBay and I took it to Joe and he was able to get me a set of matching vintage metal setups so that the shades are now a perfectly matched set.  Joe offers the old fashioned customer service that chain stores can't even begin to touch.  Take an afternoon to explore Stuff Antiques, even if you don't need anything.  If you have a lighting fetish, this can be a very, very dangerous place for your wallet.  But it's worth it to live with beauty on a daily basis.

China Chili is the restaurant that Orange Chicken built.  While that dish is tasty, this place has so much more to offer.  Venture away from the lure of the Orange Chicken tractor beam and try such tasty morsels as:  Boiled Won Tons -- a standout dish; the spicy peanut sauce is more like broth than sauce, but in a good way Chicken Corn Chowder -- a reliable standby Honey Walnut Prawns -- deep-fried shrimp enrobed in mayonnaise with honey walnuts; what's not to love? Lover's Prawns -- half the prawns are in wine sauce and the other half are in spicy chili garlic sauce; very balanced Pillow Chicken -- along the lines of deep-fried chicken croquettes with savory Black Pepper Sauce Sichuan Style String Beans (with pork) -- a fantastically spicy dish  The lunch menu includes a number of their most popular dishes (including Orange Chicken, of course) that are very tasty and wallet-friendly as they include a cup of the daily soup and an egg roll.  This restaurant is run by a large extended family and the place has a very convivial atmosphere.  The people watching here is great.  The customers represent a broad range of Phoenix residents and there are usually a few gay peeps in the house, which is always a bonus.    The decor at China Chili really improved when they moved from Central Avenue due to the Light Rail.  This place doesn't have the decor of C-Fu Gourmet, but it is pleasant enough.  The enlarged dining room can now accommodate a crowd, which has really cut down from the long waits at their previous location that was so much smaller.   Besides table service and take out, China Chili also caters.  The BF and I recently used them for our Tacky Tiki Gay Pride Brunch.  Johnny handles the catering and he's great to work with.  We asked Johnny to create an appetizer buffet, which was something China Chili had not done before.  They did a great job building a custom menu for us and the food was great.  I highly recommend their catering; it's a great way to feed a crowd on a moderate budget.

Since the BF moved to Phoenix last fall, I've been taking him on an informal tour of old school Phoenix eateries.  As part of our vintage dining tour, we finally make it to Katz Delicatessen & Sandwich Shop.  It definitely has an old school feel right down to the vintage diner interior.  The food was fine.  The bagels and cream cheese were good, but not outstanding.  Our lunches were serviceable, but forgettable.  It was amusing to watch the antics of the staff that outnumbered the diners at lunch by nearly 3:1.  With so many people out front, it appeared that there was only one short order cook and our food took way too long for simple deli offerings.  The real negative for me was the restroom.  I'm not expecting a marble shrine like the men's room at the Ritz-Carlton, but I want the rest room at a place that serves food to be clean and somewhat up to date.  The men's room at Katz was on par with some gas station restrooms that I have been unfortunate enough to see.  We're talking totally gross El Bano del Diablo here.  The dining room itself also needs a thorough cleaning, but the restroom was totally off-putting for me.

Homer Simpson: Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Lisa, honey, are you saying you're never going to eat any animal again? What about bacon? Lisa Simpson: No. Homer Simpson: Ham? Lisa Simpson: No. Homer Simpson: Pork chops? Lisa Simpson: Dad! Those all come from the same animal! Homer Simpson: [Chuckles] Yeah, right Lisa. A wonderful, magical animal.  The pig is indeed a wonderful, magical animal and Schreiner's Fine Sausage is a wonderful, magical place that offers the full range of porcine products.  This is a pork-lover's paradise!  My favorite is the homemade slab bacon because it doesn't taste as salty as bacon you can buy elsewhere.  They will also slice the bacon to your desired thickness.  What could be better?  I like my bacon sliced nice and thick (setting number 6) so that the pieces cook up lovely and crisp.  I top my homemade Curried Deviled Eggs with pieces of Schreiner's crispy bacon.  You can also buy the slab bacon if you have a recipe that calls for you to make your own lardons.  Schreiner's offers over 60 varieties of homemade sausages.  They feature everything from Bratwurst, Italian and Polish sausages to the hard-to-find items such as: Andouille and Tasso (Cajun); Linguisa (Portuguese); Bangers (English); Chorico (Spanish); Chorizo (Mexican); and Cheese Sausage.  They also have homemade lunch meats, hickory-smoked hams and more.  Don't overlook their wall of pickles and pantry items.  The Frisch-Gurken baby pickles that the BF and I picked up here are the cutest addition to a relish tray.  The pig is a wonderful, magical animal and Schreiner's Fine Sausage is a wonderful, magical place.

Time has not been kind to Flavors of India.  I just went back for dinner after a couple of years of inadvertently overlooking this place.  It appears that the management has changed and FOI is not better for it.  Perhaps the lunch buffet is still a good deal for the quality and quantity of the food they serve.  For dinner, it's offensive to charge $.99 for a side of rice to go with an order of Chicken Tikka Masala.  It's not an issue of the cost, but the principle of the matter.  Obviously, I'm going to order the rice.  Just up the price of all the dishes by a buck and throw us a bone with "free" rice.  And nearly $3 for a bowl of soupy Raita?  They need to change the name of this place to Nickel and Dime.         Farewell, Flavors of India, farewell!

Everyone has a vice and I am quick to admit that mine is Williams-Sonoma.  It started off innocent enough.  I would browse every now and again and marvel at the array of products.  Back then, I would never really buy anything, but I would promise myself that I could have whatever I wanted once I renovated my kitchen.  It took me a long time to achieve that goal, but eventually I did.  Then the flirtation blossomed into my first purchase.  My torrid affair with Williams-Sonoma has been raging for a couple of years now.  In Phoenix, the Biltmore Fashion Park store is my favorite Williams-Sonoma location.  The one at the Fashion Square is okay, but it feels cramped.  I travel for business and I seek out Williams-Sonoma stores on the road.  The one in Oak Brook (suburban Chicago) is nice.  The store in Walnut Creek, CA is also nice.  The new flagship in Union Square in San Francisco is like Williams-Sonoma Mecca!  It's four floors of everything Williams-Sonoma carries as well as artifacts from Chuck Williams' own kitchen.  It's like a Williams-Sonoma museum combined with the entire product line.  As a side note, the original Williams-Sonoma store that was on the square in Sonoma has been closed.  The Union Square store replaced it.  Williams-Sonoma is the best!  The products are all of the finest quality and they stand by everything they sell.  If you ever have a problem, they will take the item back with no questions asked and give you store credit if you don't have your receipt.     I've bought everything at Williams-Sonoma from my Le Creuset Doufeu to Fleur de Sel French sea salt.  If you love to cook, this is the place for you.  If you bake or cook a lot, be sure to check out their All-Clad Stainless Steel Measuring Cups & Spoons.  The measuring cups are adorable because they're miniature versions of the All-Clad saucepan.  For standard measures, they offer sets of both four cups and spoons: 1/4, 1/3, 1/2 and 1 cup; 1/4 tsp, 1/2 tsp, 1 tsp and 1 Tbs.  The really handy items are the odd-size sets.  They offer sets of both cups and spoons in the following odd sizes: 2/3 cup, 3/4 cup and 1 1/2 cups; 2 tsp, 1 1/2 Tbs and 2 Tbs.  All the spoons stack together into a cute space-saving group.  All four sets of measures make an awesome gift!  Don't overlook their website.  Sometimes they will have Special Offers for products online that can be upwards of 50% off of the same items in the stores.  This drives the BF a bit crazy because he thinks their pricing should be consistent across all retail channels, but I'm willing to check their website frequently as I have found a number of bargains online.

As a rule, I avoid hotel restaurants.  However, I am pleased to break my rule for T. Cook's at the Royal Palms Resort.    Look no further than T. Cook's for the best place in Phoenix for a romantic dinner with your sweetie.  This place is tops in terms of atmosphere.  The grounds of the Royal Palms Resort are impeccable and the whole place has the vibe of a genteel estate you wish was handed down from generation to generation in your own family.  This place oozes Old World/Spanish Colonial charm in a good way.  Arrive a few minutes early and stroll the grounds before your dinner.  Check out the courtyard and the reflecting pool.  It's amazing to think that before this place underwent a multi-million dollar renovation, there was a pink heart-shaped pool on the grounds.  The kitsch is gone and this grand dame has been returned to her 1920s grace.    Given the spectacular setting, T. Cook's doesn't have to be as good as it is.  The BF and I have enjoyed several fine meals at this restaurant.  The decor of the restaurant is lovely, of course.  Check out the palm tree that grows up through the roof.  The room features colonial Spanish architecture, a vaulted ceiling and ubiquitous Old World elegance.  The service is also graceful and relaxed.     As for the food, the real surprise is the seafood is at T. Cook's.  In fact, the very best seafood I have eaten in Phoenix has been at T. Cook's.  I am always a sucker for lobster bisque and the version at T. Cook's is top notch.  It's lush and silky and every bit as indulgent as lobster bisque should be.  The scallops are also outstanding and perfectly prepared.  I'm not one to order fish as my entree very often, but the BF and I have done that at T. Cook's with wonderful results.  Try the seafood here, it's truly spectacular.  T. Cook's is very proud of its fire-roasted specialties and the fireplace is gorgeous and really adds to the atmosphere.  One time our waiter suggested we try the Mediterranean paella with the optional  lobster tail and claw.  This was the one main dish we would not order again.  The paella tasted like it sat around partially cooked and then they just warmed it over the fire when we ordered it.  I'd never order this dish again, but I would not let this stand in my way of coming back to T. Cook's, either.  One time we tried the Cream Cheese Brulee because it's T. Cook's signature dessert.  It's a caramel cheesecake and vanilla creme brulee served with fresh berries and guava sauce.  Unfortunately, it was sickly, sickly sweet.  I'm not a huge fan of creme brulee in general and this one didn't alter my opinion.  However, other desserts were much better.  Stop by the Lounge at T. Cook's for an after-dinner aperitif.  The atmosphere is very cozy and this place is hopping many nights.  T. Cook's also has the Delos Room for private dining.  This would be a fabulous place for an intimate dinner with up to 12 friends.  What a great place for a milestone birthday or anniversary celebration.

Dry Clean Only is the standard admonition on nearly every designer garment.  No matter how fabulous your pret-a-porter or couture, the reality is that if you wear it, it's going to get dirty.  The rule seem to be the more expensive and delicate the garment, the more likely you will be to spill tomato sauce on it at dinner.  When your precious garment is sullied, do you trust it to just any dry cleaner?  Given the significant investment that fine clothes represent, it's worth a visit to Z Cleaners.    For proof of how much customers trust Z Cleaners, you need look no further than the garment conveyer.  It's a literal designer merry-go-round.  You'll see high-end labels like Prada, Armani, Versace, Gucci, Michael Kors, Bironi, Jhane Barnes, etc go whizzing by.  The conveyor looks like it's been stocked by Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue, Nordstrom, Bergdorf Goodman, Ralph Lauren, Barney's, and myriad designer boutiques because it has.  I've been a faithful customer of Z Cleaners since it opened nearly a decade ago.  It started out as my neighborhood dry cleaner when I lived in North Scottsdale.  I moved to downtown Phoenix six years ago, but Z Cleaners does such an outstanding job that I continue to use them as my dry cleaner.  So what makes Z Cleaners so great?  First, it's an impeccable attention to detail.  When you first bring a garment to Z Cleaners, they add a small barcode to the tag in order to associate it to your account.  The garment is tracked in your account by designer and color.  Every time you bring the garment to the shop, it's scanned into their system and they can track its progress from sullied to snazzy.  They also hand inspect every piece of clothing (or housewares) that comes into the store and everything comes out of this place looking top notch.  Dress shirts that I wear for work have lasted six years or more and I attribute that to the careful pampering they receive at Z Cleaners.  They even removed an ink stain from the cuff of a BF's shirt that had been there for four years before he moved to the Valley of the Sun.  We never bothered to tell them about the stain because it was so old.  The shirt came back with a note that read, "I knew if I worked on it hard enough, I would get it out."  Another huge benefit is that Z Cleaners actually returns your clothes fresh.  I used to loathe taking anything to the dry cleaner because garments often return from lesser cleaners reeking with the stench of dry cleaning solution.  Those places reuse the same dry cleaning solution over and over again, so that reek is actually the build up of soil from other people's garments.  Ew!  That's not the case at Z Cleaners where the cleaning solutions themselves are cleansed and distilled after each use so garments are returned absolutely odor-free.   Then there's the convenience factor.  If you go during business hours, you can sit in your car under the drive-thru portico and they will schlep your clothes for you.  I never seem to get to their store when it's open.  No problem, because Z Cleaners has a solution for that.  They've taken an over-size ATM and attached it to their store resulting in a designer garment dispenser.  They call it the Z Cleaners 24-Hour Valet and you can pick up and drop off your garments at Z Cleaners any time, day or night, seven days a week.  Is this some "Jetsons" vision of the future?  No, it's been a reality at Z Cleaners for nearly a decade.    They also offer a hanger buy-back program. They give you a compact box to keep in your closet to collect your hangers.  When it's full, you bring it back and they give you a $20 credit toward your next order.  It's a nice green touch.  In terms of price point, Z Cleaners can be spendy.  However, given the cost of fine clothing today, it's worth it to have experts who really care about your garments take care of them for you.  In nearly a decade, Z Cleaners has returned hundreds of orders to me where the clothes looked as good, if not better, than new.  It does seem that there's a pricing hierarchy in place as it's more expensive for them to handle an Armani shirt than the Nordstrom brand.    Z Cleaners promises, "When you entrust your garments, household or specialty items to us, we return them to you brighter, cleaner and fresher than you would have imagined possible."  They consistently deliver on that promise.  This is a place where I always know the rumpled mess of clothes I bring them will return to me perfectly fresh, pressed and renewed.

Chef Rubber is a culinary wonderland!  They offer an amazing assortment of top-notch products paired with excellent customer service.    Chef Rubber is among a very small "inner circle" of trusted vendors for my high-end custom cake studio.  They offer an incredible product range including unique molds for gum paste / fondant, gorgeous colorants, detailed chocolate molds, stylish disposable plastic plates, etc.    Chef Rubber is wonderful to work with when you need custom products.  We have collaborated with them on custom decor powder luster colors to match the stationary from our high end weddings and they did an amazing job.    Rest assured that anything you purchase from Chef Rubber will be absolutely top notch.

This is THE place to be if you want to catch the Ethel Merman of piano players.  Nicole Pesce pounds out those keys for the benefit of the BACK row, baby!  Whenever Nicole's there (most weekend nights) the BF and I try to sit as far away from her as possible and I always tell the person seating us, but it doesn't seem to matter.  Apparently the show must go on.    Nicole plays well, but she doesn't need to bang away at the keys of her concert grand.  The dining room is fairly small and made up of hard surfaces, so the acoustics are good enough for softer piano playing.  I was once subjected to sitting next to the piano when I was there with a group and there was no other seating option.  This was in the old days when it would take an hour and a half or longer for a salad.  It was like being banished to a really, really loud dining/show tune purgatory.  In fairness, I have also heard Nicole play at the brunch at the Ritz-Carlton and there she tones down the volume and you can really appreciate her significant talents.  At My Florist, be sure to watch her bounce her head along to the beat as she looks around the room; it's like getting a show along with your mediocre dinner.  A number of reviewers wonder why My Florist survives when the food and service are okay at best.  Sure the bread is as hard as a rock because it doesn't contain any preservatives and you can only get a sandwich or a salad, but My Florist is one of the few restaurants in the immediate area that serves dinner late.  On the flip side, you'll be paying too much and the service will range from spotty to surly.  I think many of the male servers and bar tenders are hired more for their looks than their restaurant experience.  This ups the gay vibe, which is nice, but it doesn't help the place run smoothly.  If there were more late night dining options in the area, I don't think My Florist would enjoy the business that it has.  As an aside, if you're wondering why the menu is limited to sandwiches and salads, it's because the kitchen is set up as a bakery.  They've got an oven, but they don't have a stove.  I skip breakfast here because they're prepping your eggs in a microwave.  The decor is modern and spare; like AZ-88 and Postino had a love child.  One of my most memorable dining experiences was one afternoon when I was having lunch at My Florist and the sun was shining on the south side of the restaurant and it was pouring rain on the north side of the restaurant.  That's a good analogy for My Florist Cafe.  It's got style, but the food and service are okay at best.  If AZ-88 ran without a stove, the food would be similar to what you get at My Florist.      My Florist if fine so long as you go there with very limited expectations and a small appetite.  It's a gussied up sandwich and salad place that makes it due to a lack of competition.    Bang on, Nicole, bang on!

When I mention Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles to the uninitiated, I often get a reaction that chicken and waffles is an unusual combination. From a culinary point of view, chefs continually strive for balance. With Lo-Lo's you get balance between savory fried chicken and sweet waffles. It's like joy on a plate!   For those in the know about Phoenix soul food, there is a fair bit of confusion about the link between Lo-Lo's and Mrs. White's Golden Rule Cafe. For the record, Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles is owned by Larry "Lo-Lo" White, the grandson of Mrs. White, the owner of Phoenix landmark Mrs. White's Golden Rule Cafe.   Lo-Lo's is the best value-for-your-dollar restaurant in Phoenix. You can eat like a Soul Food King for $15 including your beverage (try half sweet tea and half regular iced tea to fend off the diabetic coma) and tip.   I usually order the Betty Boop, which includes a fried chicken breast and a waffle. I make it real Betty Boop by adding a second breast. I'm always tempted by Aunt Hattie's Salmon Croquettes, but I invariably go for chicken and waffles instead because they are SO good!   The fried chicken at Lo-Lo's is utterly delicious. Some reviewers have noted that it can take a while to get your food at Lo-Lo's. I challenge those detractors to fry chicken from scratch at home. Fried chicken is simply something that cannot be rushed. I fry my own chicken and it takes 18-20 minutes to fry a skillet of chicken. If you try to rush it, you burn the coating and skin and the meat does not cook through. Baring this in mind, I never complain if it takes a while to get my food at Lo-Lo's. Yes, there can be a bit of a wait when they're really busy, but I cannot express how happy I am not to be the poor soul slaving over a stove filled with skillets of frying chicken. Apparently some customers have tried to stop by Lo-Lo's in a rush to catch a flight at nearby Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport as they've posted a sign that reads:  "If you have a plane to catch, then maybe Lo-Lo's just might not be the place for you...PLEASE try us again when you have mo' time!  THX."  Besides the chicken, the waffles are delicious as they're loaded with vanilla and they're crispy and brown on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside. The warmed syrup adds that final touch of sugary goodness. You'll also see an eye-popping "dollop" of butter served with each waffle. This isn't a restaurant for the calorie-conscious, so spread the butter over your waffle, pour on the syrup, and dive in, honey!  The side dishes at Lo-Lo's are worthy of attention on their own. The Collard Greens are sublime and they're my favorite. They're always perfectly cooked and spicy. Lo-Lo claims all the side dishes are vegetarian and if they are, I tip my hat to him. I'm a bit dubious because the collard greens taste like they're loaded with rendered bacon fat and that makes them oh, so tasty! The BF agrees with me on the question about the vegetarian sides, not that either of us cares. The Mac and Cheese is excellent if you get it when it's fresh and the sauce remains nice and creamy. If you get it after it's been sitting for a while, it becomes a bit too congealed. The Rice and Gravy is tasty because the gravy is the star and it does not disappoint. Fried Okra has been added to the menu and it's great. The BF relishes the Cheese Grits and Lo-Lo does not skimp on the cheese or butter.   For dessert (or Sanny Sand's in Lo-Lo speak) Red Velvet Cake is a bit of a disappointment. Red Velvet Cake should be remarkably tender and the texture of the version at Lo-Lo's is unfortunately reminiscent of corn bread. The cream cheese frosting is good, but not good enough to offset the overly coarse texture of the cake. After everything else, dessert is pretty much superfluous at Lo-Lo's anyway. Enjoy a waffle as your dessert if you must indulge in a final course.  This place is a true hole in the wall. If it seems small now with a grand total of 49 seats, imagine how tiny it was before they added the "west wing" as the six tables with 24 seats in the elongated room to the west didn't exist in the original footprint. However, this place has its own brand of ambiance and charm. Lo-Lo's walls in the room with the counter are lined with autographs of famous guests including Amare Stoudemire, Charles Barkley, Curly Neal, former Governor Rose Mofford, Larry Fitzgerald, Too Short, Ken Griffey, and WWII Tuskegee Airmen heroes.  I like to go for what I call "Gospel Brunch." On Sunday mornings you'll get the added treat of watching folks in their Sunday best after church. You'll see some awesome outfits and some super-stylish hats. One of my favorite memories of Lo-Lo's was a mature woman who ordered takeout in the late spring and waited in her Cadillac outside with the engine running and A/C on because she was in a floor-length fur coat!   Thank you Lo-Lo for enriching the culinary heritage of Phoenix. I'm sure Mrs. White is very proud of you indeed.

The new location is much bigger and GORGEOUS!  It's located on Central Avenue in a beautifully renovated building that Larry and Rasheedah White saved to preserve some South Phoenix history. The new restaurant is right around the corner from the tiny original location that will soon be torn down to complete the new parking lot.  Don't worry the food is as delicious as ever. The setting is now "Palais du Poulet" but the grub is hood fo'ever.

Dr. Thomas Durisek and his crew at Open Wide Dental (OWD) rock!  I first came to Dr. Durisek a few yeas ago after seeing his ads in the local gay publications.  I've been a patient ever since because Open Wide Dental does such a great job.  The Open Wide Dental web site states, "Our commitment is to provide you the highest standard of personalized dental care with a gentle, efficient and professional manner. We trust you will find the atmosphere calming, the staff friendly, and our dental services exceptional."  I'm pleased to report that OWD delivers on their promise.  You know your dentist is gay when you can compliment the decor of the office.  Dr. Durisek remodeled the space his practice now occupies and it is state-of-the-art. The waiting area looks more like the living room of a gay couple who subscribes to "Dwell" magazine and shops at IKEA than the usual dreary dental office.  The two massage chairs from The Sharper Image also get lots of use.  Check out the photos on the OWD web site as I didn't know you could get dental office Glamour Shots!  Beyond mere appearances, it's the people who make the difference at Open Wide Dental.  Theresa is by far the best dental hygienist I have ever encountered.  My teeth form lots of tartar and she does an exceptional job cleaning them.  She is extremely gentle and the only hygienist who has not caused me pain while cleaning my teeth. The new office set up is nice as flat panel monitors are mounted to the ceiling over the treatment chairs, so you get to watch calming DVDs while they work on your teeth.  Dr. Durisek told me some patients have asked for TV shows or movies, but they've kept it to nature scenes and the like so far.    Dr. Durisek himself is great.  He's friendly, kind, patient, gentle and professional.  On my first visit, I filled out a form and one of the questions asked why I went to Open Wide Dental and I responded, "My previous dentist was a jerk."  I really appreciated that Dr. Durisek had the balls to ask me about the previous dentist based on my comment.  Right then I knew we would enjoy mutual respect going forward.  In fact, I trusted him enough to follow his advice of filling a small cavity without any local anesthetic.  He assured me that the cavity was small enough that I did not need local anesthetic and if I started to feel any pain at all during the procedure, all I had to do was raise a hand and he would hook me up with some Novocaine.  I've found that the injection of Novocaine for previous dental work was an awful experience on its own and Dr. Durisek was right on the money.  He was able to fill my cavity without any anesthetic and I didn't feel any pain at all.    If you've got teeth, then Open Wide Dental is the place for you to take care of them!

Unfortunately, I must update my review based on my most recent dining experience at Mi Patio.  The BF and I stopped in on a Saturday night for a late dinner right before closing.  I have a cast-iron stomach and I almost never have problems with anything I eat.    I ordered the taco salad with beef machaca.  When it arrived, the beef was cold and I only ate two bites as a result.  I surmise the beef had been left out to cool (probably for too long) since the restaurant was about to close.  Needless to say, a few short hours later in the middle of the night I came down with the worst case of food poisoning I have ever experienced.  This wasn't "Oh, I don't feel so good" food poisoning.  This was, "Should I go to the hospital?" food poisoning.  It was so bad I was unable to travel for work the following week.    Mi Patio is now permanently off my list of acceptable eateries; it's just not worth the risk.  Adios, Mi Patio!

"Old World Italy in Chandler, AZ" sounds like the set up for a joke.  You wouldn't expect to find one of the best Italian restaurants in metro Phoenix located in downtown Chandler, but that's the case with La Stalla Cucina Rustica.   The decor clearly conveys the Old World focus of the restaurant.  From the wood tables and chairs to the faux finished walls and the hand painted murals, this place is evocative of rural Italy.  If you've traveled throughout Italy, the atmosphere at La Stalla won't magically transport you back, but you will appreciate the elements that have been gathered together to bring a bit of the old school Italian vibe to downtown Chandler.  After all, that's no small feat.   The food is traditional and consistently good.  Don't come here for cutting-edge Italian, but for the classics.  For appetizers, the Calamari Fritti ($12) features crispy calamari and a spicy marinara sauce.  I do not order calamari because it's usually not fresh in Arizona, but it's a favorite of my dear friend who lives in Chandler and the La Stalla version is pretty good.  The Pasta e Fagioli soup ($6) is true to the classic and features tender cannellini beans and pasta.  They sometimes feature an appetizer special of stuffed mushrooms that are baked in their brick oven and they are fantastic.  For pasta dishes, the Tortelloni Panna Proscuitto e Piselli ($18) includes tortelloni pasta with ham and peas in a cheese cream sauce.  It's unbelievably rich.  We're talking heart attack on a plate rich, but it's darn tasty.  Spaghetti alla Carbonara ($18) is another true-to-form old school dish.  It features spaghetti with smoked pancetta in a parmesan egg cream sauce.  The BF enjoys the Risotto Agli Scampi ($19) that combines baby shrimp and arborio rice.  In the entree category, Involtini di Vitello ($23) is the favorite of my Chandler friend.  It features mozzarella and prosciutto wrapped in veal and pan seared in a sherry sauce.  Personally, I avoid this dish due to the veal.  I'm starting to come around to veal and will try it as soon as I find a restaurant that offers true free range veal.  Be sure to ask about the specials because they are often excellent and even the vegetables served alongside many of the entrees are perfectly seasoned.   Here's an admonition to La Stalla and other spendy Italian restaurants in Phoenix:  Grated parmesan cheese (even Parmigiano Reggiano) is not a controlled substance.  It's cheese, not crack.  Please do not make a huge deal out of spooning out the tiniest amount for me on top of my soup or pasta.  When I ask for grated cheese, just leave me a small bowl at the table to use at my discretion.  You can trust me to not bring a Ziploc bag to steal what I don't use during my dinner.  If the cost of the cheese is an issue, then tack a dollar or two onto each dish and be done with it because the food cost of the cheese should already be factored into your prices.  The cost of the grated cheese at La Stalla should not be an issue because the price point of the menu has risen noticeably in the past year.  For desserts, the standout is the Fruta di bosco con Zabaione ($9).  It's a mix of seasonal berries topped with Grand Marnier Zabaione sauce.  I always marvel at the perfect, beautiful berries that La Stalla manages to source at all times.  The Zabaione sauce is generously flavored with Grand Marnier and sugar and it's whipped up to a delightfully fluffy texture.  It's flat out fantastic!  The Chocolate "Souffle" ($10) is more of a molten chocolate cake than a true chocolate souffle that you would find at Christopher's.  However, it's the favorite of my Chandler friend, so it often gets ordered.  If you're lucky, you will be offered a shot of the housemade Limoncello to finish off your meal.  It's popular and they often run out, but it is the perfect end to a meal at La Stalla.  La Stalla is a bit spendy.  Dinner for two can easily near $100 with appetizers, soups/salads, pasta dishes or entrees, desserts, drinks, tax and tip. The quality is definitely worth the expense, but this is not your inexpensive neighborhood Italian joint.  As my Italian Grandmothers would say, "Mange! Mange!"

I discovered the delights of Haji-Baba when I was in grad school at ASU (gulp) 10 years ago.  I decided to take the BF for dinner recently when we were in the Tempe area.  I was pleased that Haji-Baba has stood the test of time.  The decor was exactly as I remembered it.  The market side was still chock-full of Middle Eastern staples.  The bakery case was filled to the brim with homemade baklava.  The dining area even had the same murals on the walls.  Very little has changed indeed at Haji-Baba in the last 10 years.  Haji-Baba offers great value-for-your-dollar.  You get a large quantity of tasty food for a very wallet-friendly price.  Don't get me wrong, this isn't the greatest Middle Eastern food served in the US, but it's very solid.  There's a reason Haji-Baba has been a staple with ASU students over the years.    The hummus was tasty and so were the olives.  The Gyro Plate had so much meat on it that I had to take half to go for lunch the next day.  The gyro meat is very good here, but it's not the best I have ever tasted.  That was at Jimmy's Gyros in Mykonos, Greece.  But I can certainly make do with Haji-Baba.

This place is serviceable, but don't expect any Las Vegas glamor or luxury. It looks to be a converted apartment complex. The weirdest part was that the light switches are outside each room. So I would walk into the kitchen and then remember I needed to go out into the living room to turn on the lights. Or I would walk into the bathroom and then remember I needed to walk out into the bedroom to turn on the light. Weird.   The decor looks like it was picked up on clearance at Marshall's.  It has an odd cowboy theme and the fake cowboy boots beside the fireplace were really bizarre.  At first I thought they belonged to the BF's brother and I thought, "Why the Hell did he bring those to Vegas?"    The shuttle was really a joke. Cabs to the strip were about $15 each. Not all cabbies will want to take you this far off the strip and some will lie and claim they don't know where Spencer street is located, which is total BS.   This place is okay so long as you get your expectations in check.

The dichotomy between the "love it" or "hate it" reviews of Barrio Cafe can be traced back to the concept for this restaurant.  This place isn't trying to replicate the standard Mexican neighborhood joint.  There is also a misconception in the US that Mexican food is universally spicy -- it's not, that's Tex-Mex.  If you're looking for hyper-spicy food, go to Los Dos Molinos instead.  If you're ready for sublime and subtle modern/urban Mexican food, then Barrio Cafe is the place for you.  Just be prepared that a dinner with drinks will not fall into the wallet-friendly category at Barrio Cafe.  The focus of Barrio Cafe is southern Mexican food as reinterpreted by Chef Silvana Salcido Esparza as well as her original creations.  While the food is pricey and the portions have been noticeably reduced recently, you can pretty much throw a dart at the menu and pick out a winning dish.  For appetizers, many diners are beguiled by the table-side preparation of the "elegant" Guacamole Casero.  To avoid disappointment, please note that the guacamole is only prepared at your table during dinner.  At lunch, it is prepped in the kitchen.  While the guacamole is good (and even better when pomegranates are in season as the seeds add a tangy crunch), it is a bit spendy at $10.50 for a moderate serving.  Splash out $16 and try the Quesadilla de Langosta Borracha (lobster quesadilla) since it's a unique dish you will be hard-pressed to find elsewhere in Phoenix.  The Sopa de Chile Morron (sweet and spicy pepper soup) is divine due to its silky/creamy texture.  If you ask, they will divide the bowl into two cups so that you can share it with another lucky diner.  The entrees offer a robust and varied selection of delicious dishes.  The Cochinita Pibil (12 hour slow roasted pork) is succulent and well-rounded in flavor due to the achiote rojo & sour orange.  When pomegranates are in season, the Chiles en Nogada (roasted poblano pepper stuffed with chicken, onions, garlic, pecans, apples, pears and apricots finished with a delicate almond sauce and pomegranates) is the standout dish from the menu and my standard order.  The BF's standard order is the Enchiladas Suizas (chicken enchiladas with tomatillo cream sauce).  The seafood enchiladas and the mushroom enchiladas are both excellent choices as well.  For lunch, the Torta de Pollo y Jaiba (Chicken breast topped with crab and spicy hollandaise) is an excellent choice.  It's certainly not low-cal, but it's utterly delicious.  If you manage to spare enough room for dessert, go for the signature option, Churros Rellenos de Cajeta de Cabra (fritters stuffed with goat's milk caramel).  You'll marvel at how they managed to fill the churros with all that tasty caramel.  They also offer a special Domingo menu for Sunday brunch.  The regular menu is also available during brunch, but options such as the Crepa de Pollo (chicken and asparagus filled crepe with a jocoqui sauce) should garner your attention.  Barrio Cafe offers a tremendous selections of tequila.  Their cocktails are all delicious, but be warned that they're strong and pricey.  The BF loves a good Paloma (Patron Reposado with Mexican Squirt soda and lime) and he enjoys the version at Barrio.  I enjoy the mango margarita.   The only negative point is around portion size.  When Barrio Cafe first opened in 2002, I thought then that the portions were a bit small for the prices.  Over time, the portions increased and the pricing seemed fair.  On my most recent visit, the portions had noticeably decreased again, but the prices had not.  Even our Skinny Minnie friends remarked that the portions were small.  Beyond the tremendous food, Barrio Cafe offers a funky atmosphere with "interesting" art on the walls.  Sometimes the art is quite good, sometimes it is just plain awful, but it's always a conversation point.  The restaurant is small and full of hard surfaces, so sound bounces all over the place.  It can get quite loud on weekend nights and the live music on the weekends adds to the din.  Try to sit away from the musicians and delight in a rare treat of a near-transcendental Mexican dinner.

The Tee Pee is not so bueno.  It does have a cool old school Arizona vibe that's hard to come by.  The decor is totally quirky.  It was amusing to watch parties of six sit in side-by-side booths for four and two.  The BF and I got  the "privilege" of sitting at the George W. Bush table.  Putting lame duck politics aside, the food was pretty lame as well.   The chips were greasy and the salsa was bland.  The Albondigas Soup was the best part of the meal.  The meatballs were tasty (but sparse) and the chicken broth was nicely spicy.  The fajitas left much to be desired.  The beef and chicken were both over- cooked while the onions were nearly raw.  The portions were okay for lunch, but they would be lacking for dinner (and we didn't order off of a lunch menu).    This place has a downscale touristy vibe.  I watched a group of six take multiple pictures of themselves in the quirky booths and of the food.  Perhaps they want the pictures for an exhibit of what Mexican food looked like in the US in the 1950s.  Time has marched on from the Tee Pee.  For wallet-friendly Mexican, check out Mi Patio on 7th Avenue.  For gourmet Mexican, head over to Barrio Cafe on 16th Street.

Meh. The "signature" lamb shank was tough/burned and the adobo was incredibly sour. The server never inquired about the uneaten entree.  The $11 margarita was meh.  The crab and mango salad was good. Not sure the food and service live up to the $pendy prices.

Gabi, you are indeed a good friend.  I've been to both locations in Chicago as well as this one in Vegas.  It's perfectly located in the Paris hotel.  For chain french food, this place is very good.  We went for brunch on a Sunday and enjoyed the crepes.  The smoked salmon and the cheese plate were also great appetizers.    If the weather permits, request to sit outside on the patio as it gives you a great view of the Bellagio fountains.  The atmosphere in the restaurant is very french, even if the crowd isn't.  The one odd thing was that they ran out of iced tea during our meal, but they made good on it by subtracting the teas from our bill.  Props to the Paris hotel for targeting the gay market.  The BF and I were pleased to be seated next to four family boys during our lunch.    All in all, brunch at Mon Ami Gabi is a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon in Las Vegas.

The BF and I decided to bring his younger brother here to celebrate his 26th birthday. I had eaten here a few years ago and I was hopeful that Picasso would be as good as I remembered. I was thrilled that it was every bit as good as I remembered.   Since we were in a festive mood, we ordered the Menu Dégustation. They also offered a wine pairing and I must admit that every wine paired perfectly with each dish. This should really not come as a surprise given that Picasso boasts an impressive wine menu.   Our meal consisted of:  * An amuse bouche of seasonal soup  * Maine Lobster Salad with Apple-Champagne Vinaigrette -- the flavors complemented, but did not overpower, the delicate lobster  * Pan Seared Sea Scallops with Potato Mousseline and Jus de Veau -- the scallops were perfectly cooked  * Sautéed "A" Steak of Foie Gras with Roasted Peaches, Vanilla, Muscat and Crushed Almonds -- the crushed almonds make this dish because they provide a contrasting texture; I actually preferred the taste of this foie gras dish to the one at Restaurant Guy Savoy at Caesars, but that one wins for unique foie gras presentation (see my Yelp of Restaurant Guy Savoy Las Vegas for more detail on that fab meal)  * Roast Lamb -- the meat was perfectly prepared. They decided to serve a fairly tall piece of lamb on its end for dramatic effect. The server tilted my BF's plate before he set it down and the lamb nearly slid off the plate. I made a joke about it trying to run away and the staff went with the humor.  * We added the cheese plate and they brought a nice selection * The desserts were wonderful and this place employs a talented pastry chef. The server caught my reference during dinner that we had a birthday at the table and they had written Happy Birthday in insanely beautiful script in chocolate on the birthday boy's plate with his opera cake. The BF had the apple beggar's purse with calvados and it was lovely. I opted for the molten chocolate cake on our server's recommendation (even though I am SO over molten chocolate cake) and I must admit it was delightful. The center was like a molten truffle. It came with boysenberry ice cream and some poor soul in the kitchen was so kind as to separate out individual segments of fresh boysenberries to adorn my plate.  * The post dinner truffles and other tiny bites were very good, but no match for the treat cart at Restaurant Guy Savoy.  The atmosphere of this place is utterly beautiful. Be sure to walk around the room and take in all the original Picasso masterpieces. The fresh flowers are gorgeous, especially the display on the large table in the main dining room.   It's also a hoot to watch the Bellagio fountains spewing outside the restaurant's windows every 15 minutes. Before you leave, step outside on the lakeside patio and catch the fountain show from this vantage point. You really get a sense of how high that water flies into the air.   Picasso remains a Las Vegas fine dining delight.

One of the BF's friends in Vegas was able to get us on this list for this amazing lounge. If you have the chance to hang out in the Foundation Room, go! It's an amazing experience.   For me, the atmosphere of this place is what puts it over the top. The entire lounge has a very sophisticated Asian theme. The walls are upholstered in red and orange patches of mirrored Indian fabric. The doors are heavily carved and you'll see Buddhas here and there. The couches and chairs also provide comfortable places to hang out. The balcony offers an amazing view of the strip.   The DJ was very good the night we were there. She played great music and kept the volume loud enough to keep the party going without making it so loud that you couldn't talk to the people around you.   Surprisingly, the drinks are reasonably priced for a lounge like this. The bartender also remembered what all four folks in my party were drinking. I am sure she was thrilled we drank round after round between our arrival around 11:00 PM and when the joint closed down at 3:00 AM. I agree with others that it was a bit odd this place didn't have a speciality drink menu.   Overall, this place rocks!

The Gelato Spot seems good UNTIL you try Arlecchino Gelateria.  If you're craving Gelato, do yourself the favor of cruising over to 40th Street and Campbell for the real deal.  But the Gelato Spot is open a bit later than Arlecchino, so I can see where you might have to settle for pre-fab gelato in a pinch.   The Gelato Spot has perfected its offering for its upscale neighborhood.  The imported cases are as gorgeous as those displaying jewels in a fine department store.  The wood and chrome cases proudly show off a huge array of flavors gussied up with trinkets that correspond to each flavor.  The variety is a problem because they offer too many flavors for each one to be handcrafted daily.  What proof do I have of this?  I offer up Exhibit A:  http://www.gelatospot.com/downloads/calendar.pdf.  There you will find a monthly calendar that lists out the flavors available every day of the month and the "special" flavors that run for about two weeks at a time.  Dear discerning foodie reader, if the Gelato Spot was seeking out the freshest local ingredients and handcrafting their gelato each day, how could they possibly know what they would produce for an entire month at a time?  I also offer up Exhibit B:  Blood Orange Sorbetto in May.  The season for blood oranges ended months ago, so they are offering a flavor out of season.  That's not a huge deal if you're willing to settle for variety over quality.  I've also noticed they tend not to adjust the freezers in the winter so that the gelato becomes overly frozen.  Of course, that's not a concern in the dead of a Phoenix summer.  It's nice that they adjoin a coffee shop next door.  In terms of amenities, decor and branding, the Gelato Spot has got it all if you're looking for a corporate experience and flash.  On one visit there was a soap dispenser in the rest room labeled "PLEASE DON'T STEAL ME."  It was gone by my follow up visit.  Apparently Arcadia is not untouched by petty crime.

Meh.  It's okay if you like your pizza crust soggy.  I've been several times before and the crust has always been soggy.  On my most recent visit I asked them to bake the crust longer to make it crispy.  It was soggy again.    Please note one point of caution regarding the other reviews of this restaurant.  This place may be quicker to get into, but it is most definitely NOT anywhere near the caliber of Pizzeria Bianco.  Would every pizza chef in town who has a James Beard Award please raise their hand?  On March 18th I received this message from Karen Martingilio:   Dear Ted, thanks for giving us a couple of tries, everyone has their opinion about what they like in a pizza, in Italy they use a knife and fork, we make our crust more soft and chewy more Italian style, and that does not appeal to everyone, however to imply that our other reviewers are just coming to us because the wait is shorter, or that we take less pride in our product then others is somewhat mean spirited, I m sure you didn t intend to insult our dedicated chef or our restaurant but unfortunately it could be misinterpeted by other Yelpers, you are intitled to your opinion and so are our fans on Yelp, thanks again for your imput, Karen Martingilio  Yelpers, as Karen notes above, I am entitled to my opinion.  Her email does not change my opinion in any way.

If you visit Trente-Cinq, you may well find yourself asking the question that is posed on the white board in the men's room: "Is this restaurant half empty or half full?" I've been to Trente-Cinq twice and both times the restaurant was no more than half full. That may be due to the fact that Belgian food is a novelty in Phoenix, but I think it also has to do with the value-for-your-dollar that this restaurant offers. Four of us had three salads, two appetizers, three entrees, two desserts, an iced tea and five glasses of wine. With tax and tip, the tab came to just under $200. It's like the menu is in Euros instead of US Dollars given the current lousy exchange rate. The problem is that we're dining in Phoenix, not somewhere in Belgium. Factoring in the "transitional" location on 7th Street, $200 is too much to pay for the meal that we had. No wonder there's always plenty of tables at Trente-Cinq.  Chef Lionel Geuskens states on his website, "I have always wanted to cook all of my favorite dishes." That's a laudable goal, but Chef Lionel needs to remember that his restaurant is located in the Valley of the Sun and not Belgium. He needs to add some seasonal dishes to his boilerplate menu. When I first visited in the fall, the hearty dishes were perfect for the season. When I recently had dinner with the BF and two friends at T-C in June, the menu seemed heavy and clunky. If the chef insists on keeping his hearty menu, he'd do well to close for the summer and wait for the weather to cool off before serving his stick-to-your-ribs fare.  I started off with the Boulettes ($10) appetizer. The menu says it's a dish of "mini" meatballs served in an herbed tomato sauce with mixed greens on the side. Three meatballs arrived that were as big as tennis balls. This dish was a good value as it could have been an entree, if you like eating thee meatballs for your dinner. The side salad was a weird accompaniment and very much appeared as an afterthought. The BF ordered the Salade D'endive ($9), which featured Belgian endive tossed with mixed greens, herbed goat cheese and candied walnuts with a raspberry vinaigrette. The portion was large, but the BF said my meatballs were a better choice.  For my entree, I ordered the Waterzooi ($23). This dish was also the entree I ordered on my first visit to T-C. It's basically a hearty fish soup of salmon, halibut, shrimp, scallops, mussels and vegetables in a saffron cream broth. Unfortunately, it was much tastier the first time. This time the sauce was fairly flat, which is a real disappointment given the saffron. The BF ordered what the menu purports to be the "national dish of Belgium," Moules Au Vin Blanc ($19). It is a bowl of mussels steamed in white wine with leeks, celery, green onions and fresh herbs. It was a large serving of mussels and the BF felt it was a fair deal. Unlike the French version he's had at other places, the broth in this dish was not at all enjoyable on its own.  For our dining companions, one friend ordered the Coquilles Ostendaise ($12) appetizer as his entree. I had this dish as my appetizer on my first visit and it looked good this time as well. But then again, how can you go wrong with scallops baked in a cheese bechamel? His BF ordered the Steak Au Poivre ($28). The filet mignon was served with a green peppercorn sauce and fries. The steak was petit for the grand $28 price tag.  Our meal took a real dive in terms of value with dessert. The BF and I shared the Mousse Au Chocolat ($6). As billed on the menu, it was a trio of white, milk and dark chocolate mousses. The surprising part was the portion size. Given that this dessert is basically chocolate pudding, it was a bit surprising for it to arrive in what was essentially a double shot glass. It was good, but not $6 good. Our friends decided to share the Tropezienne ($8). The menu claims that this dessert is French brioche pastry filled with creamy vanilla custard. I'll allow for some hyperbole in menu writing, but this dessert was anything but French pastry filled with custard. It was really a slice of flat vanilla cake that had been cut in half and filled with what tasted like vanilla pudding. Ironically, our friend who ordered this dish is a pastry chef and it goes without saying that he was not impressed with this dessert.  If only the decor was as fun and inviting as the restaurant website would lead you to believe. This place either ascribes to a minimalist aesthetic or there wasn't budget to make the space interesting. It has a lower mid-range European hotel feel.  The service was attentive.  However, that wasn't enough to off-set the over-priced menu.  It is interesting to have a Belgian restaurant in Phoenix. If only Chef Lionel would alter his menu to reflect the seasons and discount his prices so that they appear to be in US Dollars rather than in Euros. Then Trente-Cinq would be good to go. Hopefully these changes will occur before T-C shutters its doors for good.

Krave aspires to be an upscale gay club.  Their website claims the place can accommodate 1,500.  It probably fits more like 500, but there were nowhere near that many people there on the night we went, which was a Friday.  The $20 cover is ridiculous.  The go-go boys were terrible.  Hello?!  This is Las Vegas and they start 'em on the pole early around these parts!  You're better off to go to a regular club and have a good time.  This place is set up with private tables and cabanas all over the place, so the crowd is totally split up as a result.  Some crafty queens are trying to hoodwink the gay tourists with this tacky joint.  Save your pennies and go to South Beach if you want to experience the real deal.

The very best food has magical properties and one of the most remarkable is the ability to instantly transport you to another place and time.  Every time I dig into my first bite of gelato at Arlecchino Gelateria, I am transported back to Vivoli Gelato in Florence, Italy.  Make no mistake about it.  The gelato at Arlecchino is the real deal.  It's the same gelato you get in the very best artisanal gelaterias of Italy.  The fantastic gelato at Arlecchino is the work of Moreno Spangaro, a masterful small artisan producer who makes every batch from scratch.  It's no wonder that his product is so authentic.  Moreno hails from Trieste, Italy and he learned his craft by apprenticing for nearly two years with Fabio Sacchetto, his "maestro."     Moreno understand that a phenomenal product only results from the best and freshest ingredients.  He only uses fresh, organic fruits when they're in season and at their height of ripeness.  He relies heavily upon "McClendon's Select" for the best of the bounty that Arizona has to offer.  He doesn't overlook the non-fruit varieties either.  For example, he has his own mix of different chocolates because every one has different properties that result in a complex final chocolate flavor.  You MUST taste the gelato at Arlecchino to understand how fantastic it truly is.  They offer a limited selection of only the freshest flavors each day.  You may find classics such as Coffee, Nocciola, Pistacchio (made from 100% pure Sicilian pistachios from Bronte, Italy; it costs a few cents more per scoop and it's TOTALLY worth it!), Nutella, Stracciatella, and seasonal fruits.  The also offer original creations such as Cortina, which always reminds me of the charming Alpine village itself.  You're really in luck if they have the Peanut Butter or Dulce de Leche when you visit.  I just had the Valentino and it was complex and amazing because it's an infusion of pomegranate, berries, rose petals and lavender.    Moreno runs his tiny gelateria with his wife Marina.  You will often find one or both of them behind the counter.  Some might consider the decor of the shop to be a bit a minimalist, but no detail is overlooked at Arlecchino.  The shop is purposely simple and elegant to avoid any distraction from the beauty of the gelato itself.  The parking around Arlecchino can be a nightmare because it's next to La Grande Orange Grocery/Pizzeria and Postino is in the building behind it.  Don't despair and keep looking for a space because the gelato at this place is totally worth the extra effort.   If you want gelato, come to Arlecchino for an amazing experience.  Skip the other gelato joints in town because they're peddling pre-fab gelato bases and canned flavorings.

The BF and I make a weekly visit to LGO Pizzeria.  The tasty food here is consistent and reliable.  The atmosphere is hip and the staff is attractive with a very funky sense of style.  Craig is a great waiter and remembers all of our ordering quirks including the need for extra Splenda to go with our iced tea.  It's always a hoot to check out his new 'do for the week.  For appetizers, the BF loves to order a half dozen of their Chicken Wings ($7).  The wings are moist with a nice bit of char on them and a zesty wing sauce.  The housemade Point Reyes blue cheese dressing is a nice counterpoint to the slightly spicy wings.  I frequently order the Chopped Turkey salad ($8.25) with fresh greens, tomatoes, egg, avocado, bacon, Point Reyes blue cheese and cheddar tossed with both ranch and house vinaigrette.  This salad is technically only available at the LGO Grocery next door, but they will serve you one at the pizzeria if they have one on hand.  I have them dress the salad as usual with a combo of ranch and house vinaigrette, but then I get a side of the Point Reye blue cheese dressing as it's a tasty dip for the turkey and tomatoes.  Sometimes we go for the Shrimp Ceviche ($13) with avocado, tomatoes, jicama and lime juice with house-made tortilla chips.  If we're in the mood for pizza, we order the Gladiator ($14) with Schreiner's sausage and pepperoni, cheese blend and house-made red sauce.  We kick it up a notch and add black olives, broccolini, bacon and lemon zest.  Once in a while we go for broke and have them add a cracked egg to the mix.  I prefer a crisp crust, so I order the pizza "well done" to the point where the crust is almost burnt.  It's delicious and a decent stand-in for the ethereal pies at Pizzeria Bianco given that it does not require a wait of three or four hours.  Sometimes we mix it up and order the Fish Sandwich ($14) with house-made slaw.  It's best with fresh halibut.  I order a side of the Russian dressing to oomph up the sandwich.  And the fries they serve along with the sandwich are excellent.  We never order dessert here because we always grab it from the utterly superb Arlecchino Gelateria next door and bring it back to the table to enjoy.  The décor is pleasant with a huge vase in the center of the room that acts as an economic barometer.  The fresh flowers in the vase reach all the way to the ceiling when times are good and the arrangement gets shorter and shorter the worse the economy gets.  All in all, LGO Pizzeria is a great neighborhood yuppie pizza joint.

The BF and I are really into Tiki; we even host a Tacky Tiki Gay Pride Brunch.  It should come as no surprise that Trader Vic's is right up our alley.  Dining at this establishment even affords us the opportunity to rock some Hawaiian shirts from our collection.  The atmosphere at Trader Vic's is impeccable.  It's a swanky combo of island and Mid-century Modern design that fits in perfectly with the Hotel Valley Ho vibe.  This place is Tiki with a hefty dash of class.  The Tiki drinks are excellent and the bartenders pride themselves on mixing with scientific precision.  There's a wide variety of drinks with something for everyone. Note that the glassware is specific to each drink at Trader Vic's.  Try the Mai Tai as Trader Vic's claims to have the "real" version.  Whether or not it's the original, it's very good.  If you're accustomed to a sickly sweet Mai Tai, then this one will be a revelation.  None of the Tiki drinks at Trader Vic's fall into the sickly sweet category, thankfully.  I like the Bahia, which is a shaken (not blended) version of a Pina Colada.  The BF really likes the Gun Club Punch that comes served in a ceramic tumbler designed to look like an oversized shotgun shell.  It's a blend of silver and dark rum with pineapple and lime juices along with grenadine and curacao.  Sometimes the BF will also order the Fog Cutter with silver rum, brandy and gin.  The Trader Vic Sling is also very tasty.  It's a combination of gin, sloe gin, cherry liqueur, lime juice, creme de cassis and grenadine.  Be careful of enjoying too many libations as it's easy to become a Tiki Drink Drunk at Trader Vic's.  For appetizers (or pupus in Tiki speak), the sampler platter that includes Barbeque Spare Ribs, Crab Rangoon, Crispy Prawns and Cha Siu Pork (from the Chinese Wood Fired Oven that can be seen in its own glassed-in room near the kitchen) is great for sharing.  The last few times we've been they've had a Firecracker Shrimp special that makes a great pupu to split.  The shrimp are stir-fried with fresh pineapple, bell pepper and lots of spice.  The whole thing is served in half a pineapple.  For entrees, the Apple Wood Bacon Wrapped Jumbo Sea Scallops can be sublime, but the last time I had them they were a bit over-cooked.  The slaw that comes on the side with the scallops is delicious.  The Calcutta Chicken Curry is very tasty.  The restaurant makes a big deal out of presenting all the extras (e.g., coconut, raisins etc.) separately for you to mix in for yourself.  The dishes they use for this presentation are cool, but it's a bit superfluous.  The BF has enjoyed the Maple Leaf Duck Breast.  The Fried Rice is also delicious and the Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi-Mahi is also tasty.  The Panko Onion Rings make a nice side dish for sharing.  We normally don't save room for dessert.  We tried the dessert sampler once, but there was nothing outstanding on it.  Prepare to give your AMEX a workout at Trader Vic's because it's spendy.  However, it's worth it.  Trader Vic's serves impeccable drinks and refined Polynesian food in a delightful setting.  Eating at this establishment is like being swept away to the best of Honolulu.    Mahalo, Trader Vic!

If you're searching for foodie hidden treasure in Phoenix, turn your back on the strip malls. You need look no further than Quiessence, "A Garden to Table Experience." As the BF pointed out, "This is what Binkley's should aspire to be."  The philosophy of the restaurant centers around local and seasonal ingredients. Quiessence is a showcase for local growers such as McClendon's. The provenance of nearly every ingredient is noted with strong connections to Arizona. Chef Greg LaPrad's food is not only local, seasonal, sustainable and responsible, it's also delicious.  This is the kind of place that does Alice Waters proud.  Since Quiessence depends upon the best seasonal ingredients, the menu changes nightly. The BF and I had the six-course tasting menu. The portion sizes were perfect and the wine pairings were good.  Amuse Bouche:  As it should be, we were given a bite of apricot stuffed with local cheese and kissed by mint that left us wanting more.  Course 1: "The Chef's Spread," a tasting of housemade salumi, terrines and cheese. It's nice to know the Quiessence Charcuterie and Salumi program grew out of the desire to use every bit of the animals purchased for the restaurant. The accompanying housemade carrot, zucchini and yellow squash pickles were delightful.  Course 2: Chilled salad of cantaloupe, Armenian Cucumber, tomato and housemade croutons in a yogurt and dill dressing. It's rare that I call a salad course fabulous. The BF and I are going to shamelessly steal the idea and replicate it for our next dinner party.  Course 3: Housemade gnocchi with pork ragut. My family on both sides traces its roots back to Italy, so I am picky with Italian food. Sous chef Anthony Andiario's handmade cheese-infused gnocchi were spectacular and the ragout was perfect. The bowl had been properly warmed to keep the dish at temperature while I luxuriated in it. Our server initially forgot to bring us the wine for this course, but it arrived about halfway through.   Course 4: Fried soft shell crab with zucchini. Neither the BF nor I like soft shell crab. However, this version was so perfectly prepared that we both savored every bite. The zucchini in a savory sauce was a perfect contrast to the seafood.  Course 5: Pork tenderloin with bean and mustard "gruel." The pork was tasty and tender, but it was served fully pink in the center. We were fine with this, but some diners may not be as open-minded to rare pork. I liked the side dish, but the BF did not because it contained beans. The "gruel" was mondo ugly on the plate. Speaking of the plate, the tasting version came on a really awkward piece of china that curved up on one side to form a well for the gruel and then back down on the other side to create a small area for the pork slices. The plate felt crowded.  Up to this point, dinner was utterly sublime and Quiessence was on its way to a perfect five star rating.  But then, alas, a star was lost with dessert.  Course 6: Sampling of cheesecake, pink grapefruit sorbet and chocolate "torte" with peach ice cream. These were classic "chef's desserts;" a cook made them but not someone with pastry skills. Chef Greg, please get yourself a pastry chef. With the access that your restaurant has to the freshest ingredients, your desserts should be a revelation. The best item was the pink grapefruit sorbet. It was tangy and refreshing and would have made a great intermezzo. The citrus zest cheesecake was okay, but a bit dense. The peach ice cream was fine. The chocolate "torte," however, was an abomination. The BF theorizes the cake fell as it was grainy and lumpy. At first, I thought it was either supposed to be cheesecake or some sort of chocolate bread pudding. I confirmed with the server it was a "torte." I cannot believe the kitchen allowed that mess to be served and it went back virtually untouched. The sad part is that was our final impression of the restaurant. Dessert cannot be an afterthought or lazy. The wine for this course was tawny and it did not complement the citrus flavors.    Putting the huge disappointment of dessert course aside, Quiessence was wonderful. We'll be back as this place would be a perfect showcase for guests or a special occasion. Next time we'll try the Brick Oven Table. It's a magical table outside in its own little cabana wrapped with mini white lights. It features an improvisational $95 pp eight-course meal that the chef and sous chef prepare for two to six people.  Quiessence features a relaxed atmosphere. The interior is neutral and many of the decorative items appear to be from Marshall's. The environment is pleasant enough and does not distract from the food, which is the real star of the show.  Your AMEX had best be prepared for a workout. The tab for the BF and I came to just over $310 with tax and tip. That included the $75 pp six-course tasting menu and the $40 pp wine pairings.  Please note that Quiessence is closed for the month of July.

The BF and I shared the meal of our lives at Restaurant Guy Savoy in Paris on Valentine's Day 2006. It was also the most expensive meal of our lives with the MIDDLE priced tasting menu, two cocktails and a bottle and a half of moderately priced wine coming in at $1,800 (thanks in part to an unfavorable exchange rate). The meal was absolutely worth every dime and it was perfect in every way. Chef Savoy came by our table that night no less than four times to ensure we delighted.   Based on our exemplary experience in Paris, I was reticent to try Restaurant Guy Savoy in Las Vegas. I was afraid it would be a shadow of the flagship in the City of Lights. I was delighted to discover that Franck Savoy, Guy's absolutely adorable son, has done his father proud. Franck runs the Vegas restaurant with the same level of quality as in Paris.   If you've been to the restaurant in Paris, be prepared for a few differences in Las Vegas. The service is a bit Americanized. In Paris they just automatically pair the housemade bread with each course of your meal. In Las Vegas they pull up an admittedly impressive cart with 14 housemade breads and offer them to you or they give you the option for them to pair them with your dishes. I preferred the more subtle approach in Paris. However, I fear some of the subtleties of French service are lost on Vegas.   The other advantage is that you're paying in US dollars at the Las Vegas satellite. We took the BF's brother along with us on this trip to Vegas to celebrate his birthday. After enjoying the fabulous Better Midler show, we were just going to have drinks and appetizers in the bar. However, we glanced at the dinner menu and mentioned that we had been to the original in Paris and then Franck said, "Welcome home" and we were on our way to a table.   The Menu Prestige was priced at $290 per person and it was absolutely worth every penny given the quality of the food. The meal was comprised of:  * An initial bite from the kitchen of foie-gras and toast  * A dual amuse bouche of seasonal squash soup and a bite of pate -- note that the novel plate for this dish is made exclusively for Guy Savoy in Limoges; many of the Guy Savoy exclusives are designed specifically for the dishes being served  * Oysters in Ice Gelée -- this was good, but the decorative carrot slices (meant to resemble flower blossoms) under the gelee kept sticking to the roof of my mouth  * "Colors of Caviar" -- the decadent layers of this dish are a delight for the eyes and the tongue  * Crispy Sea Bass with Delicate Spices -- the preparation of this dish is elaborate as they cook the scales on a hot rock to make them edible while the flesh is separately cooked to perfection; the mushrooms on the side were wonderful as was the vanilla sauce  * Foie-Gras "en Papillotte" and Radish Bouillon -- the tableside presentation of this dish is something else; they bring it out in a pillow of clear plastic on a bed of hot rocks so that you can savor the aroma before they take it back to the kitchen and plate it for you  * Artichoke and Black Truffle Soup with Toasted Mushroom Brioche, and Black Truffle Butter -- there's nothing in the soup but artichokes and water, really.  * Since we had been to the flagship in Paris, they brought us a fantastic "bonus" course of white fish in a veal reduction (!) over perfectly crispy potato slivers; it was one of my favorite savory dishes of the meal  * Muscovy Duck "Poached-Roasted" with Autumn Root Vegetables -- and they've tucked some foie-gras under the duck skin, of course  * Sélection de Fromages Affinés -- the cheese cart is fabulous and the charming French lad who served the cheese to us was nearly seven feet tall; we asked him to put together a selection of the most interesting cheeses on the cart and they were all great  * We then enjoyed a palate cleanser of mango and avocado sorbets; they were perfectly sweet and provided another great transition point  * Textures of Blood Orange -- this was really blood oranges four ways; I love blood oranges, but it tasted sour to me. It needed a bit of sugar, especially after the sweet sorbets served right before it.  * Chocolate Sphere -- I thought this would be a heavy truffle and I was delighted to see what Chef Savoy had in mind. You need to experience Restaurant Guy Savoy for yourself to see what they do with this dessert  * Finally, they brought over the "treat cart." It contained delights I have been dreaming about since Paris. The highlights included:  * Cotton candy rice pudding (they call it "pink praline" -- it was very good, but it's ethereal in Paris)  * Housemade blood orange marshmallows; the marshmallows at Guy Savoy prove what a triumph this simple confection can be  * Macarons just like you'd savor in Paris  * Fruit gelees -- so simple and so perfect  * Lollipops that are a testament to the art of sugar   This restaurant is utterly amazing and it's worth the price. Merci, Franck!

I find it odd that a place with wasabi in its name served the BF and I multiple plates of sushi with nary a speck of wasabi in sight.   Maybe they ran out of the maligned blue food coloring the night we went in, but it was weird for the wasabi to go missing at a sushi restaurant.  Blue Wasabi's web site really dances around it, but the original location in DC Ranch has been shuttered.  They now have two outposts and a thing for "villages" (e.g., strip malls).  There is this location in Hilton Village and another in San Tan Village.   Unfortunately, Blue Wasabi was better at the original location.  The main advantage to the new digs is the increased size.  The original in DC Ranch was the size of the postage stamp and the upholstered back room was like something you would find in a condemned asylum.  The new space is much larger and a very efficient space planner managed to squeeze out every possible place to put a seat.  We were there on a fairly quiet Sunday night and it was fine, but with the communal table running down the center of the restaurant, this place is probably jam-packed on a busy night.  The wall of light that changes colors behind the sushi bar is cool.  The owners spent at least a few hundred grand on the interior build out.  The menu has been dumbed down in the new location.  It now offers a number of options clearly designed for folks who won't eat raw fish.  The bar food items include the Buddha Burgers, Macadamia Chicken Strips, and Filet Mignon Medallions.  Blue Wasabi needs to decide if it's going to be a sushi restaurant or a bar that serves food.      You've got to be open to modern sushi if you're going to enjoy Blue Wasabi.  If you're a sushi purist, this is definitely not the place for you.  The signature rolls are still irreverently named, but they don't have the outstanding flavors that were found at the original location.  I suspect the original sushi chef didn't make the move to Hilton Village.  It now feels like a second string chef is merely replicating what was once innovative.  The BF always enjoys the Eating Nemo Roll of krab (Blue Wasabi has fallen into the fake crab trap) and cucumbers topped with fresh salmon, thinly sliced lemons and ponzu sauce.  The Kiss My Bass Roll of shrimp tempura, cucumber and avocado topped with striped bass sashimi and ponzu dressing is also good.  In another riff on colors, the Marilyn Monroll is tuna, yellowtail, salmon, spicy tuna, krab (again!), avocado and cucumbers wrapped in pink soy paper.  Another different roll is the P.I.T.A. (Pain In The Ass) with tuna, krab, and avocado inside a cucumber wrap with a garlic ponzu dressing.  The Where's The Beef Tempura Roll is seared beef tenderloin, asparagus, avocado and shrimp that is then tempura'd and topped with a sweet soy glaze.  It was okay.  If you like sweet sushi, the Killer Bee Roll is a California roll topped with freshwater eel, sliced mango and a sweet soy glaze.   The Signature Martinis are also fun.  The BF usually goes for the Wango Mango (Stoli Peach vodka, mango nectar with an orange cranberry splash).  I always order the Mello Jell-O (Skyy Berry vodka, cranberry flavored sweet and sour and cran-raspberry juice infused with dark cherry Jell-O).  It's like a Jell-O shot martini and that's a tasty treat.  Anyone who dines out on sushi in the Valley will not be shocked that Blue Wasabi is expensive.  The BF and I never get out of this place for under $100 for the two of us.  There are a couple of promotions they run to help out the thrifty diner.  The first is Blue Sundays.  If anyone in your party wears blue on a Sunday, Blue Wasabi will give you 50% off alcoholic beverages.  Their drinks are spendy, so the discount is nice.  Somehow the BF and I end up ordering twice as many drinks on Blue Sundays, but we still feel like we're getting a deal.  The real deal is Frequent Diner Mondays.  The trick is to stop by Blue Wasabi and have a drink during the week or weekend and then return the following Monday with your validated receipt for 50% off all food.  Depending upon how much sushi you order, that's one good deal, honey.    The new Blue Wasabi is hip, fun and irreverent.  It's not as innovative as the original in DC Ranch and I'm not sure that the food and drinks are still worth what they cost.  It's best to try to catch this place on a promotional deal.

I have lived in the Valley of the Sun for nearly 13 years and I just found out about The Original Garcia's.    Serious props to a friend for mentioning it because this place is great.  The BF and I have been lacking a good regular Mexican joint (as opposed to the gourmet spin of Barrio Café) and The Original Garcia's will definitely be in our rotation going forward.  This place offers good food at a good value, which is just the thing during a recession.  The décor is fun without getting into the whole chain restaurant kitsch and this place is HUGE.  It's great for large groups.    The Appetizer Combination is a must.  The miniature items are tasty and oh so cute!  The chimichangas rock.  Oh to luxuriate in that crazy good sauce they use to enrobe the chimis!  The combo beef and chicken fajitas were tasty, too.  The fresh limes were a nice touch and the guacamole was tasty with a refreshingly ample portion.  We'll be back!  Some reviewers talk about his place being in the 'hood.  The neighborhood is marginal, but it's not like you have to dodge stray bullets in the parking lot.

This place is trying WAY too hard!   To establish my fine dining cred, I've eaten at world-class restaurants including The Restaurant Guy Savoy (best restaurant in the world, hands down) and Taillevent in Paris; Gordon Ramsay's Boxwood Cafe in London, Enoteca Pinchiorri in Florence; Cabaa Las Lilas in Buenos Aires; Charlie Trotter's, Topolobampo and TRU in Chicago; Daniel Boulud at the Ritz-Carlton and the Blue Door at the Delano in South Beach; Chez Panisse in Berkeley; Jardiniere and Fleur de Lys in San Francisco; Picasso Restaurant at Bellagio and Bradley Ogden at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas; Larry Forgione's An American Place in St. Louis; etc.  I know a thing or two about fine dining. So what went wrong? Binkley's does not have a firm grasp of the fundamentals of fine dining.  We drove from downtown Phoenix to the hinterlands of Cave Creek for what we hoped would be an exciting culinary experience. Since Binkley's is located in metro Phoenix, it was no surprise to find it in a strip mall. However, it was a bit of a surprise to see how derelict that strip mall was.  Once the BF and I began to peruse our menus, I started to notice omens. The first was that literally nothing on the menu sounded good to me. A couple of tables over, a server dropped a pitcher of water on a woman's lap and all over her cell phone. The restaurant did nothing to make amends to the poor woman who sat there trying to mop up her drenched outfit and rescue her mobile with the napkin in her lap.   We went for the full six-course tasting menu with the wine pairings and the BF added the Foie Gras. Then we received what we assumed would be the only amuse bouche of the night. Chef Kevin, please recall that an amuse bouche is a tiny bite-sized morsel traditionally served before the first course of a meal. At Binkley's, they're into amuse bouche a go-go. They serve them between each course and they get weirder and weirder. The final one was served on a pulsing LED coaster like the kind they use to buzz you for your table at a chain restaurant. The double shot glass on the pulsating coaster was meant to look like a lava lamp, but it reminded me of the ill-fated Orbitz soft drink that had edible balls floating in it. Drinking Orbitz was like having Willy Wonka do something naughty in your mouth and the Binkley's version was no better.      The food ranged from atrocious to merely passable. My first course was a "salad" of a couple of specks of hearts of palm and a few morsels of dates strewn across my plate without dressing. The waiter made a huge deal out of my not finishing the course and this would repeat every time he came to take a plate away as the food never improved. He would then take my plates into the display kitchen so that Chef Kevin could see I was not eating most of his food and he would ask the waiter why. I could hear and see all of this. The staff and the chef made me feel extremely uncomfortable about not liking their aspirational food.  Then the guy with the bread appeared. It was like they hired the Hunchback of Notre Dame to schlep bread from table to table. I wasn't expecting a model, but this guy looked like he was in a work-release program. Watching him limp to the table and speak through his snaggle teeth was too much.  I was not the only diner made to feel bad. The same gal who had the water spilled on her earlier informed the waiter that she wanted to cancel the desserts for her table. The Front of House Manager intervened and said he would have to talk to the kitchen.  He came back and guilted them into getting their unwanted desserts because the kitchen had already fired them. Mr. Dense could not seem to grasp that the poor woman just wanted to end her dining ordeal. As soon as the woman said she wanted to cancel the desserts, they should have been thrown into the garbage. As the evening progressed, more and more tables tried to cancel their desserts because the meals were so drawn out. Every time, they were either guilted into waiting for the unwanted desserts at their tables or having them packed in uber-elaborate doggie bags.  By the time our disappointing desserts arrived, I was just glad to be at the end of this mediocrity marathon.    The final tab for this cluster?  Just shy of $500 for two. If Binkley's was in a metro area with true fine dining like L.A or San Francisco, this place would already be shuttered.   So we left and I assumed we could put this whole terrible experience behind us. A few days later my phone rang and it was Binkley's calling. I was informed that the Chef noticed that I had issues with the food (implying that I just didn't appreciate his faux haute cuisine).  I declined to book another reservation (on my own dime).      My advice for a romantic dinner? Skip this train wreck and enjoy a superb dinner at T. Cook's at The Royal Palms. It won't be true fine dining, but you will avoid the abomination that is Binkley's.

For what it cost, Sushi Roku was just okay.  Lunch for three of us ran nearly $250 (with no alcohol).  We ordered the mixed tempura, three of the signature rolls and three of the sashimi choices.  With just one sashimi selection costing nearly $40 and signature rolls hovering at $30 each, it didn't take long to run up the tab.  The sushi rolls fell apart way too easily.  The rice didn't have the right texture and there's no excuse for that at these prices.  The service was also spotty.  Again, not cool at these prices.  The decor is fine, but I am sure this place benefits from candlelight.  It was a bit dark and spare in the afternoon for lunch.  It also smelled like fish.  A sushi place that is this spendy shouldn't smell like fish.  Frankly, I think you can get better sushi for the money in Vegas.

This high-end chocolate shop is based off of the original in Chicago.  Vosges is famous for mixing chocolate with spices and you should take the opportunity to taste some of their chocolates.  By far, the very best item in the line is the Peanut Butter Bonbons.  They're incredible and worth $27 for nine bite-size pieces.  The packaging here is also really interesting.    Be sure to check out the truffles that combine cheese and chocolate.  Yes, you read that right.  The Rooster is a combination of Taleggio cheese, organic walnuts, Tahitian vanilla bean and bittersweet dark chocolate.  It's a crazy combination, but it works.  The look of the shop is really cool.  The white circular mini tiles at the base of the counter remind me of the Paris Charles de Gaulle airport.

I absolutely cannot stand Mario Batali. He bugs about the same as Bobby Flay, but not as much as Rocco DiSpirito. The BF and I were in Las Vegas for the BF's brother's birthday and we needed a place for lunch. We decided on Enoteca San Marco before I realized it was a Mario Batali place. As we walked in, I saw an autographed pair of Batali's trademark day-glo orange Crocs ON THE FOOD COUNTER. The Crocs were obviously too small to support Batali's rotund frame, but it was gross to see shoes on the food counter. Given the amount of Asian business that Vegas gets these days, Batali should be aware that putting shoes on the food prep counter is a tremendous offense in Japan. Bobby Flay found that out on Iron Chef.   Anyway, the food is okay. It's a small plates concept and you'll spend $30 - $60 per person for lunch before you get enough to eat. This is nothing like eating in Italy, but it's passable. The gelato was good and they had interesting flavors like blood orange and grapefruit.   The faux Venetian atmosphere adds a bit, but it is quickly offset by the "free" singing that occurs hourly. You get to endure costumed shrieking for up to 20 minutes each hour. It really detracts from the dining experience and heightens the fakery of the setting.   There are better places to go, but if you're trapped in the shopping mall attached to the Venetian, this place is an okay choice.

You've got to hand it to Candace Nelson; she knows how to bake up palpable buzz.  You need look no further than the perpetual line at Sprinkles Cupcakes in Scottsdale.  If only the cupcakes were as good as the hype.  Unfortunately, they are not.  It comes down to style over substance.  Sprinkles Cupcakes has a great look from the windows frosted with the outlines of cupcake wrappers to the spare wood display racks.  The aesthetic is clean, modern and restrained.   The cupcakes are impeccable in terms of their appearance.  The bakery even offers an interlocking cardboard stand with optional ribbon trim to create a display for a special event.  The graphics and design are top-notch.    While we may eat with our eyes first, the disappointment creeps in once you move beyond the visual and taste the cupcakes.  At best, they're okay.  In order to give Sprinkles a fair shake, I pre-ordered a dozen online.  Anyone can order a minimum of a dozen cupcakes online with 24 hours advance notice.  The real advantage of the pre-order is that you get to skip the mayhem of the line.  It's worth it to walk right up to the counter and pick up your prepaid order without having to stand in the chaotic line and watch the crowd's tension level rise as they run out of flavor after flavor.    As a home baker who makes everything from scratch, I found Sprinkles Cupcakes to be resoundingly underwhelming.  Their signature Red Velvet Cake was a real disappointment.  The cake itself was bitter and sour at the same time.  It also had an unpleasant lingering aftertaste.  Actually, all of the cupcakes I tried with chocolate cake had the same bitter and sour taste combined with the lingering unpleasant aftertaste.  It was almost like the chocolate cakes weren't mixed properly before they were baked.  If it has been one or two cupcakes, I would have given them the benefit of the doubt; however, this place takes the concept of bittersweet chocolate to a new and very strange level.  The Carrot cupcake is also misnamed; it should be called a Spice cupcake instead because the presence of any carrot is nearly undetectable.  In fairness, the Coconut cupcake was the best of the 12 sampled.  The taste of both the cake and the icing was great; the cake itself was a bit stiff and dry (but less than the others sampled).    In terms of texture, the 12 cupcakes sampled varied from "sturdy" (e.g., nothing close to tender) to dry and crumbling apart.  This is definitely not what I expect from a premium bakery.  Some other reviewers have commented that the cupcakes are too expensive.  Clearly they haven't been to a grocery store lately to check on the price of butter, eggs, sugar, cream, cream cheese, etc.  The cupcakes are fairly priced for the premium ingredients that Sprinkles uses.  However, those ingredients are not falling into the most adept hands.  Perhaps this is an issue with a newly trained staff.    For the money and the pleasure of the experience, enjoy an Ooey Gooey from Tammie Coe instead of Sprinkles.  Tammie's cupcakes are the real deal and are everything that Sprinkles aspires to be.  Just be sure to allow Tammie's cupcakes to return to room temperature before you devour them.  They're sublime while the cupcakes at Sprinkles are serviceable at best.  Sprinkles Cupcakes was worth trying once to see what all the hype was about.  However, I won't be back.

The name "Palatte" is purportedly a combination of "palate" and "palette."  Sadly, I found nothing pleasing to my palate here and any aspirations of artistry are just that.  I had heard good things about this place and I brought the BF here one afternoon to give it a try.  We won't be back.  My guess is that Palatte is the first restaurant that Christine and Edward McHale have run.  This operation is amateurish and in desperate need of a good short order cook.  Perhaps the owners can poach one from Matt's Big Breakfast.    Let's start with the whole "service" concept.  We showed up toward the end of lunch and there were several staff members lurking about.  We kept looking for a host stand and the staff saw us obviously trying to figure out what to do, but no one offered to give us any guidance.  Finally, we made our way into the house and the BF figured out that we had to order at the counter.  Palatte has decided to go with the lazy approach of making customers order at a counter and schlep a numbered marker to a table for the "server" to find later for food delivery.  We decided to start off with a pineapple upside down muffin.  It turned out to be bland and dry.  Since Palatte desperately tries to lean toward the French, they should mix in some "sucre" so that their baked goods actually have some taste.  The BF and I decided to split the sweet potato pancakes after hearing so much about them.  The menu proclaims that the pancakes combine sweet potatoes with mascarpone cheese, pecans and maple syrup. The end result is an abomination.  The pancakes must have been seriously over-mixed as they were absolutely rubbery and yet tasteless.  When a restaurant's signature dish is this bad, things can only go downhill.  I ordered The Potato "Mish-Mash," which is really a $9 plate of scrambled eggs with potatoes, bacon, spinach, onion, Gouda and Monterrey Jack.  It was okay, but the portion was tres, tres petit.  The Breakfast Potatoes on the side were a disgrace.  They were par-boiled potatoes that had been sitting around for hours.  I know because I saw a huge pile of them in the kitchen when we placed our order at the counter.  The kitchen barely warmed them before plunking them on my plate.  They weren't even showing the faintest hint of brown.  Sacrebleu!  If you want real breakfast potatoes, go for the hash browns at Matt's Big Breakfast where you can get a decent breakfast in downtown.  But back to les pommes de terre aux Palatte; they're served with creme fraiche for dipping.  When Edward brought my plate to the table, I asked for a side of ketchup.  Edward directed me to try the creme fraiche first before he would bring me the ketchup.  Here's the deal, Ed.  I've eaten in some of the finest restaurants in the world.  I don't need to be coerced into trying your creme fraiche and it actually works better on the scrambled eggs.  I asked for the ketchup to try to mask the taste of your pathetic potatoes.  A faux French vibe permeates Palatte.  This place looks like what Sage Antiques might look like if robbers broke in during the middle of the night and cleared out everything of value or perhaps a vintage southern home after the estate sale.  What's with the pile of old barrel drums in the corner of the yard?  For over $40 for two, we could have gone to a Arcadia Farms for a delightful brunch.  Bonne chance, Palatte.  You're going to need it!

I've been fortunate enough to travel to Thailand twice.  It's a beguiling place.  The most remarkable thing about Thailand is the friendliness of its people.  Everyone smiles in Thailand, regardless of how humble their circumstances may be.  Thai Hut is a sheer delight because it reminds me of the best of Thailand.  The staff at this restaurant is always smiling and their happiness is infectious.    The setting for the restaurant has a fun and funky vibe.  It looks like Flo's Diner was redecorated by Thom Filicia with decor from the Suan Lum Night Bazzar in Bangkok and a Mid-century Modern reproduction house.  The choice of location on McDowell across from the Phoenix Art Museum is great.    Whether or not the food at Thai Hut is authentic is a moot point.  In Thailand I tasted a wide variety of even the most basic dishes such as Tom Kha Kai soup and Larb.  It all depended on the chef and their given preparations and quirks.  What sets the food in Thailand apart from what you will generally find in the US is the level of spice.  The food in Thailand varies in heat intensity from Nuclear Hot to Surface of the Sun Hot.  I've seen Thai folks enthusiastically devour Tom Yum soup that was so hot it made them weep.  I've also tasted a dish spiced with pepper-infused vinegar that was so hot it literally took my breath away along with some taste buds.     With all that said, the food at Thai Hut is great with an appropriate amount of spice for the average Phoenician's palate.  My favorite soup is Tom Kha Kai and the Thai Hut version is luscious due to all the silky coconut milk they use.  It makes a great start to a meal.  The standby Sa-Tay appetizer is delicious as the chicken is spiced with curry before grilling and the peanut sauce is delightfully sweet.  I believe the sauce is enriched with coconut milk.  The Fresh Rolls are also very tasty, but the BF does not like that they include large pieces of green onion in them.  He pulls out the green onion pieces before enjoying his Fresh Rolls and all is good again for us at Thai Hut.  Thai Hut offers a variety of entrees and all have proven to be tasty.  The Cashew Nut dish offers up a mix of sauteed cashews, onions, green peppers and your choice of protein in a savory sauce.  The sauce balances well with the cashews and it brings out their natural sweetness.  The Pineapple Fried Rice is a delicious choice that includes lovely chunks of fresh pineapple and cashews.  The Ultimate Asparagus dish comes from the Chef's Special section of the menu.  It offers fresh asparagus stir-fried with shrimp and chicken in a savory brown garlic sauce.  I totally understand why it's in the Chef's Special section as it's delightful.    The Thai Iced Tea is also appropriately sweet and the milk is a nice respite from the spice in the dishes.  Thai Hut also offers its menu at a very wallet-friendly price point.  I used to enjoy Wild Thaiger, but it has become too expensive for what it is.  Thai Hut offers better food at about half the price.  Thai Hut has knocked Wild Thaiger off as my standard Thai restaurant.  Thai Hut offers take out and we placed a large order of Sa-Tay and Fresh Rolls for our Tacky Tiki Gay Pride Brunch and the proprietors were very accommodating.

It's interesting to watch a restaurant like Roka Akor evolve.  The BF and I have eaten here four times since it opened last summer.  The food has always been exceptional and the décor is stunning in its simplicity.  It's no surprise this restaurant is linked to one in London.  The minimalist décor is reminiscent of the simplicity of Ozumo in San Francisco.  It's worth a visit just to sit in the serene setting and enjoy its aesthetic perfection.  "Bon Appetit" magazine named Roka Akor one of the 10 best places for sushi in the US in its April 2009 edition.    The good news is that the pricing has been adjusted to better align with the current economic situation.  Don't get me wrong.  Roka Akor is still spendy.  Dinner for three ran over $300.  The great news is that they now run a happy hour special every day from 3:30 to 6:30 and again from 9:00 to close.  You have to sit in the bar or on the patio, but they offer half price apps and drinks.  The BF and I are stoked because this means we can frequent this place without having to justify the expense.  The Salmon Avocado Roll is a steal for $5.  The Roka Akor Burgers looked awesome and they are just $1.  As far as the drinks go, this place specializes in shochu infusions.  The Hani-P'ru is an amazing combo of honey comb shochu and fresh pineapple.  They go down WAY too easy and they've even better during happy hour at $6 vs. $12 on the dinner menu; especially when you have three.  Yum!  Our most recent meal was superb.  The food was literally pitch perfect.  The Butternut Squash with Japanese Pepper Broth ($8) was excellent.  Ask them to make the pepper broth spicy like they used.  The spice creates a perfect balance with the fried squash.  Also, don't let this dish linger on the table as the fried pieces can get soggy if you leave them in the broth too long.  The Seasonal Vegetables and Seafood ($15) tempura offered up three delicious prawns as the stars of this dish.  The 3 Sashimi Chef's Selection ($17.50) offered two pieces each of salmon, yellowtail and big eye tuna.  The sashimi was utterly perfect, but don't believe the menu when it classifies this dish as a "large" sashimi plate.  We had to order two of them for the three of us.  For sushi, we selected the Salmon Avocado Roll ($12) and the Crispy Prawn Roll ($12) and both were excellent.  We then moved on to items from the Robata grill, which is the main feature of the display kitchen.  The 8 oz. Grilled Prime Beef Fillet with Chili Ginger Sauce ($28) was utterly fantastic and I could have had just this dish as my entire meal.  It was superb, beefy perfection!  We added some of the robata grilled skewers and I really like that the restaurant now offers these by the piece so you can mix and match your sides.  We had the Sweet Potato with Ginger Teriyaki and Sesame skewers ($2.50 each), the Cremini Mushrooms with Garlic and Butter skewers ($2 each) and the Sweet Corn with Butter and Soy skewers ($2 each).  The corn skewers were delightful with just the right char on the niblets.  We decided to try a dessert since they wisely re-vamped this part of the menu.  Previously, the desserts were fairly dreadful in the traditional Asian dessert way, but that has been thankfully addressed.  We tried the Warm Toffee Cake with Peanut Butter Ice Cream and Caramelized Peanuts ($12).  The peanut butter ice cream was amazing and actually tasted like peanut butter with a super silky texture.  The caramelized peanuts were also excellent and had great crunch.  The one area that needs work in the toffee cake.  All three of us noticed it was a bit grainy and gritty.  When I mentioned this to our waiter, he went to the kitchen and came back to the table to tell us it was made with almond flour and chunky peanut butter.  I suggested they work on the texture as the taste of the dish was spot on.  The service is also superb at Roka Akor.  Our waiter has served us three times now and he is attentive and helpful without being intrusive.  He is excellent at helping to navigate the menu and his recommendations are utterly reliable.  When I spilled some soy sauce on my silk shirt he immediate appeared at the table with a wash cloth that had been soaked in club soda for me.  That's service worthy of 20% tip on a $300+ check.  Roka Akor has hit its stride for sure.  Try this place and hit the happy hour to appeal to the recessionista in you.

Bette Midler is an entertainer in every sense of the word. She sings, she dances, she acts, she tells bawdy jokes and all this at the tender age of 63.   This is an old school Vegas show and it radiates class. It's worth every dime to see a performer of this caliber in person. Bette sings for nearly 100 minutes during this show.   See this show while you can and spring for seats on the floor so that you can truly enjoy it. But skip the $130 souvenir t-shirt.   The showgirl must go on, indeed!

A couple of dear friends told the BF and me that Icepics has a great show tune happy hour on Sunday afternoons.  It was a Friday evening and we had started off with happy hour at Amsterdam, so they suggested we move the party over to Icepics to check it out.  There were about 12 guys in the bar and they descended upon the eight of us like we were the fresh meat in a prison cell.  To say that the crowd was overly friendly would be a complete understatement.    The decor is pretty much non-existent and this place is way too brightly lit.  Frankly, some soft lighting would do the Icepics crowd a world of good.  I suppose the cheap drinks provide some "beer goggles."    We stayed for one drink and got out of there because we weren't looking for such an aggressive/creepy crowd.  One trip may have been enough for me to this dive.

While I am giving this restaurant four stars, I must start off by noting that the pizza here is mediocre.  If you want spectacular pizza in Phoenix, don't kid yourself that it's at I-17 and Thomas.  It's over at Pizzeria Bianco.  However, the other items on the dinner menu are worthy of a visit to the 'hood.   The Penne alla Vodka ($12.95) offers up pasta in tomato sauce with bacon, fresh basil cream and vodka.  It is an excellent starter to split with a dining companion and that's exactly what the BF and I do every time we visit this place.  The Cozze Posolipo mussels in garlic white wine sauce ($11.95) are also quite tasty as an appetizer.  The complimentary warm pizza dough they serve with an onion and olive topping is a nice touch.  For entrees, the Pollo Parmigiana ($14.95) is the classic breaded chicken breast with marinara, mozzarella and parmesan cheese served with penne.  The Lasagna della Casa with Bolognese sauce ($13.95) is very good, but the portion is a bit stingy for the price.  The BF often enjoys the Gamberi alla Pana ($15.95) that includes jumbo shrimp sautéed with mushrooms in a brandy cream sauce over a bed of fettuccine.  Please note that the brandy cream sauce is extremely rich.  Another tasty option is the Spaghetti con Salsiccia ($13.95) with mushrooms, bell peppers, onions and Italian sausage in marinara sauce with a touch of white wine.  The Cheese Ravioli ($13.95) is another great choice with the tomato cream sauce.  For dessert, be sure to order a Cannoli Siciliani ($5.95) as it's the very best I have had in Phoenix.  The Tiramisu ($5.95) is good as well.  The bad news is that this place is no longer BYOB.  For whatever reason, the management decided that a restaurant that seats no more than 20 needed a full liquor license.  I really hope that the investment in that spendy license doesn't lead to the undoing of this place.  Given that they don't even have a bar area and I almost never see anyone order a mixed drink, I think staying BYOB might have been a better choice for this neighborhood joint.  The service at this place is also part of the show.  The waiter may well be manic as he will either be way up or way down for your visit.  The décor here is pleasant enough given the location of this tiny restaurant in a modest strip mall.  If you happen to need a trip to the restroom, you will get the chance to traipse through the kitchen.  All in all, Pizza A Metro is ironically a great option for everything but pizza.

Afida's Hair Culture is the coolest salon in downtown Phoenix.  From the purple velvet drapes to the vintage vinyl chairs in the reception area, Afida's feels more like a funky gathering place than a salon.    Afida has been cutting hair for over 35 years and she trained in England at the Vidal Sassoon Academy.  She's been cutting my hair for going on 10 years and soon she will have been cutting the BF's hair for a year.  Afida does an amazing job with hair for both men and women.  I am consistently pleased with how well her haircuts grow out.  Anyone with scissors can make a haircut look okay on day one.  The true test is time and up to a month out from a haircut, Afida's always look great.  She also works wonders with color and she can transform another stylists "hair-don't" into a fabulous "hair-DO!"  The vibe of her salon is cool and retro.  It doubles as an art gallery and she participates in the First Friday Art Walk program.  Stop by and check out her art exhibits as they change each month.  Her husband Tony also DJs out in front of the shop on First Fridays.  This is a hip, authentic local spot.

Metro Brasserie offers the best value for your French dining dollar in town.  Compared to Vincent on Camelback, Christopher's, Zinc Bistro, Coup des Tartes and Sophie's French Bistro, Metro Brasserie is THE go-to French restaurant in Phoenix.  Metro Brasserie fills a HUGE void in this town by offering delicious French food at a reasonable price.    I really want to give this restaurant five stars but I just can't.  The problem is the menu.  It needs a re-write.  The descriptions are simplified to the point that the menu does not clearly set a diner's expectations.  The prime example was the dish my BF ordered.  The menu described it as "Poulet Rouge:  roasted chicken, Carolina-Gold rice, vegetables" ($17).  From the description, I envisioned roasted chicken on a pile of plain rice with a veggie medley.  When I asked our waiter, he clarified that the rice is actually a risotto and they take the meat from the wing and the thigh and blend it into the risotto.  The chicken breast is cooked and rolled in the crispy skin.  Hello?  That's nowhere near what I expected from the menu.  The two women seated near us who were conversing in French called the waiter over after they received their food.  The woman who ordered the chicken had to ask the waiter if she received the correct dish as she didn't recognize it.  The way the chicken breast is rolled and the skin is crisped, when the kitchen slices it into medallions to place on top of the risotto, it looks more like bacon-wrapped scallops.  It's fine to under-promise and over-deliver, but this menu is a clunker and it gets in the way of the excellent food.   We started off with the Fried Green Tomatoes ($11).  When the menu mentioned that they would be served with blue crab, I figured there would be a speck or two on the plate.  I was delightfully surprised when the tomatoes arrived absolutely covered in huge chunks of crab.  This is a generous amount of crab and the combination of the warm, crunchy tomatoes with the cool crab and the sauce remoulade was perfectly balanced.    The doughy texture of the bread reminded me of the bread sticks at the Olive Garden with a harder crust.  They were good and the warm bread was nicely complimented with herbed butter.  However, I expect mini baguettes to offer up the traditional symphony of crunch that sets them apart.   Both of us ordered the Frisee au Lardons ($9).  I expected the salad to be frisee tossed with a warm bacon dressing served with lardons (bacon cubes), a poached egg and a crouton.  The menu mentioned a Creole mustard dressing, but I didn't expect the salad to be served cold.  When I asked the waiter about it, he said he would talk to kitchen because it was supposed to be warm.  On his second stop by the table after I brought it up, I finally told the waiter that the fact the salad was served on an ice cold plate (which would have been a good thing if the salad was supposed to be cold), likely contributed to cooling off the dressing.  However, the frisee showed no wilting at all so I don't believe it was ever heated.  The menu description needs to be tweaked.  I would not order this salad again given the cold dressing and I feel like the menu should have told me that.  Maybe a lot of folks who dine here aren't familiar enough with French food to have expectations for classic dishes like this, but the menu should disclose when they're monkeying around with a standard.  I had the Brasserie Burger ($12) and it was utter perfection.  This is bad news for Delux as the burger here is flat-out amazing.  Order it.  You will not be disappointed.  It's the best burger in town.  I splashed out the extra $2 for the Pommes Frites.  They were delicious and serving them in a paper-lined mini metal bucket is genius because it keeps them warm.    The BF had the aforementioned Poulet Rouge.  He's not the type of guy to order chicken in a restaurant, but both of us agreed we would order this dish again.  The breast meat was perfectly moist and the skin that was crisped around it was utterly delectable.  The one change this dish needs is more aggressive seasoning of the risotto.  Otherwise, this is fantastic and a screaming deal for $17.    To round out the meal, we had the Sticky Toffee Pudding ($7) and it was excellent.  The warm cake was a nice contrast to the pistachio gelato.  The ice cream arrived a bit melty on the plate, but the flavor combination was spot on.  The crème fraiche was a really nice counterpoint to the sweetness.  Check out the crazy restrooms!  Like Christopher's, they are awfully spacious...   After enjoying a fantastic meal at Metro Brasserie, I am surprised that I didn't catch on that the concept of this restaurant is "French country meets the American South" until I read it on their web site.  True, the fried green tomatoes should have been a huge clue, but it didn't come across via the décor or the menu.     Metro Brasserie is our new go-to French restaurant.  We will be back!

This place offers up hip Chinese goods with a fresh spin.  The merchandise is cool, especially the cuff links and the wine accessories.  It's worth checking out on your next trip to Las Vegas.  The clothes may be a bit limited in their wearability given their pronounced Asian styling.  The store manager also seemed very eager to make a sale.

Arcadia Farms reminds me of Lifetime: TV for Women (and gay men).  On any given Saturday afternoon, it's fun to place bets on how many bridal and baby showers will be going on simultaneously.  This place puts out a siren song for the ladies who lunch.  As a result, the people watching is top-notch.  It's often like having an episode of "The Real Housewives of North Scottsdale/Paradise Valley" unfold at the table next to you.  Arcadia Farms is like a shrine to estrogen and it's rare for the BF and me to see more than another man or two in the place, but we don't mind.  The floor show is free, after all.  And if you want the valet to park your car in front of the restaurant, be sure to bring the Bentley.  The decor is one step removed from shabby chic.  It's feminine, but they got rid of most of the frills a few years back.  If the weather is accommodating, the back patio is the place to be.  It's really a lovely setting under the trees.  The small building at the back of the restaurant is usually reserved for the aforementioned bridal and baby showers.    The food at Arcadia Farms is very good.  Don't go expecting gourmet dishes; it's important to remember that at its heart Arcadia Farms is a catering company.  Actually, the BF and I have Arcadia Farms cater our annual holiday party and they do a fantastic job.    For appetizers, the Savory Smoked Salmon Cheesecake is delicious.  The portion used to be way too huge, but now it's been scaled back to a very manageable size as a starter for at least two people to share.  The Crab and Avocado Tower is also a good option, but the tower invariably collapses before it arrives at the table.  The BF and I usually start off by splitting an entree, the Wild Mushroom, Spinach and Goat Cheese Tart.  It is packed with cheesy goodness and comes with a side salad that creates nice contrast.  It splits into a hearty appetizer.  It was a dark day when spinach was pulled from the market and Arcadia Farms couldn't make this tart.  Thankfully, all is right with the world again.  For entrees, the Strawberry Chicken Salad is a classic for good reason.  Where Arcadia Farms manages to find such ripe strawberries year-round remains a mystery to me.  The Oriental Chicken Salad is also delicious.  Whenever I order this dish, I go for the gusto and request an extra side of the peanut sauce as the chicken pieces are luscious when dipped directly into the peanut sauce.  The California Club is a solid sandwich choice.  For me, the focaccia bread is too thick, but you can ask them to substitute another bread.  For something more substantial (and sinful), go for the Chicken, Wild Mushroom and Leek Crepes.  They're fantastic.  This dish also splits well.  Everything on the Arcadia Farms menu is fresh and tasty.  The challenge will be deciding what to order on a given day.  Ask if they have specials as they can be good.  On a recent visit the server went through a very lengthy description of a special salad and then she casually mentioned that they had already run out of it.  The BF and I found that rather amusing.  The signature Arcadia Farms beverage is apricot iced tea and it's quite flavorful.  The one nit is that they don't serve the tea with a straw or an iced tea spoon.  There are no spoons at the table and it's hard to catch your server's attention because they're busy moving from table to table.  So you are forced to stir your iced tea with the blade of your table knife.  The BF and I have talked about this several times while dining at Arcadia Farms and I think one of the servers overheard us the last time because they finally brought our iced tea with spoons.  Perhaps that will be a permanent change as it would certainly be welcome.  Beer and wine are also offered, with the expected restaurant markup.    In terms of pricing, you get a good amount of food for the price.  For a fancy brunch/lunch spot, the pricing is fair.  This place isn't in the cheap eats category, but you could get out of here for $20 per person if you only had a salad or sandwich.  But what's the fun in that?  The desserts at Arcadia Farms are pretty good, but the BF and I never have room for them.  The carrot "baby cake" is tasty, but it's big enough that you will need to split it with at least one other person.  Arcadia Farms also offers private luncheons and afternoon tea.  This is really an ideal spot for a bridal or baby shower.
