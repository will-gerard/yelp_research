Can I give a negative 5? Took my $350 down comforter to be laundered on Tuesday and was told to come back Friday at 4pm. My boyfriend picked up our order and once he brought it home, it WASNT MY DOWN CONFORTER but a cheap polyester quilt.. Went back and the lady at the front gave me another down comforter that was DRYCLEANED.. We thought it MIGHT look like ours and as of late Saturday found a picture of OUR beautiful down comforter and confirmed this horrible thing they gave back to us was in fact NOT OURS.  Update: it's been over a week and they still have not found my comforter. I brought back the second wrong one they gave me. I am disabled and spend most of my time in bed. With an approaching surgery I was hoping to have my comforter back. Guess I'll be sleeping on sheets. The manager gave me NO time line to correcting this issue.  I hate leaving bad reviews, but I don't understand how a business can not make a horrible,costly mistake without making it right.

Dr.Miller is one of the best physical Therapists I have ever met. I am deeply saddened that I can no longer have him as my PT. I have a rare genetic disorder called EDS that makes my joints fall out of place. It's horrific and Dr.Miller made it bearable.  However, his office staff made it unbearable to continue going to his office for treatment.  EVERYTHING is about insurance, how you'll pay, billing codes, ect. Which is like any other place.. But no. This place is a tangled web of figuring out how to best profit from your condition and if you don't fit into their codes. You're out of luck.  I am fully disabled and have on top of everything also have severe issues cognitively with executive function. The hoops that this place makes you jump through for an appointment is brutal, unnecessary and a panic attack waiting to happen.   I was barked at for a "no show" because I had a seizure the day of and was encouraged not to come back because I didn't show for his busy hour and "we need to make money."  There is no empathy.   I have a systemic illness and was told that under NO circumstances will they be able to work on more than one body part (even with scripts). This is to help track progress. What happens when you're not expected to make progress because of a disease that slowly robs you of mobility? You're still considered to make the same strides as everyone else.   The final straw.. I made appointments with them and had to get a script. Obtained it Friday and was charged $70.00 for no-show BEFORE my appointment for not having my script to them earlier.  I can't even get out of bed most days, I rely heavily on my doctors to get scripts, however he was out of town and didn't fax it, but gave me a hard copy..  The fact that I had the script in hand prior to the appointment was not enough and was charged $70 made me realize that patients aren't their main priority.    This is my entire month of money I had for food as I await disability.  if you're looking for a place that will work with you and your CHRONIC condition.. Save yourself the headache and stress and don't come here. They don't want anything complicated and they let you know it upfront.  I love Dr.Miller and am glad I had the chance to work with him for the time I did. Im sad that paperwork, billing,insurance and profit come before anything else in the practice.

This is a local, family owned jewel! The customer service is wonderful and the restaurant is cozy. Our family does take out at least a few times a month. It may look expensive from just looking on the menu, but the portions are gigantic! My favorite part is the fact that I can make it into a couple dinners.. With my gluten free diet it's hard to find delicious authentic food.The chicken kabobs with rice is always cooked to perfection. The special yogurt sauce is to die for and I always make sure I ask for extra. Thanks for all the delicious lunches/dinners and friendly service!!

I've been visiting this place for years. I stopped once I ate some bad tuna and swore off sushi for at least a year after.   It's overpriced, not fresh and I plan on never returning.   Save some $$ and maybe a night of dry heaves and check out the sushi restaurant across the street.   If you're looking for a flashy, overpriced place with great ambiance, this is for you.

I first discovered these delicious tamales at the Farmers Market on Cactus and the 51.    After trying the Chicken and Green Chili tamale, I was hooked. I now regularly buy tamales each week when I'm at the farmers market.     The chicken chipotle is hands down my favorite tamale they make! Perfect amount of spice and is great when you top it with goat cheese.    These tamales are a taste of heaven! Not to mention guilt & gluten free!

I've been going to Thai House about once a month for the past year. I'm so glad I found this jewel. The food is consistently scrumptious and I haven't had anything I dislike.  I'm gluten free and the Green Curry with chicken or tofu is delicious. The Jasmine rice is to die for. It's fluffy, has a hint of sweetness to it and enhances the already delicious curry.  This Thai house is perfect for a date, family meal or a quick pickup. I like the atmosphere and the aroma of fresh, authentic Thai food that greets you in the restaurant.   I'm a foodie and have visited a handful of Thai places around the valley and this place takes the win!

My favorite local spot for sushi! It easily beats the prices and quality of other sushi bars in this area.  GLUTEN FREE FRIENDLY! Woohoo!  I was pleasantly surprised to find out that they did indeed have gluten free soy sauce amongst other GF choices.   The staff is friendly,prompt,accommodating and there's always a positive atmosphere.  If you like spicy, make sure to try the Spicy California roll! It's a perfect spin on the classic roll. I still can't figure out how they keep their fish so fresh. It's the only sushi restaurant that I trust for sushi in the desert.

This is by far the best Mexican Food restaurant in the Phoenix area. I have a gluten intolerance and chef Carlos ALWAYS takes wonderful care of me and my family when we're in. This is more than a restaurant, it's a dining experience! I suggest ordering the Chavez Enchilada next time! It's a gluten free, extra spicy green enchilada. Also, the corn tamales are to die for!

I was seen here on a Saturday afternoon. The visit was quick, I was in and out the door in under an hour. the doctor who I saw was absolutely amazing, understanding and and attentive!  I'll definitely be using only this urgent care in the future.

This is by far my favorite burger place in the valley. Their burgers are to die for, the fries are a taste of perfection and their drink selection is on point.. Did I mention the wonderful service and friendly atmosphere?  I frequent this place at least once a month and have never been disappointed. Everyone is really friendly, they have a great concept of ordering up front instead of waiting for a waiter.. The only thing I think they could improve on is the quality of their gluten free buns... They tend to fall apart really easily...but besides that, everything is delicious. I would recommend this place to anyone!

Mypie has the BEST gluten free pizza crust I have ever tasted. I've been gluten free for about 3.5 years and have tried tons of different pizza's, but this my friend takes the cake! It's a beautifully delicious work of art. I've tried the Hawaiian last time and it was legen...wait for it....dairy!  I have visited this place twice, and now expect to be a regular customer. This place has a wonderful vibe and ambience too! The only thing that they could use improvement on is the staff. For the most part a lot of them are wonderful, but there are a few with some not so friendly faces.    Overall, I love this place and I'm so glad to be able to call it my favorite.

I hate writing a bad review.. But the uniform store needs to know as do customers.  The woman working was very helpful in finding the right sized scrubs for me (this almost makes rating go up.)   However, when I went to try on my pants, I witnessed a very familiar bug which I deal a lot with when working with crisis response team and seeing many types of them in the field due to home visits a while ago. I'm 98% sure it was a  B E D  B U G! I told the woman working at the desk that the small bug attached to the bottom of my uniform looked EXACTLY like a bed bug.. She barely looked at it, killed it with a paper towel and didn't  acknowledged that there was anything SLIGHTLY wrong. I was told "we have no bed bugs here, it's just a bug"  Not just a bug. The worst bug.   If you decide to purchase your uniform here, as a precaution, I placed my brand new scrubs in the dryer on high for 60 minutes and it kills the bed bugs.

Love the ambiance, decor and staff but the food sucks. I've been here a couple of times because my mom loves this place.. But i don't see the appeal for food. However, I only have had items off of their gluten free menu.

BEST INDIAN FOOD IN PHOENIX!  The food deserves five stars as does the service! They have a great selection of gluten free and vegetarian options.  My personal favorite is the chicken tandoori with a side of yogurt sauce. If you're looking for the perfect way to end your meal; the mango Lassi is a delicious dessert to indulge in!  Why only 4 stars? You get what you pay for rings true. This place is very pricy, but If I could eat at only one restaurant for the rest of my life, this would be it.   Sadly, spending $30 for just one persons meal is a jaw dropper. Thus, I have given this place 4 starts for being overpriced and having rice be an additional side order.   HOWEVER, they have reasonably priced and a creative lunch menu that makes up for the very expensive dinner menu.. If only they could add the chicken tandoori to the lunch menu, I would be there everyday.
