After talking to the owner on the phone, I appreciated how honest he was about pricing. He gave me options and I felt no pressure to schedule or decide immediately.   The next day, I called Dirt Dog back and they were able to fit us into their busy schedule the same day. I got a courtesy call as promised as to when I could expect them.   TJ arrived on time,  if not a little bit early. He was very professional, friendly and informative. He quickly fixed the issue and asked if I had any other concerns regarding plumbing. At the time, I said no.  That evening I realized that I was supposed to have another leak fixed and failed to tell TJ. I called TJ and he offered to come back the following day without any hesitation.   We really appreciate the way Dirt Dog runs their business. Customer service and HONESTY goes a long way. Very refreshing to know there are still business like Dirt Dog around. They will be our go-to plumber from now on.  Petra and Rick Sullivan

I called the Rolex Service Center because my watch was not running properly. They recommended Hamra Jewelers since they have the only Rolex Authorized Watchmaker in the state. Well, that made me happy because now I didn't have to ship my watch to Rolex.  My first impression was it's a beautiful store. They have a great selection of  jewelry and an awesome selection of watches.  They have the biggest collection of Rolex watches I have ever seen! The staff  is friendly and knowledgeable. They made the process of repairing my Rolex very easy, and also helped me upgrade my wife's diamond ring for our anniversary while I was there. Their selection of diamond rings is great! I upgraded my wife's ring to a little over a 2.50 carat diamond. She was thrilled when she received the ring! Thank you Hamra Jewelers! You have a customer for life.   If you're looking for spectacular jewelry and watches, Hamra Jewelers is the only place to go!  Highly recommend

I really would rather not leave a review and keep this place a secret because of my own selfishness! Haha!    Sushi is super fresh and beautiful. The portions are appropriate. The soft shell crab tempura is delicate and crisp. If you like wasabi, asked for the "chopped wasabi!" It will make your meal an adventure!    We used to be a chain restaurant type of sushi people but we now truly appreciate the small, quaint and unique dining experience!

Love the pizza, the manager, not so much. I've been ordering for delivery for over two years at our new house, and one day the manager says its out of the delivery area.  I asked to speak with the manager and he noted that we resent my ordered form them, but that it wasn't happening tonight. I'm not one to get mad, but I will not be using this location anymore! No matter what! Please be consistent and polite

Ken and his crew a Signature Graphics are professional and a class act. Nobody even comes close.

Not trying to be mean but it was simply forgettable. The staff was unorganized, it seemed that one girl out of six or seven employees did everything except ringing up the guests. The pizza was ok, and decor was boring at best.  I wish them luck but a manager that's observant is needed.
