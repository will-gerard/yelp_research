Atmosphere is spot on. Food was great. We went on a Sunday morning so it wasn't very busy. The waitress was also the bartender below so we didn't get as much attention as I'm sure we would have normally. Would definitely go again!

John over at Bronson Guitar Works is a hero.  A few weeks ago my parents home was burglarized and of all the items that that low life took, there was only one possession that was absolutely irreplaceable. My grandfathers 1993 Modulus 5 String Bass Guitar.  Well, last week a man walked into Bronson Guitar Works trying to get a 1993 Modulus off his hands. John knew immediately that the situation was fishy because the man was asking for way less than it was worth and he even recalled seeing a post on Facebook that one had been stolen. Not only did John come up with the perfect plan to get the man to leave the guitar in his shop, but he immediately went to work contacting my grandfather and inquiring about the bass. (Of course my grandpas info was still in the case- stupid thief). Turns out, Johns intuition and quick thinking paid off for our family. There is no way that we could ever thank him enough and I hope that my fellow Yelpers read this and support his phenomenal business. Thank you, John! You ROCK!

I have been to this place at least 50 times over the course of my life. My parents used to take us here (4 kids) and get the hunan dinner for four.  The reason why this restaurant keeps us coming back and has me referring all of my friends is because you get a big bang for your buck. That, and the food is outstanding. Try the sesame beef and the emperors chicken. It is seriously to die for. I am in North Phoenix now so I spend a little extra drive time, but it is worth the drive. I love that it hasn't changed and it doesn't need to. It is my favorite little hole-in-the-wall! BTW, I was just reading reviews on Yelp to see about trying a new fun restaurant for Valentines day. I typed in Big Heng just to see what people think about it. LOL  If you don't like Big Heng, then I don't like you :D

Ordered a large pizza, 20 wings and a antipasta salad to go. Got home, looked at the salad.. Welted lettuce like literally brown. See photo. The wings were tiny little over cooked bones.. Not enough sauce in the world could make them edible. And the pizza was just meh. Anyways, we drove back to Rays to swap out the wilted salad for something a little more green and get wings with meat on them.. When we talked to the manager and the owner, they were not apologetic for the repulsive food but instead chose to argue and insist that the food was "fine"! Really? If the food was fine, do you think we would have driven all the way back to swap them out? Wow.

Put my niece in soccer for the first time. What a waste of money. They just run around playing capture the flag. Not quite sure how that helps with ball control... Plus, the coach told the kids to let the other team win this time because they won the last two. What is wrong with this facility?

On 3/2/2016, three desktops and two laptops crashed in our office. Four of the five computers are covered with technical support, antivirus protection and other miscellanious coverages so I decided to call Geek Squad and take advantage of the service that we paid for. First, I spoke with a lovely woman- her name was Jerube I believe and she listened to my problem and advised that this issue was probably coming through the server. So she asked me to unplug the router and I did. Immediately afterwards, I lost the call because our phones are linked to the internet. Which meant twenty minutes wasted. So I called back on my cell phone and spoke with Justin. I explained the situation to him and he pulled up the account. By the way this is small business and my boss PERSONALLY owns all of the computers that we use for our District Operation. But Justin insisted that he needed to transfer me to the business department so they can get someone out here to fix. I insisted that this is a personal account but he transferred me anyways. I also asked Justin not to drop me off with someone else but to warm transfer me first and of course he didn't so I explained the situation to Logan. He advised me that he has limited access to the personal side of Geek Squad so he called Zack and placed me on hold. Logan then told me, after consulting with Zack, that they could send someone out for $200 per device and a $99 service charge. That's almost $1,000! So he transferred me back to the personal side and I spoke with Florence. To be honest I could not understand a word coming out of her mouth. All I know is she transferred me over to Lisa who was no help whatsoever so I asked to please speak with her supervisor. Then I was transferred to Guzsan, a supervisor in the scheduling department. I asked him to please schedule a 911 emergency visit because I cannot wait five days, March 7th Lisa told me, before someone comes out to investigate the computers. Anyways Guzsan says to me, "I need to transfer you to another department so that we can fix your order, it has been keyed incorrectly". So he transferred me to John. After eight transfers our connection was so terrible I couldn't hear him and he couldn't hear me so I had no choice but to hang up. 2 and a half hours wasted. So I called back and spoke with Kevin for 30 minutes and just as he was getting somewhere the call was dropped. Then I called back for the last time and spoke with David (nobody leaves notes by the way) and I explained what needed to happen. He then advised me that they can get someone out the next day but it's going to be $700. I told him that this establishment is a joke and I vow to share with everyone what an excruciating experience this was.

Awesome food! We come here exclusively for these ribeye tacos! Well worth the twenty minute drive on our lunch hour.

Worst establishment ever. I do not recommend this salon to anyone. Newsflash Flash Nails- keep your rude and hurtful comments to yourself if you value repeat customers.

I have dreams about their cucumber-mint-lemonade. It's the greatest creation on earth, currently. Thank you Salad and Go. Take my money.
