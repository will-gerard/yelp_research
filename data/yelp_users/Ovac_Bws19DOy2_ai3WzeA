I cannot believe this.  I lived in Chandler for eleven years and never discovered this place until I moved to Tempe for college.  Either way, it's a blessing to the earth.  (+ positive, - negative, -/+ neutral)  + Coffee is fresh and never burnt.  I drink lots and lots of this drug, I know what's up.  -/+ Lots of places to sit, but I just can't get comfortable.  It's too bright inside and the music outside is usually too loud.  However...  + The joint is located on a lake (man-made of course) and it's beautiful.  Once a friend and I passed on the tables and just sat on the edge of the water. Despite the dead fish smell, which wasn't harsh, it was fantastic.  + The employees always ask how you are doing.  They are quick to make drinks and never get distracted.  + Prices are below average.  There are a few items that are a tad overpriced, but in a nutshell this is the place to get an inexpensive good time.  +  PUNCH CARD!! As some of you know, I really like punch cards.  Coffee Rush has them.  Get one.

For years I rolled my eyes when people talked about "amazing" sandwich shops.  "Seriously," I thought, "How can something as simple as a sandwich be amazing?"  It wasn't until I walked into The Lunch Bag and had my first bite of their (amazing) sandwiches that I really understood. Unfortunately, I no longer work near Scottsdale, nor do I live anywhere remotely close.  I've had to say my goodbyes, but I promise The Lunch Bag, my sweet, I will be back. (+ positive, - negative, -/+ neutral)  + Good ole taste of Mom's cooking... 'cept it's not from her.  I truly reconsidered how great my mother's sandwich making skills are after eating the Turkey Green Chili.  Sorry Mom.  Soups made from scratch, fresh meats and breads, AND COOKIES.  + Excellent service.  The ladies who work in the kitchen are always happy and cheerful.  + Pick up orders / delivery.  I personally always took a break from work to stop in, but you can call ahead and pick up, or have them deliver!  -/+ Small dining area.  This is mostly made to cater to the HUGE amount of local business there, so I'm not surprised they only have a handful of table and chairs.  Still a nice place to stop for lunch if you need a break. :)  + You'd think with all this awesomeness there HAS to be a catch with the cost.  Nope.  It's all affordable delicious goodness.  Definitely competitive prices and I'd pick this place every time.

Oh man.  I love this place.  (+ positive, - negative, -/+ neutral)  + Open 24 hours on the weekends.  'Nough said.  + Cheap, but flavorful, drinks.  I always like what I get here.  There is one guy who makes a mean vanilla latte, I have yet to get his name.  + Food.  Good cakes and cookies.  -/+ I've found that a lot of high school kids like to loiter here (and they're loud).  But, hey, it's not XB's fault.  + The people who work here know what they're doing.  They make sure to get your order right.  And they're always friendly.  + They have musical guests every now and then... and it's usually good stuff.

Oh, Coffee Plantation, where didst thou self-respect go?  I've been coming here for a couple of years, and this is what I've decided (+ positive, - negative, -/+ neutral):  - Bad customer service.  There's one employee in particular who treats me like I'm a child every time I order... and she's never happy.  - Messy.  Maybe it's because the joint is on Mill (which is gross to begin with), but I'm guessing it's because the manager doesn't enforce cleanliness.  -/+ Coffee is decent, if not below average.  Don't try any fancy shmancy drinks here, you will be disappointed.

Eh, is really all I have to say.  (+ positive, - negative, -/+ neutral)  + Incense selection is awesome.  I love their stuff.  -/+ Location is terrible.  I don't like Mill Ave., but at least it's close to where I live.  - Poor customer service.  Don't talk to me like I'm stupid and we'll have a great employee/customer relationship.  - Expensive.  Tie-dye shirts for $25?  I'll make my own, thanks.  And I don't know many people that buy smoke supplies here (I don't smoke myself).

+ positive, -negative, -/+ neutral  + The food is amazing.  They cook their tofu just right: crispy, tasty, fresh.  I'm also a huge fan of the Greenburger.  I would have to say it's even better than an In-and-Out burger (although now I'm a vegetarian).  - The food is good, but definitely not healthy.  Grease, with a side of fat.  -/+ Seating could be better.  I don't feel relaxed here.  + One word: Soynamis.  These are frozen yogurt (soy, of course) treats with mix-ins, like fruit, nuts, etc.  Perfection in a cup.  -/+ Service.  They get your order in quickly and get the food to you fast.  However, I always find myself a little bummed out after ordering, they never smile!  + Limeade.  It's really, really good.

Are there really words in the English language to describe how wonderful this food is?  Not even close.  This is by far the best Middle Eastern cuisine I've had in the valley.  Lots of entrees to choose from, so many different desserts, and if you're feeling bold, you can try one of their unique drink options. (+ positive, - negative, -/+ neutral)  -/+ Sometimes the wait can be long, especially during lunch hour.  But I wouldn't say that this should keep you away.  The food is worth it.  + Chicken Shawarma  + Gyros  + Lots of food.  Sometimes you have to roll me out to the car when I'm done... and I STILL have left overs.  + Friendly, helpful staff that will make you feel at home.  -/+  Decor.  I've heard some people hate on the "look" of the restaurant.  It's not a wine and dine kind of place and honestly, it's not that bad.  It's just a bunch of tables and chairs, but is that what you're there for?  No, you're there for the amazing, bountiful meal that your little tummy has been begging for.  It's clean, whether some people say that or not.  I'm pretty sure they wouldn't win Best-of awards for almost 30 years if they were bad at keeping things picked up.

Been to Steve's a few times.  Time for a review.  (+ positive, - negative, -/+ neutral)  + Good ambiance.  Low lighting and sweet music.  I really enjoy studying here.  + Slightly above average coffee.  I've had better, but Steve's still has really good drinks.  + Awesome prices.  I'm in college and I really like saving my money.  -/+ Customer service is alright.  One time I was there only one barista working.  He was obviously a high school student and had other important things going on.  Two of his friends came in and chatted him up at the counter... and they weren't quiet.  Then, he left the counter, with no one else there, to go outside for a smoke and talk with his little friends.  Nothing happened in result, but I thought it was rude.

I'm an avid reader and ever since I visited City Lights Books in San Francisco, I was desperate to find a good independent bookstore in the East Valley.  Although Changing Hands is not quite City Lights, it comes in close second.  Here's why (+ positive, - negative, -/+ neutral):  + They are organized.  Nothing Like Bookman's.  + They have wonderful customer service.  I love everyone that works here.  They are always willing to help you find a book you'll enjoy.  Plus, they're knowledgeable, unlike B&N employees.  + Book signings here are bomb.  I saw Stephanie Meyer shortly after she published Twilight.  It was legit.  + PUNCH CARD!! Any bookstore that has a punch card is a friend in my book.  I actually have a full one right now that I need to utilize to get my 10% off!  -/+ I like Paradise Bakery, but I don't like them hitched to a bookstore.  It can be noisy sometimes.

After hearing a friend talk about this place like it's coffee was gold, I decided to check it out.  I've been to 3 Roots at least four times and this is what I've confirmed (+ positive, - negative, -/+ neutral):  -/+ Service is a 50/50.  Some baristas are awesome, some I'd like to slap back into reality.  - Prices suck.  At 3 Roots I tried the pita/veggie plate and it was definitely not worth the nine bucks.  A few slices of carrots, broccoli and celery, a dab of hummus and a stale pita.  Gross.  + Vanilla latte.  At least they know how to make the most generic latte in the world.  - I once tried their Irish cream.  I will never again ask for anything that sounds fancy.

Please, please, PLEASE do your body good and get your piercing done at HTC.  They are the best in Arizona, I can guarantee you that.  (+ positive, - negative, -/+ neutral).    + Beautiful selection of jewelry.  They have bone, wood, glass...  + They know what they're doing.  I actually had my tragus corrected here because the last guy who did it (tattoo shop, of course) did it wrong.  -/+ I have yet to decide what I think of their customer service.  Ninety-nine percent of the time they're very helpful, understanding and polite.  Once, however, I thought one guy was going to have a fit because I took my gauges out.  How was I supposed to know that was unhealthy practice?  Maybe he was just having a bad day...  + Ask them anything.  No question is too dumb, believe me, I've asked plenty of them.

Best coffee I have tasted, by far, in the short 20 years of my life.  Here's why (+ positive, -negative, -/+ neutral):  + They're a hole-in-the-wall joint.  That means little to no traffic, cozy, fast.  + Simple menu.  It really bugs me when coffee shops have a hundred-and-one different drinks up on the board.  Seattle Espresso's menu does not mess with your mind.  -/+ The baristas are average.  Most of the time I come in and they're friendly, but once I had a guy treat me like I wasn't even there.  His friend came in and they started talking... while he was making my drink and when I paid.  +++ I LOVE THEIR DRINKS.  Their espresso is smooth and blends well.  Their cup sizes are decent.  They have very unique flavors, my favorite being the white mocha.  The coffee experience here is sublime, to say the least.

Oh. My. Goodness.  Since I'm vegetarian, I can only get a bean and cheese burrito (yes, I know the beans are made of lard).  But I still love this place!  + Prices are cheap!  Good, cheap Mexican food always sounds good to me.  - Location.  Kind of hidden, hard to find.  + Horchata.  Yes, mmm, horchata.  It's really, really good here.  + Better than Filly B's by far.  Just the right amount of beans and cheese in a warm but moist tortilla.  Heaven in a wrapper.

Whenever you want a refreshing drink, go to Tea Infusion.  (+ positive, - negative, -/+ neutral)  + Comfy tables and chairs.  It's a bit like a coffee joint, a place to sit, relax, and talk with friends.  + The tea selection is AMAZING.  I don't drink too much tea myself, but I know my friends like it.  They have fresh tea in boxes and have a very large assortment.  + You can do so much to your drink.  Blend, ice, hot, boba.  I like to get smoothies (they also put green tea in their smoothies) with boba.  It's delicious.  - Location.  A place like this should NOT be sandwiched between stores in a crappy mall.  It would be better in a shopping center, away from Tempe Marketplace.  -/+ Food is alright.  If you're looking for a snack, good, but if you're looking for a decent sands

A friend of mine works across the street from this place and he gets food here all the time.  He once took me there and this is what I've concluded:  (+ positive, - negative, -/+ neutral)  + TVs for games.  I'm a football girl and I like big flatscreens to watch games on.  +I'm not 21 yet, but this place has a nice feel as far as bars go.  - Food is gross.  Plain and simple.  Yes, I am a vegetarian, but the only thing I didn't eat was the meat... and it still wasn't good.  A burrito should be good with or without meat.  - Open seating.  It's a garage-turned-restaurant (or it least it looks like it) and so the place is WIDE open.  There tall bar stools and tables everywhere and the only nice place to sit is on couch-benches that don't have tables.  -/+  I guess if you're drunk and need a little something-something to eat, this would be a good place to go.  But it's not a good place to get a good meal.  - Prices suck.  If you're going to do it Chipotle style, at least be cheaper than the chain.

Solo is definitely one of my favorite places to get espresso now.  After checking out the great reviews on here, I decided to skip on my usuals (XB, Steve's)  and come here.  (No negatives or neutrals this time!)  + Great location.  Strip mall, not too much traffic.  The storefront faces Baseline, so you can sit in comfort and watch cars go by.  + The atmosphere is amazing!  I walked in and automatically felt at home.  There are couches, benches, tables, outside seating.  Everything you want in a coffee shop.  There's beautiful photography on the walls (which you can buy), including one of Jared Leto (or at least it looks just like him).  And there are plenty of places to plug in your laptop.  + Local coffee!! I love it when local shops use homegrown stuff.  I had never had this kind of espresso, but all I can say is that it's damn good.  I can't remember the name, though.  + The drinks.  Oh. My. Word.  I ordered a cafe mocha with no whip.  It was smooth, creamy, and had just the right amount of mocha.  It was to die for.  Also, if you're a big foam fan, you'll love any of their hot drinks.  I had about an inch of foam in my cup and it was thick and flavorful.  + The service is just as great as the coffee.  The guy at the counter was polite, helped me choose a good drink, and smiled.    I must say, it's going to be very difficult for me to find a place better than here.

Oh sweet, sweet Brio.  I absolutely love this place.  I wouldn't change a thing about it.  Yes, it's a chain, but I definitely give props to a restaurant chain that makes food as delicious as Brio.  There are no negatives or neutrals about this place.  + Wonderful service.  Our waitress was so nice.  She helped me make a decision on my meal and she was very knowledgeable of the menu.  Also, the other employees were happy and spunky.  + You can add or modify your meal as needed.  A lot of big restaurants (especially more expensive ones) don't allow you do personalize your meal.  + FOOD.  Oh my goodness.  If you want a meal that is flavorful, cooked right, and unique, you have to try this place.  I ordered the Mushroom Ravioli and it was the best meal I've ever had.  I could taste the different cheeses, the pasta was cooked perfectly, and it melted in my mouth.  My mom ordered a chicken dish and it came with two large chicken breasts and vegetables (she substituted rice for veggies).  Of course, I'm vegetarian and can't eat meat, but the veggies were ridiculous!! They were so delicious.  + Prices and portions.  Yes, the prices are a tad high, but the portions make it worth it.  I had ten large raviolis stuffed well with mushrooms.  It could easily be split into two meals.  + Creme brulee.  They have about eight different kinds of creme brulee to choose from.  I ordered the chocolate cake, the original and caramel.  Fantabulous.  Spectacular.  Even if you don't eat a meal here, you MUST try their desserts!!  It will be the best thing you ever do for yourself.

There are a lot of frozen yogurt places to check out, but Yogurtini is by far my favorite.  (+ positive, - negative, -/+ neutral)  + The place is freaking adorable.  I know it sounds a little strange, but I love the colors they picked for the place.  The blues and greens MAKE me want to eat their yogurt.  -/+ The frozen yogurt.  Although I do love their vanilla flavor, it doesn't taste like "original" frozen yogurt.  They do make a homemade yogurt, and I haven't tried it, but I'm guessing that one must taste more like the classic frozen yogurt.  + SO. MANY. TOPPINGS.  Hot sauce? Yes.  Gummy worms? Yes.  They have all the fruits you love, and definitely all the candy you love, to make your frozen yogurt just the way you want it.  (I personally like to mix my vanilla yogurt with peanut butter and chocolate chips).    + Punch cards.  This is a big thing for me.  Of course I'm gonna come back if a company is going to reward me for my loyalty.
