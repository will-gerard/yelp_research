I have been eating at this location since I was 11 and now 28.  The food has always been consistent and was my first choice for the food at my wedding.  Honestly every is great but I find myself getting the hard tacos and bean with potato burrito.  A must go for anyone

Always friendly staff and consistent drinks.  I have even been to a concert at this location.  This coffee bean seems like the local coffee hangout that Starbucks once tried to be.  They hand tamp shots and it creates a much bolder rich flavor that can only be done by a real person. A+++

I don't want to tank this place because the host couldn't seat people properly.  We actually never got seated because waited so long.  All I can judge this place on was the employees and they were talking crap about the customers, so I'm sure I wont come back to this location anytime soon unless they actually accept a reservation.

This place was messy and loud.  The food really wasn't great and the salsa bar looked like a three year old put it together.  Overall the only plus was the tortilla chips that were free before the food.  I will not be back unless one of my friends pays for me

To start everything is made from scratch and the bread and dough for the pizza are just a small offering in fresh items.  The daily specials that actually change daily show that Pino is in it to win it.    My family at party of eight had a wonderful night and all the food including the pizza carnivore (fresh made sausage), spaghetti and meatballs, chicken salad and  my mother asked if they could make chicken parm  (which is the best item they make) even though it is not on the menu and is usually a special for weekends.  Always a great place and as everyone else in their review has said Pino will come out to talk to you and the wait staff does remember and care about their job.    The food above all speaks for itself, go enjoy.

First with the good, every tasted good.  Now the bad one the price to start and the portions.  The pizza we purchased was 40.00 and maybe should have been 20.00.  The large pizza is the size of any regular small pizza.  We tryed it because it was new to us and will never be back.  Don't waste your time or money try Pullanos a real pizza place.

To start off like everyone else the Pricing on popcorn and drinks are high and to get a snack god forbid you may wait a few minutes.  The theaters sound and video are world class and make other movies look blurry.  The quality of the movie will have you coming back and the half price on Tuesday or Thursday doesn't hurt too.

Wonderful energy in this location.  No one is pushy and always laid back.  They seem to have the perfect blend of getting you what you want and need but not bothering you.  Any chance I get I will come back because honestly you can order anything including tofu and be happy here.

Good value a large pizza that's actually large for 5.95 pick up.  I have tried a fee different pizza and would recommend the bacon pizza it goes well with their sweet Tomato sauce.  The pepperoni is also good and the wings are good and the price is right.  There is another older location off of grande ave hole in the wall but the food speaks for itself.

To start I didn't even have a donut I had an died coffee carmel latte  .  I am a big coffee bean fan and didn't expect much because I don't run  on Duncan but my wife and I were surprised very good flavor not overly sweet.  Lastly for 3.75 it was 30oz of coffee which for two people is perfect.  I will be back and my Starbucks snob wife even said she liked it..
