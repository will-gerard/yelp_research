Horrible experience. Go in for happy hour with my dad at 4:45 and sit at the bar. No one else is there, not their fault but still weird. All the bottles of alcohol are still covered with paper cups, the beer taps are still wrapped and plugged, and the 10 staff are all hovered in the corner. No reason the place is empty!!!!!!! Got our nachos wrong but surprisingly the burger was amazing.  Only reason this gets 2 stars is it's connected to the baseball stadium.  P.s: prepare to pay for parking too! We risked the ticket and got lucky on the meters after it expired

The only down side is the prices, but then again in life you pay for what you get. It's a healthy grocery store, but this review is mainly for the deli where you can get made to order sandwiches. Stop by and get their grilled chicken, throw some pesto and aoili on it and whatever else you like. You won't be disappointed I promise. Get a Hubert's Lemonade on the way out too.

Take your time and money elsewhere. Stopped in on the way home from Vegas yesterday. It was 11:30 and although I hated being that guy that comes in 30 minutes before closing time, we were starving and had to. The staff at Applebee's took a new approach to how to treat customers who walk in a little before closing... They ignored us. We sat at the table for about 10 minutes, making eye contact with multiple staff members. Soon enough we had it and walked over to the bar and grill next door, who was more than happy to serve us and take our money!  Will never go back to this location, let alone any other Applebee's.

Went here last night for a concert for the first time and was overly impressed. Compared to the outdoor venues or US Airways Center it is definitely more intimate and fan friendly. Beers were expensive but decent size and the location is just a few short blocks to City Scape. Combined dinner and a show, you can even light rail for those that are up for public transportation. Comerica Theater gets my vote for best concert venue in Phoenix.

The only bad thing about Roaring Fork is trying to find it and parking your car in a office building parking lot. Once you get inside everything is great, even if you end up sitting on the patio. I've taken a date there, gone to happy hour with the guys, and even treated the parents to a good steak. Green chile appetizer is unique and the Big Ass Burger is phenomenal. Beer and wine selection is fantastic, only draw back is I'm always too full for dessert.   TIP: Go on Monday's for all day happy hour!

Perfect spot for anyone who loves sports and great food. We celebrated a birthday for a friend last night at Don and Charlie's and everything was perfect. Make sure you have a reservation on Friday and Saturday nights, we had one and by passed a 30 minute wait. Start with an app and hey check in here on yelp and it's FREE! The steak sandwich is unique in that's it's not a sandwich at all but rather a genii round sized steak with cheese bread, best plate at the table in my opinion. Did I mention they had old style, nothing like a fancy steak and a can of old style. You pay for what you get and in this case it's a great ambiance, great food, and great service!

Three words: Papago Orange Blossom! Great spot that features one of the best beer selections in town. They have a pint of the week and also features an extensive take out beer selection. Of course I can never turn away from the usual choice of Papago Orange Blossom. I take a growler of it home every time, that's how good it is.  I've got shirts, growlers and even tap handles from Papago so trust me when I say it's a must stop if in the neighborhood. Don't be fooled by the strip mall that looks abandon type of vibe. It may be tricky to find but worth the look.  Added bonus they have darts, shuffleboard, and board games all for free!!

Only great things to say about this place: had a drive thru (not too fat and lazy to walk in but ice cream and December = cold outside), they saw a dog in the car with me and they gave him his own ice cream bowl for free, and the price tag for the ice cream was overall reasonable! Would recommend this location to anyone!

I give Coronado 4 stars but others will probably give it 1. We played on a Sunday afternoon and walked right on with no tee time, PLUS. They were using temp tee boxes and greens so the course was kind of a joke. BUT it was perfect for a group of college kids like us or a great place to little kids learning to play. Reasonably priced for what you get. and Happy Hour in the clubhouse from 4-8 is the place to be.

A friend brought me in here yesterday to try the winter seasonal. We happen to go on a Sunday during the football games and they were featuring an all day happy hour. The seasonal was a dollar off (not much but can't complain) and all hand crafted cocktails were 5 dollars. Not usually martini and margarita type of person but for over 50% off we couldn't resist. All four of us got manly martinis, cosmos, and margaritas.  The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is because I think the Four Peaks winter seasonal is better, nothing Gordon Biersch can do about that...

Great environment, sat on the patio and watched the playoff games. Good food and great beer selection! Good specials for breakfast on weekends and great happy hour if you're like us and drink your way from happy hour all the way to reverse happy hour!  Definitely would recommend to friends!

This review is long over due. I remember when Dave's Dog House was a little off campus by Barney's boathouse. Then getting Dave's from their cart after long drunken nights on Mill and ASU Football games, which I don't really remember too well. Now being on Campus, they have found the perfect spot. The go to is the Boston Dog. I get mine with ketchup instead of mustard, just because of an incident a few years ago with Mustard, I will spare you the details. Try their specials they have rotating and get some tots while you're at it. This place has been and will always be one of my favorite places to eat at ASU.

Didn't actually play here. We tried to, the pro was a jerk and service was terrible. Save the hassle and go play Coronado down the street. Same dive golf course, friendlier, and cheaper too

What a beer selection! What a food selection! Big portions of both too, our server, his name was Matt but I didn't catch his last name, recommended the nachos and a Papago Orange Blossom. The side salad portions were worth the price as well and we even tried some of their specialty cocktails that Matt sold us on. Both were great and they even brought out a birthday dessert for my friend. The environment was good with football on during a Sunday, would definitely go back, even for lunch and a quick yard of beer. Don't get fooled by the chain restaurant gimmick, this place is the real deal for foodies and beer enthusiasts alike.

I like dueling piano bars, don't get me wrong. BUT IM NEVER GOING HERE AGAIN. The management has no respect for their customers.

Very hipster, but the pasties make it worth coming back. It's tough to stray from my go to: The Pilgrim (it's like thanksgiving in your mouth everyday of the year). They have over 20 different varieties to choose from though, so it's sure to please the entire group.  TIP: Wash it down with one (or two or more) 3 dollar Irish Car Bombs all day everyday

Little expensive on gas but has good food choices: Taco Bell and Pizza Hut. Gas was 3.11 and the staff is friendly. Not bad considering the location

The moms was in town this weekend and the only was to cure a tough ASU football loss was to head to Chompies on Sunday morning. We were prepared for the 30 minute wait for a table of 5, but grabbed a pastry from the front while we waited. The reviews said I had to try the sliders, so I did Jewish sliders with fries hit the spot. No room for the dessert but grabbed a pastry to go and got another for the moms for FREE for checking in. Yelp always comin in clutch for the moms!

Stopped by here after the Cardinals game. Went to the Yard House for a beer first and rather than wait for a table for 30 minutes we decided to try out Which Wich; what a great choice that was. The wicked sandwich was wicked huge and the medium was too big to even finish. Only thing is be careful when you're filling out your bag drunk, those marks are taken seriously and when you accidentally put cucumber they put it on there. Put as much as you'd like on, no extra charge for pesto either. Great sandwich, great portions, great price. Not going to be in Glendale much, but definitely will check out the new location on Mill Ave.

Stumbled upon this hidden gem. Try the chicken fettuccine or the pesto pasta with gyro meat. Big portions and the salad and bread stick is a nice touch.

Went Christmas shopping here this week and it had everything I need. Conveniently had all the frames I was looking for, in stock, and was able to get photo albums, stockings, and santa hats all in one place. Being located in Tempe Marketplace helps too. I will definitely be back to this location.   Beware that parking is somewhat had to find during the holidays.

Four reasons for four stars:  1. The staff: Great group of guys (and gals) that are friendly, down to earth, genuine people when they help you. They're not fake friendly either! 2. Open til 3am. After late nights at work it's the perfect RELIABLE spot. Not to mention 2:45 after the bars. Just make sure to tip when you stumble in at 2:45, remember they put up with you every time. 3. The chicken pesto sandwich is amazing! Enough said. 4. They have coupons / deals everyday, you hardly ever have to pay full price but always get 110% quality.  Will get five stars when I find a fifth reason

Used a yelp coupon for the meal, but still would pay full price. The bobbie is amazing, the turkey they use really makes it stand out against the competition. Only issue with this location is the parking. Slim to none. Still worth the hassle.

Let me preface this by saying, it's the Verizon Store and I knew what to expect.  I am still waiting for one Verizon Store to come along and surprise me one day. By actually giving me prompt service, not having 12 employees in the store and only 5 of them working, not trying to up sell you on products you don't need, and for god sakes just give you what you need in a timely manner. Not too much to ask for.  This one was just like all the others; was 4th in line on their check-in, but still had to wait 23 minutes to even be talked too. In that time I saw employees standing there. The iPhone 5 products were all out of stock, not their fault but just added to the bad experience.  Driving out of the parking lot I drove by an AT&T, maybe it's time I made the switch...

Checked in here Saturday night, just getting around to the review today. Probably best for C.A.S.A that I let me steam simmer down two days before writing the review. It was an overall bad experience, the only thing that I can compliment the establishment on is the great heaters they have. Those bad boys kept the whole patio toasty. Service was so/so, nothing to complain about. Over priced drinks, small food portions (small price tag however), and bad customer service from the other staff besides our waitress. The bar staff and the security must not have realized we spent a good 300 dollars there as a group that night because they treated us like they wanted us gone. The place has great intentions, just not quite there yet.

Tried to come here for lunch today. Sign advertised 5.95 lunch and I work right across the street, so I thought what the heck... "it can't be that bad." Well we will never know cause they were closed for lunch. No sign, no explanation, just flat out locked doors. Unacceptable.  The only reason this place gets two stars is they offer free chips and salsa with check-in. Fun fact, 94% of mexican restaurants already offer free chips and salsa.

Just opened, went there for lunch with some work friends. They had a great friday afternoon lunch special and were giving out free drinks for the grand opening. The manager, in fact all of the employees, were very welcoming and catered to us throughout the meal. Sit down restaurant service, at fast food pace and price. Will be back for lunch again soon. Recommend over the boring subway lunch that you're used to.

Nothin fancy about this Jimmy Johns. Great sandwiches, fast service and it won't ever disappoint. Great option if you're tired of the subway and port of subs down the street.

I first used Uber in Washington, DC and I guess I chose the right time to move to Phoenix, just as Uber was launching here. The perfect way to travel on dates, to and from mill ave, or just as an alternative to the stupid lightrail once every blue moon. You'll impress whoever you're traveling with by making it seem like you're spending a pretty penny on them, when in reality it's more affordable than a normal taxi. In this day and age time is money and Uber is convenient in every aspect and 99% of the time your driver is going to give you awesome service: not limited to water for you and your guest, control of the music (probably most important), and I even had a guy throw in some jokes in there for free once. Don't be fooled by the wanna be Uber companies, there is only one way to travel in Phoenix.

Great hidden gem. Drinks are thoughtfully created and artfully made. They have classics and ones you can't find anywhere else. Their liquor selection is extensive, everything from Pappy to Fernet. It's a great place to grab a drink with coworkers after work or bring a date after dinner. Definitely will be back.  p.s no tv's, so don't plan on watching any sporting events there. Not a downside at all, makes it more intimate and genuine but worth noting if there's something particular you wanted to watch with your cocktail.

Any pizza is a personal pizza is try hard and believe in yourself. That's the motto at most places because the personal ones are too small and the small are just a little too big for one. Here at Pizza Studio, perfect size for one and you don't leave hungry or embarrassed that you just ate a WHOLE pizza.  The starving artist pizza is usually my go to. Simple, easy, quick and best bang for your buck. But if you're willing to fork over a few extra bucks and customize your own, you can add as many toppings as you'd like.  Don't take my word for it but try it for yourself. Great place for lunch if you work downtown and are sick and tired of Jimmy Johns and Chipotle.

My first mistake was going in at 12:15 on a Thursday afternoon, during the middle of lunch rush, to a place that has only been open a couple weeks. That one's on me. From there on out, on them.  Burger lunch special wasn't so special. Bun was warm and soft but HUGE and you had to search to find the small "1/3lb patty". Every bite was 3/4 bread and 1/4 everything else. I know it's the cheap lunch special, but at least make it somewhat tasty if you're going to advertise it in every building.  Fries were meh! Surprisingly long line just to refill your soda pop. Couldn't quite figure that one out.  Only good thing I can think of, great location and great vibe inside. Hope they figure things out and stick around so I can give it a second chance.

As good as it gets for Italian Beefs in the Valley of the Sun! It's a must try for anyone craving authentic Chicago style food. What to get: Italian Beef add sweet and hot peppers and most importantly their cheese fries. They give you the side of cheese so you can dip or drench your fries at your own pace. Although this is fast food, don't expect to be in and out quick on your lunch break. It's ALWAYS busy!
