Best Greek food I had in Arizona and excellent entertainment.  The dolma's were the best I've had, their version of Babaganoush was very good and they had many lamb-based dishes.  The entertainment was great. Live music, belly dancing, greek-style fun, broken plates, and dancing.  Since I had the sampler plate I can tell you that if you're vegan, vegetarian or any other wacko thing like that, you might not enjoy the food here (Greek Lasagna?....really?) Also, the chicken was no good but I don't really like chicken anyway.

This place has had its ups and downs and now in true conformity to the name of city it's in, it has risen from the ashes.  When it first opened this place was awesome: Hentai playing in the bar area and good spicy tuna rolls which were my favorite at the time.  Over time the restaurant went downhill, the quality of the fish was lowered and overall it seemed too overpriced for what you got. The yellowtail tataki was probably the only thing that kept being good through its down phase. Hentai on the projector was replaced with weird video effects that go with the music.  Now the place has increased the quality of fish, they have fresh chopped wasabi available on request and a great selection of cold Sake. Hentai isn't back but Anime replaced the video effects. I'm happy to go to Zen 32 again.

This is the worst Sushi restaurant. I guess I never learn because they gave me food poisoning more than once from the eel.  Don't get adventurous here because they'll make you hate all the good stuff that you would enjoy otherwise. One such example is their uni which is not fresh and served in too large a portion.  The service is also terrible. They have a lame attitude and last time I got the caterpillar roll, I told the waiter that it tasted bad so he laughed and walked away not offering to exchange it. I ended up paying for it with part of his tip.  Their rolls are humongous so if you're a glutton who doesn't care about taste, this could be your sushi place. Most rolls contain lots of fake crab.

Updated 8/15/2008   This place used to be the best but it has gone down hill terribly while the prices remained very high.  They used to have the freshest fish and now they have some really foul tasting tuna and salmon which has gotten me sick. They advertise their salmon as King Salomon but it really just tastes like raw canned salmon. As I'm a big fan of good Salmon, this will stop me from ever going back.  Service has gotten pretty bad also. The new waitress they have was about absent minded as can be.  The only things I still like at Shimogamo are the live sweet shrimp (ama ebi) and Sea urchin (Uni) but on the live sweet shrimp they have gotten very stingy as they only give you one head and they split the body in 2 pieces.  The establishment stank like rotten cabbage and I've noticed it being not well maintained behind the sushi bar. Another annoyance is that they are only open for lunch on Fridays now.  There are much better options around and at this momemnt Sushi Kee 3 blocks east on Warner (at Rural) is a lot better.

The selection of mountain bikes is GIANT and KONA. All the prices on those bikes are full MSRP. The GIANT rental bikes they have at 50$ range are low quality and not very good for riding South Mountain. The chain got tangled up and there was a giant amount of black sludge around it (forgive the pun)  Accessories are all full price and only expensive selections.  People working there are helpful but also trying to pull every dime out which makes me believe that they are more concerned about making more money than giving you what you need.  I test rode a few bikes but the process was excruciatingly slow with many people working there but few people paying attention to customers.

They sell your e-mail address to spammers!  If you reserve your tee time with them online, they will sell your e-mail address to Viagra and penis enhancement spammers. It happened to me. I used a unique e-mail address with them and next thing I know, I start getting spam on that e-mail address.   I confronted them about it and they denied it and didn't take any action which makes them worse.  The golf facilities are mediocre so don't even bother.

This is one of my favorite Sushi restaurants and I eat a lot of sushi.   About the fish: - The fish is mostly fresh but not always so try a few things before deciding on a big order. - Big Eye tuna isn't tasty. They sometimes have Blue Fin. - The Salmon is of high grade and I almost never get a bad cut (if you ever ate salmon at Ra, you'd know what a bad cut is). - The types of fresh fish can change and sometimes they have delightful new additions.  About the cooking: - The rice is always cooked right and doesn't taste like Vinegar. - Rice is warm and fish is cold which is the way to get the most out of sushi. - Fresh chopped wasabi is added on request. If you eat sushi with fresh wasabi, you'll never be able to eat it without. The green horseradish that most places serve doesn't even taste similar.  About the drinks: - Good selection of cold sake. - It's not the place for sake bombers.  About the service: - The waiting service in this place is pretty bad. Drinks are rarely refilled. - The chef is pleasant to talk to and very professional. - Soup and salad comes included with every meal. - Sometimes the chef lets me try new items on the house. - This restaurant doesn't take American Express but don't let that deter you because you'd be missing out on the great food. - All you can eat Sushi Saturday nights is pretty good.  About the rolls: - Not a big fan of rolls myself but they are tasty. The kee roll with spicy tuna is my favorite and the lobster roll is very special.  About the to go service: - You call this place and they won't tell you who they are. You have to ask specifically if it's sushi Kee. So strange....

Great service, perfect quality, fast, and hassle-free.  This is the place I trust to alter my clothes.  Sometimes he does work while I wait and watch TV, which compared to most tailors, is lightning-fast.

This place does terrible work, and they treat their customers like thiefs.   I needed to have some stuff re-scanned after they left pube hair marks smack in the middle of my face on 120 film scans from my sister's wedding. They acted like I was trying to get the stuff re-scanned for free. Why would anyone want that if the first scan was good to begin with? Then they accused me of losing the CD and coming back to get a free CD from them.   Terrible service and extremely unfriendly. Stay away.  Was thinking about getting a used Leica from them with warranty but after seeing how they treat people, forget it. I'll forget they exist. It will be better.  And their prices are extremely high. Especially on printing.

Took a Cannonade to be repaired at this shop. They fixed it quickly and in a manner that was better than expected and at a great price.  Selection of American-made bikes is nice.  Accessories are expensive and no great deals on anything besides bikes. Some accessories I asked for were not available but it wasn't why I was there.  The neighborhood is pretty scary and I even saw a crackhead hooker that stank and who was asking about a bike that someone stole from her. Very entertaining.

LAAAAME. Only cool thing is the girls bathing in the doorway. Otherwise, it's cramped, douche bags with flashlights telling you to move left right, and all around. Drinks are very expensive. Music sucks. Dance floor is impossible to dance on. I had passes I got from the vegas nights web site but they wouldn't accept them so I had to pay full cover.  Never again.

What an over-rated pretentious place.  We went there on a wine club bike and dine event. First impression was nice. Bike parking by the water entrance, nice patio with trees.  We had a section outside reserved for our group but that section was not covered by trees and we didn't have any more places to sit or even stand comfortably so we sat down at a table next to the group on the patio.  10 minutes later no one brought us water or asked if we wanted anything but  a douche of a waiter covered in colorful tattoos told us we couldn't sit there because it was reserved for guests. I asked him why he thought that we weren't guests and he gave me an attitude about how this is for different guests and we had to get up in a threatening voice. He probably wanted this table for a tip that otherwise wouldn't have went directly to him.  Despite their greediness we still stayed with the group and went inside where I had a Mexican coke but I didn't think that it was warranted to spend 30 dollars on some ribeye tacos and a fancy alcoholic drink because I don't like being treated like cattle.  Within 15 minutes 4  tables opened up and I went back outside where I sat down at a table again and the tattooed jackass gave my wife and me a mean intimidating look as if he was about to get violent to the point that my wife was scared of him and wouldn't dare sit down.  I wonder if they hire their wait staff directly out of tent city.  Anyway, I'm not going back.

Beef is hard and chewy, and the dough is meh. Having had Cornish Pasties in UK, this doesn't even compare. I think they should make their menu with fewer, better choices.

Great place to get food if you don't feel like having to pick between 5 different brands of the same stuff like in regular grocery stores. They pick the best stuff and offer it to their customers.  This is the only place where I buy stuff based on their samples.  Some items which are unusual  but very welcome are things like frozen mashed potatoes. The convenience of flake potatoes with the taste of real potatoes.  The only thing that annoys me about this store is the children carts. There are kids that push them in circles or other random patterns and when the store is full of patrons it's almost impossible to navigate.

Why does this place have 5 stars?  And why are so many of his reviewers out of state? Who brings their car from New York to have it fixed by Gene?  I went to Gene's shop with my car and he did incorrect work which did led unnecessary work, charged me more than the dealer would have, tried to milk 850 $ for a new computer (ECU), and pushed me into taking the car to the dealer to have it fixed.   The dealer fixed it by fixing the wiring that Gene did wrong to begin with.   ================= The whole story ======================  The story started when I got Crankshaft and Camshaft sensor error codes on my Nissan Altima 2005.  I bought the parts from Autozone and replaced them myself. It turned out that after spending 5 hours working on getting to a hard to reach sensor, it didn't fix the problem so I decided to take the car to Gene to have it fixed.  He proceeded re-wiring a connector that would no longer clip in after  I undid the crankshaft sensor.  That didn't fix it. He told me the sensors I got from Autozone were no good based on research he did online in auto forums and that I needed OEM sensors. I let him do the job. He replaced the sensors with the dealer sensors and the problem didn't go away.  Next he checked all the wiring for which he charged me 120$ diagnosis fee (dealer charges 90$).   He told me it all checked out fine and that I needed to replace the computer (ECU) for something like 850 dollars.  So I took the car to the dealer to have the computer reprogrammed because usually computers don't just break to the point of no way to repair them. He did encourage me to have the dealer replace the computer so I give him that.   Reprogramming the computer didn't fix the problem so I gave the dealer another 90 for diagnosis of the problem.  The dealer fixed the problem immediately after for 40 dollars! It was the wiring that was bad which Gene redid, and diagnosed for 200$.  Total rip-off Gene. Stay away. If you can't do the job yourself, take it to your dealer.  lesson learned for 370$ fee from Gene, 210$ from the dealer, 70$ in parts from Autozone, 5 hours of time wasted, frustration, and inconvenience of having to ask friends for rides for 5 days.   Ultimately I took the car back to Gene after the dealer fixed it so that he can see what the dealer did. He refunded me 203$ which included diagnosis and CKP sensor replacement sensor. I'm still down 360$ though for the other stuff he did and the money I had to give to the dealer to diagnose, do what Gene did again and re-program the ECU which Gene said was bad.  He also said that I didn't deserve part of the refund because I was the one who broke the connector I had him fix in the first place.  The good part is that I got to hang out with my friend who helped me fix it for the 5 hours.

Got my mountain bike there. Very good deals on bikes and helpful customer service.  Prices on some accessories are a little higher than other stores but some are lower.  Definitely check them out if you are thinking about buying or renting a bike.  They carry FELT bikes which not many stores carry and which are great.

This is the place where they make up in service for any shortcomings they might have. Service is always aware of what is going on at the table and is ready to re-supply and fix things. Manager doesn't just sit around and manage. He actually makes the round and checks to see if customers are good.  The food I had here for the yelp event wasn't very good or very well prepared. The pork was dry and very 3 dollar grocery pork chop with cheese on top. At least it was pre-cut :) Would have preferred it rarer but I had no option. The Mushroom side was good.  Good selection of Saki.  Sushi rolls were good. I don't remember what they were but had chopped jalapeño on them.

This is a great Sushi place to go to but prices a little high. I've never been there during discount price hours and days but I hear you can get a pretty good deal.  The Tazmanian Salmon is great. I even tried the Ama Ebi which was pretty good for pre-frozen shrimp. (the best way to have Ama Ebi is to find a place which has live sweet shrimp)  Selection of cold Sake is great.   People there are interesting. Lots of Asian hookers and white Cougars competing for old Scottsdale douches. Have fun! :)  UPDATE:  The Sutra Sushi web site says Happy Hour is Tuesday through Saturday 4-7. Not many places do Happy Hour on Saturdays....

I really dig this place. It's very nice, clean with a great menu, great hookahs and great service.  It's been around for a long time and the commitment of the owner, who's always there, shows.  Highly recommended.

Asked and was confirmed for a female masseur and was given a male masseur who I didn't want to offend by declining the massage.   He massaged with a very soft grip and pressure which was very awkward because his hand skin was very dry and hard.  About the facilities: Outside light penetrating in the room. Some showers had all he lotions necessary, some didn't even have the bare minimum like shampoo and conditioner. The gym was very basic and while I could use it while waiting for my friends who were forgotten about,  it wasn't properly equipped for free-weight training.  This place sucks if you want to relax. I had a coupon for a special deal but it still wasn't worth it.

Great food. Excellent location. It will now be the spot where I go after riding the Pima Dynamite trails. I had the Prosciutto/Mozarella  sandwich with Ciabatta bread (not on the menu) and it was fantastic. The bread is very good and no cheap ingredients.  Draft Peroni was very good.  Service was fantastic.  Having the patio facing the parking area allowed me to keep an eye on my bike in the car rack while eating.  The only disappointment is that I couldn't have the Nutella Crepe (only served after 5 PM) and in a place like this I would have expected an Eclair on the menu.  UPDATE:   I went back to this place for dinner with a group of friends and their children.   What an amazing place. Excellent food. Really love this restaurant. I wish we had one close to our house in Ahwatukee.   I had the Lamb with some very tasty potatoes. Of course the dipping of the great bread in olive oil and balsamic vinegar was excellent.   The Nutella Crape with strawberries is the best I've had.

Rice was very grainy, fresh wasabi wasn't chopped wasabi and was charged extra for, no uni (not like one should even consider eating uni here), above average prices, all sushi came out at once, rolls with weird looking and tasting vegetables like marinated peppers, and weird tuna tataki roll.  Miso soup: There is no seaweed in it.  Salmon was ok but nothing spectacular. One of the rolls had lemon on top of the Salmon. For me there's nothing worse to ruin raw salmon than to put lemon on top of it.  Toro: Mediocre at best. I've had regular Bluefin that was superior to this over-priced Bluefin Belly (11$ for Nigiri).  The Vietnamese Ice coffee, while good and flavorful, was not as good as it is in real Vietnamese restaurants and really doesn't belong on the menu of a Sushi restaurant.

Don't get why people like the place but then they complain about price. They have a few things that are on sale (usually the stuff that isn't in great demand for some reason or another) and they matched their online price for a table I got. Some stuff that is unusual can be pricey but IKEA is right across the street and while cheaper, a lot of the stuff they carry is not worth the low price.   Thingz carries the recycled steel furniture made in Colorado which I really like.   I find everyone to be helpful and friendly.   The only thing that felt weird about is the cleanliness of the place. For example the high top chairs by the checkout counters were dirty and it was showing in the fabric they were made of.

Fantastic food and service was great. Had the home-made pita bread with the combo appetizer which contained some of the best Babaganoush, and Dolmas I've ever had in addition to the hands down best pita bread in town. It comes hot out of the oven. Also had some sort of oil sesame seed I don't know the name of which was really good. For the main course I had the lamb shank which was nice and soft and came off the bone and onto my rice. Yummy.  The hookahs come from next door and they were good, and the coals were added regularly without having to ask for it.  Service was great with everyone checking on us regularly.  Decor isn't the greatest and has a ethnic-restaurant feel to it but I don't mind that.  Live entertainment with Lebanese music, belly dancer next door, and people dancing was pretty nice.

I'm shopping for a suv and so far i like the jeep grand Cherokee and bmw x6 so i decided to give airpark dodge a chance since they have a srt8 available. It's about the price of the entry level x6 but better performance so i thought it would be an economical alternative.  The salesman that greeted me automatically told me that i couldn't test drive it but he would check with his manager while asking if i wanted to buy it on the spot so i gave him my id and waited a few minutes looking the car over and taking pictures, liking the car despite the dealership floor looking like a tired hospital.  The salesman finally got back and told me that his manager didn't want to let anyone test drive it because of mileage. Not sure if they couldn't afford the gas or because they think that a couple miles on such an "exclusive" car is going to destroy it's resell value but either way, it made me yank my license from his hand and leave promptly.  Terrible way to be treated and awful customer service. Makes me wary about how poorly they might treat people who buy from them and have to bring their cars in for service.

This place is AMAZING. Better than Bellagio for half the price and in Phoenix.  Crab claws, prosciutto, wild boar bacon, the best gelato ever with many non-dairy options including prickly pear gelato.  The only minuses were new potatoes weren't done quite right. It seems like they fry them without pre-boiling them and the eclair was ok but the filling wasn't very good compared to Eclair in Europe. Still better than the Awful monster Eclairs at AJs though.

The food here is great and the Margarita's with good Tequila's are good. The Happy Hour is great. (Where else can you get Patron half-off?)  Being from Europe, Mexican food does not impress me but this is Southern Mexico (Mayan) cuisine with heavy use of Achiote paste.  The style of cooking is also fantastic. Carne Asada Rib-Eye with Fingerling potatoes? How much smarter can you get when it comes to food? Asada tenderized (Asada is a Mexican style of tenderizing meat, for non foodies) fatty beef cut with potatoes that have sweet skin. Absolutely delicious.

They repaired my garage door today, which had a broken spring. As someone who likes to do work on the house myself, this was a task that I was afraid of doing due to the danger of working with springs with a lot of tension. 150 pounds of force can do a lot of damage.  The service went well and I used a yelp coupon.  However, the price I was quoted over the phone and the price I was given at the time of service were very different. Also, the metal bearings I was promised on the phone turned into an upcharge of 35 dollars for a 5 dollar bearing.  In the end I ended up paying the price quoted on the phone plus some weird gasoline upcharge but that wasn't very high so it was ok.  The bearing I still had to pay extra for.  The yelp coupon in the end brought me back to exactly what I was initially quoted, with the metal bearing :)

Recently bought a house and had issues with the speed and interference with the very many wifi networks around me. I decided to go wired so after I did a lot of research on how to get a wire from my second floor to first floor for the entertainment center. I bought a lot of tools from Fry's electronics and then after I started actually looking at what I had to do, I realized it would not be something I can do myself.  I called good guys electric and they came over and ran a couple of wires using CAT6 instead of the CAT5 I would have used through the (nail-ridden) attic and through walls without any wires sticking out while they kept away from the electrical wires to prevent interference.  I returned the tools and wire I got from Fry's electronics and that made the install very affordable.  I'm very happy with the quality of my network speed now, being able to stream HD content from my server upstairs to the TV 200 feet away.  After completing the network-wiring job, I had them install a new chandelier on a remote-controlled dimmer switch which was done quickly and works great

G-Star store is finally in Arizona but what a mess they are.  I purchased a lot of clothes from here as I like the g-star designs but recently I got a pair of expensive shorts expecting the great quality I'm used to with g-star products. Within a couple of weeks the shorts started falling apart so I took them back to the store.  One of the ladies at the store was plain rude accusing me of doing things illegally by trying to return and get a replacement for a bad product.  The other lady in the store was nicer but she told me that since they're a franchise they are not responsible for bad products but did offer to have them sent to get them fixed by some local tailor I assume. I agreed as they didn't give me any other choice.  A few weeks later they fixed a part of the shorts that ripped but one of the buttons they couldn't fix as if this wan't g-star at all.  Bottom line is they didn't offer to contact g-star for me or take a little responsibility and not be rude.  Other than this terrible experience, they often don't have sizes which is unacceptable for a flag-ship store.  Keep away.

Update: Originally had this at a 5 but...  The soup dumplings were amazing but lately they've been inconsistent. The outer shell tends to disintegrate before you even reach your mouth so all the soup spills out. Also inside of it there are clumps of fat that aren't dissolved so that tastes gross.  It's that bad that I now rarely order the dumplings.   Dough is made fresh every day, which is nice.  My new favorite thing on the menu is the szechuan chicken which is pretty delicious.  Drinks are beyond mediocre. Unfiltered sink tap water which tastes like dirt (they fixed this which is why I went back to 4 stars). No fountain drinks so they sell you cans of soda. No free refill, and since the water is undrinkable you get forced to drink a lot of that junk.

I really like this wine and cheese store. They always have great selection of pretty much everything I enjoy as far as cheese and meats goes. Spanish Chorizo, many different types of prosciutto, salami's, and of course cheese. My favorite is the reblochon but hold onto your hats if you've never had it because it's the stinkiest, tastiest thing I've had outside of France. Langres unfortunately is illegal in the US. Write to your congressman, tell them they are destroying the American dream of stinky cheese.  I also like their wine and beer selection. Lots of Arizona wines and they even have a Sangiovese I really enjoy.  While you're there, also check out the wall art, (I know shameless self-promotion) but I really creating art and hope more people get to see my fine art photography work. Some of the pieces I have hanging in there were taken in the valley, Hawaii, and all around the world.

First and foremost, where's the dance floor?   Service was pretty fast with getting me drinks but the quality of the drinks was terrible. Vodka cranberry tasted like something with cranberry syrup and the bartender gave me an attitude about how it's not his fault so it must be mine.  Packed with zombies in dress-code uniform and a long line. Revolver would have been a much better idea and it doesn't have a cover.

Was trying to grow some tomatoes from seed and had problems with the soil I got from home depot so I came to this store to get better soil but always was driven to buy something I didn't need or something that was just a replacement for what I was looking for but it never worked the way it was supposed to  The staff here convinced me to go hydro but didn't really prepare me for the problems you get from hydro.  I'm done trying to work with them. Growing my Russian heirlooms should not be THAT complicated if they would have just given me what I wanted from the beginning.   Homegrown Hydroponics in Tempe had much better inventory and now I even have the soil that I was looking for to begin with. The hydro setup I have will hopefully just make them grow fast but special solution was required to prevent pathogens. I had to get that from the Tempe store.  Wasted a few months and a bunch of money on equipment and soil I shouldn't have needed, therefore I can't recommend them to anyone.

This place is awful. It says hard rock but it's more like "we're running out of money, and by the way we're hitting rock bottom while censoring your speech rock". The AC was out today for many hours and the power went out randomly and then, while talking to my friends at the craps table, I was told I can't say Fuck. They are actually censoring my first amendment speech right! The hard rock is doing it! This country is going to shit along with these awful relics. FUCK this place!

Another Scottsdale shrine to douchebaggary.   I really hoped this would be a fun club with electronic music the Phoenix club scene is missing. Kind of like European summer clubs or Vegas pool clubs but as it turns out they are not about that. It is just another place to show off.  I find it difficult to believe that any respectable DJ would even want to play in this place.  They have 3 lines. One for VIP, one for regular admission, and another for what seemed to be to admit ugly burned out Scottscale cougars and their trouts.  The lines are unmarked so I ended up in the wrong line and was asked to go back in the regular line, which turns out is another hour of wait longer after they accept people in the "VIP" line, despite the place being empty at 10:30.  Seriously? Why would anyone want to go to a place where they just keep a line to seem busy?  The music inside was sub-par. Kind of commercial bullshit. Reminds me more of Jersey shore clubs than anything worth-while.

Gameplay is fun but horribly disorganized facility.  Bartenders are slow. We could have had 2 drinks before they even took our order.  No reservations taken unless you pay 50 dollars to skip queue, which we only found out late.   Half the bays were open yet we were made to wait 2 and a half hours, after which we left.  Drinks were good, once we got them, food was decent except for the chips, which were disgusting. Like Doritos without flavoring.  Music was awful.  Typical Scottsdale douche baggery, except with no sense of business and lame customer service.  Prices are also on the high end making the experience even worse.

This is a very fun place. Until last week I haven't been here in a few years and I really don't know why because I've been to so many places which aren't fun.  Last week went there for a birthday and they really know how make it fun.  They also let me take my semi-pro camera in, which a lot of bars/clubs in town allow, despite everyone having phone cameras, which doesn't prevent people from taking pictures, it just reduces the type of pictures that can be taken to mediocre.
