This is one of my favourite spots in Tempe. The staff is friendly and the food is excellent. I highly recommend the Thai Hummus as I have never been disappointed. If you go with the giant plate of nachos I was recently turned on to the fact that they are best with the blackened chicken on top. The bar is the best place to sit as all of their food is available at the bar and their bartenders are top notch. I often sit out on the patio as well and it is my experience that the waitstaff is not as knowledgeable as the bartenders and I have had disappointing service from them a few times as well. I go to the 8th Street Ale as my beer of choice but the RAJ IPA is also excellent and I recommend trying it if you see it on cask!

We were double billed and the service was horrible. We sat on the patio and were completely ignored for 15 minutes until my husband got up and got our beers at the bar. The table next to us seemed to have no trouble getting them tobring their drinks however. Perhaps they were friends with the staff?  I've been here for dinner before as well and while the food is decent I'm not overly impressed. Having been to my fair share of Irish pubs in Ireland this is not a good representation. It is definately an American idea of an Irish pub and it is appropriately overpriced for the "tourists". I'll go to the pub down the street for better service and a true Irish feel from now on.

I had heard good things about this place in passing and so purchased a Groupon to try it out. So the 5 wine tasting and an appetizer for two.  We arrive aroung 5:30 on a Thursday night and again the place is empty, so you'd think we'd have no trouble getting good service. Wrong!  Three people working and no eye contact. Our server didn't offer any comments on the wines we chose- like what it might pair with, where the grapes were sourced, any charecteristics it had... I'm not a wine snob but I have done many a wine tasting and you usually get some sort of interaction from the person pouring and some information on what your tasting. She did mention how much she liked the goat chesse and cinnamon stuffed dates but that ended our conversation except for one word answers to our questions.  She even left before we were through our tasting and didn't tell us or the next server...ugh.  We ended up purchasing an additional appetizer, (warm brie served with Triscuts, seriously?) so we planned on spending money...might have even bought a glass of wine after the tasting had the service or atmosphere been inviting. I will not be back for any reason.  If they can't serve 2 people at the bar properly how can they do big wine making parties right?

This place has recently broken away from the franchise and gone out on its own as "The Hungry Monk".  They imporved their menu and added a few interesting items. Can you say "Gyro Quesadilla"? I think you should, it is great!  Last time I was in I had the grilled chicken street tacos which were very tasty, the tortillas just needed a couple seconds on the flat top to get warmed up a bit.   For $7.50 you get four tacos with salsa and sour cream, I needed a to go box.  The wings are still awesome and the blue cheese dressing is drinakble. I could have that on everything. The staff is very friendly and made a point of learning our names and when James bartends he always points out what is new on tap and makes suggestions for us.   Sunday Football is great and all the local craft beers are only $3. This is very quickly becoming my favorite local bar.  The only times I would go somewhere else is during UFC fight nights, but that is cause I can't stand UFC.

I noticed I needed to update this review.  The Hungry Monk is by far the best place to have craft beers and great service in Chandler.  Jim does an outstanding job with his craft beef selection and there is always something new on tap. I was just in for lunch yeseterday and visited twice on Monday. (Hot Scotchy-wow!)  I cannot say enough good things about the beer and service at this very wonderful neighbourhood pub.

Just had a fantastic dinner here.  It was Taco Tuesday so I tried one chicken and one shredded beef taco. The meat was marinated and slow cooked to moist, juicy perfection.  Oh, and the chips and salsa were perfect. The chips were light and crispy and the salsa had just the right amount of heat with a wonderful fresh tomato and smokey flavor. Yummy chips, salsa and $2 tacos and beer? Yep, my new favorite mexican restaurant. One last thing, the service was great! Ramon was friendly and made great recomendations, plus he kept asking about refils and freash beers. This place is well worth a look.
