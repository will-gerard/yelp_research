The owners and staff at Il Vinaio are simply great.  Yesterday, they helped Ginnie & I host a 65th birthday party for about 40 people.  The ambiance was superb, the wine was wonderful, and the staff was exceptional.  We highly recommend Il Vanaio for a week-end brunch or dinner any time.

For the past 12 years Mountain Fresh Water has provided my RO system and serviced it annually.  We couldn't be more pleased.  The owner, Glenn, and his son, Hunter, are both highly knowledgeable professionals in the field of water purification and delivery services.  And they are easy to work with - good people.

That quaint Gilbert eatery & bar formerly known as The Groves Bar & Grill is under new ownership and calling itself M-Jays.  The potential is still there, but not until the new owners and staff complete what is going to be a looooong learning curve.  Having eaten brunch at M-Jays several times since the new owners took over, today we expected the same food and service when we arrived at 11:40.  After having to ask for water & coffee from the busboy, and later menus as well, we ordered brunch about 11:55.  At 12:03 our '3 days experienced' waiter informed us that brunch wasn't being served (despite the contrary signage out front), but that the manager was going to "comp" us with lunch for their error.  Disappointed, I ordered a burger and my wife ordered a pasta dish.  At 12:20 the chef (with the term used in its broadest sense) came out to say pasta was only available at dinner (and yet, it was on the menu we were provided).  She ordered a salad.  At 12:35 our food arrived.  My "Sonoran" burger had less guacamole than what's left on sides of the bowl after mixing it, and although the meat was over-cooked, the bun was cold.  Add to that the lukewarm French fries (that tasted reheated) and you have a meal was less than mediocre.  But at this point, the food was the victim of the poor service and very loud crowd of 15 millennials that had arrived and were seated immediately next to us.  We may try again in the spring in the hope that, if this restaurant survives the winter, the staff will have learned the basics of service and food preparation.
