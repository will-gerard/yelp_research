There is no reason to make an appointment with this business. EVERY time I have shown up with an appointment time, on time, they clearly will take walk ins ahead of you. And make you wait. This is not ok when you have nothing to do but your nails. They offer no reason why and leave it up to the people waiting to decide who is next by yelling ...."who's next?" When you have an appointment that has passed over 25 minutes ago. It's very frustrating. After this happening the last 3 times I have made an appointment, I will not return. I never have 30 mins to waste bc of their poor management.

It's just hard to give them anything less.  They have the best patio in Scottsdale.  They are always open.  I can usually get a table without a reservation or too long of a wait, or we figure out a spot in the non reserved patio area (which is where i want to be anyway). The food is always consistent. And these guys care...service is always awesome. There must be a no-attitude policy with their servers bc they are always pleasant.  I'm a fan of the med-salad and i add salmon and often will split if i'm there with a girlfriend.  it's the perfect meal and a bottle of cab.  The wines are priced very reasonably.  It's a great neighborhood spot.  PS: Their bloody mary's are really good too.

This is just a special place.  I've worked with animal rescue and know the hard work it takes just on a small scale.  This place goes overtime, all the time. The animals are cage free so your kitties are socialized.  The dogs living in mini living rooms. I really love it and try to give them anything they need from $ to anything on their "Needs List".  I think it's by appointment only. However, if you email Kelly (from the website), she'll arrange to meet you for donations, or pet introductions, or to say, "hello". Anyway, NO KILL (HUGE BONUS) CAGE FREE (GIGANTIC BONUS) BIG LOVING and DEDICATED HEARTS  behind the scenes (SUPER KEY).  It's a beautiful place, like no other shelter.
