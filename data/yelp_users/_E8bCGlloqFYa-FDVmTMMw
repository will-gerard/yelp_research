They show genuine enthusiasm for their work and love of animals. I have been using their services for my two dogs since moving into the neighborhood about six years ago and couldn't imagine going anywhere else. They doctors and staff are always very friendly and make my dogs and I feel at ease. They also have a great staff that handles the boarding area. Just make sure to double check drop off times...especially on holidays.

This has been our neighborhood go-to restaurant when we want something predicable--great drinks, delicious and filling food, and friendly service. Ajo Al's has never let us down. Love the tacos Miranda & the skinny margaritas for something a little on the lighter side.

Sushi was average & choices extremely limited. Drinks watered down. Atmosphere and decor are tops

Haven't been to a best buy in years because I always had poor customer service. Today was sadly no different. The store was mostly empty and there were plenty of employees around, but nobody came by and offered to help us find what we were looking for while we wondered aisle to aisle.

Friendly service but food was just ok. Maybe an off night.

The staff is super friendly and helpful. The food is great and out quickly. Coffee is always hot & tasty! This is our go-to breakfast spot! Plus you can sub almost anything, including egg whites, for no extra charge. They're very accommodating, especially for those of us who have to eat gluten free. So happy we found First Watch!

They are great with my two big dogs. We can't get them to stop squirming when we try to cut their nails, but the folks at Claws & Paws make it seem easy. Our dogs actually love coming here.

Walked around the store for 10 minutes with no acknowledgement from the staff. There was no other customer in the store. Only person to say hello was the mover guy who was putting together a bed frame. Stuff seems nice...on higher end of price range. I'd be willing to pay extra for quality goods, however, if it includes decent customer service. This place, at least today, didn't offer that.

They do an amazing job of helping bring ideas to print. Very precise work and just great people. This will be the second time our sports group/charity, Arizona Firefighter Athletics, has worked with Acme and we couldn't be happier. They truly provide the best work for the best price around. We wouldn't trust our designs to anyone else.

I realize I'm a güera but making me wait 20 minutes for tortillas while you serve everyone else is not cool. Especially when I hear you say I can wait. Entiendo español. Too bad because the pan dulce and gorditas looked legit.

Everyone who works there is always very friendly. The produce is usually perfectly ripe and inexpensive. You can get great deals on organic products including meat. Their store version of products are amazing...huge fan of their greek yogurt. It doesn't carry a ton of products but it's good for those who don't want a ton of processed foods or just want to eat simply and healthfully.

They do not allow pit-bulls, pit mixes, or dogs that display similar characteristics! Do not support this company if they are willing to perpetuate stereotyping of dogs.

Can't customize and the smoothie I got lacked flavor. Plus it took forever and was expensive.

Poorly organized, dirty, and crappy selection of everything. Not really much redeeming about this store. Sad even for a Walmart.

Not my favorite one stop just because it always feels cramped. Staff is hit or miss, sometimes they act like I'm bothering them being there even if I'm the only customer other times are super friendly. Can't beat the convenience of stopping there on my way out of town though.

So chalking up last couple experiences to going in during lunch when there's a crowd. Morning crew is super chill and helpful. Great tips and ideas on how to reach my goals. For quick fix the place is always my go to...will just remember to go in early if I need help picking out supplements.

This place had really gone downhill since I bought my car two years ago. The prices have gone up, they no longer offer reasonable deals for loyal customers, the car wash is broken half the time, and the lounge area leaves a lot to be desired...coffee is old and stale, no tea, no snacks. This used to be a much better place...too bad the manager doesn't care about his customers.

So happy we found this place! Went because I had heard they have gluten free options and a great selection of wine. We were not disappointed! The food was excellent from the prosciutto of the appetizer down to the last bite of limoncello sorbet. The wine was a perfect pairing as well. Numerous members of the staff checked in with us without seeming to overbearing. We will definitely be back.

Love this place. They are very friendly and skilled. Plus who doesn't love a place where they remember you even though you only come in at most once a month. The prices are great too and include what most places charge extra for--hot stone massage, neck message, callus removal.

Been meaning to try this place for a while now. So glad we finally did! Great food for a great price and so many options! You can mix up the fillings or get extra on the side for only a buck. The chicken was juicy and delicious. We will be back...and soon!

Family owned and local option to get decently priced healthy (they screen everything before putting it on the shelves!) for your mutts! The staff is incredibly friendly and knowledgeable. They have pet perk type rewards so you can get eventually get a bag of food for free or get money off if you're only buying treats or accessories. Oh and did I mention they give free samples?!

Acme Prints is my go-to printing/shirt company in the Valley. They've taken care of my team/charity Arizona Firefighter Athletics for the last four years. We know that we'll get the best quality shirts and great customer care along the way. Thanks Acme!
