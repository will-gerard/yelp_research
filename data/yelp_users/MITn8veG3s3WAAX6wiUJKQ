Great little find!  I have driven by this place a gazillion times and finally stopped in yesterday for a late breakfast.  I had the skinny scramble. Egg whites, feta, spinach, mushrooms and tomatoes over a smaller size portion of the country potatoes.  YUMMY!  Huge menu with lots of choices.....I will definitely go back to sample other menu items!!

Extremely disappointed with this place.....was looking forward to "Beat the Heat -- Arizona Winterfest" at The Venue Scottsdale last Saturday, but as other reviewers have mentioned...it was quite simply a disaster.  No A/C. No A/C. No A/C.  Enough said.  I did at least get my money back.

There's no better place in Old Town than the Blue Moose for a beer (or several in my case) before and after a Giants Spring Training game.  We hit the Moose on Saturday and we had a blast!  Great people, good bar food and a cutie bartender.  Plus the Giants beat the Dodgers.  What more can a die hard Giants fan ask for?  Love it!

Gorgeous setting and wonderful food!  I had "BLT Revival".  It was amazing!  The cornmeal-fried green tomatoes were an excellent touch and I couldn't get enough of the lemon-basil aoli.

Bungalow is a Scottsdale staple and I have been going here for years.  Great vibe, good food (um, have you had the grilled cheese??), and terrific patio!  I recently discovered the Bungalow Juice on their Cocktail menu and it is my new favorite drink.  Love Bungalow!

What  a great lunch spot!  I ordered the Yellow Curry dish and with it came a bowl of ginger rice soup, an eggroll, side of rice and some wonton chips - all for $6.95.  The curry was delicious - full of flavor!  I will definitely go back.

I've been under the weather the last few days and all I have been wanting is some yummy Pho.  Saigon Nights is too far north for me, so I decided to try this place since it is close to where I live.    For the last two nights, I have ordered the Chicken Pho for takeout and both nights it has been delicious!   A flavorful broth that's not too salty.  I also had the Arizona Fried Rice, which was excellent.  A little oily, but that's what makes fried rice so good.  I ordered it because it did not have peas in it - can't stand peas!  I will definitely go back to Noodles Ranch!

Time for an update to my original review!  Since trying this place a few months ago, I have been back SEVERAL times (I am on my second Loyal Customer Card).  I seriously must get take out from here at least once a week.  The Chicken Pho is still scrumptious and delightful and I crave it quite often.  The staff is so friendly too!  Noodles Ranch is a gem in the desert so stop by and try them soon.

Due to the terrible service we experienced, I should give this place 1 star but the food was delicious so I'm giving it 2 stars.  Four of us went here on our lunch break.  Note to self and others, do not go to this place if you are pressed for time!!  Our waitress had no idea what she was doing and messed up 2 of the 4 orders at our table.  We were never offered anything to drink besides water and had to ask several time for plates once our food arrived.  And trying to separate our payment was simply too much for her to handle.  I will say my chicken tikka masala was absolutely delicious and is one of the best I have had in Arizona.  They do charge extra for rice, which I find odd.  The best part of ordering Indian food is pouring the sauce over rice.  The naan was excellent too!  The terrible service and extremely long wait time for our food as well as our check was unacceptable, so I don't see us going back.

Everyone loves Sprinkles Cupcakes, but now I REALLY do!  We ordered some as a Thank You gift for another department and they were supposed to arrive at 1pm.  Around 1:15pm, I decided to follow up to see where the courier was.....within 5 minutes I received a call back from Order line letting me know he was very busy and unfortunately running behind but that he would be here in 20 minutes.  With three minutes I received a call from Lauren, the store manager in Scottsdale, apologizing for the delay and said they would comp the delivery fee of $35!  Talk about GREAT Customer Service!!  Yay Sprinkles!  Yummy Cupcakes as well as fantastic customer service!

Delicious sushi...very creative rolls...however, the service was slow...and disappointed with the skimpy wine pours!  Come on...for $9 a glass, there should be more than 6 sips in a glass.  Just sayin.

First off, I must say that YC's is hands down, THEEE best Mongolian BBQ in the Valley.  With that said, I work on the West side of town and often wish their was a YC's over here to satisfy my stir fry craving at least once a week.  After searching Yelp, I came across Sir Fry Paradise and decided to give it a try.  The ingredients were fresh and tasty and I like the additional items they offered at the other buffet bar (sweet and sour pork, wontons, etc).  However, it would be helpful if they listed the recipes for the sauces at the end like YC's does, for those that don't know what sauces to put together.  I have been to YC's hundreds of times so I knew what to do, but my co-worker was a little lost.  Leftovers are not allowed so be prepared to eat what you put in your bowl!  Overall, it is delicious!  I have been back a few times and will continue to go to Stir Fry Paradise for lunch.

Best Bloody Mary's!  And if you haven't tried the Turkey Pastrami on a Pretzel roll with cole slaw, you are MISSING OUT!

First time visiting the Grind and I was impressed.  I had the Steak BLT burger and it was fantastic!  It must have something to do with how they cook it in the coal-burning oven because it was juicy, well seasoned and cooked to perfection.  It was huge and I had to use a knife and fork to eat it but no complaints there.  I will definitely go back for another burger!

Citizen Public House is simply amazing!  I went there last night with a friend and we loved it!  Cool place with a great vibe.    I normally drink red wine when I go out but last night I decided to step out of my comfort zone (thanks to one very knowledgeable and helpful bartender) and try a cocktail.  Thank goodness I did!  The Moe'scow Mule was fantastic and exactly what I wanted.  I told him I didn't like sweet drinks and he picked the right one for me.  Vodka, ginger beer, lime and cucumber.  It  was refreshing and delightful.    Next up comes some little samplings of their flavored tequila courtesy of that same bartender. Now that is what I call great service!  I actually don't like tequila but these were actually decent.    Choosing what to order for din din was difficult because everything sounded great!  I decided to go for the AZ BLT which had bacon, Campari tomato, and greens all on caramelized French bread with some sort of mayo heaven on it.  O-M-G!  It was by far the most delicious, perfect BLT I have ever had!  Seriously....I couldn't get enough.   After dinner, Richie the Mixologist came over to us and my friend asked about a Bananas Foster drink she had over at the old Estate House.  Richie said he would make us HIS Bananas Foster drink to see what we thought.  Next thing you know he is lighting things on fire with a blow torch and mixing it all up.  Wow!  Quite a show and the finished product was heaven.  The perfect ending to a wonderful experience.  The staff is very knowledgeable and passionate about their restaurant and it shows.  So warm and welcoming!  Citizen Public House is a diner's dream and I can't wait to go back to try everything else on the menu.  If you haven't been, you are truly missing out!!!

Love this place!  We have stopped in here quite a few times since they have opened and always have a good time.  It seems to be our Sunday Funday destination!  The bar staff is friendly and personable (we love Heather, Ashley and Dan).  The food is unique (sort of like upscale campfire food) and delicious.  Oh and Bonfire has THE BEST MACARONI AND CHEESE in town!  Hot and bubbly, a Vermont White Cheddar mac and cheese that comes out in a mini cast iron skillet.  It is simply amazing!  I tried the Pecan Grilled Harris Ranch Burger last night for the first time and it was fantastic.  Very juicy and tasty!  Hands down one of the best burgers I have had in Scottsdale.

I'm not sure why this place has received so many bad reviews?  I went there last night for the first time and had a very pleasant experience.  I had a glass (or two or three) of the Malbec which was excellent and came out perfectly chilled.  I love when places serve chilled red wine!   My friend and I shared the bisquit cheese appetizer thingy which was tasty, but the portion size could of been larger.  They were swimming in a delicious cheese sauce that we kept to later use on the Quinoa side.   The Quinoa was FABULOUS!  It was served cold with some sort of fresh herb and had a lemony bite to it.  It was amazing!  We also shared the BBQ Chicken sandwich was was good but nothing that special.  The bartender was very nice and engaging too!  I will definitely go back again.

What a great find!  I live close by and decided to stop in for lunch.  The Chicken Walnut Salad sandwich was incredible...very tasty.  Huge sandwich!  The Ahi Tuna Salad was delightful, with a yummy miso vinaigrette and crunchy wasabi peas.  I will definitely go back to try dinner!

I was very sad to see Iruna go, but was very excited to learn about Aaron's new concept.  I went there last Saturday and it didn't disappoint!  I had the Burrata salad and it was amazing!  The pesto vinaigrette was delicious.     I can't wait to go back again and try other dishes.....quite a menu and beer list!

Impressive beer list (Delirium Tremens on tap!), delicious brats (I had the Spicy, friend had the Thai Chicken), and amazing fries with oh-so-not-healthy-but-oh-so-yummy dipping sauces. Our waiter Chris was friendly, funny and took great care of us!  Looking forward to going back.   PS. Beer prices are definitely Scottsdale prices though, so that's why I gave 4 stars.

I have been here twice now and have been pleased both times.  The first time, I met a few girlfriends for dinner and we sat up at the bar.  Nice atmosphere and the bartenders were friendly.  We ordered the focaccia di recco (focaccia with cheese and honeycomb), which was excellent!  We then shared the Farro salad and Strozzapre  Amatriciana, which had a spicy red sauce.  Very good!  Great wine selection too.    The second time, I stopped by after work on day on the way home to have a glass of wine and a salad.  After some discussion with the bartender, he suggested I try the mascarpone polenta and ragù of the day (it was a bolognese).  DELICIOUS.  A little rich but absolutely delicious!

I've been looking forward to this opening since Zen 32 closed. They did a great job on the build out and the bar area is fantastic!  Very modern and I love how open and bright it is...perfect for this time of the year.  I have been there twice now and have been impressed.  The Arancini was delicious as well the chicken wings. I will definitely return!!
