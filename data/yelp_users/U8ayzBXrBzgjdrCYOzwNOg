I give the Desert Botanical Gardens 4 out of 5 stars, only because they just aren't the same as they used to be :( My hubby and I were married there almost 6 years ago, so we've always had a special attachment to the Gardens, and have been members ever since.   The paths are lovely- really a nice way to spend the day getting fresh air and sunshine, soaking up the amazingly lush succulents and cacti, bunnies, birds, and other animals. The butterfly pavilion is also a treat when its in season, and a lot of the festivals and classes are great, as are the changing art exhibits (can't wait to see the  Chihuly exhibit!!).  The only thing that disappoints me is how freakin expensive it has gotten! I am totally not cheap, and I am all about supporting the non-profits, but the cost of events and memberships has gone up and up an up every year. I start to wonder how the average family could enjoy the Gardens? We love the Agave on the Rocks and Luminarias events, but we may or may not go this year because the prices have just gotten outrageous, even at member-pricing. It seems like most of the mailers we get these days are highlighting their fundraising activities and we recently got hammered with calls during a fundraising campaign. I totally get it, its just  a turn off to hear SO MUCH about the fundraising. It just seems like they have become more preoccupied with raising funds than adding value for visitors lately.  I still love it here, a beautiful place that holds special meaning to us. Its great to bring family, out of town visitors or for dates.

Went for the first time yesterday for lunch. It was soooo good! There is a wine / beer bar adjacent to the main retail / deli area. Lots of unique gifts,  artisanal cheeses and more! I was amused that they take your lunch order on a brown bag and put your lunch in it. Had an excellent roast beef sandwich and sat out front (note for summer: they only have outdoor seating). Clean, friendly and delicious, check it out!

I cannot say enough wonderful things about Kinesphere, and owner Dominika. She recently lead a private class for my monthly women's group, kindly opening the studio late to us and allowing our group to bring in refreshments.  Upon walking in the door to see a welcome note to my group on their lobby chalkboard, we immediately left the outside world behind us. The studio is gorgeous, clean, comfortable and peaceful. Dominika instructed us on "relax and release" techniques, expertly demonstrating the use of foam rollers and other equipment for stress relieving stretches.  Dominika welcomed our questions during the demonstration and easily managed to correct and assist the entire group that evening so that we each had a great (and valuable) experience. I have gotten great feedback from all of our attendees on our visit.   The staff at Kinesphere have their priorities straight, they made each of us (with varying degrees of experience and different fitness levels) comfortable. I will definitely be returning to Kinesphere and highly recommend it.

I had a great experience here and will definitely be back. I have had some lackluster experiences lately and decided to try something new. The atmosphere is nothing special, the only reason they got 4 stars instead of 5- it is your run of the mill nail salon, but my nail tools were taken out of an autoclave in plain view- big points for that. The service was friendly and the prices are very fair- I was excited to try shellac on my nails for the first time and was very pleased with both the polish job on my toesies and the shellac on my fingers. Twan did an incredible job- I can't remember a time in the past when my mani/pedi was treated like anything other than a rush job to get me out the door and the next person in my chair. Twan took the time to do a quality job and it shows. I definitely recommend Paradise and will be back soon.

I totally love this place. It reminds me of the old school hardcore Chinese restaurant my parents used to take us when we were kids :D   The decor is amazing- unlike more Chinese places in Phoenix. The walls are a teal blue, adorned with large carved pieces of artwork depicting scenes in China, golden dragons and more. The lights hanging from the ceiling are amazingly ornate. The place looks like its from a bygone era (doesn't help that its in a run down strip mall) but it is clean and charming inside.  The service was great- kind to our 2 yo, and very attentive. The food was the best part- I can't remember the last time I had such good Chinese food, and it's priced very reasonably. We got the Peking dinner for 2 which included the fried noodles, hot tea, wonton soup (with generous noodles, meat, shrimp and veggies, the best I've ever had), a pupu platter with eggrolls, bbq skewers, house wings and those cheese puff thingies (the presentation is pretty cool, too). Next came 3 entree sized plates of food: mongolian beef, fried chicken (can't remember the name) and the Peking fried rice. The meal concluded with incredible little desserts- sort of like eggrolls but filled with banana and then covered with crystalized honey. I could have eaten 100 of them! Adding in a beverage and tax, the meal was only $34!   My 2 yo can really eat, so I am surprised and pleased to say that even with sharing the dinner for 2 people with him, the 3 of us walked out with lots of leftovers. Highly recommended. Do it! DO IT!

This place is totally awesome. Hubby found it on Yelp this morning and so glad we gave it a try! It is located in a sleepy stripmall behind a Starbucks and Gelado Spot, so I am guessing a lot of people don't know its there.  It is small but they are big on friendliness. The waitresses are the fun no-nonsense type with great senses of humor and are very attentive. We were poured cup after cup of hot fresh coffee and they were very sweet to our little boy. Even the other patrons were sweet, saying hello to him and giving him a smile.  The food was out of this world- we got a nice big pancake, scrambled egg and sausage patty for our son who ate the WHOLE thing! I got the machaca and eggs and it was one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. The machaca was seasoned perfectly and had nice big pieces of bell pepper and onions, and was covered with eggs and chunky salsa. It also came with nice big chunks of chargrilled new potato homefries! So good!  It was so much food, I had to take half of it home, but it wound up being my lunch. Most of the dishes range from $6-$9 and they offer lunch and dinner all day long. This is a great place to bring your family, they are great with kids and we were in and out of there in under an hour. Highly recommended!

Went here for breakfast with Hubby and Little Man today. I can't say enough how much we love this place! Even when there's a wait, you don't have to wait too long and the service is very good. The regulars are friendly with our son and the food is awesome! I usually get the machaca and eggs, or a tuna melt on a bagel. They have the best fries ever! The kids' meals are inexpensive, they bring crayons and paper, and give them cookies at the end of the meal. Couldn't ask for more!

Very disappointing experience.   Looking for a place for my dad. Went in on a Saturday and they were closing early (10 minutes after we arrived) so they were in a rush. J. at the front desk gave us an application and insisted that they needed a money order to hold the apartment for my dad, felt like she couldn't get us out of there fast enough.   Returned on Monday morning and gave the completed application and money order to O., who apparently is the manager, not that identified herself as such while we were there. She actually did not tell us much of anything, except at the very end, she told us it was Affordable Housing. I have no idea what that means, and it isn't posted anywhere in their office or stated anywhere on the application paperwork. I literally have no context for what the means in that moment or that he needed to qualify for his apartment.  Later in the week I called to find out when we could get into the apartment and waited on hold for almost 10 minutes (not like "oh it was a long hold", like it was literally 9 minutes and change that I sat on hold). Apparently my dad had made some errors on the application and they gave his apartment away - no one called us, no one notified my dad that he'd have no place to move into 3 short days later and there are no other apartments for him in the complex. That was it, they just gave it away and didn't bother to tell us until I called.  I emailed them 2 days after that asking them to mail my money order back. Today I sat on hold for 11 minutes to find out it still hasn't been mailed.   Above is all fact, now for my opinion: The people who work here are miserable, careless and disconnected, going through their job duties like apathetic robots, and I feel dismayed that our tax dollars subsidize this place. Don't bother with this place, get a roommate, look for other Affordable Housing options, whatever you need to do. This place has bad energy, not worth it, no matter how cheap it is.

I actually really like this Albertson's- it's the nicest one I've been in. It is big and their selection has improved with the addition of an organic / natural foods section (wish I could get my Ian's Frys there if you read this Albertsons!). Their prices do seem a bit higher to me than some of the other area stores, but I am guessing it is due to being located in a large high end shopping center.  The service has always been good. There is a guy at the butcher counter that has been there since they opened who is as friendly and helpful as can be (wish I knew his name, sorry). Also, I ordered my son's birthday cake from this location a week ago and it was great! They had a huge selection of photo cakes and well know character designs. I got one made of cupcakes covered with a Lightning McQueen design and it was a big hit!  Great store, good selection, big, clean, well lit and nice employees. Makes it worth the price.

Spent several months trying to find a great rheumatologist on my insurance. This practice recently moved their offices and I think were bought by another company (?) so maybe that is responsible for a better experience than the other reviewers have had here on Yelp.   I have been trying to find a great doctor, no easy feat, and I was a bit skeptical when I first arrived and the woman at the front desk kept me waiting, but after she called over she warmed up a bit. I was called back very quickly and the nurse who took my vitals was extremely pleasant and assured me I'd love Dr Taddei (online reviews refer to her as Dr Carminoti, which looks to be a hyphenated name from info at the office).   The doctor came in and I was immediately pleasantly surprised. She went through my entire RA history and ordered new x-rays and blood work, and asked me about my family history and some other things she noticed from my previous doctors notes and records. She sat facing me (crazy, I know, but my previous doctor always sat facing away from me at her computer and rarely looked at me or made eye contact), offered her thoughts and opinions and was happy to provide any explanations I needed. I could barely hold back from hugging her and telling her she could never retire.   The wait time for the Dr to come into the room could've been shorter, but overall it was a very good visit and I'm feeling fortunate to have found a great doctor again.

I love this place! Took my son yesterday morning. It is always clean and well organized. You can make a day of this park with so much to do! The park's hours vary with the season but typically opens at 10am. Purchase your ride at the front office as you're walking in.  The park has a fun train ride, carousel, a HUGE playground and large open fields with several ramadas for parties. You can bring in your own food for a picnic or get lunch (things like chili, pizza, pb & j) just north of the train station or visit the snack bar near the carousel (ice cream, candy, popcorn, chips, coffee beverages).   The prices are very reasonable, especially for ramada rental. Visit, you will love this place!

We had a terrific experience here with Dr. Soltero.   We were a bit nervous about taking our great big 12 year old Belgian Malinois to a vet's office - her entire life, she was seen by a recently-retired vet that made house calls. We looked on Yelp and saw that Saguaro was in our city and had great reviews, so we made an appointment since our dog's back legs seemed to be giving her trouble.   The place is very clean and most of the staff were friendly. We did not have to wait long to see Dr. Soltero, who was kind and soft spoken. His assistant was also great with our dog and friendly with us. He gave our dog a thorough exam and helped us to consider several possible causes of her leg pain and prospective treatments. He knew what each course of action would cost, and helps us to weigh our options. In the end we chose the conservative option of treating her first with an anti-inflammatory, and we saw some improvement almost right away.   She's since been back for a follow up appointment, which was also a quick one, and Dr. Soltero called himself and left us a message about the blood work results.   Overall we were extremely pleased with our experience and will return when our pets need care.

Broke my shoe and dropped by in between appointments. Stood at counter with credit card in hand, ready to check out and was totally ignored by the one person you have working at this location as she researched something for another customer. When I went to leave she said "I can only help one person at a time." If she'd just acknowledged me at any point before that I would've completed my purchase. A disappointing waste of time.

Met with Stephen and Adrian today at Lavidge's office, along with my client (they are doing my client's site and blogs). I was totally impressed at their professionalism, humor and knowledge. They do their research and know their stuff, great staff, beautiful office.

Just called to try to make a new patient appointment. I wait on hold on the automated system forever. The lady that answers picks up and immediately puts me on hold again. Shes comes back on and informs me that they are not able to book a new patient appointment until end of the month (now getting the distinct feeling they just don't care about booking appointments).  I tell her that's fine and that I'd like to come in for an annual check up. She tells me they don't do physicals. I say ok, I want to just meet the doctor, get lab work, whatever. She tells me they don't do labs on the first visit. I reiterate that I just want to come in and establish a relationship with a new family physician. She puts me back on hold, as in, she sits the phone down and I'm just listening to all the conversations happening in the office (um, HIPAA anyone?!).   She finally comes back, now almost 15 minutes into the call and she tells me that she talked to her manager and they don't just do "meet the doctor visits". I say, (yes, huffily) look, I'm just trying to make an appointment with a new doctor, she interrupts with "ma'am, excuse me!".   Um no.  How hard does this have to be? I just want an appointment. Good luck doctors, hope you didn't want any new patients.

This is SO my go to place for shoes! Went yesterday and got the hottest pair of red patent leather peep toe Cole Haan heels. They were originally $275 marked down to $99! Found the perfect pair but they're a bit tight? Purchase your shoes and take them back to the shoe counter- they'll stretch them for you for 24 hours at no charge.  The rest of the merch is pretty hit or miss. I sometimes find great bargains on handbags and jewelry but the makeup and bath items tend not to be priced very well (pretty average, not really "outlet pricing" on those items). You never know what you will find for clothes, sometimes things seem picked through, but once in a while you can really find a designer bargain. Highly recommended!

I love this place! We grew up at the Y in south FL, and my son is getting involved, too. It is definitely pricier than most gyms but you are supporting a place that doubles as a community center and place you can bring your kids! They have group fitness class, a huge pool, and swim lessons (my son goes every summer), a place you can drop the kids off when you're working out, a rec room, trainers, basketball, and all kinds of things. The smoothie bar and wi-fi is cool too (I wouldn't go there to work necessarily, but if you need it it's there)!   The swim lessons are what we do most  and we really enjoy them. The classes have gotten pretty big but its a nice pool and a great instructor. Really love it here :D

I love this place! It is an really cool old school Italian deli with the kinds of things my grandparents would have just loved- lots of imported groceries, gardineria, sweets and deli meats.   My absolute favorites are the Italian roast beef (great sub rolls!) and you must get the fresh mozzarella appetizer- half moons of crispy fried mozzarella served with marinara.

So glad I drove a little further to try a new place! Lee did a great job, she was friendly and chatty but still let me relax. The interior is beautiful and there was one person dedicated to sweeping and cleaning. The nail utensils Lee used came out of hermetically sealed packaging. And, I love my nails! This place has it together, will be back.

Our pediatrician is at Scottsdale Children's Group. We interviewed several doctors and offices before choosing one for our son and we really like them. We have experienced some billing issues  (they overbilled us for a very long time, didn't tell us and just started giving us credits instead of asking if we wanted a refund) and once they told us that we had no insurance coverage because my 2 year old reached his lifetime max (how does that even make sense?????).  But we've always gotten everything straightened out and whenever we need a last minute appointment or needed to talk to someone they are there. They have Saturday office hours and you can call a nurse 24 hours a day if your child has something going on. The office is bright and clean, the staff is nice and we really love Dr. Burke! We also like the other doctors we've seen when Dr. Burke was on vacation or unavailable.   Highly recommended!

So disappointed.   Rheumatologists aren't easy to find in the Valley, and most have negative patient reviews. I tried to make an apt with Dr Pace and was informed that she only opens her books a few times a year to schedule new patients, and that I'd have to put my name on a waiting list to be called back in 6 weeks.  6 weeks came and went, so I called back and was informed that now Dr Pace is taking leave and not opening her books to new patients at all (I get it, things happen, but how about some communication? You did just ask me to wait 6 weeks and now you leave me hanging).   I explained my situation to the receptionist on the phone, that I really need to see a new dr, and that I'd narrowed her down to being the dr I wanted to see for my RA. Was there anything she could do? Could she please talk to the dr and make an exception in my case?   She said she'd ask and call me back. Wait for it... Nope, several days later and no call back.

I wish I could give 10 stars!  A couple weeks ago after taking my son to the ER for headaches at another hospital, we were transferred to the pediatric ICU at St Joe's when we discovered he needed surgery to remove a large tumor from his brain. It was the start of a very very long stint in the hospital full of fear, and worry, but minimized pain and lots of help and recovery.  I can't overstate how amazing the staff are at St Joe's PICU. Our neurosurgeon, Dr Nakaji was just incredible- knowledgeable, down to earth, attentive, honest but reassuring and very, very talented. His residents and all the nurses were also amazing- they were so kind and helpful. Not once did I feel that they were "desensitized" to our situation, and they were very compassionate while anticipating our emotional needs and physical needs (we went in there unprepared for a long stay, they brought us toiletries, snacks, laundry detergent and more).   By all accounts, my son seems to be healthy now and I think we had the best possible circumstances of a bad situation thanks to St Joe's. I highly, highly recommend them!

This place is first class, I'd give them 10 stars! My son has been seeing Dr Peter Nakaji since his surgery in 2009. Every appointment is refreshingly smooth and quick (not the norm for visiting busy specialist) and Dr Nakaji is not only a vastly knowledgeable expert, he explains things in easy-to-understand terms and is wonderful with our little boy. The staff isn't always warm and fuzzy, but they are well organized and keep the office moving which is more than enough for me.   If you are in need of Neurosurgeon you will be in great hands with Dr Nakaji at Barrow, we love this guy!!

Had a terrific experience with Dr. Bonnin. He was kind and patient and had a lot of great information and tips for me - I need annual eye exams because of a medication I take, and I also work at the computer 8-10 hours a day which can cause strain. He understood the condition and the medication I take, the nature of my job, and he gave me sample eyedrops as well.   The office visit itself was pretty average, the staff weren't particularly friendly but not rude either. They were running behind just like every other medical office, but it wasn't horrible. I think from the time I checked in until the time I left I was there for a little over an hour. The place was busy but clean and fairly efficiently run.   One note - at first I was suspicious about the retina photography and paying extra for it, but I'm glad I did. It is actually really cool - instead of dilating the eye for the exam to look at the health of your inner eye, they do this photo that documents the entire inner eye. Dr. Bonnin showed me the images which show if you have issues with the macula, how the nerves look, etc. I don't have to do it every time, but in the future if I have problems he can compare a newer image with this last one he took to compare the two to detect changes. And I GLADLY paid the extra $30 to avoid dilating my eyes!  I really liked Dr. Bonnin and will definitely be back the next time I need an exam.

This is based solely on a phone call, not service, want to be clear.   Was very disappointed, I saw all these great reviews and had high hopes. I called to get more info (never had a pet groomed before) and the woman who answered immediately interrupted me at the start of the call. Rather than providing me with information about the business or services, she began qualifying me as a customer based on service area, pets, and began quoting me prices in a way that made me believe a lot of people probably turn her down based on price, rather than justifying to me why they are worth the cost.   I asked about scheduling and she informed me that she would need 3 hours for both our pets, but that she has no 3 hour blocks available. "Ever?" I asked. She said, well a few here and there in June and then we're on vacation in the first week of July. I said "ok, do you want to schedule us to do 2 separate appointments for shorter time slots?, I'm thinking work with me here lady, I feel like I'm asking her to do the biggest favor for me to take my business.   She asked for my address and then asked if we have a place to "plug in her van?", I told her again I'd never had this done before and what did that mean? She said well "we need x, y, z to do the job", at which point I said that it was ok, we'd figure something else out.   I have never before spoken to someone who has made it so immediately clear that they were not interested in my business.

We had the best time here! The atmosphere is great- very authentic decor, loved the belly dancer and the wait staff were funny and attentive! The food was also really good- its a 6 course pre fixe for $39.99. We had so much food left over we were sad we didn't have a fridge to put it in at the hotel. We started with shrimp scampi, then a tomato-lentil soup, a hummus platter with marinated vegetables and eggplant, followed by beef skewers served in a whole pineapple (these last 2 dished were my favorites), finished by a chicken, squash and cous cous dish topped off with a desert of phylo dough filled with fruits and nuts. It was seriously satisfying, delicious food!  If we lived in Vegas we'd be back. Our birthday girl had a blast and it made for a really fun night!

Went to Lux for the first time yesterday to grab a hot tea and get some work done. Overall, it was a great experience and I am looking forward to returning. The people who work there are pretty cool, they made me a couple great big mugs of hot tea and I had a crazy amazing brioche with huge chunks of sweet apples. awwww yeahhhh!  I would give it 5 stars but it is a bit on the pricey side, the atmosphere could be better and there are NO seats at lunchtime. I was standing around for a good 15 minutes like a jerk with my laptop waiting for someone to leave. It seems like they might be able to make more room but its hard to say what the rest of the building is used for.   At any rate, the best thing about this place isn't the place, or even the coffee and food- its the people. The employees are friendly and funny and the patrons are really, really cool. I met 2 people there I knew from Twitter who introduced me to another friend, who in turn introduced me to yet another person. There is a great buzz in this place, lots of people thinking, working and talking all fueled by caffeine. I had a ton of great conversation and thoroughly enjoyed myself. Looking forward to returning.

Had a very nice birthday dinner here and really, really enjoyed it. The atmosphere is simple and classic, it occurred to me that they were striving to feature the food with such simple ambiance, and they succeeded.   The service was fantastic, we had a team of servers for our party of 6 and we did not wait for a single thing throughout dinner. They did manage to find that balance between being attentive and hovering, it was perfect. Hubby and I had the table side prepared Cesar salad and it was excellent. For dinner I had the rare filet and I really enjoyed it, and the table shared the grits (my personal favorite of the entire dinner), spinach and mushrooms. For desert we had the peppermint profiteroles, which were so so (I'm not a big peppermint fan though).   I really enjoyed dinner and highly recommend it for a nice dinner in Vegas.

This is one of my favorite restaurants for many reasons! The service is fantastic- Roberto, the owner, and his wife Susan are often at the restaurant, greeting guests and going table to table. Reservations are recommended (especially if you are going on a Fri or Sat night in season), if you call ahead ask for Wanda. She is friendly and attentive, as is all the staff. The prices are very reasonable- you will get a meal on par with Mastro's or Flemings for half the price. You can't go wrong with their fresh pastas or seafood, homemade garlic sausages and wonderful desserts (love the semifredo!). They have consistently served fantastic food for the years my hubby and I have been going. The wine list is extensive, you'll be sure to find a favorite that won't break the bank, and don't forget to end your meal with an espresso or limencello. The atmosphere is great- relaxing, intimate, a place where you can talk with and enjoy the people with you. Also, don't miss the monthly wine dinners in summer- they serve new dishes that aren't on the menu and are very generous with the pours.

The Greene House hit the spot last night- its hard to get hubby to try new places and honestly we've been budget conscious about going out to eat lately, so we really want to make sure we'll go someplace we'll really enjoy. Luckily, hubby liked it, and we were happy with our experience.  I only give this place 4 stars because they aren't kid friendly (a little pricey and no kids' options on the menu), and the service was pretty slow, but even at that, the server was very friendly. We sat out on the patio as the sun was going down- the place had a nice atmosphere and it was just nice to sit, people watch and enjoy the weather. We started with the herbed hummus and I got the twin Kobe burgers with fries- they were pretty decent, nothing out of the ordinary. However, hubby got the mahi tacos and they were outstanding, as was the side of mac cheese we got for my son.   I don't think I'd order the same food, but I would definitely go again for a date night!

I hardly ever get downtown for lunch and had no idea where to go, so I sent out a tweet. A couple people independently suggested Cibo, so we met friends there. The place is very a charming, a converted house with brick wall, chandeliers, and cool art.   They serve sandwiches and salads at lunch time. I got the pastrami and mostly enjoyed it. It was actually a little too rich with the fontina for my liking, but overall pretty good. The bread was toasty and incredible.   The staff was great- nice, genuine and friendly. I love when servers know how to strike the balance of being attentive while giving you time to talk with your company.  Last, but best, we ordered dessert crepes. This is where the 5th star comes in- oh my freaking god. We got a suzette which has orange marmalde folded in and is topped with gran marnier which they light at the table. We also got one stuffed with warm nutella and topped with powedered sugar. It was absolute freaking ecstasy on a plate. Let me tell you- if you ever have a hot date, or an apology to make, do it over wine and dessert crepes at Cibo.

After our team yoga class we had our staff meeting at Drip this week. Gina is totally awesome, and they were super accomodating. Matt at Sutra Midtown Yoga (next door to Drip) let them know we'd be over afterwards and they had tables and chairs pulled together in the semi private space in the north part of their place.  Gina is dynamic and attentive, and the food was was especially enjoyable. Matt had talked up the NY egg sandwich and it didn't disappoint- I had mine with an over hard egg, Boar's Head bacon and tomato. The home fries were some of the best I've had. If you're in the neighborhood and looking to support a cool local place (and you should be), stop in and check out Drip!

Went to Sassi Sunday afternoon and loved it! The place is beautiful, I can see why people have their weddings and rehearsals here, its more like a resort than a restaurant. The entry way is preceded by a courtyard and fountain, as well as a walkway lined by small fountains and lights on both sides. Beyond the hostess is a large outdoor patio area and small grassy area (apparently in the fall they also have a festival here). The restaurant itself is beautiful, we sat in the bar in 4 large oversized leather chairs situated around a coffee table.  Happy hour is awesome- several glasses of wine are $7, and bottles are $20 off. Appetizers are half off, so we got one of each and had quite a feast! This included skewered shrimp over braised garbanzos, amazing fennel sausages, an assortment of deli meats, meatballs, eggplant involtini, Caponata (my favorite), pizza margarita, and beef skewers.   We also loved our waiter, he was sure to keep the wine coming to all of us and was sweet to our 2 year old.   If you're looking for a comfortable place with an amazing atmosphere and view, this is. You won't be disappointed with dinner or happy hour here!

You know those weeks where you just want to sink into a comfortable chair and relax when its all done? I had that experience on Friday night at Sassi, and it was perfect. It was great to be so attentively waited on, and the atmosphere with friends was enjoyable after the long week.  The Sassi GM, Stephen, was kind enough to welcome NVFN (North Valley Friday Nights) to Sassi last Friday. He had an area at the bar set aside for us and provided an assortment of "pickies" :D  lovely little things for us to snack on like toasted nuts, olives and flatbread. He also extended the happy hour menu for us. The wine was flowing and the food was great as always- we had the margarita pizza, the eggplant involtini, the skewered beef and the stuff squah blossoms. Everything was perfect.  Sassi is definitely one of my faves, thanks so much for having us, we'll be back very soon

After a failed attempt to get lunch at Extreme Pita (see previous review) we walked over to BWW and were pleasantly surprised. It was our first time there and from the outside we didn't expect to find a decently cool sports bar- not a bad seat in the house, there are literally wall to wall TVs, you can't miss the game.   The service was phenomenal from the hostess to the server to the runners. I even dumped my coke like a clumsy pregnant woman and a cheerful girl came over to clean it up and had the server over with a new drink in no time.   We started with a half dozen medium wings and they were very good. I had the buffalitos and onion rings. The rings were pretty average, and I liked the buffalitos a lot except that the flour tortillas was a bit dry/stale. My son got the popcorn shrimp and ate every last one of them, and hubby got a chicken wrap that he liked a lot.   We will definitely be back, mainly when I'm not pregnant and may partake in games and beer :D

This is one of our favorites! Ate here yesterday and great as always! Nestled in the heart of "old west", artistic Cave Creek, don't let the name Cave Creek Coffee Company fool you!  While they do have a great coffee bar, we go for the great menu (try a pizza or the fabulous mango chicken salad), vast wine selection (dozens of wines by the bottle and glass, as well as wine tasting evenings) and the atmosphere (a more formal but comfy dining area near the wine bar and a funky shabby-chic arty seating area just beyond the coffe bar where you can grab a table or sit with friends on oversized couches) that also has live entertainment and small concerts out back.   You won't be disappointed by the friendly service and laid back atmosphere! Can't find parking? Drive through the parking lot to the side / back of the resturant.

Had a great dinner here tonight with the fam. The service was very slow to start but the server warmed up when my gf started talking about a winery she'd visited in Hawaii that he'd also visited.  Every time we go I wonder why we don't go more. Half the place is very casual and the other half (which has a rockin wine bar) is really nice. They have these great oversized couches, a fireplace and a small music venue. Tonight they had a guitarist and Wednesday nights are $5 wines 4p-6:30p. We had the 5 cheese plate (you choose 5 cheeses from a list) accompanied by dried fruits and lavosh crackers, the green chili pork stew (delightfully spicey with chunks of potatoes, tomatoes, red onion, and just the right amount of cilantro), the C4 Signature salad (mixed greens with pulled chicken, mangoes, avocadoes and an amazing habanero raspberry dressing), and.lots.of.wine.lots.  Nice but not at all stuffy and tons of great wines by the bottle and glass (and a great selection of beers for non-wine drinkers). Had a great night, highly recommended :D

Had the best BEST time here tonight! My mama and best girlfriends treated to me a fun day for my birthday and I insisted on wrapping up the afternoon with happy hour on me. I've never been but we wanted to go somewhere nice and stopped in.   The restaurant is beautiful- we sat in a high back comfy booth in the bar which is really nice. The bar has shelves of backlit colorful liquor bottles above it (ala the Ocean Club bar). We has 2 rounds, including the Vitamin C martini, White Chocolate Martini, Flirtini and Black Cherry cocktail- they were all really great! We also got the colossal shrimp appetizer (which technically weren't all that colossal, they were just normal), the sliders (the bacon and maytag bleu cheese was amazing!) and the AZ Eggrolls (a bit on the greasy side but very tasty and perfect for happy hour). The tab was only $65 (it was happy hour and the prices averaged about $6/ drink and app). The service was also extremely good.   It's been a long time since I felt like raving about a restaurant- it was great!

Stumbled upon this place last night (during First Friday) and couldn't find a sign or the name until we saw a poster hanging inside. Cool house that was built in the 20's, with the DJ up top in the loft (music was great), lots of great art on the walls and the bar has been built into where the kitchen of the house was.   They were totally packed and coudn't even get out to the back but it was really fun. Everyone  was friendly and having fun. The website says they offer 80+ beers, we had Blue Moons and some others I'd never seen before (which is always cool!). Highly recommended, especially for First Friday- the artists selling their works, jewelry, handmade goods, purses, sunglasses and more are lined up down the street near the Lost Leaf, and you can walk a short distance to galleries and the AZ Center (great place to park if you don't get downtown early).

Introduced to D'lish today by a friend. I'd already had breakfast (although the menu looks great, lots of delicious sounding, healthy options) but he suggested a Chai coffee. I don't usually like Chai Tea, but I thought I'd give the Chai coffee a chance based on his recommendation.  When I ordered, the server suggested a "Sexy Dirty Chai", which as lurid as it sounds means adding vanilla. The Sexy Dirty Chai Coffee over ice is hands down now my favorite coffee drink. The place is tiny, has a really cool, funky interior and also has a drive thru- a true local gem. The service is friendly and energetic and I plan to start my day here again soon :)

Had a great lunch here with my friends Sherry and Brandon. The two owners (I am guessing here, but father and son?) were very friendly and attentive. I had the baba ganouj pita with lettuce and tomato, and everyone else's food looked great (a chicken pita sandwhich and amazing looking lentil soup). I was throroughly entertained by a middle eastern television show (satellite I guess?), and the great mix of locals and business people. The market section is also great- you'll find loads of bottled cooking oils, spices, pickles and other pickled veggies, canned eggplant, cous cous and pastas, as well a fridge section with nice looking prepared foods. Will definitely return!

Introduced to the Office by a friend and really liked it. The lunch specials are great- a smaller portion entree with a side and beverage for under $7! The atmosphere is pretty cool too, kind of like a fun sports bar with lots of tv's but nicer than average.  I found the staff, particularly the manager, Audrey, to be friendly but our server was less than enthusiastic. That being said, the overall experience was really good. I had the lunch size chicken burrito and calabacitas and really enjoyed it. For those of you on the lookout for wifi and outlets, they have those, too.   I will definitely be back!

If you haven't been to this Farmers' Market you are in for a real treat! Prices aren't as good as I thought they'd be at a market, but the quality makes up for it (and most vendors will give you a smokin deal if you buy in bulk). The produce is outstanding- So fresh and tasty!! The farmers and vendors themselves are a bonus, too, friendly and generous with the samples, and really sweet with the little ones. Look out for Great Harvest breads- we bought a loaf of carmel apple bread and we can't stop eating it! It is soft and moist, and has little chunks of chopped apples and carmel.  I wish there were a little more variety- the produce is fresh and bountiful, and the food vendors have some great things (look for the pulled pork and green chili breakfast burrito, oh mannnnn they are awesome!), but I wasn't so impressed with the crafts. Hopefully there will be more as we near the holidays. Most of what you'll find is so-so jewelry, some nice soaps and candles, and tie dye.  The parking is kinda crazy, but you can drive around to the back of the park and park on the street. Hardly anyone parks there and you get a nice walk along the pond and through the playground. Beautiful way to spend the cooler mornings with friends, your children or walking your dog.

Had dinner here last night. The atmosphere is way over the top, to the point that it kind of bugged me a little. The walls are plastered with fake antique signs, small floral prints, painted messages and quotes- It kind of made me feel anxious. There is also a weird gator head at the bar- it's that kind of place.   Other than that though the food was amazing. We started with fried okra and it was awesome- nice big pieces deep fried and served with a delicious spicy mustard sauce. Hubby enjoyed the novelty of iced tea served in mason jars. We both had bbq tri tip sandwiches which were very good and not at all greesy, and I loved the spicy bbq sauce. I was a bit disappointed with the braised greens- they were extremely salty and devoid of flavor. Also, the server was ok enough, he just lacked any kind of enthusiasm.  All in all it was a pretty good experience and we would try it again.

This used to be one of my favorite restaurants :( We noticed that right after it changed hands the service wasn't as good as it used to be, but when we went recently it seems to have improved.  The food has always been superb- even if you aren't a steak eater, you are going to love their steaks (aged in-house)! I am also a fan of the spicey Mambo salad with wasabe dressing (Mastro's salad is also really good, topped with a big shrimp, mmmm), the chilean sea bass, and my all time favorite sinful splurge has to be the gnocchi side dish with cheese, lobster and truffle oil. Oh yes. The Mastro's potatoes are also nice and cheesy and one of my favorite sides.  The butter and lava cakes are also a nice way to top off the evening. Don't even think about getting a seat at the bar if you go on a weekend night at 7pm (and you will probably need to call in your reservations at least a week in advance during season), but you can do some good people watching- twenty somethings that think they are all that, ladies of the night looking for sugar daddies and sugar daddies abound! My father in law even ran into Jenna Jameson there (yes, it was an akward conversation :)  They have a really nice private dining room that looks in on the kitchen (really fun to watch them hoppin' in there!), but it has recently changed- be prepared to provide a credit card and commit to a minimum for the room these days. This is a great place for a special night out, a big celebration, or a fun place to have a nightcap after a crazy night.

We had a fabulous time at Roka Akor on Friday night! They saved the day by being able to take our large group with little notice. We met some friends early for drinks at the bar. The service was a bit slow, but it was pretty busy. I had a glass of wine, one of my girlfriends got a lovely blood orange margarita and the bartender made up a beautiful fruity non-alcoholic drink for my prego girlfriend.  We were shown to our table right on time and had a fabulous server (wish I could remember her name) who took the time to explain both the Yelp Eats menu, the regular menu and about the restaurant. We'd ordered a bottle of wine at the bar that wasn't part of the Yelp Eats wine special but she honored it anyway.   From there on out, all I can remember is servers filling my wine glass and bringing dish after dish of wonderful food! I had the tempura sweet potato and white fish, both were delicious- I am looking forward to going back just for them! Next, I had the spicy avocado sushi and the hamachi serrano chilli roll, which were some of the best sushi I've had in a while. Hubby's pork chop was cooked to perfection, too. I can't remember the last time we went out and both agreed that the atmoshphere, food, price and service were great. Best of all, he had a great birthday and we had a very memorable time with our friends. We will definitely be back!

This place is awesome! If you're looking for a fun bar or a loud and friendly place to bring your kids, this is. The service and atmosphere were great and so was the food! We started with wings that were really tasty and had a mean kick, and I had the chicken sandwhich and fries. Hubby had the beef stew and it was really good, the meat was very tender like it'd been cooking all day but the veggies were still firm. Highly recommended!

I love this place! I don't even want to know how or why it is so inexpensive or how they can give away $5 off coupons each week (you can use 1 for every $20, and you can often print more coupons from their website, too).   It is smaller than most grocery stores, but they have a great selection. I like their generic brand and the prices are great. They have $2.99 wines that could rival two buck chuck, prepared foods are very tasty and they have huge price cuts on things about to expires (produce, meats, dairy, prepared foods) which is perfect if you're stopping in for dinner that night.   The only drawback is the people- they could be a little friendlier, but I can't complain when its clean, fresh, inexpensive and offers a great variety!

Invited here for a meeting last week and really enjoyed it. On a side note, I am surprised at how often I am getting invited to the Indian School and Miller area these days, lots of great little places down there.   The atmosphere is very cute, a big bright pink wall, black leather furniture and ultra chic fashion photos on another wall (one of my guests knows the owner, apparently he was the photographer?).   The pasties in case looked really lovely, and we had very attentive service. Our food was delicious- I had the the organic carrot veloute, a smooth and delicious soup accented with ginger and cilantro. It was served with a bed of lettuce and dressing. The only things that didnt thrill me were the salad (is it salad or garnish? if its a salad a couple slices of tomato and cucumber would be nice) and the price is a bit on the high side- $7 for the soup. But the overall experience was great and we'll be back.

The entire team at Whole Foods is amazing! I recenly took at tour at this location with some friends (phoenixfridaynight.com), and Julie, Bianca, Shawn and Jesus made it a memorable event!  I didn't realize it, but everything in the store is either organic or all natural. You can have anything in the seafood department cooked to order, anything in the meat department butchered to order. Some other little things I didn't know about whole foods- you can make fresh pressed peanut butter near the bulk foods section, there are bins with different combos (peanuts and chocolate chips, honey roasted peanuts, etc) for different flavors. There is also a wine and tapas bar at this location and you can also ask for samples of just about anything in the store. I plan to visit the taqueria soon (next to the sandwhich and pizza stations). And, I mustve walked by a thousand times and never noticed, but they have a smoothie and coffee bar at the front of the store too.  I love Whole Foods- I know a lot of people who say they are more expensive so they avoid it, but I think their prices have gotten a lot better. Plus, you are supporting local growers and producers. How cool is that?! Thanks Whole Foods!

I love love love this store. I love this store so much I would marry it. Why? In addition to the cool, friendly people who work there, and the amazing produce, healthy selection, gorgeous girly things like fresh flowers and bath salts...  they found my wallet. I made my weekly trip yesterday afternoon and this morning turned my house upside down looking for my wallet. I got so desperate and panicky that I started looking in weird places like my son's art supplies thinking he borrowed it...   Some kind soul turned in my wallet and Sam, a WF employee proactively looked me up online and called and left a message at my office. When I got there, Sam was very kind, had me sign for my wallet and took it out of their locked safe. I was so appreciative to have my wallet back (and with all of its contents, too).   That's really all I want in life, nice people that do the right thing and take care of you when you do something dumb like drop your wallet in the grocery store (the bath salts don't hurt though...). thanks :D

Had a business meeting here this morning, it was the first time I've been. The place was small but sunny and clean. It was pretty good- you're standard breakfast / bagel place. I had a toasted bagel with cream cheese and an iced tea and my guest had eggs, home fries, a sausage patty and a soda for $12, not bad. They also offer Boar's Head meats, and lots of sides. The guy behind the counter was not a super warm guy, but he took care of  us and got the food out quick and fast. The place was empty when we arrived at 9am, but it filled up quickly with professionals from the neighboring medical buildings. Overall, it will be a nice place to add to the breakfast rotation.

The Herb Box provided us one of the best restaurant experiences we've had in a very long time. The Herb Box on Pima in DC Market Ranch is really beautiful, warm and comfortable. It has a smaller deli kind of section, a larger dining room and outdoor patio area. We sat outside under the heaters and were treated to a great experience.   First, our waiter was really great. He had a great personality, was very attentive, and had lots of great recommendations for us. I started with a blackberry mojito- it had a very distinctive and strong flavor, but I liked it quite a bit. I am not a big fan of mint but found that the blackberry mellowed the mint. It went down easy!  Hubby got the steak and gorgonzola salad, and listened to him talk about how great it was with every bite! I also got to try the trout which was seasoned and cooked to perfection. I ordered some appetizers for my dinner including the brown sugar and jerk pulled pork sliders, cheesed stuffed fried olives and the falafel plate. I enjoyed all of it, seriously I ate until I couldn't anymore. The fried olive were frickin incredible, I've never had anything like them. The green olives were a bit tart and full of rich creamy cheese, and finished off with a light crunchy fried batter.   I am totally thrilled with this place, it is one of my new faves and will be added to the regular rotation.

Stopped by here yesterday at happy hour! Had a late lunch so a friend I shared the carrot souflee (it was good but not quite what we were picturing, guess  we should've asked...) and a couple glass of wine ($4 at happy hour!). Regularly, all the wines are $6/glass or $20/bottle, even on wines that cost quite a bit more at other restaurants. The service was a little on the slow side, but very friendly. Also really like the atmosphere, lime green white and black looks clean and modern but warm. The outside seating area also looked really nice. Will definitely try it again for dinner soon.

I'd never been to Sweet Republic before, but we decided to host an event here (north valley friday night) on the last Friday night of June. The owners were very friendly and welcoming. The place is really cute and their ice cream is amazing! I had the date ice cream paired with roquefort blue cheese ice cream. It sounded crazy so I had to get it, and it was really really good! (for the less adventurous, S R offers normal flavors too, my son had mint chocolate chip). The home made brittle makes for a yummy topping and next time I plan to try one of their ice cream sandwiches- yummy ice cream in between two oversized cookies.   Highly recommended!!

Please, please, please do yourself a favor and visit this place. It is mash up of relaxation, crazy-busy, gorgeous colors, an amazing array of make up and tools, really cool jewelry, stunning before and after photos and great music.  I went to see Zethina today based on a friend's recommendation. The appointment was for custom foundation matching, but despite being very busy, Zethina took her time with me, consulting on colors, doing my face and even showing me how to apply false lashes. I was so pleased with how I looked- really glamorous but soft, still me. I plan to return very soon for more makeup and a massage. I can't say enough how impressed I was at the place, the quality of the makeup, and Zethina herself.   If you want to look and feel amazing make an appointment to see her!!

Had a fabulous girls dinner here! I'd never been, but one of the girls suggested it. At first I was little leery, I haven't really had my best meals in hotel restaurants. I was pleasantly surprised.  The place is really pretty, polished but unpretentious and comfortable with large tables and booths (the kind of place you can meet with a big group of friends and they aren't put off), and the bar area was hoppin. The service was very good, our waiter made great suggestions based on what we'd like and was very attentive. Best of all was the food. I had the Caesar Salad, which was decent, but the baked tomato soup was realllllllyyy good. The flavors were delicious (sometimes tomato soup can be really acidic but my guess is that they even it out with a creamy base maybe?) and the potato souffle (sort of a whipped twice baked potato side) which was also really nice.  I will definitely be back, and I recommend it!

Ok, I cannot seem to find a friggin laptop cord that will charge my 5 year old laptop (I know, I know, that's like 10 trillion years in technology years, I must be some cheap ass fruit for not throwing this one into the heap at the dump and conforming to mass consumerism. I am an idiot who does not deserve to find a replacement power cord. But I digress...).  So, after determining that I would only find universal crappy cords that would not work on eBay, Hubby and I decided to bite the bullet and... actually drive to a store... and buy one- just like we used to in the good 'ol days.  This Radioshack is very near to our house so we swung in. Much to my surprise, there were 2 very helpful women working the floor. They even opened packages and attempted to charge the laptop while we were there. We wound up spending $108 (on a stupid cord which we later found out  powers the laptop but doesn't actually seem to charge it, so I guess it will be going back) and walked out decently happy.  So, even though overpriced and not perfect, I guess technically we got what we needed and the service was pretty good. On a side note, I am only giving the overall experience 4 stars- for some reason every experience I have ever had with a Radioshack indicates that it attracts douches (I hope this isn't a reflection on me going there). There was a total jerk customer who was jerky to my little boy and kept saying stupid things like "WOW, this is a LOT of batteries for $9.99, what would I even DO with ALL these batteries??". Yes, jerk, it is a good deal. Don't buy them if you don't need them. And a weird guy with a boy who seemed be trying super hard to seem super smart and know-it-all-ish. Great, I don't need to know that your dumb parents saw fit to give you a cell phone at the ripe old age of 9 or that you understand blue tooth technology.   Anyway, its not Radioshack's fault that they have moronic customers, but it is a tribute to their outdated marketing, store displays and organization, and somewhat lame variety of slim pickins cell phones and remote control Tonka Trucks. If they would just try a bit harder to join this century instead of making time stand still they would probably do better.  But what do I know, this is all just my opinion. Anyone know where a loser can get a functioning power cord for a 10 trillion year old Gateway laptop?

We haven't been here in years and were having one of those rare nights where we had a sitter, couldn't decide where we wanted to go and all we could agree on was wanting a sit down dinner in a hurry to make a movie... so, we wound up at Carraba's.  The same man who greets guests was still sitting at the door greeting people (very sweet guy, makes the atmosphere, totally). Frank, our server, did a great job, he had a lot of personality and we enjoyed him. Everything else was good, its just always the food that seems to just. be. 95%. I had a bowl of the lentil soup which is awesomeness in a bowl, but got rainbow trout encrusted with hazelnuts. It sounded amazing, and mostly was, but it was drenched in a butter sauce. blegh. The side of broccoli was also cold. Other than that, the price was decent, service was quick and attentive.

Matt at Sutra invited me and my staff to come down to try out a class before our meeting next door at Drip. Matt is a true professional- he set us up for a custom class with instructor Danielle during a time they don't normally offer a class. He also let Drip know that we'd be over afterwards (and they were ready for us with a private meeting area all set up which was really cool).   Danielle's energy is amazing, she is both soothing and energizing, and just cool. She gave individual instruction to make the class suitable for those of us beginners (ahem, me), those of us who are more advanced and for my very prego VP :) The atmosphere is great too, the yoga room is a minimally decorated room with loads of candles, lanterns and simple lighting, and pretty hardwood floors.  We all left feeling fantastic and we had a very productive meeting. Can't wait to do it again!

So, got a tip from a friend that I really needed to check this place out, so we headed over for dinner with friends after Ignite Phoenix. I kind of wanted to go some place else and wound up being S glad my friend picked this place :)  When we pulled up I thought "oh Im so not in the mood for "nice" (ie expensive hotel restaurant" (its inside the Clarendon), I was tired and not dressed for it. I was pleasantly surprised that the place looked very nice but has a really comfortable, super low key vibe. The service was really good, our waiter was very friendly and he didn't make fun of me when I tried order the side of corn (Elote Callejero. yeah, you say it). Anyway, the food was awesome- they do breakfast all day so I got huevos rancheros which were really good. The side of refried beans was ok, about what you'd expect, but. the. corn. Oh my. It was heavenly- its an ear of grilled corn sprinkled with paprika and piled high with coija cheese. It was sooo good.   We finished the meal with the Crepas, or banana crepes, which were really nice, the crepes were very good! Everything right down to the chips and salsa were very good, and we will definitely be back. By the way, the price was very reasonable, before the tip, we paid about $35 for our half of the appetizer, 2 meals, a soda, 2 beers, 2 side dished and dessert. do it.

We had a very disappointing stay at this property, but more disappointing has been the blatant lack of follow up. Rather than come to Yelp first, I sent 3 private messages on Facebook. A week later I got an email asking about my stay. On June 24th, I finally got an email from Joseph. I wrote back on June 26th with the details of the problems during our stay... and heard nothing back. I followed up with another email to him July 1st and sent another private message on FB the same day... Nothing from either channel.  I am completely shocked at our experience and the follow customer service. This is not the experience I've come to expect. In fact, I went from a fan who wanted to share about my poor experience to feeling like I never want to book at one of your properties again -- your lack of communication did that.   In the hopes that this might reach someone there, here is the email I sent to Joseph:   "Hi Joseph, Thanks for your email. I hate to complain, but we experienced a few disappointing issues, and I appreciate the opportunity to share. Since becoming Hilton members we've made the effort to choose Hilton properties, including on our staycation. We've generally had good experiences and were surprised at our stay.  I booked 2 rooms for 2 nights, checking in on Father's day to celebrate with my husband, dad and kids. We were impressed that our early check in was accommodated, we were very grateful in fact. Unfortunately, I kind of wish we were told to come back - we had maintenance people turn up looking for a mystery issue they couldn't identify, and while my son was undressed and using the bathroom, a maid came by wanting to take inventory of the mini-bar. I asked if she could please come back a little later, that we needed privacy, and she refused. I was really take back at her refusal to return.  Generally speaking, the property just seemed in rough shape. We get that it's off season, and as locals we are able to take advantage of great rates, but it almost seems that there is an attitude that no one is around to see the mess. But we were :( We stayed in Ocatilla, and the entrance to Cottage K, which we saw every time we came in and out, was full of boxes and trash. The hallways were full of visitors' dishes and trash. On our first afternoon, we came in around lunchtime and used dishes were still sitting in the hallway over night. There was a plate of half eaten food on the ground next to the elevator that sat for our entire visit - it became a joke with the kids wondering if it would still be there the next time we walked by... and every time it was :( The scale in my dad's room didn't work, the shower constantly dripped (more like streaming) and his remote was dead.  One of the days we visited the pool - my dad saw a bat that had fallen into the pool and was swimming around, and alerted a maintenance person. The man who came to help didn't know what to do, so he scooped it up in a cup and dumped it out on the ground. We were concerned about a child or pet getting bitten, but didn't know what else to do :(  On our last day, we asked to check our bags so we could check out on time and visit the pool. We specifically did that so our bags wouldn't sit in our hot car all afternoon. When we were ready to leave, we went to the desk to get our bags and were sent to the bell desk -- outside. Our clothes, 2 laptops, my makeup, and food were sitting out side in the 100+ degree heat for a half day, and where anyone could've walked off with it all :( It seemed like common sense that you wouldn't leave luggage out in the heat all afternoon, in fact it seemed very inconsiderate.   The experience had the effect on my husband that he wanted to stop spending money when he felt it was no longer a value, and overall, the visit was not relaxing or very enjoyable. This is my second time staying at your property - the first time was so nice, I really wanted to share that experience with my family but this fell very, very short of our anticipation :(  I know your property has a very good reputation, and again, we usually enjoy and are loyal to Hilton. I thought you'd want to know about our experience, thanks for your time."  Buyer beware.

Went here for the first time last week and had a great experience. The restaurant was very clean, the service was great. The best part? The food. I've been in AZ for 10 years now and I can say without a doubt that its some of the best food I've had in a restaurant (and this from a pregnant woman no less ;)  I had the fried chicken tenders, cheesy grits and fried okra. First, the food came out piping hot, I mean steaming and hot to the touch. The batter on the chicken was thick and crispy. The grits were cooked to perfection- dry enough to hold together a bit but still moist. And the okra was fantastic, too. It didn't hurt that my fresh lemonade came in a mason jar, either.   I will be back. a lot :)

I couldn't be happier with 5th and Wine - I was first introduced to the restaurant a few years ago when they supported AZ ALS Association by cooking for an event I volunteered for.  Since then, I've had several date nights and lunch meetings, at 5th and Wine, and I've never been disappointed. The atmosphere is always comfortable, the servers treat you like they know you, and the food is mouthwatering (the fries and soups are among my faves!).  If they hadn't already won me over, they did this past weekend. We had an event and the original caterer had an emergency and cancelled on short notice. Scott (the General Manager), took care of everything. He put together a menu of crowd-pleasers that kept us well within budget and saved the day. Thank you!!

Tonight my 3 yo son fell and split his chin open. It's never fun to go to ER, but I am so grateful for the experience we had tonight, everything went so smoothly.   Cassie immediately introduced herself and brought toys and crayons for my son and his older brother. She introduced us to each person who came to help. Nurse Andy and Dr Winter were both very friendly, and Cassie brought supplies to show our son what would be happening when he was getting stitches. Even as they got busier and more kids came in, she was very kind and patient.   He got three stitches while watching 101 Dalmatians- I was pleasantly surprised at how good the experience was for bad circumstances. Thanks so much to the staff of Scottsdale Healthcare.

We come to this JJ location all the time and service is usually pretty good. Today we ran in for a cool treat and on the way out our 4 year old dumped the whole thing on the ground by accident and started crying.   Husband and I started cleaning up and consoling him. By the time I got back in line to order another, Max had already made him a new one.  Max, that quick gesture of kindness made my son's day, so you made my day. We're loyal fans of JJ and Max!

Stayed here for the weekend and had a great time. Upon driving up to the lobby you can already tell that this property is much newer and cleaner than the rest on the strip. The main thing that won me over is the lack of cornball theme - every detail is chic.   We stayed in a Terrace Studio with an incredible view overlooking the Bellagio's fountain, so we were treated to gorgeous shows day and night. The bed and pillows were super comfy and I loved the layout of the bathroom, including a deep tub with window overlooking the Vegas lights. We had a nice wet bar and dishwasher, and I was thrilled with the closet space and seating - more than enough for our guests to stop by for drinks, including several comfy seats, a large couch and bench. The bedroom can be closed off for privacy with a pocket door, and there are flat screens in both the bedroom and living room.  The bars and lounges at The Cosmo are average for Las Vegas, but The Chandelier is really something to see, even if you can't get in when its packed. The Wicked Spoon, however, has one of the best breakfast buffets I've been to in the city.   Generally, I thought the service was quite good - the staff is friendly, any concerns were immediately resolved and the concierge did a great job of recommending and booking tickets for a show.  This is definitely my new choice for staying in Vegas.

yay! my 100th review :) So glad its a 5 star.  Hubby surprised me with a night out- He heard from a little birdy (gf Heather) that I wanted to try Orange Sky. This experience is probably slightly biased in that I was completely smitten from being surprised with a nice dinner at a beautiful place... but here goes :)  The valet area at Talking Stick is nicely lit and busy, good energy there. When you go to the elevator lobby for the OS, there is a receptionist that checks your reservation before you go up to the 15th floor in a glass elevator- oh, the view. Just amazing. Its the kind of elevator that makes you want to hit the emergency button and make out, except that now I'm old enough to think 1) elevators are probably really germy places 2) there's probably a camera in that elevator (not my thing so much, but I'm not judging), and 3) what if there was a real emergency? what kind of jerk would I be? ok, I digress.  After checking in with the hostess we got drinks at the bar. Yes, I know, people complain about the drinks being too expensive, they're $10-$15. But the price is comparable to any other high end restaurant in the valley, and they're all alcohol. I'd rather pay top dollar for a stiff drink than have 3 watered down drinks. The Sunset Martini was soooo good.   We were shown to our table, a big booth facing the fireplace, perfect for a romantic dinner. The service was fantastic, really- its what Mastro's was back in the day. I had the artichoke bisque (a special for Restaurant Week but I didn't want the rest of the menu, so they accommodated me and let me get it anyway)- it was very tasty (the pancetta didn't hurt). Hubby had a beet salad that he enjoyed, and got the scallops which were cooked perfectly. I had the shrimp/scallop steaks wrapped in jalapeno bacon and they were as good as they sound. We also got the smoked cheddar whipped potatoes (this was the only so-so part of the meal, they were on the bland side) and the mushroom risotto which was really good. Risotto is one of those things thats either cooked right or not, and it was done really well.   I can't wait to go back, it was really enjoyable.

Just spent a ton of money for 8 people to see a movie and it felt like the heat was running. Hubby spoke to employee who then came into the theater to tell us they were fixing the issue, but it never cooled off. The 4 kids in our group walked out looking flushed with red cheeks. Not a good experience this time :(

I'm officially a Drybar whore. I can't stay out of the place. I recently became the mayor on foursquare and was slightly horrified to realize it was the 3rd time I'd been there in a week lol Sure, sometimes they run a bit late or whatever, but overall I've had a consistently great experience.  I love the atmosphere, the drinks (mimosas if you like. me likey), the girly movies, its ALWAYS clean which is important to me and I have a favorite girl to go to (can't tell you who it is and have her get all booked up :)   I thoroughly enjoy popping in first thing in the morning and having fabulous salon-looking hair all day, its a treat and I love it! The women who work there are very friendly, I'm always in and out in an hour and they have my card on file- I just tell them to charge it, they email a receipt and I'm out the door. They are even super sweet and attentive when I occasionally have to bring my baby boy- that gets them extra bonus points.  love it! Drybar, I want to work there, I want to own one, I want to whisper sweet nothings in your ear. I feel like I'm cheating on my husband, good thing there is no receipt to bring home or he'd probably kill me lol

Ok, this story has good, bad and ugly.   First the bad: today was the second time in a row we ordered and it took over an hour to get our food (order confirmation came at 11:50am and still had no lunch by 1:15pm). Both times I called and asked where the order was and talked to people who are obviously not trained for phone service. It was a lot of "huh?", "um" and "hold on".   Now the ugly: Today the manager, J., got on the phone and I was just plain hangry. I wasn't disrespectful but I did unload my frustration that this was the second time in a row we had problems with delivery, and I was about to leave my office for the day without lunch. He stayed professional the entire time.   And the good: J. personally remade the entire order, comped it and delivered it himself within 15 minutes. He was totally sweet about it and made good. Typically when you hold someone accountable they get all crappy about it (especially if one of you is hangry), but he was great.  Based on the other comments here on Yelp it seems like they have some consistent problems. Will have to try them one more time to see how it goes, willing to give them another chance after how it was resolved today.

Love this place! My gf invited me, she registered but I waited a couple days and the class was full :( I called to see if there was any way to get in and they were kind enough to get me in with my gf. When I arrived the woman who greeted me was very kind (she turned out to be the instructor, and I was completely impressed with her demonstration and charisma). The place was packed and the space was a bit tight, but we had a really fun time drinking wine and getting creative (with guidance!). My only criticism was that the music was very loud between the instructor's demonstrations and made it really difficult to talk with my friend, but it was good music so not a real problem :) Can't wait to go again, thinking we'll try the open studio with my boys soon!

Disappointing in the sense that this had the potential to be a great experience.  Cute place, nice staff, pretty patio. Oj tasted like fresh squeezed, carmel machiato was delish, food was fresh and good quality.  On the other hand, the table was wobbly and driving me crazy. Omelette came w the wrong side, no cheese and realized I never got my toast. Had to ask twice for coffee refill, and took 15 minutes to get the check which was a nightmare with kids.  Could hear other tables with similar complaints, maybe an off day.

We had a rough night. One disclaimer, I'm not a girl who is much into roughing it. But wow, there is not a single comfort or luxury at this place.  It took us 45 minutes to park. We sat in a line in the street to get to the venue and then another for disabled parking for my dad who was with us and has mobility challenges. By the time we got to the disabled lot, we were informed that the lot was full and had to drive to the back of the complex (a dusty dirt lot full of rocks) to park, about 150 yards from the entrance.  By the time we arrived our kids were already melting down. Basically this event is a bunch of hot air balloons in a giant dirt lot.   The food we wound up getting was expensive ($8 BBQ sandwich and $6 fries, spent $23 for a side of Mac n Cheese and 4 bottles of water), and below average (even for a festival style event). There is also nowhere to sit, not a single table or chair in the entire place (especially rough on the disabled folks) so people just camp out on the (dirt) ground all over the place.  The kids are able to trick or treat at the hot air balloons, but the lines to get candy were very long and they give one piece of candy per child. Not that I was looking to make a candy killing, but after an hour of "trick or treating" the kids didn't have much to show for it.  The port a potties could've used some attention and they were pitch black inside (no lighting in the area and grateful the kids didn't have to go).  We finally persuaded the kids to get milkshakes and leave. We were there with cousins and spent $40 for 7 milkshakes. Yeah, do that math.  I feel so bad complaining so much. It's a personal policy for me to mostly just reward great experiences with positive reviews rather than complain. But yeah, we'll just wait for Halloween next year....

I had a great experience at this salon - Kevin did my nails and I asked him to please use care when trimming my cuticles. They are super dry and always hurt after a manicure. He took his time and paid attention to detail, and it was the first time I've ever had a manicure where my cuticles didn't bleed. I also enjoyed talking with the owner Mark, he is very friendly and seems to care about his business and clients. I look forward to returning soon :)

Unfortunately I have to give this store 2 stars based on 2 poor customer service experiences in the past week. The first time, I got home and realized that the woman who rang me up forgot to put merchandise in my bag. When I drove back later that day to get it, everyone at the counter treated it like this was a fairly normal occurrence and there was no apology offered.  I did like the selection of bags and thought it was probably a one time bad experience and stopped by to look for a new bag. A few days later, I was at dinner with friends when I realized the first time I was using my new purse, it still had the massive security tag on it. Again, I arrive this morning to have it removed and no apology.  I did give it two stars though, I got some great deals on designer brands and they have a great selection of cute inexpensive costume jewelry, think Charming Charlie but half the price.  For less expensive brands you can get great value for the money. That being said, I really REALLY value great service at any price point. So, for prices I recommend this location, just know what you're getting into with the service.

I was*this* close to getting a new phone when the home button stopped working on my iPhone, bringing work on the run to a grinding halt.   My company is in the same building as Nextech, so we stopped in to see if anything could be done. Within 10 minutes I had a smoothly functioning phone again, for a LOT less money than I expected.  I highly recommend this place if you need help with your electronics. Music in there is good, too :)

All I need is good company, good food and good drinks, and last night at Bitter & Twisted delivered on all three.  The interior is a very cool paired back modern industrial feel that reminded me of a bar you'd find in downtown Seattle. Dimly lit, high back comfortable booths, frosted windows and chandeliers lend a glamorous low key speak easy feel.  I ordered a different drink on every round (and there were several ;) and I enjoyed every expertly made one. The drinks take center stage here with a booklet of many signature cocktails available, but the food was pretty amazing too- we had the Betelnut pork belly (think super amazing high end Chinese delivery ribs with red sauce), the Ramen burger (it was cray), the meat and cheese board (house made pate and bacon and brussel sprout spread), and the angry panda lettuce wraps (a bit too "angry" for my partner so be warned if you aren't into spicy, but very tasty).   I know some Yelp reviewers complain about price at B & T but I think some of us Phoenicians are unaccustomed to having a high end big city bar in our downtown. I found the $6-$12 drinks to be extremely reasonable as compared to other metropolitan bars, but drinks are of much better quality. And I know waiting outside for a table isn't fun, but it makes for a much more relaxed atmosphere not to be jammed into a bar with a bunch of people waiting around. You can go into any dive bar to walk immediately up to the bar and order a cheap drink- that's not what this is.  We all thoroughly enjoyed the experience and are looking forward to returning- highly recommended if you're looking for a more discriminating night out.

Had a great time at the opening of Rick Bronson's House of Comedy on 9/11. First, the place is gorgeous, it fits in perfectly with the upscale atmosphere you'll find on High Street in City North, making it the perfect addition to a date night or GNO. The bar area is beautifully lit and the bartender was extremely friendly and jovial - just what you'd expect from a bar in a comedy club. The interior is also gorgeous, it's dark and has nice lighting, including several large flatscreens behind the stage. The show was hilarious, Rick Bronson who was there for the opening did a great job of warming up the crowd, and we were literally crying we were laughing so hard when Tony Gaud and Harland Williams took the stage. My only criticism would be the table service - we ordered the hummus flatbread which was just sort of uninspired. It was a flatbread with some hummus, a few sprinkles of goat cheese and slices of radishes. The prices were about what you'd expect for this type of entertainment in this neighborhood, but we were a little surprised at the $17 drinks (double jack and cokes). Other than that we had an amazing time It and we definitely feel forgiving of any hiccups since it was opening night. I highly recommend trying it out, we will be back!

Such a disappointing experience when I was so happy to have a new place with good reviews to try. Yes, the place is beautiful and clean but there is a customer service disconnect.  I went in for a gel mani, and the gentleman who helped me immediately ran into issues. The polish kept cracking and bunching after I put my hands under the light for the polish to cure. At first he fixed one and said I must've bumped that nail under the light. Whatever, fine, he filed off the gel and reapplied it.   Then he has to do two more and says I'm bumping the light. I tell him that I am not, and maybe it's the product? He said no, it's OPI (great, doesn't mean it can't be defective, or a problem with application). Now he has to do 2 more nails again and he is just filing it off and reapplying. I've had my nails done a hundred times and never had this happen, and he is getting frustrated and blaming me.  With paper thin nails now from filing and polishing, I ask him to please ask someone for help. He calls a woman over and as I am explaining the issue he keeps talking over me to her in another language (language doesn't bother me, I just think in a customer service capacity, 1. don't talk about me in front of me in a way I can't understand, and 2. don't talk over me in any language).  The woman took over and fixed his work. The manicure turned out very so-so and they still charged me. I paid it, and left upset and feeling disrespected just before a family birthday party, knowing there are too many other salons around.  Might be beautiful and new, but the service is the Achilles heal for this place.
