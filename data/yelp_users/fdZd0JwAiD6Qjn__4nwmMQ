If I could rate this place 0 stars I would. My girlfriend and I both got super sick from the food here and she's a vegetarian and I'm not. We ordered completely different types of food yet the outcome was the same. We both ended up spending the rest of our Saturday night vomiting and regretting ever setting foot in this so called restaurant. First of all the only reason we tried this place is the fact that there are so many great reviews. This is absolutely the strongest evidence against the corruption that yelp has been accused of. These reviews have to be a complete farce or I'm surround by a ton of fully mentally challenged foodies. When we first walked in we knew something was off by the smell of the place. It has that same dirty smell that most asian supermarkets have. Everyone was completely rude to us and once they saw us the woman working the register actually took the menu out of the bag, almost hinting that they didn't want us ordering from them again. As terrible as the service was the food was one hundred times worse. So bad that not only did we get the worst food poisoning ever but we couldn't even eat more than a couple bites of the entrees. This place deserves to be shut down and placed on some sort of quarantine by the government. Don't listen to any of these other reviews on here they are obviously paid for and if you do decide to chance it, we'll god bless you and I hope you cancel all of your planes for the rest of the evening.

I recently visited this restaurant and was exceptionally pleased by the experience. I am always looking for new places to enjoy sushi, and saw the reviews on here were nearly flawless. Obviously I had my doubts that this was clearly a manufactured coincidence so I had to do some investigating of my own.   To my surprise though BEI justified it's reviews. I ordered yellow tail sashimi, very large and fresh pieces were presented elegantly within minutes of placing my order. Next the three rolls I ordered came out in a timely fashion. One at a time and almost as soon as I finished the previous roll.  I've recently experienced a different situation at another local sushi restaurant where my food was brought out with absolutely no order. Dinner first then, last appetizers and when I ordered another roll it took about 30 minutes to arrive.   The three rolls I ordered were the ASU, Tuna Lover and my new favorite roll The Checkerboard roll. The wasabi aioli sauce on top of the Checkerboard roll was to die for. I highly recommend  it.  Also as many other people have commented about and I feel must be address is the quality of service. Everyone was extremely nice, polite, and knowledgable. It's clear their employes love working there and when I asked how long they have been in business, accompanied with a large smile, I received a very confident and prideful response of 13 weeks today.   I rarely frequent restaurants but this one is sure be see the likes of me in the near future   Advice to you, Give this place a shot and what ever you do, try anything with their aioli sauce.
