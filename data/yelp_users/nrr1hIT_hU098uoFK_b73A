We had a good time at Giant Hamburgers on national hamburger day! I got the cheeseburger with grilled onions (free) and mushrooms ($.80). It was suuuuper greasy! Almost too greasy for me. But it was delicious! The fries were decent and the atmosphere was meh. I don't know if I would return just because of how greasy the burger was, but if you enjoy that then definitely give this place a try!

My family has been eating at Sarrano's since I was a little girl! It's definitely a favorite. The machaca beef is so delicious. We have never had a wait and the food comes so fast! I've always had great service here too. We love it!!

If you want to have everything, like the dirt and stains--aka the entire reason you take a garment to a dry CLEANERS--to simply be ironed into your clothing and returned to you, than please, take your clothes here. I'll make space for you here because I'll never take garments to this business again because of this repeated problem.

Red White and Brew is a family favorite! We've been coming here for over 10 years and it's always been great.   Tonight was no exception! Right as my husband and I sat down, hot bread was immediately brought to our table along with ice waters! Our waitress was very helpful with the menu and even brought us a sample of the soup of the day!!  I ordered the bourbon salmon and my husband ordered the bone in pork chop. My meal was incredible! I loved everything! He enjoyed his as well, but wasn't quite blown away.   Overall, our experience was top notch. We will keep coming back year after year!

Little places like this are the best! If you didn't grow up in Arizona you may be freaked out by the actual building Fiesta Burrito is in, but as a native I know these are the best places! I ordered the plan bean and cheese burro for $3 and it was delicious! The service was so fast and the workers were very kind! My mom and I were in the area the next day and I told her she should stop and get a burro so we did! She loved hers too.

We were lucky because the wait was only 20 minutes for two on a perfect February day! When we arrived, our hostess was a little short with is, but we brushed it off. Finally when we got our table there was some confusion with another couple who thought it was actually their table. Again, another weird thing we brushed off.   Our waitress was so nice and very helpful! We got the Sonny Boy and the Wiseguy and split them. It was a lot of food, but we were both starving and it was just enough! They were both delicious! I would not wait 3 hours for them though. Max 30 minutes...  Overall I think the atmosphere is great as the food is yummy too!

I love this restaurant! I've only been for breakfast, but it's been excellent every time. The only down side is the wait was close to 45 minutes...our food also took quite a while to come out. But the food was delicious! I would definitely go back!

Wow...waited over an hour for our pizza to come. Granted - they took care of our appetizer and a dessert, but a small credit doesn't mean much. It's really loud inside, has a weird smell and the food is only decent. Won't be returning.

My husband and I tried the Cozy Corner Cafe for the first time on Saturday and it was so busy! When we got there, we were about 6th in line to be seated. It took less than 3 minutes! Super impressive. The service was wonderful.   We ordered quickly and the food came out super hot which was great. The food was delicious and kept me full the rest of the day. We will definitely be back!

My husband and I went for a quick treat on a Saturday night and it was delicious! The cake batter was our favorite flavor. The smallest size was the perfect amount! The atmosphere is charming too. We will definitely be returning! Thanks Golden Spoon!

My cousin, Sommer, recommended my husband and I go see Barry for a new suit. My husband is graduating with his degree in December and needed a new suit for job interviews. Barry was extremely helpful and had great advice on what sort of colors and fit would be best for the type of work my husband will be doing. We were very happy with our purchase! A couple days later, my husband was at Macy's and saw the exact suit he bought for $650! We will definitely be returning! Thanks Barry!

We saw Circ de la Symphonie and the show was incredible!! We had great seats even though we weren't in the front area. Parking was the only small inconvenience. As a first timer, we were not sure where to park. We found a parking garage across the way that was $12 cash only.

Crackers and Co is a family favorite spot for breakfast and lunch!! I've always had great service here and have always really enjoyed what I've ordered! My two favorite breakfast items are the new princess omelet and the pork carnitas skillet! I went this morning to Crackers for my birthday with my husband and we both had a wonderful experience.  Thank you!

Seriously took 20 minutes just to get one burrito from the drive through!!! Haven't even taken a bite yet so can't comment on the food yet. Just super bugged that it's taking so long.

We love Joe's Farm Grill!! I've had the Fontina Burger twice now and it is delicious! I love sitting outside under the big trees. There is a fun feeling about this place. The fries here are not my favorite, so I like to get a side Caesar salad instead at no charge!

My husband and I wanted to go somewhere different for dinner tonight and Blue Adobe Grill did not disappoint!! The service was amazing and we had the best seats in the house! I ordered the chimichelada and he had the lobster tamales. We both liked my meal the best. We will definitely return! Great service, food and ambiance.

Wow! My husband and I decided to try Brio on a whim and I'm so glad we did. We had a great experience from start to finish. Our server was super on top of it and kept brining my husband a fresh soda (which is one of our favorite things a server can do!). We ordered the Quattro Bruschetta, the Gorgonzola Medallions and the Lobster Shrimp tortollini. All of it was soooo yummy! We will definitely be back!

We came as a family of 8 for our first trip and we were really happy with our night! The service was great. We sat on the patio because it was so nice outside, but unfortunately they do not have any lights outside so it was pretty dark. I mean, we had to use our phone flashlights to read the menu. Anyway, we ordered the mushroom pizza, the house and the bbq. The mushroom was soooo good and different! The other two were yummy but we especially enjoyed the mushroom! Only 4 stars because they need lights on the patio and the others two pizzas were about a 7/10.

We went to Bosa Donuts for a little treat around 9:40 pm and the place was empty. There were still donuts available but they didn't even make maple long johns that day! I thought that was a standard? The donuts we did get were pretty yummy! Favorite part was the outdoor seating and summer time chillin with a donut at 10 pm!

First timer at the Waffle House...everybody was super friendly! But I'm not going to be rushing back for the food anytime soon. The waffle was decent, but I would rather just go to iHOP or something.

We had a coupon so we tried this place out and it was delicious!!! We ordered wings, large pizza and garlic bread. The wings were pretty tasty, not a ton of meat. The pizza was really good too! But my favorite was the marinara sauce that came with he bread! Soooo delicious! I want to try a pasta or something with that sauce all over it! We will definitely be returning.

I really like this venue! It's so fun to buy lawn seats for the spring training games. I always eat before the game because the food is pretty pricey. We also like to park in the Target parking lot to save on the $5 parking! Good times!

We came on a Friday night and the atmosphere was great! The playoffs were on and there was just a really fun vibe. We ordered the spinach artichoke dip and it was sooo delicious! Definitely a new favorite! We also split the NW Pub burger which was yummy too! Didn't love the fries though. Service was great and overall we had a great time! We will come back soon!

We had such a lovely lunch at this location! We split the special pasta of the day and a pizza and it was the perfect amount of both. I'm so happy my husband works near here so we can go more often! It was delish and quant!

Wow. So happy we tried this place out! New favorite! After some convincing, my husband ordered the PB&J burger. I ordered the Hangover burger. We both got the sweet potato tots. The PB&J burger was so different and SO delicious! I liked it more than the Hangover, but mine was good as well. Our service was amazing and the vibe is super chill. We will definitely be returning with all our friends!

I like Backyard Tacos! The food is yummy and a good price. I really love sitting outside under the cute lights.   My one issue with this place is the set up of the salsa bar! There is constantly a group of people around it because it's just not set up for more than 1 person at a time.   Other than that I think it's a fun and casual place to eat!

We went to the Tim McGraw concert here on May 16. The high was 104 so it was definitely a warm night. We had lawn seats and brought a big blanket. It was pretty crowded, but not horrible. We had a great time. I wish the speakers were a tad louder so you could really feel the music back on the lawn. Also, the driving there was horrible. Took 1 hour to drive 15 miles...

We were super excited to Pacino's because our friends had recommended it, but it definitely fell short. The vibe was awesome with live music and dim lighting. Our server brought water over as he greeted us, which was really nice. I ordered the eggplant Parmesan and my husband had the shrimp ravioli. Mine came with a house salad which was basically just lettuce. Our food came out an HOUR later (one refill during that time) and mine was chicken, not eggplant. Another 10 minute wait and finally my correct meal came. It was ok, but I wouldn't order it again. Too bad because we were excited when we first arrived.

Pomo was an excellent choice for us to celebrate our 5 year anniversary! We went on a Saturday night around 5:30 and there was no wait. Literally 5 minutes after we walked in though we would've been waiting. The service was excellent and the owner even brought us a special anniversary treat on the house! The pizza was delicious too. The bruschetta was very different than any others I've had before. Not bad, just different. We probably wouldn't order it again. The ambiance is also very charming. We had a wonderful time!

Not super impressed this time around. I've filled my soda cup up 3 times with a different and each time it's gross. Also super watery salad. Not the same as Costa Vida in Utah unfortunately.

My family and I were so excited to try this truck! The burgers all sounded so amazing and different!   My husband got the Mac n' Cheese burger, brother got the breakfast burger and my mom and I both had the special with blue cheese and roasted peppers. Well we were all super disappointed. All of our burgers were very dry and had hardly any toppings. The Mac n Cheese burger did have yummy Mac n cheese on it, but the burger itself was very dry with no other sauces. It really didn't compare to the pictures.   There was only one employee working that night so I am wondering if he was just super busy and understaffed. Not sure...but for $8 I would have rather had something else.

I love The Sweet Tooth Fairy! I've been to this location twice and both times I had excellent customer service and the yummiest treat! First I had the original sugar cookie which was very good. Not too much frosting which is how I like it! Then today is my BIRTHDAY and since I had signed up to receive the emails, I got a free cupcake!! I chose cookie dough and it was to die for! Will definitely return for another!

Currently having the worst experience I've ever had at Cafe Rio. The line was incredibly slow and the employees seemed to not even care (or notice??). The person putting the meals together didn't know what he was doing and the crew seemed to just be goofing off. The line was almost out the door! On top of that, every table was dirty and the floor was disgusting. Giving 2 stars because my food tastes yummy but other than that this has been a bad experience! Loud ringing noise (phone??) nobody answered the whole time I was in line and on top of that a guy was using a power drill on one of the posts of the line!! What????   Update: 10 hours later and I'm still annoyed telling my husband about lunch today so changed to 1 star.

What a great find! Service was awesome, food was great and the vibe was spot on. The manager made sure we had a TV close to us with the game on that we came to watch, even though it was during the World Series. I had the garlic burger and it was really good! We will definitely go back!

Super cute location. Service was great. Got in the car with my yogurt without testing first and yikes!! The chocolate is seriously yucky with some sort of lime tart (no I didn't get any tart flavors) and the salted caramel is way too salty. I'm bummed bc I have never had a problem with the Mesa location. There goes $4 down the drain...literally bc I took 2 bites!
