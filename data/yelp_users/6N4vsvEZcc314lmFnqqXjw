No complaints here ! Like every other airport security is always a hassle, but the TSA agents are friendly. There is a nice selection of food and things to look at while you're waiting in the terminal , well at least near the southwest gates. In my opinion it's one of the better airports.

One of my favorite things about K'O Donnell's is their amazing patio! When the weather is nice this is an awesome place to hang out.  For a sports bar the food is awesome. From the prime rib wrap to the southwest salad you cannot go wrong with any menu choice. They also have a fair amount of beers on tap which is always a plus. My only complaint is sometimes the service can be pretty slow. That being said the waitresses are friendly. As someone who works nearby this is one of my favorite places to hang out after work. Keep being awesome K'O's !

I've been to this location twice now and I have to say the people who work here are super friendly. Also extremely efficient the longest I've ever waited was 30 minutes for all four tires to be replaced. Thank you for doing a great job !   Side Note: You can make an appointment online which is always helpful !

This place is super cute and extremely pink. I've only gone here twice but I really love this ice cream parlor. The ice cream here is fairly priced and extremely tasty. That being said I have never tried the food. I really don't plan on it either. I come here for the ice cream and the 1950's I've cream parlor vibe. That being said I've never had a problem with the service. If your in old town you should check it out.

This is my favorite place on mill! Their food is amazing ! :)  They also have a great selection of beers on tap as well. All of their bartenders , servers and bouncers are extremely friendly and knowledgeable.  The patio here is seriously one of my favorite places to drink and eat. They also have live music on the weekends so that's always a plus. Rula Bula I love you !

Pros: The staff is very friendly and seem knowledgeable about the mystic tan process (Or whatever its called ). I came in with a groupon and she was very accommodating. They do however tack on add-ons along with the tan , but oh well!  Cons: They were out of the the darker spray tan solution. Unfortunately I am pretty pale , so I really need a darker spray tan. After waiting the full 8 hours my tan was maybe only two shades above my natural color ! That was a let down considering I used the mystic tan for a special occasion. I ended up buying store bought tanning products to make myself darker.

I would give southwest zero stars if I could. Let me just say this is a review of southwest as a whole and not individual airports .Here's the story of the travel day from hell. I started off in New Mexico my first flight had been delayed 3 different times even before I had gotten to the airport. Thank goodness for those super helpful flight update texts . Seeing that I wasn't going to be leaving NM till very late at night if ever I decided to change my flight. Apparently that was a really bad move on my part. I arrived at the airport two hours before my flight which was supposed to be boarding at 4:30. Once at my gate I see that my flight is now delayed to 5:10. No big f-ing deal , oh just the small issue of the connecting flight that is supposed to board at 5:20 in Vegas .Surprise surprise we finally land in Vegas at 5:40 and I have to run from gate c7 to gate c25. Not only did the guy give me attitude about me being late he wouldn't let me on the plane even though he let two other people down to the plane. At this point I now have to walk up to the counter to discuss what they are going to do about me missing a flight because one of their other flights made me miss my current one. I seriously lost my shit at the counter and started crying like a big baby. They end up issuing me a new ticket once they figured out it was their fault I missed my connection. I go back down the terminal looking like a wreck and head to my new gate. My new boarding time is 8:25, but guess what ! After sitting at the gate for 10 mins the computer monitor announces that flight is now delayed till 10 . Ok then , fine this is nothing new I guess I'm just going to spend all damn day at the airport. But wait it gets so much better !!! It's just been announced that the flight will be delayed till 10:30. The airplane Is siting out on the Tarmac but now we have to wait for a crew . At this point have now told my roommate 5 different times she should pick me up from the Phoenix airport . Oh by the way I'm writing this review while still sitting in the southwest terminal at the gate. It's starting to look like I'm never going to get back to Arizona . I'm seriously wondering what the hell the delays are all about ! As far as I can tell there's no awful weather heading for Phoenix or Las Vegas. Let me just say don't fly this airline , don't waste your money. I could've driven home by now. Lastly Southwest get your shit together this is embarrassing!

The woman with the bob haircut who works here is fantastic ! I keep forgetting to ask her name . Every time she does my nails they turn out perfect ! I've never had a problem with the gel peeling or my nails breaking. Yes they are slightly more expensive than most nail salons in tempe , but I feel like it is worth the price .

Dear Habanero's ,  I love you !! This place has got to be one of the better Mexican food places I've found since moving here from Cali. Everyone who works here is always friendly and the food always comes out fast. I love the blackened chicken burrito and the blackened chicken nachos. Everything I have tried on their menu so far has been pretty damn good.

This review is for the pharmacy only ! Wish I could give negative stars . This is the worst pharmacy ! Every time I go in they always have some issue with my insurance or with filling my prescriptions. I have no idea why it's always so difficult for them to fill anything for me. Considering I have not changed insurances or medications within the last 5 years of me using cvs on mill. Why they can't get their shit together is beyond me! I've never had such issues at other cvs locations . Oh beware of the extremely bitchy pharmacy techs . Customer service here sucks they treat you like scum. I know it's a great location for most people but there's a much better cvs pharmacy located on Broadway and McClintock . You've been warned ! On a positive note the store itself is nice and the staff running the retail space is awesome.

Stacy Ann is an amazing colorist and stylist ! I found her through yelp and I couldn't be more pleased. She took me from platinum blonde to red/purple. She did such an amazing job. She made my mom and I feel extremely comfortable during my appointment. Did I mention that she's one of the coolest people I've ever met. She's absolutely fantastic and funny. Keep in mind she's popular so email, text and call to find out her availability. Thank you Stacy Ann for doing such an amazing job you're the best !

I really like morning squeeze ! The caramel latte is absolutely fantastic, that being said the food can be hit or miss. I've only ever eaten breakfast here so I really can't review their lunch menu. I usually get the thigh master omelette , some days its really tasty but other days it can be kinda meh. Other than that I have no complaints ! Sometimes the service can be slow , but I've always had very friendly waitresses. I think this is one of the better places for breakfast in old town Scottsdale. Plus it has a dog friendly patio ! YAY!

Such a cute little place ! I had no idea that it existed. We had the build your own grilled cheese with turkey , Caramelized onions and cheddar cheese. It wasn't super cheesy but it was pretty good. Also it came on gluten free bread. Did I mention this bakery is gluten free and organic. I also ordered the Caesar salad which had chicken , some sort of grain as well light Caesar dressing. It was absolutely amazing , the lettuce was fresh. I really want to go back and try their baked goods and breakfast. Give them a try !!

I've been meaning  to try this place , I'm happy I finally got to stop in. The food here is pretty good ! I had the Jamaican pork and my date had the ahi tuna. We were both satisfied with our choices. I loved the Maui pineapple wine , it was absolutely amazing. The service was just fine and not overbearing. The atmosphere of this restaurant is fun I like how they have and open patio. However I did not enjoy the rude /standoffish hostess. I understand people have off days but damn she was unfriendly. So much so my date even mentioned something. Anyways check this place out it's well worth it!

Decent burgers and pretty good milkshakes ! I love the Ortega burger and the buffalo chicken wrap. The fries inconsistent , sometimes they're crisp other times they aren't. Another plus is that they are also featured on grub hub and therefore deliver. No complaints from me :)

I love the atmosphere here ! From ping pong ,corn hole to the bar I'm a fan. Culinary Dropout/ the Yard is right down the street from my apartment so I can walk there and not worry about parking. Like most bar/restaurants around the mill ave area parking sucks. So be prepared! The seating within the restaurant is comfortable and eclectic. The crowd is diverse as well !   Service : Interesting to say the least ! She kept walking off in the middle of us ordering.   I  really could care less about service as long as you are bringing me my food.    Food : Pretzel and cheese fondue pretty damn good. The pork belly ramen was pretty bland. Then again I like my ramen spicy!   Pricing : Slightly more expensive than most of the restaurants in downtown Tempe. But the atmosphere makes up for the expensiveness in my mind. Also It's one of the nicest places in the area other than La Bocca and House of tricks.  Keep in mind this location is still pretty new , so they are still working out the kinks. Be kind :) and check it out !
