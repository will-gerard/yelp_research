Absolutely love the casual personalized service. These people are experts and I would not trust my Kirby wo anyone else! (so glad I stopped falling for Dyson marketing and went with a real vacuum!)  Always love to give my money to local shops!

I love the atmosphere and the food. Not a fan of beer or wine as my only options. And I hate forced valet parking. If it weren't for the forced valet parking I would visit more often.

In and out in 10 minutes flat (On a Monday at 10AM). Took me longer to drive there. Needed a new card. The security guard was friendly (and adorable!) and the agent who assisted me (Gloria) was just the sweetest!

It's not worth taking your VW anywhere else! This is just one of the best places of business in existence! Love love love everyone there. The expertise and professionalism are hands-down the greatest anywhere.  Wish I had found them years ago!!!!!

We have mostly had good experiences here but last night was so awful so here's my review.   Two $7 margaritas and I walked out completely sober. (Tried two different ones even!)  The waitress, Amber, tried to explain to me some frat bullshit she was told about having a drink that was cold, sweet, and sour and how you therefore don't taste the alcohol. I am usually toast after a half of one of the Top Shelf margaritas...and no joke, I could have passed any field sobriety test.  She was an awful waitress to begin with - although not intentionally - she just seemed to be way over her head and have some sort of short term memory problem.  She did however do what she could to make sure we left barely happy - but still charging me for $7 margaritas that I disliked was crap.  We are done with that place and that will be absolutely the last time we go back.

I'm not sure how these gentlemen stay in business. They are rude and overpriced. I've gone in a couple times and they may or may not even bother getting up out of their chair.   Walked past the huge "WE BUY GOLD" sign to sell a gold ring I have. When I told them I had a ring to sell he said we don't buy gold.  Wha??  I live in the neighborhood and like to support local businesses but this will not be one of them.

What a horrific experience! I almost left in tears. Lured in by a Groupon and decent reviews, I arrived on time for my 9AM appointment. Twenty minutes later the receptionist was asking me personal medical questions IN FRONT OF OTHER CLIENTS! When I'm introduced to "the nurse" I'm taken to a room and told to "drop your pants" so she can look at the spider veins I wants treated. No robe, no privacy, no decency...nothing! The discounted prices are NOT worth it. Go elsewhere and fast!

I absolutely love this place! The staff and owner are so great. Great location, great seating. Coffee is wonderful and the prices are realistic. Great variety to choose from to drink or snack on, or to eat.

Well, I have to update and change my review. The place has changed drastically. At first it was for the better but now, well, it's a great place to hold your Bible studies and conduct your business (at the top of your lungs on your cellphone) with no regard for anyone else around you.  It's now owned by a church-based "nonprofit". So as long as you don't mind hearing all the preaching going on around you by other customers, this place is for you!  The food is way overpriced but the coffee is good and decently-priced.  The staff is super friendly.

Just can't do it anymore. The place is a circus. The owner released the two men who knew anything about running a business and now it's just......  Bummer, it was my only real independently owned coffee shop anywhere near me. I'd rather force myself to learn to love McDonald's coffee.  Great for your bible study groups though; complete with blaring Christian music all the bible thumpers have to scream over.   I've gone through this business watching it change hands a few times and now it is time for me to exit.

Amazing food! Great service - if you don't mind scantily clad chicks serving you.

The place is brand new and still really empty. We are always seen right away, sometimes before I'm done with the paperwork. Amazing staff!

Nobody is thrilled about spending an entire Saturday in a classroom - especially over a holiday weekend - but Mr. Camden blew me away with his knowledge and effectiveness at teaching the material. He added great supplementary statistics to each section and engaged the class perfectly.   Only suggestion - a one-time use CPR barrier should be included with the registration fee WITHOUT raising the fee itself. I imagine the mannequins have a cost to them and I hope you pay the instructors decently, but the facilities leave something to be desired.  I hope to find Mr. Camden next year when I renew my cards.

I came to this location several times when it was a coffee shop. At that time the decor was wonderful but the people were emotionless assholes and the prices were too high.  Breakfast food is my favorite and I have seen this place several times. No clue when it opened because never saw any cars when I drove by.  Today was different. The parking lot was virtually packed. When I walked in the first words out of my worth were, "They ruined it!"  It's drab drab drab....cheap crap tables and chairs, bland walls, some leftover decor.  The server was amazingly friendly and attentive - other than forgetting the strawberry jam we specifically requested.   The food was delicious - the pancakes AMAZING! As were the veggie omelets.  This place completely redeemed itself with the food.  Bravo!  Will return.

Was looking for a new breakfast place because The Good Egg just isn't cutting it anymore. Have driven past this little place tons of time never considered stopping till I found it listed here on Yelp.  Excellent menu. Great service. The food is incredible! Got the Frosted Flakes crusted French Toast. (yes, it is as absurd as it sounds.)  Here's my new breakfast place near home!
