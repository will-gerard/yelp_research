It's bad when you introduce your boyfriend to a usually great restaurant for the first time on his BIRTHDAY, to receive absolutely terrible service.   We went in around 5:30ish on 8/16/15 to this location and got seated right away. Our server (male, medium build, dirty blonde short hair, scruff) provided us excellent service for our drinks and appetizer, but it definitely went south when it came to our main course. We waited for an hour for our dinner, when people that were seated after us, received their meal. We knew something was wrong up to the 30 minute mark, and the server apologized for the wait (his excuse was busy kitchen) and offered us a soup/salad on the house (we took one cup of soup). It was a nice gesture, but it was blatantly obvious he forgot to put our order in (or it was completely wrong and he caught it before serving us). When we finally got our order, my meat balls were lukewarm, but my boyfriend had no complaint with his order.  I have worked in the restaurant industry since I was 14, and I totally understand that everyone is human, and especially on a busy night, people make mistakes. What I didn't appreciate was what we got in exchange for his mistake. If I was in his position, knowing he was serving someone on his birthday, I would have at least comped the cheese cakes...I really didn't want to be that person that screams over their meal, but I thought for being so nice about everything, he would try to do some kind of a discount on our meal, and not some "free soup" that we didn't order in the first place.  I am embarrassed because this was my boyfriend's birthday dinner. He definitely doesn't want to go again.  Again, I realize people make mistakes, but it would have been nice to get some type of discount, especially for taking it so well. Our gratuity wasn't so nice, because of it.  :-(

I would not recommend this place. While the office is asthetically pleasing, they really are there strictly for profit. I signed documents saying that they can provide results within a voicemail for my annual pap, but they called shortly after saying I needed to come in for a follow up to go over the results. They said the nurses "do not take phone calls", so I had to fork out $$ just for a 5 minute appointment that could have totally been explained in a 30 second phone call. I WILL NOT be coming back and I highly recommend you to find someone else to see.  Their bedside manner sucks too. Just don't waste your money here.

I love small business and I love Ann!! I had never gotten a spray tan before, so you could image that I was so happy to have Ann do her magic! My tans are always FLAWLESS, and I always get compliments on how natural it looks. Skip those spray machines, and schedule an appointment here! You will not be disappointed!
