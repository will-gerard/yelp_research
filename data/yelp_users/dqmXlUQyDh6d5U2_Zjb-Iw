First time at this location.  Parking down town was a challenge , I first thought we could Park on the street but there were signs asking for a special permit . The restaurant was very slow maybe 4 tables.  Service was slow which did not make sense . The prices were reasonable and portions were large . We love their jack Daniel barbecue.  The ribs were delicious.

They now accepting credit cards . Don't go close to their closing . They were extremely busy. Try mixing the green burro with beans for those who do not like it that spicy.  They have the best refried beans . Also try their tacos

The course I s in good shape . The greens look slow but  are running around a 9 . The pace of plat was right at 4 hours but could have been 10 minutes faster.the cart girls were coming around every three holes. Drinks are a little on the expensive side . There is water available on the front and  before the 10 th hole.there are numerous beautiful homes on the course.  The sand traps did have rocks . The course is reasonably priced for the summer

They have a great special  6 rounds for about 150 including the wigwam.  The course is in great shape.  Pace of play is normally great but we got stuck behind a group that was not familiar with the course.  Greens are hard to read and a little slow. We still got done in about 4 hours

Haven't  been to the  restaurant  in ten years. We started  with the egg drop soup . It was warm but had no flavor. The egg rolls were very oily . The crab puffs were much better with plenty of cream cheese . We then tried  the garlic chicken and shrimp  . It was half onions. The chicken  was too dry and only a couple of ship which tasted old . The louse chow me in was better but oily . The food had too much msg. Service was good but there were no customers.  I will  pass on this restaurant

This place is a hole in the wall. My niece goes there regularly  so we decided to try it . The staff was not that friendly. Prices are reasonable.  We tried their pro with steak and brisket . The portion  was large but the soup did not have much flavor. The meat was very fatty and not much meat. Also tried their fried rice . It was oily and the pork was overcooked.  We did like their  desert macro on with ice cream. Food came quickly.

This place is the best  restaurant for dim sum . Better get there early or the line will be an hour.  Dim sum is like eating little pastries.  Most are salty.

First time trying  the restaurant.  We made reservations  and was seated promptly.  We waited for our third  guest who was a little  late . This allowed  us to discuss  some business  . They were pushing  their  wine list . And appetizers.  My guest  ordered  a flat bread which was a little  soggy and salty probably  the cheese.  I tried their short ribs which was too saucy . The ribs were overcooked  not like what was promised.  They were slow is refilling our water. Finally tried their pecan pie . It was OK not great

This is a beautiful and we'll manicured golf course.  It is quite a drive to get there and a ten minute drive to get to the first hole . There are only about 6 homes on the entire course.  There are many  holes with tremendous elevation changes on the par threes. It is a tough course but fair. There are very few players and the pace of play is good unless your game is off. Their food is excellent and reasonably priced

Went to my first cardinal game . The roads to get to the  stadium   was very busy. Once we got  to the stadium was well organized we got in quickly.  The security was tight to get in with several people checking our tickets to get on the escalators.  We sat in the club seats which were large and comfortable . The view was great and enhanced with the large screens in the end zones . The food  was actually very good . Tried their pasta bar for 12. The crowd was loud which made for a great atmosphere cheating on the cardinals.  Had a good experience

I have played the course several times. It is a good drive to get there but the course is normally not packed. If you stray from the fairway it can be punishing. .there are a few holes with blind spots  so a gps would be helpful. The course is interesting and is not for beginners. If you have a bad slice prepare to retee. The  price is normally fair . Their food is very good , large portions and reasonably priced. I would definitely return

They were light and fluffy with a Chipotle sauce . I had the lobster roll which was average. Their  steak fries were very good. . They gave us a free ice cream and fresh cookie. Service was good . We also had the macaroni and cheese with lobster. This may be their signature dish

We like their  lobster pastry  it was nice and fluffy.also tried their  fried chicken  which consisted  of chicken  breast it was  on the dry side . The sauce  was underwhelming.  The lobster mac and cheese  was good but the order came out late . Meal was spaced with ample  time . . They comp us desert. Service was a little  slow. We do like their  food

Parking was not an issue . They allowed  us to check in 4 hours early  with no charges. Lines were not long . The room was newly decorated  and very large with two televisions. Bathroom was nicer than my home . With both a tub and shower and separate  toilet area. There was a security guard by the elevator  to ensure safety.  There rooms were nicer than the Caesars  palace

This place is scary and dingy and dark. They do have good specials wings and pizza . We love their stromboli. They do deliver. Their pizza sometimes the bottom crust is a little  burnt. We like their sausage  and Hawaii pizza

Tried the restaurant  for the first time yesterday.  Went for breakfast  at 6.00 but they were not open  till 7.00. The operator  for wigwam told us the hours of operation.  For lunch  we had their  burgers . I tried to order the AZ burger but the waitress  insisted that we tried the burger with gouda cheese. I hated my burger because of the cheese. The burgers took 20 minutes  to be served  and we were starving.  The waitress  was  friendly  but I tried  three times  to order the order  the other burger.  The place was about 60 % filled

It was late and we got there just before closing . First tried their wanton soup. The waitress  bragged about  the soup. The skin was a little  thick . The meat was dry was taste less. Tried their beff pastry roll. This was passable not much flavor and dry. We ordered two noodle dishes. They were both overcooked. I would pass on this restaurant  . The service was good otherwise  one star

I am on a low carb diet. It is difficult to find something besides their salad. I  ordered their chicken salad and half of ironwood sanwich. Salad was very tasty with a sweet raspberry dressing . I am glad that they put in on the side. The sandwich on the other hand was missing something . It came with turkey only. Disappointed

I love the fact that happy hour is available  most of the day  . The place is small but always busy . I like their combination plates their California  rolls are the best in town .

This was highly  recommended by friends.  There was no wait to get in the staff was friendly  and eager to please. We were not extremely  hungry and split  a hamburger  . The burger  was huge  and very easy to share. Fries were nice and hot and very  well  seasoned. We finished  with  a strawberry  milkshake . Food was good but a little  pricey.

The golf course is well manicured.  The  club.house is  beautiful.  Spectacular  views . Friendly  staff . Greens are fast but  hard to read . . The course  is very challenging.  It is about 7 degrees cooler  than the city. It is worth  the drive. We had a great time there . We played  in the golf tournament  shot 32 under with handicap  but came in tied for second

Their service is so poor. I was on hold for 45 minutes  after being transferred  3 times . The call dropped  so I drove  to the store  . I was told there would  be a 25 minutes  wait. It took them an hour and 10 minutes  wait . Several  of their  employees were watching  the football game . The lady who checked  me in was visiting  with a customer  for 20 minutes  after  she had taken care of her customer  right next to me

This place has expanded  twice and now seats 200 customers  . The place is busy but food  cones out quickly. We normally order 113 noodles  with beef filet. The portions are large. And the soup very flavorful. We also love their  salty  fish fried rice. You have to try the fresh coconut water. You need to get there early .

We golfed yesterday . It was cart only . The course was wet and muddy. The rough was very tall and thick . It was almost impossible to find your ball  we lost about a dozen balls . The ground was wet so it was very inconsistent . The greens  were relatively  smooth and about an 8 it was a lot of walking  shot my highest round in years

This place has great reviews. It is in a small  shopping  center and outside  the restaurant  looks like a dive. Inside  is much more pleasant . The place has room for only 70 . Service was quick and our order of 6 dishes came quickly.  I did not like rhe fried wanton or the stuffed chicken  wings.  I liked the spicy green beans , it was barely cooked that is how I like my vegatables. I also liked their garlic shrimp. It was loaded with garlic and basil. Their pad Thai was average. Portion was small. We also had their coconut  ice  cream with sticky  rice this was interesting.  I would rate the restaurant  3.5 stars . What I did not like that the added 20 % tip and then brought  the  charge slip that did not show the tip. I will  try again but it is not the best Thai restaurant  in town

I took my family for the first time to try their burgers and salads.  We started with an order or zucchini and then their sweet potato fries.  We were hungry and both of the appetizers were great . I would suggest the ranch dressing. Their salads were large enough to feed two persons . I tried the hamburger with grilled jalapeños and jack cheese and grilled onions.  The blend of all the flavors were great . Only suggestion would be to get the nuns toasted.  The waitress and staff were very attentive

The dished was  full of seafood from mussels squids fish and shrimp.  . We  had their lady fingers which was so ri h . They did comp desert because the kitchen was so slow

It has been two and half years  since I was last there. The selection was less there were several selections that were out. There was no duck. The fried rice had no meet. There was only one choice of noodles.the service was slow and they only came by once in an hour.  Several of the dishes were sitting for one hour on the place was overcooked.    The place was more like a 9.00 buffet.  The noodles we did have was not gre but did not have any flavor.  I tried to get ice cream but the line was too long

The hot sauce was mild but had good flavor.  We tried the guacamole with Serrano peppers. The peppers were mild . We really liked their grilled corn on the cobb. By the time I got to my burrito I was full . I had the steak burrito.  . Service was good except for the end when it came to get the bill and pay

I would have liked it better if it was shredded in to smaller pieces with a little more oil and onions but that is how I remembered the dish from my childhood days.  The owners are friendly . We tried their sorrel. Which is a fruit drink . We did like  it always love their roti and curry chicken

We arrived at 6.24 and request  a table for three . There was a quoted 30 minute wait however  the restaurant  had empty tables. We were seated in 23 minutes  however  the host did not realize  that the ground  had water all on the ground  . We stood while  he mopped  the ground. We were hungry . They took our order after 5 minutes which was good . However  the pizza did not get to our table for 45 minutes  which was too long . They came and apologize  three times but offered nothing for our wait . We asked for take out boxes and this took another  7 minutes  all in all two hours  for dinner. The food was good  but we were very unhappy  with the wait.  I don't think we will  be  going back soon

This is a knock off of Chipotle.  The price is reasonable  for the location . The portion is resonably  large and more than enough  food for one person . The steak was not overcooked. The black beans were nice and firm same for the rice. Hot sauce was so bland. The  guacamole  was too sour. Service was ok

I had dinner  on Sunday  . We waited 25 minutes  however  there were several  empty tables. Not sure why  the wait was so long. I tried the gumbo which was interesting  it had a lot of ocra which made the soup a little  slimy but it was tasty and spicy. We also had the fish poor boy.  Which was large  enough  for two . We had both the two star and the four star trifecta. Plenty of food and good service.

It had been 5 years since  I have been in one of the restaurants.  They now serve breakfast from 7.00 am to 11.00 . The price for breakfast  seems reasonable  . I came by at 11.05 and they were not ready for lunch . I had to wait for 12 minutes  before I could order a sandwich to go . Prices were about 20% higher.  But portions were large and the pastrami  very very good . The place is smaller  but much cleaner . The menu has quite a few desserts.

Tried  for the first time . My daughter  picked the place . It is very casual  . The menu is similar  to zinburger. Their is a line to order which was slow . The meals took about 20 minutes  but the Diablo burger was good  and spicy fresh harbeneros. Fries were plenty.  Also tried the shake which was good . Only complaint  was the time . Server keep coming by often. There is tables  outside  which accommodates pets. I will  be back

I decided to give the restaurant another opportunity to change my opinion . The waiter was friendly But  there was no bread that came out as a appetizer . The service was slow. I tried their green fried tomatoes poorboy with jam . This was tasteless.  The gumbo again had no vegables and was too salty.  I ordered a cup and just got the side .This place needs a lot or changes
