This place is an attraction in itself. The food was amazing. I had the chicken tenders and could only eat one they were so big. My husband had the BBQ sliders I had a taste and they were amazing. They play alot of the 80's early 90 hair band music which I like and if you are a sports fan they have a ton of TV's to watch the game. It is within walking distance to Chase Field also so its pretty easy to get to before or after a game.

This is in regards to store # 11 located at 4855 E. Warner Rd, Phoenix, AZ 85044. I have shopped at this Bashas for over 7 years. Today took the cake. It started at the Deli, I order the 8 piece chicken meal, and I would like to first and foremost state the girl who served me was excellent. I also wanted to get some chicken salad but there were no prices on any of the items so she found what she thought was the price and she quoted me 5.99 a lb. OK perfect As she was getting it for me her coworker called her out in front of everyone saying she misquoted you its 7.99 but she will honor the price. I was ok with that but to be called out for a mistake like that is very unprofessional. Now comes the biggest issue. Upon checking out with cashier 0135, Eva store #11 I gave her a coupon for Coke Cola which clearly stated .77 a bottle with my rewards card MAX 6. After we were done I checked my receipt and saw she only took off 1.22 for Coke which would equal only 1 bottle. 1.99-1.22=.77. Perhaps she should stop commenting on everything I bought and pay attention.  I took my receipt up to customer service and cashier #501, who I really hope was not the manager.  I explained what happened he immediately takes my receipt and goes all the back to the Coke aisle to verify the price. While he was doing that I simply went and got a copy of the ad with coupon so I could show him. He comes back and tells me it's a MAX of 5. I show him the coupon to prove I was telling the truth it's a MAX of 6 so according to my calculations 1.22*5=6.10. As I am showing him this he is quickly working the register and tries to give me back a 1.99. My husband at this point is losing his patience and has to correct him and tell him No... 1.22 Per bottle discount times 5 is 6.10. Finally the guy gives me my refund.  Can you please tell me why I have to do your employees jobs for them? Why should I continue to shop at Bashas when Albertsons and Frys are just are close and have better service.

Really great Subway. We went in today and we were helped by a young man I think his name was Kory. He greeted us as soon as we we walked in and I ordered the 2.00 Cold Cut Combo , he was very fast and asked me as he went down the line what I wanted. He even told my husband if he wanted a foot long they were on special for 4.00 and he made the sandwich just they way my husband wanted, all while greeting every customer as they walked in the door. I will definately go back again , it was very clean and they even had all the fresh baked cookies

Below is the complaint I wrote to IHOPS Corporate headquarters: We came in on the above date for lunch. We walked in and there was a party of like 8 in front of us who were waiting for a table. The hostess comes to the front, does not even acknowledge us and tells the party their table is ready. Ok so she seats that party and we continue to wait. After 10 minutes we walked out she never came back to the front and never even acknowledged we were there. The location was pretty empty also so being busy is not an excuse. She was a young thin girl with brown or black long hair and I think she was wearing a black shirt. I guess IHOP lost my business I will go to Dennys from now on. She should be fired. This was the location on Ray Rd right off I-10 in Phoenix. So tell me why should I try IHOP again?

I visited this location on 12/16/2014 4:59pm. I purchased a few items and went to checkout. The check out girl , I do not recall her name but she had purple hair, seemed in a rush to leave. She was telling the guest in front of me , when she was asked if she was ready for Christmas that her last paycheck was only 60.00 and how was she suppose to buy gifts with that. Wow! ok so maybe Target doesn't pay that well, but that is not my issue. My issue is I presented her with 4 coupons and when I asked did you take all 4 off she said yes, without even looking at her screen.  I got my receipt and sure enough she left off one of the coupons. It's not about the dollar, trust me , if the fact she did not bother to double check and I did not want to hold up a line espically at this time in the season.  Looking at the receipt there is no receipt number or name or anything to show who checked me out. All I can tell you is she had purple hair and it was long. I am going to post this on yelp also. I used to love Target but this experience made me think you are guys are just like Walmart now and that is sad.

I have been in this store more times in the last 2 months than I like to admit . First I switched all my lines over from Verizon to Sprint for the 100.00 a month for up to 10 lines. I wont waste your time reading a big story , basically when you go in here the wait time is insane. Then when you purchase an item its like buying a used car they assume you are going to buy accessories and push the insurance on you . I went in yesterday to add another IPAD to my account. Usually I deal with one of the guys , but  I went in and of course had about a 45 minutes wait. Finally the girl calls my name and asked pretty much What did I want. I told her I wanted to add an IPAD she pulls up my account and then goes in the back to get the IPAD. 10 minutes goes by and I am still waiting for her to come back, I see the floor supervisor Zack and asked where she went . He said they are out of stock and she is calling around looking for another store who would send it to there store. First off why not just come out and tell me we are out of stock would you like me to check another store . Instead I sat there wondering where she went. Finally she comes out to tell me they did not have the IPAD. I told her forget it I will just call customer service to order one. Long behold I find out since the new Ipad came out there is a 1-4 week wait on it. However... I was able to find one at another store. I called and they had one, she held it for I drove  over and I was in and out in 20 minutes,

I had to update on my latest experience.  Back on Sept 20 I ordered an Iphone 6 plus 64gb. I have waited and waited for it since I needed it before I leave town . I called today  and had to try for 2 hours for someone to answer the phone, no joke no one picked up from 1:00pm till 3:00pm, finally David answered the phone. He checked and my phone actually came in, I told him I needed to simply do a return since I had to get a 16 gb because of the time crunch. He asked me when I would be able to come down I said tommorow because I have alot to do with getting ready to go out of town. He said great come in at 9am and ask for David, he seemed eager to help me. He then says, "You are adding another line right" I then said no, I am simply doing a return. Then he says oh a return well come in at 9:30 Alfonso should be in to help you with that. I could not bite my tongue on this , I said to him 'So because I am returning a device now I cant come in until 9:30, I will still be there at 9. Its funny how his attitude changed because he found out he wouldn't be getting commission on it.   I actually went in right after my phone call and of course waited for 45 minutes, I will say the girl who helped me I believe her name was Tatiana, she was very nice and helpful.

I went in here yesterday to upgrade my phone. I will admit I was skeptical I have heard and read horror stories of people trying to upgrade a device with Sprint.  When I walked in I was greeted by Marissa. This girl was great ! She knew what I was talking about and what I wanted. She did not try to hard sell me on any of the extra crap. I mean she did offer extras , but I declined and she was ok with it. She got me my iPhone 6 and set it up for me , did the test call and got my contacts over all in less than an hour. The only reason it was an hour is because the phone was dead when she pulled it out of the box and I wanted to make sure it charged so we stayed for a few for it to charge it. It did and it works great. I would recommend going to this store for your needs and deal with Marissa. She is a true asset to Sprint.

Honesty.. its the first word that comes to mind. I was at Firestone and to get a battery and they told me I needed to get 2 new back tires because the tred was low. I told them I would take my car to Discount Tires because I have a warranty and wanted to inquire how it works. I had to wait a bit they were super busy , then I spoke to Brian. He was super nice and let me tell you the customer he had before me.. what a piece of work and yet he was still smiling.  While I was talking to Brian explaining my situation his boss came out and I told him how patient Brian was with the guy before me and if that was me I would have jumped over the counter and rung that guys neck, but I digress...  We go outside Brian checks my tires and tells me, Firestone lied you dont need new tires you still have 5-10,000 miles on these. What repair place do you go to and they tell you , you don't need to spend money? I asked him about driving my car to California and he said just stop by for a tire rotation and it is free. :) Now that is service !

Wow !  We went here for my birthday dinner on 2/19. Our server was Vicki . She was amazing! From the start she was so nice and when my friend asked a question about an entrée she went into so much detail down to each kind of pasta he could order and how it is shaped.  The food was amazing. My husband ordered the 4 course meal for 15.99. The breadsticks and salad alone can fill you up. The entrée was the mozzarella chicken and it was so good. I shared with my husband since I can not eat a whole meal and we still had leftovers to bring home. I will definitely go back here again.

We went through the drive thru last night we got there at 11:15, whomever was working the window served the car in front of us, ( mind you all the lights in the drive thru were on and the board was all lite up. We pull up to place our order and waited...and waited for 5 minutes and no one came on to take our order. Finally we pulled up to the window and we see the employees all in the back , looks like they were having a good old time. Needless to say they lost a customer last night. Kind of sad for a Taco Bell, that shows on here they are open until midnight.

I came in around 6:30 pm on Wednesday March 16, 2016 to purchase a car audio system. We waited about 10 minutes for someone to help us and finally a gentleman came over . I would like to start out with her was very helpful and very nice so this is not about him. It was obvious he was either new or never order a stereo before as the process took us over an hour . He tried to send us out without paying for what we ordered but we asked him to double check to make sure. Sure enough there was a step he forgot. In spite of the issues I spent over 600.00 on the new stereo and equipment. Next we went over to the cell phones and this is where it was beyond horrible. There was 1 guy working , Nick was his name and there were a few customers. He made it clear he did not want to be there and even said he should leave now because it is not his dept. All we wanted to do is to see if my husband would qualify for Verizon service. He had a guy named Sean help my husband and Sean did not even work for Best Buy he was a Samsung rep who happened to be there and had no idea what he was doing but he tried. After he ran it I sat down where Nick was waiting my turn but you could clearly see he did not want to be there by the look he gave me when I sat down. With that being said I walked out and went to the Verizon store instead only to learn Sean gave my husband the wrong information. Overall it was a horrible shopping trip and dont think I will use Best Buy in the future, I have an appointment for the install on my car on March 26, at 10 am we will see how that goes.

Late last night my one dog was bit by my other dog by her eye. I was panicking because her eye was bleeding I called my vet Banfield and the recording reffered me to VCA. I called and spoke to Sarah who was so nice, she told me to bring her in right now since it was her eye it could progress . My husband and I drove like a bat out of hell from Tempe to Mesa and they got us right into a room. We saw Dr. Brian and he her out and advised us she is just fine. They checked her eye out and there is no damage. They gave her some antibiotics because she also had a gash on her back , where they shaved her fur and cleaned her up. I would definitely recommend VCA. They really cam through in an emergency.

Fastest experience ever in a Sprint store! Hex was amazing! I called to see if they had any Ipads in stock. She had one. She held it for me I went it she hooked it up, no high pressure sales . I was in and out in 15 minutes.  I will drive the extra 20 minutes and deal with this store from now on.

I wanted a chicken quesadilla for lunch today so my husband went to get me one. When I got home I started eating it and discovered it tasted weird. I opened it up and there was NO chicken and barely any cheese . I called them and the girl said they would remake it and I asked for sour cream on the side. They even made my husband return the messed up one I had already bit into. He gets home this time they didn't give me sour cream . I gave up at that point . Doubt I will go back .

I went here for the 1st time today they were having a special for their anniversary buy 1 Jewish slider get one 1/2 price.  We got there right around 10:45 am and we seated really fast. Our waitress I forgot her name but she was awesome! She came and took the drink order and brought them fast. My husband had the sliders and he loved them. I had the Matzo Ball soup, not that I wouldn't have died for a slider but I just had surgery and cant eat them . I didn't even finish my soup.  Our waitress was nice enough to offer us to go containers and even gave us Ice Tea and my husband soda to go. She was very prompt and efficient. I will definately go back once I am able to actually eat and enjoy what they have to offer.

My fur babies love it here. I board Bingo and Maggie here all the time and we have been going here for 5 years. The staff is very caring and the owner Chad is very nice. When my fur babies come home they look good and healthy. I do not do the play time simply because my dogs only play with each other and we get a large suite for them. I did do play a few times in the past I would get a kick out of watching them on the cam. The only downfall is when you are on vacation yet you know you can see your babies on the cam you tend to want to be at the laptop all the time. LOL

I have had no issues with Delta out of PHX. Every flight has been on time and my luggage is always waiting for me when I get off the place. The employees I have encountered at Sky Harbor are always friendly and smiling.  The best time to fly out is on a Wednesday evening you have a better chance of the flight not being as full.  Since they depart out of terminal 2 , it is less congested and easier than having to deal with American out of terminal 4.

Was in here today to purchase 3 things. I had a coupon for 1.00 off of Purex Cystals and I had used one the other day with no problem. I got to the cashier and the coupon would not scan, so she proceeds to read the whole thing word for word then tells me I got the wrong size. There is no size on the coupon, like I said I used the same one a few days ago.  She calls over her manager who tells me if the computer does not recognize it they do not take it. I said "Seriously" and her manager turns around to me and says "Yeah Seriously" ..No I am sorry . nothing . She did override and took the dollar off and when I said Thank You she just walked away. It's not about the dollar it's about the customer service and how rude this manager was .

This review is based on their billing practices only and their corp offices on Washington was not listed so I picked where I go for labs. This is a copy of the letter I sent to the BBB in regards to their billing. I am also contacting the AZ attorney general On Wednesday August 20, 2014 I went in to get my blood drawn like I have been doing every month for the last year from your location at 16515 S. 40th Street, Ste. #113 in Phoenix. After waiting 15 minutes the lady working in billing called me up and presented with a bill from 2013 for 2,965.32. I was in shock as I go in every month and this was never brought to my attention. She then proceeds to tell me they will not provide me services until the bill is paid.  I look at the address on the bill and it is completely wrong they don't have my apt. number on it and I had moved. I advised the billing lady that I updated my address online with you back in August of 2013 and she was quite rude and didn't want to be bothered she pushed me off to your billing dept. I have End Stage Renal Failure and Sonora Quest is the only laboratory on my insurance and every bill this year has been submitted and paid by insurance.  Last year my job let me go because I was on LTD because of kidney failure and they advised me my insurance was good until Nov. 2013. I only later found out it was cancelled in August of 2013.  On Wednesday when she presented me the bill 2 ascensions were already in collection and 2 were not. I called customer service on Thursday August 21, 2014 and spoke to Kurt whom when I advised him of my situation, advised me he could make payment arrangements for 5 months which is almost 600.00 in order for me to continue to receive services from Sonora Quest. I get 1,000 once a month from disability. I cannot afford that. Kurt then promised me he would speak to his supervisor to see what he could do to make the payments affordable and he would call me back. HE NEVER CALLED ME BACK. I call back today and Kurt answered again, now I am told all the accessions are now in collections and they just rolled over so now I have to go to the lab to pay 50 percent of the balance to receive services from you guys. When I told him had you called me back when you said these would have not also went into collections. His response, "It is what it is" "go to Lab Corp" and "how would you have paid it if I called you back" First off Kurt is the WORST representative I have ever spoke to.  I admit I have a bill to pay but Sonora Quest has dropped the ball for the following reasons: 1. You sent the bill to the wrong address even though I updated it with you and its funny RSI has the correct address. All my mail was forwarded also because I received 2 bills from you months ago from the same time frame and they got to me and I paid them. 2. Why was I not informed of this debt when I go in EVERY month for bloodwork? Why was it almost a year later that I am informed? 3. Since KURT never called me as promised the other 2 ascensions are now in collections because he dropped the ball and never even apologized. 4. You provide a lifesaving service how can you not may arrangements more affordable for people and deny them services? Hospitals and Doctors all make arrangements. It is because of Sonora Quests negligence I was not able to address these bills in a timely fashion.  I don't even know the name of the girl who does the billing at location she does not wear a name tag. By the grace of god I was able to pay 50 percent of my bill and make arrangements with RSI to pay the rest and now able to receive services from you guys since you are the only ones on my insurance. I am also sending a copy of this to the AZ Attorney General in regards to your billing practices and the way you treat customers who need your services. I want action taken against Kurt got the way I was treated on the phone and the fact he never followed with me.

I went in her yesterday to trade my dads cell phone in after I called customer service and was advised that it was the 14th day and I had to get there before the store closed. I went in and waited 30 minutes . Finally Rory comes over and I explain what I want to do. He immediately tells me its over 14 days its 15 days. He then proceeds to ask his manager if they can make an exception . He comes back and says we can help you . Great! I pick out the iPhone 5c and I am on the edge program. So he starts the transaction and then Rory comes up to me and says because its over 14 days we can not do the exchange you have to pay full price. Then I proceed to say but you said your manager would make the exception . He got very rude and said I did not say that. I asked to speak to his manager and he disappeared for 10 minutes and comes back without his manager . Stating there is nothing we can do for. Rory was the worse sales person I ever encountered and will be writing Verizon's Executive Customer Relations. I have never been treated so poorly before in my life. Avoid this store at all costs. Order over the phone.

We purchased 2 cases On Wednesday and they did not work out for us. Their return policy states 7 days . We went to the kiosk in the Chandler Mall and returned the items. The person there some guy was not happy we were returning the items. I told him they did not work for us and he made a snide comment. Then he made a phone call on his cell phone , which he did not speak English. After he finally processed the return he gives me the receipt and tells me "Do not come back here I do not wan to sell to you again". I was floored. I have contacted the corporate headquarters as well as Mall security and filed a formal complaint against him. According to my receipt his name was S ( Rubel) but that could have been whoever was signed into the IPAD they use. Do not ever go to this location.

I used Creative movers to move my 1 bedroom apt to another 1 bed apt. I was so scared the move would be horrible. I am so glad I was wrong! Aurturo and Lorenzo were great. The showed up on time and we're very polite and curteous. Nothing was damaged and they even fixed my dresser I got from IKEA that I screwed up . I highly recommend this company. From my first call with Jesse everything was smooth and professional.

Horrible. I had a package that showed delivered on 1/31. Usually my carrier takes any packages that do not fit in my mailbox to my office and I pick them up.  I got a notification from the company that my package was delivered but no one at my office had it and it was not in my mailbox. I called USPS customer service and was given a case number. Later that afternoon my postal carrier called me and stated she was off that day but would look into it. Fine, after a few days I did not hear anything I called customer service again only to find out their supervisor closed the case, simply as "Carrier will call customer" there was no resolution. I had them reopen the case. Fast forward a week later my package shows up in my mailbox and I get a nasty voicemail from Dicey or whatever the supervisor names is there that "I need to check with the leasing office they have it and misplaced it" Um no they didn't. I have a number given to me by customer service and I am making a formal complaint against this location specifically the supervisor. This is not the first time she has spoke to me in a condescending way , I let it slide the other times but she is down right rude.

Brian is my all time favorite employee. When ever I go in he always recognizes me and greets me , always smiling. He always asks how I am doing and I tell him all about what's going on with me. He processes my transaction fast and I never have a problem.

I had my car in for repairs and my insurance company hooked me up with a rent a car, through this location.  They picked me up from the collision center in this really cool Nissan Leaf car and then Brittney helped me with my car. As far a customer service goes she was amazing. She came out with me checked the car, explained everything to me and got me on my way. I had to wait a few minutes for the car but that is perfectly fine they were super busy on a Monday morning. I returned the car today and Brittney greeted me outside, and check in the car and then set me up with Justin to drive me back to the collision center. Justin was great we chatted the whole way back . I am moving so this won't be my closest Enterprise anymore but I would definately rent from the again .

I found this place on Groupon and what a great find. It is nothing fancy but it reminds me of the diners we have back in the Northeast. The service is fast and friendly and the food is really good. The portion sizes are pretty big. They also give out coupons so it makes it very affordable to eat here .

I used these people back in August of 2013. I am just going through paperwork and I found my letter to the attorney general that I wrote about them. I was quoted a price over the phone and when they moved me they charged me over 100.00 more.  They put on the invoice they had to pack boxes which was a lie and they scratched out the time on their copy that the ended when I questioned the extra time. I faxed over my copy and the copy they had and you can clearly see where the fixed it on their receipt. I dealt with a guy name Lamar over there who writes a letter like a 5 year old. They offered me a 20.00 gift card to make up for the trouble and guess what I never saw it. STAY AWAY FROM THESE PEOPLE.

Love this place! My mom has been going here for years and I just moved up to the area so I have taken one of my dogs there and Carmen gave her the cutest haircut. She does a fantastic job. Also the owner Dorothy is a pleasure to deal with . It is a smaller shop but you get personalized service.

We had a Groupon for this place so we decided since we were on the east side of the valley today we would try it out. It pretty much is a bar , lots of sports on different TV's, and waitresses wearing barely nothing. The service was ok , I ordered the BBQ Chicken Sandwhich hold the onion rings. I guess if you like food with a little kick then this is your place. The BBQ was good but a little too spicy for me , even the French fries tasted odd.  When it came time to pay we noticed the waitress did not take off the groupon so we had to ask her to re ring the check, which she happily did. Overall not my kind of place , but if you like food with a little kick, loud music and lots of beer, then you will enjoy this place.

Just went here for the 1st time. LeKisha was great. The salon is very clean and it is very quiet. She took her time and was very friendly and a pleasure to work with. There are not smelly chemicals, as she uses all Gel. She takes her time and is a perfectionist. Call ahead she books up quick!

I wanted to update . I am blown away by Dr. Livingston once again. I knew my birth control was about to expire I needed to get it refilled but I have new insurance. They show Dr. Livingston on the plan at her other office yet when I call they said they do not take it. I was disappointed but I figured I would need to get a new Dr , surely Dr. Livingston would need to see me to renew. Out of the blue the other day I received a call from Dr. Livingston and she said she wanted to call in my refill but needed my new insurance information. I returned her call and she called me back personally and I explained my situation to her. She was kind enough to call in a year worth of refills so I do not stray off my pills and now I can see if she is on my plan when annual enrollment happens in Nov. Her bedside manner is off the charts. Please if you need a good OBGYN she is the woman to see.

First off I will say that out guide was very informative , and the place is lovely. We went on a 3 hour tour of the sanctuary and he explained everything in detail. However, when I emailed them to ask if they had hands on encounters I was advised by Christy that the tour is very interactive. I was looking forward to holding some of the safer reptiles.  I waited patiently and once the tour was over , all we got to do was feed the tortoises and pet a monitor lizard. No snake holding , nothing like the pictures you see on Yelp.  Maybe they did not have one to be held, but the main purpose I went was to hold and interact with the reptiles. It was quite the let down.

I joined this gym so I could work out after I had surgery and I am slowly trying to gain my strength back in my legs after being wheelchair bound for 6 months. The gym is pretty new and I like the fact I can work out and no one is bugging me to sign up for all the extra training sessions and such. The only negative I would say is my first time there was not very welcoming, no tour of the facility or anything so I am not sure really how to work much of the equipment. Nothing was explained such as the massage tables and massage chairs I had to ask how they worked. Overall worth the 19.99 a month and if it helps me in the end, its a great deal.

Excellent ! I took my Bingo here today and Tina is wonderful he came out super cute. What I really like is she is personable and it's not huge and store like Petsmart. Each dog gets special attention. I will be back again.

OMG! This place is amazing. The best chicken fingers I have ever had.  Their prices are very reasonable and they give you a lot of food for your money. The restaurant is very clean, the people are friendly and the only problem I can see , is you are going to want to go there everyday!  Another tip, their sweet tea is very good !

I had Skinny Wimps move me on Sept 17,2015. My movers were Jahan, Cameron, and Luis. They were awesome. My scheduled move time was between 1-6 pm. They called me at 12:45 and said they were on their way. When they got their they introduced themselves and got right to work. They were very professional and fast . I was moving from Tempe to Peoria and even with the bad traffic on I-10 they managed to get me moved in 3-3.5 hours. Everything was wrapped with blankets and plastic wrap and nothing was damaged. They were so friendly and even when one of the guys hurt his ankle he kept on pushing, I felt so bad for him but he did it with a smile. Every word out of them was please, thank you and May I? If I ever have to move again ( and I really hope I don't !) I will be using Skinny Wimp and I want these 3 guys again. They made a stressful situation so easy and fun!
