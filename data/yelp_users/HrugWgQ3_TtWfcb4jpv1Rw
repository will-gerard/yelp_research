I go to Check for all my pool needs. The reviewers that don't like their level of customer service are cry babies! Checker is a bunch of "dudes" that probably don't care if you want good customer service lol. So what if they eat their lunch at the counter, THEY ARE WORKING RIGHT?? They have helped me fix my barracuda, replace gadgets, totally rebuild and replace my back wash valve, rebuild a pump housing and they are always helpful and pleasant when I go in.

Dr Jacquie is a fantastic vet! She practices acupuncture, and has been treating my dog since summer 2011 for hip issues. She is conservative in her approach, and does not recommend unnecessary procedures or medications. Dr. Jacquie also answers emails when you have questions or concerns. I highly recommend her to anyone that wants to use holistic medicine to treat their pets.  The staff is also great, and very friendly.

Elitist Detail is more like it. If you want to give money to someone who judges you by the car you drive, this is your man. I bought a detail from living social and the customer service was pitiful to non existent from the beginning.   On the scheduled morning of my detail, he called me around 8:30 am to ask if he could come "way" earlier than scheduled. I replied sure, just give me a call to let me know when you are on your way. I never received a call back, and he showed up an hour before the original scheduled time. Not my idea of "way" earlier.  When he arrived with his assistant, I showed him my back seat and said that I understand if they cannot vacuum up all the dog hair (my car has woven cloth seats, not ideal for a short haired dog, but I didn't know I would be rescuing a dog when I bought my car) His reply was, " Well, I don't know what you are expecting for a coupon." Really??? I'm expecting the same quality of service that you would give to anyone, regardless of whither they purchased a "coupon" or not!!!  While he and his assistant were working on my car, they were overly boisterous and so loud I could hear their conversations inside of my house.....just slightly annoying.  When they had finished working on my car, I asked Mr. Jensen how much he charges for a monthly detail, minus the engine cleaning. His response was, "It would be more financially feasible for you to just go to a car wash." What??? I just drop $100 (including a tip for the jerk)  for a half priced full detail. I chose to try mobile detailing because of the pathetic job car washes do, and the time and expense of waiting for or dropping off my car. But apparently Mr. Jensen is too good to detail my car. He quoted me $60 for a monthly detail, which is less than I've been paying at a local car wash for a crappy monthly detail.  This man is so judgmental and arrogant. Why is he offering coupons on living social if he is not looking for new customers of all income brackets?
