The only thing saving this from being a 1 star review is that they filled my request to move to a lower room, even if it was the 2nd day of our stay.   We got there late on night one and were given a room on the 4th floor with two twin beds. I called and told them I had booked a king bed and they said "Well, you didn't, but we can move you". So they moved us to another 4th floor room that reeked of smoke and just felt old/dingy. The Internet did not work at all on the 4th floor, either. We ended up crashing on a friend's couch that night.   The next day, they moved us down to a ground floor room and the breakfast selection was decent. The new room felt, and looked, much cleaner. Also, the Internet worked. Although, the A/C wasn't great, and even though it was set at 72, we woke up sweating and had to turn it down to almost 60. The employees were polite, but many of the other guests in the lobby were incredibly rude - cutting in line, interrupting, ect.   And there was ZERO parking. We parked in the side lot for the ballrooms each night. Even though they kept telling us (and other guests) that more parking would be available. Overall, I was not impressed and would never stay here again.

Some amazing bands comes to the Marquee, don't get me wrong, but the venue itself is another story. The tickets are WAY overpriced. Upon first glance, they seem affordable, but then there are almost $10 in fees...per ticket. And they're will call only.   The remodeling is nice, much more open, but this place over serves to the extreme. If someone comes up stumbling drunk and asks for a couple more beers, they get then without question. The last two times I've been there, people have been carried out on stretchers covered in vomit. That's not counting the surrounding people that were by some chance still standing.   But yet they made me throw out my gum at the door. Right.

This place does not look like much from the outside, let's be honest. Or from the inside, for that matter. In fact, if I didn't go there with someone that knew it was vegan, I wouldn't have been able to figure it out at first glance.....BUT, that being said...THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!   The ladies working were genuine and funny. The cupcakes were so reasonably priced (i.e. amazingly cheap for vegan goods) that I ordered two and a "poptart". The french toast cupcake was just the right amount of sweet and had a distinct flavor. It didn't just taste like any other cupcake. My husband had the carrot cupcake a few hours later and loved the "cream cheese" frosting and walnuts. The portrait is still sitting in my fridge, but seriously, go here.   It's amazing.

I hadn't been here in years and it's changed so much! And for the better. The coffee is reasonably priced, which means it's cheaper than Starbucks (and has higher quality beans), and the vibe is really laid back. If you're sick of going into super snobby coffee shops - go here!   I ordered an iced latte with almond milk. Unfortunately, the almond milk started to separate. It's fine to drink, but pretty unappealing. I asked if they would remake it with soy milk and they did it without question. There is plenty of seating indoor and outdoor and I will definitely be back the next time I'm in town. I can see why this place is my friend's favorite!

Ahhh - I'm almost glad I don't live in Phoenix because I would be so fat. I got the Tsm'ores with vanilla "ice cream" yesterday and it was amazing. It's so cool to have an all vegan place like this - I was so excited when my friend told me about it.

As if the Tsoynami's weren't good enough, I tried brunch here for the first time this weekend and it was soooo good. I got the Benedict as a plate - tofu scramble, asparagus, tempeh bacon and hollandaise served over chibatta bread. I also got the Cactus Haboob Latte - agave and cinnamon infused and it was to die for. Vegan or not, go to this place!   It fills up quick though, so get there early or expect a little wait!

I've been to the other Green location in Tempe many times (which is always great) - and I tried this one for the first time yesterday. Seems like it's in a great location and it definitely stands out. The service was friendly and quick and the food was fresh, hot, and delicious. I would recommend their veggie burgers to anyone - they are made there and are unlike any I have had. Love this place!

Came here today for lunch when visiting from Tucson and it was great! Unlike most vegan/vegetarian restaurants, this one really has a diner style. The menu is limited, the dining room is small, but it's in a funky location with a unique feel. I had the "ELT" which was eggplant "bacon" with lettuce and tomato on toasted sourdough - the eggplant wasn't crispy, but it was smokey and delicious.   Overall, I thought it was a nice turn off the beaten path of super trendy vegan restaurants.

I was looking for a healthy place to eat with vegan options while attending an event at the Phoenix Convention Center. Despite the heat, the walk wasn't far. I created my own bowl and felt like I was given enough choices and didn't need to add more (most places limit you to two or three add-ins, it was five on top of your rice and protein here). Each bowl was $10 and the portioned appeared to be small, but I was full before I even finished mine. Very fresh ingredients, as well. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a healthy option in this area!
