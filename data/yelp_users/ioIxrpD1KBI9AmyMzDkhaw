Not very happy, overall quality of service was mediocre. I haven't had a pedicure in months. Today was the day I chose to treat myself and splurge the money. Front desk receptionist charged the wrong amount to my card. When I asked him to please not run the card twice, he didn't listen and now I have two charges to my account. He apologized but didn't offer any resolution nor copies of my receipt. I now need to take it up with my bank.

I am a firm believer in the physical and emotional benefit from massage. Being in the beauty industry it is my job to be providing not only great customer service but to develop lasting relationships with our clientele. Nicole was my massage therapist she not only did an amazing job and listened  to my concerns, she also gave me some at home advice to combat some of my aches and pains. I felt really comfortable with her and will be seeing her again very soon!

Favorite sushi restaurant by far! Fresh and creative rolls. Great customer service. My family, boyfriend and I have been coming here for years. We love our local sushi spot.

Love this place! Fantastic customer service. Amazing food and ambiance. Mamamangos are delicious. For chocolate lovers you must try the Nutella crepes, I add strawberries! The perfect place for a Sunday brunch.

Best pizza around!! The coal brick oven makes the crust perfectly toasted not burnt! Best flavors, variety of the freshest toppings.  huge selection of wine and beers on tap. My favorite white wine Equilibrium. The best seasonal cheesecake, we all have a secret love hate relationship with Girl Scout cookies so you must try the Samoa cookie cheesecake. My favorite Friday night spot, or occasional Wednesday night at the bar after work no matter that time of day in the week they always treat me like I'm VIP. Shout outs to my favorite people. Ken is an amazing manager. I watch him go around to all the tables and making sure everyone is enjoying their meals, if you can remember my name let alone my go to meal that's impressive! Grimaldis has such a great atmosphere all the employees have such fun attitudes and are really knowledgeable about the menu. Nick usually works behind the bar but does a little of everything he has been with Grimaldis for years but he is the single hardest working guy in the biz! Love getting to come in and chat it up with him. Danny and John are my go to boys. If I don't get to sit in their section I'll wait!! Thank you for such an enjoyable meal!!
