The PHX Zoo is amazing! Always clean, friendly employees, great exhibits. I've been during the day & in the evening for Zoo Lights as well. One of the best zoos I have ever been to. If you have little ones & are looking for something to do, this is the place. If you get their membership, the perks are awesome & so worth it. They do free giveaways on Facebook for some of their special events like Prowl & Play.

So much fun! Our friends took us here for a quick afternoon activity while we were waiting for my husband's motorcycle to get serviced. This place has 4 different mini golf courses which are very Happy Gilmore in design. They also have a huge arcade, water bumper boats & an actual roller coaster! It does seem to be a popular place for all ages, so if you're looking for something kid free on the weekends, this isn't the place for you. We are excited to head here for a date night again soon!

Where do I begin? My recent stay at the Bellagio was phenomenal! My fiancé and I were so excited to be in Vegas for the first time, and to be staying at the Bellagio was like the cherry on top. When you first walk in, you immediately see the breathtaking glass ceiling full of colors. Our room was on the 30th floor with an unbelievable view of the Fountains. We walked in just as they were starting to go off the first night we arrived. Throughout our trip, we were well taken care of and housekeeping always stopped in once or twice a day to refill anything we were missing or to fluff our pillows again. My fiancé had met 2 of the Executive Hosts through his work back in Chicago and they were also very attentive in making sure we were enjoying ourselves during our stay. The hotel is packed full of restaurants and shops, so there's almost no reason to leave (except to explore the rest of the strip)! The Botanical Garden was just set up for fall and it was really neat to walk through and see the pumpkins made of mums and the talking tree. I could go on and on and on about how amazing the trip was, but it's something you have to see for yourself. My fiancé and I are excited to go back again and we will be returning to the Bellagio for many trips to come.

Absolutely delicious! And the portions are big enough for 2 people! My fiancé and I visited the Peppermill on our trip to Las Vegas via a recommendation from one of my good friends. It was not on the strip, so I was a little unsure about heading there at first, but it is more than worth it. We were there for breakfast and the omelets were huge! The menu is pretty extensive, mostly basic dinner food, but something for everyone. I am a lover of breakfast to begin with, but I was over the moon about this place. Did I mention their sugar is colored? At first glance, it almost looks like glitter! LOVE! The service was quick and everyone was friendly. The waitresses wear uniforms that go along with the ambiance of the place: Vegas meets townie dinner meets flamingos...very neat little place that I would have never found if it weren't for a friend who visits her family. I will definitely be returning for another breakfast or two on our next trip to Vegas! Go and get an omelet, you won't be disappointed!

AMAZING! I am not the biggest fan of Mexican food, so when we decided to try this place for lunch I was kind of expecting the same greased up, fried, typical Mexican food. Boy, was I wrong! The ambiance is so perfect...with their swans & turtles swimming in the pond. The outdoor would be a beautiful venue for a rehearsal dinner or any fun get together. Decorated festive but not overdone. The salsas they bring out before your meal are tasty: mild/medium was my favorite. Husband loved the spicy & the tomatillo was  also good. We were told the portions are huge, so husband & I split the pollo fundido which came with beans and rice. Delicious! I had the most perfect prickly pear margarita. Overall terrific experience!

Longest lasting pedicure ever! I went almost month with this pedicure before it started to chip. The techs there are very quick. My sister-in-law did have a problem with the hot stones being too hot but she is a regular here & always raves about how great her pedis are. I will definitely be returning!

We love AZ Animal Wellness! All of the docs and techs here are amazing! They remember your pet & you, which is nice to not have to repeat your story time and time again. Every time we have taken our pup in, they always treat him with kindness & sensitivity. I wouldn't trust any other vet. If anyone is looking for a vet who will give great care & treatment options, look no further. They also have a great wellness program for your animal, which helps cut down some yearly costs.

Absolutely love this place! Husband and I have eaten here a few times now. Great happy hour, great sushi, great appetizers. I would highly recommend getting there early as it gets pretty busy & the dining room is on the smaller side. We got 5 rolls, an app, beers all for $50. Will definitely be heading back here soon!

Husband & I stopped here for lunch after meeting about season tickets for the AZ Coyotes. Hubs had the Reuben which only had meat on 1 side of the sandwich. I had a chicken Caesar wrap that was below average taste. I'm not sure if it was because of the off season of sports or what but we were not impressed & will probably not go back. Even the draft beer & water tasted like the tubes hadn't been cleaned in a while.

There are pros and cons about this bridal shop, so I will separate them in that respect.  Pros: Large selection of dresses Beautiful accessories Accommodating when making appointments  Cons: Multiple sales associates crowded around front desk when you 1st walk in Self presentation (gum chewing, very relaxed style of dressing) So-so knowledge/ability to communicate details & design of dresses & their designers Lack of  interest in the bride they are selling to  Now, in their defense, I did come on a rather busy Sunday and they had back to back appointments. But when I walk into a bridal salon, I want to feel like I have my sales associate's undivided attention. I want her to make me feel like a bride, which I don't think is asking too much! I'm sure all of the women who work there are lovely, but their lack of interest in my needs and who I am as a bride really turned me off, not to mention a lower self presentation standard.   I think bridal shopping is a hot & cold kind of thing & I came away from this appointment pretty chilly.

I am in love with Epic Salon & Becca Better! When I moved here from Chicago 2 years ago, I thought I would never find someone who could live up to what I was used to. I am so happy with the service, products & professionalism at Epic. I have been telling everyone I know that this is THE place to go if you want your hair done right! Becca is very understanding of what I want & helps me with her knowledge & skill to make it all become a reality. She really knows what she's doing & she is so sweet & funny! I normally put off getting a haircut until I really need it, but I will be coming back to see Becca at Epic sooner rather than later!

Amazing experience! My husband & I worked with Jeff in sales who was able to find the best fit for what I wanted/needed in a new car. He was honest & helpful, both of which I highly value. Jeff spent a good chunk of the day with us answering questions, test driving & making sure we were comfortable during the whole process. I LOVE my 2015 328i!!! My husband ended up getting a BMW motorcycle they had in the showroom & he is just as pleased.  Went in for my armor to be installed & have them fix a little tint issue on my driver window about a week later & Matt in service was just as awesome. Easy drop off & pick up the next day. Would recommend Chapman BMW to everyone!

I love breakfast, but hate pancakes. Snooze has now changed my mind on pancakes because they're freaking amazing!! Sweet potato pancake & the cinnamon roll one are to die for! The portions are huge, which is nice to leave breakfast/brunch without already thinking of lunch. A new location just opened in Gilbert & I will be frequenting that location to get my fill of all these delicious breakfast offerings.

Loved the tacos here! Husband & I have been wanting to try this place for a while. Went out for dinner with our friends & we will all be coming back soon. Margaritas we're delicious! Salsa that comes out with the chips is pretty spicy. My husband was impressed by the selection of craft beers available since he was expecting domestic drafts & corona. My only minor issue was sitting out on the patio and not being able to read the menu because the lighting isn't that great. I would love to see some cute and festive patio lights strung across the patio!

Went out for dinner with the hubby & our friends. We've been hearing about AZ Wilderness Brewing Co for a long time, but the first 2 times we went it was over 2 hrs for a table...this time we got lucky! I started off the night with their IPA, which was delicious. Once we were seated, our table ordered the pretzels sticks & cheese. The pretzels sticks themselves were cooked to perfection-crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. The cheese, however, was extremely salty and was not a good match for the pretzels. For dinner, I ordered the Hawaiian wilderness burger, but subbed pulled pork instead. When the dinner came, I swear I thought mine was salad..not a very good presentation of burger & my side salad. I had ordered raspberry vinaigrette but they brought me the beer vinaigrette instead, which was a blessing because the raspberry vinaigrette was just a cold pinkish substance with no taste. The pork was yummy, but I didn't love the sauce or the fact that I couldn't bite into the pineapple on my sandwich because it was so hard. Overall, no one in our group was too impressed with the food. The beer is a do again, but nothing else.  Side note for the gluten free people out there: there is no other alcohol option besides beer. Our friend was super disappointed she couldn't get anything to drink because they didn't have a full bar

My husband & I moved here from the Chicagoland area & we have been on the hunt for good Chicago pizza that we don't have to fly in from Chicago! Buddyz definitely is our place now! It is right up there with Lou's in my opinion. They also have a great selection of craft beer which my husband & I swoon over every time. If you get their Buddyz card and come back within 7 days you get 20% off which is also a great perk. We are thrilled to have our own little taste of home so close to us here in the Valley. Everyone who is from Chicago should hit this place up and see for yourself...I think you're going to love it!

Pretty cool boutique with lots of fun items! Was here during their grand opening in Old Town as they just relocated from downtown PHX. I think a bit more inventory will definitely do them good in the long run. They have a beauty bar now where you can get the complete vintage pin up girl look from head to toe! So fun!!

Everyone here is super friendly! We had some problems getting the title of our car transferred because of moving from out of state & changing to my married last name. They could not have made the transition easier for us! I will never go back to the regular motor vehicle service again. Third party MVS is the way to go!

Amazing! I stood in line for 40 mins to give this place a try & it was worth it! So many different options of cookies, ice creams & toppings. As a pregnant lady, this place is pure heaven. I can't wait to come back & I've been raving to all of my friends & family about the Baked Bear. Only small downside is the seating. There are way too many people coming in to be able to sit them all, so if you don't mind standing to eat your treat (like me) then this shouldn't be an issue. You can even get your ice cream sandwich on wheels & enjoy it in the company of your own home...unless you end up eating it in the car because temptation is just too much!
