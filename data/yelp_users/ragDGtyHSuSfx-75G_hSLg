We bought a home that has an existing roof warranty with Collum Roofing, I called over a week ago to request someone to come out and look at the leak in our roof. The receptionist who answered the phone told me - over the phone - that our leak wouldn't be covered under warranty. SIGHT UNSEEN. Even if this is true we still need someone to fix the leak and might have hired this company to fix the roof on our home and our rental property, but as every other yelp review for Collum has assured, no one will return our phone call. I don't understand how they are still in business.

Justin always does a thorough job and is very pleasant and trustworthy. No harsh chemicals and reasonably priced. They are the only place I call for carpet cleaning!

We visited this location for the first time and had an excellent experience on a Sunday night. The staff was friendly, knowledgeable and efficient. We were in and out in 30 minutes!  I would recommend to anyone with children or babies.

Atmopsphere is great, food is Delish and they were super accommodating for my son's egg allergy. Family friendly or great for a night out with adults!
