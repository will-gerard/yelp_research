The best Mexican food in the Phoenix area. It is a total hole in the wall place. Don't let that scare you off!  Their margaritas are wonderful, rice and beans are awesome, and their chicken enchiladas suizas rock! I alternate between that and their pork "special." 1 star knocked off for slow service.

The perfect afternoon at Tonto is 2 prickly pear margaritas, the Three Sisters Salsa with a side of guac, and dessert. Their desserts are often-changing (sometimes, just made for that day) and awesome! We are usually the youngest people in the place. But, we are usually there on Friday afternoons or weeknights.  When there for dinner, I get a burger and sweet potato tots. The margaritas are good...not weak like some of the local places. I am pretty happy after two.   If you go on your birthday, tell them. You get this little box with a couple of handmade chocolates. TO DIE FOR! Also, follow them on facebook. They post pics of new dishes and dessserts a few times a week. Sometimes we change our plans based on these pics!

I'd almost give the place 5 stars even if the food was crap just b/c Alberto is so darn cute! My youngest (4) was insistent that she needed macaroni. Well, there wasn't a kid's menu. So, I told her we'd get pizza. When Alberto came to the table, she decided to ask him, "Do you have any macaroni?" He answered, "For you, yes!" She gave me the smuggest look ever. It seems like we had some of everything. The ravioli was super rich. But, really good. The margherita pizza was wonderful! We've gotten it "to go" a few times since b/c it's a lot better than Barro's. The only thing I didn't love was the cannoli.  In terms of atmosphere, it's more refined than the cowboy restaurants in Cave Creek. But, still casual and comfortable enough that we could bring the kids.

Dr Darren West is great. We've used him several times during the last 2 years. So, 5 stars for him!  However, my beef is with the office. Due to a conflicting schedule (new born baby appt), I could not take my daughter in for her visit. Since her Nana was taking her, I called the office to prepay my copay and update our insurance information. I sent the new card along with my mother. Somehow, the new insurance info did not get entered. So, they billed to the old insurance company. Six months later, I get a bill for $335. Naturally, they cannot bill to the current insurance company b/c of the time limitations. I've talked to everyone and no one can seem to do anything about it.   Everyone has an "off" day, I get it. But, someone's "off" day shouldn't cost me $335. So, sadly, I cannot recommend Phoenix Dermatology. Maybe try their Scottsdale location?

My beef is with billing. We moved from SoCal (SoCal Gas) where our last year bill for this month was $58. I compared useage and we are almost exactly the same. SW Gas charges $109. Since their rates are higher, taxes are higher. Also, their standard fees are double what our old ones were. To add insult to injury, there is a $9.84 EEP weather adj charge. I called to find out what that is..."since winter has been warmer and you are using less gas than predicted, we charge that fee." Really?!? I have to pay a fee for NOT using as much over-priced gas.   I am interested in seeing if rates go down now that the oil/gas market is tanking. Doubt it, but we'll see.

After months of saying "we should try that place one day" as we walk into Carefree Station, we finally gave it a try! Because it was 3:30 in the afternoon on a Thursday (when a lot of other places are closed between meals or offering only the "bar menu"), we were the only ones there. Service was great. The waiter (owner?) even turned on the tv over the bar and put on cartoons for the kids.   We had the Saganaki for starters. It was a bit too much of a "stinky cheese" kinda cheese for me (I stick to mozzerella, goat cheese, and feta). But, the cheese lovers at our table were practically licking the pan. We all shared the Feta Cheese Salad. The pita pockets that you got to stuff were a hit. I could just eat the stuff with a spoon. I had the chicken gyro. It was FULL of well seasoned chicken. With yogurt sauce dripping down my hands, I ate, shared, and ate some more. Hubby had the World Famous Gyro and said it's the most authentic flavored gyro he'd had in years (since DC).   The kids just had "kid food" when they weren't eating ours. My picky one who only eats fries and chips at restaurants (and, who often won't even eat the fries...yes, she's THAT picky) gave the fries her stamp of approval.   I didn't think it was too pricey...especially if you're just getting a gyro for lunch. In Cave Creek/Carefree where you often pay $12+ for a burger, an $8 gyro with a TON of meat isn't bad!

Since we have 3 daughters, my hubby was dying to know the sex of our unborn (at 15 wks). So, we all went down to Prenatal Peek today.  I scheduled the Quick Peek online. I received a reminder email the day before and a verification phone call the afternoon before. I knew to ask about parking when they called (thanks to other reviews!). Drive between the two little cream colored houses (one is an insurance business) and park in the rear. The front waiting room was nice enough. Not overly fancy...but, better than the kinda "sketchy" feeling of the exterior. The room where you actually get your ultrasound is very comfortable!   The people here are amazing. Due to a completely uncooperative baby, our 15 min session turned into 45 min. No one was scheduled immediately after me....so, they kept at it until he opened up his legs. I had to get out of bed to drink, eat, and move around twice to get him to move. But, it worked. They are amazingly patient and were genuinely excited to find out it's a boy (probably b/c they felt sorry for my husband who is completely out-numbered).   This being our 4th, I could have waited until my dr's ultrasound in 2 1/2 weeks. But, I'm glad we went.

We have only been seen for healthy visits. But, I am completely happy with Dr Potts. I vaccinate on an alternative schedule and she didn't give me any lectures. Thank you! The waiting room is boring. Although, they will be opening the new office soon, betting it will be an improvement.

We have been twice in the last couple of months, different kids, different issues. The staff was friendly and responded to our issues accordingly. When I brought in a child with low O2 levels, all the examination rooms were full. But, the dr saw us immediately after finding out. Diagnosis was spot on.   We also have had xrays done to make sure a toddler sized pinky wasn't broken. The waiting room is a bit drab, the crowd is mixed, and you'll see people in their pajamas. But, it is worth the 25min drive, passing urgent cares in the way, to see a pediatrician.

The southwest fried chicken is THE BEST. I could eat it every day, all day long. Seriously, the poblano mashed potatoes and street corn...yum! I don't drink beer. But, their margaritas are great. We usually get the dip sampler and add pork. Their pork is good, making my second favorite meal their street tacos.   Sit inside or out. Their walls are open this time of year, giving fresh air (and occasional flies).

Admittedly, I'm not a huge meat eater. At Brazilian Steakhouses, I gorge on the cheesy bread things, mashed potatoes and plantains (and, in Vegas, a pitcher of sangria). This the only Fogo de Chao location I've visited. I'm thrilled that they are open for lunch. I sometimes meet my hubby there (now, he IS a carnivore and makes up for me not eating much meat). It's not crowded, service and food selection are still great, and it's cheaper. Also, kids 5 and under are free. Unfortunately for them, my four year old eats everything. She's in heaven here.  I still think I prefer Texas de Brazil b/c their plantains and potatoes are better. But, Fogo de Chao has palenta. The salad bar area and meats are about equal.   I did notice that the meats are cooked more than some of the other Brazilian steakhouses. More medium-well. The bacon-wrapped filet was great!

I yelped ahead of time and got some good tips. Since we were bringing the kids with us to Vegas (I know, I know...but my grandmother was going to be in town & we haven't seen her in over a year), we needed a kid-friendly hotel (i.e. space and a fridge).  I ordered groceries from Von's that literally arrived when we did. I didn't want to have to mess with dishes being delivered. So, I just included plastic/paper bowls, cups, spoons, towels, etc with the groceries.  They held our groceries in their cooler until we got up to our room & then brought them right up. When checking in, they scheduled our linen delivery for the sofa bed. The sofa bed was NOT comfy. Glad the kids slept in it and not me!  On day 2, the cleaning lady did a crappy job. Didn't leave washclothes, didn't pull the trash, didn't leave coffee, etc. The other days were fine.   We didn't have any time issues with valet...even the time we left our ticket in the room. Tipping got a bit annoying (especially since we were getting the car out 2 times a day).   We had a beautiful view of Bellagio's fountains! I didn't realize we could walk to Bellagio through the doors at the far end (around the corner) of the lobby until the last night.   The Bosch washer and dryer were a lifesaver! Though small, they got the job done. Just watch the dryer b/c it'll think your load is dry when it isn't.   We got a good "name your own price" deal on priceline & upgraded to the full-sized refrigerator room once we got there (for an extra $40 a night).   I'd stay there again, especially if we have kids in tow.

We stopped in yesterday (Memorial Weekend Sunday) for drinks. We had family in town and decided to show them around Cave Creek. We'd eaten a huge breakfast at Harold's a couple of hours before...so, we weren't looking for food, just drinks and an order of chicken tenders for the kids.  Business was slow. When we got there, two tables were seated and there was one guy at the bar. Our waitress arrived about 5 minutes later to take our drink order (1 iced tea, 2 waters, 1 lemonade, 1 milk, 1 corona and 1 prickly pear margarita...boring, I know...but there were 3 kids, a baby, and a pregnant woman in the party). After 15-20 minutes of waiting, we flagged down another waiter. While, he was taking our order, our original waitress arrived with drinks. So, we placed the chicken tenders order and waited AGAIN. More waiting for the bill to arrive. Once my husband gave her the credit card, I brought the kids outside.  After another 20 minutes, the other adults met me. My husbad was still in there waiting to get his credit card returned. The manager (who was also waiting tables) stopped by to ask if he needed anything. He told her what was happening and said she'd get the owner.  As it turns out, our waitress was also the bar tender. We were the unlucky ones to get the one table that the bar tender is assigned to serve (it was not even in the same room as the bar!). So, they'll be changing that policy.  Did they comp anything? NO   Not that we were looking for free stuff. But, a confused manager, apologetic owner, and waitress with 100 excuses after an hour and a half ordeal doesn't sit well with me. The manager did say,  "I hope you didn't tip her!"    With all of the touristy, cowboy restaurants in Cave Creek, I'll pass on the Smokehouse. As newer residents to Cave Creek, we've eaten there once before and the food was not memorable. The main attraction is the location. Oh, and the kids like the piano & dummy in the front room.

Stage Coach Village can look pretty empty sometimes. But, don't pass on this one! I had the crepe with chicken and pesto. Since I've only had dessert crepes, I didn't know what to expect. But, I took the chance (I LOVE pesto) and am glad I did. It was SO good. Hubby had one with ham that he said he'd order again. The kids had nutella and strawberry ones. Everyone was happy. Without realizing it, we got there just before closing. But, we weren't rushed at all. Sitting outdoors was cozy. And, there's good music playing, too.

Admittedly, I've never had the pizza here. But, we've been 3 or 4 times and really enjoy is. I usually get the strawberry/goat cheese/grilled chicken salad (sometimes they have raspberry, it's great, too!). I don't even use the dressing (which comes on the side) b/c the reduced balsamic on the chicken is enough to flavor the salad. My husband and kids love the mussels. Sometimes we get a cheese pizza for the kids that goes half eaten (probably b/c they've gorged on mussels and garlic bread sticks).  The lamb and risotto were surprisingly good. We always sit outside. Oh, and I always love the music (I'm a sucker for Ella and Sinatra).

I come here WAY too often. With amazing staples and fun, changing flavors, who could stay away? My phone thinks I work here. It keeps telling me, "15 minutes to work."  They are really patient about people sampling flavors. While you can only get one flavor in the small cup, you can get 2 (1/2 and 1/2) in the medium.  The displays are beautiful! It looks as good as it tastes. And, the restrooms are nice and clean.

This is one of my new fav places to eat. I'm addicted to the brisket and fries. I haven't had brisket this good since "back home" in Louisiana. While they do have homemade sauces, you don't need it! I'm not big on bbq sauce...so, I look for brisket that has enough of its own flavor to stand alone. And, the fries are so, so good. The pulled pork is really good, too.  For those of you who know Bryan's in Cave Creek, this place is better! I really want to try breakfast one day.

We've used Daydreams (formerly, Maui Playcare) for a couple of years. It's great for quick appts when I don't want to bring the kids. They literally charge to the minute. So, you aren't rounding up like you might with your sitter. My kids always have a great time. It can get pricey if all 3 are there for the 4 hr max (and I give them permission to buy snacks). But, they often send coupons (get on their email list) and you can bring in your own food.  We've had periods when we haven't gone for 5 or 6 months and they know my kids by name when we walk in. Impressive!

These guys are easy to book, very affordable, and do great work. I had him clean all of our floor tile, approx 420sq ft. It's worth the time saved scrubbing!
