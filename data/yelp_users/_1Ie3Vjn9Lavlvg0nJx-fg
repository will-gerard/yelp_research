This was one of those days where I was out and a bout and decided to stop in and see what this place was all about.  I have been following them on instagram for months.  Today they were featuring their version of the blt.  Some how they figured out how to transform the classic sandwich into the best blt I've ever ate.  The bread and bacon where the stars of this one with the garlic spread and heirloom tomatoes as the co-stars. This place is a winner!  Food Guy Out!

Great change from the unhealthy lunches I was use to in the Pacific NW.  I tried the tofu Thai peanut rice bowl and the poblano humus.  Both were seasoned perfect with great flavor's.  Plenty of veggies and I didn't leave hungry!  I will be back more often than not!    Food Guy Out!

This place started following me on Instagram so I decided to stop in for lunch and check them out.  I grabbed a seat at the bar where I was greeted with a smile and hello. There isn't a bad seat in the place. If ambiance is what you seek this place has it. The menu has something for everyone. I started with the deviled eggs which were piled high and topped with bacon.  They were full of flavor and seasoned perfectly.  Next were the short rib tacos.  They come deconstructed with house made to order corn tortillas, guacamole, pico, and an amazing kale and grape salad. The short ribs were tender, tortillas amazing.  This plate probably could be split and serve two but I managed to take down the entire plate of food.  I will definitely go back!

This company is extremely below average.  Unless you're the first or second flight of the day don't bother.  This company is notoriously late. If they tell you that you are going to be late plan on an extra 30-45 minutes.  Fuck this airline!

Very, very over rated!  The only thing that stands out is the service.  If you are the person that raves about a market sandwich from Pane Bianco this is not for you.  Very simple and very average ingredients. My mom has been making sandwiches like this for me my entire life. I think I was expecting similar flair like the sandwiches from Culinary Dropout.   Food Guy Out!

This place is not over the top, but if you happen to be hungry and in the neighborhood head over to this place for some tasty tacos!  Everything is flavorful. Not the best I've had in the valley though.   Food Guy Out!
