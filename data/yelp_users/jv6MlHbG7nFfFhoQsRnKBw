This place was so great! My friend and I wanted to treat ourselves to a nice dinner and this ended up being the perfect place! We got a discount for checking in, and the food and service was amazing. Definitely recommend the mussle appetizer and clam pasta!

I order here quite often, the food is good and cheap and the delivery is always on time or earlier! I love the egg drop soup, and crab puffs. The delivery guy forgot my side of rice and they gave me a small soup instead of a large, but when I called they appoloized and 15 min later dropped off my missing items, no problem. Definitely a great place for when you don't have time to cook and want something hassle free!

Absolutely awful. $5 for fried mushrooms and there were only 6. Kids mac n cheese was just plain noodles, buffalo chicken sandwich was inedible with soggy bread and chicken so hard you can't even chew it. Called to get my money back or get new food and they tell me the cook is on break for an hour and they'll get back to me after that. Absolute joke of a restaurant.
