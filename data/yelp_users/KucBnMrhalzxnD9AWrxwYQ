We are Zoo members... the Phx zoo may not be the largest or most diverse but they do a nice job.   Zoolights was good but the center piece with the dancing lights was is a bad spot as they did not allow people to be across the water with a centered and unobstructed view - they blocked it off and the other angles had tons of trees blocking the view so much of the show could not be seen.   Poor form Zoo officials... guess no one was smart enough to check if people could actually view it properly. You just wasted a bunch of time doing something very cool that people could not really get the impact of.

In general Sky Harbor is lacking in almost every way.  It must be the most profitable major airport in the US because you can tell they don't spend any money making it a nice place.  This review has sections: Food, Terminal spaces quality, Security  Food... Sky Harbor really needs to step up the game making each terminal section have equal choice/quality of food. I'm not saying they all need 5 star places, just make them equal. This is a busy airport - get some decent places. Airports like Seattle, Denver, etc put Phoenix to shame  One gate area has only crappy hot dogs or burger king (barf king). I refuse to buy that swill.  Terminals... As Jasen F pointed out, the terminals are a dump. The ONLY exception is the Southwest spot in Terminal 4 which as been completely redone. Bravo to them... it is the only decent place in Sky Harbor.  Security... The one smart/good thing they did was put security at each terminal so there are more lanes overall and less bottlenecks. The bad thing is they use body scanners so this slows it down a ton... makes things 3 to 5 times longer per person.

Totally overrated... the subs are nothing special with flavor or quality. Yes, better than subway but there are WAY better sandwich places - Quiznos is better and I don't go there either unless someone else insists.  There are at least 5 better places, not even considering grocery stores have better quality and selection!

I've been going here many years.  The food is always very, very good. Soups are fantastic, sandwiches are hearty and flavorful, and the service is excellent. Prices are reasonable and the food quality and quantity is probably the best bang for the $ you'll get in a place like this, anywhere I've been - and I travel a lot.  I really cannot think of a single thing I can fault this place for.

Average quality, barely, and lacking in taste and originality. The chains, which I'm no fan of, beat this place easily.   There were a lot of families here... they must have cheap kids menu or something.

Everything about this place is just "OK"... nothing special, nothing creative.  It was unique many, many years ago when it opened but now it is the same old, tired menu. Go to Sprouts or Whole Foods and get the same things for 30% of the cost and it take 2 seconds to make at home - or - find a better restaurant that has similar food.

Had coffee there several times when an old friend used to study there daily... I thought the coffee was average at best.  You can get a decent milk-based coffee drink anywhere and they have no clue how to make espresso (almost one one does so this is no surprise).

I've been going here since the week it opened. The food is better than average, somewhere halfway between authentic Mexican and Americanized.  I love the salsa selections and the chips are good. The food is nothing spectacular but I will go here on occasion just to get decent Mexican food.  Try it, you might like it... many people do.

Breakfast here is some of the best... nothing crazy out-of-this-world different mind you, but good quality, good portions for a reasonable price. The coffee is good too, not weak like most places. They have a flavored coffee special everyday... some are good, some are so-so - plus it is the same cost as the regular coffee so never hurts to try it.  I rarely go out for breakfast but we go here when meeting friends and family.

This is a higher-middle quality chain... a little on the expensive side compared to others like Firebirds so I usually get the Classic Dinners as they are the best deal. I go here about 4-5 times a year.  The Prime Rib is always very good and the Chocolate Cake is great. The coffee is usually pretty bad... they really need to step up the quality of the coffee.

This is a high-end steakhouse and you pay for it. I never spend my own money here... too expensive - but I never pass up a chance to eat here on someone else's dime!  All the food is excellent... the one time my steak was bad they took it back no questions asked, gave me another and comp'd the entree.  The seafood tower, if you can afford it, is fantastic. The wine selection, as you'd expect, is very good.  Not much else to say as since if you know what a high-end steakhouse is supposed to be, this is it.

The Pumpkin Festival is always fun. Though I have no idea why they call it a Pumpkin and Chili Festival since they don't have anything chili related except they server some seriously average chili... they really need to cut that out of the title.  Anyway... this is a great place to take the kids in October... we go every year. Totally worth it.

Low-end "sports bar".  I did not see anything that would attract me there. It has been around for a long time so some people must like it. When I was there it was mostly guys getting off work wanting a beer... nothing fancy, not horrible, but not a place I'd stop at again.

Overall: 2.0 Ambiance: 4.5 Food Quality: 4.0 Food Quantity: 3.5 Value: 2.5  Conclusion - I may try again but this experience was such a let down I might spend my $ elsewhere instead.  What I tried:  Scallops -  2.0, NOT recommended! Cooked properly but the chorizo way 300% too overpowering on a dish that had all very light flavors. The executive chef should know better!!! I expected a 'hint' of chorizo, not half a sausage diced up and covering the risotto. Might have been a decent dish otherwise but who would know.   Cheese Plate - 3.5, recommended Nice cheeses and noshing items - grapes, olives, garlic, etc. Would have scored higher but they need to increase the additional items (especially olives/garlic) a lot as there was not enough to go around for the 6 of us on the largest plate they offer.   French Onion Soup - 2.5, so-so I've had much better. Maybe it was an off day or it was leftovers but it was bland and tasted like it was a few days old. I have had French Onion Soups from at least a hundred different establishments... It was not bad, but I'd not get again here.  Braised Lamb Shank - 4.0, excellent This was what I was was expecting from all the food. Well done in every way.  Poppy Seed & strawberry souffle - 1.0, no flavor at all very disappointing. I love poppy seed muffins and would have taken a muffin over this flavorless mash any day. The strawberry filling was lacking much flavor itself but what it did have 100% overpowered the nearly non-existent poppy seed flavor.

their 'thin crust' is not... it is hard cracker crust. NO Flavor.   The toppings and sauce were fine but the crust was bad... and I love good thin crust (chewy, very thin, italian style)

The food is OK but not anything to get excited about. I've tried it a few times over the past several years hoping it would impress me, it never does. There are other places I'd rather go that have more creative dishes, and more flavor. I'll eat there if others want to go but I don't go there otherwise.

I read a lot of great reviews so we tried it. I was not impressed.  This is definitely an older crowd (50+) and it seems they cater to that crowd. The food was small portions for the high cost, and the flavors were not all that great. The sweet breads were chopped up and drowned in sauce so you could barely taste the breads. I did not even think they were what we ordered.  I would not spend my money here, especially at their prices.

This is a dark, old, and really nothing special type of place - basically a dive that was clean.   In all, this is not my type of place. The patrons were all in the older crowd 60s+ and it did not seem like it was a place made for foodies.  The smoked ribs and chicken were pretty good and the creme brule was average.  Reminded me of a lower-end Don & Charlies.

I had no choice but to eat here... we were meeting friends. I will never eat here willingly again.  I paid $12 for a double burger (no extras), a drink, and fries. ... What a freakn' rip off.  The burger was OK. It was juicy and had some flavor it was only because they use very fatty meat and salt the hell out of it... yes, I can tell, I'm a very good cook. hey burgers are cooked well done - no surprise here for a low-quality burger joint.  I got the thick cut fries, thinking they'd be good... WRONG. Welcome to FatBurger where we serve fries that are exactly like you can get at the grocery store freezer section.  They sucked - period.  one word sums this place up... AVOID!

I'm a total foodie... see my reviews.  This place is pretty good IF you know how to deal with their HUGE PROBLEMS...  1) Prices are crazy for the quantity you get - make sure someone else pays 2) The Over Sauce EVERYTHING! Pear Salad was swimming in an ocean of dressing  Lamb Shank was good but the side dish was under the shank (Sweet potatoes in this case) and it was swimming in another ocean of sauce - you coul not taste anything bt the sauce.   ASK for ALL sauces on the side!

Had a corporate private dinner in the back room. There was a limited menu where most items were not on the normal menu. I the rack of lamb, a pumpkin soup, salad, and Tiramisu. The soup was so-so, salad was average and the Tiramisu was good but the portion was so small I'd barely call it a tasting. BUT the Rack of Lamb was PERFECT. The portion size was very good, it was cooked perfectly, and tasted above average. The service was good, to be expected since it was a corporate event. I'd go back.

There is no place like Antica Pizzeria da Michele, but you need to be in Naples Italy to eat there. Most pizza in Italy is really not great like they make you believe. It is almost as hard to find great pizza in Italy as it is in the USA. Bianco is good but not worth the 2+ hr wait much of the time. I think Patsy Grimaldi's Pizzeria is almost as good but less pricey (still not cheap) and no wait. If Bianco was closer to me in Chandler I'd go more often but Patsy Grimaldi's Pizzeria is a mile away and 90% as good.

If you go here get the full dinner entrees, they are fantastic. The smaller taco plates and such are decent but not why you want to go to Barrio.  You cannot go wrong with the Cochinita Pibil (12 hr pork) or my favorite, Pescado del Mar (halibut), or my wifes favorite, Chiles en Nogada (stuffed pablano pepper) - but everything is very good.  The place is small, and get packed later in the evenings. The service is very random based on the server you get. I've had great service many times, but horrible service just as many... and everything in between.  Go here... it is not cheap, but the food is worth it for those special occasions.

I keep going back here and forget to update.  This is hands-down one of my favorite places to eat. I even started eating guacamole - and I never liked it before.  I did read some of the other reviews that we less than 4 stars. All I can say is that many people are used to low-end Mexican food... rice and bean style. This is not that.  The mole is authentic, not the out of a can crap, and it tastes VERY different. It is somewhat of an love or hate thing... but trust me, for real mole, it is VERY good.  Looking forward to my next visit.

Really more like 3.5 stars... Here's why - All the food here is very good and very authentic and a good quantity for the price. The service has been bad 75% of the time I have been there/ The service and the bad decor is why it did not get a better rating.

I really think I need to try this place again... it was 1.5 stars, I felt no tingly feels as it seems others have.  The wine by the glass was over priced... we paid $20 for each large pour of good, but not great wine. And, our server had NO CLUE about the wines. A place like this should educate their servers.  brussel sprout salad (3/5) - dressing was seriously lacking flavor. would have been a 5/5 if the dressing was good.  prime rib (2/5) - large cut, very little flavor, except for the crust. the cut was too lean thus was not as tender or flavorful as it should have been ... we got two of these at the table, both were the same  desert (1/5) - pecan gelato was flavorless - red velvet cake was flavorless and/or had too little actual cake... 3x too much cream cheese filling.

This is a review for the Chef's Table Wine Tasting dinner with Clos du Val.  Bang for the Buck: 4/5 - the tasting dinner was nice and with the wine reasonably priced. I will go back.  Decor: 3/5 - a bit retro 70s, not my thing but done simply and it was fine  Ambiance: 3/5 - the room is open so not much privacy but the booth we were in gave a bit more than most spots  Service: 5/5 - they were great in all ways... very attentive, the wine flowed well; I had a bit too much :)  Food Quality: 5/5 - all was excellent her; top notch  Food Quantity: 4/5 - could have used a bit more on the plates... if I had not drank so much wine I would have still been hungry  Food Flavor: 5/5 - it is rare I give 5 here but this place deserves it on this meal. Everything was perfect!  Food Uniqueness & Creativity: 4.5/5 - very creative, perfectly paired flavors and in the right proportions.   Last Experience...  02/07/2011  Herb-Dusted Seared Ahi (braised tuscan kale, meyer lemon oil + pancetta) - amazing! honestly the best Ahi I've ever had. The herbs did not overpower but complimented  Warm Orange Braised Fennel (baby spinach, shaved red onion + parmesan croutons) - very good, could have used more fennel as that was a bit lacking in qty.  Flat Iron Steak and Duck Sausage (sweet pea tortellini + shiitake mushrooms) - perfect flavors, perfectly cooked. Would have liked to see one more slice of steak and more sausage... normally I'd have still been hungry  Chocolate Truffle Cake - this was the only item that was not great, it was so-so. flavors were average, and the cake part was a bit dry.

We used the Restaurant.com $25 off of $35 or more... and I still paid over $20 for 1 salad, 1 cup of miso, 3 rolls, 2 iced teas. The beverages were not included in the deal. 18% gratuity (for what?). For $6 more I could have gone to my regular place and got 5 big rolls with lots of fish in them, 2 large bowls of miso, 2 home made iced green teas, and a real sit-down service... I'd not go back to Cafe Wasabi, there was nothing compelling about this place - at all.  Food Quality: 2/5 barely average  Food Quantity: 2/5 below average - not much fish in the rolls, what I can easily call slivers of fish on top of rolls.  Food Flavor: 2/5 barely average, nothing great.  Food Selection: 2/5 below average, they had very few fish types and most rolls had the same stuff in it, just with different sauces. big woop. No nigiri, no handrolls - and they had regular sandwiches... really!?  Decor & Service : 2/5 below average, "Cafe" is a good way to describe this place's decor, style, and ordering method. I did not care for it at all.

I'm only rating the food... I got a ToGo order.   I love supporting local / family owned places but I must be honest with my reviews.  I would have given them 3 stars but the Lasagna was HORRIBLE. ... It was simply a pile of pasta sheets (like 7-8) with one 1" wide, half inch thick strip of sausage on one end and a small amount of cheese in 2 or three layers.  So either the chef has NO CLUE what Lasagna is - thus he/she needs to go a google search - or they were cheap azzez ripping off customers. If I was sitting in the place I would have sent it back without blinking.  Also ordered was Pasta Prinavera (pretty good) and a Stromboli which was good, worth ordering again.  In all I'd rally like to give this place another try but I feel cheated by the pile of pasta sheets they charged me for calling it Lasagna. So, I have not decided if I will give them another shot or not...

I cannot say enough good things about this place, just GO! Service is excellent, food is ALWAYS top notch. I've had nearly everything on the menu. I'm very picky with my food and all the dishes rates 'above average' up to 'stellar'!   Seafood soup is very good and the mushroom soup is one of the best I've ever had, period. The Insalata con Rucola  comes with the raspberry vinaigrette but I recommend the champagne dressing on any salad as it is amazing. My favorite "normal" dish is the Pollo alla Genovese.  Go and enjoy!

Overall: for a chain in this price range I like others better but Roy's does a pretty good job.  Food: quality is what you'd expect from a higher-end chain. Flavor varies greatly. Some dishes are great and others are no better than a fast food Chinese place nearest 'anywhere America' - yes really.  Service: Always very good, never a complaint here expect when they did nothing when my dish was crappy. Did not comp the dish or even offer a desert... no, I did not even finish it.  When to Go: business dinners are the only time I use this place. If I spend my on cash, I go other places and get better food for the same $.

I do mostly take out - and eat in rarely but I do 2-3 times a year and noticed... Totally hit or miss here when you do take out.  It seems that you get less food when you do take out - I have noticed you definitely get less veggies and less meat.  Never order 'extra' of anything - you have less than a 50% chance you will actually get anything worth the $1 or $2 you are paying.  I order extra veggies and get like 2 or 3 broccoli pieces.   I only get food here when there is a Bogo, that is the only time it is worth take out.

This is a higher-middle quality end chain food... almost on par with The Keg but not quite - also not as expensive as The Keg. I go here every so often.  One big turn off to me is this place tends to be very loud and it is difficult to have a relaxing dinner unless we get there early. The kitchen is open to the dining area and the dining area is basically one massive, high ceiling, room. Should have been designed better for a quieter, more relaxing experience in the dining area.

I think the pizza here is some of the best I've had, and I ate a lot of pizza in Italy too. Grimaldi's could use a small price adjustment. I would go there far more often if they were 15-20% lower on the price. They'd still be more expensive then the normal NYPD and such but it would be worth the cost... as it is right now, I eat there once every 6 months since it is expensive for pizza.   Picazzo's is of similar quality and price (except when you use Restaurant.com certificates it is a better price). Grimaldi's is closer so I go here more often.

If I wrote a full review you'd never read it... it would be too long. We had nearly everything on the darn menu.  Everything here is between excellent to amazing, except the deserts which are so-so - more on that later.  Be warned... this place is very expensive. I would not spend my own $ here... it is at least 30% too expensive IMO compared to other places I go of this caliber. But, if you want to drop $100/person (not including drinks) and want good food... try it.  Anything cooked gets 5 stars: lamb, black cod, and about everything else is great.   Sushi gets 3 stars: it is just OK - they do a few things that are good but nothing beyond 4 stars and that is pushing it. The fish selection is not very big so they need to step it up there is they really want to be a top place to go for just sushi.  The deserts were Meh. The only thing good was the sorbets and they were good, not great.  Overall I had a great meal, we ate a lot and the cooked dishes made the meal... good thing I did not have to pay for it.

This is my favorite sushi place in the phoenix area for a few reasons...  portions are well sized for the price quality is always high they have escolar, which I love - and the best place I've ever had it raw. they have fresh, real, wasabi the owners are great people!  I wish they had better appetizers (I've never been happy with them so I no longer get them) and desert (I don't like mochi and the others are not very good IMO)

I've been here once and it was a very poor experience. 45 minutes to get a car wash.  I did a groupon so we'll see if my next 2 visits are better.  Problems started immediately... it took 10 minutes for me to be asked to leave the car AFTER the attendant took my order. An only because the supervisor say I was waiting an the line was very slow  Then I watched my car get parked and 4 other cars that came out after my car - all got finished and drove off before I said something to the customer service person walking around - 20 minutes later.  They made all sorts of excuses - of course, they did this before bothering to ask or listen to what happened.  The line my car was in only had 1 person working on it while other lines had 2 to 4 people... so of course, they got done much faster.  There was no supervisor making sure things got done.  Finally the supervisor came over, apologized and got the car done himself.  To top it off, they clearly did not do as good of a job as the other cars I saw - since they made mine a rush job.

Top quality and tasty dishes. Portions are very small for the prices. I like it but cannot justify the prices as there are many places just as good but far less expensive. If they would lower the cost or increase the portions 30% I would go often.

I do think the prices are a bit high on some things... only the smaller plates and "sandwich type" foods are under $10... all entree's are higher than $10. Many of the entrees are overpriced by 10-20%. The food ranges from good to great - no telling what it will be until you try it.  They don't have saganaki on the menu but they have it... you sould pass anyway, it is not that good. I had better at the yearly greek festival, really!  The potatoes they give with all entrees are so-so. They should offer a sub of one of their other apps - these are MUCH better.  I recently had an entree special, stuffed pork chops - they were excellent. Good portion for the $15, very satisfied with this dish.  I've also catered a large party with a mix of their platters, etc... good value for these and good quality and flavor... recommended.

We buy quite a bit of produce and a few other items here. Never had good luck with the red meat - it is always too lean, tough. Sometimes they have good Ahi Tuna and the sausages are good. The bulk items, when they are on sale, are a good deal.

If you don't like spice or fantastic flavors or high quality food then don't go here. ;)  This is not the standard Thai food, it is far better. One of my favorite places to eat for dinner.  All the dishes are very good to superb. Many are traditional family recipes of the owner's mom and you will not find them ANYWHERE ELSE.  The wine list is nice (ask about wines not on the list) and the prices are very reasonable.  Favorite items...  Steamed Muscles appetizer - the broth has more flavor and aroma then you will find in 99% of the food you'll ever eat anywhere  Musman Shortrib entree - SAVORY, you'll want to lick the plate!  Coconut ice cream dessert - home made creaminess... I cannot get enough!

Very good hotel breakfast buffet for the price - I travel a lot work work for a buffet that has a huge variety, everything is fresh, and they have made to order items - $25 is a very good price. They have a ton of options and real maple syrup (a rarity).  $25 might seem like a lot if you are used to Denny's but for a resort hotel and a very, very good breakfast buffet, this is a great deal.

The food here is good, upper end for a chain. The steak I had was done perfectly -and the pasta vodka with ricotta filled pockets was very nice.  Now the reason for the low score...  The place was single large room packed with people. Not great if you want a semi-relaxing meal... and when I'm spending a decent coin I don't want to be crammed into a massive room with a few hundred people and hear everyone's conversation from all over the place.  We had coupons so the price was fine but at regular price, for the same $, I'd go to several other places with better food and a better, relaxing and more quiet, atmosphere.

Went here for the wife's birthday... you'd think at a high-end place they would at least offer a free desert... nope!  Overall the food good but for the price is did not impress at all. There were a few small exceptions. I explain below the entire meal.  I'd go here if someone else was paying but for the $170 (including tip) for 2 people with a half bottle ($20) wine I have had MUCH better food and better experience and many other places.  My Suggestion - Spend your high-end $ else where unless you are very wealthy and can drop $170 on dinner like most people would drop $10 on lunch.  Wild Mushroom Soup (sans foie gras) was excellent... worth $10, no but very very tasty.  Duck Two Ways was good, not great. If it had more veggie or a starch with it the $28 would have been a decent deal - but it lacked those so still a bit over priced.  Prix Fixe menu was smoked salmon starter, escolar (one of my favs), veal cheeks, two cheeses, and desert... for $75. For the amount of food it really should be about $55, tops. It was good, not great, let me explain...  Smoked Salmon was excellent... really very, very good... but it was a mere sliver like a sliver of prosciutto.  Escolar (my favorite white fish) was so-so. It was cooked maybe a bit too much and the sauce was did nothign for the fish except maybe cover the delecate, sweet flavor up... or the over cooking or maybe it was not a good cut of the escolar - could not tell.  Veal Cheeks stood out as very good... though the sauce was too thick/heavy and masked much of the natural veal flavor... hint for those that want to get Veal Cheeks here... get the sauce on the side!  Cheeses were excellent, good portion too - no complaints.  Desert was the Gateau Marjolaine - EXCELLENT. Just get it!

What's the Deal? (why the rating) This is the first time we had been there. The place is good but the food was not very unique, the ambiance is not - well anything, and the service was barely average. Why you ask. Let me tell you...  Bang for the Buck: 2/5 - I believe there are better places in Phx that have more creative dishes, just as high quality food and good service.   Decor: 2/5 - nothing special. It is a restaurant in a golf resort... it looks and acts like it.   Ambiance: 3/5 - Small brightly lit room with high ceilings and with a few tables. Not crowded but not private or unique. There were tables outside which would have been great since it was a nice night and it was very quiet out there, but they did not seat anyone there, nor did they offer to.  Service: 5/5 - very friendly and accommodating. I was not happy that as more people showed up our server, who was providing excellent service, dissapeared for long periods of time. We did not get our wine with dinner and the guy that served our meals did not know we ordered wine. They did take care of it. Our steaks were also overcooked a bit. It was a great cut of meat and we ordered medium rare, they came medium. The server did reduce the bill to compensate, which was appropriate - and nice.  Food Quality: 5/5 - very good quality. everything we had was excellent  Food Quantity: 3/5 - maybe a bit under average portions for the price, though it is a resort so they are taking advantage of that I'm sure.  Food Uniqueness & Creativity: 5/5 - get the items that look unique, you will enjoy them.  Food Flavor: 5/5 - they do very well in this area. all items we had were excellent.  Last Experience...  9/17/2010 We went for the $40 Restaurant Week menu. They offered a 3 glass wine paring with the 3 course meals for an extra $15 - we did this also.  black bean hummus with flat bread - SUPERB. The flatbread crackers were also excellent and had a bit of spice.  Peppercorn Crusted Petit Filet Mignon: Local Infused Bernaise Sauce, Roasted Red Potatoes & Iitoi Onions, Broccolini - 3/5, tender and very smooth flavor. Nothing special  Local Farmer's Ratatouille (MUST get!) - 6/5, yes, really! - pan seared Mole Crusted Tofu was fantastic, and I don't like tofu. A standout dish. Great flavors, complex, and left me wanting more. I'd go back for this.  Oven Roasted Game Hen (amazing!) - 6/5, yes, really! - Lavender & Red Inca Quinoa with Dried Stone Fruit, Wild Mushroom Reduction, Pickled Pineapple. - The delicate flavors worked so well together. Every bite was juicy and a soothingly delicious.   Arizona Style Cheesecake: With Mesquite Fennel Pollen Crust - 3/5, just cheesecake. good cheesecake but nothing special. Maybe sprinkle the same crust bits all over to allow it to add more unique flavor?  Local Citrus Brulee: With lingonberry compote - 1/5, too much citrus for my taste. everyone at the table thought so also

Nice happy hour just wish the selection was a bit larger. Food quality is excellent - the rolls are good sized and very tasty.  I've never had a problem with the service as a few others have stated. Though, it is never busy one the weekday evenings when I have been there.

We had a 9 people in total. This place is very large but NOT setup to have a party larger than 7 at a single table, -1  The place was empty on a Monday night, which might be expected, which was perfect for the enjoyment of the conversation - not sure what it would be like normally.  The menu options were nice and it was difficult to decide. I chose the Kobe Flat Iron steak, medium rare. It was a tad over cooked but very tender - as I would expect. The flavor was a bit lacking.   The apps are not really made to share. Though they were good, they need more 'group friendly' apps, -1  The deserts sounded creative and flavorful - on paper. I guess it is the magic of the English language BUT that magic could not make them taste good. They were below average, at best. -1  The entree's do no come with any veggies - only starch sides. They did provide some nice greens when I asked. I try to eat healthy so green veggies are a must - no salad is not enough.  Wine selection was good but that is no trick in Vegas, or anywhere else where just the dinner will be min $50 per person.   I would not likely go back here... based on the price/flavor ratio there are FAR BETTER.

This review is about the Espresso Blend and the service - I have not tried any other blends as I drink mainly straight espresso so I'm very picky with the beans.  Randy is a great guy. I buy a lb every week or two depending on my work travel schedule. I explained I like very fresh beans and he has been very accommodating. I call, ask when he is going to roast next and try to make sure I pick it up in a day or two after.   Now the beans... Very good blend. It is a light City Roast which, in my coffee geek-dom over the last 12 years, has shown that I prefer this style espresso roast. The flavors are good with med complexity and it works well with milk drinks too... the milk does not kill the complexity.  It is an all-around good blend for both straight shots and milk drinks and I have made this my daily beans :)

I've eaten at Jersey Mikes Subs a few times... usually this location and I always find the subs lacking flavor. On top of that the prices are more expensive than Jimmy Johns, and I think JJs has better subs all around.

Another coffee bar... whoopie. These are a dime a dozen now in Phx... and nothing changes.  This place gets 2* only because they have some unique milk drinks like coconut (real milk - no flavoring), etc - otherwise it would get only 1*  In all it is a concrete, bare, store front with no aesthetic appeal that serves coffee drinks and had little to no A/C running in the AZ summer heat... wow, so unique ;)

This place is all about the food and service. The facilities are nice and outdoor seating is pretty good to.  Food Quality - 8/10 Food Flavors - 8/10 Portion size - 8/10 Price - 7/10... it on the higher side but not crazy expensive.  I have been here a few times and will be back many more I'm sure.

Apps were good.  Great space to hang,  relax, and chat. If it gets busy it gets loud and not "intimate" since it is basically one large room.   This is really more of an older crowd (40s-50s-60s) pickup joint / bar than anything else.   A good place to hang for an early nibble and a drink but not a place I'd go to have a serious meal or to hang out too long since I'm not cougar hunting. ;)

Went here for my B-Day. Totally unimpressed with the steaks. The BS they spout about the 'Shula Cuts' being higher quality than Prime is laughable after eating there. I buy and make Prime steaks at my house that are 100x better and cost $8/lb from Costco.  Filet was decent, but nothing special Cowboy Ribeye was bad. Way too lean and tough. No flavor.  The sides, Creamed Spinach and Roasted Corn were both fantastic, though overpriced for the quantity. Quality & Flavors were excellent.  Service was excellent.  I go to a lot of top-end places: Flemings, Mortons, Ditka's, etc... Shulas was the least impressive. I found The Keg to be better by a mile - even without considering the price.

*WARNING* VERY POOR VALUE  I've never posted so strongly before but I felt I must warn people strongly.  Read my ratings I've VERY FAIR - I eat out a lot at a huge variety of places... hole in the wall (like Contigo) all the way to $150-200 person meals  I bought the Yelp coupon after reading good reviews... it was a bad move.  I've had good and great Peruvian food in many places. This is average, at best.  This place should be WAY cheaper due to... - plain & cheap decor (low-end) - located in  low-end strip mall in low end part of town - low quantity of food they give  - VERY hungry when we left.  ordered 2 dishes, 1 appetizer, and 3 alcoholic drinks... $80+ with tip!   We went on a week night for dinner... we were the ONLY people there the entire 1.5 hrs.  Specifics...  Pisco Sour - 1 star -- Nothing special for flavor. I've had much better Pisco Sours double the size for less $...$6 for a 6 ounce glass which was mostly ice is a rip off!   Shrimp Ceviche - 2 stars -- They cared more about presentation than quantity or flavor. $15+ that was the size of my fist. Should have been at least 2x the size it was for the price.  Main Entrees - 2 stars -- flavors were fine but nothing special. food quantity was half the size it should have been.  then to top it off... I added wrong on the check and the $10 I would have saved with the coupon was canceled out... and the owner did not even mention it to me... and charged my CC the wrong amount. So... either he did not check the #s or he was dishonest.   MAYBE this place has decent lunch specials, and I'm being VERY GENEROUS with that assumption.

Unprofessional, uncaring company. Don't waste your time.  I have been on thier list for several years. In the distant past I'd be asked to do a few focus groups a year. In the past 2-3 years I have been bugged (email & phone) by them nearly every month but had never "qualified" until a month ago. They, with 1 month's notice, asked me to join an evening group. I accepted BUT when I showed up they stated that I called to cancel - which I did not. The "supervisor" told me they had a "paper trail"... which is a joke since they only had a date but no time or person that took the call. They refused to pay me for the time.  In all, I've wasted a good 30-60 minutes every 2 months, on average, for 3 years and another 1.5 hours going to a group  ... in all about 25-30 hours of time for no compensation.

This place used to be Thai Pots. Back when I started going here, the first week they opened, many years ago it was so small it only say 10 people and did mostly takeout. Over time they grew popular and expanded, eventually moving into a larger spot in the same complex and updating the decor to something more suiting their food quality.  It is mainly your standard Thai fare with a few surprises here and there since they expanded the menu. Nothing crazy mind you and it will not compare with Latitude 8 in downtown Chandler, but the prices are far less expensive and the menu more expansive.   So the food... very good. They have very good curries and the traditional Thai entrees are excellent.  The lunch specials are a good price at $8 - you get a lot of good quality and good tasking food.  Overall this is an above average Thai place where the selection is very good, the food is high quality and you cannot go wrong with anything you order.

Had breakfast there - VERY GOOD.  Food quality and quantity was great and the price was exactly what I'd expect for a reasonably priced breakfast.   Coffee was decent, not great - if the coffee was better it would have gained another star as great coffee is required for a great breakfast.  I cannot wait to go back.

I love most of the food here... but PLEASE get good coffee.   The drip coffee here is horrible and has been forever. It is watered down tasting. Maybe it is just crap/cheap coffee or they try to save money by not using enough grounds per carafe. Ether way, it is horrible.   Best hits here are any of the deli sandwiches, matso ball soup, and lox & bagel. I avoid most of the other stuff as it cannot compare in taste. Breakfasts are standard fare... nothing great, nothing horrible.

I had not been to an Oregano's in like 10 years. They seems to be popping up all over here in AZ now so my buddy was in from out of town and he wanted to try, so why not.  I'll tell you "Why NOT"... we has two thin crust pizzas... and I even hate to call them that. More like... crackers with melted cheese and some toppings.  That was some of the worst excuse for pizza I've ever had. Most of the fast-food delivery pizza I've had beats it -- and I do not like, at all, delivery pizza.  Maybe the pan pizza is better than the thin crust... god it could not be worse!  It only deserves one star for the good service... other than that is the another sub-par overpriced "gourmet" pizza joint.  If you want expensive, and good, pizza there are many good alternatives... Pizzeria Bianco, Grimaldi's, etc.

Very average BBQ.  Sides are not very good, at all: Beans are thick like cement with out-of-the-can flavor Russian Cabbage is WAY too sweet and mushy Mashed Potatoes were pretty good, but not special  Meats All WAY too dry. Brisket had good flavor so the moist parts were very good - but most was way too dry Chicken had decent flavor Tri-Tip might have been OK but it was tough and dry  And it is pretty expensive.  For this kind of scratch Rudy's rules over this place.

Really glad to see Rudy's move into AZ. I ate there all the time in Austin.  They would get 5 stars if they'd add some sides that were reasonably healthy... green salad, steamed veggies, etc... I NEVER eat there, I always get take out since I want some side that won't make me gain 5 lbs.  Come on owners... buy a clue here!

More miss than hit...  Coconut cupcake: 0/5 Horrible. cake part has no flavor, icing on top tastes like 95% butter and 5% cream cheese... YUCK!   Blackberry & Almond Dumpling: 1/5 The flavor of the 10% that had any blackberry and almond (which as only on the very bottom) was perfect... but that left 90% of the pastry that was simply bread with no flavor.  Strawberry Crostada: 1/5 took one bite, stopped there. tasked bad  Apple Crostada: 3/5 Very good flavor, needs 2x the apples in it to make it enjoyable  Blueberry Crostada: 5/5 FINALLY something I thought was worth buying, and I enjoyed it!  I could taste blueberry the whole time and there were enough actual blueberries!

The Good..  Service:  there on a Wed so the place was nearly empty. Thus, we got thier full attention. The bartender, who I suspect was the manager, was great. We did not like the Pinot on happy hour (tasted like grape juice) even after he opened a ne bottle. They had no problem replacing it with his pairing for our dishes and he comp'd a desert since we were celebrating the birth of our 2nd child.  Food: We had the Pork Chop (5 stars) & Pork Loin (3 stars).  Chop was perfect, nothing more to say there. Loin had nice flavor with a bit of smoke but was way too dry even with the sauce. If it was moist it would have been  5 stars.  Areas for improvement: Very Dark , though eye adjusted OK after a bit Very cold - needed to be a bit warmer to be 100% comfortable Music went from OK to very bad electronic music. Need something more consistant to set the atmosphere better IMO   We will be going back.

Very Expensive for what you get ... even for an airport  The "POG" sounded great, and the flavor was pretty good, BUT I'm not sure if I got one that had been sitting or what...  crust was completely soggy, except the edges ricotta cheese was only a shadow - like it had been over cooked and evaporated  I might try them again but I would not spend my own money doing it.
