SERVICE DEPARTMENT:  They were finally able to figure out my alarm issue on my 2015 Ford Escape. I was having the theft alarm randomly sounding for about a year. There was no rhyme or reason or any pattern that anyone could figure out. I had taken it in to a previous dealership a handful of times only to be turned away by "could not reduplicate the problem." At first Bell Ford was having the same issue where they could not reduplicate it, but Bob my service technician said he encouraged the mechanics to keep trying as I even had video. Sure enough they figured out that it was a  ignition issue. Basically my car was trying to start itself. I cannot tell you what a relief it is to finally have someone who truly cares about the work that they do. I would definitely recommend Bell Ford service department to anyone. The only thing I would say is they are not super communicative, and it would have been nice to receive a follow up phone call the day after. My car was in from Monday to Wednesday. But other than that, phenomenal.

Emailing this company is next to impossible. At one time, I was receiving emails from 3 separate people which was very confusing to me. They are very unresponsive as compared to other rental companies in the valley. My last email was as follows:    This seems very expensive as compared to a competitor. Your quote is about $6,000 more, and theirs also includes swag. I am confused as to why this is such a huge discrepancy, even though you stated it is "slightly off". Not sure what that means. Overall, I will be choosing the more affordable option.     Thanks for your time.     Lucia     Instead of a clarification of the quote cost, the email I received was as follows:    We will cancel the order. Thank you, NB    Overall, I did not feel valued as a customer. They did not care to have my business. I went with another company because they responded to my emails within 1-2 days, and always addressed my questions. I also only spoke with one person, which made me feel less confused.

I was never approached by any of the stores sale associates in the BCBG section or the dress section. They are too busy chatting with each other than taking care of their customers.

I took out $50 cash because I wanted to give it as a graduation present. I waited for Carlos see if he could exchange the two 20s and two fives that were dispensed to me from the self check out machine, but he told me, "Do you want to walk over to customer service? Because I don't have a key." Ummmmmm no.   Customer service is just not what it used to be...

I do want to first say that our waitress, Nicole, was wonderfully energetic, spunky, and attentive.   My personal opinion of this place is that at one time it was probably really good. As they proudly have awards displayed out as you walk in from 2007. Unfortunately, it is now sub-par.   I have eaten at Bella Luna on two occasions. The first was with my fiancé and father (who's Italian). He ordered carbonara and LOVED it. I was not impressed with my Bolognese. We did want to give it another shot though as we are contemplating where to have our rehearsal dinner this fall.   My fiancé and I ordered the calamari. It was bland and definitely not seasoned enough. It really felt as if it was just breaded and fried with a sprinkling of parsley on the top. My fiancé ordered the lasagna. As it came out, it looked yummy. When I tasted it, it was over cooked and flavorless. When I asked him if he liked it he said, "I like the one from Costco better." I had the Fettuccine Alfredo with pancetta and peas. Now I do think this dish tasted very good. It was fairly soupy, but overall I was satisfied. We both did have a tummy ache as we left.   Unfortunately we will not be having our rehearsal dinner at Bella Luna as depending on what you order it is a 50/50 on whether you will like it or not.   I do not want to offend anyone in these further comments, but I really think this place is for Robert Irvine in restaurant impossible. He would have a hay day with this place. The decorations are tacky, the table cloths are not ironed (ours still had crumbs on it when we were sat), and the lay out needs work. The kitchen entrance is open to the main dining area and they have to walk through the front door to get to their tables on the patio. I was told to wait as I attempted to enter because a server was coming out to the patio with food. If I hadn't been notified of this, there would have been a collision of sorts for sure.

I was trying to convince my husband how good Rubio's is (my usual location is in Buckeye off of Estrella), and this place made him question my love for Rubios. The lettuce was old and the blackened mahi was almost burned it was so blackened.

Brides by Demetrios made my dress venture so memorable and unforgettable. Their hospitality really was outstanding.   It was a Saturday and my mom was in town from Missouri. So we were on a mission to find my dress. I had booked two appointments, and did not have any luck at Destinys Bride (see my review) or Mariee Bridal. I called brides by Demetrios to see if they could pencil me in if they had any cancellations. Sure enough they called and got me in. Christine was amazing and wonderful at listening to the style of dress I wanted in our price range. She made me and my family feel welcome and comfortable. I felt like she was committed and happy to be helping me find my dress. When we finally found it, she gave us an additional $50 on top of the 15% sale discount they were having that weekend.   Start your wedding dress shopping here. You won't be disappointed!!

The bread was sub-par as the bagel was crisp and overly salty. The butter was frozen and un-spreadable.   The calamari was OK not the best and not memorable.   Service-The waitress was polite, but not as interested in us as we did not order an inordinate amount of booze. The busser touched my father's fork on the head of it instead of the handle. Yuck.  The steaks were OK but I've had better at Texas Road House to be quite honest. The additional char on the steaks is worth it, and makes a definite difference as my dad had his prepared this way and I did not.  The gold brick dessert was pretty good, but the chocolate was very frozen.

The first time we went to Cibo it was delightful. The second time, not so much. First my fiancé had a dirty glass to where you could visibly see the old lipstick mark. Although not preferred, this isn't something that would affect us from coming back or not. Then we noticed a hair in our pizza, which to me is unacceptable. They replaced it with no issue. They did, however, rush the replacement pizza out which wasn't cooked properly. It did not have much taste either. The waiter did not offer a discount but oddly gave me the wrong amount of change for our bill. Wasn't too sure if this was his way of apologizing, but overall was a very lousy experience.

Good tailors are hard to come by, and the average menswear salesman does not have the knowledge to point you in the right direction. After my experience in the valley, I must say that Minas  is absolutely the best tailor in all of Phoenix. He is very experienced and knowledgeable about suit fit, colors, fabrics, and definitely has a passion for it.   Don't waste your time looking elsewhere. We were looking for a navy blue grooms suit, and we could not find anything. He made us a custom suit and it is beautifully made.   We are 100% happy. He gave us a free tie, too.

My fiancé and I went to try Papaadeauxs on a Friday during Lent. We were not disappointed. The service was superior. Our waitress always checked on us and made sure we always had full drinks.   We ordered the oysters papaadeaux and the only thing I'd say is they were a bit salty, but nonetheless delicious. The creme brûlée also did not disappoint!!

I was very pleased with the boarding. I had a horrific previous experience at Canine Country Club, but here my dog was returned to me happy, healthy, clean, and most importantly bug-free. He stayed 6 days.   The reason I gave it a 4 is because the receptionist who checked me in seemed reluctant to give me my 10% off for filling out the online form prior to coming in. I had to inquire about it, had I not mentioned it my bill would have been 20 dollars more.

This place is a must go for anyone in the valley. In my personal and professional Italian opinion (wink, wink), their calamari is TO DIE FOR. It is quite possibly the best calamari I have ever had...EVER! The little baby corn and the dipping sauce is delightful. If you go, you must dig deep into your pockets and pay the extra dollar for the Kobe beef. It is melt in your mouth delicious and absolutely, without a doubt heaven for your tastebuds! The staff is wonderful about spacing out appetizers, salads, etc. I am definitely this places #1 fan. Top 5 of my favorites list in the entire valley.

We had the best experience. We are sushi goers and we ordered the Marilyn Monroe, geisha roll, and spicy crunch roll. It is slightly expensive, but the service is top notch and we were impressed  with our overall experience. The drinks were divine, and we will be back!

Love this place. The only bad part is they've done away with the valet and parking is simply terrible. Their Malbec is absolutely my favorite. I crave their bruschetta on the daily. So delish!

We had really good service. The only two things I would say is the calamari is not good and one of my sides were cold. The side was replaced immediately with no fuss. Would definitely eat there again.

I have experienced 3 vet clinics since purchasing my Olde English Bulldogge. I used to live in central Phoenix and go to Squaw Peak Animal Hospital, which we loved! But unfortunately we moved to the west side. My first vet experience was horrific, but then I found these guys.   The staff is very welcoming and helpful. They talk to you and make you feel like they want the best for your fur baby. When my dog is sick, they quickly make an appointment. The front office staff has even flagged down the vet for me as I had an emergency case close to 5 o'clock. (We're talkin 4:55).   My previous experience at a vet not far from here was HORRIFIC in comparison. They have a customer for life.   I also love the small business feel.

I have boarded my dog at the Avondale location on numerous occasions. The first time he wasn't neutered yet, and when he came home he had quarter sized sores on his genitals that were scabbed over. This was not reported to me in his checkout. The second time I boarded he did the daycare and had a scabbed nose, this was also not reported to me. I understand dogs get rough when they play, but I want to know about it.   I also take him to their daycare on Saturdays. Once I requested a late pickup, and I was swarmed by employees very aggressively telling me how my dog is too hyper and he gets too "intense" when he plays. They tried to lessen their approach by first saying he's still welcome, but the approach was less than welcoming. They also raised the price of the daycare from $11 to $22 without posting or letting me know this increase upon check-in. When I went to pay for my dog, he had already been there all day so I had no choice but to pay the increased amount. That day I dropped him off I also requested that I be told if he is placed in time out at all, and the lady said to me, "Yeah we have a pretty rough group out there...they don't like rough dogs."   Now, as an overprotective mommy, this made me feel totally unwelcome, and I'm afraid it was the icing on the cake with my overall experience with this place. Their prices also continually seem to increase. We will no longer be utilizing their facility due to not feeling welcome, not being adequately reported on injuries, and outrageous prices that are not communicated properly.

I called discount sprinklers and was charged $470 to fix my lawn valve and 4-5 leaks in my drip. To my dismay, one month later my drip system would not shut off. Come to find my other valve from the drip went bad (which they checked when they initially came a month ago). The company did come back free of charge, and was flexible.

I had a color and style by Lorraine about two weeks ago, and I am absolutely thrilled! She definitely made me feel comfortable as she explained to me how she prefers to er on he side of caution when doing blonde as she wants to make sure my hair is healthy. She also didn't give me any bull about me loving my hair right away because she explained how it would take a few weeks for the brown ombre root to fade. This is exactly what happened, and I completely value her being honest. I had gone into the shop a little fearful because my previous hair stylist (I had been going to her for three years) just wasn't giving me the end result I wanted. Instead of an ombré I got golden highlights to the root.   Not only is Lorraine a lovely stylist, so easy to talk to and I felt that the conversation we had never dulled, but she is also incredibly talented when it comes to hair. Not once did I feel nervous that she was going to mess up my hair as she always seemed to know what she was doing, which I admit gave me a huge confidence in her. I was worried about my hair going orangey blonde as it has a couple times before when I have tried to dye it, but my hair turned out a lovely ashy, sandy blonde and I am in love with it. I can't wait to go back. I highly recommend this salon to anyone who needs a change and has trust issues (ha!) ;)

The food was great. The stuffed mushrooms were yummy! The reason I am voting a 2 is because the service is horrible. We waited a good 15 minutes before we were approached for dessert/check/anything else. When I asked for a coconut macaroon (that were showcased right next to us on the bar), it took the server another 5 minutes to get me one. When I tasted it, it was very mushy and not worth the calories. The server asked me if I liked it, and when I said I didn't like it instead of apologizing she asked me if I had ever had a macaroon before. Who asks that? Then tells us, "Well, it was only a $1.50."   Probably won't be going back.

Sandy is a sweet women. On first impression I was a little taken aback by her dramatically long lashes...definitely not the look I was going for but I had driven a good 30 minutes out to her house so I decided to trust her expertise of 3 years doing extensions. I said I wanted something more natural looking, and I must say she definitely gave me a more natural look when all was said and done.   The reason I give 1 star is because after I left I had horrible experiences occur. Now being a lash extension virgin, I read you're not "supposed" to remove them yourself. However, she had glued some of the extensions to my lower lid so I had no choice but to pluck them out. When she was done I immediately noticed my right corner felt stuck, and I thought it passed once I blinked a few times. She reassured me that sometimes they pop and all would be well not taking the time to inspect that corner. The next morning I woke up at 5 a.m. because this same eye was irritating me to the point of not being able to sleep. What I think happened was some of the lashes stuck together on that side, and was pulling the skin on my eyelid to the point where I couldn't sleep. I finally gave up and got a needle to separate the lashes and one came loose. Finally, relief!   I also mentioned to her how one of the lashes on the inner side seemed longer. She assured me all the lashes are the same length, and didn't bother checking it out. Being the OCD person I am, I couldn't take my eyes off that one confused lash as I gazed into the mirror. The reason why it looked longer is because it was placed/glued at a slightly different angle. I ended up trimming it so that it is not so noticeable.   Her house is clean, but the area where she does the lashes is by the bar and there is a ton of booze out for all to see. Doesn't really seem professional, and I even contemplated if she was drinking beforehand. All in all, it was not a good first experience.   9 days later update: my right eye that was initially bothering me when she first put on the lashes is still torturing me. I've had to use olive oil to try and get the glue off. I'm currently icing my pissed off eye. Never again. In retrospect, I am curious if she was hungover doing my lashes.

I had such a lovely experience at Sunglass Hut. Angelica and Teresa were so helpful in my search for sunglasses for my fiancé who is very picky. When I told Teresa his likes/dislikes, she found me the absolute perfect pair of sunglasses for him. When they discovered I'd be shipping them, they helped me to purchase them online with no shipping cost. They were so friendly and made my shopping experience a breeze. Thank you girls!

I just spent 30 minutes looking for a scarf and wasn't approached a single time for help. However the three employees had enough time to gather at the entrance talking about how one of them was going to Rocky point. I was dressed down and comfortable in a pullover and sneakers, and this is the first time I've ever noticed them treat me differently.

Alex is simply wonderful. I do not own a piece of lingerie. So I did not know what the heck to get much less how to work any of the stockings, guarder belts, etc. I was able to find 3 really cute outfits and she would be honest in her opinion for every outfit I tried on. She know what complimented my body best, which I loved. I had tried going to another lingerie store previously and I felt like everything there was one size fits all...and us women are NOT one size fits all. Alex definitely caters to any size and shape woman. I definitely recommend going here for lingerie. It was a lovely experience.

I got there at 230, a little before my friend who bought a groupon for buy one get one 55 minute massage. They took my friend back first who got there after me. 10 minutes later they came to get me. The masseuse told me she didn't want to rush me, but that she had another appointment at 255 so she couldn't do a full body. I was shocked because it wasn't my fault that I couldn't get a full body as I was on time. She asked me what area I wanted to have focused on. She massaged my back, my right arm, and barely my legs. I didn't even flip and she didn't touch my left arm.   I won't be going back.

Kris was very knowledgeable, efficient, and quick to respond to my many questions regarding renting a tent for my wedding.  I would choose them over Any other tent company any day just based on my customer experience alone.  Other businesses I found were impossible with communication. Kris made me feel like he truly cares about having me as a customer, and he goes above and beyond to help. I know my wedding day will be beautiful and I can thank Kris for that!

Petz place is always overwhelmingly helpful when it comes to my furry friend. The groomers are amazingly sweet, and always making sure the place smells fresh. They're immediately solving the problem when there is an odor in the store. In shopping for my pet grooming needs, the salespeople gave me a great recommendation for my olde English Bulldogge who sheds a ton.   Today I was just looking for some treats for my dog and I was approached by 3 different sales people asking if I needed assistance. It felt great knowing there's always someone ready and willing to help if I have a question. Not always the case when at petsmart.   Great experiences I've had here so far!

I called to inquire about whether they had a particular suit for my fiancé. The guy who answered the phone was very abrupt and didn't speak clearly, and when I didn't respond right away he said, "Hello!" I then asked if I had called the right place because surely I had dialed the wrong number, but no it was the right place. When I asked my question he said, "No." It was like I was inconveniencing him with this call and my questions. He did not seem like he wanted to help.   This call is the reason I will not set foot inside this store.

I love this place. Teresa is so professional and a perfectionist. She is honest with you about what will look the best. She also doesn't push anything additionally, like callous remover if you truly don't need it. Tony is also has phenomenal customer service. He remembers my name and makes me feel vaulted as a customer. Love that!   They give a discount if you pay in cash. Best to make an appointment because there's only two of them there, but they're both awesome. Definitely recommend.

We were excited to try this restaurant. When we came in, we decided we were going to order burgers. My husband ordered the green chile burger and I got the gringo. They messed up our order and brought us both green chile burgers (not a problem...usually)...I let the waiter know the mixup. He leaves for a bit as I enjoy my sweet potatoe fries and ranch. He then rushed back and asks if he can have my plate that they "don't believe him" in the back. DEFINITELY not something to tell the customer. After waiting quite a while I get my burger, and there's no longer ranch with my fries (waaaa, but at this point I'm hungry and tired of waiting). The burger is gross and I eat a few bites. I should've kept the mix up from the beginning. The waiter then came back at the end and gave us these gamut of excuses as to why we received such poor service. It was really ridiculous actually. I don't think we will ever be going back unless maybe just to drink whiskey.

Loved this place! My friend and I were in the hurry to catch a movie and this place was quick and delish. We ordered wine and 2 appetizers. We got the calamari, which as an Italian calamari snob I must say was so scrumptious. We also ordered the Greek meatballs which was perfect to split between two people as we each got 3 pieces. Usually they give odd portions, so I was glad that it was equal servings. Definitely coming back! Great people and super friendly.

Love Kelly. Her nails truly last a good 2-3 weeks as compared to any other walk-in nail salon. The only thing I would say is she tends to run 10-15 minutes behind schedule fairly consistently. But she is very flexible if you have to reschedule.

When we arrived at destiny's bridal we were slightly early, but they only had one other bride there so it wasn't a huge deal. When I told the lady my price range she had a bewildered look (because the majority of their dresses are more than $2,000) and stated most of these priced dresses were in the back. We told her what we were looking for and she hurriedly threw about 5-6 dresses in a room for me. She did not offer to help me try them on, but rather left me in there with my mom. When we looked at the dresses chosen for us, none of them had any beading or pretty detail. We told her how these dresses weren't what we were looking for, so she rushed to the back to try to find something else. When she returned, she brought a dress that was disgustingly dirty at the bottom. My mom said, "I think this dress has met its destiny." Lol. The lady explained that this would be the dress I would be wearing...and couldn't order a new one but that it would be $1500 at 50% off. She said they would obviously dry clean it. $1500 for a dirty dress that looks like it's already been worn? No thank you.   This shop for you if:  1. You plan on spending more than $2,000 on your dress.  2. You're ok with trying on dirty dresses.  3. You're ok with not being helped to try on the dresses.
