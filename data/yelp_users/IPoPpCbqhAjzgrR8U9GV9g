Last minute tickets for the Cher concert got us bad nose bleed section seats. Section 220 row 11....you can barely see the stage because it's so far away, and unfortunately you only see the side stage, and the big screens. Not the fault of the arena. But, if you're afraid of heights, don't sit all the way up there....the rows have a huge incline.  Other than that, we had a great time. Seats were as comfy as they were going to get for an arena. Sound and lights were good. Bathrooms super clean and big, fair amount of concessions for beer, water and sodas. A couple of food concessions too.  Security was great....lines weren't that bad to get in, lots of personnel and security presence. The a/c was working really well, but of course it wasn't 110 degrees outside either.  All in all, good venue....seen better and worse.

I may be stuck in my ways....but that's a good thing at Miracle Mile. I always get the New Yorker on a kaiser roll. Corned beef and pastrami with coleslaw. Sloppy, delicious and juicy. Sometimes I get it with fries and sometimes with potato salad, but either way it's always delish.  Cafeteria style, fast service, clean, loud and busy! Just like NYC...and they have Dr. Brown's, if you know what I mean.  Just tried the bread pudding for the first time. Nothing to write home about, but still very good. Lots of raisins....  Great deli, if not the best in Phoenix.

Quick stop at the mall, and figured this was the healthiest choice for lunch. Love my chicken walnut sandwich on molasses bread and my free chocolate chip cookie :)  Usually I get a pick two ( combo half sandwich with a soup or salad) but was feeling like a whole sandwich today. Mall location is okay, the restaurant locations are much better.  Nice staff and quick service, not a bad place .

I know, I know....a five star for a chain restaurant. But seriously the steaks are absolutely delicious here.  Sure it's not Ruth Chris served with sizzling butter....but there are two "made from scratch" sides always included! Their steaks are always prepared exactly how I ask, very little fat,  juicy and thick.  The 6 oz  sirloin is pretty close to the tenderness of a filet.   We ate here on a Thursday night, arriving at 5:30 and it was pretty crowded.  We chose to eat at the bar, which was great because we got excellent service and met a few interesting people.   As soon as we sat down, we had delicious hot rolls and cinnamon butter sitting in front of us. So good, you can't keep them full in the basket.  Also a big bucket of peanuts at the bar will keep you busy while cracking them open. We ordered ribs for an appetizer which were crazy delish, falling off the bone smothered with a really nice mild bbq sauce, which didn't over power the smokiness of the ribs.    We both ordered the 6 oz sirloin, mine with baked potato and Caesar salad and my husbands with baked potato and a salad with honey mustard dressing. Caesar's was tasty and the dressing was spot on. The steaks were perfect....wonderful and flavorful.  If you order extra toppings for your baked potato  (bacon, cheese, sour cream)...they charge with out telling you.   Come Monday thru Thursday before 6pm for dinner and you can get their early bird special and save some $$$ that you can use towards their Legendary Margaritas :)  We always return to this location. Quality food, superb service, fun atmosphere.

I always like this place. The food quality is consistent and the service is worth a 20% gratuity. I enjoy loud restaurants that buzz, so Cheesecake delivers every time .  Menu is overwhelming at times, so I find myself sticking to my faves, such as chicken potstickers, bathing in a sweet soy sauce and black toasted sesame seeds. Depending on our hunger level, farfella with chicken and roasted garlic is full of flavor and perfect to share....a little more hunger and we dig into the spicy cashew chicken over white rice. I would stay away from the burgers, nothing special there.  It's a hit or miss if we order cheesecake, but when we do, it's usually the original cheesecake with strawberries....if the kids are with us, those chocolate lovers order the Godiva or red velvet cheesecake. Either way, they're all delish.   If it's just the two of you and you don't want to wait 30+ minutes to be seated, ask to be seated at the bar or high tops...we usually get seated right away!

Before coming to Earnhardt, we had been to 3 or 4 other dealerships, and felt like we were run through the mill. No need to convince anyone here, that car shopping has got to be one of the top 5 chores no one wants to have to do. But, luckily, we were referred to Earnhardt by Costco, and went through their auto discount program.  As soon as we arrived and were introduced to Riley O'Conor, I knew this was going to be our best car shopping experience ever.  It was easy, quick, calm, confident, feel good and transparent.  I never felt like we were being lied to, pressured, pitted against. Riley did an amazing job AND, if I might add...took care of our financing with such ease, I was almost shocked and couldn't believe it!  Riley showed us the exact car that WE wanted to buy, not the one that HE wanted to sell us, and it came with great deals and incentives (Riley also threw in a little extra accessory freebie for us too)  Once we were ready to drive the car off the lot, Riley sat in the car with us and explained everything about the car and its features.  He really took the time to help and be there for us when we needed it.  Highly recommend Earnhardt Avondale Hyundai and ALL the people, that helped us there. Ask for Riley....you will be happy you did!

This is a steak house the way real steak houses used to be.   Definitely for the more mature crowd...as we are....pushing 50! Loud, dark, excellent service, wonderful food. We came with friends, and would probably not come alone, as it does get loud with crowded tables....definitely would not bring kids.  Some yelpers have said that when they arrive, even with a ressie, they have to wait. We must have been lucky....we were seated immediately for our Saturday night 6:45 ressie. I'm not sure you could get into this place with out one. Oh! And they have valet parking for $7.00( a bit steep)...but there wasn't a spot to be found.  I was very impressed with the food quality...as we started off with a huge plate of onion skins, courtesy of yelp. At the table they give you sliced bagel crisps and rye bread.  I ordered the prime rib 12 oz medium rare with a side Caesar salad, mayo cole slaw,  and baked potato. Unfortunately they ran out of baked potatoes so I got potatoes au gratin. My steak was perfectly cooked and seasoned. I see why everyone loves the coleslaw....one of our guests said that he hadn't eaten a steak this good in a very long time.  Don and Charlie's isn't for everyone, it's not trendy or gourmet....it's just solid good steaks and ribs, older crowd atmosphere, with excellent service you should expect from a great restaurant.

Shop, Eat, drink, play and stay. No need to leave this resort unless you've never been to Vegas, and you want to explore.   Elegant resort with one of THE best casinos.   No tacky and cheap Vegas feel...5 star every where you turn.   Bought a package through groupon which included an invited guest check in...their version of express check in. Only 2 guests ahead of us, where general check in was packed. Check in took less than 5 minutes, and our room was available, no waiting.  Valet parking is included in the resort fee, and if you're leaving the resort after 11am check out, there is a baggage area that can hold your luggage until you're ready to leave.  Stayed in suite 33-127. View of Caesars and the Mirage....pool view below and quite a bit   of rooftop.   Suite was clean as a pin, spacious and one of the newly upgraded. Bathroom had a vanity with evening and day lighted mirror, wall mounted flat screen tv, amenities, robes and a safe. The bed was super comfortable and linens were clean and free of any wear or tear. Bedroom and living room each had flat screen tv's...sunken sitting area, dining table and desk. On one night stand, there was an iPhone charging station with radio (Nice bonus). Even though wi-fi was included in the resort fee, it was painfully slow and cell service in the room was weak.  Our floor was very quiet and smoke free. Casino, although still a bit smokey, has an amazing filtration system and does a great job at minimizing smoke overload and pumping lots of O2 into the air. But still, as I write this, and being far away from Vegas, I can still smell smoke in my nose! Yuck!  All employee contact was polite and courteous and everyone was eager to please. We had great luck at the casino and felt that the payouts were very generous. Plenty of tables and slots.  Excellent variety of restaurants and shops, and of course you have the opportunity to enjoy the gondola's and stroll the romantic Italian piazzas.  Overall, we were extremely pleased with our stay. Would not consider any other resort.

Unresponsive manager and people using their fingers to get food from the buffet! Yuck. Save the $19/pp and go somewhere else.   Ate here on a Saturday morning and ordered the breakfast buffet. Hot plates to put cold fruit on, if you can find a plate at all. Frozen cream cheese next to the strawberries (thinking it's whipped cream).....was so stuck to the serving spoon, that people were using their fingers to get it off on to their plates.  Bacon did not have tongs, and people were using their fingers instead. Tasteless food and chef burning cooked to order eggs was a turn off.  My husband was so dissatisfied with the buffet, that he ordered eggs Benedict off the menu. That was actually better. Hash browns tasted like they came out of a box, but the eggs were fresh and hot and the hollandaise sauce was very good.  When we spoke to the manager, he was hearing me, but not really listening. Did not offer any remedy. All he could tell me was that he would look into quality control. Our server was the one who suggested we order breakfast from the menu.   Walk right on by this restaurant.

We couldn't get into the SW Steakhouse located in the same hotel (Wynn) for dinner, so unfortunately, we were all dressed up and no where to go.  We figured we would try The Buffet, and from the reviews, seemed like a pretty good place to eat. It was a fairly long walk through the casino and then what seemed like a really long lonely hallway to the restaurant.   First tip, do not dress up to eat here...I was so overdressed, it made me feel a bit uncomfortable.  The quality of food (which is excellent) does not match the atmosphere of this very casual buffet.  When you arrive, you're going to get a sense of tackiness...almost like you are eating in Cinderella's castle at Disney....But with all that being said, we had an excellent dining experience.  The food really is great here.  They had a very large selection, from fresh fish, steaks, salads, desserts, you name it, it was on the buffet.  The buffet area is very big and spread out, so there were no lines to wait for food, or people shoving themselves into your plates to reach for something.  Excellent lay out.  The night we were there, they were serving steamed Char Siu Bao in the Asian section, which is a steamed BBQ pork bun. I have eaten these in China towns across the country (NY and SF) included, and these were the best.  They also had a carving station  with massive bone in steaks and  prime rib.  They had amazing breads, vegetables, lasagna, pizzas, pastas, crab legs, lobster, shrimp, fruits, cheeses, caprese salads, ravioli's....the list goes on and on.    There wasn't one thing I tasted that I didn't like, and would have gone back for more, had I not been so full.  The dessert section is not huge, but then, who has room for dessert.  All the desserts such as the cakes and mousses were mini's.  They also served gelatto in a few flavors, which looked great, but I didn't have any that night.  For the two of us, the bill came out to $100 which included tip and beverage. I thought that price was very reasonable for the amount of food offered.  We would definitely make the effort to eat here again, when in Vegas.

My last hoorah in Vegas...just before heading home, we had to have lunch at Carnegie Deli at the mirage. Unfortunately because it was located at the back of the casino, the restaurant was pretty smokey.   Our wait, at 11am on a Sunday morning was about 15 minutes. We came for a huge corned beef and pastrami appetite, but most of the food coming out of the kitchen was breakfast.  My husband and I shared a stuffed derma, (2 large pieces on the dish). One of the best I've tasted...nice and crispy along the casing. We shared a matzoh ball soup. I remember Carnegie serving a softball sized matzoh ball years ago, now it's served with 2 smaller ones. Good chicken stock and very tasty and fluffy matzoh balls. We then shared a Woody Allen (corned beef and pastrami). Huge! Delicious! even better when paired with mustard and pickles.  My husband ordered an egg cream, and he said it was excellent...  Service was horrible, at least our server was. I had to ask for pickles, silverware, our drinks (waited about 10 minutes after ordering).  Tables are really tiny and you can hear every conversation intimately, as the tables are pushed really close together in this tiny place....just like in NYC.  If traveling by car, this should be your last stop, because the sandwiches have about 2 lbs. of meat in them, you'll want to grab a doggie bag to bring home with you.  The two of us ate for just under $50....which by Vegas standards is pretty cheap!

We came back, after a personal invitation from the owner, after a so-so experience at the 59th avenue location. We decided to try out the 83rd (Arrowhead location) second time around. What a world of difference. Staff, service, atmosphere....all was excellent! Including the food. Complimentary garlic bread was delish, and we also started with a wing onion ring combo plate. Yummy wings :) I had the caprese side salad, small but really delicious and fresh and I had a make your own pasta dish with fettuccini, garlic butter, spinach and roasted onions. Butter was Lacking a little flavor, but none the less, very good and pasta was super fresh. My husband had the steak Gorgonzola over fettuccini with a side of antipasto salad. Again, very good. Manager visited our table....server was as sweet as could be. Loved the Italian family style atmosphere....we will be back. Thank you very much for the invitation to dine again :)

Such a fun store! Love the smells, excellent products. Great staff, so helpful, no pressure.  The amazing skin, hair and bath products sell themselves.   My fave product is the Big shampoo. Got a sample about a year ago....and I'm hooked.   Ask for samples, and they are so glad to oblige. I guarantee that the next time you visit this store, you'll be buying the full size product, that's how good this stuff is.

Great farmers market experience....bring lots of cash. Today I bought fresh mozzarella, California cheeses, homemade peanut butter, cookies, bagels, pastries, artisan breads, fresh veggies, pico de gallo, fresh flowers and grass fed beef :) need I say more!  There are a few food trucks, artists, jewelry, baskets, soaps, teas, fruits, juices, candies, honey, olives....I just can't name them all.  We usually get a quick delish breakfast at the cafe at the market, which is always crowded.  My always go to is "Mom and Pops" for my bagels....they have a bakery at 83rd and Union Hills in Peoria as well....and I stumbled upon the best gelato bars on earth made by Doc Brown...artisan ice creams! I had the Tequila Sunrise gelato bar...to die for....and my husband had the piña colada gelato bar, creamy and heavenly!  Seriously, spring at the market is the place to be :)

Since moving from the east coast to Peoria a couple of years ago, it seemed impossible to find a decent Chinese restaurant...but then we found Good China. Now, it's not THE best Chinese food I've ever eaten, but certainly the best I've had since moving here. Restaurant is dimly lit, casual, has reasonable prices, great lunch menu, is clean and nicely updated. The staff has been great every time I have eaten there. I have ordered take out on a Saturday evening and it was ready in 15 minutes. Portions for take out are just as large as when you dine in. My favorite dishes are chicken lettuce wraps (served warm), spring rolls (crispy and not oily), pork steamed dumplings and mu shu pork, which tastes very authentic and served with thin pancakes. Very yummy! We always share an order of pork fried rice, which is probably one of the best I've eaten, and Mongolian beef, which is nice and saucy and best eaten with white rice. I do find that the food here can tend to be salty, and you will need to make sure you've got something wet to chug a lug, but make sure it's not their tap water! It tastes like chlorine, every time. I don't drink soda, so I order iced tea, and I never taste any trace of tap water. It's our go to Chinese restaurant.

Always crowded, always delicious, always closed on Sunday.  Hands down the best tasting, juiciest and yummiest chicken nuggets ever. Dipped in Chick-fil-a sauce, and I'm happy! Not a fan of their waffle fries...never have been, never will. This place is always busy, no matter when you come...because all the food is made fresh to order. Well worth the wait.   Just tried their fresh squeezed lemonade with Splenda and it is soooo good!

I bought a Groupon for window tinting at Quality Bumper. Glad I did. I called to make an appointment and was able to get in the next day. When I arrived, the employees at the desk were eager to please, very professional and courteous. I was told exactly what kind of tinting was going to be installed and how long it would take. There was a small waiting area in the showroom.    There was a good stream of people coming in and out, and the employees really knew what they were talking about. No pressure sales.   My car was ready when they told me it would be.  They did a great job with the tinting, gave me care instructions for the next week and thanked me very much for coming in.   Great service and quality work.  Would recommend Quality Bumper and would definitely go back!

If you've got a burger and bottomless fry craving....Red Robin is the place to go. Good variety of burgers, salads, chicken sandwiches and appetizers.  This visit, as with any other on a Friday or Saturday night, means at least a 20 minute wait and so so service. The place gets so crowded, that it appears the restaurant is always understaffed and the servers are overworked.   If you want something like mayo or special sauce with your fry's, ask for it way in advance, because nothing comes fast around here.  With that being said, the flavored iced teas are yummy here. I favor the pomegranate, my husband likes the peach. The burgers are yuuuummmmm! Always cooked the way I like them (medium rare) and are really tasty. I like the avocado bacon burger ....bunless, wrapped in lettuce. It's like having a side salad :) The bonzai burger and chicken sandwiches are worth trying too.  We never get appetizers here, we just ask for a couple of baskets of fries for the 4 of us. Holds us over until the burgers come. I always ask for the campfire sauce. No extra charge and oh so good.  Sign up for their rewards card. There are always discounts and free appies....as well as a free birthday burger and buy 9 burgers get the 10th free. Burgers can add up fast with a  big family.  So we keep coming back, not for the slow service, but for the fun atmosphere and great burgers.

Que Rico! Brush up on your spanish, because the real Cuban foodies know where to come! This little hole in the wall Cuban restaurant is seriously as authentic as it gets.  I grew up in Puerto Rico, and  I'm telling you, this food is like no other.  Don't try to compare it to the likes of Havana Cafe in Phoenix . This super casual, obscure 5 or 6 table Cuban Cafe and Bakery, is tucked away in a strip mall.     Please believe me, they serve THE best tostones, croquetas de jamon, pan con bistec, ropa vieja, empanada de carne and crazy delicious flan. I'm sure everything else is tasty too, but I get stuck on my faves. This probably doesn't mean a lot to some, but they serve coca cola in tall glass bottles. This is the way the serve it in Mexico, Puerto Rico and Cuba. It just tastes so much better and it goes great with a cubano (cuban sandwich).   There is usually one girl serving the tables, and working the bakery, the owner and one or two other people in the kitchen...so service isn't what you would expect at a 5 star restaurant, but it is what you would expect at a Cuban neighbors or friends house, and that is exactly what you get.  And if you venture into this cafe a few times, the people working there will remember you and you will automatically feel like family.    Prices are great, portions are good and the food is excellent!  Buen Provecho!

Just stumbled upon this place, tucked away in a small strip mall in a business area behind a hotel. Stopped in real quick and bought hummus, tabbouleh and pita. The hummus is yummy! Very tangy...tabbouleh is great too. The pita is packaged elsewhere, but very fresh and delish. This super casual restaurant has a small market with tons of nuts, hard to find middle eastern canned favorites and a small freezer section with phyllo and it looked like meat pies etc.  Their deli area wasn't opened for lunch yet, as I was there in the morning, but the menu looks like it has a great variety such as Kibbei, soups, salads,gyros, kabobs, shawarma, burgers...and they have a kids menu with burgers, dogs, chicken tenders and gyros.  Looking forward to eating lunch here soon. Seems like a really nice mom and pop middle eastern market and grill.

Have been coming here for about a year, and have always had a great experience.   About a month ago, my regular technician quit and I had a male tech do my pedi. It was a horrible experience, he cut me, couldn't stop the bleeding and was laughing. I was appalled and the manager comped my service and gave me a gift card for a free pedi.  So here I am, using my free pedi and I'm happy again :) I asked for a female tech....just seems like the male techs don't do it for me.  The techs use gloves and sterilized tools. I feel safe and confident. They are all very sweet and nice to be around. The chairs are comfy and have a massage option (which my husband likes when he is getting his pedi) and they always have a movie running to pass the time away. I'm usually on my iPhone or kindle to pass my time away.  I usually do a #2 pedi, includes all the toe and callus goodies but the added bonus is a leg massage and hot rocks.    Mani's are great here too....I do the basic ones, but they do lots of fancy designs and nail and hand waxes.  Nail places are a dime a dozen, so if this salon keeps doing a good job I'll keep coming back.

I was new to the valley, and was desperate to find a new hair salon after months of bad color and cuts with the same stylist. I had been shopping at Ulta for a few months, and inquired about their salon and luck would have it, I met my hair guru, Nicole Puccetti. Nicole saved my hair! We worked on getting the color right( I must have had 10 different colors going on, on top of my head) and growing out my bad haircut. Nicole has years of experience and she KNOWS what she's doing. She cuts my husbands hair and our teenage kids' hair, and now she cuts my mother in laws hair too ( who by the way was getting her hair chopped at a low cost cutter...gasp!)   The salon is in the back of the store, so yes, people shopping in the back of the store walk by the salon, but it still feels pretty private. The employees in the store and salon are very nice and always say hello when you walk in. The store is bright and new and is always well stocked.

Please do yourself a favor and stay away! Have been going here for 2-1/2 years. Have never been REALLY happy, but location was convenient...last few times has made me cut the cord with these folks.  I bought a Groupon for three washes and their system for keeping track of remaining washes stink. They accused me of using all the washes up when I had two left. They made me feel like a thief.  This last time, an employee by the name of Josef, strong armed me into pre-buying a detail/upgrade and quoted me a price. When I went to pay, the price was inaccurate, and I told the cashier what I was quoted. She called Josef up front, and he was confrontational with me and walked behind me and said "you don't have to have such an attitude about it"! Cashier heard that and called manager....not much was done except for hearing that this was inappropriate behavior! Please!!!!  I've left this car wash with the crayon info left on the window, seats and mirrors in odd positions, bug stains not washed off and  lots of grease on the dash.  Josef is a rude employee, high pressure sales and just ok car cleaning.  Have been going to Cobblestone on Bell Rd in Surprise. A little out of the way, but a much better choice!

Pizza places are a dime a dozen in this neck of the woods..and having visited just about every one of them....I always come back to Barro's.  Yes, it may be because it's the closest to our house, but seriously, the pizza is always consistently good.   We usually order the traditional pie with all meat, cheese or pepperoni. The cheese is great on these pizzas, super fresh tasting and lots of it. I'm not a fan of over-sauced pizza, so that's probably why I like Barro's.  They put just the right amount on so you're not overwhelmed by the sauce, but you can still taste the toppings, the cheese and the delicious pizza dough.   If the four of us are eating for dinner, we order an extra large....enough for left overs for midnight snack or wrap it up for school lunches the next day.  Wings are great here too....They are meaty and juicy. Served with lots of wing sauce and ranch dressing. We only get the mild traditional, and they are barely spicy at all.  Convenient location to us, consistently good, great staff, competitive prices and clean restaurant. I'll keep coming back for more.

We have been eating at Barros on Lake Pleasant Parkway for 3-1/2 years. Since about September of 2014 it has been hit or miss. Bad customer service, errors with orders, pizza quality has gone down and the employees are loud and obnoxious in the dining area. We have given them chance after chance, but the last time we ate there, it took almost 20 minutes for a manager to correct an order problem, and then it never really got solved. Location is so great for us, but unfortunately these loyal patrons are going to have to move on.

Nope, not coming back....the only good thing I can say about this restaurant is they have good chips and salsa.  We were dying in our pants when my kids said we should have called the fire department when they brought the fajitas. So much smoke which eventually meant burnt chicken. The steak fajita was just ok, but the beef was chewy and hard to cut.    My daughter said the rice tasted like Mexican minute rice out of a box and my son said his enchilada tasted like hospital food. Jalapeño poppers, save the $6...cooked from frozen. Blech!  Really wanted to like this place....but it just wasn't happening. Left the restaurant pretty unamused that we spent $70 on food we didn't even box up to go. Bland food, overwhelmed staff and tired decor. Still wondering why we had to wait 30 minutes to be seated.

This ER is the best thing since sliced bread! We brought our 14 year old daughter in to the North Peoria ER on a Saturday afternoon when her cold turned into bronchitis. A simple phone call to find out if they accepted our insurance, a 3 minute drive, and we were in and out in 20 minutes. All of the staff and doctors were great in this almost brand new facility. It's the best kept secret all the way up here in the NW Valley!

Uh oh! We're back....this time it's our 21 year old with an ear infection, strep and running a fever! This emergency room is like heaven. No wait, the most efficient staff and the best doctors. Seriously, it's like having a personal medical team on call just for us....

Bestow my heart! Found out about this bakery at the farmers market ( Phoenix Public Market)....was so excited they were located only minutes from me in the west valley.   Mom and Pop came out from the bakery behind the counter to greet me...I wanted just bagels (by the way she gives you a bakers dozen) but I walked out with cinnamon popovers and a monkey bread loaf she modestly calls a white bread.   The loaf is amazing. Looks like a pull apart bread lightly crusty on the outside and light, fluffy deliciousness inside. It's so big it pops up high, right over the pan. I didn't even need butter....be careful though, this bread can be addictive and it's hard to put down! She has a jalapeño and a garlic variety, which I can tell you are crazy delicious.   I've had the cinnamon popovers which are to die for, and today she had chocolate chip popovers....which I passed on.   I was close to wiping her out of bagels...she has plain, everything, salt, garlic, poppy, sesame and a couple of others. Mom tells me she doesn't use preservatives, so everything is fresh and goes fast...come early.  The bagels are this close to tasting like a NY bagel and they freeze really well. Slight baked crunch on the outside, light and airy on the inside.  Mom and pop sells Boarshead meats/sandwiches and has a few other items on a short menu. She also had phyllo triangles stuffed with spinach and cheese along with other bakery items.  The restaurant area is cute and small, set up with a few tables and a soda machine refill station. Tucked in the back of a strip mall right off the 101 and Union Hills, a little hard to find the first time, but your radar will be on once you're ready to go back.

This restaurant has a love/hate relationship with its yelpers....wasn't sure what to expect....so we headed over with our Groupon in hand and....I loved it!   It's located in City North....a quiet ghost town/pseudo city scape, dotted with a handful of trendy bars and interesting restaurants...  When you walk into Modern Margarita, you feel like you're walking right into the patio. There isn't a bad seat in the house. Huge double sided bar is about 40% of the seating, then a few tables inside and the rest outside.   Great atmosphere on a Saturday afternoon, beautiful weather to be sitting outside...music wasn't loud at all...opposed to what I have read elsewhere, may have been time of day.   Service wasn't outstanding, but it was consistent and pretty good.   Started off with a Sonora Margarita...pretty strong, and my husband had a pomegranate cosmo, which I liked better...very refreshing.  We ordered the salsa trio and chips, free refills :) and an order of guac, which was yum! I really liked the green salsa and fresh pico de gallo...wasn't thrilled with the red salsa, had a lot of cumin, which I'm not a fan of.   For lunch I had the steak street tacos on flour tortillas which I really liked. Well marinated and tender steak with slices of avocado. Came with three street tacos which was plenty.   My husband had the chili burger with cheese and garlic fries. He said it was really good, and the beef was very tasty. He especially enjoyed the garlic fries.  The prices weren't that bad. I thought for the nice relaxed atmosphere, good food and service, the prices were spot on. The serving sizes aren't huge, but they are definitely sufficient to fill you up.  I enjoyed my lunch, really liked the atmosphere....next time we might try sitting at the bar for a different experience. Nice place, we'll be back!

Our doggies give their paws of approval!   My Bichon's love Jan, Owner at JJ's Mobile Grooming. That's why we have been happy to be using JJ's for 2-1/2 years and are completely satisfied with her work.   As requested, Jan does a puppy cut on the dogs, clips their nails and brushes their teeth. They come back smelling and looking great, and best of all they are happy dogs when they're all done (and it helps when she spoils them with doggie chocolate chip cookies ).  Our dogs have never been returned to us with a nick or cut, and they're groomed perfectly every time.   Jan genuinely loves her business and the dogs, and it shows in her work....I won't let anyone else groom our doggies!

"Come to mama" salsa verde....thick and spicy! Oh so good.   First time eating at this glorified Mexican food truck. We had the steak tacos, ordered as a flight, which came with a tapa, chips, salsa and a drink...all for $7.99.   We chose the chicken empanada for our tapa, which was good....served on shredded lettuce with a Mexican crema and a tasty chipotle mayo. Next time, I'm going to try the ham and cheese croquetas. They looked really good.  The steak taco was amazingly delish! The beef was well marinated and super tender. The flour tortilla was fresh and chewy, with a dry floury texture on the outside. Taco was served with lettuce, tomato, mancheca and guac. The tacos are small ( a little bigger than a street taco) but pared with a tapa, should be fine for lunch.   The green chips were delish. Not oily at all, fresh and crisp. We chose salsa verde, but there were about 4 or 5 other salsas to choose from. The green salsa was like nothing I've ever seen. I thought it was guac at first, because it's that thick. One small container just didn't seem enough for the big bag of chips.  We parked and walked up to their window, but In the summer, drive through is a must, because you bake in the outside seating. No inside seating available.  So glad after a year of saying I have to try this place, I finally did. Seems like it's always crowded, but line moves pretty quickly as do the orders. I sometimes see Groupons come up for this place, so keep an eye out.   We'll back very soon!

Came back after just a couple of days, it's that good :)  Got the croquetas this time. 6 small ham and cheese fried balls of deliciousness dipped in spicy sauce. Also had the cilantro lime rice....it's a winner!

It wouldn't be fair to compare to Katz's, Carnegie or Stage deli in NYC....but for Surprise AZ, the corned beef and pastrami are pretty good.    I ordered Corned beef and Pastrami at the counter to take home.  Service was soooo painfully slow, and waiting for the ticket to pay was even more painful. I had to ask for Challah and half sour pickles, because I didn't see any at the counter...I was told they were in the back.  Hmmmm?  If you want to sell something, people have to know you have it to sell.  With that being said, the meats were good. Sliced thin, very fresh and moist. Liked the pastrami better than the corned beef, but both were tasty.   Coleslaw was very good, and I piled that on my challah bread, to make a sandwich.  Challah was delish.  Very eggy, soft and light on the inside.  They sliced it for me, a bit thick, next time I will ask for it sliced thinner.  Potato knish, I have to say, was good too....A little different outside than I am used to, but tasty as well.  Filled with lots of onion and creamy potatoes.  They also have meat and veggie knish's.  My favorite, the half sour pickle.  Hard to come by around here, and you have to ask for them, because they are not in the deli case.  As a pickle aficionado, I can attest to this being a very good half sour!  For tomorrow morning, I got a small amount of nova lox cream cheese for my bagel ( which I buy elsewhere), and gotta tell you, that is one heck of a good cream cheese.   The restaurant is good sized and they have a nice shaded patio dining area too.  I don't know what the old place looked like, but this place is clean, large, lots of parking and was pretty crowded at lunch time on a Tuesday afternoon.   Next time I go, I'm trying the potato salad and picking up some chive cream cheese....maybe a blintz or two.

I love Oregano's! Love their food, service, ambiance and location. Would have given 5 stars if it wasn't for their infamous long wait time to be seated.  Oregano's....if you're listening, please take reservations or call ahead seating!!  There isn't anything on the menu that doesn't come out hot, fresh and delish! I'm hooked on their huge antipasto salad enough for 6 people. Fresh lettuce, lots of Italian meats, roasted peppers, onions, cheese, tomatoes and artichokes. Dressing is amazing! Pair it with garlic bread and it could be a meal.  Pizza....OMG. Thin crust, stuffed, plain or dressed with your favorite toppings...they are all winners.  Lasagna, to die for! Order of huge meatballs with marinara and cheese...can't be compared. Guacatoni....out if this world. Pasta....keep it coming. Wings, award winning! Garlic bread...will keep the vampires away!  Need I say more :)  Oh yes, I will say one more thing. If you leave with out ordering a chocolate chip pizza cookie for dessert, then you've missed out on the whole Oregano's experience. Order one with 4 spoons and everyone can get a piece of the pie...uhum, cookie!

First time eating at this location....their service and food is consistent with any other location I've eaten at.   We sat at the bar, avoiding a 45 minute wait for a table, on a Saturday night at 5:30! They have call ahead seating, but we decided to stop in last minute.  I like bar service myself, because there is someone there all the time, you never have to wait for a server to stop by.  Their infamous bread and cinnamon butter were gone in seconds....but a second helping would have been too much, because we ordered their crazy delicious fall of the bone ribs for an appetizer. Seriously, these ribs, no matter what, are hands down THE most delicious. I am not a fan of BBQ, but the sauce is toned down, smokey, not tangy.  I ordered the 6oz sirloin, medium rare, with a side Caesar salad and baked potato. Steak was amazing! Quality and taste are out if this world. My husband had the country fried sirloin steak with gravy, house salad and green beans. I wasn't a fan of his entree because it was fried and had gravy, but he said it was delish. The green beans were cooked with bacon..I did not like at all, but he finished the whole thing!  No dessert for us, because in all reality, their dessert menu is boring, but after all that food, who wants dessert anyway.  Atmosphere is super loud and the bar was a bit over the top with some heavy handed drinkers. I prefer the atmosphere at the Peoria location, but none the less, had a great time :)

Doc's caught our eye at the downtown Phoenix Public Market. Oh yummy luscious is his Piña Colada sorbet ( so smooth) and pineapple green tea gelato (super refreshing)! But what made my knees hit the ground, was the oh so decadent Tequila Sunrise :)   Lots and lots of creative flavors and quality ingredients and not to mention the nicest bunch of folks too!!   Unfortunately we are not close to him in Tempe...so hoping he is at the market when go there!

Amazing donuts!!! Location is hidden, but once you know they're here, you'll be coming back! First time here, so I tried a chocolate raised and my husband had a glazed raised. He said it was as good or better than Krispy Kreme! Mine was so light and fluffy...soooo fresh!
