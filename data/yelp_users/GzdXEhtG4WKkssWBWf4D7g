Horrible customer service. There are so many people working here and when you need their help, they aren't there to help and make you wait for them. I hate coming to walmart for this reason!

I find everything I need here for my son and the cool thing is every time I buy I get points so I get a lot of coupons

I've been to many starbucks locations but this one is my favorite right now. In the mornings it does get a lot of traffic and it does take longer to get to the window. But my coffee always tastes good. Anything I get always has the right flavors that I like. They do know how to make good coffee and the staff is really friendly

I ordered my wedding cake through Baker Wee. The cake was delicious, it looked gorgeous. It was a perfect cake but when it was delivered, our florist said there was a hole on the side of the cake so they had to take the flowers and move them to over the hole. I didn't notice anything looking at it from the front but once I saw the back I was able to see where the hole was. That's why I gave a 4 star eating BUT overall, I was pleased with the taste and the way it came out. Exactly how I wanted(other than the hole) I will definitely recommend them. My husband is very picky on cakes, and he loved the way it tasted also

I read some negative comments about this place, the burger being flavorless and small? Came here to shop and got hungry, the mall was closing and this place looked good. We got the Mo Burger. I split it with my sister, big mistake, it was so good and flavorful, we both wished we ordered a whole one. The size is good and the flavor was great! If our shopping and hungry, I say you stop here. I wish there was more locations, since I love north Scottsdale and closer to me. I will definitely be coming back!

First time here at this location and as soon as I walked in we felt welcomed. The staff is extremely friendly and they all greet you. The food is delicious. I'll definitely be back here!

It's a very unique place. Wasn't to fond at first with seeing all the dogs going in there but we were not close to sitting next to them, I have allergies with their hair so being next to some would be unpleasant for me. I would give it a 5 only if there was a different are where the dogs can stay and not so close to other people. The food was delicious tho!!
