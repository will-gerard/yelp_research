Love Flancers. Even better since they expanded. Food is great, service is friendly and prices are reasonable. Highly recommended.

If I could give Allegiant Airlines less than one star, I would but unfortunately that is as low as I can rate them. Our bad experience started last year when our kids were going to a camp in San Francisco. We show up on July 4th and they said the flight had been cancelled. My daughter said they waited in line and when they got there she said I want to check in for my flight to Oakland and he said good luck getting on a cancelled flight. Wow. I spent a long time on hold with them to get it resolved and they would not put them on another flight. We had to buy expensive flights to get them there on another airline and the best they wold do is give us a voucher. We are trying to use the voucher now as it is about to run out and it is not in our online account. I called, got on the phone and was on hold for 59:21. When the woman finally answered, she was rude and unhelpful. I told her we had been on the phone a long time and I asked her to take my number down and call us back if we got disconnected. She said our daughter had already used the flight. I said no, and she said well you will have to check on that. I asked her where she wanted me to check? WTH? Then she said can I place you on a brief hold...15 minutes later she disconnected me. How do you get through to this company to help you?

Texas Roadhouse is a great place to have a decent steak. It is affordable and the food is well prepared. The staff is friendly and you just have to know going in there will be some whoop and hollaring for birthdays and anniversaries. It is not a high-end steak house, if that is what you are looking for, this is not it...it is a simple, affordable and consistent chain restaurant. We enjoy it.

We love Pita Jungle. We eat at the Chandler location 2-3 times a week. My husband is a nurse and we live in Gilbert so he gets off work around 8 or 8:30...we went to Pita Jungle in Gilbert and it was 8:45 and they told us they were closed. I said, that it says 9 at the door and the manager said, we don't serve anyone this close to closing. This was about 2.5 years ago I think...it was when they first opened. We will drive all the way to Chandler now. Occasionally we will eat at Pita Gilbert in a pinch but the service is terrible there and they will have you wait even when there are empty tables sitting there...they don't hustle at all to please the customer. Their portions are smaller too. Not that I need a huge portion but we like to share our food and having more chicken in a spicy chicken wrap rather than rice filler makes a huge difference to me. Mostly, I like the food for the most part but the service is, has been and continues to be aweful. I am pretty certain it comes from the management.

I worked with Dustin at Solutions Real Estate. Although I am now with Realty One Group, I still visit with Dustin from time to time and stay in touch. He is a progressive REALTOR and is always looking for ways to support his client in getting more for their home faster. He is a great REALTOR that will support you when buying and selling.

This is a great place to sit and watch the city go by....the yogurt is to die for and the management rocks.

Loved this place. I take my car to the dealership over there and whenever I do, I make sure to have lunch there. Great food and great wine. ;)
