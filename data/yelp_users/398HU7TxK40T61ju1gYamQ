I hate cox... With a passion, they are rude and out source their customer service that we couldn't understand ANYTHING from the rep.   At the end of the day we got what we wanted but I had to go up to corporate level. Their sales reps are dishonest and will do anything for a sale

AMAZING PLACE! Great atmosphere, amazing food... The only thing I could complain about was the service. It was a Wednesday late after noon so not too busy and our waitress didn't come by much.  Other than that I would suggest the curry and carna ASADA dish and their fries!
