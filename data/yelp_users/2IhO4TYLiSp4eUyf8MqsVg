Food is good and the beer is cold. The staff is friendly and attentive. Defiantly a place to watch a game.

Got to one star this, the service was Terrible and the place wasn't even busy. I couldn't get the server to take a picture of our group.

This company changes there price on a weekly basis, never shows up on time, and have the worst  service Ever. I would rather pay a dollar more and use ice king!!! Trust me the dollar savings isn't worth your time!!!!
