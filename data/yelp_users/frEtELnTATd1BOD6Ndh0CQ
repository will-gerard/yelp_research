I have worked near this place for 8 years now. I have eaten at every single lunch food place surrounding this office at least once. My favorite is Ichi Ban.  I just can't afford it as often as I want.  I have also eaten sushi at several valley locations and I return to Ichi Ban every time. Why? Becuase they make the rolls very tight. The rice is perfect and the flavor is fresh. I can't stand it when rolls are sloppy and the rice falls apart or the fish slides right off. The portions of fish per piece is just right and the flavors blend so nicely. The presentations look good, especially that Dec. 29th roll. I have never had the fish smell I've encountered in other joints. Even the octopus is fresh and the wasabi is hot.   Their tempura is perfect, the gyoza make it possible to bring my child who isn't as adventurous. I have never gotten sick there. I have frequently gotten full. I agree they are too attentive on the drink orders and seem to be in a hurry to take away your miso bowl, which is partly why they lose a star. Let a person eat!  The other reason was when I ordered my daughter some lemonade I got Endamame. I realize they may sound similar, but it was a drink order. They had good endamame though so I was ok. The third reason is that they close between late lunch and early dinner and it makes it less likely for me to go across the street to eat for dinner when I have to wait an hour.  When I first visited the place was so dark and narrow, but I liked sitting up at the sushi bar and the owner remembers you. Well he always remembers me and even what we like and asks about my daughter when we don't bring her. I don't like their green tea ice cream, it tastes like what I expect Cyndi Lauper's lipstick might taste like. Maybe it's supposed to taste that way and I don't like anyone's green tea ice cream. I haven't tried others since that experience. I'd rather spend my money on another roll. I have tried to get my co-workers to come over, but no one I work with cares for sushi. I told them they could get a rice bowl with teriyaki chicken or something, but they pass. Maybe they don't want to go to lunch with me... hmm.   My partner told me that not all Ichi Ban's are created equal. I'm just lucky this one is so close.  I just wish I could afford more of it. I'd eat there every day.

(UPDATE 1/09 ~ Things from the following review have been fixed at this location and it is once again on my rotation and has become a happy place. 4 stars!)  My happy place just pissed me off. I spoke to the owner though, so I hope something changes. Apparently they have some new staff people who have no clue how to treat customers. They were rude to me, annoying, grabby and basically ruined my lunch hour, to the point where I left the joint.   Secondly, the sushi rice was not as good as I am accustomed to from them and I don't know why they would mess with it. They haven't given me fruit at the end of my meal in a long time and with the annoyance I have had twice now with the service they just dropped down on my rotation.  It's only because of closeness that they will get another shot, but after 8 years of loving this place I am very sad to see it in this condition. The sushi still tastes good, but as I said they did something weird with the rice recently.

We eat here a lot and I realized I haven't put a review in of this place. This is hands down one of the yummiest offerings at the Chinese Cultural Center. We've been to all the places in this complex, but for repeatable quality, good prices, and service, this is the best one. The servings are (IMO) three per entree. So when you go and you traditionally think one entree per person be warned! Expect to share. The hot and spicy soup is consistently one of the best in Phoenix. The Pork buns perfect, the best General Tao's I've been able to find, and large scallop and shrimp in the meals that feature them. I have not found a meal here that I regret ordering. The kitchen will work with you if you have special requests and they will not leave your drinks languishing. After approximately 20 visits, they have never gotten an order or a bill wrong.  The place doesn't have many people eating in it when I've gone usually Chinese people though. Once in awhile the place is quite full, but the best news is they are open EVERY DAY until 9:30. They are not upset when you arrive close to 9pm. Szechuan cooking is quite delightful here and I'll pick it over closer options any day of the week. I'm sorry I haven't Yelped them. They have been around for 10 years in this location and you should give them a try, especially if you are headed over to Ranch Market afterwards. I don't think you'll be disappointed.

The interior decor is nicer than the strip mall suggests. This seems to be true in Arizona a lot. The special that evening was Cajun shrimp with Anchovy Sauce, but I wasn't in the mood for those flavors as I was eating a bit early. This was to be a light meal.  I ordered the clams in broth. 20 clams in a nice bowl, but the broth was very heavy on black pepper. I would have preferred, buttery or white wine or other flavors, but there were only green scallions to fight for dominance. The clams were ok, but some were gritty. I ordered a spicy salmon roll and that was very good. I liked the roe on the outside of the roll and the roll stayed intact as I brought it to my mouth. My partner got the Ahi with glaze and it was prepared perfectly, although the glaze was heavy handed. The tea was nice. My Raspberry Spritzer had a flavor I couldn't determine and I didn't like it as much as I thought I would. I actually added water to it, to soften the flavor and that's not something I've done often anywhere. The dessert case didn't have all the selections, but from my partners perspective the cheesecake looked nice, but when it was delivered it looked like the flan selection. oops. That tall white thing we saw was a vanilla cake, not the cheesecake. The actual cheesecake was shrunken and covered with a light brown sauce. I tolerated only one bite, it was dry, it was old and it was sour tasting, and we just left it on the table. Yuck.   Despite the 2 stars this visit we will likely return. I think there are better things on the menu and more things to try.  I won't bother with desserts of fancy drinks next time.

Was I crazy taking my car to a self admitted Madman?  Would I regret sitting down at this tea party?   Would the Time is takes to complete the car work be affected by mustard on the guy's watch?  Is the Queen correct, should he be beheaded?  The answer to all of these is NO!  1 star for getting a friendly, calm voice, telling me their hours and to bring it in whenever I wished, first come first serve and meaning it. No push one for English, no confusing bumbling appointment scheduler, no leaving my car there overnight, handing out my key so they can get to it "sometime."   1 star for putting my car up on the lift right away and describing each of the sections that required repair and why, showing me the parts in advance; breaking down the quoted repair before beginning any maintenance. No surprises, total professionals.  1 star for completing the repair in 45 minutes, same day with all new parts, full warranty. Drove away after spending less time than it takes to get a lunch.  1 star for adjusting the muffler the next day with no appointment required or cost when we detected a rattle. Great handshake and pleasant quick attention. Took less than 5 minutes!  1 star for contributing to the community a portion of proceeds to help veterans and schools.  For a grand total of perfect 5 stars. This is obviously the complete madness they refer to in the name. Compared to the usual run around you get with shady car repair places, this was insane in a good way.  If you need work done on your car exhaust and you don't know who to trust or go to, take my word for it, go to Mad Hatter. It was painless and the cost was half of what I expected from another shop or dealer.   They will be our go to repair place for these needs from now on.

Our car failed emissions three times. DOh!  Finally we determined that we needed a new catalytic converter. I called Mad Hatter at 12:10 on a Saturday. They said they close at one pm, but if we got there quick they could do what we needed. They gave us a price quote.  We arrived at 12:20. They installed a new catalytic converter, we paid the quoted amount. We left at 12:40.   How's that for all done, no fuss no muss?   We passed our emissions test with flying colors.   GOLD. Honest, fast, wonderful service! We love this Mad Hatter location!

Chevy's five years ago was crisp and fresh and the salsa was great. The tortillas were hot and fresh and the staff engaging. It was a lovely place to have fun. Then it took a nose dive in every single area and it didn't seem to care. Quality and service and food, man we had some nasty times and stopped visiting. We thought fresh my ***. If you had made a suggestion of going to Chevy's I would roll my eyes. Thanks but no thanks.  On a lark, maybe desperation, we went back this weekend. They have updated the menu, the staff, the service and the place is back functioning again. I asked management what happened and they divulged the handling of parent company Pepsi was a disaster for the Chevy's branding and they have been sold to new people. It shows.  If you used to enjoy Chevy's and then over the past few years stopped, then it's time to go back. The fire shrimp is back, the service is back, the machino is working and things remind me of when I first tried them out. We were full, and satisfied. If you have any issues with your new experience they are listening now. Welcome Back Chevy's.

I've passed by this place, ignoring it on several occasions. It's awfully hard to see scrunched into the corner of the strip mall and it doesn't draw you in with it's signage. I've seen it's poorly designed website and it's lack of reviews by people. Most of the time when I've glanced over I haven't seen anyone eating there either, so I shrugged it off. What a loss to me! It was a Friday night and I was craving lamb so I cajoled my partner to at least go look at the prices posted on the door. Walking over to it I was drawn to the outside babbling fountain and greenery, simple, calming. They nodded form the door that the prices were within tolerance and we could head in. The seating area was light and elegant, folded napkins, music playing soft ballads. The mirrored area seemed to make such a tiny place truly expand, but we were comfortable not squeezed in. The proprietor, Frank was smiling and came over immediately. A lovely welcome, a drop of menus, a discussion of drinks. He showed my daughter how to make a folding napkin shape and asked some personal questions, but he spoke to us individually, including my child.  He took stock of us and volunteered his insight outloud, that we seemed to be happy, good people. While it would have seemed strange and disconcerting in many venues for some reason it didn't feel intrusive here. It was ... pleasant. We chose hot teas and enjoyed having a broader selection than in most places and he left the whole box right at the table in case we wanted others.  We selected the Greek Combo appetizer with spanikopita, dolmodes and pita with tzaziki. It was simple fare, but a good indicator of the pita quality we would see later ~ fresh, not greasy. The dolmades were wrapped tight and flavorful. The grape leaves were properly seasoned so they just melted in your mouth. They were the best dolmades I have ever had. It did what an appetizer should do though and we got excited for the next foods to come.  I knew immediately that I was going to order lamb, but I wasn't sure which way. I ended up selecting the shank because the restaurant said it was their specialty, my child ordered the Keftedes appetizer as her main meal, and my partner the gyro platter. When the meals came everything was plated nicely. The keftedes were resting beneath a beautiful bechamel sauce that wasn't skimped on at all surrounded by more pita triangles.  I had to steal one of her greek meatballs to cut in half and share with my partner. These were juicy and perfectly browned, no grease, no burned edges, no dryness. The texture was smooth and we were very impressed. But would the meatball connoisseur be happy? My talkative daughter didn't interrupt us so much as she was busy saying mmmm and yum and mmmm again. Smiling. Spooning some of the sauce onto the pitas when my daughter got full, was an added treat for the grown-ups. My lamb shank was perfection, in seasoning, in cooking, even the bone marrow required sucking out. While the rice was nice and the kernals moist and fluffed, I didn't find any seasoning to it really. I'm not sure if that's traditional, but I liked it for it's simplicity against the lambs more savory parts.  My partners Gyro platter, was as standard as could be, but the serving was large, the rice was the same as mine. For them the real standout was the Pita itself which was fresh, warmed and easily folded into a it's implied role. We'd been to so many places where the pita's were terrible that I think we were extra happy about this. Although I think they were wistfully wishing for keftedes of their own. Dessert was definately an option when I saw the chocolate mousse cake. I've been hunting for a mousse cake done right for awhile now. So many times these mousses disappoint me. This one came chilled and smooth drizzled with chocolate sauce, but not buried in it.. It had a fine layer of mocha, which normally my daughter would balk at, but she couldn't get enough. I would be happy coming here for some coffee and mousse cake alone! I think I found a new source of joy. Fortunately other patrons came in and we got to see presentations of the the saganaki appetizer, baked kasseri cheese flamed with brandy and the seafood entree's which I must return to try. I noticed that Frank was equally personable with them and when he left the room the lady gushed over their food and whispered across to me, "Why is this place so empty, it's fabulous!"  Why indeed? Give this place a shot if you're nearby.

Rock Bottom continues to earn it's name. I have been to this location on 5 separate occasions because my partner likes the beer varieties and the Pretzels. He has stopped telling me we are headed here because I will get them to change their mind before we arrive. After this last visit I told them that there are no more redeeming factors for me at this restaurant and I am not returning.  Chicken Oscar ~ belongs right in the trash with its muppet fur of shredded canned crab meat stuffed inside. Special of the night? It was a disaster and took forever to prepare. When I got it the chicken was dry and burnt all on the bottom. I could easily split the chicken open and see that the stuffing was a light smear of obvious canned shredded clam. The asparagus was hard and over buttered and the mashed potatoes were heavy and uninspired. It took so long and I couldn't get the waitstaff attention to bother returning it or thinking of more food to try.  My partner had a burger, it was nothing special. The good part of that meal were the kettle chips, really! They were awesome. We enjoyed our pretzels very much. We didn't stay for dessert, we've had problems with three of their desserts in the past and we weren't going to try them again. Service and wait staff were slow and uninterested, it's July and it must suck to work there with it mostly empty, I know servers make crap, so I left a fair tip, but I'm done.   In this economic climate, either get good at what you do or go away. There are better places to eat. Tons of them.

My family went to Ted's this weekend. We have been avoiding it because we dislike cash only establishments, unfortunately we can now avoid it because we don't much care for Ted's.   I am from Upstate NY and I definately want to support bringing culturally pleasing (to me) food out to the desert. Knowing Ted's is from "back home" (since 1929), this encouraged me to break with our no cash only policy, besides I had to know if their hot dogs were better than the ones I import from Rochester to Arizona a few times a  year. It's expensive to bring Zweigles (since 1880) to Arizona and if there is a local replacement I was ready to find out.  First the ordering of our food was confusing. The person on the grill heard the first two items and then started talking to others in line to take their orders and I wasn't done yet. It wasn't like I paused, it was like he just heard all he wanted from me and moved on. I had to interrupt the ordering going on after me and say, Hey! I'm not done yet. This annoyed him, obviously. But I couldn't believe it when I started to order the rest, It didn't seem like he was paying any attention becuase mid sentance he started talking cheese with the people in front of me!  Ahem... we need two white hots, two footlongs, two corn dogs, three medium logenberry's, a chocolate shake and an onion ring please...  Next thing I know we are at the condiment section and the guy is putting stuff on my dogs I haven't even told him yet what I want on them!  Excuse me, I want to put Weber's mustard on that white hot. The grill guy yells over to me, "We don't use Weber's, if you don't want yellow you can pump out the spicy mustard over by the straw station."   They don't use the mustard they are advertising in the window? They don't have the spicy mustard at their own condiment station? In the meantime the register girl has already totalled my order and my order hasn't even been made yet, so of course it's not correct. I said, it's not all here yet. This puzzled her. I said I am still waiitng for the corn dogs, the drinks , the onion rings and the chocolate shake. She started over and came up with a second total, also wrong. The shake came in a tiny size, they said they are one size only. Who knew.  The register girl screwed up the change as well. Good thing I didn't just swipe a card and get screwed not paying attention.  We got to the table determined to see if the food was worth the aggravation. Since the toppings were not done right and the onion rings were very undercooked and a gnarled mess I was really hoping the white hot dogs flavor would kick ass. This was my main reason for coming. It was a decent dog, but it was not better than the ones I have shipped in to my house.  Amazingly enough the best tasting of the dogs we bought were the corndogs! What a surprise. But not worth driving out to Ted's and having cash ready for them. As for the shake, it rivaled McDonalds to me and I'd be happier getting a mondo size Chocolate Peanut Butter delight from Lenny's.  So for atmosphere, service, food and cost it just doesn't rate more than the two stars I gave it. Looks like I haven't found a way to replace my multi year shipment for back east brats, dogs, etc. with a local alternative. Sorry Ted's.

Elephant Bar?  Our 10 year old chose it for her reward dinner. She loved the decor , it was reminiscent of a blend between Rainforest Cafe and Cheesecake Factory. I bet the decor alone made the place expensive to start up, but the only thing that is going to keep it and it's other locations open is the indifference in the palate's of it's dining customers.   It was our first visit, she had been once before and any 10 year old can be enchanted by a huge elephant and a brass giraffe and fans. The menu for most kids is the same everywhere, hot dog, corn dog, mac and cheese, burger, chicken tenders. So why not eat it in a funky enviroment, right?  We ordered the Ahi Tuna Appetizer and three fountain drinks. Fortunately we put that in right away, because the preparing of food here was very slow. The Ahi was actually the best part, I wish there had been more of it. The salad they rested it on however was so-so, something tasted off about it and the strange ginger-like dressing was, well.. strange. We ignored it after a taste.  I ordered Macadamia encrusted fish, my partner a Shrimp special from Chef Reinhold and we let the daughter pick a grown up dinner, half rack of St. Louis ribs. My fish was actually fish sticks and they didn't sub in the sweet potato fries as requested. Since the fish sticks were burnt, I immediately had them returned to the kitchen for a new set. My daughters ribs were quite dry, but she seemed to like them. Not so much the cole slaw or the apples or the fries that came with. It was a good thing she had a late lunch and wasn't very hungry. My partners food was ok, but uninspiring. The bowl of rice and veggies is kind of hard to screw up.  I was given two of their coconut shrimp while I waited for a return entree.  Then the restaurant decided they should give me something to eat while I waited.  They asked if I would accept a house salad and I said, sure, with blue cheese. I received such a watered down version I almost swore it was a poor ranch, but it was something to eat and it helped pass the time.  Everyone had finsihed by the time I got my entree. When the second entree came, some sticks were still darker than I'd like, but it wasn't worth sending it back. The dipping sauces provided for them were disgusting. There was a green pesto like sauce that didn't match fish at all and there was a sweet and tangy sauce overdone with citrus, cloyingly sweet. I ended up using the soy from my partners platter, it was the most palatable. Maybe a tartar or peanut sauce or even a hot sauce would have been better. The coleslaw was mediocre and not worth the calories, the fries ok, but I was dissatisfied.  We also ordered a dessert, daughters choice and she pretty near ate the whole thing herself as dinner was light for all of us.  I almost gave this place three stars, because they took the fish stick disaster off the bill, they tried to make things nice with a salad, the server was doing his best with a kitchen that wasn't making it easy, but the truth is I won't return. My review score should reflect that I don't  think you should visit either, hoping for a better time. I think you'd be sorry about it.  I hope my two star review will help convey the warning that It's just not good enough food and even with the removed entree, no alcohol, we still paid over $50.  There is a lot of selection nearby at this price range, don't get sucked into the decor or unique name. Rename this place "Elephant Barred."

Prime was not.  It was not yummy. It was not inexpensive. It did not refill soda drinks. It had no other customers.  The lady who met us at the front was expecting us to get take out. Why? There were plenty of tables and it was clean.   We stayed, we ordered Hot Thai Soup, House chicken, House seafood, lemonade, soda and Thai tea with cream. The rice was a very small portion, the seafood was inedible, because the garlic sauce was like mucus and tasted off, not worth $16 for sure!  The chicken was like it had sat on a buffet for hours and I'm not sure what they made the sauce out of, it wasn't to our liking. The soup tasted of mustard not lemongrass and chili or coconut or what you might expect from a Thai hot soup. Thai Rama, Malee's...others have better soup.  I expected a lot better from the reviews. I understand why it's empty now and I'm surprised it's been here so long. It's only because they handled the order fine, service was fine and the place is clean that they got 2 stars.   I would not try them again for food, unless i got really desperate and too lazy to drive farther than their location which is really close to home. I'll probably try the China Buffett down the street before I return to Prime. Very disappointing.

The absolutely WORST place I have ever been inside and forced myself to eat at. I will never go inside this filthy, dilapadated building whose letters don't  light up again. We were very limited on time and daughter wanted a buffet real bad, so we went.   I walked around the tables in absolute horror, struggling to find just one item that didn't look completely sickening. I watched a worker remove a stew like concoction that looked like it had been sitting out for 5 hours plus... it  was dried out and clumpy. I thought GREAT, getting somethign fresh... but no...he replaced it with a basin of beefy broth and floating carrots;  then proceeded to scoop the dried out stew clumps into the new hot broth and reconstitue it. SO GROSS.  I chose three chicken chunk items. all cold, all grisley all nasty. There was a huge sign warning people not to take more than they will eat, to please not waste the food. Did they ever consider maybe people took a small portion of things to try and just couldn't eat any of it, it was so foul?   Who calls three colors of Jello sitting on ice a dessert buffet?  DONE. And Never Ever again. Let this be your warning.

Oh my, I truly hate to do this, but my visit to Da Vang was horrid! After reading all the lovely reviews I was so excited to take my husband and child to a place near our new digs, to prove that we hadn't moved far away from good food experiences. We knew that the outside was a strip mall locale, we don't care. We knew the inside was going to look like it did, we don't care. We go to places because of food, service and price.   When we went they were working on the one entrance so we entered on the far side. There were two people eating and a few children running about playing. My first thought was great, this is a friendly, family place and light crowd would mean attentive service. We didn't know if we should seat ourselves, so we walked to the silverware table where we saw menu's and stood for a moment.  Three times servers walked right past us and ignored our presence. Other workers were in the kitchen area, but no one noticed us.   I whispered, "Maybe we should get menus and just sit down?" So we took three menu's and as I turned around one of the servers came up and made motion for us to sit right there at this huge circle table.  A very large table, but we slid into the corner and he took drink orders from us then dissappeared.  We sat. We sat some more. He walked by twice carrying water. Another server walked by twice, once with food, once with dishes. They greeted two more tables and brought them menus and took their orders. A server came and poured three water glasses for our table and I interrupted him asking about our drink order. He said something I didn't understand and turned away.  We sat.   Finally I said, "Excuse me, please..." I got the attention of a different server and we asked about our drink order which he took again and we didn't want to wait any longer and gave our food order as well. Just in case they'd never come back. I told the server we were new to this cuisine and would need some help. My husband just wanted to leave. I coerced him to stay, it's going to be fabulous Pho I said remembering the wonderful Yelp reviews. The food would soothe him. I smiled smugly. We ordered several dishes all recommended in Yelp reviews. Spring rolls, two Pho's and the Ban Xeo for my egg and shrimp loving child.  15 minutes later two drinks and some plates of leaves and garnishes were placed on the table. No drink for me and no way to get the garnish plate persons attention. We sat. "Are we supposed to eat these," asked my husband?  I said , "I believe they go in the soup when it comes." But after another 15 minutes of nothing else arriving, he started to make a mini salad. Several more tables had come in, everyone else had their food. The two tables who came after us were finishing up.  "This is Bullshit, " I muttered to my husband, and just then the crepe and the Pho's came out. I was starting to see a trend here. Just when you get to the point where you want to leave they finally do something to make you stay. We were starving and we didn't want to drive around for another place, just eat and go at this point. It was getting late. I hadn't eaten my garnishes so I shared them with my husband. My daughter's crepe was extra crispy bordering on too dark and she didn't know how to eat it, so she sort of plucked the little shrimps she found out of it.  "It's not egg mom", she said all grumbly. "It's Vietmanese egg I said, " as if I knew.   "Well then I don't like Vietmanese food." Sigh. Maybe she would like and try the spring roll? Or some of my soup? The sping roll, one nibble. She didn't appreciate it, which was ok with me becuase I loved them.My husbands Pho was full of fatty gristle meat and he w/couldn't eat any of it.  My Pho was wonderful! My garnishes made it very tasty.   So I fed my daughter some Pho, but she wasn't too fond of that either.  The only real consolation was the price. It cost about $25 for everything we got and everything we didn't.  Maybe I can get someone from Yelp who loves Da Vang to come with us next time and show us how the experience is SUPPOSED to be, becuase I can't imagine this is what people are raving over. Sorry. They get two stars for having a low price and food *I* liked, but I can't give them any more than that.

You have gotta be kidding me reviewers!  This place was neither tasty or satisfying, It wasn't cost effective, it wasn't great service. It wasn't even good food.  Let's start with the salsa. There is nothing chunky or spicy or fresh about it, It is sweet tomato sauce with a bit of onion in it. If this is salsa Ragu missed the boat by -this- much. It is most certainly not prepared there and is the absolutely worst salsa I have ever been served. I took one dip and I asked the waitress if they had any other types of salsa available. She said no. My partner said "it sort of grows on you," so I dipped a few more times and all that grew on me were questions as to how a Mexican restaurant was calling this salsa. I was considering an exit strategy, but we decided to let the food determine our visit.  Looking around the place, it was near empty, except for a large family table, a senior age couple and another couple our age who were also visiting for the first time. I know because they were asking all the questions I had about the menu. Interesting layout allows you to watch the cooks plate up the food. This can either be a great experience or a fearful one. Good lord how many onions are being put on the sizzling plate? What is being poured out of a deep frying basket over them? I don't think this bodes well.  I ordered the half pound Beef Fajita. My sizzling experience was that of two cups of undercooked white onion, one ring of green pepper and a tiny ring of red pepper. Sliced Fajita meat that was charred and chewy perhaps dropped in the fryer? Tortillas which were completely uneven in thickness and sizes (I guess that means they are homemade, right?) They were almost too cold to fold and were damp from being steamed warm I think. EW. Still I was hungry and going to make this work. My condiment plates shredded cheese was fused together as if someone had scooped it partially melted with an ice cream scoop. The sour cream was plentiful but warm. I desperately wanted to add the chopped tomatoes to the salsa bowl, it seems they belonged there, but there were only enough of them for one Fajita so I didn't. The only way I was going to get these fajitas to be remotely tasty was request some lime. Fortunately I was able to secure some juicy wedges which helped. My partner said they liked the beef jerky meat, but it's not what I had in mind. At all. That's ok, the border dinner was sure to please them, right?  NO. It should have been left at the border and denied entry into the states. The congealed enchiladas held the fork in an upright position and refused to be edible. The charro beans were only edible if you pierced the plastic shell of dried beans on top and dug out some bite from the middle. My partner who loves rice didn't even scoop a bite of the spanish rice a roni provided. The dinner salad was a wilted ranch dressing mess and was useful only to put on one of my fajitas. I thought it would add some crunch. It didn't. We stared at the fried tortilla cup that held the queso. Under the skin the cheese heart was beating. Seriously, it wanted to live! It would shudder periodically as if something was swimming beneath the surface. Heat, I imagine, is all that made it percolate, but we had reached a stage in this dinner where we knew it was a bust and everything became fodder for jokes.  I am never going back and I thought others should know that Outback and Lone Star are in the same vicinity. Make a better choice.  $33 dollars.   Wasn't it 33 pieces of silver that betrayed Jesus? These positive reviews were a Judas kiss, folks.

Gluttony is considered one of the seven deadly sins--Pope Innocent XI said "it is a defect to eat, like beasts, through the sole motive of sensual gratification, and without any reasonable object." Well, I'm a-goin' to hell, should that place exist, because a night at Fogo E Brasa is beyond redemption. I didn't just eat like a beast I ate several beasts. We had meats of such tender quality and savory succulence that I felt like Templeton in Charlotte's web, this is a place one can glut, glut glut glut!!!   Tri-tip, garlic sirloin, prime rib, pork loin, ham, chicken regular, chicken BBQ, turkey wrapped with bacon, sausage, lamb, beef kabob, top sirloin, roast beef, cooked pineapple of sweetness were all selections that flowed from the kitchen. On the table was rice and beans and fried bananas, vinegared vegetables and a wheat germ like powder. The salad bar provided stuffed calamari, chicken cacciatore, seafood salads, mussels, octopus, shrimp, crab,  hummus, mint tabouli, salad items not consistent with Sweet Tomatoes.  I am frequently dissappointed with the salad bar despite it's abundance. A lady wandered by with rice balls and Phyllo filled spinach pockets. Your vegetarian friend will probably not be able to get enough variety to make it worth dropping $31 bucks just to pick at the salad bar, becuase most things are still  meat/fish options, but if they know ahead of time, they can decide for themselves. It will be hard if they really can't stand the meat on skewers. It's a carnivore wet dream though. The $31 per person. does not include your drinks or your dessert. Plan accordingly.   The wine selections are also unique, so if you enjoy testing out bottles you might find an off the beaten path selection here. We stick to some Pelligrino water, go light on the salad bar and take our time sampling the skewered swords of savory sirloins. Sometimes you get a dryer piece, a piece too rare, or a piece with too much fat, simply cut it off and await more, this is unlimited. They will come around again. If you don't see your favorite you should have a person helping expedite your tables  who will ask what would you like to have come out next. This is a useful man! He made sure we got a fresh pineapple instead of a near the core and colder slice. He made sure a fresh lamb was brought out and some top sirloin that we almost missed completely. He was unobtrusive and made sure our drinks were taken care of as well.   When it came time for dessert, we knew to save enough space to share the Brazilian Chocolate mousse. It is thick and decadent. This experience is generally saved for a special treat, easy to drop a hundred bucks for two people if you have it all. You may find it necessary to make a reservation, especially if you are bringing a large group. As a couple we have always been seated within 15 minutes, even on a Saturday night. Enjoy!

Fenix is trying to ressurect itself during the flames of Summer heat in Arizona. We had read a menu of theirs online and were shaking our heads at the hodgepodge of options wondering what the main focus of this place was? Frankly the lack of focus kept us away. However one day we couldn't focus as diners and thought, "Hey we'll go to hodgepodge and there will be something we'll want." So we arrived at Fenix and as we were walking to the door noticed "WE NOW HAVE SUSHI." Oh dear, I thought they've added another specialty.   Inside the place was empty. The waitress greeted us politely and asked if we'd been here before. We hadn't. She said "Well we have a new menu, so there are some items not in stock." Not in stock were Rock Shrimp or Scallops. We would deal because we assumed there were plenty of other things. There weren't. The new menu was vastly simplified, a good thing, but the best items weren't available. The chef still listed specials from the old menu up on the chalk board. One of those items was not available. Is it too much to ask they erase the chalkboard if something is not available? A little frustrated we decided on the Maryland Crab Cakes and the Ribeye (there weren't any other steaks options or salmon or veal which had tempted me in Nadia's review) Unfortunately, after ordering we were informed they were also out of Maryland Crab Cakes. Stars are dropping here already and we didn't even have food. So we got Shrimp Tempura and Coq a vin and ordered a Yellowtail Sashimi.  Technically, the kitchen chef knows how to prepare dishes, but missing in every item was passion. No flair or sizzle, no substance, nothing to make the dish stand out and a few things to detract from the final product . Poorer quality base product seemed to be the culprit. Older mushrooms, frozen pearl onions, the wine in the coq a vin, the ribeye cut. the not fresh vegetables. Again things were textbook correct  but the base ingredients seems poor quality which was bringing down the final results of the dish, but the cost was for high end. The largest exception was the rolls, they were quite nice, hot tasty, sumptious rolls with sesame seeds.  It seemed like the chef had been a Culinary Arts Institute graduate trying to run a restaurant. We were curious so we asked about his background. Tanzanian, worked in NY and London, ran some other places in the area, no names provided for anyplace. Hm. Really? In the case of the sashimi, things were reversed. the sushi chef was not technically skilled based on how they cut the sashimi up and down instead, but the fish was fresh. Very limited sushi selection, but fresh as I could tell. Then we asked for dessert. No menu, but she offered three items two of which she couldn't pronouce. The last one she said was like a chocolate Mousse. Deal! But it wasn't a chocolate mousse. It was two chocolate covered creampuffs.  This place has potential, maybe they will get their sea-legs soon and stock the items on their menu. We'll need to return when we can afford to and see if they have good rock shrimp or scallops or crabcakes... or more customers. It was a nice enviroment. I wanted to give them more stars, as they are trying new things and people should give them a try, but they couldn't deliver the higher stars on our visit.

Haus Murphy serves up a quintessential German experience. An authentic feeling enviroment with a selection of foods that not only a native could love, but anyone willing to step into a Black Forest story book will find tasty.  Despite it's Central Glendale location the place wasn't heavily patronized on our Friday night visit, still we had called ahead as suggested and set a reservation time. We were seated immediately, but were forgotten for almost a half hour. I  didn't realize how long we were sitting until my partner pulled out the cell phone to check. I was looking over the decor and commenting on the trinkets and chatting.When our server came to take our order they were profusely sorry and immediately put a large bread pudding on our food list, either to take home or eat at the end of our meal, whichever we wanted as an apology.   From that moment on there wasn't a lack of attentiveness at all. The first two things that came were a Filet Salad and a Sausage appetizer. The salad was divine! Here is the description straight from their menu:  "Slices of Filet Mignon, Radish Sprouts, Marinated Artichokes, Asparagus, Green Olives, Roasted Red Peppers, fresh Spring Mix, tossed in Lavender Vinaigrette, topped with quenelle of Herbed Goat Cheese...."  That's right, drift off with me....to that lovely description. The Olives were not oily, they were fat, plump, martini olives. The Filet was perfect.  A Lavender Vinaigrette? It was a WOW. But it's a limited time salad, so it may not be there when you visit.  Then came the sausage sampler. You no longer can choose the sausages you sample like the online menu states, and you get saurkraut not german fried potatoes, but it was still nice. They set a bottled mustard you can buy in any grocery store on the table.  I think it  would have been nice to have some sampling of german mustards for dipping. It was at this point that I noticed we didn't have a bread basket. I had read about Rye and Pumpernickle with a tapenade that comes at the beginning, so I inquired. Unfortunately this was a cost loser for the restaurant and they no longer do it. Instead they brought out three basic dinner rolls with the tapenade instead. This change dissapointed me as it's rare to get hearty breads and the tapenade doesn't go well on a basic dinner roll, they should just bring out some butter.  On to the dinners. It was so very hard to choose among the Schnitzles and Sausages, but we managed. One Nurn-burger Combo and a Schweizer Schnitzle later with a side of potatoe dumpling and we were quite sure we'd ordered plenty of food. The Tomato soup which prefaced our entree's was better than I expected. Neither of us like Tomato soup and both of us liked this one. I'd skip the potato dumpling side in the future it was a gooey mass of starch,  maybe we should have tried the Spaetzle instead.   The Schnitzle was really good and the sausages juicy. I think I could try a different schnitzle each visit and be pleased. I also might consider just a sausage and a bun. They will bring a roll for your sausage if you ask. The Wirsing was very tasty, I had read it wasn't so good, but I was thrilled with it. In the end we were quite full, we had ordered some drinks and had forgotten the large promised bread pudding. It arrived and we ate what we could handle while the Tuba and Accordian duo played their way through the restaurant.   A bit spendy, we hit $80 for the two of us, but we weren't trying to eat cheap. Careful planning could lower the cost. All in all it was quite festive and fun for an evening and we are glad we went. You should visit!

I need to confirm that the Cornish Pasty Company is a pocket of heavenly yum yum. My husband got himself a peppered steak, I grabbed a salmon asparagus pocket and my daughter snagged a meats and cheese version. Expect to sit alongside your mates and clip your bag to the bar as the place is truly tiny. Husband also got a light ale.  Right away they wanted to take the order, but the menu is a fun adventure and as a first visit I really wanted to read all the selections. My family was starving so they just couldn't wait for me to meander over the varieties and the waitress was really eager to get moving. She said take your time, but she stood right there and so, I did feel a bit rushed. As a result I didn't order a side salad which I think would have made me happier. I was wondering if the Pasty was going to be enough, was it going to be soggy or burnt, was the crust going to be doughy or dry?  I mean I'm naturally a skeptical critic, why else would I Yelp? But my Pasty was perfect. It was not greasy, it was flaky but firm in the right parts, it wasn't burnt anywhere it was divine. My Pasty was not chock full of air pockets it was chock full of filling. My daughter could only eat half (she's 9) but the adults were perfectly satisfied without being bloated. I could bring my veggie friends/family here too. I knocked a star off because despite being not too busy we waited and waited to close out our check. She was too fast taking the order, and too slow to close us out. We didn't get to order any dessert because of our long wait with empty plates. Despite the unevenness of the service no one was rude or unpleasant and the pocket was so good we'll come back.  Next time I'm going to have the Reuben stuffed in there, my daughter wants to try the meatball and my husband just might have a Pilgrim (Thanksgiving in your hands! Lovely!) I know everyone can find a Pasty that they would like to eat here and I encourage you to go! Update: We did go back and have the above selections and I got a Chicken Tikka salad to share. Fabulous! I enjoyed the second visit even more. The Pilgrim is undeniably yum, the Reuben was chockfull of flavor, the meatball delighted my daughter but was so-so for me. The Indian spiced chicken was so tasty I wish they made it into a Pasty too. They do Lamb Vindaloo, so why not? I still recommend this place and will likely return a thrid time... so yummy.

We can only catch this place on the weekend, they close by 2 and sometimes there is a wait, but every time we have gone, the food has been excellent. You can order the food the way you like, requesting egg whites, no tomato, whatever you need to rearrange the omelette's or other choices to your taste and the food comes promptly. Large menu which also has lunch items and combos, not just breakfast fare. Nice fruit plate, options for Vegetarians, Omnivores and Carnivores. The wait staff is pretty attentive, keeps up on refills and smiles. The price is about where good breakfast food is these days, this isn't a 99cent breakfast slam, it's approximately 8 bucks per choice, other things are a la cart so it's really simple to get what you like. I got the California Benedict, with just right amounts of canadian bacon, avocado, hollandaise and english muffin. The potatoes weren't burnt or raw, and I could season them myself. Other people got spinach florentine, frittata, steak and eggs, protein platter. Serving size is just right, for the lighter eater, might be a little left over. They can split checks when you ask. Parking lot is decent sized, but this place is popular. My advice is visit around 8:30am. You'll beat the crowd and be very happy.

Yasu. It's been on my list for a while now and I finally got a chance to go. We selected a Saturday night without reservations and hoped for the best. We arrived and immediately were seated on the benches at the sushi bar at our request. The decor was very pretty and clean, I liked the folded and tied napkin, and the smooth black river rock. It had no purpose but to be pleasant and calming. We quickly forgot we were in a strip mall in AZ. The server greeted us immediately and we just as quickly disappointed him when we chose not to select any fine alcohols, but he was polite and began a description of the foods available this evening. I knew I was going to have a hard time picking from the decadent options, but since I needed to coordinate tastes with my husband, we began gently selecting, eliminating, and balancing all the options.  Here is what we ended up choosing:  Kampachi (baby yellowtail) Sushi  Blue Fin Toro Sushi  These two selections were divine and buttery.  I looked sadly at our empty plate when they were both gone. One taste of each, but it was our first visit, I didn't know better. My regret is not selecting the Sashimi option. Next time I am getting Sashimi for sure.  Miso Soup with Clam. We needed to try the home made Miso. Wherever you go it's one good indicator of quality and while it was good, we should have chosen one bowl to share instead of a bowl each. We enjoyed it, but in the future we won't waste a selection spot on the Miso, much less two spots. That was silly of us.  Grilled Diver Scallops with Uni Cream Sauce. We looked for the bacon wrapped scallops, but they weren't an option. I loved the meaty well prepared scallops and enjoyed pouring the Uni cream all over. The presentation was pretty, but it was only a nibble of asparagus. As asparagus is relatively cheap, they could offer a bit more than one stalk quartered into a tiny Lincoln log pile. Maybe three stalks fanned with grill flavor? Still the presentation reminded me to eat slow and savor my bites. Easily the tastiest dish.  Sauteed Mirugai with Assorted Mushrooms.  I enjoyed the shredded red threads that garnished the pile of earthy blended clam and mushrooms, but my husband did not like that texture. There wasn't anything wrong flavor wise with the dish, it was pleasant for me, but not a wow.  In this spot we might have been more pleased with an item from the grill or something with tempura.  As our server got pulled away to the benched people next to us, we took his advice when it was time to order more things and spoke directly to Taki and Yasu, who happened to be right in from of us. We did come here for sushi, so we ordered: Spicy Tuna, Phoenix Roll and Yasu roll. How can you not order a roll named after the owner? While we waited for these next things, the benches were starting to be quite uncomfortable. No backs and a ridged lip were starting to make us shift about. We couldn't see what the Sushi chef was doing through the panel in front of us anyway, so while it was nice to be so close to the chef's we decided that next time we will sit in the dining room. Out came the rolls. I really think they are the same roll with very minor differences. Roe in one and cucumber wrapped around the other. I thought they were very tasty though. I only used a small bit of wasabi and soy, but that wasn't truly necessary, just habit. The spicy tuna didn't impress me as much, and it was here that I decided Yasu was truly more a Bistro than a sushi bar. Not in a bad way, just a note to myself that it's best for all the plated selections more so than the sushi. No reason for it NOT to be a fabulous sushi bar, as everything was so fresh, but something was missing for me and I couldn't put my finger on it. Some of the best fish I've had, yet not the best sushi?  Then we ordered the Salmon Sashimi. That was fabulous! Sliced thick enough, clean, amazingly smooth it reminded me I screwed up getting Blue Fin Toro as a sushi instead of Sashimi. I ate slowly, not wishing everything to be over yet, but my husband was full. I had come starving. I shouldn't do that! I batted my eyes a bit and said softly... Dessert?  We had the Green Tea Cheesecake with Chocolate fondue. They piped the cheesecake spirally onto three skewers and laid them each onto one topping: small bit of coconut, candied pineapple and pecans. The chocolate fondue was milk chocolate and was best used as a drizzle instead of a dip. I was very indelicate with the dessert, finding the skewer quite awkward. I just used my thumb and forefinger to slide the Cheesecake off and popped it into my mouth. I shrugged. Not classy of me, but it worked. I would use a harder cheesecake format and cube it for dipping, instead of that presentation, but it was different!  Our cost with 18% tip was $125. All in all I was very glad we went to Yasu and we will go again to try many more things. Very pleasant waitstaff, nice evening. Recommended.

Oh my.  The solidly 4 star reviews directed me to not miss out on this authentic Middle Eastern eatery in my neighborhood so with happy anticipation we sashayed into the place named Fattoush; but it wasn't the restaurant I read about below in the glowing reviews. I totally missed out on this fabulous Fattoush experience. I wanted to go to the place you all visited, badly!  It's making me not want to review things. I look mean or snobby, but I'm really not. Let me share the experience with you. We were alone, except for a relative eating his dinner. The lady asked if we wanted take out, but we wanted to eat in, She seemed surprised and disappointed. She took her time getting the menu's and she took 15 going on 20 minutes to deliver two green ice tea's. I'm not kidding~ I watched the Iraqi shaped wood clock pass the time while she chatted on her cell phone. I watched her back mostly. She paced back and forth from the man enjoying his dinner and the behind the counter area.  I'm thinking we should at least have drinks and soup by now. Sigh. Was she brewing the ice tea... from scratch? The iced tea came warm and the soup came cold. There weren't any solids in the soup it was green lentil broth. Would have tasted great if it was warm and had lentils. The soup bowl was nuked. I could tell because my chipped bowl was hot, like in a typical poor microwave situation. We were abandoned by the server, no ability to send it back, she was busy on the phone. She wasn't taking orders on it, it was a personal call. A long personal call. We ordered the King combo dinner for two. Might as well sample a lot of things to be fair. We got to sample very over cooked and dried out meats. re-heated rice that clumped, curdled yogurt, tabouili without bulgher,vinegary dolmades, greasy spinach pies, crusty falafal, mediocre hummus and burnt babaganoosh with a huge pool of oil in it. Flies buzzed over our meal and I shook my head. This whole platter was pre made and microwaved and it wasn't good. Not one item was worth a positive review. Swishing the flies away, I was regretting the visit. We had empty tea glasses and wanted to get more drink, but the lady was now talking with a woman who walked in and wanted to give them some figs. From her yard or something. I don't know.. it was, "Let's not Pay any Attention to the Customers Time" I think.  Re heated poor foods, coupled with inattentive service sealed Fattoushes review. We were ready to pay and leave. My partner is questioning my judgment on these yelp approved places. We keep trying them and getting bitterly disappointed.  We went up to the counter to pay as we didn't want to wait longer for a bill to be presented. The lady said "I hope you liked it!" She seemed to want me to be happy, but I'm sorry. I made a small polite smile and left a small tip.I don't think this place is worth returning to.

I'm just reviewing the Ubuntu release party because I didn't use RedSeven's store as a service, but I did witness them being of assistance and service to several people there.  I went to the Ubuntu release party as a gesture of love to my partner. This is their world and I try to be supportive. I thought it would be a cool idea to get them mixing it up with other people who know what Ubuntu is, what OS is all about.  We came early at 5 and there were already a few people milling about the showroom. My partner commented over the evening how it was nice to see diversity in the crowd. People might think only cutting edge boy-geeks or CS majors were going to hang out at such a place, but there were women there (and not just as guy attachments either!) There were young and old and middle age users; users who were advanced and users who were new, people who didn't know anything about linux and people who were part of a local linux support group. The bartender for the event was quite fun, making sure you weren't without a drink unless you wanted to be and he chatted up all kinds of stories. No tickets, just a free bar and a tip jar, which meant good times if you're so inclined. The store was clean and was the right temperature for the event. Munchies ranged from chips and salsa to crackers and meats and cheese, macaroons and fresh fruit. Then several pizza's. They had a drawing for some RedSeven swag, but  they were also giving away a FREE Linux computer with the new release installed! I didn't know this when we decided to attend and so we felt we had walked into something quite fortunate. Ah, it was Fortunate for Frank as he was the winner and he was quite happy.  I ran into a lady there who told me why she comes to RedSeven. She had no idea there was an event tonight, but she was there to get things serviced. She is an extremely happy customer of theirs because they have always treated her so nice, they don't overcharge, they've done kind acts for free and basically she wouldn't go anywhere else. Nice to have your customers provide free advertising and that's what happens when you do the right thing. I also saw a flyer for one of  their deals and the price was very reasonable, ok they were much lower than I expected to see in a small business, not big box enviroment. I am very happy to see a small, personally run business do the right thing and stay open.  Kudos should go to RedSeven for hosting an Ubuntu release party. Despite the fact that the company has a vested interest in seeing Open Source proliferate, people should not confuse that with a core philosophy of wanting to encourage this way of computing for the benefit of the whole system. It's kind of like GreenPeace hosting an event that draws attention to their market, yes it may bring new converts and maybe donations to GreenPeace, but it's not all about their pocketbook it's about affecting a change in thinking for the benefit of the whole system.  I enjoyed seeing the excitement in the eyes of people at that event, talking about something they feel will make a real difference. My partner left with a few networking contacts, I left with a few G&Tonics and a smile. All in all a nice Friday kick-off.

The best thing about Hana is that it is in my neighborhood. The worst thing about Hana was that I didn't enjoy the experience and I wanted to! The waiting staff was milling about the door area, ignoring people. I dislike when staff has people to greet but they are busy chatting about their social calendars or whatnot with their backs to the customers. However the chef's behind the counter greeted us very happily. The energy was such that I began thinking, "Hey, this is exactly what I was looking for! Hooray!" After we were seated other people came in and got like a group greeting. Maybe they are regulars. It would be annoying to group greet every single customer. There were two waitstaff running about like crazy chickens doing all the work. I was sort of curious about that, what was the point of having so many people "on" that weren't actively working the tables? We got one of the rushed servers and she spoke so fast we had trouble understanding her. We let her know we were new and would need some time to acclimate to the selections, but we didn't get a break about becoming familiar with what was offered and ended ordering hurriedly. As a result we didn't end up trying as many things as we might have. It's not good to rush people who are planning to explore a menu. I mean we can really spend some serious money on sushi if given half a chance. Despite the fast ordering, it was slow in being made. The chef  seemed busy making boats, so I was ok with waiting... for awhile. Then I just got rumbly and flagged down the server who was at that time actually bringing out my Endamame. Maybe I was impatient? The Endamame wasn't salted and they were cool. Not sure if that's the style for here, but I prefer hot and salted shells that pop open with light pressure. Not these. However it was a good thing I had them, because my wait continued and it would have been intolerable if it hadn't been for the pods. I was determined to be impressed with the fresh fish I read about and was hoping that we'd found a place close to home for happy sushi time. The octopus was not fresh. It was dry and very rubbery. The other fish was decent but there was too much of a fish smell, another warning to me. The  rice didn't hold either. Sloppy or collapsing sushi rolls always annoy me and then if I determine the fish isn't the best, I'm pretty much done. It was ok, but I truly expected it to wow me. I think we came at a bad time. It was dinner, but they weren't packed to the gills. The chef really wanted us to be happy it seemed, he did continually smile and nod our way.  My partner did not let me see the bill. Apparently for what we ordered it was much higher than I would have liked. They always do that if they think I am going to feel upset about the cost/value ratio.  We paid, we left, it's not going on our regular rotation.  We might try it again, because there are an awful lot of good reviews here and it is really close to home, but so far when I've brought it up my partner I hear, "I don't think so" and "you have a really poor memory don't you?" I do my best to recall the happy sushi chef and think... maybe if I came on a good night he would make stronger sushi rolls and the fish would be just delivered and maybe my whole experience would be speical and I'd be thrilled to have Hana right nearby.  As it is Hana gets Two stars= Meh. I've experienced better.

It is with heavy heart I report that Lucille's, brand new to Phoenix, does not live up to its hype.   For shame this place could boast such fine decor, beautiful menus, and pleasant hospitable staff and then char the short ribs to the bone, inedible. If it wasn't for the thick sliced, juicy, fried green tomato appetizer I'd call the place a total bust. The flaky warm biscuits were nice with the honeyed sweet butter, but I know Bisquick when I taste it and I'm sure I've made these before at home. We had high hopes ordering up some blackened catfish, baby back ribs, beef brisket, chicken halves, greens, cheesy grits, garlic mashed potatoes, and a kids meal for the little one with fresh watermelon. First round was the wonderful mason jar drinks, Strawberry lemonade was sweet, fresh and thirst quenching, our muddy waters made with sweet tea and porch lemonade were good enough for three refills a piece. You'll understand however that the refills just had to keep comin' when I explain how the main course turned out.  First they served up the catfish. I could hardly see the fillet behind the nearly three cups of potatoes. When I did taste it I realized this wasn't a blackened catfish this was a water filled thin sliced sponge someone left in the charcoal pile. No wonder it was hidden by the taters. Unfortunately, they were a mass of stickiness with dried chives. I didn't find a hint of butter, or garlic for that matter. My partner is Irish through and through and was dismayed. We didn't even bother putting black pepper on them or finishing them at all. I was excited to try the cheesy grits though. My first fork pulled out a warm melting bite and so I offered some to the little one, with some greens to broaden her Northern palate. The greens were fine, but lacking in the advertised apple-wood smoked bacon. It was more like a chicken bouillon broth. She opted not to have more of either. When I went to have more grits the mixture had cooled and was more of a 4th grade science project than a good feeling.  Then came the meat platter. The chickens looked delectable and I quickly separated the meats from the bone. The dark meats were juicy, but the skin slipped off in a greasy way. The white meat was far too dry for my taste, but fortunately there were three bottled sauces we could mix together to dredge it through. Of course I believe that in a good BBQ the meat can stand on its own and you shouldn't have to dredge it in sauce to enjoy it. The brisket stood on its own. In fact it probably stood all by its lonesome out on a counter for an hour before it reached our table. Maybe cooking it in a bag instead of a dehydrator would have been a smarter method. Then came the hope of the evening, the lump of coal left to taste was apparently five baby back ribs. I had to saw them apart with a knife to free them from the creosote. The limited meat was not even worth trying to eat despite the three table sauces expertly blended to perfection waiting nearby. We tossed it back on the plate with the bones in disgust.  My daughter couldn't determine if her fries were fries or potato chips or onion straws, she decided she didn't really want them. The macaroni and cheese side was a small serving of elbow macaroni which seemed buttered lightly. Her standard is no name instant, the kind you used to buy 5 for a dollar and she was wondering where the cheese was. If I hadn't allowed the poor thing to eat the rest of the biscuits she would have gone home hungry. I will never understand how you can serve a watermelon that isn't juicy. The fruit is 90% water, but hers was an anemic example with seeds. For sure, the place had some fine appetizers and the desserts looked absolutely divine, but we were done before we even got to them and the check was already too high to consider salvaging the meal with a one pound apple pie slice. I cringed when they dropped off a comment card, but in the end I did the right thing and filled it out fair. When I want a great BBQ I think I'll be sticking to BobbyQ's where the St. Louis ribs are rubbed right and then bathed in a sauce you can't stop lickin' and where they send you home with beignets even if you don't order any, courtesy of the house.

Do you like a basic Cheeseburger made fresh with what you want on it?  Have you already tried Fuddruckers, 5 and diner, Hamburger Works, Hamburger Mary's, Lenny's, Ted's, Ruby Tuesday's, TGI Friday's, heck even Outback for a burger that's right?  Do you want thin onion rings that aren't a messy pile of strings?  Is a light tempura coating preferable to a thick greasy breading that falls off? Do you want a choice of over 100 shakes- mix and match flavors or straight up vanilla? Want a place to shake and make your soda flavor custom? Want to pay $30 bucks for a well staffed, courteous, clean establishment and have all of the above? Cheeburger Cheeburger is your place.  Yeah, it's  chain... and it's "off the chain GOOD."   I had a semi-serious size blue cheese and avocado, bacon, Jalepano Jack cheese, sweet onion burger that was gone before I realized it. I had a Cheesecake Snickers shake. I had a waitress named Amy who was totally on the ball. My partner had a buffalo blue cheese chicken sandwich that tasted like hot wings without coating and a Chocolate Peanut Butter shake. Our onion rings were crisp, light and stayed in their tempura coating when we bit them.   The potential health consequences for eating such a carnivore dream is worth every finicky choice you select to get it just right and the waitress has zero problems with your particular perfectionism. Highly recommended for that time when you swore you'd never eat another burger, but there you are ordering one anyway.     Finally...a smile from me and a wave back at the staff when we left. Good job Cheeburger Cheeburger.

Taking my Irish partner out to the pub should be a gesture of pure love. Finding an authentic pub near home should be a joy of epic proportions. Our visit to Tim Finnegans was disappointing. We seem to have difficulty getting attention in places we visit. Here again was a place we had to seat ourselves, get our own menu's, help ourself to silverware all while the place wasn't busy. We sat and when we did get a server she was incompetent. We tried to order food and drinks, but she left the table before we could finish.  We  got our drinks delivered by another server and asked for the appetizer from her. Then we just sat and watched the game on the screen. We watched our original girl take two other tables orders. Out came the appetizer and when it was completely gone, she came over to take our dinner order.  The food: The chips and and curry appetizer was quite tasty, the curry sauce should be thicker to coat the chips more, and it could add some spice, but I thought it was a very novel item. The signature Lamb Shepherd's pie was very disappointing. You can substitute the L with an Sp and drop the silent B and get a better description of it's content. Hormel would be proud. The champ potatoes on top would be better replaced with pastry. My partner's corned beef and cabbage was decent. However the Corned beef was cut in narrow slivers and the meat was bloated with water. On the other hand the cabbage and parsley was very good. The potatoes were the same as atop the pie, they stood up better on a plate. We ordered the bread pudding and thought that the exterior was fabulous, the interior a bit too slimy and the whiskey/bourbon sauce, lacking in flavor or sweetness with a consistency that unnerved. I do not want to use an unsavory term for the consistency of that sauce, but it needs much more sweetening regardless. Take the sauce from Rula Bula and put it on the bread and you'd be much happier indeed! Over all the decor is nice, the place could have a good ambiance especially if they were playing Irish music, they weren't. It was some modern rock station. The check came before the dessert was gone and, well I guess we were done.  Sigh. This really could have been a better experience.

I came to this place because of the new review.   I just love to try new places and when I said Cajun, my partner said "Let's go!" We had a really hard time finding this place, but I'm sure it's because we aren't as familiar with that part of the city. The location is difficult to see from the road and the place was vacant at the dinner hour.  If this new business doesn't last it sure won't be because of the food, the service or the price. So I'm glad to Yelp and encourage people to find it. What do you know, my first 5 star food review!  We ordered Fried Calamari and hush-puppies for appetizers. I couldn't seduce anyone into trying the frog legs, maybe I'll get braver next time. Our appetizer was crispy, quick, yummy and fresh!   Then we ordered a gigantic bowl of Jambalaya, another of Seafood Gumbo, one kid-size Catfish Strips and hush-puppies basket and three drinks. The large bowl of Andouille sausage based Jambalaya was divinely balanced with rice and celery and chicken and my partner loved it. Would eat it every day if we lived closer. The Seafood Gumbo was chock full of flavor, chunks of seafood, tender juicy shrimp, a very yummy, thick savory broth.  Neither dish was overpowered by some hot spice we couldn't handle. The chef made sure you were tasting the dish instead of begging for water. After eating half of each we got this wild idea of blending them both together in one bowl. OMG, that was an ultimate flavor sensation! I highly recommend it. My daughter munched on her catfish strips and hush puppies happily and even dunked into the roumelade she normally avoids. She didn't finish because she ate too much appetizer. I couldn't fault her there, the Calamari had just come in that morning. We packed a bit up to take home, but we couldn't avoid a slice of Pecan Pie. I liked the pie a lot, my partner prefers theirs sweeter. I wonder if I can buy a whole pie there? hmmm I forgot to ask.  Oh! The Service was spot on, I never wondered about my drink refills, every time I looked they were full, she was super nice, the chef came out and chatted too. They've been open about a month and it's been slow. They have their liquor license and everything, nice little patio around the outside, yellow walls, and tiled floor. Nice, clean place, very friendly. I really hope they get some traffic in that location though. The bill was $44 for everything we bought and was worth it. I wish they were closer to home and we'd make them a regular stop.   Their name says it all Chez Monieux if you don't try them out!

Hung out with Eugene on an UYE from the talk thread. We again visited an empty Chez Monieux. People!! Get your butts in the seats. Ask for some Purple Haze one of the refreshing beers they have and hunker down for some New Orleans chow. I got some wonderful calamari, not overly greasy despite being deep fried and the rings weren't strings they were tubes. Eugene got a fried Tomato salad. We ate Etouffe and a Mama's Bowl. We all had pecan pie. Wish we lived closer, it's very tasty. I was too full to get jalepeno hush puppies, but now that I'm writing this update I want some. They are closed on Sunday's and if people don't come... well I'd hate to see them close more.

I live really close, but every time I think to try this place I realize.. it's a Sunday. They are closed Sunday's. (This has changed, starting Aug 24th, they are open) Drove me nuts, so I finally went on a Monday night. We knew before we went that we wanted to try a pizza and a pasta and see what the whole venue was like. We get there and the owner greets us at the door, his enchanting Italian accent made my daughter smile and she likes the painting on the wall too. We listened to the lovely Halibut special and I was thinking, hmmm that sounds nice, but we already had a plan of action.  Partner chose the Antipasto, I wanted the Calamari. Since I always get my way I ceded it to their choice this time. I think it was a mistake. We weren't happy with it at all which is due to an expectation that the Antipasto is a salad not a finger food plate. This one was neither, sort of an odd mix of italian items that didn't lend themselves to eating easily. My daughter didn't want any. She was more fascinated with the bread diamonds that came out right away. We really should have gotten the Calamari IMO.  They had both grilled and Fritte calamari. I'm going back to try the grilled ones soon. We ordered the Linguini Carbonara which was to die for! it was so fabulous everyone wished they had their own bowl instead of us splitting it up. I wanted the Gnocchi, but wow... that was great Carbonara sauce. It is true in the reviews that the pasta is better than the pizza. We got a Frescolina Pizza. We all thought the Mozzerella was fabuous, the sauce was right, not acidic, the crust was ok, my partner did not agree, thinking it was a bit chewy, not crisp enough.  I liked the fact that the lemonade was fresh squeezed. So tasty. The service was spotty. Attentive yet spacey, we asked for straws and got only one. Had to ask again and the server was confused. He noticed that we got the straw that he brought, right... um.. oh you another straw... ok. (cough) Three drinks, Pancho... 3 straws pls. Asked for a refill of my iced tea only once, then they were all over it, keeping it full but they didn't refill my partners drink ever. Oh they hate that. Odd.  Whenever the owner came by, he was very kind and enjoyable and was right on top of clearing things and checking on our happy level. He interacted with my child in a fun way.  Interesting little space. I liked the decor, I felt happy in the space. My partner felt crowded, my daughter was glued to the Olympics on the TV. We ordered the Canoli for dessert. It was so-so. Not the best I had. I'd skip it next time. The Owner was very nice to the other couple who were having their first visit also, so I noticed that.  I sort of wish there were some more options for toppings on the pizzas and maybe he will be able to branch out in the future if he gets a lot of repeat business. I'd like a white pizza option too. Let's see for rating this place: If my partner was doing this review they would give two stars, my daughter would do 5 stars and said so on the way out the door and I would do 4 stars, for an average of 3.6 (rounded up they get a 4).   Viva the independent business!  Please support them. It's a tough economy and I don't want this strip mall pizza place turned into some Papa John's  franchise.

Returned on Monday, ate some wonderful Linguini Carbonara, got the gnocchi, had the Calamari salad and the Ceasar salad... Again lovely food.  The main reason for this update is that they are opening on Sundays starting August 24th! Whoo -hooo!  He is thinking that during the fall it might make sense to be open on Sundays. Let's prove him right. ---- Went again, tried the Seafood Ravioli and another Pizza... Tasty! We're quite hooked on the Linguini Carbonara though. While the Seafood Ravioli was delicious, it was 6 ravioli. We each got two and, portion wise, it's not enough. Quality not quantity, I know. Now my child wants the ravioli all to herself next visit. Will she ever eat Chef boy R Dee again? I don't think so. Just a parental warning. Eating quality foods may diminish your childs ability to be satisfied with 10 cans for 10 bucks.

Sweet Venezia is brand spanking new. I want a new Gelato shop to do well that is this close to home. Sweet Venezia isn't ready for prime time yet. They have a nice space, they have parking, the place is clean.   However, they need to make their refrigeration colder, the gelatos were all soupy and melty. My fudge gelato was grainy as if there was a powder base and frankly... I drank it. Now we did stop in for drinks as well, but that wasn't what I had in mind. My partner ordered the Jungle Jolt and the person there wasn't sure how to make it. The other person cleaning wasn't sure either. They made a float, it worked and my partner liked it well enough.  I wasn't happy with the consistency or overall quality of the gelato, but they are brand new and it might take them a bit to get their chill on properly. Maybe I'll check them out in a month or two and see if things are better, but I'm still in love with Arlecchino's and they aren't much farther away.

Today's visit to MOD is my last. I always give a place three times, especially when they are new and getting their bearings before I absolutely quit them. I'm going to discuss their 3rd strike because that's why I'm done.  Have you ever walked into somewhere and felt you weren't welcome? I feel that every time I walk in there. I am professionally dressed and my money is good, but today apparently not good enough for MOD.  They have Kyoto cold brew drip coffee available. I've bought it before, I've gotten one that was 16 ounces. I've bought other coffee there in larger sizes, but it's too bitter for me. Today I wanted the Kyoto Cold brew in the larger size. Best of both worlds, less bitter and larger!  The attendant said, "We only sell that item in the 16 ounce size." I looked around for a sign or notice that was the case, but didn't see anything. I thought for a moment and then I said, "Ok, I would like 2 16 ounce Kyoto cold brews please."  "They are expensive," she said.  "That's ok, I'll pay for two," and smiled.  "I can't do that." she said.  "Why not?" I asked curious. Maybe there is a caffeine limit per customer, or maybe they only had 16 ounces of the brew left... I didn't know.  "Well, it's a small batch and I need to save some for other customers."  I thought about that for a second. It was not opening hours, it was 11 am, not like I was killing their supply at 7 am. I tried to understand why purchasing 2 coffees at 11 am was somehow bad for MOD, but the longer I thought the more insulted I got.   "How about I don't buy ANY coffee then. You can sell your coffee to your preferred customers." I walked out. I bought nothing and I won't return.

Yes, you should order meat from here. It looks kinda sketchy in a neighborhood that's not for nighttime, but those are really good sausages and meats!   Yes, you should eat the pieroggies! Sometimes they are not all the way cooked through from frozen though. I take half a star away from them for that. Get some cheese and some beef jerky  for home and pick up some chocolate bars over in the corner on the shelves. They have some with mousse like fillings. Explore the shelves for more interesting Polish treats. You can't argue that it's not authentic.  I give this place five stars for the quality of their meats, but they lose half a star becuase one of the ladies seems so grumpy as if I am imposing on them for wanting to buy stuff, but I bet if I knew Polish she'd be sweet as a grandma.  They lose half a star for not fully cooking the pieroggies twice now, but I love Stanley's anyway.   Cooked in Bacon, they are so bad for you but so yummy in the tummy.   They close sometimes before the close sign, so come before 5pm just in case. Nothing is sadder than looking forward to a nice brat and it's closed. Very small parking spot, but worth it when I'm in the neighborhood.
