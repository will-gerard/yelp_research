We got to experience Macayo's because the local Italian restaurant is closed on Sundays.  How to express the feel...?  Not very busy on a Sunday afternoon around 4 PM...overpriced and certainly light-on-the-tequila margaritas...plenty of chips and salsa being delivered to the table...entrees that took WAY too long to be delivered...portion size and presentation leaving much to be desired...and the waiter kept our water glasses full.  Would you be satisfied with an order of rolled tacos which list on the menu as coming topped with  guacamole?  When the cheese is sprinkled on so lightly that you can count the shred strands on each one?  When the guacamole is served in a 2-ounce solo cup on the side?  I think not!  Another in my party ordered a chicken soft taco and a bean and cheese burrito...the chicken was in shreds, like someone in the kitchen boiled breast, thighs and legs and subsequently shredded them with a fork.  The worst part was no seasoning...save for the salsa served with the chips.  The bean and cheese burrito was a study in rice...so much rice that it was difficult to find the beans and cheese in the burrito.  The fourth in our group ordered the nachos supreme.  The chips are advertised as coming smothered in beef or chicken (he chose beef), cheese, refried beans, tomatoes, sour cream and guacamole.  Again, the guacamole came on the side in a 2-ounce solo cup as well as the sour cream.  They were not requested on the side...but they came that way.   As I am in search of the best guacamole burrito on the planet, that is what I ordered...a burrito that is guacamole, sour cream, bacon, cheese and raw onion.  The burrito I received...got the guacamole...got the cheese...got the sour cream...missing the onion...and some really fatty bacon.  It has been a long time since I had a guacamole burrito that chewy.  Margaritas were just a flat-out mistake.  I guess you have to know someone behind the bar to get much more than the faint whisper of a tequila bottle being passed in front of the glasses.  When they are delivered, they look incredible...the glasses filled perfectly...the salt on the rim done so well you could take a measuring tape to the glass and find perfect consistency all the way around.  While I enjoy the look of a well-presented margarita, I wanna feel and taste tequila in it!  Maybe this works for the family 'hispanic eatery down the street'...it does not do so well for me.

Thinking about airport food in Phoenix...NEVER AGAIN in front of Security!  Normal patterns have me flying out of Phoenix Friday evening and returning Sunday about noon.  Because of the only constant in life being change, I am now flying outta Phoenix Wednesday morning and back Friday morning.  Since it was 8:45 AM, I had no idea what I was going to find once I passed through Security, so I figured I would give Oaxaca a try.  Like most airport restaurants, it looks clean.  The menu, while varied, did not allow much for an innovative order.  My hispanic food passion of late is a guacamole burrito.  It's guacamole, onion, cheese, sour cream and bacon.  Between the milquetoast anglo morning register guy (looks too young and acts too immature to be called a "manager") who rang up my burrito by item...including the tortilla for the burrito...$8 for a burrito to go was a bit more than I anticipated.  Prices on the regular burritos and other offerings were a bit more reasonable, so I anticipated a pretty large burrito.  Milquetoast, the register guy, asked if I preferred strips of bacon or if I wanted my bacon crumbled.  I asked for strips.  He then asked if I considered 2 strips sufficient, or if 3 sounded better.  I replied that I would take what I could get for the somewhat large charge ($2.09) I paid for bacon.  Milquetoast then spoke to the grill guy in broken schoolbook Spanish.  The grill guy looked at the receipt and turned to ask me if I wanted eggs or potato in the burrito.  When I replied that I did not, he asked me if this was a breakfast burrito or a lunch burrito.  Looking at my watch and seeing it was still before 9 AM, I replied that it would be a breakfast burrito unless it was cheaper for me as a lunch burrito.    The grill guy turned and scooped crumbled bacon onto the grill, added onion and slapped down a tortilla.  Everything heated and he assembled the burrito.  I could not see all of his activities, so when he put a burrito on a plate and called me over, I reminded him this was ordered to go.  He wrapped up the small burrito and handed me burrito and salsa in a bag.  I turned and headed toward Security to get to my gate.    On arriving at my gate, I sat down and prepared to enjoy breakfast.  The burrito was as light as it was small.  While I had requested strips of bacon, the crumbles were well distributed through the burrito.  It is too bad that the guacamole and cheese were not, and there was no sour cream anywhere on the burrito.    While my typical reaction in such a situation is to return to the restaurant, there just was not time to go back in front of security to display the incorrect order.    If there is a next time, I just need to stick to the regular menu.

In pursuit of the Mexican guacamole/bacon/cheese/sour cream/raw onion burrito, I just was not satisfied with what I received.  Sunday afternoon, around 2 PM.  I had taken a stroll to Fry's to get the current beer of preference (Anyone know where I can find Cave Creek Chili Beer?) and on the walk home, I went past Riva's.  The location strikes me as being a drive-through banking location at some time, tho since closed and relocated.  Windows, floors, walls are clean; even the parking lot is clean.    As the TVs played novelas, I looked at the great variety of offerings, each with a picture in pretty vivid color, along with the name and price.  On approaching the counter, I asked if I could order a custom burrito.  The lady behind the counter asked what kind of burrito I wanted.  I explained the guacamole/bacon/cheese/sour cream/onion burrito.  She asked if I wanted egg on it, and I replied I did not.  She walked the slip to the cook and described the burrito.      When the lady behind the counter received my wrapped burrito, she put it in a bag with napkins.  I asked about salsa, and she gestured toward the salsa bar.  Since the aluminum roof was down and there was no sign, I had no idea there was a salsa bar.  I packed one container of each salsa, 1 green and 2 red, along with some carrots and jalapenos.  I must express my kudos to the green sauce, a truly fabulous presentation with enough heat to be 'bout right.  No such luck with the red sauce, which seems to derive most of it's heat from black pepper.  Arriving at home, I put the beer in the refrigerator and unwrapped the burrito.  The heft of the burrito gave me pause.  It weighed just over 1/2 lb out of the wrapper.  I was surprised to see nothing had dripped out of the burrito onto the wrapping.  As this was a Hit and Run first try, I did not go into the Preparing for the 'new restaurant first try' experience.    First bite, I got the slack end of the burrito, so lots of extra tortilla.  Second bite, I was rewarded with meat and onion.  Third bite, I detected cheese and sour cream along with meat and onion, and at the fourth bite, I got evidence of American guacamole.  While I am not sure what size tortilla was used to create this burrito, there was certainly a lot of tortilla folded up.    I must take the time to inquire next opportunity I get to find out where they get their "bacon".  It is certainly the most unusual preparation of meat.  There is gristle in addition to fat and chunks that are bigger, have different consistency and remind me strikingly of ham.  There are pieces that feel and taste similar to bacon...just hard to know what it is I am eating.    For the price, $6.80 plus tax, the burrito was below what I would anticipate.  Guess I need to search out BajaMex or TexMex to find what I am looking for...

Gas service is good here as prices are less than the surrounding locations; unfortunately, service in the store is sadly lacking.  Walking into the store, sometimes there is a security person who is watching.  Not sure what they are watching, as half of the folks walk out without having their bags or receipts checked, while the other half are asked for their receipts and to take their items out of the bags to verify the items in the bags are on the receipts.    The store has more groceries and other items than the Frys at Southern and Mill; it carries less inventory than the location at McClintock and Baseline.  For some reason, there is a greater security presence here than either of the other two stores.  In shopping morning and evening, the number of cashiers varies widely...from more than 5 earlier in the day to none later in the day.  When I am checking out, I like personal service instead of the self-checkout.  It is easier to check out with someone behind the register instead of relying on the computer.  I guess I am going to have to treat all Frys stores the same way...they need to EARN my business.

In wanting to double-check a tire and its' recently developing a need for air to be added each week, I went by Discount Tire on a Saturday at noon.  On my arrival, I observed a very busy shop.  I went in and stood at the register, with the plan to speak to an associate about having the tire checked.  The wait was a few minutes, and the associate I ended up speaking with was a bit short.  Maybe it was because he was on his way to a break or lunch...he was just somewhat abrupt in answering my questions.  When I asked how long the wait would be before the car would get in, he told me 2 hours.  When I asked how much it would cost to check the tire, he said he could not tell me until the tire was checked.  He asked if I had further questions, and when I said no, he turned and left, apparently for the break room.    As I had searched up the closest tire shops online, I was aware I could make an appointment online, so I logged in right there and made an appointment to return for the check and possible service need.  According to the scheduler, I could return at 3 PM and have no wait.  I made the appointment, left and returned at 2:45.  On my return, I was greeted at the register by Fernando. who made it a point to give me his name and his business card.  While I explained to Fernando what I was concerned about, he was listening and evaluating all 4 tires on the car.  He pointed out a nail in a tire I was not even concerned about, and let me know he wanted to check all 4 tires, even though I was only concerned about 1.  While I was not on a tight schedule, I asked about how long the check would take, and he advised it would be a maximum of 45 minutes.  He asked if he could call me on the phone number I left when I made the appointment and reconfirmed the number.  When I asked if the location had wifi, he told me it did not, but directed me to the coffee shop a few stores down that did.    I got a text when the check was done, about 40 minutes later.  On returning to the shop, Fernando met me as I was opening the door.  He had my evaluation paperwork and keys, and as we walked to the car, he told me that he found no problems on any of the 4 tires, even the one that had a nail in it.  He produced the nail and told me how it had penetrated the tread but not the interior of the tire.  When I asked how the pressure might be changing in the tires, he reminded me of the cooler temperatures that had been around of late, and how the air pressure could vary a bit with the temperatures not getting as hot during the day.    4 stars, absolutely.  In my mind, had the first associate not been quite so short, this Discount Tire would have gotten a 5 star review.

The history, the people, the license plates...  I first experienced NuTowne from 1989-1991.  Imagine my surprise on returning to Phoenix in 2011 and finding NuTowne (after a drastic renovation due to a fire) remains!  Daddy Ron is still here...and the rest of the staff make sure everyone feels welcome.  Sunday and the beer bust are a legend that continues and I have taken my turn as the Burger Beyotch on several occasions.  It is my chance to take part in a continuing history of the oldest gay bar in Phoenix.  If you desire a great Sunday afternoon with a beer and a burger, chicken breast or a hot dog from the grill, NuTowne is the place to go.  No one cares if you are gay or not...just be prepared for someone to grab your a$$ if it is cute.

Cable that goes out consistently (12-3 PM daily)...a technician who says the whole building needs new coax...a management company that requires the maintenance supervisor to approve direct drops...and a field tech with a 10 AM to 12 PM window who does not call until 12:06 PM...just not very good.  Taking an opportunity to flex my work schedule a bit, I made an appointment for Cox to be out today.  Watching the clock and realizing that there will be no cable work done today astounds me.  12 PM arriving, I gather everything to head in to work.  As I am opening the car door, the technician calls...says he was just notified about the job.  I let him know reschedule is the only option...and called Cox.  Clerk who answered tries to tell me no one needs to be available for the direct drop to be run.  Before I can explain that my apartment complex is not like most others in the valley, that I have to bring the tech to the office to have the maintenance supervisor notified to come meet him...hear what he is going to do and provide the authorization...she puts me on hold after saying she will verify I do not have to be home.  3 minutes later, she returns to tell me that, indeed, I do not need to be home.  I explain why someone does have to be here...and she offers to reschedule me for tomorrow.  I am not going to do the 'adjust work' thing again, so I ask for Friday, between 10 AM and noon.  At least she upheld the Cox credo...if the technician is late, $20 credit on the bill.  Seems to me a smart ISP could make BANK in Phoenix...

WOOHOO!  Wings that are meaty enough to be worth the price and spicy enough to satisfy!  Driving up, the address and strip mall are screaming "Don't get out of your vehicle here" GHETTO...but since I am a white boy trained in brazilian jui jitsu, I am not worried.  I got out of the truck, acknowledged the skaters and gang bangers and proceeded to the door of the restaurant.    On walking in, the menu items and prices are written on the wall in magic marker.  Some have been changed, some have been removed, and some have been made into weekly specials.  This night, a dozen wings is going for $6.50 before tax.  I place my order and proceed to wander around the empty dining room.  It is clean and spartan...a jukebox that advertises free play...several 1980's vintage video games...no restroom  available...  When I ordered suicidal wings, the lady behind the counter asked if I was sure about suicidal...that I might want to try hot first.  Being a reckless and brave person, I reconfirmed suicidal.  She told me that the order would take a few minutes, and asked if I minded seeds in the wing sauce.  I let her know that if seeds were required for hot wings, I would be OK with them.  The wings are hot, fresh and generous...I have been gratified to have to put 3 bites into cleaning the meat and skin off the wings.  They are hot in seasoning and temperature...I could only get through half an order before having to switch to tortillas, carrots and ranch dressing to cool the fire.    Forehead sweating...tears in my eyes...Marcia's Long Wongs got it right.  Give 'em a try...even tho the restaurant screams GHETTO.

Nurse Tina in the ER...You can draw my blood any time!  Add to the incredibly painless needle stick for the IV a very short wait in the ER, a clean facility, ccomprehensive diagnostic work and a staff that left me with no questions and you have a GREAT hospital.  On following up with my regular MD, the folks there were spot on in their diagnosis.  Not sure what the other reviewers issue is with the place (except for the guy claiming a urine-soaked bed, though I doubt his veracity)...I will certainly put myself under the staff's care here again.

As has often been said, especially by friends in Europe and the Northeast US, "Good pizza joints are rarely cheap...and cheap pizza joints are rarely good."  These folks must have been referring to Gus's.    The call was placed for delivery...a large pizza and 2 dozen wings.  Delivery in about 35 minutes...pizza and wings of decent temperature.    With regard to the pizza, this was just not worth the first bite.  Between the light dusting of cheese, the 9 slices of pepperoni on a large pizza and the rather boring as well as lightly applied sauce, the final disappointment was the crust.  Thin and chewy should not go together for pizza crust.  The wings...so sad.  These apparently came from a bag in the freezer...found at places like Smart and Final.  They are of all the pieces and parts, just very small, little meat on those bones.  Seasoning seemed to be a dry spice applied after the wings were cooked.    Not so worried if they deliver at 4 AM...

In Tokyo, this would be considered a very large location  with a very small inventory.  In Tempe, I consider this a family-owned Japanese QuickieMart.  It's a convenience store with Japanese fare.  Prices are very high and selection is very low.  The fresh produce as touted by several is disappointing.    If it's a Japanese QuickieMart you are looking for, this is it.

In Phoenix on Thursday on a courier run, and had to wait for the last flight of the evening to get home...so back to the magic Yelp mobile app to find Thai for dinner  that was close to transit...  Thai Basil looked to be favorable from the reviews, so I ventured to the restaurant.  From the outside, not too shabby.  3 cars in the lot and 1 person sitting on the curb eating from a take-out box so I figured it would not be busy.  On entering, I saw 3 tables seated.  The waitress met me at the door and asked where I would like to sit.  I replied in Thai that on the east side would be better, so I would not be next to a window with sun burning down.  Seated on the right side, she asked me if I would like water or another beverage.  I advised water would be great.  She put the menu in front of me and went to get water.  When she returned, I told her I was ready to order.  Som Tom, the yardstick by which I measure every Thai restaurant and Jasmine rice.  Waitress asked me if I wanted spicy, 1-10 or Thai Hot 1-3.  I ordered Thai Hot 3, in great anticipation of a flavorful fire!  As I waited, I looked around the restaurant.  Tables were tight on the west side, with a long banquet bench against the west wall and 2-tops all the way along.  On the east side, 2 4-top round high tables and 2 6-top regular height tables appeared to have more space between them.  in looking at the floor, the corners and near the baseboards were quite dirty...and in looking up, there was a lot of dust on the fixtures and the vents.  I began to understand why someone would get food to go and sit on the curb in 115 degrees.  The salad and rice were presented to me in about 10 minutes.  What appeared to be a very large portion of papaya salad, about 3 cups, was an illusion.  The salad was placed on top of a pretty large amount of lettuce, which I did not see until I had taken a few bites of the salad.  I figure I actually had about 1 1/2 cups of papaya salad.  Spice was 5 (makes my nose run, while 8 makes my forehead sweat and 10 brings tears to my eyes).  Disappointing since I ordered Thai Hot 3.  Waitress came to ask if I needed anything and I asked for lime and chili.  Both were brought quickly.  I doctored the order and worked my way through the papaya.  All the lettuce underneath was a disappointment.  Rice was wrong, overcooked to nearly mush.  Until they get the dust and dirt cleaned up, I am doubting that I will return.

Nope...  Not going to give anything more than 1 star.  It's the challenge of giving no review vs. giving 1 star.  I returned to this Thai Basil.  While they have managed to clean up the dust and dirt I saw previously, the wait, the poor presentation of the food I ordered and the lack of any feeling of care from the staff have me not returning to this Thai Basil location.  I waited at the entrance in front of the 'please wait to be seated' sign for 5 minutes.  At 4 PM, there were 3 tables seated.  2 were well into their meals and one appeared to be ready to place their order.  The hostess who finally came to seat me seemed surprised that I had been waiting.  She said "We have plenty of tables.  Why didn't you seat yourself?".  After sitting down, I advised the hostess I was ready to order.  She let me know that my waiter would be by shortly to take my order.  I waited for another 5 minutes.  Waiter came to the table with a glass of water.  He asked if I was ready to order.  When I answered to the affirmative, he asked me to wait while he went to get his pad.  I looked at the glass and saw what appeared to be the impression of a mouth on the lip of my glass.  I had not sipped, so when Waiter returned, I asked him to replace the glass.  He asked why and I directed him to the lip of the glass.  He took the glass and replaced it.  I ordered Spring Rolls as my appetizer, the Thai Basil, Thai hot, with pork and more basil and garlic than might be fit for human consumption as well as the Yellow Curry, also Thai hot, with chicken.  To me, the spiciness of Thai hot is 10 on a 1-10 scale.  5 makes my nose run, 8 makes my forehead sweat and 10 brings tears to my eyes.  I asked for hot oil on the side of the Spring Rolls.  Waiter got the choices and turned to head for the kitchen.    Dining alone, it is time to thank the folks who invented smart phones.  I got caught up on the news, and about 5 minutes later, the waiter came with my spring rollls and curry.  While I had not ordered the curry as an appetizer, my waiter said "It was ready so I brought it."  I asked about the rice that should come with the curry and he said he would go get it.  Spring rolls were the highest point of the meal.  Bean sprouts, lots of cabbage, carrots and mint were there...but I found no noodles and no onion.  The rolls were very dry, as if there were no lime juice or fish sauce used in the preparation of the rolls.  Fortunately, between hot oil and sweet and sour sauce, the whole experience was OK.  As I finished the rolls and my water, Waiter appeared with my rice.  He asked if the spring rolls were good, and I relayed the missing lime juice and fish sauce situation.  He took my glass and went to refill.  Yellow curry with chicken: Just not happening.  The veggies (carrot, onion and potato) and chicken chunks tasted like they were cooked separate from the coconut milk and curry.  Veggies were decent sized pieces, tender, though they did not have the curry flavor infused.  The coconut milk and curry...very runny and missing that texture of thick.  Maybe if this combination had some time to sit, the flavors would blend and the texture of thick would become apparent.  The curry flavor was nice; the dish came out at about 4 spicy.  The rice, about 1 1/2 cups, was OK.  Not sticky, not dry, a respectable portion in an adequate preparation.    Waiter shortly returned with Thai Basil.  I asked about rice and the waiter said "I brought it when you asked earlier."  When I asked about the portion that was to accompany the second dish, he said he would check.  Thai Basil with pork?  SALTY!  Pork in a "spicy" garlic sauce along with thai basil, bamboo shoots, bell peppers, broccoli, onion and zucchini.  Once again, it seemed like the pork was cooked separate from the sauce and veggies.  It was a bit fattier than I would have expected but cooked to a tender turn.  Plenty of bamboo shoots, tho bell pepper and onion were kind of scarce and chopped in very small pieces.  Broccoli and zucchini were available in sufficient quantity and nicely sized pieces.  The garlic and the basil...hardly what I would have considered in quantities large enough to beg the question of too much for human consumption.  Spice came in at about 6.  The big problem was way too much fish sauce.    Waiter returned to ask about my experience.  He did not carry any rice.  I let him know the dish was much too salty for me, and some rice might help.  He pointed to the rice on the table and asked if there was anything wrong with it.  I replied that it was cold, and according to the menu, rice was to be included with each entree.  He went to the kitchen and brought out a fresh bowl of rice.  I tried the Thai basil with rice to no real benefit.  I just could not get past the salt.  When the bill came, I was charged for a side of rice.  I asked for the manager and she removed the charge.  She did not, however, offer any consideration toward the Thai Basil.    Naah.

Yelp, your mobile app has taken me home again!  It's nice to have a spot that has not significantly changed in the 20+ years that I have been a patron...even tho nearly 20 years has passed between my last visit and my most recent.  Casey Moore's Oyster House patio was the spot one of my instructors selected for the lecture portion of his class.  Every Tuesday, from 2-3:30 PM, we sat at a table and discussed designing costumes/lights/sets/sound for ASU theatre productions.  Between the munchies and the black and tans, our discussions became quite animated and we certainly considered more creative design concepts.  It was quite cool to be able to have class and a beer (or 3) at the same time.  Fast-forward from 1989 (my first experience at Casey Moore's) to 2011 (my return to Tempe for work).  The food is still outstanding, the location is easily accessable, the atmosphere is laid back and comfortable.  The prices, unfortunately, are a bit higher than other places.

Yelp Mobile App...you have steered me toward better dining opportunities.  On searching out the location, we were not impressed with the location...located in the corner of a nearly dead strip mall...we thought this was the hidden gem in the Tempe italian world.  We were somewhat embarassed after we ordered, especially with friends from Milan in our party.  On pulling up to the restaurant, we walked in and waited at the 'seating stand'.  The waitress came after about 5 minutes (she was working to deliver orders to the folks at tables), asking how many were dining and where we would like to sit.  We let her know we were ordering to go, and she motioned us to the bar.  On arriving at the bar and not sitting, we were asked if we were ordering to go or to eat in.  We let the person requesting our order know that we would be ordering to go.  She brought up her pen and order pad and asked what we would order.  We ordered a mushroom/pepperoni/sausage pie sufficient for 4.  Waitress asked if we would wait for our order, and when we said we would go to Big Lots in the same mall, she said we would wait 35-40 minutes for our order.    We walked out and down to Big Lots, finding a few items we could not pass up.  Leaving Big Lots at 30 minutes after we placed our order, we proceeded to put our purchases in the vehicle and headed back to the restaurant to pick up dinner.  When we arrived, the waitress advised we were early, and would we like a beer or glass of wine while we waited.  We declined and stood waiting for the pizza we ordered.  What was delivered 10 minutes later was a 12-inch pie.  While we anticipated a pizza that was sufficiently loaded to take care of 4 people dining, we were sadly disappointed.  We took the pizza we ordered and drove a mile to the homestead.  When we arrived and opened the box, we were all underwhelmed at the toppings.  There were 2 strips of sausage, 5 pepperoni slices and 5 mushroom slices.    While I was reminded that we should have opened the box at the restaurant, I replied that we should give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt.  Was I mistaken?  ABSOLUTELY!  Being hungry, I resisted the normal 'check it out before leaving' concept.   $19.25 for a 12" pizza with such minimal toppings, I was directed to return to the restaurant with the insufficient pizza.  On arriving back at the restaurant, I was told that since I left before lodging my dissatisfaction, nothing would be done about the order I placed, as I might have "peeled toppings off to express my dissatisfaction".   If you want to spend too much money for a pizza, this is the place to go.

On with the relocation...from San Diego back to Tempe...  Last time, I was at Roosevelt and University...lo those 20 years ago...where the stores and restaurants still had class, and did not feel like something cheap and crass...  I'm at Baseline and Hardy this time...and gratified to find Food City because it DOES NOT FEEL like the Bashas/Frys/Albertsons (even tho Bashas owns the store...)  The store is clean...I have yet to see bugs flying around produce...the butcher shop is immaculate...and there are native offerings there.  The prices for many things are lower than at the bigger stores.  Disparity comes apparently with those items that are not so common in a lower/middle class grocery.  Because of an extremely small refrigerator and a roomie who wants 3 of the 4 shelves along with 1 of the veggie drawers, I am buying preferred produce daily on my way home from work.  The folks at Food City are so much more green than the folks at Fresh and Easy...all the packaging and the clean sterile feeling at Fresh and Easy compared to the 'open the box and display the stuff' that Food City has going on...I am more confident with produce I can touch and smell to gauge the freshness/ripeness that I am looking for....

I'm trying the places close by my temporary Tempe home... it's tough to give more than two stars after my experience here.  I walked by on my way to Food Town, and I picked up a menu.  In  perusing the offerings, I was struck by the Thai Basil Chicken combination. I figured with egg roll and Lo Mein, the combination would probably work.  After picking up the Food Town items, I walked toward Gourmet Wok.  On opening the door and walking in, I was the only customer in the restaurant.  When I passed by earlier, picking up the menu, there were no customers in the restaurant.  The only people in the restaurant were a waitress, her child and another lady at the same table.  The tables and chairs...Goodwill Industries.  The menu board...with lots of prices that have not been updated, even though the prices in the paper menu have...I thought I might have found the proverbial 'hole in the wall' for take-away Chinese cuisine.  I compared prices between the picture board, the written menu on the wall and the paper menu in my hands.  The prices on certain items varied based on which source you ordered from.  My Thai Basil Chicken combination cost $6.55 based on the paper menu.  With tax, I paid $7.14.  The person who took my order advised I would wait 5 minutes and my order would be ready.  I walked to the local literature distribution near the front door, where I picked up the coffee-time news.  After reading my horoscope and several articles about truffles, I was called to pick up my order.  3:20 on my watch.  This was either an extremely coordinated cook or certain items were cooked before being commingled with all the ingredients.    The person who took my order brought the bag to the counter, handles looped through one-another.  I opened the bag, took a peek and everything looked appropriate.  I asked for some pepper oil, and was provided with a container.  Out the door and 2 blocks to the homestead...I walked in, unburdened from the trip, washed my hands and prepared to open the box for dinner.    The egg roll...it had been sitting under a heat lamp...there were no grease spots on the envelope.  Cabbage, carrots, but no seasoning...frozen, not prepared fresh.  No Lo Mein...but rice cooked in yellow broth, and it was a little hard, like it could have cooked for 2 or 3 more minutes.  As hard as I tried, I just could not enjoy the rice, either.    Last but not least, the Thai Basil Chicken with no basil.  I'm betting the cook did not read the order, or chickie who took the order wrote down chicken with broccoli, because while there was no basil, the broccoli was in large quantity and cooked to perfection.  The chicken...no.  It must have been cut and then steamed and left in a tray in the preparation area.  The pieces were very uniform, very soft (beyond tender) and flavorless.  While I could not see what the cook was doing in preparation, my bet is that he took already prepared broccoli, carrots and onion and tossed 'em with the chicken pieces, then slathered the whole thing in sauce.    First time, not very impressed.  I will give them one more try, because every time I go by, the place is always empty.  Maybe if they get the chance to impress, and succeed, they could grow.

After spending a day searching for a new apartment, we took the time to find a karaoke location by our new digs.  The Woodshed popped as having the fun we were looking for.    It's a strip mall bar...and since the singing starts at 9:30 PM, nothing else was open so parking was easily available.  On entering, the place looks to be clean and pretty bright.  Clean, yes, and a pretty big group of regulars.    We sat down at a table.  As it did not appear there was any wait staff, I went up to the bar and ordered, a double tall Jack and Coke for my honey and scotch on the rocks for me, along with an order of hot wings.  Bartender got the drinks and told me to come back in 10 minutes for the wings.  The Karaoke guy arrived and set up his laptop, powered up the microphones and started some kind of mix playing.  He set out his books and song sign-up slips.  We got a book and quickly found two songs each.  On handing in our slips, we were told we would be singers 3 and 4 for the first round.  I headed back up to the bar to be greeted with wings.  They were good-sized and well-cooked, and while the sauce was flavorful, it was not very hot.  Singing started, and the performers were quite good.  We will be back.

Wow...  I cannot believe the number of times I drove by without noticing this restaurant in the strip mall.  Today, I noticed.  In reading the reviews for China Town Buffet after my visit, I must echo the sentiment that I took a risk and lost.  First strike came on my arrival at 3:30 PM.  The menu lists prices by age and time.  Though the restaurant does not close between 3:30 and 4 PM,  there is no price listed for this time.  The register person asked me for $11.49 when I stepped up.  I pointed out the menu and my watch, that the time was 3:30 PM and there was no consideration for 3:30-4 PM.  He advised that because the dinner menu was far superior to the lunch menu, and they had already started to change from lunch to dinner menu, my charge would reflect the dinner menu price.  I asked for a menu, to compare the difference between lunch and dinner; the register person replied that as it was a buffet, no menus were available.  Pursuing the topic, I asked how to know the dinner menu was superior to the lunch menu.  Register dude replied that everything on the buffet would be replaced fresh...that was one major benefit.  He could not name any item differences, only that the whole thing would be fresh again at 4 PM.  The restaurant is a bit worn down...tho no springs are showing through the upholstery.  I figured since I was at changeover time between lunch and dinner, and had been advised that the dinner menu was far superior to the lunch menu, I could wait until everything had been replaced (4 PM), so I enjoyed some water while I perused email and news and got caught up on all the electronic communication I could.   The table was wiped, though the salt and pepper shakers and napkin holder were a little sticky and apparently have not have been cleaned in a long time.   4 PM, when the dinner presentation should have been new, I went to the buffet, picked up a plate and made myself available to the offerings.  California roll looked OK, though old as the avocado had turned black.  Other offerings on the sushi tray were not quite so attractive; shrimp and fish starting to dry.  At the hot buffet, Lo Mein was new (I saw it loaded into the steam tray) and had a pool of grease in the bottom of the pan.  Some other items were full containers (not sure if new, but full), while others were obviously hangers on from the lunch setting, being half or more empty with dry contents.  Service guy would show up about every 5 minutes, stir stuff that was in less than full containers, pick up empty containers and put full containers into place.  I asked him when the dinner service would be ready.  He replied "No English".  I took my Lo Mein and California roll back to the table.    Heat for Lo Mein on arrival at the table was lukewarm.  Plenty of celery, plenty of soy (not fish) sauce, some cabbage and carrot, nothing noteworthy.  The California Roll...eeh...adequate view, poor preparation, strike two on the event.  There was mayonnaise in the rice, the carrot was shredded, not chopped, the avocado was black as it sat.  Wasabi was probably not fresh, certainly not hot.  On working through the California Roll and Lo Mein, I kept an eye on the hot bar, waiting for the 4 PM start (it's 4:15 PM at this point).  In my wait, I took the opportunity to go to the restroom.  While the dirt is not ground in, the bathroom should have been maintained sometime between opening and now, as the soap scum on and around the sink, the full trash container and the toilet paper on the floor do not inspire confidence in the running of the establishment.    Returning from the restroom, I saw that the General Tso chicken has been replaced, tho nothing else of interest.  Picking up a new plate, I went back through the line behind a husband, wife and 10-year old (my guess...he was over 4 ft tall).  Watching Mum and Dad work their way down the buffet was unremarkable.  Watching Junior using his fingers and fork to sample any item that looked interesting, including General Tso Chicken, so sorry...not gonna follow after for 'sampled' food.  I returned to the table...picked up my cellphone and promptly left the restaurant.  There was no way I could continue.  EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW

If any restaurant were to rate a 0, it would be Someburros.  Between slow service and not being able to make a custom order, the white girls that run and manage this restaurant need to take a lesson from some Hispanic folk who run a home-owned operation.  On arriving at the Someburros location in Tempe, 4:00 PM on Sunday afternoon, I observed about 1/3 of the tables had someone sitting there...all eating or waiting.  There was one person at the counter schmoozing with one of the order chickies...not placing an order, just speaking to her in a quietly nasty nasal voice.  The other chickie was bouncing between the drive-thru and the phone, while first girl flirted obliviously...  I stood at the register for 2 minutes before chickie who was flirting realized I was ready to order.  She meandered over and asked what I wanted, for here or to go.  Being on the guacamole burrito quest, I let her know I wanted to order a custom burrito, specifically that contained guacamole, bacon, cheese, sour cream and raw onion. 4:04 PM I have a receipt for the order.  Chickie created a 'burro' that was a Bacon&Egg Burro (3.85) with no potatoes, no egg, add  guacamole (1.35), add Sour Cream (.96) and onion (.15) for a total after tax of $6.89.  Chickie asked me if I wanted salsa and marked my receipt.    I moved back to a position in proximity to the delivery station.  Orders older than mine moved out through the line.  Several large orders made their way out and folks received them to carry home.  4:16, I am called...I picked up my order and headed out to pick up the Valley Metro Limo.  Once at home, I opened up the burrito I received based on my order.  This was a 10" tortilla with cheese, sour cream and raw onion.  The meat I received had no visual resemblance to bacon.  It is a most unusual preparation of meat.  There is gristle in addition to fat and chunks that are bigger, have different consistency and remind me strikingly of ham.  There are pieces that feel and taste similar to bacon...just hard to know what it is I am eating.  Most glaringly absent: guacamole.  I picked up my receipt and called the restaruant.  Michelle answered and asked immediately if she could put me on hold.  I asked how long she expected it to be and only heard a click in reply.  2 minutes later, Michelle picked up again and asked if I could hold.  I asked if I had to and she replied "Yes" before making the phone click again by putting me on hold.  2 minutes later, Michelle picked up again and told me to "Please hold" and pushed the button before I could reply.    When Michelle picked up for the 4th time, I cut her off before she could say "Please Hold" again by asking if the manager was available.  She said she was, laid the phone down (without putting me on hold) and went to get the manager.   Next, white girl Sara picked up the phone and asked how she could help me.  I shared that I was in about 30 minutes prior and ordered a custom burrito.  She said she remembered, and called me by name.  I told her the burrito had no guacamole and she asked me if I could return to the restaurant so she could give me the guacamole.    I advised I was riding the bus and the next round would not be available for over an hour.  She told me to hold onto the receipt, write her name on it, and next time I was by, she would give me a portion of guacamole.  I asked if the restaurant was busy and she replied that it was steady.  "Is it reasonable, then, for me to have waited 6 minutes and been put on hold 3 times?" Sara said that the girl running the phones may have been a bit overwhelmed and that it would not happen again.  I am certain it will not happen again as I highly doubt I will waste my time returning to a hispanic restaurant run by white girls.

Yupha's is close to home and A SERIOUS FIND!  On a Friday evening, 7 PM, I got the urge for papaya salad.  My Yelp mobile App found Yupha's as one of the Thai restaurants close to home.  I got in the truck and headed east to Yupha's in anticipation of, because it was Friday, a bit of a wait when I got to the restaurant.  Arriving at Yupha's, the parking in front of the restaurant was pretty full.  Entering the establishment, I took in what was about 20 tables seated, some dining, some waiting for food, and some just finishing their meals.  I was met at the door quickly and ushered to a table.  The waitress presented me with a menu and asked what I would prefer to drink.  I ordered water and looked at the menu.  My water was delivered in about a minute, and I advised I was ready to order.  The waitress took my order for Som Tom, Thai Hot, along with a side of Jasmine rice.  The prices in the menu are cheaper than the prices on the website, so I was pleasantly surprised.    The restaurant is easy on the eyes...subdued lighting, tinted windows and partitions throughout that provided a sense of defined space and some privacy at the same time.  Music was subtle, conversation there, but not too loud.  The water was filtered and served with lemon, very refreshing.  My wait for dinner was not nearly as long as I anticipated.  From ordering to being served, I waited barely 5 minutes.  The portions of salad and rice were both impressive, about 2 1/2 cups for the Som Tom and about 1 1/2 cups of rice.  The salad was nearly perfect!  The spice was right on (5 makes my nose run, 8 makes my forehead sweat, 10 (Thai Hot) brings tears to my eyes.  The dressing was a bit sweet for my tastes, so I asked the waitress for some lime.  She was gone barely 30 seconds and back.  The accents of sweet, sour, spicy and salty were perfect!  I also experienced hints of garlic that were just right.  My server came back and asked if I needed extra napkins as the tears were beginning to run down my face.  I advised that everything was wonderful and I had enough napkins.    Thank you, Yupha!  You have certainly proven your skills!  I also appreciate that you have the fortitude to display that firearms are not allowed in your restaurant.  It is gratifying to see that you are willing to state your preference toward a violence-free experience.  Know that I will return!

Not anymore.  20 minutes to check out, as only the self-checkouts were open and available.  5 people cruising around in front of the closed "person-operated" registers but no manned register opened for over 15 minutes.   25 people waiting in line behind 6 who were at the self-checkout?  WTF?    It's Sunday evening, too many people in line and whomever is in charge does not have someone open a register?  By the time I got to the self-checkout, the ice cream I came to get was pretty much a waste.  I paid for milk, OJ and broccoli, but left the ice cream.  While you are the closest to home, you are CERTAINLY not the best.  You have lost my business.

On the search for an Asian market between me in Tempe and friends in Peoria, the Yelp Mobile App pointed me to Asiana Market.  My quest was for ground chicken, green papaya, Thai fish sauce, lemongrass, Thai basil, Thai chiles, rice noodles, lime, broccoli, green onion.    It's big...it has items from a variety of nationalities around the world...though I saw not a single person of Asian persuasion during my time in the store...not among employees or customers.  Maybe my timing was off; normally, when I shop an Asian market, I am the exception being USA born.    The produce aisle did not impress me.  It's kind of sad.  The dirt seems to be ground in, even though the fruit and veggies being presented are all in boxes.  Prices on some things (ginger root, papaya and Thai chile) are high, while other things are similar to regular grocery stores.  There were some items (broccoli and greens) that seemed to be bordering on the edge of no longer fresh, while other items (lime and green onion) seem to have been harvested a little early.  The basil looked OK, and it was priced comparable to other Asian markets, but there was no lemongrass.  The produce person said it should come in tomorrow.  I went back to the meats, and the selection was not very good.  Ground pork, a few steaks, short ribs, chicken parts (both bone in and boneless), but only 5 or 6 of each out in the refrigerator cases.  I picked up a pack of boneless skinless legs and carried it to the butcher's window, asking if it could be run through a grinder to get a chili grind.  2 butchers behind the counter, nothing being processed at the moment, I figured there would be no difficulty.  I was told that I would need to purchase at least 10 lbs in order to have the butcher run it through a grinder.  I asked about any beef stew meat, and was told that should be in on the delivery tomorrow.  As the price was a bit high and I had no need for 10 lbs, I dropped the chicken and picked up the ground pork (which was frozen).    On to the shelves, which I came to discover were stocked by nationality.  Up and down the "Thai" aisle I went, where I found the rice noodles but no fish sauce.  I cruised other aisles until I finally found the fish sauce from Thailand in the Korean aisle.  It's been 30 minutes so far.  I finished my shopping by picking up a 6-pack of Thai beer.  Headed for the registers.  The first one I reached had one person in line, while the other two that were open had 5-6 people each.  I got in the short line only to be advised that the register would be closing after the current customer was rung up.  Off to line number 2, with 5 other people waiting to ring out.  The cashier was having an issue with getting a new receipt roll loaded into the machine.  I waited a minute and then moved to line 3.  6 customers in front, and the cashier was whirling like a dervish, scanning an item, putting it in the bag, scanning the next item, putting it in the bag...it took 20 minutes to get to the front of the line.  The cashier looked very young, and I hoped my suspicions that he was under 21 were incorrect.  I put the beer on the belt last, and as soon as he saw it, he told me he could not handle the beer.  He picked up the phone and asked for assistance on the register.    The wait began.  The cashier looked around and after about 3 minutes, picked up the phone and called for assistance again.  He had everything except the beer scanned and packed in a bag.  Assistance finally arrived, and the 'over 21' person scanned and bagged my beer.  We completed the transaction and I picked up the bags.    I showed up on a Thursday afternoon, arriving 4:30 PM.  At 5:30 PM, I pulled out of the parking lot and continued to my destination.  Maybe it was an off day...maybe my experience is the exception, not the norm.  While the variety of nationality choices is significant, I have to have certain FRESH ingredients to go with the seasonings.  Since the butcher was reluctant to help, it motivates me to try other Asian grocers.

Guess it's time to train me a new Jack in the Box crew.  On relocating from San Diego, corporate headquarters of Jack in the Box, to Tempe, I finally had the urge to try the neighborhood Jack.  I order the same thing every time I go to Jack in the Box...big cheeseburger, add pickles, add onions, add tomato, extra pickle, extra onion, extra tomato.  If I order at the drive-thru, I am asked if the order on the screen is correct...and I drive forward.    Because the company does not start cooking until an order is made, I am OK with a bit longer wait for delivery.  The strange thing here is that the base price of a big cheeseburger is 40 cents more than in California.  Additionally, I was charged 30 cents (15 cents to add and 15 cents for extra) for tomato.    I get that some produce is a bit more expensive and I am OK with paying an upcharge...but if you are going to charge me, make sure I receive what I paid for.  On being delivered my sandwich, I unwrapped and lifted the top bun.  Plenty of pickle and onion and a burger that is seriously hot.  In asking the drive-thru person where the tomato is, she told me it was under the burger.  Putting the top bun back on and flipping it over, there is no tomato under the meat.  She apologized and walked to the grill area.  Once there, she picked up 2 slices of tomato and brought them to the window.  She had not put on gloves, she had not washed her hands and she offered me the tomato slices.  "Honey, your hands have been on the register and taking money from people.  I'm not going to take any unwrapped food item from you."  I asked for a refund of the 30 cents.  While she processed the refund, I wrapped the burger up.  She handed me change and I headed home.  On arriving home, I ate and called the Jack line, I was advised this location is a franchise-owned store.  The Customer Relations person advised they would let the franchisee know of my concerns.  Oh, regrets...Oh, I have many regrets...

I arrived at 3:30 PM on Sunday afternoon.  There was one table just finishing their meal when I arrived.  The waitress met me at the register and asked where I would like to sit.  She advised me that the restaurant closes at 4 PM to change over to dinner service, so I had 30 minutes to complete my meal.  She asked what I wanted to drink and went to get my water.  On her return, I told her I would like Som Tom, no green beans, Thai hot, with an order of jasmine rice.  She asked my consideration as she did not have her pad and could I wait while she went to get it?  Away she went to retrieve her order book, and on her return, she asked me again what I wanted.  I repeated my order and she wrote it down.  Off to the kitchen she went, looking at her watch as she walked away.  The table seated next to me were finished with their meal.  One of the diners opened the folio, looked at the bill and whistled.  He pulled out a card and walked up to the register.  The waitress came and processed his sale.  As they were walking out, another couple entered the restaurant.  The waitress let them know they had about 25 minutes before the restaurant closed to change over from lunch to dinner, and they might want to consider ordering to go so they would not feel rushed.  They answered that they would do their best to be done by 4 pm, so she brought them to a table.  She presented their menus and asked what they would like to order.  One diner asked for some water and a moment to consider the choices.  The other said they were ready.  The waitress advised she would bring water as soon as they placed their orders.  Once this was done, she went to the kitchen.    On her return, she brought water for the other table.  She went to the back service area, by the door to the outdoor dining, where she took out her compact and proceeded to powder her nose.  After that, she reapplied her lipstick.  She went to the kitchen and returned with my salad.  It appears the kitchen prepares their papaya ahead of time and the green beans are incorporated into the salad then.  The chef picked out the larger pieces of green bean, but what remained was lots of small pieces of chopped up green bean in the salad.  Portion size was discouraging, about 1 cup of salad on top of 2 cups of chopped lettuce, and while there was no mention of carrots in the salad, there was more carrot than there was papaya.  Rice was about 3/4 of a cup and apparently near the bottom of the pan.  It was dry and sticky.  The spice on the salad rated a 2.  I asked the waitress for more chile and lime.  She told me they were out of lime, but I could have lemon instead.  I repeated the request for chile, advising that lemon would not be an adequate substitute.  She returned with some chili.  I sprinkled this on my salad, but it was of no benefit.   While Som Tom should have accents of fish sauce, lime, palm sugar and chile, I tasted no sweet or lime.  The chile was disappointing.    Probably the worst part of the experience was the dirty table next to mine.  It was never cleared while I was at the restaurant.    After bringing me the chile for my order, the waitress went to the back service area and again applied powder and lipstick, then she brought the order to the other table.  She did not clear the table next to mine, nor did she offer to refill my water, though I was at the bottom of the glass.  This place may, as I have heard, have great drink prices for happy hour and cheap munchies for the same, but the salad and rice I received were certainly not the focal point of the chef.  I am doubting I will try this place again, as it seems to be all about the Happy Hour crowd.

I purchased a rosemary focaccia dough from this store.    Following the instructions on the focaccia, including poking holes and allowing dough to rest before baking and after baking, I baked the dough at the appropriate temperature for the recommended time only to find the bread was hardly near ready.    The wrapper suggested 15 minutes at 400 degrees...but at 20 minutes, I pulled the bread out.    Not done...and hardly salvageable since I cooled the bread  for 20 minutes after.  Get the instructions right for those of us who trust the instructions, Fresh and Easy.

It's gratifying to find a Thai restaurant and Thai chef in Peoria!  In going to search for housing in Tempe, I made the drive out to Sun City West to visit friends...and we got to discussing our dinner options.  Thai came up and out comes the Yelp Mobile App...where we found Satara 2 1/2 miles from home.  7 PM on a Tuesday, we had no idea if we would arrive to a packed restaurant or if there would be seats available.  We made the run to the restaurant to see one other car in the parking lot.  As I was reminded, folks in Arizona seem to eat early dinner, about 4:30 PM or late, 8-8:30 PM, so we all figured the restaurant would be relaxed.  On entering, we saw one other table seated.    The hostess took us immediately to our table, provided us menus and asked our beverage choice.  We all enjoyed water.  On perusing the menu, we decided on appetizers, specifically Satay, grilled chicken skewers with house peanut and "ajad" cucumber sauce, Popiea Tod, which are vegetable spring rolls with sweet chili and plum sauce, and last, Poo Tod Ho Cheese, real crab and cheese won tons with plum sauce.  Our waiter came to ask if we were ready, so we ordered the appetizers and advised we would be ready with entree choices in a few moments.    My dining companions asked my impression of the choices on the menu, and then decided.  One ordered Nuea Pad Prik Gaeng Daeng (The herb garden), stir-fried beef with a house blend of Thai herbs, red curry, bell peppers, onions and green beans.  My second companion ordered Googn Op Woon Seen, jumbo prawns with crystal noodles in roasted garlic ginger broth, served with Thai chili lime dipping sauce.  As always, when I am trying a Thai restaurant for the first time, I ordered Som Tom, green papaya salad with tomato, carrots and roasted peanuts.  The offering here also had a jumbo prawn and green beans, but I requested those be left off.  As always, I ordered the salad at 10 spicy.  The waiter asked if I was sure I wanted my salad the hottest it could be made...and I advised I did.  In my reality, 5 spicy makes my nose run, 8 makes my forehead sweat and 10 brings tears to my eyes.  I added a side of steamed rice.    On previous trips to Thailand, I came to accept that a true dinner service should take between 1 and 2 hours, first for the variety of dishes and second because the meal is a social situation to be shared by all.  The longer dinner service is generally found in most Thai households, while Thai restaurant dinner service is generally the shorter service.  Here in the US, Satara is the first restaurant I have experienced that follows the more gradual dinner service.  Our appetizers were brought out one at a time, with the Satay first.  The chicken was grill led on skewers, in a marinade that was sweet and redolent with ginger.  Peanut sauce was a nice compliment, not too thick and not too sticky.  The ajad cucumber sauce did not really strike my taste, but my companions were very pleased with the sauce.  As we finished the last bites of chicken, our waiter came out with Popiea Tod, the vegetable spring rolls with sweet chili and plum sauce.  The wrapper on the spring rolls was very thin.  Inside, cabbage, carrots, glass noodles, rice, garlic and pickled ginger were all evident.  These appeared to be prepared on site and to order, not prepared earlier in the day and stored in the refrigerator.  The sauces made for incredible accompaniment to the rolls.  As we finished our spring rolls, our waiter came out with Poo Tod Ho Cheese, real crab and cheese won tons with plum sauce.  Crab is not something that I enjoy, but to be social, I took a won ton.  My companions were quite impressed with the combination of crab and cheese, and delighted with the plum sauce.  So our first 40 minutes was ordering and then enjoying appetizers.    The Nuea Pad Prik Gaeng Daeng was impressive.  The beef had been stir-fried wonderfully.  It was tender and flavorful, with basil, kaffir lime leaves, shallots, garlic and lemongrass, we suspected, as the Thai herbs.  Red curry, bell peppers, onions and green beans were subtle additions that really brought out the flavors of the herbs.  Googn Op Woon Seen tasted very good as well.  As I am not into jumbo prawns, I did not miss them.  The crystal noodles were well prepared, with the garlic and ginger notes in the broth wonderfully prominent.  The Thai chili lime sauce was a tribute to the wonderfully seductive nature of sweet Thai chili and lime juice.  The Som Tom I was served was a respectably sized portion, about 1 1/2 cups.  On first taste, it hit the 5 spicy spot.  I asked the waiter for more chili and lime, which were provided.  On doctoring the salad, I was only able to achieve 8 hot.  Rice, about 2 cups, was light and fluffy, a great accompaniment to the salad.  I will certainly enjoy Satara, especially now that I am relocating to Tempe!

"No."    If you ask me about eating at Papaya Thai, that is what I will say.   0 stars for the single kinda scattered and scruffy staffperson.    0 stars for the cook who cannot prepare an offering from the menu as the menu describes it.  In this case, I was down to two remaining untried Thai restaurants within quick reach of the Valley Metro Limo, and both in Tempe.  The other half was in Tampa, and since he does not care much for Thai, I get the chance to try one.    The limo arrived at Southern and Mill at 5:17 PM, and connected me with another limo at Broadway. With traffic, getting to McClintock took nearly 15 minutes.  On exiting the limo, 5:50 PM, I walked back about half a block to the restaurant.  On entering the restaurant, I picked up a menu and rang the bell and a somewhat harried staff person came to greet me.  He asked me where I wanted to sit, at a table with 1 bench looking directly into the side of a huge fish tank...or the next table, which would leave no buffer between myself and the only other table seated in the restaurant.    There are at least 120 seats in this restaurant.  Why so fiercely contain people in the first three tables close to the door?  You must get your business in fits and hurries and keeping only the 3 tables active is working for you?  Then again, your telling me you are the only staffperson does not surprise me.  The Help Wanted sign on the door was more than an indication that Help is NEEDED!  When I was seated, staffperson offered to bring water.  The phone rang and he was off, as he offered another version of "I am the only staffperson here..."  I looked at the menu and made my decision. In the menu, there is a $2 charge listed for sharing.  This goes against everything Thai I have ever known.  The traditional Thai meal has everyone enjoying some of each dish served.  Because of my proximity to the fish tank, I was quite up close and personal with the fish. The water probably isn't filthy, but the plexiglass tank is not helping the perception.   6 PM, as the cellphone chime reminds me of the passing of an hour.  I am waiting for water and a staffperson who can take my order. 6:01, the staffperson comes, bearing a pitcher of water and a (My eyes are rolling in opposite directions because I am either overworked or stoned) smile.  He filled up my glass and asked if I was ready to order.  I replied that I was and ordered Som Tom, the Thai name for the green papaya salad. Staffperson replied that he did not know the Thai names for the menu items.  The phone rang again.  Staffperson's attention was no longer on me.  The phone, his Pavlovian stimuli, had taken him away.  I asked if he had heard me.  He replied that he needed to go answer the phone.  He asked if I minded waiting, as he was the only staffperson.  I said I would wait.  Off he went, in pursuit of electronic interaction.    6:10 PM, staffperson returns, apologizing for the telephone delay and asking about my order.  I ordered the papaya salad without the green beans and steamed rice on the side.  Staffperson took the order and went to the kitchen.  The phone rang as he left the table,  his pace quickening as he approached the phone.    6:18 PM, the door opens and 2 potential patrons enter.  The bell rings and staffperson rushes to the waitstand to greet 2 new patrons.    6:20 PM, staffperson returns. He brings the salad and a bowl of rice.  The salad that appears has some of the traditional salad ingredients along with ingredients that have no business being in the salad.  Som Tom does not have cucumber, shredded lettuce or cilantro.  On sending back the initial preparation, staffperson returned with the original preparation, advising the chef stated "This is a traditional Thai presentation of the dish".  I sent the order back, citing the inconsistencies and asking for a new presentation.  6:25 pm.  As I empty my water glass, the salad I received previously is returned, minus the cucumber.  In asking staffperson if this is a new presentation or if it is an attempt to correct the original, he replied that he did not know.  I stood and left.  While the advertisement on the window of the establishment says they have "The Best Curry in the Valley",   they will get no second chance to prove it to me.  For all the phone activity, there was no one who came to pick up a carry-out order.  Between this and the somewhat glazed staffperson, I have to wonder if this place is not a front for a drug business.

I heard ownership changed...and since I was at the cleaners next door, my timing seemed right.  I have since been advised the ownership did not change, only the management.  In entering the NEW front door for Papaya Thai, even though the Open sign is on, I see no one and hear no one.  I walked from the front door to the back but no luck.  I picked up the go menu and was just about to leave when I hear a voice.  Turning to my right, there is an entryway into the Pho restaurant next door.  I asked if the Thai restaurant is open and was advised it is, I would just have a seat at a table in the Pho restaurant.  Between the 32 seats in the Thai restaurant and about 40 in the Pho place, plenty of seats.  I am the only customer in either one...about 3 PM on a Monday afternoon.  Decorations are subtle, everything appears clean.   Hostess/waitress comes by with an order pad and asks what I would like.  I ordered Som Tom, no green beans or shrimp (not listed in the menu, but I have received one or the other too many times) and Thai hot, as it is listed on the menu how I should order.  Hostess did not know the Thai name for the papaya salad (she seems to be Chinese).  I pointed at papaya salad on the menu.  She wrote down my order and headed to the kitchen.  I got out my cellphone and proceeded to update on the news of the world.  A couple minutes later, the waitress called from the kitchen door, asking what I would like to drink.  I requested water and was served water in a glass with a slice of lime in it.  About 10 minutes passed from order to delivery.  A properly prepared Som Tom is made up of julienned green papaya, garlic, fresh tomato, palm sugar, thai rat chile, freshly squeezed lime juice and fish sauce. The salad that appeared has the traditional salad ingredients along with ingredients that have no business being in the salad.  Som Tom does not include cilantro.  This version had the green papaya, fresh tomato and fish sauce.  The chile looked to be red chile from Mexico (the seeds are bigger than thai rat chile) and the zing from the lime was not there.  Portion size was admirable, 2 cups on a lettuce leaf.    Still not worth my time...

it must be my curse misfortune with landlords for rent bad luck marks my choice  Wellnow...how the formerly 3-star review I gave this business has fallen as low as it can.  Because of a new job, we ended our lease in December, 2013.  We went to the office and advised we would be moving, not renewing our lease.  We gave 30 days notice to move out on December 29 as I had to be at work in San Diego on December 30.  The management called and told us we could not move on the 29th, but we could move on January 2, 2014, as the office was not open on Sunday and the holidays had the office closed until January 2.  We told them about the work situation and how we could not stay until January 2 to satisfy their open hours...and they have NO PLACE for someone to drop the keys or pay the rent if the office is not open.  We moved out and mailed the keys to the office.  Fast Forward to March 23, when the US Postal service returned the package we mailed as Undeliverable.  The delivery was attempted 3 times but refused each time.  Now the office is calling and telling me that they are going to take me to a collection agency for the keys.  We have also been advised that the fitness room key (email and ask me more if you want details about THAT space...shudder), which we had to pay $20 deposit for, is nonrefundable.  These folks have some issues with maintenance being hit or miss and the laundry situation needing some help...this does not improve their review standing, obviously.  You want $135 for keys not returned?  We made our attempt, as documented by the Postal Service and our non-delivery confirmation.  See you in court.

With time to spare and other errands in the neighborhood, I made another visit to American Discount Foods.  Better organized, the inventory is apparently all in now.  Store is clean, well lit, kinda barren on the decorations...and the in-store marketing counters for jewelry, grab and go, sodas, etc...leads my mind to the look of an old drugstore with soda fountain and grill that has been closed.    Prices on many things...still astounding.  Layout...well...I have yet to come upon the secret of the way the store is laid out.  It is one of the things that reminds me I am not in a 'corporate' chain store location...where no matter the location of the store, the location of items in the store is 'bout as close to the same as is humanly possible.  This just means a discovery potential on each trip.

In finding myself  at loose ends for nearly a week, I took a trip to Mesa on the suggestion of someone who could previously be trusted for restaurant suggestions (As you say, I cannot tell a lie, Kris...).  Arriving at the restaurant  at 2:20 PM, there were 3 occupied tables that I could see.  One was ordering as I arrived, another was receiving their meal, and the third was well into their entrees.  At the waitstand, I picked up a paper version of their menu.  It is interesting how many restaurants change their prices in the 'table' version of the menu, but they ignore the change in their take away version.  These folks passed the price comparison.  I was greeted by a friendly waitperson.  She brought me to my table, asked about my beverage preference and asked where I would like to sit.  I was seated at a 2-top (though the bench on 1 side apparently means something else in Restauranteeze) and placed my order, Som Tom, no green beans, no shrimp, and Thai hot along with a side of steamed rice.  Because I proceeded out of sequence, my waitperson was not ready; she got her pad and quietly let me know that this was her first day.  She asked me to repeat my order.  I did, and she thanked me for my patience.  Off she went, bearing my order to the kitchen.  She returned in a minute with water.  As I looked around, I counted table and seating space I could see.  18 tables, being for 2 or 4, benches and chairs for about 60 people.  Next time, I will take more time and see if there are other tables.  The plastic carafes full of water...no.  Most looked to be as full as they were when they were placed on the tables at opening.  As I waited for my order, I drained the glass and filled it from the carafe.  If there is any suggestion I would give, please put glass, ceramic or metal carafes out.  Salad and rice arrived.  Nicely sized portions of each, about 1 1/2 cups of rice and 2 cups of salad.  On getting my first forkful of salad, I knew it needed more chile.  When I caught Waitperson's eye, she came over and I asked for more chile.  She said she would get more, turned to go and turned back, asking if I wanted fresh or dried.  This question was the saving grace, preventing a 1-star review.  Waitperson brought out chopped fresh thai chili.  I incorporated this into the salad.  What started as a 2 was now a 6 in heat.  While the papaya seemed fresh, there were lots of bits of green beans.  To me, the better filler is carrot.  The texture is crunchier and the flavor is enhanced.  Probably the biggest challenge was the dressing.  The best Som Tom recipes show hints of garlic, lime, chili, palm sugar and fish sauce.  This version had fish sauce, sugar, chili and bottled lime juice.  It lacked the sparkle that should have gone along with the crunch.  Unfortunately, doctoring Som Tom with chili after the preparation is a marginal adjustment.  Having the chili in with the preparation helps the flavor spread throughout the preparation.    Being spoiled by a native who enjoyed this salad as much as I did, the preparation here does not compare.  I must try Nunthaporn's again for other items.  As of now, 2 stars is the best I can give.

My respect for Wal-Mart has never been high...  What used to be an "All-American" merchandiser has become the predominant "Made in China" merchandiser.  Folks who work here are not paid enough to survive without food stamps.  They cannot afford to pay for company offered benefits.  Regardless, the straw that broke my back was in asking to purchase a roll of quarters.  On walking in to get butter (which was not offered at .99 Cents Only next door), I picked up butter and went to the register.  As I paid out, I requested $20 in change.  When the cashier handed me my change, I asked if I could get a roll of quarters.  I was advised that the register did not keep extra coinage, but I could go to the Customer Service desk to purchase a roll of quarters.  Imagine my surprise when the lead told me there were no quarters in the building.  The assistant manager denied me but after waiting 20 minutes the manager arrived and requested the roll of quarters be brought.  Why tell me I can get what I want if I go to another desk if I cannot.

WooHoo!  Prices are good...produce is fresh...the only thing that keeps me from giving 5 stars is the odor.  The assortment of goods is gratifying.  I found products from Caribbean, Spain, Portugal, the Middle East, Asian and Oriental locales.  The variety is simply outstanding!    In checking out the butcher shop, the seafood offerings appear to be abundant.  Meat and poultry offerings are also extensive.  For the cleanliness of the whole store, I just cannot identify what the odor came from.  It reminds me of walking over the border in Tijuana, but I cannot fathom where the odor would derive.  I will absolutely return, as this market has everything I am looking for.

As a Tempe retread (my initials are still scratched into several corners on Rural from pavement being poured in 1989 and 90), I am rediscovering a few old favorite places and trying many new opportunities.  Last night, Thai Basil had both star earning and star losing moments.  The "Gotta have THAI" monkey popped up on my back early yesterday.  As the love of my life is out of town for a few days and does not have the same passion for Thai that I do, the monkey's timing was good.  Since we are now within Orbit range, I went to my trusty Yelp mobile app and  told it to Thai me.  Thai Basil struck and away I went.  On arriving at 6 PM, there were 5 cars in the lot and on entering, about 20 folks seated at tables enjoying.  The restaurant appears to be clean, though the lighting is dim.  There is apparently a second seating area that I did not explore, so don't hold me to the customer count.  I stood at the door for a moment (in TV terms, a moment is 1 1/2 minutes) and was greeted and seated.  The host handed me a menu and walked away.  I perused the menu for a minute, closed it and started waiting.  5 minutes passed, and I caught the eye of a server who brought appetizers to a table near mine.  She came over and I asked if I could place my order.  She nodded and walked behind the bar, tapped what turned out to be my waiter on the shoulder and pointed at me.  My waiter turned and waved, then walked into the kitchen.  5 minutes later, he came out with his pad and pen.  I ordered Som Tom, the yardstick by which I measure every Thai restaurant, and jasmine rice.  I requested that the green beans and shrimp be left off.  At the menu's suggestion, I ordered Thai Hot.  He wrote down the order and walked away.  I was surprised that there was no request for a beverage order.  I caught the eye of the server again.  She came over and I asked if I could get a glass of water.  She nodded and walked behind the bar, tapped my waiter on the shoulder and let him know about my desire for water.  He turned and waved, then walked into the kitchen.  5 minutes later, he came out with my Som Tom, rice and a glass of water.  He asked if I needed anything else, and when I responded no, he walked away.  Som Tom, properly made, should have lime, chile, palm sugar and fish sauce each of which brings tangy, sweet, salty and spicy notes with the crunch of fresh papaya.  While the portion size was respectable, 2 cups of salad, the seasoning was totally off.  There was no fish sauce or lime that I could detect.  The spice came in at a solid 9 (5 makes my nose run, 8 makes my forehead sweat and 10 brings tears to my eyes), but without all the notes, this was a bad karaoke version of what should be a great song.  I put my fork down and caught my waiter's eye.  He waved, then walked into the kitchen.  5 minutes later, he came to the table and asked if everything was satisfactory.  When I replied to the negative, he said he was sorry and walked into the kitchen.  A moment later, a lady came to the table and asked about my dissatisfaction.  I asked about missing ingredients in the salad.  She grabbed a fork and tasted, then she said it was very sweet.  She offered to have the order remade.  I agreed, and she took the salad to the kitchen, yelling in Thai that it was not right.  I nibbled on rice and sipped water while the order was remade.  The rice was OK, not too sticky and not too dry.  On the second presentation, the lady (who I found out is the manager) asked me to taste this version.  I tasted, and it was a saltier version of the original.  I could get the sweet, the fish sauce and the spice, but no lime.  I asked if I could get some wedges of lime and she said she would take the order back and have it remade.  By this point, it had been nearly an hour since I had arrived, so I asked for the order to go.   I finished the rice and water while I waited.  Instead of bringing the new order out to the table, the manager waved me over to the bar with a go box.  She had me taste and again, it was below par.  I asked for some lime on the side, only to discover it was juice out of a bottle.  I paid my check and proceeded home.  For the price, $8.95, the time and the multiple attempts, this Thai Basil is not worth the effort.  The contrasts between Thai Basil on University and Thai Basil on Rural are kind of strange.  As I have been made aware, there are 5 Thai Basil operations around the Valley...and being an adventurous sort, I will probably try them all.

It hurts to write a 1-star review for this restaurant.  That being said, do not alter a time-honored and familiar recipe.  There is nothing wrong with an addition to the  recipe, as the additions can be requested left out of the order.  However, it is wrong to replace ingredients that make up the basic presentation of the recipe.  This afternoon, I found myself in Mesa for a shopping trip  to Mekong Supermarket.  We have a potluck event coming up at work and I wanted to scope out the place ahead of time for the ingredients I will need.  Seeing the sign for Thai Spices, the trip offered a chance to stop for lunch after I checked out Mekong Supermarket.  On entering the establishment around 1:30 PM, I observed a clean dining room, with a pleasant ambience.  On picking up the 'take it home' version of the menu, I read through and saw what appeared to be suitable offerings for a Thai restaurant.  As always, I looked for Som Tom, green papaya salad, the yardstick by which I measure all  Thai restaurants.  Finding green papaya salad listed, I was gratified.    With no indication whether I should seat myself or wait, I waited.  From entering to being greeted and offered a table, it was about 5 minutes.  There were about 10 people seated in the restaurant, so the wait was, in my perception, reasonable.  When the host came to me, he asked if I would prefer their table menu.  I responded that I found what I wanted, and I would like to be seated.    As I was guided to a table, the host advised I would see my wait person shortly.  He asked what I would like for my beverage and was quick to bring the water with lime I requested.  My waitress arrived shortly after and asked what I would be ordering.  I placed my order for papaya salad, omitting shrimp and long beans, served Thai Hot, along with an order of steamed jasmine rice.  The waitress asked if I could clarify my order, hot being 1-5.  I requested 6.  She wrote down the order and asked if I wanted another beverage in addition to the water.  I declined, and she went to the kitchen, advising I could anticipate a wait of 7-10 minutes for my order.  Sipping water, I waited for my order to arrive.         My order was presented at about 8 minutes.  The salad looked to be reasonable, about 2 cups and the rice about 1 cup.  Som Tom, properly made, should have lime, chile, palm sugar and fish sauce, each of which brings tangy, sweet, salty and spicy notes with the crunch of fresh papaya.    On tasting the salad, I got lime, vinegar , garlic and spicy notes.  The spice was about 5 on a scale of 10 (5 makes my nose run, 8 makes my forehead sweat and 10 brings tears to my eyes).  I caught the waitress' eye and when she came to the table, she asked if everything was satisfactory.  I told her that the salad was missing some ingredients, specifically fish sauce and palm sugar.  She apologized and took the order back to the kitchen.  3 minutes later, she returned with the same order, though it had been doctored with fish sauce and granulated sugar.  The chef had not remixed or even replated the order, only put fish sauce and granulated sugar on top of the previous order.  I asked the waitress to return this version to the kitchen and requested a new presentation be made, without the vinegar.  She went to the kitchen and returned with the same plate, telling me that the chef would not make a new order.  I asked for the bill, and requested consideration as the order I wanted was not what I anticipated.  The waitress apologized and asked if I wanted to speak with the manager.  In replying that I would, she said the manager would meet me at the register.  I went to the register and on asking for consideration, the manager advised me that the salad was prepared exactly to my order, with no beans and no shrimp.  When I asked why vinegar was used instead of fish sauce, she said "That is how it is listed in the menu.  Did you not see that?"  I paid my bill and left.  Oh, I have regrets...yes, I have many regrets.

This State Farm agent and his employees have certainly let me down.  We started our shopping for insurance on January 3.   After fielding numerous offers, the best price for the coverage we searched for came from State Farm in Scottsdale.  While other State Farm agencies replied as well, Shelbi at this agency knocked everyone else down with her outstanding ($388 for 6 months) price.  I guess I should have started to worry when I received another 'We have a great price for you' email from Shelbi, which felt like she had no awareness it was being sent.   This one quoted the same coverage for $560 for 6 months.     I replied to the email offering $388.  Over the next 15 days, Shelbi and I emailed back and forth, my providing drivers' license numbers and the VIN number.  As we already have renters coverage under another company, I asked about the price of the policy without the renters coverage, and Shelbi advised we would pay $439.00.  Finally, January 15, Shelbi asked about my payment.  I asked if we could complete everything online or if she required a signature.  She replied that we could complete the transaction online.  I emailed the credit card information.  For the next 3 days, I was again asked for the credit card information and sent it again and again.  Finally, on the 19th, the date coverage was to commence, I received yet another email requesting my payment information.  Replying again, I got an autoresponse that Shelbi was out of the office through the following Monday.  If I had concerns, I could call the 800 number for State Farm customer care.    11:30 PM, when I read the email, I came to the realization that I had been driving all day uninsured.  I called the 800 number and asked the representative if I could pay for my insurance with him.  He searched me up in his system and said he found my $560 for 6 months coverage quote.  I asked him to search again, as I was quoted $439.  He tipped and tapped a second and confirmed he found the right quote.  He asked me for a credit card.  I started to provide my American Express number, only to be told that State Farm does not accept American Express.  OK...I got the MasterCard out and gave the number.    Once processing was completed, the representative said "The quote you had has actually gone up a little.  It's $455.86, and you are covered."  I asked when I would receive my proof of insurance documents, only to be told "It will take a couple of days".  I asked if something could be sent to me by email, and the representative said "We don't usually do business that way".  I reminded him that I had driven a full day with no insurance, and it would not be acceptable to wait 2 more days to be legal.  He asked his manager, and I received my proof of insurance email a moment later.  I called the office the following morning.  The 'agent', Dusty, was unavailable, as was Shelbi.  I asked for a call back from the agent.  Next, I called Geico.  They got me the same coverage for $51 less in 15 minutes.  After I got my proof of coverage email from Geico, it was time to call and cancel State Farm.  Chris, the representative who answered my phone, wanted to ask questions about why I would cancel my just-purchased coverage.  I replied that I would answer his questions as soon as he cancelled my coverage.    Once cancelled, he asked what changed about my satisfaction.  I told him the price changed 3 times, and I drove around for a day uncovered.  He wanted to ask other questions, and I renewed my request for Dusty, the agent, to call me back.  I called at 9:15 AM and did not get a call back from Dusty until 2 PM.  NEVER AGAIN!

I am flabbergasted!  There is no other way to put it.  'Ol Dusty has gone and put me in his tickler file.    I just opened an envelope from his office. The name is correct, the mailing address is not. Not very classy to leave off the suite number, Dusty.  You must be nuts if you think you are ever going to have my business.    As I have notified your office, I will reiterate here:Take me off your mailing list.  You are wasting paper, ink and a stamp.

Joann, your restaurant is improving!  On Wednesday, I returned to Thai Buffet and American Sandwiches.  Joann, her daughter and a new kitchen 'ho all made their appearance.  The shabby chic assortment of tables and chairs has been replaced.  Joann has installed booths and gotten matching chairs for the free-standing tables.  Joann's daughter, the waitress, is looking more professional in her dress, as well.    When I walked in, Joann greeted me, telling me she was in anticipation of my return. I brought her a julienne peeler for Som Tom, as the previous experience had appeared to have papaya that was processed by a shredder.  Her daughter asked me where I would like to sit and I took one of the booths.  She asked me what my beverage preference would be and brought me the water I requested expediently.  On offering the buffet, I went over to see curry and chicken wings that interested me, alongside noodles and chicken that did not offer any appeal, as they looked dried out.    I put the curry and wings on my plate.  As I sat down, Joann came out and asked me if I was ready for Som Tom.  She remembered my spice preference and said she would have my salad ready soon.  The curry...perfect!  The wings...adequate, as they were not fried but baked.    Som Tom was brought to the table, and, as requested, it was 10 hot (5 makes my nose run, 8 makes my forehead sweat and 10 brings tears to my eyes).  Joann asked if I wanted soup, and when I said yes, she headed to the kitchen.  I reveled in the glory of finding a well-made green papaya salad and thanked her profusely as I dabbed my eyes with my napkin when she brought me the most incredible Thom Kar Gai.    When she brought the soup, she asked if I would like a noodle dish.  I asked her for the Pad See Eau with chicken and she was off to the kitchen.  I went after the soup with a gusto  The temperature was great, the flavors intense and the chicken wonderful.  Shortly after I finished the soup, the Pad See Eau with chicken arrived.  I greatly enjoyed the dish, with every bite singing.  As I was finishing the dish, daughter waitress approached and asked if I was ready for dessert.  Stuffed as I was, I declined with regret.  Joann came out and asked if I liked the changes to her restaurant.  The only thing I could reiterate was that she should get rid of the Coca Cola menu board.  She replied that since she was not carrying the Coca Cola product (the sales guy said she had to order at least 10 cases a week for a discount), it would not be difficult to replace.    If you find yourself in Mesa and that little "Gotta have Thai" demon pops up on your shoulder, head for Joann at Thai Buffet and American Sandwiches.  It will be the smartest decision you can make!

It was difficult to get past the smell of the place when I opened the front door.  Growing up in oil and cattle country, the only thing I could compare the faint odor that I experienced when opening the front door was standing in a field where there was an oil well next to a feedlot.  Between the smell of manure and fresh oil, the combination is vivid and unforgettable.  Unfortunately, this was what greeted me when I walked into Tasty Thai.  I had placed an order for Som Tom, Thai hot, and an order of jasmine rice to go.   The papaya salad had all the requisite notes, lime, chile, spicy and sweet...the portion size was respectable, 2 cups of salad and 1 cup of rice...the spice came in at about 5 (makes my nose run , while 8 makes my forehead sweat and 10 brings tears to my eyes) and the rice was OK, not too sticky and not too dry.  I want to give this place higher marks because the waitress was great...and the chef came out to say hello...but that smell just took about all the desire I had for Som Tom out of my evening.  Gotta hope this changes!

The food I received certainly did not justify the price.    Sunday about 4 PM, I was finished with my errands and made the decision to try wings from Poppy's.  It's close to home, so I ordered 10 chicken wings, heat level fire and add garlic, to go.  $9.49, paid, and I found a seat to sit and watch the game on one of the numerous tv screens in the place (there must be at least 20...)  With so many screens to look at, there were only two choices showing: Football (which received the blessing of both audio and closed captioning) or a movie (which played on about every 4th screen, silently).  Wings took about 15 minutes, as I was told when I placed my order.  The guy from behind the register walked them out to me and set 'em down.  I looked at wings and back at him and reminded him I ordered to go.  He carried  the order back to the kitchen.  5 minutes later, the wings appeared in a takeout box.  I picked up the order and headed home.  On arriving home (3 blocks from the restaurant), I opened the box anticipating spicy steam.  It was quite disappointing, the lack of both types of heat.    I took a bite of the first wing only to discover the very mild sauce on the wings.  In looking at the receipt, I saw the Fire level was specified and the garlic I ordered on the wings came with a charge, but the cook must have either not read the ticket or misread it.  In addition to a wing sauce with very little kick, there was no garlic.  The final indignity: the wings were small.  The whole order, box, dressing, celery and wings weighed 14 ounces.  Wings that could not make the trip 3 blocks and still be steaming...the wrong sauce...and leaving off something you charged me for...it's highly doubtful that your restaurant will get a second chance to make a first impression.

Dive bar...I think not.  Bar that people have tended to forget...I think so.  20 years ago, this was the midpoint between my residence and ASU.  Back in the day, the drinks were strong, the food was from the restaurant on the corner or across the street at Arco.  Today, I walked in hoping to find football, food and beer.  I found a bartender and 2 other patrons.  11:15 AM, games are already on...and there are several posters touting cheap beer during games.  I ordered a PBR and asked about ordering food only to be told that the cook has not yet arrived nor called in.    11:30 AM, I have finished my first beer and asked for a second.  Still no word about a cook.    11:45 AM, I have finished my second beer and I am ready to pick up and go when someone breezes through the front door and announces they have arrived.  Looking quizically at the bartender, he says she's the cook.  She proceeds to take her coffee behind the bar, fix it with cream and sugar and chat with the bartender for a few minutes...then she's off to the kitchen where I presume she is getting everything turned on.  12 PM...the bartender returns and asks me if I need another beer.  Another $2 PBR is set in front of me.  The cook comes out and asks what I would like to order.  I let her know I want a pound of wings, as hot as she can make them.  She asks if I want the wings grilled and I reply that I don't care how they are cooked, as long as they are physically hot and spicy when they are put in front of me.  12:15 PM...I've polished off the latest PBR and wings have not been put in front of me.  I ask for another PBR and state that if the wings are not done before I am done with the beer, I am going to head out.    12:24 PM...I am presented with wings.  I take a taste and ask for tabasco.  The cook asks if they are not spicy enough, and I reply that if they were, why would I ask for tabasco?  She scuttles back to the kitchen.  I've been careful to pay for each round and the wings when they are presented.  I've also been careful to tip exactly 10%, as this is not the service I would want and certainly not what I remember.  You want football, wings and beer?  You can do better than this.

Your restaurant needs more help!  Lunchtime at your restaurant, the tables stay full.  Your 3 servicepeople are overwhelmed.  Do them a favor...hire someone to provide water service and clear tables.  Somehow, you are not realizing that keeping your customers serviced while turning tables is a bigger job than you are staffed for.  I arrived at 11:45 AM to find every table seated except the token 2-top right against the front window, which I occupied.  With approximately 30 tables, my guesstimate is that there is room for about 100 people in the restaurant.  I waited a few minutes before my waiter brought out the menu and asked about my beverage choice.  Returning with water in plastic with a slice of lemon, he asked if I was ready to order.  On advising I was, he asked what I wanted.    My order was for Som Tom, green papaya salad made Thai hot, and leave the green beans off, along with a bowl of steamed rice.  The waiter did not know the Thai name for green papaya salad, so he was going to open the menu when I told him what Som Tom is.  He repeated back my order, with no Thai hot and no steamed rice.  I repeated the order, which he still did not write down and again he missed the Thai hot.  The third repeat from me got an accurate verification from the waiter.  He headed off toward the kitchen.  After about 10 minutes, my salad appeared, sans rice.  I figured he would bring the rice shortly, so I sampled the salad  A properly prepared Som Tom is an artwork that brings flavors of sweet, sour, salty and spicy together in a harmonious combination that allows each to sing.  There should be clearly definable notes of lime, fish sauce and garlic in the mixture, with the sweet coming from tomato and palm sugar in the salad.  I got notes of salty (fish sauce) and sweet (granulated sugar, not palm) but the spice, lime and garlic were not there.   When I placed my order, I asked for Thai Hot.  Sometimes, it works and sometimes it does not.  On my initial sampling of the salad, I evaluated the spice level at about 2 (5 makes my nose run, 8 makes my forehead sweat and 10 brings a tear to my eyes).  After sampling, I put my fork down and spent 10 minutes trying to get any serviceperson's attention.  One waitress looked my way and I waved her over, asking about the rice I ordered and requesting that she bring chile and a lime to the table.  She took my order back to the kitchen and after about 5 minutes,  she returned  from the kitchen with my salad and rice.  I looked at the same preparation, though there was what appeared to be more fresh chopped Thai chile.  The 'updated salad went from a spice level of 2 to a spice level of 3.  While my salad was being adjusted, another couple came and sat at a table near mine.  The waiter came by and asked about beverages, which they ordered.  As a side-note, it took my flagging down the waiter nearly 10 minutes later to ask for water and to point out that he had apparently forgotten about the other table, as they had no water and had not placed an order.  Another table nearby finished and a waitress came by to pick up the tip.  She did not immediately clear the table, but she sure wanted the tip.  It was nearly 5 minutes before she returned to clear the table.  Portion size on the salad was about 1 cup, small  for the price.  Normally, Som Tom is served either on a cabbage leaf or with a wedge of cabbage.  This version was served in a lettuce leaf with shredded carrot (about 2 tablespoons) on the side.  The rice bowl, which was $2 was also about 1 cup.    It was certainly a struggle deciding between 1 and 2 stars...though I finally decided on one.  Between long waits, no beverage service unless I requested it, no rice being brought with the order and inability to even come close to the desired spice level, your restaurant did not satisfy.  I hear there are 2 other Thai restaurants within the same block, so after I try the other two, I may return.

I should heed the warning...don't go to sandwich shops for their anniversary special!  Schlotzskys has turned 40...and they had an offering of a small original sandwich for $1.99.  In the growing up years, Schlotzskys held a special place in my world.  Their bread was fresh, their toppings generous and the fact that they were one of the first restaurants to grill their sandwiches, they were unique.  From age 12-18, my birthday dinner desires were all fulfilled at Schlotzskys.  Fast-forward 2 decades...  The original sandwiches are still available.   The location in Tempe, unfortunately, is closed for a remodel.  Discovering this, I returned home to look up another location.  The tossup between 44th and Thomas and Warner and Alma School...!  As I'm at Baseline and Mill, the biggest consideration was traffic.  At 7 PM on a Tuesday, I figured the run east would be easier.  I drove...and got to the store 7:20 PM.  On walking in, while the exterior of the location is kind of dark, the interior certainly works.  Recessed lighting, the feeling of faux rustic in appetite-stimulating colors...tables full of folks eating many discounted sandwiches...it felt like a good location for serious sandwich aficionados.  When I got to the register, the guy before me had been courteously rejected when he asked to order 10 of the discount sandwiches to go.  In placing my order with the manager/owner? I requested 3 small originals (the offering advertised).  My preference for the jalapeno cheddar bread was greeted with an expression of relief.  Other customization: no lettuce, extra onion, extra olive and add jalapeno on each.    10 minutes later, my sandwiches are bagged and ready.  Driving home, the aroma of toasted bread and warm meat, along with savories tempted me to dig into the bag.  I resisted, as this was dinner for me and mine.  Arriving at home, I brought the conquest in.    Unwrapping the first, I observed no jalapeno or cheese on the bread.  On taking a bite, there was no indication of significant onion, olive or jalapeno.  Lowering the sandwich and taking the top off was a disappointment.  1 slice of tomato, a scattering of onion and olives, and no jalapeno.  The receipt showed the order correctly, but the end result did not match.  After the unfortunate discovery, I called the restaurant.  As the person who answered had a very thick hispanic accent, I knew I was not talking to the manager/owner, who is working to lose her Brooklyn accent.  I asked for the manager, and on she came.  In advising the sandwiches are incorrect, she asked me to return the sandwiches...so she could make it right.  I advised that this would be 40 minutes round-trip, and I would not be back in the neighborhood until next week.  She suggested I freeze the incorrect product and bring it when I get into the neighborhood...she will make it right.  I appreciate the effort to fix an order that's wrong...so I will return the remaining incorrect sandwiches.  Here's to hoping I can upgrade this review from 2 stars...!

They made it right!  I took the incorrect sandwiches back to the store.    The manager took them out of the bag,  verified the wrong bread and missing toppings, then she went back and made the two sandwiches again, with the right bread and toppings.  She also upsized from the small, which was the anniversary special, to medium.

While I must recognize that when I buy produce in a discount store, I must be extra vigilant, I have been bitten twice even after rooting through each choice in the bin.  When I come to this store, I am looking for 3 things...garlic, onions and spices.  I have yet to be disappointed by any spices I have purchased in this store, but I have been burned buying garlic and onions on the last occasion.    The garlic bulbs in their 5 for 99 cents sleeve are generally good.  They are more expensive than the same offering at any respectable oriental grocery, but the location is closer.  The last occasion, I found that all 5 bulbs had begun to rot, to turn from the nice cream color to an opaque tan that tells me these apparently reached a temperature of over 90 degrees while in storage.  The onions I purchased on the same trip appeared to suffer the same fate.  The outer skin looked good, but on cutting in, I found translucent layers.  Peeling through the layers, the heat apparently permeated more than half-way through the onions.    I get that shopping for discount produce is a risk.  I do not respect the company that promises low prices and respectable items.  The company needs to regard minimum standards for their products.  You have lost my business.  I can only wonder about other items that came in on the same shipment, be they produce, candy or other consumables.

Soot on my pizza, a register Chickie who is too young to serve a beer...  I stopped for a slice...great prices...good sauce...outstanding crust and toppings...BUT YOU GOT SOOT ON MY CHEESE!  Because of your airport location and the number of people always in line, as well as my getting the slice to go so I had something to eat on the plane, I was unable to take the slice back and show it to someone who could do something about it.  Your prices are very fair, your pizza certainly has potential...anything you can do to educate the person who got soot on my pizza will help.  Yer gonna save yourself a WHOLE lot of time and gain more customers if you get someone old enough to pour a beer to run the register.  That way, the folks who order a beer can pay, get their beer and receipt and clear the register to help the next customer.  Having to wait while the cashier gets someone old enough to pull a beer is not an effective use of time or personnel...
