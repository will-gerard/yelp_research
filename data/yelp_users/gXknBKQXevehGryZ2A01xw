Great little shop! I just needed a quick watch link removal and walked in and it was done in 5 min. No big store hustle and bustle. They repair clocks and jewelry of all kinds as well. Friendly, courteous and knowledgable. I plan to go back to fix my grandmothers watch next.

Their posole is amazing & spicy! Wings are great! Music is a tad too loud when trying to carry on conversations but all in all great food & atmosphere.

Always accommodating and kind. They offer water or soda and the place is always clean. There's about 20 pedi chairs and even a few kid chairs. Can't go wrong here. And Tina is great on your nails!

This place is amazing. We had the filet and others had chicken but nobody was dissatisfied. Atmosphere incredible. Service was spectacular. Price is up but if you're on Vaca or want a nice dinner it was well worth every penny.

I love this place! Hands down beats any mystic tan you can possible get out there.  You get a perfectly even tan and it lasts quite a long time.  Donna is who I see and she is definitely great at her craft.  I used to have a person come to my house and spray tan me and when they decided to close their "side" business I was stuck and didn't know where to go.  I am beyond pleased I have found Arizona Airbrush Studio, Super impressed - I recommend this place to everyone looking.

Not sure this is worthy of any stars. 2 lousy slices of meat as opposed to 3-4. I figured I'd load up on veggies since I was getting ripped off. He grabs a hand full of black olives and gives me 3. I'm like you can add more he says I'm not supposed too. But gives me 2 more. So kind. So I say ok extra pickles. I got 3. I'm said 3 is extra? He said yes. Didn't give me dressing and didn't bag the sub. Get outta here. Ridiculous. Don't go to this subway. I should have remembered how bad this location was.

Service lacking. Waited almost an hour at lunch to sit  - ordered as soon as we sat down - an app and all our meals. Our drinks came 10 min later. The guacamole came 20 min after that - and by guac I mean an ice cream scoop of it and about 10 chips. Then the food came 30 min after that. Nobody checked on us. We didn't like the turkey club but there was nobody to tell. Then we sat w plates for about 15 min waiting for our check. So arrival 11:35 and didn't finish until nearly 2. On a work day. It's no wonder it takes an hour to sit when every table is there forever on a workday lunch. Our food a disappoint and won't know if anything else is good cause I won't be returning. 4 people was $80 no alcohol pretty pricey for the "Henry" experience.

Hands down Lizy and her team are all amazing! My husband and I are first time home buyers and Lizy went out of her way to explain the entire process so we knew exactly what to expect. She never failed to call with new updates, answer all our endless questions and make sure we were comfortable with every step. I would definitely recommend her team to anybody looking for a mortgage broker.

This was our 4th visit and it never disappoints! I had the bbq burger which I've had before and it's PHENOMENAL! The sourdough bread is lightly buttered & toasted to perfection, they add green chilies, crispy bacon all to make a great flavor combo! I love that they change parts of the menu every 3 months with 'season changes' to keep it fresh & worthy of returning to experience more. The buffalo chicken wrap sauce is to die for - which they toss in garlic, cilantro & lime juice into the buffalo sauce - truly adds a whole new flavor setting. Individually owned, modern/urban style restaurant gem - I would love to see this place thrive.
