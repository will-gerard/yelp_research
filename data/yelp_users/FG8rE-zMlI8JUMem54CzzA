First off, try the kimchi!  I'd give Hodori five stars, because the food is really great. What ruined it for me was the service. The server, whose name escapes me, was very short with us; maybe it was an off day, but I don't know if that's really a valid reason. We're not a very demanding party of two, so we were a bit thrown off.  Despite that minor setback, the bbq chicken and bbq ribs were take-home-for-leftovers worthy. Which is good, because you definitely pay for your portion. Go during lunch, which I believe ends at 3. Half-price meals, which still totals about $12 a person!

Great food, but maybe they didn't have enough staff to accommodate the amount of guests.

Thai restaurants seem to be popping up everywhere but this spot is really the best. The staff is extremely friendly and even during peak lunch/dinner hours they ensure drinks are never left empty.   The food is crazy delicious. The thai basil pork is one of my favorites or the seafood pad-see-ew (also great with chicken).

I was sold on this gym as soon as I walked in and saw the iPod plugs on the elliptical. You can either plug your iPod in so that it's charging while you're exercising, or you can plug your earphones in and watch tv. I get SUPER BORED on ellipticals, so this is perfect for me because it really helps pass the time.  The classes are well-taught, and are taught late enough to be able to get to them after work. I LOVE the Yoga classes, definitely very relaxing.  The only con about this place is how busy it gets. Lots of muscle-bound college kids and if you go right before or right after work you'll probably be waiting around for a free machine.  Oh, and strangely enough, a lot of the free weights go missing. Sometimes it's really difficult to find a pair.

This locally owned smoke shop was surprisingly opened late as I needed to grab a pack of elements after leaving a nearby bar. They had a variety of options for me to choose from and the staff was very helpful.   The shop can be seen off the main road but parking is located in the back. I only knew because i was next door at yucca.   They do not offer discounts to marijuana card holders but I haven't found a headshop in Az that does.

Of course, everyone loves themselves some In-N-Out Burger!  Service: Quick, efficient service! I always see lines dozens of cars deep, so I have definitely sat in a 20 minute line to satisfy an intense In-N-Out craving before... however we ventured inside this time and had our food within 5 minutes.  Tip: Supposedly you should ask about a secret menu, which entails something called "Animal Style", which is a really saucy-grilled-oniony version of the original. So if you like that, go balls to the wall. Apparently you can get your french fries Animal Style too, which actually sounds pretty good.  Location: This particular location was a real mess. Dirty tables everywhere, crap all over the floors. Real shame too, because there were employees just standing around most of the time.
