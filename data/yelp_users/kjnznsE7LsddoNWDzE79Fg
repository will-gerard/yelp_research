Made an appt for an oil change and had to call a few times to change the time. I spoke with Seth who I'm not sure if he was the manager or owner but he was incredibly nice and helpful.   When I went into the store he was there and just as professional and kind in person. I was in an out for the oil change in less than an hour and the store itself was clean and well kept. Will definitely be going back!

Love, love, LOVE this place! Always helpful and very professional. Family owned and quick turn around time with your services.  I orginally found this through a Groupon ad they were offering for an oil change special and I have been going back for a few years now for all my services and new tires. The people who own this are honest, hard working and very quick. I will never go anywhere else for my car care.

From the service down to the food, this place has NEVER failed me. Every single time I have been here and brought new people with me, we all leave incredibly impressed and full might I add.   I discovered this place a while ago and while I live in Central Phoenix (a good 35 mile drive) I still venture out AT LEAST once a month for a taste of the delicious freshly prepared food! The entire staff is friendly and helpful, making you feel at home and welcome. The food is always incredible and big enough portions to share.   A few of my own suggestions on "must haves"  salt river bar- omg amazing griddled bread pudding- delicious veggie scramble- I add chicken because I am not a vegatrian but the goat cheese and combo of everything is simply to die for  For lunch try the rancher, amazing!

First time going to this place and I was very happy!  I went in for a pedicure and was out in 35-40 minutes and the service was friendly and fast! Its right by my house and seemed to have a really inviting atmosphere, will for sure go back again!

This place while it is in quite a scary part of town, is simply to die for!!!! If you're a fat kid at heart like myself you have to try these donuts!   The employees are always friendly and quick and the donuts themselves are AH-MAZING.   I have to try and convince myself not to go here every morning to chow down on the warm, freshly made sugary donuts!   Try this place!!!

Great food, very clean bar and AWESOME emoployees!!!   My boyfriend and I love to come here for a cold beer and delicious food. Yes its bar food but its always delicious and cooked just the way we order it. The stafff is always friendly and fast with service and make you feel right at home.   There are so many bars out there these days that dont take pride in their food and only focus on the alcohol side of the business but Lucky Lou's cares about it all!  Love this place, we are regulars and will continue to be!!

My first time here and I have to say, it did not live up to its expectations. From the moment we got there, the hostess was rude and when I asked if they could turn the air up before my friend turned into a popsicle, we were declined. I then asked if we could turn the fan off right above us and she still said no without any explanation. I ordered the shrimp enchiladas and I would say there was MAYBE three pieces of shrimp in the entire dish.   Splitting up the check was a nightmare since we were told they dont do seprate checks , she came over probably every two minutes to make sure we were moving along in the bill splitting process. It was not relaxing, enjoyable or worthwhile. It was a going away dinner for one of my friends and I was sad to say that upon leaving, I knew she wasn't thrilled with the service or the food.

I am so addicted to this place. Luckily I dont live close (i would go there for every meal) and only make trips here when I am at my boyfriends house on that side of town but everytime we go,  the food is delicious!  I would give it 5 stars but the service is my only downfall with this place. I have never really had a "great" server whenever I go and dine. The service is usually slow and the person that waits on us always seem really tired and out of it. However, their salad and homemade bread is simply amazing.   If you go, you must try their espresso pie as a dessert (thank me later).. its incredible!!!

Ive been there now a few times for yoga and really love the classes. I dont think that I have sweat that much in a yoga class EVER...the instructors are awesome and do a good job at not making the newbies (me) feel bad if I cant get every pose at first try.  The music is always upbeat and fun, the staff at the front are super sweet and helpful and it overall has a great vibe inside. A little on the pricey side in my opinion for their single sessions but Ive been willing to pay.  I cant talk highly enough about the food and smoothies in the SEED cafe.. oh my god. Amazing... If you dont go for a work out, at least go try the delicious food!!!

Ive been going here since before Donna took over when it was Studio Glo (the business is in much better hands now). Every time I have left as a happy and satisfied customer. Donna and her staff are incredibly professional and always seek to have amazing results!  Each staff member makes you feel very comfortable and customizes each tan to the color you prefer. I always get a ton of compliments on my tans after and the prices are very reasonable as well.  Go here before anywhere else!!!

I have eaten here before and at the Central Phoenix location and was a little surprised how rude the staff were.  My friends and I went in Friday night for drinks and appetizers and asked to be seated outside. She took us to a far corner table off by ourselves on the front patio that was covered in dirt. We then asked to move inside and she shoved us in the very corner booth by the kitchen where we were almost hidden from the entire restaurant when there were plenty of other booths and tables open.   Our actual server was very nice but it honestly took incredibly long to simply get a drink refill on our water, chips and salsa. They were not that busy, it just seemed due to the seating location we were so hidden and off by ourselves he kept forgetting about us.   After we finished the food the plan was to hang out and order a few drinks until we decided where else to go. Another server came over immediatley and dropped the bill. He then came back three or four times to check and see if we had placed the cards in there yet. I dont get why servers do this. IT IS SO RUDE. We werent in a hurry, they werent busy at all, we werent bothering anyone but yet they made us feel like we were a complete burden by being there. Ordering $7.00 drinks x4 and food and minding our own business I wouldnt think to be a hassle of a table.   Im only giving them two stars for the food because thats been on point every time I have been there. I used to work for this company when it was jointly owned with the folks from Chelseas Kitchen.. I remember first hand how seriously customer satisfaction was taken while employed with them and am sad to say, they are not carrying on that same mindset to this new concept.

DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE!!!!!  I paid $65.00 for a gel full set...nothing fancy about it what so ever..   What I got was nail polish that peeled off days later and a brand new set of nails that broke two weeks after they were put on.  The place is clean and nice inside but that doesnt give them an excuse to give cheap service and up charge for it.

This place is fantastic! Food tastes homemade and spectacular, chicken and waffles is to die for.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the staff isn't too friendly. They usually seem annoyed that it's super busy (which it has been everytime I've been there) other than that- I love this place!

Seriously addicted to this place.  What an amazing concept of the fast casual pizza place that has great topic choices and more than two types of cheeses!! I love that you can literally load on the topics for the build your own choice and they dont charge extra. The people are always friendly and personable even if they are in the middle of the hectic lunch rush!  Love this place, the food and the concept!

Honestly, I am so so so disappointed in this take over from Darque Tan. I actually wrote Palm Beach a personalized letter about their staff ,  the horrible service and HORRIBLE products.... I have YET to hear back...  I use the versa spa tanning which I am not sure why the solution they switched to requires me to literally tan three to four times in a row to get the color I want. I have asked the people that work there why this is and been told "its much more natural looking". No. Its not. It doesnt even look like I got tanned AT ALL. I am paying 50-60 bucks a month for a tanning membership, I would expect to look tan after one time. Also, I lost my ring there and their new policy about having to come into the store to discuss this is insane but I did it anyways and the girl told me she "had no clue where the lost and found was kept and I would have to come back later when someone else was working".  Great, thanks for all your help.   I was soo pleased with Darque Tan I am so sad that Palm Beach has taken over and that the  product and service they provide has gone so down hill.  I cant spread the word enough about how NOT to pick this tanning place to all my friends and family.

I cant say enough good things about this place. I went here on a wimb for a facial on a Friday afternoon and was ready to indulge in the spa services. I have been to plenty of resorts that have a spa but this one BY FAR is the best. The staff are friendly and so helpful, the spa itself is beautiful, there is a perfect pool overlooking the resort, delicous and afforable menu to pick from while youre relaxing, the facial itself was seriously perfect. Kathleen completed my facial and I am going to ask for her everytime I come back! She was so sweet, easy to chat with, really great about offering products to me and so so so kind. I am in love with this place, cant wait to go back!!!

This place is a stones throw away from our house and we were so excited when we discovered it! The service was fantastic, I think she was one of the owners and she was very attentive and pleasant.  The whole concept is cool with the chalk board walls you can write on, the video games and the menu on the walls also. I had a few glasses of wine, my boyfriend had a variety of IPA's and we were very happy with everything. I would add a 5th star if they served more variety of foods to munch on.
