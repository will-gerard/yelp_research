One star for the most terrible service in recent memory.  Our server "DK" was outright rude and horrible, and outright ignored us when she wasn't making us uncomfortable.   As a former waitress of 14 years, I have the utmost respect, patience and tolerance for my former bretheren - but this woman needs to go.  BAD DK!  Otherwise, our Teppiniyaki (sp?) chef was wonderful, the food was delicious and fresh and a solid four stars.  I have been going to Kyoto since 1995 and it remains a fun and festive place with very reasonable prices.  Too bad it was ruined this time by DK!   DK needs a different job, more suited to her personallity, like euthanizing kittens or something.

For the most part, the Grapevine has barely passable food.  HOWEVER thier cheeseburgers are absolutely DEVUBE.  Hand molded, tender, juicy and presented on a whole wheat bun with a dijon mayonnaise and a yummy side of fries.  It really is ridiculously good.   Also, thier patio rules!  It boasts a commanding view of Camelback and you can see the goings on on the street below.    It is great to go for lunch or sunset and If you are a sports fan, they have a few big screen tv's.

Visit #1 Sat night. I called in for a reservation and the guy at the end I the phoneline was very nice.  I had perused the menu online and was very excited to eat here.  Similarly when we arrived the hostess was very nice and Eddie was at the hostess stand keeping vigilant watch on the ebb and flow of the seating and said hello.  Big plus.  Unfortunately it went way downhill when we sat down.  The menu was significantly more expensive than was posted online.  We brushed this off and committed ourselves to paying more as good food is worth it; however,  we sat for 10 minutes without any greeting from a server.  The restaurant was very busy and obviously out of controll, so we left and decided to try another night.  Visit#2  the following sat night. we came in earlier and sat at the bar.  Caesar salad: very small, bland and overpriced.  I ordered a specialty drink which was made all wrong and undrinkable, so I pushed it to the edge  and asked for a wine list.  I was given one but was never given the opportunity to order a glass of wine.  Meanwhile oi lamb chops with mint hummus had arrived - yummy.  Unfortunately, one of my boufriend'a chops were blue raw. After several attempts to get the bartender's attention - I placed it at the edge of the bar on a plate with the blue side showing next to my untouched disgusting drink.  Our bartender (a female) never checked on us, never asked how our meal was - she was 3 -6 feet away almost the whole time!  Really???  Albeit she was busy on service bar, but only had 6 customers.  You know when someone is staring at you and needs something!  Finally, after 15-mins  I flagged down the other bartender (Danny who also happened to be the manager) , explained what had happened, and asked if he could cash us out so we could escape.  He graciously assisted us right away - while he was at the computer the bartender barked that she had already cancelled our order.  This cemented my suspicion that she had been studiously and PURPOSFULLY ignoring us.  Anyway - five stars for Danny, a beacon in our two-visit catastrophe (and the lamb chops that were cooked). Minus four for that evil harpy of a bartender - shame on you!

I have been bringing my Persian cats to Tracy for grooming for years.  She is patient and always does a good job, even though my older cat is horribly behaved (sorry about the scratches).    Thank you Tracy for always taking such good care of my boys!     It is difficult to keep Persians brushed and bathed, and mine will not cooperate.  If you have the same problem, head for Paws Salon!  A shave every 4 months is well worth the money and makes them happy!
