You need to give this place a try!  You need to try the spaghetti pie!   I saw spaghetti pie on the menu  and i really had no idea what that even was.  As it turns out spaghetti is mixed with spices and im guessing some sort of cheese and served as a slice, like a pie!   I ordered mine spicy with meatballs and it was fantastic!   I was with a friend and ordered fried pickles which were great, the dipping sauce they come with is good as well.    Next time I'm in town I'm going to give their extensive beer selection a try.

I was on a business trip and due to availability I ended up here with a coworker.   The lobby and bar area look great and have lots of room for having a cocktail, or breakfast or a private  work area with computer and internet access.     The room was nice, clean and the bathroom and shower looked modern, were clean and everything worked great.   The hidden refrigerator always comes in handy for keeping left overs fresh for another day.  Anyone that does a lot of traveling and is sick of fast food can appreciate this.   The only reason I did not give this place 5 stars is that when a person walks in wearing work clothes from the day they should be treated the same regardless of how they are dressed.  If i walked in wearing a shirt and tie like i normally would i think the attitude would have been different.   overall it was an ok experience.

I Decided to stop by here out of desperation of not being able to find anything remotely healthy in the area.  I ordered one of their salads with cranberries, feta cheese, and vinaigrette.  the salad was good and the services was great.  Its nice to find a small business that cares about quality and their customers.    I'll be back for more!

This place is pretty great!.  I ended up stranded with a busted alternator in a work truck and after calling ahead this is the only place that had one in stock.  The sales associate made sure I had the right part and after installing it at my shop the core return was easy.   I'm glad they had the part ready to go.

This is a solid Mexican food place you need to try.  If you're driving up dont let the exterior fool you, It's nice on the inside and this place was nearly packed at 5pm on a Tuesday.   I called ahead and ordered the chicken fajita burrito and I was there within 10 minutes to pick it up right as it came out of the kitchen.  The burrito came with rice, beans, chips, and salsa. I opted for the Caesar salad for a small amount extra.   The burrito was large and good, served wet with melted cheese with sour cream and guac on the side.  The rice and beans were ok, and the Caesar salad was not worth the extra dollar or so, I'd suggest you pass on that.   The yelp reviews on this place are pretty accurate based on my experience

I travel a lot for business and I stay exclusively at the Marriott properties.  This one really just wasn't all that great of an experience.  First impression  of the place is that its in a not-so-great neighborhood and the way the road is laid out if you miss the turn in you have to go around and try again.  My company called ahead and made reservations with their credit card on file for payment, the lady at the desk was nice and to the point and thanked me for waiting and during the check in she asked for a credit card for incidentals which is typical and fine.   I got my key and headed up to the room to drop off luggage and then head back down, immediately outside the front door I was propositioned by someone asking if I wanted a "date"  I declined, but I knew what was up.   After returning with dinner I got comfortable and hopped int he shower, I'm 6'6" tall and my head was literally 3 inches from the ceiling in the shower, its an odd feeling some people may never experience. Overall the room was clean organized and typical, just had a dated and worn feeling.   In the morning I packed up and headed down to get breakfast which is supposed to be served between 6:30 and 8 or so, unfortunately I guess the person who normally sets it up was not there so breakfast was not ready,  The manager was trying to get things together and was running around trying  to make it happen.  For anyone that stays at these hotels they give you a receipt under your door sometime during the night and I noticed that my credit card was charged for the full amount.  Since the manager was running around and I had to be out the door I didnt even bother trying to get this sorted out   I'd suggest you stay at a different location if you have the option.

This is a convenient stop along  headed into Phoenix, or back to out towards California.  The restrooms are clean, they have a large selection of hot dogs, treats, drinks, coffee, whatever you want ready to go.

This is a great little gem hidden in the back streets of Tempe.  After along day i stopped by with some friends for beer.  I had the IPA which was just right, not too hoppy, but just  crisp enough for summer..  My friends had a few other brews that ranged from dark to light that also were good.    We ordered a chicken wrap thing and honestly its freaking amazing! its like 2 giant egg rolls that are fried and served with some type of cucumber dressing?   The staff is friendly and casual,but helpful in selecting beer if you don't know what you want. This is a great place to bring a small group since they have seating inside and out, and large cooling boxes blowing cool air over the patio.  I'll have to make it a point to stop by another time.

This is a great local sandwich shop.  The guys from my local fire department brought me here on a previous trip and I stopped by again for a works sandwich and pasta salad.  It looks like this is family run and they do it right.  The menu has sandwiches numbered and a clear description of what's inside.  The sandwich I ordered was made quickly, put in a box and i was out within about 5 minutes, I had to make sure to grab my tasty pasta salad out of the cooler on my way out.    The price is right, the service is good, and its a good sandwich stop by if you're in the area.

I love this place!   Usually I stay at a different hotel, which is only 100 feet away, but this is definitely a place you can stay long term.  The desk staff were friendly and with my rewards offered a choice of anything from their pantry.. just no alcohol.. bummer :P .    I was surprised to find a kitchenette with an apartment sized fridge with ice maker, a real closet, small living area and a squishy awesome bed.  The bathroom was also clean, with the expected toiletries.    If there is anyone who stays in a hotel more than 2 nights those people know the value of having a refrigerator, microwave, and if you stay longer you can live here, since there is a 2 burner stove, utensils, pots & pans and everything you need.   In the morning they have a continental breakfast, which I'm guessing includes eggs, bacon or sausage, cereal, and the usual items. 4  My stay is not over, but I will be back again.

I have stayed here many times, and this location is consistently good.  The front desk staff is friendly and helpful. On my most recent trip Tabitha was friendly and easy to deal with and informed me of the usual breakfast and even the free snack from the snacks with the type of Marriott Rewards account my company has.   Somehow I ended up with one of ADA rooms, due to availability and the time I arrived. Seeing as I dont need a wheel chair accessible room, I found it a little awkward that everything was lower to the ground and the toilet was higher off the ground. I understand the need, but being 6'6" its just different.  I didnt mind and i always wondered how the door bell / strobe light thing worked. The room was clean, organized, had 2 TVs, refrigerator and microwave everything i could want for a week.  Every morning they offer a complimentary breakfast with eggs, bacon, or sausage, oatmeal, fruit, bagels, muffins, toast and an assortment of other items.  My only suggestion to the Marriott chain would be to add something new every once in a while. Every single hotel i stay at within the chain has the exact same thing every single time.  I'm amazed by the consistency of all the locations, but it would be nice to change it up.

It was 6pm on Tuesday, the sun was setting, and I was on a mission to buy a descent soldering iron from this place.   I walked in the front and was not greeted by the person standing at the entrance, but I didnt care.  I wandered around for 10 minutes before finding a person to ask where they kept their soldering Irons.  The person I asked I thought was a security guard (since nobody else was around) turned out it was someone that worked for ADOC, oops, I was finally able to identify someone stocking boxes, but not wearing any type of name tag, I wasn't sure if he actually worked there, or was stuck in this giant cavern of electronics and had nothing else to do. I asked him where soldering irons were at, but he was not able to put the words together to tell me, so he led me on an epic journey through many Isles of gizmos, gadgets and components and finally found an entire aisle of soldering gear.    I found what I needed, I had to weed through the boxes that had been opened and not put away and then headed to the check out which was quick and efficient and I was on my way.   If you know what you want this is a place to go.  If you're in doubt as to what you need, you'll leave more confused than you entered.

I must have caught this place on a bad day .   First thing i see opening the door is one of the employees taking break sitting at one of the tables.  I'm sure there is a policy about this. but perhaps the first table that a customer sees is not the best idea.  right near these tables there was a black cover that was just left there.  Im not sure if it was a cover for chairs? or umbrellas maybe? tables perhaps? either way it was left danging over the trash cans near the front.   Second this place seemed understaffed for 6 pm.  There was one person running the line, i was behind a family of 6 or 7 who cleared out most of items i wanted.  Its no biggie since that's the risk you take with this type of restaurant.  The person that was serving everyone was calling back items they were running low on, eventually 2 works came out with blue bags full of frozen nuggets and dropped them in the fryer.  It was obvious these 2 workers didn't want to be there and seemed less than enthusiastic to be there.  for the food.  well lets start with the "new" fried rice, with the card on the glass saying "due to an industry shortage of eggs try our new fried rice and let us know what you think"  I'll save another form trying this. its not good, move on.  The original product with egg wasn't exactly spectacular, but it was good.  This new version is just not good its more like cafeteria flied lice than anything.  for the first item i opted for the orange chicken which is usually a safe bet, but this seemed like it had been sitting out for a while and i got the bottom of the barrel.  The orange chicken was one of items being prepared by the "chefs" .. next item i wanted to try the honey chicken.  Once again just not good. it is chicken strip like pieces breaded and fried.  This appeared to be sitting for a while when i chose it, and im pretty sure i was right. it was nasty and I didnt bother finishing it.  Finally the Bejing Beef... the parts that were edible weren't bad.. but many pieces were hard as rock and i didnt bother finishing this item either.  \  Overall a  so so experience with crappy food.  with a 3 item and a drink and $13 gone  .it's  not worth it. find another place to go.

I really don't understand the negative ratings for Hertz at this locations.  I travel a lot for work and i'm also a Hertz Gold club member.  The process is efficient and easy.  You reserve your car online,  get to the garage, look for your name, head to the pace and hop in your car.  all they do is verify your identity on the way out and send you on your way.  Usually if you are not happy for any reason there are usually free upgrade cars available that you can choose from.  I have rented in many cities, in many airports and have yet to have a problem.    I noticed at some airport locations there are multiple cameras that take pictures of the car as you leave, I didnt notice it here, but i did take a few quick pictures of a few dents and dings just in case.  Overall the car was nice, clean and ready to go and included a free Hertz never lost gps, which works ok i guess.  my google maps app works better and includes traffic... and random question  any idea what the camera lens is for on the front of this thing?

This place is soo good!.     In my many travels i rarely find a place like this. I'm glad i got off the freeway an exit too early.  The thing that grabbed my attention first was the Filipino fast food sign in the window.  After a long day of traveling and work I didnt want to drive around endlessly, or endure the usual fast food crap that's out there.    Im pretty sure it was Gloria that helped me, she was friendly, inviting and helped me identify a few dishes that were somewhat strange to me.    I ended up ordering longaniza that was fantastic, very tender and flavorful.  the second was a beef with potatoes and carrots and spices which reminded me of something my mom would cook.  Its nice to have flavors and a meal like this when a person is away from home  At the end of there these sugar glazed burrito looking things that i asked about, Gloria said it was dessert.  I think it was some type of pastry dough, with bananas maybe? and glazed with sugar.  I have no idea what these are called but the taste and texture  brought back a familiar flavor and texture that I haven't had since i was a kid.  if you're a visitor to the Las Vegas area and if you're not a club rat cruising the strip for tail, i suggest you take a quick drive, or taxi to china town and give this place a try.  People thought your review was:

This is a tough one to rate. I've been to a Cracker Barrel before and it was alright dining in.    This time I decided to get a meal to go, since i was traveling alone, and my hotel room was ready with the a/c cranked up full blast I figured i'd just be comfortable and have my meal elsewhere.   I called ahead after reviewing the menu and I  asked if there were any specials, I was informed that the special of the day was a turkey dinner.  I thought about it and after looking at other options, decided to go with it.  The lady on the phone was polite and easy to understand and I was told that my meal would be ready in 5 minutes.  Luckily i was just on the other side of the shopping center and was there in 5 minutes.   The meal wasn't ready so I wandered around the gift shop part of the restaurant for about 15 minutes admiring the Christmas items for sale.. It's only September (too soon in my opinion)    The person that brought out the food in a to go bag double checked the order item for item and it was correct.  I headed back to my hotel and laid out the items: corn bread stuffing, turkey, cranberry dressing,  corn bread and biscuit with apple butter,   mac   n cheese.  With all the items in their respective containers and sitting on my table the meal somehow lost its sparkle.  having a large plate with just a couple pieces of turkey, gravy and cranberry dressing just looked depressing, but if it all the items were together it would just be a mushy mess by the time i got to it. I picked through the different items, the cornbread dressing was good, the turkey was just OK,. the cranberry dressing was pretty tasty, the gravy tasted like something from the store, the mac n cheese was lacking flavor, the apple butter was good, but I wasn't sure where to put it so it ended up on one of the rolls.    Overall i guess the experience was alright, and a meal for $10 isn't bad.  I'd probably go somewhere else given any options.

...And then.... there was a Subway... that got it Right!   As you can tell by previous posts I have been on a mission to see how bad a subway can get and I've been surprised by how bad some are.  This one is actually good.  I asked if they had buffalo chicken, they said now, BUT we can make it.. sweeeet!.   I asked for extra jalapenos and peppers and instead of giving me a blank stare trying to figure out what I said, they added a hand full of each.  Before the sandwich was wrapped up it actually looked good! .. with other Subways it looks like Ray Charles put the sandwich together and its just a mess when you open it up.

I've stayed here several times over the last few months and I have nothing to complain about.  The hotel is located freeway close, and is easy to get in and out of.. The parking lot has more than enough room even when the hotel is booked.    The Continental breakfast is convenient and ready at 6am with a good variety of selections.    After so many trips the desk staff remember your name which is always nice.

This is a mixed review and i had thoughts either way that would change the rating between a 1 and a 4, so I decided to break it down as follows.   1. First impressions.  4 stars.  This location is right off the freeway, has plenty of parking and is located in an area with several restaurants and is also nearby the race track nothing overly fancy, but just fine business people.   2.Check in and greeting 4 stars.  My company pre paid for 3 of us and everything was in order and we didnt have any problems.   - Odd moment 1 star.  The person at the front desk was nice checking 3 of us in to 3 different rooms, but after i unloaded my luggage from my car and heading back to park, she said something along the lines of " make sure your coworker brings the trolly back" . uh  what ? one of my guys used he luggage cart to bring things to his room.. and if he doesnt return it the 30 feet to the lobby.. this is my problem? . eh whatever.   . but there is a bonus of fresh, slightly burned cookies between 5 an 6.   3. Getting settled in.  2 stars The room was large, 2 queen beds, with a kitchenette, fridge, microwave, cookware etc. with a view of the pool.. Cool! .. well.. found dust covering the top of the fridge,  dust on the microwave, and a hair in the tub.. kinda gross, but otherwise looked clean.. I also opened the freezer to grab the ice bucket and found a partially used cocktail.. possibly from the maid or the previous visitor  see pics.  4. sleep, chill time, etc. 3 stars the beds were comfy and the sheets looked clean, the noise level was average, nothing amazing, nothing bad. just about right..  Odd grosser note Negative 4 stars ..  at some point i knocked my glasses off the night stand and they fell behind, so i moved the nightstand and found a pile of dust bunnies, a collection of pens, a bottle cap, and an empty bag of beef jerky.. wtf, gross.  this must be on the once a year schedule to be cleaned. .. i left the items as found, less my glasses.. see pic.  5.  The breakfast... after day 5. 1.5 stars . kill me. its the exact same thing over, and over and over.  and no coffee 4 out of 5 times. I informed the lady running the breakfast bar that the coffee and she looked up and said " coffeeeee" ?? and walked away... weird.. i assume she was making more coffee? i'll never know.    The fried eggs with black pepper were so so the first day and i grew to loathe these things day after day... the round sausage patties were so so as well.. .   i had some regret after day 1, but i was able to work through the discomfort to try again the next day.   The toaster seems to have 2 settings .."carbonized black" and "raw" .. i couldnt' seem to cook a bagel right to save my life.   The fruit was gross, the oranges were small, bruised and a day from rot,  I did see some canned fruit salad, but i didnt want to chance it. There was oatmeal available, but eh.. not feeling it,  I think the only safe bet was cereal and boxed milk or yogurt.  ..  Please for the love of god change the menu every other day or something.  .. I did muster the courage to try the waffle maker with the pre poured batter .. it was ok.  The lady running the breakfast seemed like she was trying, but not doin so hot.

i swear i would give $40 for a t shirt that says "I got stuffed by Big Wongs"   they need to print and sell these t shirts!.  I stopped by on my last trip to this area and wanting to try something new, i ordered one of the shrimp noodle dishes that was on the wall as a special.  My helper that was with me ordered some sort of dish that was served with a fermented egg.   By the look on his face this was not a usual flavor of the american diet, but i loved watching it.   The person serving us was very busy, but ensured we were taken care of. I could see in the kitchen that they were busy cooking for the people seated and also the take out crowd.   I always liked places like this, when you order a coke and it comes in a can, or like I did ordered a Thai iced tea, and the ingredients are mixed right in front of you.  This little place has all kinds of a specials and is a nice change of pace while traveling.  I'll be back in the future

This is a solid place for lunch.  As usual when Im traveling I'm hungry and looking for local options and I really try to avoid the usual fast food joints.   Their menu is extensive and they have a pretty good breakfast menu if you want that. I ordered the roast beef with their home made horseradish mayo with a side of antipasto salad.  The sandwich was better than I expected and the salad was on point,     After checking in I found a local friend from the Orange County area reviewed this place and based on her review and others I read i'd have to agree they were right.

Somehow I keep finding myself coming back here over and over again.    I've said it before about other hotels, but its nice to come to the same place you've been and the people at the front desk remember you.  Over several trips it appears there are two types of rooms. One type has a small living area with another TV, fridge, microwave and pull out bed, and on this trip i stayed in a more traditional room with a king bed, desk, chair with ottoman and tv with a work desk.    Both rooms were clean, organized and what one would expect from a Fairfield hotel. they also come with the book or Mormon and Bible if you choose to do some evening reading.  There is also a continental breakfast that is repeated time and time again, with eggs, bacon, or sausage, fruit., cereal, yogurt, muffins, biscuits,  and a few other items depending on what day it is.   I'm still mystified by the round bacon, I've never seen a round pig, but hey it tastes pretty good.  oh did i mention coffee?? drink all you want when you want.. you may not sleep for a week but hey its free so drink as much as you can hold!

This place is awesome!!  I went out of my way to bring my coworker here after a long day and the quality of the bbq is excellent! We ordered a couple pounds of the moist brisket and bbq beans with a IBC bottled root beer.  The bbq sauce is great and whenever I'm in town I'll stop by.    Rudy's is right next door to "Can't Stop Smokin' BBQ and i tried them and Rudys is much much better!.    The pick nick style seating is nice, even the other customers were friendly and outgoing.   I'll be back!

We were hungry and on a mission to find something good, local and fairly inexpensive and this place fit perfect.  At first impression walking in there is nobody there, the walls are plain, and there was only one girl working behind the counter and the kitchen by herself.  Overll the place was clean and well kept, just not much decoration to look at.   I ordered the buffalo chicken hot sandwich with cheese.  Man.. I'ts been a long time since I had a Philly style buffalo chicken and it was good! I got the combo with fries that looked and tasted home made.    This is definitely a mom and pop type place that's worth checking out for lunch or dinner.  The large combo or large sandwich might seem a little pricey but its huge and you can easily make 2 meals out of it.

This place has to be one of those hidden gems in downtown phoenix.  I was on a business trip and pizza sounded good, and to my surprise you can customize your own pizza for under $8 with a whole array of toppings, and not just your typical pizza toppings. Once you pick your toppings one by one the person behind the counter pops it in the oven and about 5 minutes later its ready to go.   I would make a suggestion to the owner and have your menu with cheese, toppings, sauces, etc, on a board behind the counter so that the options are listed.  With so many cheeses, meats, and veggie toppings its a little hard to identify what each item is.   Overall I think the inside and outside of the restaurant could be a little more tidy, tables lined up, and cleaned off but I'm sure this is a busy place when there is an event going on at the nearby stadiums.

That's one kick ass sub!    I can honestly say I'm stuffed after eating here.  The subs area great,l the people are great and there are many choices of subs to order.  I happened to be passing through and had never tried Firehouse Subs before and I'm wondering where they've been my whole life!    The restaurant is clean,  organized and offers outdoor seating, which I took advantage of.     One of the benefits is they offer a first responders discount, I think its 15% which is always a bonus.  If you're between Phoenix and CA, stop by and eat here

Once again another hidden gem in Tempe.  My friend suggested going here for lunch, and telling us stories of coming here before it closed many years ago.  The decoration is definitely eclectic and there is a lot of it to see.  The server was more than on the ball, my drink barely got down 1 sip before it was refilled.  the burger was pretty good, i ordered a regular burger and fries.   This place has been recently remodeled and has a huge patio / bar area in addition to the large inside dining area.  I can only imagine this is a great place to have a party and have some drinks.

I really hope this place stays around for a long time.  I was hungry for dinner and i clicked on my Yelp app and this place had great reviews and had what i wanted, which at the moment was tacos!  The really unique thing about this place is that all the meats are cooked in a smoker which adds an added layer of flavor to your typical taco meat.   I asked for the 3 taco special which included rice and beans.  I had smoked chicken, smoked pork and smoked beef.  they were all pretty good!  The salsa bar is one of things you need to try. The salsa that stands out is an orange colored salsa that has some bite, and tastes like nothing I've had before.I'ts good, you need to get some. . The other salsas were also very good and I'll have to go back and try some different ones.   They have a good selection of meat, pretty much anything you want and many items on the menu that I have yet to check out,   Overall this is a great spot with people that care about the food they make. I'll be back for more
