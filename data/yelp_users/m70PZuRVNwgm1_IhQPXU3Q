This is my mums favorite chocolate.  For Grandparents Day...we tried to go to the See's at Arrowhead Mall. Called 3x and no answer.  Looked it up on Yelp, and not so good reviews.  Decided to wait and make the drive from Sun City to central Phoenix.   Glad we did. Super sweet, older lady at this location and much better reviews.  Purchased a 2 pound box of turtles.  She will love them. Which makes the drive totally worth it.

Nothing special, to be honest.  I am a huge supporter of small business owners. Sadly, Sonic has better tasting hotdogs and buns. Also his lemonade offered with special (says machine is broken, awaiting repair) is disgusting, watered down. Sadly, after all these years driving by... I know why I have not ever stopped in....and never will again.  :/

I started getting my acrylics done as a teenager here and continued to for years. The wife Tina (co-owner) does amazing work and is sweet. She remembers you and family members.  I even got my mom to go to her (I am super picky and known for my nails). She also does great eyebrows (not to thin) and a forehead/temple massage with it. Best part!!! So relaxing.  The husband, I hate to say it...is HORRIBLE.  Not only does he have...what is the phrase "zero bedside manners" he is horrible at nails.  I have since moved 1500 miles away, but come to town every other month or so. My mom now lives in Sun City. Not remotely close, I must pass 35+ places along the way. I still get my eyebrows done, and she still does amazing.   Today took a friend of mine in for her birthday to have a full set & I got fills. Unfortunately the husband did them. Horrible job, is an understatement!  Barely filled them. I asked for gel coat. He half a**ed it and didn't put them under UV light. They look like garbage.  Did zero drilling or filing after glopping on. I spent $112 total for her and I and I feel like my 2 year old could have done better.   He says dumb & rude things. Has done so many times over the years. Today told my friend "this your baby? You sure, she don't look anything like you" wtf!!!!  I am so saddened to say I will never get my nails done there again. Especially since I can pay way less for nice professional looking nails.

I came in tonight, with no interest in buying anything.  Just enjoying a little me time.  Found out Napoleon cosmetic line is 75% off! They are no longer going to carry it. Normally it is priced at more than I would like to spend. I really like the "auto pilot pore minimizer and mattifier" just couldn't justify the $32 for .59 oz tube. The in store tester was full.  Unfortunately, the gal couldn't give me a sample because it is not going to be carried anymore at the store.  (They only give samples of products they hope you will be glad to come back and buy)  Anyhow, I brought the tube up to the manager (along with new in boxes: 2 mascaras, lip conditioner, eye shadow pigment, and mattifying mineral primer) & told her I was aware of store policy, of no samples on discontinuing products.  However the tester was near full if not full and I really would like to purchase it.  She took the time to find the sku# and not only sold it to me, gave me an additional 15% off the 75% off price.  In all I scored! A total of  $157.06 products, I had wanted to have for only $40 I am very happy with her customer service!

The girl who washed & cut my hair was awesome & did a great job. The lady who checked me in was a rude dip s*#&. Also why go to this place, 15$ cut, $5 wash, $25 to dry & style. For less than $55, you can go to a salon & not get nickle & dime & also not wait 40 minutes. I won't be back. I hope the gal who washed/cut my gair...goes somewhere better.

2nd time thru the drive thru.  Very nice gentleman took my order. Even let me order off the breakfast menu before 11pm.  Allowed me to take my time, to look at menu. Didn't rush me. I appreciate that. I know people expect"fast" all the time. I appreciate him taking the time.   He did forget to give me my daughters milk. I am in line getting it now. Very nice man. Accidents happen.

Walked in 41 minutes prior to close. Door sign said they closed at 930pm. Man says: ordering to go? Said no, table for 3 please.  "We are closing in 20 minutes" (even though a party of 6 was enjoying a meal nearby)  Who closes 20 minutes early, and turns down potential business 41 minutes prior to stated close time. Especially when at this very intersection you have : Good China and Shanghai Grill. 3 options at this intersection.    I will gladly take my money elsewhere.

I LOVE this store.  By far the sweetest and friendliest employees of any Arizona Frys I have been to. We live in Seattle and shop at a sister store (QFC) and this isn't even the closest location or even the closest grocery store to my mums house in Sun City. Yet, every single time I come in (usually 5+ times every visit to Arizona) they are sweet,  polite, engaging in conversation with me and my 3 year old.  I would not shop here, if it wasn't for the employees.  Sometimes they don't have what I want or the best price on an item (employees don't have control over that) but the kindness of the employees keep me coming back.  For the bad reviews, saying bad service. .. sorry but I suggest you look in the mirror and see if isn't maybe a bit of how you approach them, or maybe you never worked in retail and never had a bad day.  Hands down, this is the best Arizona location.

Came in today, my go to Arizona location.  WAS my go to. After my 3 year old and I made our weekly purchase. ..coming out to the car (about 40 minutes prior to close) only 4/5 cars in lot. I noticed a group hanging out in the middle off the shopping cart return spot.  You would have hit them trying to put a cart in it, which was odd. Who hangs out "in" it. Normally I have a cart to return.  Today we had to bags, so we didn't need it.  My car was 4 spots from it, as I am trying to get my 3 year old safely in car...some tweaked out woman starts mumbling a "do you have any change to spare" it startled me. I said No, I carry zero cash. (Loudly) & I look up over my car and she is still coming at the car. I repeated it, she then asks if I can take them to the store and just buy them something? !! What the?! Really? It's after 10pm, I am with my toddler. ..you and 2 other adults and what appeared to be a 12/13 year old kid chilling in a stroller texting....want me to let you in my car and use my credit card.  I repeated again No and to please get away from my car. I carry & as soon as I came around she could see it and turned away finally.  Freaked me the bleep out. I never expected something like this at this location.  Also irked that at that close to closing the security dude was just socializing in the store, not standing near exit or that no one offered assistance to the car.  It has been 4 hours since I got home, but am still a bit rattled. I will never shop there again after sunset without being walked to my car like the grocery store offers. It made really realize,  I would rather be judged by 12, then carried by 6. Flipping tweakers. :/

I am also surprised by the low reviews, how can McDs next door score higher. I came here with my 2 1/2year old. Very nice employees. Food is typical diner food. Very generous portions. Who finishes, thank goodness for to go box.  I am a bit shocked how big the kids meal is. 2 very big Mickey shaped pancakes w/2 large slices of bacon. My little eater has plenty left over, I could've just shared.  The place is very busy for a Saturday night.  I will definately be back. I would also recommend it for a cheap, quick bite. :) I hope they keep getting good ratings.

I have to agree, maybe new management...but order was 100% correct, man at window was very nice. Why would anyone keep going back for years, if it is so bad?? I hope they get some more high stars to help their overall rating.  We will definately be back.

I agree,  super friendly employees.  Came into get a key made for my mum.  I prefer Ace to HD & Lowes, whenever I can. Even tho the stuff is typically a tad more...I love the local friendly help. No matter which Ace (AZ or WA) I prefer them. They are typically independently owned.  Customer service has always been far superior than that of big box stores, in my opinion.   Only reason I didn't give 5 stars, the savings card I have for Washington stores won't work @ this store but I was able to use it @the Sun City location.  Weird,  but okay.

I love this location.  Friendly employees of all ages. When we visit my mum in AZ, we bypass the Albertsons and head straight to this Frys.  My toddler loves the car shopping cart & the bakery gal always lets her pick her own cookie (a big deal to my kid) & the older gentleman cashier, always gives her a sticker.  Parking is ample.  Store is clean. Even the deli guys rock & remember you (and what hair color I had last trip haha) in a big metro city, little things like this...make them my go to Arizona store.

Friendly staff, can't beat half priced drinks from 2-4 & half priced shakes after 8pm. It is always a treat when visit my mum in AZ. Nice cheap way to quench ones thirst. In Washington we have to drive 3+ hours to find a Sonic. Can never go wrong with Cherry Lime-aid or an Ocean Water in this triple digit weather.

A year ago, this place was AMAZING. Now, a year later :( not so much. Ordered a #1 with no lettuce and no onion.  Got a soggy cold bun with lettuce and a piece of cold cheese.  Plus neither beverage had the lid on all the way. Thankfully it is 1030pm, and on my way to my mums...otherwise I would be furious having blue colored sprite all over me. Doubtful I will return to this location, based on the down slide.

Gotta agree, staff isn't the most upbeat. Seemed annoyed when I mentioned, Yelp listed them closed. Sandwhich was good, better thank Quiznos. Wish they had more veggie topping options. I had the chicken salad on pumpernickle. Very generous sized sandwhich for price.

A gentleman at the gas station, recommended this place.  After overhearing my 3 year old say she wanted "Chinese food"  Only one full table, upon arrival...yet it took 10 minutes for them to acknowledge and seat us. No biggie though, the lady was very sweet to my 3 year old and I appreciate that more.  The fried rice was a bit to buttery for my taste and not enough vegetables in it for my veggie loving child. The shrimp dish, she recommended was very good tho.  Kinda a bummer no kid menu/options. I am sure grandparents bring them.  Yes, the decor is dated (as stated in other review) but the 2 people who we saw working there and interacted with...were so nice and kind. I would stop in again when visiting my mum. I will just opt for a less buttery dish for my daughter.

I have been coming here for years. Even now living 1500+ miles away...This is a tasty stop while in Arizona.   I really love the flavorful gyro platter.   I will say, the bathroom this visit was so gross. Seemed more like an out house at the fair. I really hope the kitchen is kept cleaner. :/

Gross bathroom, and dirty play area. I go to many locations, never seen one that makes McDonald's seem clean. Until now. Play area had chunks missing in floor.  Changing station looked to be on its last leg.  Over disgusting.   Had to ask for sauces, never at any other location. Just seemed odd, kept behind counter. .unlike other locations.  Sauce theft an issue here? I won't return to this location ever.

Don't eat a lot of Panda Express.  However, this location seems to have friendly employees.  My 3yr old and I stopped in for a quick bite.  In our time eating,  every employee was busy. Cleaning,  helping customers and taking drive thru orders.  The food is typical PE food. Anyone expecting gourmet food, needs to eat at an actual Chinese restaurant.  We would definitely eat here again, when in the area. The store was clean and the friendly staff are the reason.

Huge portion sizes. Just very bland, season less gyro meat. I sadly wasn't impressed.  If you are basing this place on portion sizes, it is a 5. However, I prefer taste to size of my plate.  I will stick to Zs Greek for my gyro.

I am bummed to see a 1 star. I get all my RX filled here while in Arizona and their customer service is excellent.  Not to mention the guy at the window Joe, is super nice. He remembers little things. (Like my 3 year old loves, waving hi from the car and orange is her favorite color, so he gives her an orange lollipop) . I can't imagine bad customer service at this location.

I see the 3 previous reviews are bad, our visit was nothing like it. Not one car in drive thru. 8 cars in parking area. Not only was Caleb friendly, he repeated our order exactly as ordered. Including the large water (no charge, like other places) we visit my mum every other month in AZ & the service was so good, as was the chicken sandwhich & my daughters mini pancakes, we will be back. Probably one of the more perfect drive thru experinces we have had. We travel 3000+ miles every few months & have had our share of lousy service. This was a nice change.

I am beginning to really dislike this drive thru location.  3rd time they can't seem to get a drink order right. I asked for a kids milk light ice, & we have our cup for her. As well as an iced coffee with splash of milk. Again they gave her chocolate milk/heavy ice. Ugh

I am visiting my mum in Sun  City, needed an oil change for my 2012 Nissan. I was going to go to Pinnacle Nissan, read the low ratings on Yelp & decided not to. This popped up, with decent reviews & near Nissan.  I pulled in, after a bit of an odd start (no on to creat us, ask what we needed) I found a tech, he handed me a clip board to fill out. I put our info, asked for oil change.  I do love/appreciate the kid room. My little one & I played blicks.  The cashier called us up, when ready. (cashier by the way, was a very sweet grandma type from IL) I was surpise to see no paper mats being used, no decal in window noting next service milage due or a complimentary car wash. I usually go to the VW/Nissan dealership by the house for service (& wash/vaccum is always included). I guess this dealership does things different.  Overall it was an okay experience. For a no fluff simple oil change, yes I will recommend them. I will stick to my local place tho :) the little things are just so nice.

I gotta say, 2nd time was wonderful.  Not only did the gentleman do a really nice, detailed inspection.  After my oil change, he came in and asked if we had a few more minutes so he could have it washed. :) and he was very personable, chatted with my little girl and I. Got my car and not only did they run it through the wash, but it seemed vacuumed.  I am really starting to love this place for my Arizona oil changes. (Service did only set next oil for 3k, my 2012 actually per manual says 3750k, but no biggie, since I have a Nissan and this is a volkswagon dealer) I will be book marking them for my next trip here, next month.

I personally think the subs are just so so. My mum likes them however.  So this is the second time I have popped in during the last hour of business to get her a sandwich,  while visiting her in Sun City.  Both times the workers seem not the friendliest,  however being a flight attendant for almost 10 years... I get the end of a long shift blues. Drained from a busy day. So I don't let it bug me.  I am sure my mum will have me stop in again.

When the rootbeer float I ordered imploded all over my freshly washed/vaccumed car...the girls says "yah that happens a lot when you put the straw in, do you want more napkins" wtf!!!!! Uh seriously, I threw it away in front of her, she offered zero replacement, even tho 2/3 were on ground & car! Even though I had just spent $20 on sandwhiches. Zero help, except: do you want more napkins" Idiot!!! I have never left a bad review anywhere until now. Disgusting customer service. I will never return to this location, even if these sandwhiches turn out to be tasty.

Of all the Sushi restaurants we have visited in Arizona, this one has been the best.  Immediately greeted upon arrival.  Friendly owner, very personable.  Food was delicious.  Even accommodated my little 3 year olds request for a drink like mine. She had a "mocktail"  We live in Seattle and eat sushi once a week, this place was delicious and I will bookmarking it. For when we are in Arizona.

Great little place, off the 101 and Tatum. Northwest side of the westbound on ramp. Nice waiter, my 3yr old and I ordered from the menu, conveyor style sushi didn't look super fresh. However, everything we ordered off the menu was delicious.   Would stop in again.

It might just be a pharmacy chain, but I am 1500 miles from the Rite - Aid I go to. My RX needed refilled on a Friday night (about 730-800) & I came here. At 1st the woman in the pharmacy department said she didn't know if they could get it transferred,  it would probably take 24 hours.   Umm no good, I needed it that evening.  She consulted the older man in the back, busy on a computer.  Not only did he call the Washington store, he got it transferred and filled it...within about 30 minutes. .. While my little girl and I were at the store.   I appreciate him going the extra mile to get the job done, on a Friday night.

1st: hours are wrong.  Closes at 10. Anyway, came in tonight for a bite. Living in Seattle, I have fairly high expectations of sushi. Especially when it is a revolving type establishment.  Nothing except the deserts looked even remotely appetizing on the revolving belt. Every mini plate looked dried and old.   I decided to or to full size rolls off the menu. Same price for any full size roll (12.99 each) a bit more than I pay in Seattle.   The cherry blossom roll was very good. The lollipop roll was different.  Edible, just don't think I would order it again.   The prices should be updated on the menu. I noticed the plaque at table and the menu listed different prices for each color plate. Otherwise a quiet place to eat.

Living in the Seattle area, we eat a lot of sushi. I am finding myself becoming, not so much a sushi snob, but instead having higher expectations when I am I'm Arizona and eating sushi.  This place is really tasty. Prices were on par with other sushi restaurants in the area. Decent size rolls. Great happy hour options.  My 3 year old loves edamame.  During happy hour, I think it was $2.  My friend had a Groupon for them (can  not be combined with HH specials)  I love that it is kinda tucked away in what looks like a business complex. An abundance of parking, which is awesome.  Southeast corner of the intersection,  tucked behind the CVS. Overall a really filling, tasty meal.  They even had little clips for kids to attach to their chopsticks.

CARNE ASADA fries. Amazing!  I hope this place lasts. Horrible Del Webb sign blocks the entire location as you are heading west on Bell road. The sign has been an eye sore forever.  Every taco place that opens here doesn't survive.   I hope this one does. I LOVE the play on words "senor" taco in Sun City. Hehe and to pull up and see a row of gold carts...just makes me giggle.  My mum loves this place. So I am sure I will be picking up for her again.

I can't say it enough, this place is so dang yummy.  Portions are very good for the price.  Dishes are incredibly flavorful.  I try to get something different every time. The Diablo is crazy spicy. I had the shrimp burrito tonight and it was so goooood! I will be so mad if my next trip out here to see my mum...they close. And I will blame that hideous, god awful sign of Del Webb.  It is an eyesore & blocks it's visibility when heading west on Bell road.

The location is much easier to get to and out of then the now closed 7410 West Bell Road store. Inside is much larger than previous location.   However it is not nearly as good of service now. Half a** the drink making. I guess in this area not a lot of competition.  I just guess I expect more, living in Washington.

If I could give a negative star, I would.  Dirty/dark old bar. Ordered Saki, glass were filthy and dingy. Menu prices are higher than the online price lists. Owner had excuses to give his staff, but wouldn't come out and speak with us.  We eat Pho weekly, in Seattle.  This was disgusting and an embarrassment to anything Pho. Even the waitress said she prefers eating Pho anywhere else.  I would never return or recommend this place to anyone!

Garbage.  $3 car wash, up sold to the 6$ (no problem) which is a waste.  Not only is exterior not drive.  Tons of foam/soap on back window and side view mirrors.  What a joke.  Seriously, now on to auto zone to clean them.
