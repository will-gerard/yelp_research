I love Native New Yorker, but this location has been consistently awful. ALL of the waitresses who have served us are tweeking on something EVERY SINGLE TIME we're there. I understand people get overwhelmed and confused once and a while, but the mannerisms and actions of these girls made us uneasy for the last time. We've been forgotten about, ignored, felt like WE were bothering them (no, we weren't annoyingly flagging her down, she was taking our drink order). Basically they will just walk up to you and say "can I help you" in a way that basically says "damnit I have another customer that I don't want." This location is trash central. The one off of Ray Rd. (W of the I-10 and even the Tempe (Broadway) is just fine, but this location just...sucks. Terribly.

This place looks like it might be shabby from the outside, but when you walk in it's a legit wine bar! Their mozzarella sticks are REALLY good, seriously I have never had mozzarella sticks that good before. I've had the Eggplant Parmesan rolls (or something like that), Pasta Greek and of course the Chicken pasta with pesto/alfredo sauce which were all flavorful and delicious! Portions are very generous; I end up always having leftovers! Their house wines are actually not too shabby either. I don't think you'll be finding any Liberty Creek here! It's really good, but can be a bit pricey, so you'll definitely want to make it a once-in-a-while thing. Still, it's really damn good!

Love Coffee Bean! I think it's a lot better than Starbucks. I love coffee, but I'm also a huge tea person, which makes this a great place for me! They have a great tea selection and I like how they always have a different kind out for you to sample and explore a little. The people at this location are really nice, too. As for coffee: I LOVE the "Black Forest" which is a blended coffee drink with cherries and chocolate-covered espresso beans, I can barely make it to my car before sucking down half of it! It is just so damn delicious :). Sometimes the tea can be a little watered down, but it has only happened once or twice out of the 30 something times I've gone there. Strawberry cream tea is zee best!

Good stuff! Not that normal grease bucket Chinese food (a la Panda Express)! I like the Tokyo Chicken, but the Teriyaki is really good, too. The man who owns the place, Fu, is SUPER nice and always had a good attitude. I don't think this guy can ever NOT be happy, he makes my day every time! Good place and way cheap. I like how you have the option to get white meat chicken, too.

We went to P. F. Chang's last night and I was really impressed with their service and of course the food. When we walked in, it was obvious there was a wait. We were pretty hungry and almost left, but the two hostesses working were just so sweet that we decided to wait it out anyways (which turned out to only be around 10 minutes). One of them even checked on us a couple of times and told us that there was only one person in front of us and we were next. Such a sweetheart. Our server was Claire and she was just as sweet! Usually when restaurants are busy, you can tell the servers are stressed out and they tend to kind of rush you to make a decision, but she was the exact opposite. We ended up deciding on the chicken lettuce wraps and split the Mongolian Beef. NOM! It was so good. I wish we had leftovers because I can't stop thinking about the deliciousness that was P. F. Changs! The manager, Mike, is a very very nice man, too which I think must rub off on all of his employees. Great food and amazing service. I have NOTHING to complain about!

This place is fabulous! They have great sushi that has never disappointed (it's almost addicting)! The best part is that they have all you can eat sushi for $20 a person. And it's not just the podunk rolls either; it's a great variety of everything. All I had to do was come here once and I was hooked :) The staff is always really nice and attentive, too (and I mean every single one of them). They really pay attention to what's going on and make sure you're always taken care of. The owner, Richard, is awesome! You can really tell that he cares about everything and he always goes out of his way to make sure everyone is happy.   Oh, did I mention the Korean BBQ? Although it's been hard to tear myself away from the sushi, I've had the Korean BBQ a couple of times and have loved it! The side dishes are all very yummy and remind me of when I used to visit my grandma's house :) NOM!   I recommend this place to everyone I know, not just because it's so damn delicious, but because it's one of the few places that DESERVES to have tons of business. Go NOW!:)

I got the Delux Burger and it was really good! The carmelized onions, feta/gruyere cheese, and arugula went really well with it! They actually recommend that you get your burger cooked medium-rare, which was perfectly fine with me since that's how I like my steak cooked. The ground beef was really high quality, too, so I definitely see why they recommend you order it that way. The only thing was that the bottom bun got crazy soggy. I ended up just getting rid of it all together. I love sweet potato fries and love how you can choose to order them mixed with regular potato fries, which is what I did. To be honest, the fries really weren't THAT amazing, but they were also only $3. Oh yeah, you also have to buy the fries separately. This isn't a place for penny pinchers, but it's also not super expensive considering the quality of the burger you are getting. No, it's not a spot to go to all the time, but if you're looking to get out and try a good quality burger, definitely go for it. I'd say it's worth it!

Their pizza is to die for! I cannot keep myself away from ordering the same thing every single time because it's basically everything I've ever wanted in a pizza. Their crust is on the thin side, which is just my style, and has a ton of flavor. Their white procida (sp?) pizza is absolutely amazing: goat cheese, prosciutto and pear deliciousness!   The ambiance is great also. I would definitely suggest sitting on the patio (if it's not sweltering hot outside) and enjoying some live music and cocktails. This is definitely a happy place for me:)

This place is right by my house, but to be honest it always looked a little dingy from the outside.  However, after realizing that they had dim sum and had so many good reviews, I was down to try it!  I was already pleasantly surprised when I walked through the door. It was actually pretty cute inside and very clean! A lot of Chinese/Asian restaurants have the tendency to smell pretty funky, but not this place! As soon as we sat down the carts started coming! We had some shrimp dumplings with huge hunks of shrimp in them that were awesome. Most of what we had were dumpling-style dishes (all very good). We also had short ribs that were pretty tasty. They didn't have any green veggies on the cart, but were nice enough to cook some fresh for us as part of the deal. We also had seaweed salad that was delicious, too! They have dim sum every day from 11A-3P, so it's a great thing to do for lunch and pretty cheap (depending on how much you eat). Our total was a little over $20 and we were stuffed!  Don't be decieved by the awkward location and shabby-looking exterior, it's definitely worth trying :)

NOM! I work right across the street from them and decided to skip the salad and go to Lenny's! It was a lot different inside than I had expected (it's in a strip mall) it was white and red checkered retro-style... Like a good old-fashioned burger joint SHOULD be! I had a "build your own burger" with Jack cheese, jalapenos, avocado and 1000 Island dressing. SO good, the fries were hot and crispy, too! It wasn't a grease bucket burger place, the burger was surprisingly not greasy at all. I didn't even feel as guilty as I thought I would because it was clearly good quality meat. Oh and Lenny actually exists, which I found pretty cool. (I've never seen Filibero or Wendy anywhere;)) The service was great, too. Everyone was so friendly even though it was during the lunch rush and they were slammed.

SUCH great prices on produce! You'll never want to buy your fruits and veggies anywhere else after going here. I am an avid "juicer" and find that the pricing and quality of their produce is fabulous! It's often a bit crowded, but everyone is so nice there that it doesn't even bother me. Plus, I like to be among the others who like to go the healthy route anyways!:) Sandwiches are bomb too, you can fill out a little form and customize your sandwich, shop and swing by the counter and it's waiting there ready for $3.50. Nom!:) Staff is super-friendly too!

I used to work at a popular sushi joint, which was awesome but kind of pricey considering what you were getting. We found this place and haven't been back! It's freaking delicious and the staff is SO nice. My (straight-up white) boyfriend is now eating sashimi and nigiri like it's his business! The all-you-can-eat is great and comes with your choice of tempura or gyoza appetizer and sashimi for 2. SO GOOD, the white toro and salmon are our faves! It's always fresh and cold, never warm sushi! It's not one of those uber-trendy places, which is great from our point of view (we hate Snobbsdale). It's GREAT quality and the amount of fish you receive is definitely a generous amount! If you're not into all-you-can-eat, they have a really generous happy hour that extends until night time, not just for lunchers. Oh, did I mention $6 sake bombers all the time? Holla! lol

I have been spoiled to have always had homemade menudo, so I was a bit skeptical to try an actual restaurant! Well, one day I just felt the need! After going to 2 different restaurants that served menudo on the weekends and both of them being out, I found El Taco de Chandler!  Even though I was convinced that I actually did cross the border somehow and winded up in Mexico, I actually kind of wanted it that way! BRIGHT building on the outside with people riding their bikes/lurking around the parking lot, but hey!, why not?  They serve good old mexican cuisine! Even that grilled whole fish (not sure what it's called, but it's creepy looking and delicious) and of course, my beloved menudo! The seafood selection is pretty big and the girls who work there are really sweet. It's obviously one of those neighborhood hangouts, as they seemed to know everyone who walked in the door by name.   The tortillas were clearly homemade and the menudo was fantastic! The best part is that they serve it all week long, not just Saturdays and Sundays. It might look shady from the outside... and inside actually... but trust me, it's good! It's either go to a modern-looking restaurant to get americanized mexican food or go here and get the real thing, your choice.  I'd like to go back and try their other entrees, too. They all looked good and what I saw other people ordering smelled/looked delicious. If they could get menudo SO right, I have a feeling that everything else is just as good.  Oh, and they serve beer. :)

I would rate it one star if it wasn't for our salads being good.  A coworker and I ordered two salads for pick up, as we were on our lunch break and didn't want to waste a lot of time. When I asked the guy who answered the phone for two small salads, he asked if I wanted a "single" or "small." After asking him what the difference was, he told me that the small served 4-6 people and the single was good for one person... Hmm... I guess it would be a single then! From the website, it looked like there were only three options (S/M/L), but whatever.  When we showed up to pick up our order, it was pretty clear that they were short on staff. There were 2 people working and one of them was behind the bar pretty much the whole entire time. They were definitely NOT in a hurry even though the restaurant  had a good amount of people there... Just a couple of dudes putzing around!   Anyways, he ran our cards and returned with 2 piddly, TINY boxes of salads.. What? After sitting in my car and wondering why we were charged $7 for a snack of a salad, we decided to go back in and see what the deal was. After we told him that it wasn't explained to us what a "single" was, he admitted that he wasn't being exactly clear. "Yeah, it was probably my fault." Uh, yeah it was! That was all he said, no apology or anything. Now, we are not the type of people who go around looking for freebies, but you would think he would have been a little more... I don't know... Courteous! He ended up running our cards twice, since we wanted a larger order and disappearing in the back for almost half an hour. We would have left if he hadn't charged us, but we were stuck waiting... For...Ev....ER!  While we were standing there twiddling our thumbs, it was obvious that some of the other customers felt just as neglected and frustrated. One woman even had to get up out of her seat and walk over to one of them to have something taken care of. Not cool. Finally, he brought us our food and still gave no sign that he even cared about what had happened. It's a cute place and the food might be decent, but I would not go back to this location!

OMG they did it again. I was told I would be receiving THREE water bottles on Sept. 6 and just came home to find 4 water bottles at my door. Today is Aug. 22. These people just can't get it together. I have like 8 empty water bottles that I would really like to get rid of, but they can't even get their schedule right. Also, I still have yet to be refunded for the amount they charged my account and it's a week later. Canceling their service all together. Don't even bother with them.  8/28: I called them regarding the bottles they dropped off and they sent someone to pick them up the next day. BUT GUESS WHAT? They still charged me for those 4 bottles they picked up. I wouldn't have even seen the charge if I wasn't monitoring by account after the first 50 goof ups. How much common sense do you need to realize to cancel the charge too if the bottles are picked up? Then the doofus had enough guts to ask me if I wanted to purchase tea for my next delivery, yeah right! If you are crazy enough to have their service, be prepared to hold their hands through the process because it's clear that ALL of them don't know what they are doing.

Like just about everyone else, I found this store while searching for a place to buy my Vibram FiveFingers! I would MUCH rather spend my money here than in any of the corporate, chain stores! Mick (the owner) didn't just sell the shoe, he knew a lot about them and was very informative! Him and his wife are quite a team! If you've read "Born to Run" (which is what made me want my Vibrams in the first place), this is the store to go to! They also carry chia seeds.  One thing: Listen to him when he tells you not to go running in your Vibrams ASAP. He told me to walk around and get used to them, but I was too damn excited. Patience turned out to be a virtue in this case. I figured I would be fine since I was already running around 3 miles a pop (even though he still warned me not to go out and run the same day). Well I went out and ran that same day like a fool. Five days later my calves are still ON FIYA! :)  But back to my point: Don't spend your money at one of the big name stores where some random doofus sells you a shoe he has no idea about. Instead, come here and get a little education at the same time (and maybe even a deal on the shoes)!

I dropped my dogs off at Wiggles and Wags when I went out of town for the weekend and was very pleased with how wonderful the staff was and the quality of care they provided!  My dogs have only been boarded once before, so I'm sure they aren't the easiest visitors! However, I was confident that they were receiving the best care they could get from the staff at Wiggles and Wags!   I'll start with the staff. From the first time I called them, I knew they were truly passionate about that they did and were doing more than just running a business. I was already put at ease before I had even dropped my dogs off!  When I dropped my dogs off, I was very surprised with how nice the doggie rooms were! No cages, no "shelter-like" barricades... They were actual rooms!  They also have cameras throughout the facility that monitor the dogs during afterhours. Live videos are sent directly to the owners iPhone! How awesome is that?  And yet another perk... Most places keep your dogs locked up and only take them for walks/playtime if you pay extra. Not Wiggles and Wags! They rotate dogs in and out of the play area every 1 1/2 hours! If your dogs are kind of sketchy with other dogs (like mine are), no problem, they will bring them out alone! Everything is included in their price (which is very reasonable, by the way).  After seeing how great their pet resort is, I'm definitely considering taking my dogs to their obedience classes now. I would recommend this place to everyone. Another fabulous Yelp find!

My dad used to take me to the one in Tucson when I was little and I LOVED it. When I moved to Phx I looked for one and was so bummed that there weren't any. And then it opened right down the street from me! Good quality beef, not that fatty crap that some places serve. I like their hot italian beef sandwich with extra hot peppers! So good and so filling. One of those is like breakfast, lunch and dinner for me. It's family-owned, too! I think it's operated by the guy's grandchildren or something. So happy there's one in Chandler now!

This place is pretty bomb. The guys working there are super nice and I love how you get a rag to wipe the interior every time. When my car is going through the wash I just scrub away inside:) And free vacuums after, and these things aren't messing around! I've found them to be higher in power than some of the ones you pay for. Regardless of if you get the $10 unlimited car washes or just pay as you go, it's a great deal. I was pretty depressed when they closed down a while ago, but they reopened and were 10X better than before. It can be super crowded, but it still hasn't forced me to buy an express pass, so it can't be that bad;)

I work nearby and don't have a lot of healthy lunch options. Good thing I have this place to go to!  I love their brown rice bowls (I've had the chicken and Korean beef, both delicious). Their salads are really yummy, too, but just not substantial enough for me. However, they have been enough for my coworkers, so maybe I just have a huge appetite. I also had this chicken greek wrap as a lunch special and it had so much flavor! It's a great place for lunch and the man, who I believe is the owner, is always very friendly!

Thank you Yelp!!  I was looking for a local coffee shop near my house and was thrilled when I saw that this place was right down the street from me.   This place is very roomy and is a great place to spend a few hours and get some work done! I always have a hard time finding a place to work when I go to chains like Starbucks and Coffee Bean, but I had so many options here! Comfy couches galore!  As for the actual coffee... Delicious! I chose a macadamia nut soy latte and it was so yummy. The pricing isn't bad either. I think it was a little over $4 for a large (and that was with the soy milk up-charge). It was so good that I drank it WAY too fast and kind of spazzed myself out. I couldn't help myself!   Such a great find! I'll definitely be back!

This review is LONG overdue, but....  My stepfather owns a hair salon back home and has been doing my hair since I was in 3rd grade (random I know, but it.was.awesome). Long story short, I have been practically lost since I moved here... More than FIVE years ago!  I had gone to a few salons (that shall not be named:)) and have never really felt like I was treated that well or listened to at all. Finally, I just decided to try my luck and rely on Yelp reviews... Enter Verde Salon!  This place was definitely a breath of fresh air; even the girl who answered the phone was super sweet! They were able to squeeze me in that same day with Nonni (sp?). She was sooo sweet and I have been back to her for a haircut since then. I even brought in pictures for a shorter cut the next time and she did exactly what I wanted. Definitely glad to have a normal place to go to now!

This place is really good and has great prices. I've been here for lunch a few times, as they are right by my office. However, they DO NOT understand what dressing on the side means. Instead, they drench your entire salad with way too much dressing. I, as well as a few of my coworkers, have asked them to put it "on the side" multiple times and they just don't get it. Pizza is delicious though.
