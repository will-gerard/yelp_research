Don't make the mistake of wasting your precious time as I did at the local DMV. Instead of waiting for your number to be called from a monotonous loudspeaker, sitting in a dirty waiting room with unruly kids and unsavory characters, only to be called to a counter with an employee who doesn't know the meaning of good customer service, you can enter an immaculate and well-appointed office with courteous, competent, and efficient employees who will ensure YOUR best interest, not the State DMV.

Unfortunately, this auto shop misdiagnosed an issue of front-end vibration at crusing speeds. After checking the car, they gave me about a half-dozen possibliities but could not promise any of the repair items would solve the problem. By contrast, another repair shop pin-pointed the cause, and performed the needed repairs to satisfaction.  However, I will have to give this auto shop credit for having a very comfortable waiting area with leather sofas, lcd tv, wi fi, and gormet coffees.

My experience at this Cobblestone location was so lame as they never even wiped off the roof of the car, leaving a very obvious bird poop stain at least six inches long. This was not a large SUV where one has to use a footstep to see the top either, but a low-profile sports car.

I usually come here to pickup a few baguettes that are fresh and right out of the oven. Despite this, I will have to agree on some of the recent negative ratings.   They are really stingy on the ingredients. For example, a 4-dollar Thai ice tea I ordered contained over 50% ice, and when I asked them to remove some ice and replace it with more tea, they refused and said something to the effect that refills were not allowed even though I had not yet consumed any.   On a side note, there is a sign at the register that reads, "in order to keep prices low we only accept cash." In my opinion, their prices are fair, but by no means low.  In the future, I certainly won't go out of my way to patronize this establishment. I'll be doing them a favor since I don't want to break their profit margin by asking for less ice in the drinks!

THE second worst-tasting pizza I've ever had, the first being Basha's deli pizza which actually made me sick. The only reason I didn't give it one star is that I managed not to vomit after eating a slice!

The barber from Nebraska gave me one of the best haircuts ever. Another satisfied customer.

Great middle-east style kababs and very reasonably priced. There is hooka service in an outside patio.

Selected the restaurant on the premise of using the Entertainment Book coupon only to find out that for whatever reason this merchant no longer accepts the promo. A disappointment. Nevertheless, the food was delicious, especially the lamb shank.

Good Indian food with abundant portions. With an Entertainment Book coupon, it was a bargain.

Uninspiring and lackluster thai chicken salad. Some of the ingredients such as the edame and red bell peppers were not fresh at all and tasted like they had a bit of freezer burn. This location is just a good place to meet a group of friends with a beverage and a scone.

Among the best Vietnamese cuisine experienced, and at rock bottom prices. Great pho, along with a stir fry noodle dish with a variety of vegetables. But don't order anything with shrimp. Let's just say it was fishy. And take extra care in the neighborhood, it's not safe.

Mystery meat and velveeta cheese breakfast burrito, served by employees obese from their own fare, guaranteed to scald your mouth and make you sick.

Driving south from Maricopa I couldn't help noticing the sign "Grilled Fish Tacos." To my surprise, I pull into the strip mall parking lot to find a dude with a gas powered burner plate. He tells me to pay for the tacos inside, so I purchase two at 3.00/ea.  I give him the receipt and he proceeds to batter two pieces of fish and adds a bunch of oil while it cooks. My first thought is this is not grilled, but fried, but I decide not to make a fuss. When it's done he hands me two tortillas each with a piece of fried fish the size of my pinkie finger. I go back inside the coffee shop to show the tacos to the lady at the counter. She responds by directing me to a tabletop area with some exposed condiments, and proceeds outside to reprimand her employee when it (the size/quantity of the fish) was no fault of his. Instead, it's the management that decides to charge 3 dollars for about 30 cents worth of food. Never meant to be lunch, but merely a snack.  I'm sure their coffee and other menu items are decent, but they should stay out of the taco business! Take my advice, if you're in the mood for fish tacos and have the unfortunate experience of being in the Casa Grande AZ area, ignore the sign and head further into town to Rubios or some other place that's known for fish tacos.

My car's condition was accurately diagnosed and repaired to satisfaction within a given estimated time frame.  They're not cheap, but they are competitive, fair, and as far as I can tell, honest.

A surprise find in otherwise depressing Casa Grande. Second time eating here. Good cubano sandwich, not the best, but good. Had their Ropa Vieja dish the last time which was great.

Delicious! Between the chicken and the steak plate, the generous serving of expertly grilled marinated beef wins hands down!

Both the beef chow fun wide noodle, and the mixed vegetable with lightly fried tofu, were excellent. The noodle dish was among the best I've had, which was portioned just right for three hungry people, and was free of any excess oil. The vege dish was a colorful medley of quality freshness and variety. Combined with quick and friendly service, I'll be back for more!

While waiting for service on my motorcar a few blocks away, I stumbled across a historic church bldg dating back to 189something that was converted into a restaurant, specializing in unique and equally tasty tacos like "thai coconut curry red snapper." Among an otherwise ubiquitous landscape of corporate empires, a unique find indeed. Why not 5 stars? They forgot to give me a place setting (fork and knife). Otherwise great service.
