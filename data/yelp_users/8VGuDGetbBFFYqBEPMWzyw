I work downtown, and this is one of our regular haunts on Fridays when we go out as a group.  I typically get the Skyscraper on an onion roll.  It's piles of corned beef and pastrami, topped with swiss, on an onion roll, then served with french fries and a pickle spear.  The guys and ladies behind the counter are always awesome, and they even come around and pick up your trays when you are finished!  Though it's not the cheapest lunch (around $10-11 for my lunch with a drink), it's not out of the normal range for lunch downtown.  And you will never go away hungry.  This is definitely one of those places you will go and need to take a nap after lunch.  I can't recommend Downtown Deli enough, it's one of my favorite places to eat in Downtown Phoenix.

We had a lot of fun here.  This was our first trip to the park, and we were looking for a trail that wouldn't be too hard for my wife (who has fibromyalgia) and would be good for the kids.  We decided to try the Waterfall Trail.  The trail is not too hard, and gets a little tougher as you go up.  it is paved for about the first quarter mile, maybe a bit more, then turns to a marked dirt trail.  It had recently rained, and the water was flowing when we got to the top.  Though we couldn't see the waterfall proper (you had to climb over a large rock to get to it, and I didn't think it was safe for my boys of 4 and 7), we got to the end and the boys thought it was a lot of fun.

My wife and I live in Goodyear, and we decided to drive up and check out Archie's on the recommendation of a friend.  We have lived in the Valley for about 3 years, and I have become a fan of The Downtown Deli in downtown Phoenix, which was actually the first corned beef and pastrami I had ever had.  To me, this place was ok, but in comparison to Downtown Deli, it was quite lacking in value and taste.  I got a Double Jeopardy on an onion roll, which is corned beef, pastrami, hot and regular mustard, as well as swiss and muenster cheese.  Upon taking the first bite, I knew something was missing.  The taste just didn't seem to be there.  I couldn't taste much mustard at all (there was very little on the sandwich), and the meet was not as I have become a fan of.  I am used to good corned beef and pastrami melting in your mouth, and this definitely did not do that.  Even after putting the Hebrew National deli mustard on the sandwich, it seemed a bit bland.  Now, I'm saying it was "bad" necessarily, maybe I have become spoiled by Downtown Deli.  But for the $35 we spent (just meals for my wife and I plus tip, the kids eat free after 4), I wasn't impressed.  I think the pricing was a little bit much, $2-3 cheaper would have been more reasonable.  Especially with the quantity of the sides.  We both got potato salad, and is was served in a small plastic cup like you would get your fruit in at and elementary school (see the picture of the applesauce).  For $11.50 (for my sandwich), that's just not enough.

I had actually never had Greek food before I moved to Arizona in 2006.  Since then, I have fallen in love.  Typically, I eat at Athenian Express in downtown Phoenix, as it is near where I work and I go with coworkers.  This last week, I wanted to get my wife to try Greek, so I took her here with the kids.  I like Athenian, and this place is better!  The meat is piled on the Gyro, and the fries are great.  Feta is an add-on for $.50, but well worth it.  Overall, you just can't go wrong!  Plus, as an appetizer, they have a pot of soup sitting there for you to help yourself too while you wait for your food to get done.  For free!  The only negative we had was my son had the spaghetti, and he didn't really like it.  It didn't have any sauce like normal Italian-style spaghetti, and it had a cinnamon flavor to the meat.  I don't know if this is a traditional Greek thing.  I thought it was still pretty good, but he didn't like it.

I was quite surprised.  I came here expecting decent burgers, and I was pleasantly surprised with better food than I expected.  The warning I give here is that the burgers are pretty greasy, but the taste is great.  I got the Arizona Smashburger 1/2 lb (no guac and no tomato) and haystack onions.  The burger was quite large (though more wide than thick) and juicy, the toppings were fresh, and the bun was great, adding a nice complement to the rest.  This may not have been the best burger I have ever had, but it was good enough that I will come back and eat here again.

My entire family loves this place.  The thin crust pizza is a great, New York style.  The bread sticks are awesome, and even the calzones don't disappoint.
