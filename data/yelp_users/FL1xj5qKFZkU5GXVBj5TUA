When I miss my sweet home Chicago, I make a bolt for Chicago Hamburger Co.  Sure the hell beats dropping a G on round-trip tickets!  Sliders are a buck.  Same idea as White Castle, butt this joint is easier on the butt.  Chicagoans or anyone who has tried whiteys will know what I mean.  They're served on soft fresh buns with fresh onion and pickle.  The fries are damn good and don't taste like they were just pulled out of a freezer.  Don't leave without trying a Chicago style Italian Beef with sweet and hot peppers.  The bread so super soft and fresh and all of the peppers taste like they were made right there in this dive... in fact, I think I could see a bowl of fresh peppers from the counter.    Service is good and the environment and decor can't be beat!  All Chicago, everywhere!  Stuff you don't normally find in AZ, these guys know Chicago.

Management needs to wake up.  This location is full of lazy, slovenly, disinterested and unhappy looking employees.  Bathrooms need more regular maintenance as do all of the games.  Just about every game has something wrong with it.  Instead of fixing the game when I reported a problem, they just gave me a coin.  No apology and no effort to put a sign on the machine or fix it was made on any of my visits here.  You can spend $50 playing games here and not earn enough to buy anything worthwhile at the prize counter.  This place is a racket!    Salad bar is neglected, but surprisingly the pizza service has been OK the last few times I've been here.  To put that in context, the pizza is of course not good, but at least it was hot and edible.  2 stars is generous and I only give it that because at least the kids have been happy.  Get a competent manager who cares and this location can be decent.

Oh bomberro burrito how I love you so.    Their homemade spicy sauce is the tastiest blend of hot spicy flavor and sweetness that I've ever had.  It's basically ketchup with lots of spice, but wow is it good.  They should package this stuff and sell it!    I order the carne asada, but I'll warn you it isn't the best carne asada I've ever had.  It's above average, but sometimes overcooked.  It lacks sufficient marination and seasoning to be considered among the elite carne asada in the valley, but it's fresh and grilled to order, so you can't complain.  Their fish tacos are above average as well as their other tacos.  Their rice and beans are average as well, but nothing spectacular.  It's a bit over hyped, but I would recommend it just for the bomberro burrito and decent prices.

I love Hawaiian food and only found this place thanks to Yelp.  I have driven by hundreds of times and didn't know it was there.    The service was awesome, I asked for a little help and the wonderful lady behind the counter offered tons of advice.  She was incredibly passionate about the food and raved that they had the best food around.  I instantly loved the place and I hadn't even taken a bite yet...  I ordered the Bulkogi thanks to the yelpers reviews and they were right!  The fresh grilled taste and perfect korean bbq marinade put this over the top!  Also their mac-potato salad was amazing with hot sauce!  My wife ordered the laulau pork place and the lady was right, this was some of the best I'd ever had.  One suggestion:  ask for terriyaki sauce or something to go with the pork.  Though it was perfectly cooked and seasoned, it needed something to put it over the top.    I'm going back to try the short ribs ASAP!  Check this place out!  A gem!

Went on a Sunday at yelp's recommendation and was pleased with the food, but my overall experience wasn't great. The douche who took my order told me ten minutes and when I arrived exactly ten minutes later, he says, "That was fast!  I just put your order in right now!"  I was thinking this food better be damn good you knucklehead...  I ordered the 222 Breakfast with 2 Pancakes, 2 Sausage and 2 Eggs.  The eggs were perfectly fluffy and seasoned to perfection and traveled well for a pick up order.  The breakfast sausage was really good and I am very picky about good breakfast sausage.  It was fresh and cooked very well.  I ordered a side order and demolished them also.  The pancakes were thick and fluffy, very very good pancakes!  My wife ordered the cinnamon french toast and while she just thought it was good, I thought they were the best I'd ever had!  I almost had to pull the car over in the middle of traffic on my way home to take a bite.  The smell was intoxicating and literally almost drove me insane on my short drive home.  Overall very good food, but the guy who took my order was not with it.  The only redeeming quality of the customer service was the nice young lady who handed me my food with a smile.  Oh and did anyone mention it's behind the Home Depot? hahah  PS - No wait on Sunday at 9am, got right in.  Plenty of seats, but it was starting to fill up at about 9:30am

Sure the food is good, but out of my last 20 take out orders they got it right maybe once.  The people making the food look so high you would think you were at Cheba Hut, but I just love that damn Broccoli and Wisconsin Cheese soup!  Their fresh dark rye bread is always great.  I enjoy the Italian quite a bit and the wife LOVES their tuna salad.  Great healthy place for food if they aren't too high to get your order right.

Show me a better hot dog in AZ!  I'm from Chicago and this is a good dog!  I can't get enough of the spicy relish. You have to try it!  The service is usually horrible, but that is something I've come to love about hot dog joints coming from Chicago.  Ted's is great and it's really inexpensive!  Oh and they finally accept debit/credit cards!

Don't come to this place!!!  I want it all to myself!  They upgraded everything recently.  Recliners are awesome, but don't come here because I love that this place is kind of a Gilbert secret.   Nestled in the back of a big parking lot, we usually get in and out and always have a good experience.  The recliners here fully recline, matinee price is only $5, and there is a ton of space between you and the next row.  They've basically eliminated the ability for idiots in the theater to ruin your experience with chatter and bright phone screens... They're so far away that unless they're in your row, you can't be bothered!  They take seating seriously and check regularly during the movie.  Get the royalty app or card, best perks of any theatre... But yeah, don't come here.  It's still a chill spot.  Let's keep it quiet.  Capisce?

Another place I checked out thanks to Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.  However, I was a little disappointed overall.  The food was really good, don't get me wrong, but the place was empty and the food was not piping hot as you would expect as the only guests.  Maybe we just came at a bad time, but everyone still really enjoyed the food.    I had the ribs and although they were still tender and tasty, it felt like they had been reheated.  The bbq sauce was excellent!  My wife had the pulled pork and she thought it was really good also.  I thought the pulled pork was definitely above average, but again probably not as hot or fresh as I would have liked.  You gotta try the deep-fried twinkie... highlight of the afternoon!  SO GOOD!

This gem has everything an Italian or anyone with good taste could desire!.. and they appear to be family-owned and offer excellent customer service!  I had the Italian Sausage and peppers sandwich on Italian bread and they told me it was an excellent choice... no doubt it was.  It was a top 5 quality fresh homemade Italian Sausage.  I was skeptical that the sausage was sitting under a heat lamp when I arrived, but it was clearly still very fresh and out of this world delicious.  My colleague ordered the hot pastrami and was told it was the best in the state.  He could not argue with that statement and at the first bite said he'd be coming back many times.  I've since come back and tried the Itallian Stallion, which was excellent!  You can't go wrong at this place, so much to try and it has a FULL Italian grocery, deli and bakery!  They have everything from fresh homemade frozen pizzas, veal, seafood, endless pasta selection, imported wines and cooking oils, etc.  I am going to spend a lot of money at this place, my wife should probably take the amex away now.  You gotta try this place!!!

Went back and picked up the best canolis I've ever had along with some delicious NY Cheesecake, Romanelli's pasta sauce, imported pasta, Wise potato chips and Italian cookies.    It is now very clear to me that you absolutely cannot go wrong at this place.  I'm comfortable trying anything and everything there.  I would go every day if I could.  Great food, Italian grocery, deli, etc.

Checked this place out for a Thursday lunch thanks to the great yelp reviews and interesting menu.  Head's up, if you get there before 11:30am you may be the 1st person to beat the lunch crowd.  The placed filled up by the time I left at 12:05.  First off, I would go here again just for the salsa.  It was fresh and sweet, yet deeply spicy.  The sweet of the salsa would coat your tongue just before the spice overwhelms it.  So good!  I ordered the Carne Asada spicy.  It came with rice, lentils and fried plantains.    The lentils were similar to pinto beans, but added a new dimension to the dish.  I was not a fan of the plantains.  They were room temperature and extremely bland.  They made the dish look very appealing though.  The meat was very difficult to cut, but well cooked and the spicy sauce was very good.  A different, yet refreshing take on typical carne asada plates.  It was extremely hot and spicy - just the way I love it!  I was sweating bullets by the time I left.  Only downfall was the service wasn't great until he dropped off the check.  That was a bummer after all the positive reviews about Mi Cocina Mi Pais' friendly service.    I could hear the couple behind me talk about how "everything here is good."  I'll be back for more soon.

A rare yelp disappointment!  Just a touch about Filiberto's and that's a very generous compliment.    I ordered the two carne asada burrito combo with rice and beans.  The rice was bland and room temperature as was the beans.  My wife chewed on something that definitely wasn't carne asada and had to spit it out.  My carne asada was rubbery and just average at best. Everything about this place was a disappointment, even the prices which I thought were actually high for a hole-in-the-wall that you have to look hard to find.    Do yourself a favor and get a carne asada somewhere else.

Whenever I want to take my wife to a romantic Italian restaurant, this is the place.  You will typically be greeted by one of the owners of the restaurant and the service is always first class.  My wife and I have had some of our most memorable dining experiences at Lo Cascio's.  Every time I go, I'm always shocked that Lo Cascio's does not have a line outside with patrons clamoring to get inside for this authentic southern Italian food.  I come from a southern Italian family and am extremely picky when it comes to Italian food because, as far as I'm concerned, my grandparents did it best.    Lo Cascio's feels like I'm eating at my Italian grandparents house again.  The red sauce is clearly prepared fresh and an authentic southern Italian treat to say the least!  We come to this place as often as possible and have tried lots of items: My Favorite?  The fried mozzarella marinara appetizer.  Simply the best dish of its kind.  The waitress always replies, "Excellent choice!"    Bruschetta appetizer comes with fresh baked bread and is absolutely delicious.  Pizza appetizer - Last time we went they had a special extra thin small pizza that was out of this world!  The pizzas here are incredible as well!  Skip pizza hut or that other crap, and pick it up here for cheaper!  Italian Sausage and Peppers - I don't know exactly what they call it, but it's great!  The sausage is among the best I've had and the dish was perfectly cooked and tasty!  Meatballs - I always get a side and never come away disappointed.  Be sure to have the fresh parmesan topping it off!  Cheese Manicotta - One of my favorite dishes, the ricotta is out of this world and always cooked perfectly  I can go on all day about how great this restaurant is, in fact I signed up to yelp to get more people to check this place out!  You will love it!

I've been going here for lunch for over 6 years now.  Clearly a family owned joint that cares about making each customer feel valued and welcome.  Listen, it's not the greatest food in the world, but for the price and service it's damn good!    I LOVE the hot and spicy chicken or beef.  My mouth waters very time I think about smothering it in Sriracha sauce.  The veggies and rice are good, but there are times the veggies could be fresher.  There are other times it's great though.  I usually ask for extra veggies so i can pretend I'm being healthy.  Well, that, and the fact that they don't give you much with the regular sized plate.  The extra veggies are free too.    The teriyaki chicken is very good as well as the bulgogi.  The food is cooked fresh and the service tells you that they are really doing everything they can to make you happy.    Check it out for a quick lunch, but beware there can be long lines around 12:45.  It's hit or miss.  If its too busy check out the Original Hoagie Shop next door for amazing food and service as well.

My favorite burger joint in az.  I don't throw that statement around, so try it for yourself.  The burger is cooked fresh, not frozen, over an open flame.  The onion rings are fresh and you can truly make it your way at the condiment bar.  Only bummer is that it's cash only, but nothing will keep me away from a chuckbox burger.  I wish they had drivethru.

This is Tempe's greatest kept lunch spot secret.    The food is always super fresh and delicious.  The service is awesome and its family owned.  They also use a lot of local fresh food.  For example, they get their hoagies fresh daily from an Italian deli nearby.  And it's some of the best bread I've ever had.  I've tried everything on the menu and I've been a regular for several years.  If I had to recommend one thing on the menu it'd be the Italian Cheesesteak (add mayo, lettuce, tomato to make it 'hoagie style').  They grill that bad boy up fresh every time.  The soups are great too, my favorite is a tie between the Albondigas and Broccoli Cheese.  My wife enjoys the tuna or turkey.  You can't go wrong, check it out!

I feel bad for anyone who hasn't discovered this place yet.  My new favorite pizza place in Arizona... I've been searching for years.  Nestled in the deep corner of a dimly light strip mall and beneath a huge old clock, Classic Italian Pizza is full of patrons who are raving about the delicious wood fire cooked pizza, salads and the best tiramisu this side of the Mississippi.  We're overjoyed that we've discovered this place.  This is an expensive classy pizza joint, serving Italian-style thin crust pizzas with all the freshest and highest quality toppings.  The pizzas come in one size, 12".  Your meal comes with fresh wood fired italian bread.  I highly recommend dipping the bread into their house dressing, absolutely amazing!  Speaking of which, the fresh salad and their house dressing were among the best we'd ever had.  It's hard to find a good Sangria and since everything was tasting so good, we decided to give it a shot.  Strong, but perfectly tasty.  This is a very good drink.  We ordered the Italian Sausage, which comes with chopped mushrooms, green peppers and onions.  Naturally, I had to add pepperoni to this pie.  OUT-OF-THIS-WORLD EXCELLENT!  Wow, I'm coming back many many times and screaming from rooftops about how good this pizza is.  I'm from Chicago and hate just about everything in Arizona, so you can see my excitement in finding this place.  We've also since come back and tried the four seasons pizza, which is basically split into four different sections; each with proscuitto, parmesan, and tomato sauce: tomato, olive, artichokes, mushrooms.  The tomato was so damn good we will definitely be ordering this again.  The service is great, obviously a family run operation.  The same three people were working there each time I've come.  The talk to each other in Italian sometimes and are very passionate about what they do.  You will never find this place if you don't look for it!

Customer service is hit or miss at this location... Mostly miss.  The cooks are good though, very consistent.  My favs are crab wontons, Mongolian beef or spicy chicken (extra spicy) and fried rice.  You can't go wrong though.

Three words: Jade. Red. Chicken.    That stuff has been on my mind constantly since my first reluctant trip to Chino Bandidos.    My wife and I were on our way to try this place when we both chickened out because the menu and ordering was so weird and different.  Big mistake.  They have a guy there who literally walks you through the menu, ordering and gives you samples of their main dishes, rices and beans.  I was excited to place my order by the time I finished tasting everything.  I ordered the Jade Red Chicken and BBQ Pork burrito with Chicken Fried Rice and black beans.    I should have ordered a bucket of jade red chicken because that stuff is amazing!!  It pissed me off that the BBQ Pork had to share the plate with it.    The BBQ Pork didn't have a chance, plus it was bland and boring anyways.  I should have ordered the jerk chicken rice instead of the chicken fried rice.  It had some weird spices in there that turned me off.  The black beans were excellent!  Spicy and very different!  Don't be scared to try this place.

We have a new favorite Mexican restaurant...   Rancho De Tia Rosa was packed by 6:30 on Saturday night.  We called ahead (no reservations for groups less than 10) and had to wait about 5 minutes before we were seated.  Then came the red and green salsa with chips.  At first taste, after hearing all the yelp love for this stuff, I thought it was good but didn't see the hype.  Next thing I knew I had ordered a total of three extra salas.. both red and green.  This stuff is amazing!  The red salsa was fresh and not spicy at all, but was perfect for both dipping and topping off my beef carne asada fajitas.   The green salsa was sweet, but not too sweet and had an intoxication about it that made me continue to eat it long after I was full.  We tried the taco sampler (carnitas, beef, chicken).  All three were very good, but we were practically fighting over the carnitas and beef.  While the chicken was very good and clearly fresh, the carnitas and beef were too good to ignore.  Make sure you squeeze the lime on your carnitas.  I had the beef carne asada (mexico city fajitas) w/ roasted vegetables, rice and beans.  Everything was perfectly cooked and had a delicate roasted taste to it that put each item over the top.  It seemed literally everything was freshly cooked over an open flame by someone who clearly took pride in what they were doing.  The way they slow cook the meat for 10 hours and then grill over an open flame combines for a taste sensation that can't be missed.  The meat is among the most tender and was probably of a good cut.  You wouldn't know because it was perfectly seasoned and melted in your mouth.  My wife had the beef chimichanga which also was delicious.  The chimi was perfectly cooked fresh and not greasy.  We finished our meal off with the fried ice cream with strawberries.  This is a must try!  All the ingredients perfectly meshed together and the strawberries put it over the top.  Only negative of the night was our 'chips and salsa boy', who we coined "Slammy Sosa" because he angrily slammed down our salsas.  We think it was because he forgot to bring them a few minutes earlier.  This kid seemed to hate his life and became clearly disgusted when I asked for a green salsa (he only brought the red, come on dude!!).  We laughed about his nickname for the duration of the meal, so it wasn't a big deal.... but he almost cost this place a star.  Oh and I would definitely recommend this place for kids.  It was very loud because it was packed, so you don't have to worry about that.  Also they had the BEST balloon artist we'd ever seen.  He was very loud and funny.  The kids loved him.  He made some of the most amazing things from balloons, including a basketball hoop hat

Holy pancake orgasm, Batman!    The richest. smoothest. buttery-est, fullest, fluffiest, tastiest cooked-to-perfection pancakes you'll ever eat. Those of us who haven't had the pleasure of dining at Matt's thought we knew a good pancake... WRONG!  Matt's is where it's at, 1/2 hr-1 hr wait and all (We were seated in 1/2hr Tuesday @ 10am).    The restaurant is very busy, so one cannot expect the servers to build rapport with the customer.  Rather it's more important they keep my coffee and OJ full with a smile, which they did well.  I had the ribeye, eggs and home fries, which was one of the specials of the day.  While my steak was cooked medium when I requested medium-rare, it was delicious, well cooked and seasoned to perfection.   Eggs over easy done text-book as well, fresh, hot and you can't get any better.  The portions on most of the orders seemed small, so we had to order some sides which drove up the bill total.  The menu can be inexpensive if you just order one thing, but there are so many great things to try!.. like the fresh strawberry preserves!  Hands down this is best breakfast gem in Arizona and I can't wait until we can go back!

Best beef brisket I've had yet.. and I don't normally like beef brisket.    I had the lunch sampler thing at the suggestion of my bartender, who was friendly and helpful.  He also suggested the mac-n-cheese and although I didn't feel like mac-n-cheese I tried it.  This stuff was so damn good and the hot sauce he suggested I put on it was out of this world!  The cornbread was also a highlight of the meal.    The sampler included ribs, bbq chicken and beef brisket.  Each were perfectly cooked, seasoned and super tender.  Of course I would recommend getting a little extra bbq sauce on the side, my preference was the hot which I loved!  They finish the meal off with a bag-o-donuts.. basically sugared doughballs.  Nonetheless they were very tasty and a nice, different take on a dessert for a bbq meal.  It was also nice that the bartender didn't scoff when I asked him to switch the tvs to ESPN (who wants to watch the news in the bar anyways?).  Not only that, but he put it up on all the tvs and raised the volume.  I had a really great lunch there and will be returning soon.

You know that feeling you get when you walk into a restaurant and everyone seems miserable to be there?  Why did I ignore that feeling and eat at IKEA on a Friday morning?    To say the service sucked would be the understatement of the year.    The lady behind the counter was rude, unkempt, and didn't make a lick of eye-contact.  They didn't have any sausage ready, despite the fact that the joint was empty.  No apology for the 10 minute wait for sausage while the rest of my order sat on the side and got cold either.    Don't bother with this place people.  There's a reason breakfast is .99.  They should pay you for experiencing that kind of customer service and crap food.    Oh, and they don't have coffee cups for your to-go order, so thanks for making me pay for a coffee that I couldn't even take with me.  Why even offer a to-go option if you are going to half ass the entire experience?    The preserves that give you with your 'pancakes' -- if you dare call those thin pieces of shit 'pancakes' -- are terrible too.  Just terrible.  Lame, and you should be ashamed of yourself IKEA.

Irony: huge line of people waiting to eat at the pizza joint next door while there are plenty of tables available at the much better restaurant next door.  That's right.  Phoenicia is a better restaurant than Sal's Gilbert Pizza.  Much better and the service is better too.  The most delicious, hot and fresh gyros in the valley.  Bar none.    They give you bigger, hotter chunks of meat than any gyro I've had.. And I've had many.  I was impressed with their meat quality and consistent freshness.    The Greek fries are incredible too.  They look kinda gross, but don't let that deter you.  It's like feta cheese w ranch over fries... But better.    The kids loved the Nutella dessert and everything was well priced.  The also have a ton of fresh made in house Greek pastries that folks were snatching up.  They looked and smelled amazing too.  So don't be a nincompoop and wait in a long ass line next door when you can sit right down here and get better grub.    Seriously let's help this business thrive, they deserve it.

I'm such a friggin' idiot that I just recently discovered this joint.   Hands down, my new favorite place to eat.  On our first visit, I tried the original 'auggie', which is essentially steak and potatoes.  It was fresh, hot, seasoned perfectly and absolutely melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  A decent cut of meat and it went along perfectly with the red wine sauce pairing.  The wife had the chicken pot pie and loved it.  The proverbial cherry on the top was the dessert PB&J sangwhich.  Best.thing.ever.  Oh and they have a great beer menu.  This place rocks!

It's shocking when AZ yelpers get Mexican food wrong.  The fact that this shit hole has a 4 Star average is comedic.  I took my wife and kids here for the second and last time over the weekend.  I'd ordered the carne asada burro the last time I was here and it was OK for a dive, but nothing special and it didn't taste fresh.  This time was one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had.  I shudder to call it a "dining experience" at all.  First of all, they had some unhappy, unfriendly, unkempt high school chick working the counter.  She didn't say hello or make a half assed effort to offer decent customer service.  After I sat my family at a dirty table, or at least the cleanest in the place, I reluctantly ordered the pollo asado and rolled tacos.    The rolled tacos tasted like they were frozen and reheated.  Not fresh, bland, boring, and I'm not convinced it was beef.    The pollo asado was also clearly not fresh and the meat looked like turkey pot pie pieces, except this was no comfort food.  These chunks of meat had the consistency of rubber and the color of ash.  And it tasted funny...  That's the best I could describe it, just didn't taste right.  We quickly informed the asshole working at the counter that the food tasted funny and asked if we could get something else.  She looked at me strange, like I farted, then asked me to yell across the room to tell the manager -- while guests were in there eating.  The lazy manager finally stammered over, stared at the food, never making eye contact, and asked, "What do you want me to do?"  No apology, just a dirty look and some slightly better shitty food.  Stay away from this place.  They don't care about customers.  They don't care about putting out quality food.  You shouldn't care about them.

My favorite place for wings.  Every one of their 15+ or so sauces looks delicious, unfortunately I fell in love with four flavors and just can't bring myself to try anything else!  The WIld is the 2nd hottest sauce they have and isn't a tripe dog dare type of hot, but packs a punch for those of us who love really hot stuff!   Honey BBQ is my wife's favorite and my 2nd favorite behind the Hot/Wild.  It is the perfect mix of sweet and bbq and the chicken is always cooked perfectly.  The pick up service is always fast and they are always friendly.  I go there to pick up wings before almost every Bears game during the NFL season.  It's the best!

To say Panchos sucks is a huge understatement.  It is gag reflex bad buffet food. I went back to the buffet a couple times just hoping there was something edible.  I must have thrown three full plates away.  Stay away! Go anywhere else.  I had to go out of my way to tell people not to even bother with this place!

I've heard good and bad about Grimaldis, but I love all styles of pizza so I had to try it.  If you are looking for good brick oven pizza, Patsy Grimaldi's is a nice choice.  This is a nice joint with a relaxing atmosphere and good service, but I still much prefer the other NY style pizza joint La Piazza al Forno.    Don't get me wrong, Grimaldi's is good and we will definitely go there again, but the menu is limited in comparison.  Grimaldi's only offers salads and pizza.  We had the Caesar Salad, which was excellent!  Very fresh lettuce and the parmesan cheese was delicious.  Easily among the best caesar salads I've ever had and reasonably priced.  My wife and I shared the small and there was plenty.  We then ordered a large Italian Sausage / Pepperoni.  This was a very good quality pizza with fresh ingredients.  Perfectly cooked!  I found the pepperoni to be quite different as they were sweeter than most and very small in diameter.    We also ordered the white pizza, which is mozzarella, garlic, basil, oil and absolutely delicious.  Again though we prefer the La Piazza's take on the white pizza, but this was also very good.  Also you must try the NY Cheesecake, awesome.  Oh and to the douchebags who go out of their way to talk trash about Chicago and Chicago pizza, go fuck yourself.

Bland, boring, terrible Mexican food... But hey, at least the customer service was good.  The salsa and margaritas were the only redeeming quality.  And it's hard to screw up salsa and margaritas.  We had the combo appetizer (quesadilla, chicken taquitos, potato skins stuffed w red/green chili, and nachos) and the chicken and steak fajitas.  The quesadilla was very greasy and it was the first time our kids called quesadilla "gross."  The nachos were just greasy cheese and beans.  Boring, bland and very greasy.  The potato skins were obviously reheated.  Also very bland and boring.   I've never had a place mess up fajitas, but somehow they did it.  I keep saying the word "bland" in my review because its the best way to describe my experience here.  The meat was so flavorless and when you're not using a high quality cut of meat, everyone knows seasoning is pivotal.  Terrible!     If this place could get a new head chef and menu and keep the great customer service, they could be OK.

Wow! Super tender, fresh, perfectly cooked carne asada on a toasted out of the world delicious torta! I cannot wait to go back! Authentic as it gets, decent service and amazing food! They didn't serve alcohol during lunch despite the margarita signs everywhere, but who cares?!? This place will make your taste buds happy, but beware you can get addicted on the first visit like me.  The service can be horrible, but I almost don't care.

Saw this joint on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives and immediately jumped in the car to check it out.  Nestled in Old Town Glendale this is the place to go for great pizza in Arizona.  I'm mad at La Piazza because now I can't order pizza from anywhere without comparing it to this place.  I'm constantly haunted by this place because it's so freaking awesome!!  We ordered the shrimp appetizer and bruschetta, both of which were fresh, perfectly cooked, absolutely delicious and arrived quickly despite poor and confused service.  Then we ordered the Italian Stallion and White Pizza.  The Italian Stallion has several different meats on it, one of which I have never tasted anything like it.  I believe it is the fresh Italian supressetta and Proscuito that puts it over the top -- along with the pepperoni and sausage.  DELICIOUS!  The white pizza is basil, garlic, ricotta and mozzarella and while the combination is simple, the taste is very surprising in that the flavors are robust and fulfilling despite the lack of ingredients. The first time we went, both of us loved it.  The 2nd time, my wife was less impressed, however I am still a huge fan of this  joint!  Guy was right.  UPDATE: Went back and tried the baked spaghetti... eventhough we could tell is had been cooked much earlier and reheated, it was very good.  The red sauce is among the best I've had, a classic southern Italy recipe just like grandma used to make.  You can't go wrong with anything at this place... well, except maybe the service.  Let's just say that hiring within the family isn't always a great idea.

Tastes like one of my favorite joints growing up on the south side of Chicago.  The service was great, very friendly staff.  They also have Eli's cheesecake.  One of the better Chicago pies in AZ and I've been searching for a long, long time.

I'm an Ono fan.  Most locations get a 4+ star review from me, but this location insists on putting the employees with the least amount of customer service skills in charge of dealing with customers.

I'm shocked to see there aren't many great reviews for Maria Maria.  My wife and I have been there several times, including a breakfast stop and always come away very happy.  The steak fajitas are so good my mouth is watering as I type this.  They give you several salsas with your meal and my favorite is the chipotle style creamy sauce that comes with the fajita.  This is the stuff that dreams are made of.    Also their guacamole is so good and fresh.  Love the salsas as well!  Everything else on the menu, though is a little off.  Don't bother with the mole, it was just gross.  Very cool decor and sometimes they have live guitar.  Very classy Mexican restaurant.  Go for the steak fajita, guacamole and salsa.

This was the only place near my house that had the Bears games on the big screen, so I have gone several times.  Put it this way,.. this year I shelled out the $ and got DirecTV so I didn't have to go to this dump anymore.    The service was pretty decent, but the food was wildly inconsistent and mediocre at best.    I've had a decent cheeseburger there, but I've also had one of the worst burgers there.  One time the wings were ok, the next time I could hardly eat them.  Once I ordered a breakfast burrito, which was actually really good but the salsa tasted old and almost bad and the country potatoes were definitely straight out of the fridge and undercooked.  They had $2 Coors, but that was about it people.  Don't eat there if you don't have to!

Probably the best carne asada and margaritas on earth.    The meat is fresh and a good cut.  It's been marinated perfectly and grilled over an open flame shortly within your order being placed.  I was hooked on the first bite.  The salsa is so fresh and delicious.  The perfect amount of spice and sweet and you can tell it is probably freshly prepared daily.  Don't even get me started on the Jamaica Margarita.  It is so damn good, I wanted to bathe in it.  I ordered two of them the first time I went.  I girl behind the counter came out to ask me if the margarita was good because she had just made the batch fresh before I came in.  I told her the only problem was the glass was too small.  You have to try this place.  Everyone I know loves it and I didn't know it even existed until a few months ago.

Meatgasm.  Meat.  Meat.  Meat.  Why thank you, Brazil!    This is a man's paradise.  Beautifully cooked and seasoned meat and all you can eat.  The first dude to flip his card to red is a sissy.  Don't make plans after you eat here. You'll be so full are you likely to pass out in the parking lot.  Brilliant!  My favorites include the filet mignon with bacon and the ribeye.  The mashed potatoes and plantains are also great!  The salad bar is nice too, but skip it and eat all the meat you can possibly fit in your belly.  The first time we came here some doofus refilled my Mai Tai with iced tea.  Before I could let my complaint roll off my tongue, there was a manager there to correct the problem.

Imagine the pickiest eater in the world.. then times it by a million.  That's my boss and most times I'm afraid to even suggest a place to eat to him.  He took me to this underrated downtown gem and I was instantly hooked.  First of all, if you don't know Indian food that's OK... Simply ask one of the servers for a sample.  They will let you sample everything but the made-to-order black pepper shrimp.  My favorites are the chicken vindaloo and butter chicken.  You must order some rice and garlic na'an to have the full taste experience.  This is why you see some yelpers complain about the sauciness and/or lack of fulfillment with their meals.  The spicy chicken briyan (sp?) is quite good, but has that all spice taste to it that always rubs me the wrong way.  My cousins are half Pakistani and I have had excellent Indian food.  This place is not far behind, so give it a shot.  And again, don't be shy to ask for a sample!

Yelp reviewers save the day once again with this Chinese delivery gem!!  Best damn crab puffs I've had in a long time!  This place has quality food, made fresh and they actually care about the presentation!  I didn't think Chinese delivery like this existed.  No more ordering from the other guys!  General Tso's chicken on fried rice was awesome.  Next time ill ask them to make it extra spicy because it wasn't very spicy or hot at all.  Nonetheless it was freshly cooked and still crispy unlike every other time I've ordered delivery from the other guys.  Mongolian Beef on fried rice was good as well.  The meat didn't taste like it had been sitting around in sauce for several hours like most Chinese fast food.  The even have great service and fast delivery!  The guy who takes my order calls me, 'sir.'  I like this place!

Lube shop is an absolute joke.  Sure, they're open on Sunday, but they've employed a bunch of freaking idiots.    I used to manage a Jiffy Lube for over 5 years and I never met an oil filter I couldn't get off.  These nincompoops made me sign a waiver because my oil was low and then called me 2 hours later to let me know they couldn't get my oil filter off.    I said, wow, ok you guys suck but can you please put a couple quarts of oil in my car and I'll pay for it?  Their response?  Nope, can't do it.  I laughed and said I had never heard of such a thing from a lube shop and to please put the manager on the phone.    Manager, Tony, came on the phone and was as pompous and idiotic as the first moron who picked up the phone.  They simply can't charge me to put a couple of quarts of oil in my car.  Told me I needed to come down and buy the oil and put it in myself.  Ok, you suck, but I'll come down and buy the oil.  Then I encounter a female assistant manager at the checkout desk chewing out an employee.  Didn't care that I was standing right here waiting for her to check me out, she just keep ripping this kid a new one over nothing for several minutes while I waited.  Stay away from getting your oil changed here.  Stay away from this Walmart if you can.

One of my favorite places to eat!  The BBQ Beef is the best I've ever had and the macaroni salad has been fresh and delicious every single time.  They take a long time getting your order ready, but its worth the wait because they obviously make it fresh and aim to please.  Put the hot sauce on your macaroni salad if you like HOT stuff... so good! I've also tried the BBQ Chicken, which was also fresh and delicious and the Chicken Katsu.  My wife and daughter loved the Katsu as well.  I've seen some negative reviews of this place and I'm shocked to hear them, so I had to write about how great this place is!  Go try it for yourself and try the BBQ Beef!  YUMMMMMMM!

Like some of the other yelpers to try this joint, I am a picky Chicago transplant who has been searching for a great Chicago place in the valley.  This place is pretty close.  Their deep dish pizza is worth the wait and you can clearly tell the cheese is the good stuff from Wisconsin.  The sauce is a little greasy, but a good semi-sweet sauce that brings the taste of the windy city to the valley. Their homemade sausage doesn't hurt the situation either, a very good sausage!  We also ordered the thin crust and my family from Chicago also enjoyed that pizza.  I thought the deep dish was excellent and much better than the thin crust.    Give this joint a try for the deep dish with sausage!

I drive 20min every time I need a cut because no one I've tried comes remotely close to this joint.  Every barber in this place is skilled.  They're good with my 5 yr old son too.  Cool guys, best spot around for a barber.  I wish they would bring back the shoe shine guy though.

Friendly, fast, honest!  Was in and out with my two vehicles in less than 30min.  Been going to Discount Tire for over 15 years and this was by far the fastest and best visit.  Thought for sure they'd recommend new tires and was planning on pricing them out. Instead, he said I could get some good life out of them if I rotated them and kept up on it.  It was almost like I was in an alternate universe with how friendly these guys were.  No one had an agenda. Ill be back!

I was too hard on Matta's in my first review.    Been back several times since and have to say so I really like this joint now.  Their chips and salsa are good, the service is friendly and fast, and their house margaritas feature good tequila!  Try the bean dip, the fajitas and finish it off with some fresh fried ice cream.  Your belly will thank me later.

Triple Ds.  Rad dudes, dudettes and delivery.  Thanks yelpers for introducing me to this Gilbert gem which combines great customer service, ridiculously fast delivery and fresh, quality ingredients.  The first time I called for delivery, some infectiously excited dude answered the phone and started recommending all sorts of ill shit -- from the Voodoo Chips to Buffalo Chicken.  Then he apologized that delivery would take 15 minutes... then the delivery girl showed up in under 8 minutes.  This young woman obviously broke some laws and land speed records getting these tasty treats to my doorstep.  And they do this every time!  They use fresh ingredients, including Boar's Head meats.  You can toast your sub as well. I've tried everything on the menu now and there isn't anything I disliked.  I would highly recommend the Buffalo Chicken, The Spicy Italian, Potato Salad and the Voodoo Chips.  I don't think they have a kids menu, but they'll make the kiddos a small three cheese grilled cheese as well as some other options.  Oh and their pomegranate vinaigrette is awesome too -- another recommendation from the kick ass dude who usually answers the phone.    Not only is this guy passionate about their food and fast delivery times, but I could tell that he enjoyed what he does.  If this guy doesn't own the restaurant, someone in management had better tap him on the shoulder and position him to train every location this place opens.  Employees like this make all the difference.    I'm a regular and can't get enough of this place!  My only critiques are that they need to stay open much later and could put more veggies and meat on their subs consistently.

What the HELL is wrong with you Yelpers who like this place?!    A rare Yelp miss, but an almost unforgivable miss.  I am tempted to write a letter to Yelp to audit the accounts who posted positive reviews for this place!  You're either tastebud deficient or a friend of the owner.  First of all, we should have walked out when we saw that two employees were just sort of lazily hangin' about and chatting it up in a booth in the back of the joint.  Both looked unkempt and disinterested; thought they for sure were just a couple of hungover college kids.  At first I thought they must be on break, but nope they were both involved in us getting our food.  Whoever is managing this place needs to get it under control.  Employees like that will kill your business!  The chips and salsa are a joke.  They are just sitting out there under a heat lamp with a sign that says, basically, please don't take too much so we can save money.  Uh,.. never seen something so remarkably cheap in my life.  Even the sign looked cheap, printed on some old paper, off center, and filthy.  The chips were hard and seemed to have been sitting out for a while and likely not fresh.  The salsa was below average and didn't taste fresh.  I am convinced the tomatoes were out of a can.  I tried their "specialty," if you dare call this piece of shit special, the Green Chili Pork Burrito.  Again, no way in hell was this fresh. Also bland and boring.  The rice was room temperature and the beans watery.  My wife thought hers was just boring and the kids barely ate it.  Stay away!!!

Overrated and flat-out nasty.    My stomach is still turning from the blandest, most boring, luke warm bacon cheeseburger I've ever had.  Anyone who gives this joint a positive review should be slapped and banned from yelp.  Absolutely gross, go somewhere else.

The hype is justified.  The most robust blend of high quality mouth watering gelato and excellent customer service.  The smiley, friendly and knowledgable young woman who helped us was quick to hand us sample after sample all while tossing a bits of knowledge about each flavor.  I sampled the Pistachio which was incredibly rich. She noted it was the most costly to make of all the gelatos (but the price was not higher).  After about 5 samples I settled on half cheesecake half black cherry at her recommendation.  I nearly inhaled the entire medium cup in 30 Seconds.  I found myself trying to slow down so I don't choke or die of a brain freeze.  Do they put crack in this stuff?!?  My wife got the cookies n cream... Though it's called by some super fancy shmancy name there.  So good, best she's ever had.    They also come with these little wafer cylinder shaped things that taste just like a fresh cone.  There was a super friendly kid walking around giving out samples to those waiting in the long line.  He was also passing out iced waters and making quick chit chat.  While we're gorging on our delicious treats they are playing a video of how they make their stuff.  We saw the espresso and gelato thing they make and decided we are coming back tomorrow!  So much to try!    Ok I'll shut up now.

Caramelizers, Pocahontas', and Snickers' oh my!  Ask about the secret menu.  This is my favorite location as a die hard DB drinker.  They churn people through the drive thru with a quickness, only use the walk up if the line is bonkers and few in line.  Otherwise drive thru always faster!  If you're really lucky you might see a guy dancing and playing flute in the parking lot.

Why the hell aren't there more glowing reviews for this joint?!  I'll attribute that to the fact that its in a casino in the middle of no-damn-where.  First of all, the honey butter with warm bread they give you to get started is incredible!  Fresh baked bread and the honey was literally poured over the butter!  So damn good!    Caesar salad.  Crab cake.  Both spot on, no complaints.  I had the Ribeye which was cooked perfectly and a beautiful cut.  Baked potato with all the fixings on the side was deelish. Creme Brûlée for dessert... Hell yes it was awesome!  We kept looking around the restaurant asking each other why the place wasn't packed.  Oh well, more for us!  NOTE:  This review was posted late.  Our visit was in February 2012.

LOVE this joint!  Our new favorite Mexican place, thanks to Yelpers!  Been there twice now in as many weeks, even took the kids.  I still can't get you out of my mind, Casa Ramos.  First of all, this MUST be a family joint because the service is incredible and you can tell they really care about pleasing you as a customer.   The chips are fresh and hot and they have a few different kick ass salsas.  Their 'house' salsa has the perfect amount of kick and chunk, they also offered us a milder sals for the wimpletons at the table, then they brought me the jalapeño habanero salsa.  All three were fresh and tasty as hell.  I bet you can't have just one bowl of chips.  I get the carne asada burrito with green extra spicy enchilada sauce.  The meat is super tender, perfectly grilled skirt steak.  It practically melts in your mouth and you can tell its a good quality cut of meat.  My wife gets the chicken and steak fajitas, which were aslo amazing.  To top it off, we had fried ice cream.  Definitely a hand made house recipe and also seemed fresher than any fried ice cream we'd ever had.  God I love this place.  So much so, I had to dust off my yelp account to let everyone know.  Go, now, don't hesitate.  Oh and great house margaritas!

Mountains of fries, no matter the size.  Seriously, they give you a laughable amount of fries.  Awesome burgers, a top 3 chain cheeseburger hands down.  High quality fresh beef, grilled fresh while you wait.  Get it with everything on it, add bacon.  You're welcome.

Not quite as good as the main location, but still kicks ass!  My only critique is that they don't serve a complimentary chunky salsa along with their hot salsa.    Get the agua fresca, try an appetizer (we like the queso dip w mushrooms) and finish with one of the many Torta options they have.    Personally, I love anything with steak at Los Reyes.  If they cook it fresh, it's incredible and very authentic!  My wife had the steak fajita plate thing and I had the steak Torta.  Her steak was obviously fresher and hotter.. Absolutely delicious!!!  Mine was warm, but not quite as freshly cooked.  Still tasty as hell, but I wish they were more consistent.  They have some cool fresh fruit options here.  Both in the agua fresca and in their dessert options.  Not too pricy either!  NOTE:  The main location was featured on Man vs Food (Food Network),  Adam had the loaded Torta (forgot the name but you'll see it!)

Oh the lady that took my order over the phone was super nice!!  This place must be awesome....  It pains me to give a bad review considering the customer service and delivery speed were both superb.  The food, on the other hand, was terrible.  We ordered crab puffs, chicken fried rice, and general tsos spicy chicken on fried rice.    The general tsos chicken was not spicy at all - despite the fact that I asked for extra spicy.  The chicken was soggy and bland -- clearly it had been sitting around and not fresh.  Instead of fried rice, I received white rice (sadly this was the best part of the meal).  The veggies were also soggy and clearly not fresh.    My wife had the chicken fried rice and very rarely does she give a negative review, but even she said it was her least favorite yet.  I noticed she had to put extra soy sauce on to enjoy it.    The crab puffs did not have enough filling, but had a nice crisp to it.  This item felt a bit overpriced for the amount of filling you get.  The sweet and sour was satisfactory though.  Overall this is your typical, hole-in-a-wall, low quality, cheap Chinese food that most people allow to pass as decent Chinese food.  The only reason I did not give a one star review is because they had excellent customer service, the prices are lower than most Chinese joints, and they delivered quickly - though that's likely because the food is not fresh.  My search for great Chinese food in AZ continues... SIGH

Midwest gem finally comes to Arizona!  You can't go wrong with anything in their menu, but you have to try the hot peppers on the side.  They are fresh made and delicious as hell!  Plus you can buy a big jar of it if ya want.  I've tried a few different soups and they are all fresh, hot and delicious.  The broccoli and cheese is among the best I've tried.  I am addicted to THE WRECK, so good.  Meat is generous portions, fresh, and seasoned well.  Get bacon.  Extra bacon if you can.  It's really good here.  The Italian is also near perfection.  Load up on veggies here!.. Nice and fresh and tasty!  Nice ambience, plenty of seating options (tall tables, inside/outside, etc), and good customer service.  This is one of my favorite lunch spots.  TIP Get there at 1130 or earlier to beat the weekday lunch rush.  BACON!!!!!  MORE BACON!!!!!

The bagel was super fresh and tasty, but I wish they had more bagel options.  They just opened though, so I assume more options will be coming later.   The Boston cream was fresh and hot, but the filling was missing something, tasted a little bland compared to other great boston cream donuts.    Coffee was too watered down, but if it was stronger/bolder it would be good.  Coupons are floating around like crazy right now, keep an eye open.  Great friendly service, appears to be family owned and operated.  I'll come again.

Ohh they toast their name on the bun, so they must be legit!  This place is new in town and people are flocking for their combination of great friendly service, high quality ingredients, and  huge selection.  The manager or owner of this place is really friendly and you can tell he truly cares.  I overheard a couple of conversations with his employees and could tell they all like and respect him.  This kind of work environment coupled with their trendy decor and super coke machine makes for cool place to hang.  My wife and I both had cheeseburgers and they were very good, however the portions are very small for the price.  I understand the meat is higher quality angus, but I was expecting more food when I pay $8 for a burger.  Their onion rings are excellent!!!  Must try these and they had many combinations you can too off your fries with.    Check in on social media and get a free ice cream.

Simply the best fast food chicken fingers around.  Always fresh, hot and juicy chicken.  I love their Cane's sauce, cole slaw and sweet tea.  Also always fresh and delicious.    They have a very limited menu, but they do their thing well.    You can buy a jug of their sweet tea or lemonade to take home too - but it'll cost you and arm and a leg ($7 for sweet tea and $9 for lemonade).

A new spot that we've made our new Friday night favorite.  Excellent craft beer, moonshine, and their dry heat spice rub is incredible.  Try the Scorpion Burger (Dry heat rubbed with jalapeño and spicy mayo) or the Steak Phoenix (Spicy Philly Cheesesteak) if you like a little kick.  Both if these tasty little devils have been making my mouth water since I left.  The waffles fries are good as well as the garlic fries.  My wife loves the grilled chicken sliders.  I had a bite and thought they were among the best chicken sliders I've ever had.  Decent kids options and great homemade, moonshine inspired cocktails.  The only thing I don't like is that their patio allows smoking.  We sat out there with the kids not knowing this and no one told us when they seated us.  We were stuck next to chain smoking jerks whose every other word was f@#&.  It was our fault for not checking though, so I won't let it affect my review.  This is the kind of spot that we want to see do well in the neighborhood.  The living social deal is going to put this place on the map.  It's already much busier.

Yelp you let me down on this one.  This joint is like the illegitimate love child of Filibertos and Chipotle.    I judge Mexican joints on their carne asada first.  If you can't do good asada, GTFO!    This was the most pathetic excuse of carne asada I've seen in a long time.  Several chunks were completed inedible - chunks of pure dense fat.  It was luke warm and clearly not fresh.  I had to stop eating my burrito because it was nothing but inedible chunks of fat.    The service was spotty at best.  The dude was friendly to one guy and then barely acknowledged my existence.  Place was not very clean either.    In Az we have a ton of good Mexican joints to check out.  This one should not ever be on that list.  I won't be back.

Bada bing cherry is the greatest thing I've ever had!!!  Every time I find a fresh piece of cherry, it's like I struck gold.  This is my favorite ice cream spot in AZ.  I have a Bahama Bucks and Dairy Queen near my house and I still drive 10min to go to Joe's instead.  They're different types of ice cream, but nonetheless I chose Joe's nearly every time.  They have awesome interior and exterior seating, loaded with old school memorabilia.  They've got an original Mrs. Pac-man, an old phone booth, old school barber shop chair/stuff, old gas station pumps, and more.  They always have a few special flavors of the day.  Try them, they give samples and are very friendly and helpful!.. Even with choosy, indecisive kids!  I've seen them give kids full ice cream come samples!  Try the Joe-Latti - basically Italian ice w soft serve nestled at the bottom.  They sell this stuff my the gallon!!   After you try it, you'll be considering loading your freezer with it!

Lean and fatty brisket, best I've ever had!  Great friendly service, well worth the wait, but very expensive.  Meat by the pound options and they always give out samples and water while you wait in line.  Get there at 1030am on weekdays to get a good spot in line.  I thought the jalapeño grits were a little bland, but the coleslaw and ribs both incredible and fresh!  The pickles and onions are a nice touch and go well with all the meats.

I was a Salad and Go fan.  You could call me a regular.  That ended today...  For the third time in a row, they messed up my drive thru order. I drove back today and complained for this first time.  Then when I got home and sat down to eat, I found a very long brown hair in my food.    While the customer service is usually good and food is decent, I will never eat Salad and Go again.  Nearly every time I go to this location, something is messed up.  Hair in my food was the final straw.    I encourage you to go something place else if you want healthy food, or just make it yourself.    You're welcome, because I probably just saved you a frustrating experience.

EAT THE YELLOW SNOW!    Crap this place is good and it's right down the street from my house!    Get the tropical creme for 50 cents added to your shaved ice.  Got mine with red raspberry and it was awesome!  Not your typical cheap shaved ice here, they are serving high quality stuff.  I didn't think there were quality shaved ice joints, but this place is cool and they have a lot of options and other stuff besides shaved ice.    They have board games, interactive social media music options on their jukebox and good service.    The only con is that their prices are a bit high.  I'd recommend getting a "Baby" size shaved ice for $2.99.  There is a lot of shaved ice in the small/regular sizes... Dare I say too much?

GET THE DEEP DISH (Pan)!!!!!!!!!!!!  My family is from south side Chicago and we all drove from various parts of the valley to check this joint out.  We quickly realized they don't have Indoor seating so we made the best out of sitting out on the patio.  We ordered 2 large thin crust pizzas - one sausage one pepperoni.  It was fresh, hot and had quality ingredients.  I would give the joint 4 stars for their thin crust.  It was really good for AZ, but in Chicago I would put it middle of the pack.  Now their DEEP DISH on the other hand is incredible!!!  If you've ever had Gino's East in Chicago, I would say this is very similar.  So damn good!  The tomato sauce is fresh and tastes perfect - just like home!  The sausage is excellent!  (That's what she said)  Get the deep dish damn it!!!

Simply the best.  Get deep dish buttercrust with extra cheese.  You can get it well done or gooey.  The Malnatis salad is the best salad I've ever had.  Get the cookie and ice cream dessert.    That's all you need to know.  Stop reading reviews and go get the best deep dish pizza on earth.  Just like Chicago.
