This place is a disgrace. Waste of my time and money. The DR clearly didn't care for me AT ALL. Just to make up some BS diagnosis so he could get me in & out.  The next day I scheduled an appointment with my PCP for some REAL help... They couldn't believe the BS that doctor made up to get me in and out. This was Sunday May 17th. I will never EVER come back here again. I am if the few who actually have to pay for my health insurance, not to mention my hefty copay for visiting the hospital, so you know damn well I wouldn't have come here if it wasn't an emergency where i was willing to sacrifice my money for some help.  The place was filthy, gross & needed a serious cleaning, let alone just a simple mop. They had some cracked out patient across the hall from me & a nurse had to sit outside her door & watch her, the nurse was letting her stand outside her room & say weird things to me from the hall. Finally closed the door, but I was astonished that the nurse just sat there & watched her annoy & creep the hell out of me.  I just will never ever come here again. The health care system is a JOKE here.

My food was terrible. Ordered chicken nuggets and French fries. Chicken nuggets were cold, and gross because they've probably been sitting out for 4 hours. My French fries. Total joke. I can't even tell you if temperature was good, because they were ALL hard as bricks... So burnt that they were hollow. Literally (will post pics). Thanks for wasting my time & money, total BS. Will never come here again.

My boyfriend wanted to go here.. I'm on a diet & im picky. Lol. I've ALWAYS ordered the kids chicken fingers with the penne pasta. Well, the manager came & took our order & he would not let me order it. So I sat there and watched my BF eat. We asked the server why we have never had a problem till now & he said that him personally (the server) lets people order whatever they want and that he'd talk to the manager again. Manager says they would give me that BUT it would be larger portions & charge me more. Forget it. This place is all about the money & couldn't care less about their customers. I will NEVER come to this Carrabas again.

Came in, couldn't find what I'm looking for, so I ask an employee for help & they give a terrible response "what ever is here is WHATS HERE" totally irrelevant, i wasn't asking you to bend over backwards & go check the back. Just wanted to know where it was located. After that, I took off & went somewhere else & won't be coming here again. There's another one on Bell that's better than this place. RUDE.

Excellent! I work nights, so finding somewhere open 24hrs is a hassle, ihop is always my go to for when I get off of work. I probably come here with my boyfriend every night around 1:30am or every other night... Food is excellent tonight! I never (and yes I mean NEVER) have any complaints. Food is HOT AND FRESH, couldn't be any happier with service & food quality/quantity/freshness. 10/10 would recommend. I'd say they need to hire more night shift people though, there's always one lady running around serving everyone at night but she is excellent & never loses patience & you'd never even know she was serving 8 other tables.

Do NOT come to this place!! False business practice, they agreed with my boyfriend they would just look at the car to see if they could see anything wrong with it NOT to be charged for anything. They wanted almost $400 to drop the gas tank just to "see" if that's the problem they thought it had. He did not agree to this. They charge him $140 just to make the call that it "could be this or could be that". They wouldn't let him take his car without paying the fee it is BLACKMAIL. They should've said upfront that it was going to cost $140, we would've said no.

I love it!! Cashiers are so friendly & very polite. That's honestly the #1 thing that makes this place so inviting. Kinda in a ghetto area. But inside the bowling alley it's so much fun. Will definitely come again. :)

Whatever female that was working the weekend on 10/11/14 needs to be FIRED. I went into this store to try out the beds & was not greeted by anyone. There was only 1 sales rep who was busy attending some older folks, which was totally fine... I don't like being bothered anyway, if I have a question I'll ask. I came in here with my boyfriend & let me tell you, we may be young & LOOK like we don't have money, but trust me, I could buy any of these stupid mattresses easily without even thinking about it. Money is not an issue. We immediately picked the nicest looking beds, inclined it how we liked (I have a blood circulation problem so I put the lower end up of the bed inclined) felt pretty good. We then turned on our sides to see how it felt from the side..... & this terrible hideous sales rep (who was adjusting her old folks bed as they were laying on it) told us "oh come on, if all you guys are going to do is play around then you need to LEAVE." I was disgusted!!! I looked at her & said "Excuse me"?!! At that moment she realized she was a complete IDIOT & rolled her eyes & continued talking with her clients. We immediately took off & guess what sweetheart???? We were going to purchase a bed but HELL no!! I am taking my business to temperpedic.    DONT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH JUDGMENTAL IDIOTS WHO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST YOUNGER PEOPLE.

Okay, so the people there were super friendly, I have nothing to complain about. But the food & the inside were very disappointing. I came inside.. ALL the tables were absolutely filthy. Not even just some little crumbs, I'm saying filthy. I ordered popcorn chicken, they were all mostly inedible. They were hard like rocks, probably only 3 pieces were ACTUAL pieces of chicken. Waste of my money. This visit was perfectly okay as far as the employees, but one time I came, I went through the drive through... You can see the person inside taking your order... I ordered all of my stuff & there was a pause... I see inside she has me muted & is laughing & talking to another employee. She then says "I didn't hear you, can you repeat?"  That was a very frustrating situation especially when I can see you. Oh well. Won't come to this location again.

I checked online for the "Ology Pure Castille" soap brand BEFORE I came in. Walgreens website has it for $4.19 & online it says that it was available in store to have it picked up now. So I went to the store, got there... The soap was $13.99!! So I go & show an employee the literal website with the price on it & everything. She said she can't price match it. Price match what, it's your own damn website? I asked why the hell would they have it on their website for $4.19 & that it could be picked up now if they can't honor their own price they have on their website. She said I have to order it online & pick it up at the store. How pointless!! She then said "I can go ask my manager but he's going to say no, I already know it". Such a waste of time & unbelievable that you guys are having almost a $10 markup. Such a rip off. Won't ever come here again.

I am honestly so disgusted with enterprise. I booked a Full size car over a month in advance, because I needed a car with HORSEPOWER 175+. I am going through Utah & these guys seriously screwed me over bad!!! They have ruined my entire vacation. When we got there, they had no cars. They had an SUV with 130 horsepower which is complete bullshit! how the hell can you rent out all your shit when you KNEW I was coming? They knew WEEKS in advance I would be coming. I'm seriously in tears right now, my whole vacation is ruined & now delayed. Do NOT depend on these people!!!

Rude. Rude. Rude. To the employees: if you hate your job so much then quit or get a college degree, don't hate on your customers because you choose to work here. But anyway, this place sucks so bad with customer service & food sucks half the time too. Came here at 10:50 (they close at 11), employees are probably ticked because we came right before close, an employee left right around that time & shot us a dirty look while leaving. When we ordered there were 2 separate orders. Myself & my boyfriends friend ordered 2 separate orders & when the girl showed up at the table didn't greet us or anything. Literally said nothing. Didn't announce who's orders were who's, just set our bags down & walked off. The most awkward & uncomfortable situation ever. No one here was nice, I smiled at the girl when we showed up (she was outside spraying off the concrete)... Totally gave me a dirty look & turned away. This place needs new employees because this isn't the first time my food has been cold or drinks watered down. Not coming here again that's for sure. Just go to Cane's that's just down the street, better food & customer service. :)

Mm mm MMM. this place is outstanding!! Excellent food, not to mention excellent service!!! My boyfriend & I dropped a pretty penny here, not to mention our server got a great tip for being so outstanding & helpful. Super cool guy, our drinks were always full, went above & beyond explaining all the food/dessert options they had, super polite. I have nothing to complain about. Food was promptly delivered. Thanks guys!

Here right now & I'm so irritated I'm about to just leave without paying. First off, walk in... Wait about 10 minutes to be seated. I assume the manager came to seat us, he seats us & the silverware is all jacked up. The napkin looked used & all ripped up & the guy clearly noticed it, apologized & was gonna bring us a new set. Soo we're waiting.. Waitress comes... I order Oreo cookie milkshake. She comes back & gives me this long story about how they ran out, etc... 10 minutes later comes back & apologized.. Apparently the barista played a joke on her & they actually weren't out of ice cream. Whatever ok, annoying. Meanwhile, still no utensils. So I asked waitress for utensils, she sarcastically replies "okay I'll get them even though  your foods not here, cause I'm sure you'll need them beforehand". Really irritated now. Get my food... Fries tasted like they'd been sitting, tasted old & not even remotely fresh or warm. To top it off, waited 15min for the bill. Don't come here.

Specifically asked for FRESH chicken nuggets multiple times throughout the ordering process. When we paid, we immediately got the food, which we thought was weird because it takes time to cook. We asked if it was fresh, the guy said yes. He is a liar. The food was disgusting. Chicken nuggets tasted so gross we threw them away. Never coming here again, I never have an issue with Burger King

Man this place needs some updates reviews! I've been steadily visiting this place often being as I just moved over in this area, & I gotta tell you this place is off the hook! Pizza is always hot & delicious always accurate. I got pizza tonight & I missed the galls name but I order pepperoni lovers (extra pep & extra cheese) ... MMMM she made some delicious pizza I am looovin in. She sure made sure the $2 extra dollars for extra cheese was well worth it. Excellent service even though I did order 15 min before closing time, no attitudes or crap pizza. Keep up the good service, I usually get pizza here with my boyfriend 3x a week, which is $30 every time. Keep the good pizza comin, & I'll keep the money flowin!!

My first time coming here, I'll definitely be back again! Very nice & friendly pharmacist. I unfortunately did not get her name, but I came around 7am after being discharged from the hospital. She noticed I still had my hospital band on, was very nice to offer to cut it off for me & throw it away (which I appreciated, walking around with that hospital band is a little embarrassing). Very nice gesture which she didn't have to do, but offered out of kindness. I had a prescription for Percocet  among another prescription. But I like how they didn't make me feel like a criminal for having a prescription for controlled substances. I've been a loyal Target Pharmacy customer for a while, about 2 years ago, I had a prescription for dilaudid from a surgery I had & EVERY TIME I came, they'd act like they've never seen that before & made me sign all kinds of BS & make copies of my ID... Always made me jump threw extra hoops that made me uncomfortable; like I was a criminal.   Anyway, I came here because they pharmacy is open 24/7 which is amazing, as I needed these filled ASAP! She had it done quickly & smoothly, honestly it was only about 5 minutes from the time I gave her my scripts to the time I was walking out with my meds. She was awesome, great service & very friendly! Thank you!

Good was fast, downside: cold food not even remotely warm & rude service. Thanks a lot, if you're gonna serve crap food, don't charge $6 for chicken strips that are cold & stale. Also, don't yell at me when I try to order a peppermint Oreo shake cause it's "no longer an option" yet you have 5 posters around the building promoting it. Bye.

We had Deric come out & help us today & he was terrific, super friendly & a pleasure to be around!  So I must admit, we (boyfriend & I) are idiots & thought our lock was broken on our door & called to have him fix it (was a Sunday afternoon, felt really bad wasting his time), but he came super fast, I mean maybe 15-20 minutes and we live on 59th ave & 101. He asked to see our keys & realized we were using the wrong ones. (Yes, I know, we are stupid). My boyfriend broke part of the lock & he broke the key he thought was for this door, when Deric figured out that one was broken, he asked if we wanted him to make another one so he could have the one he broke. He also replaced the lock that was on the door & gave us new keys for that too. Super fast & friendly. Wasn't annoyed or aggravated by our stupidly at all. I would definitely recommend these guys, and if I ever need them again, they have my business. :)

Fun to play games but the prices are a ripoff & the prizes are cheap dollar store items OR impossible to achieve decent prizes. People working there are incompetent & rude seemingly no common sense. I spent my hard earned tickets on "Kinetic Sand".... It's all over the place. It is NOT kinetic sand because it makes a huge mess!! Very disappointed with this place. First time coming here & will never come back.

Food was great!! Wish they had a location on the west side, but I will definitely come here again. The line was super long but surprisingly, it went by quick!!! Everyone only had to wait maybe 5 minutes for their food after the long wait in line.  Food was delicious!! The cheese fries are a little different, you have to acquire a taste for them because it's just totally different than what you'd think. Different kind of cheese. Food was hot and fresh... Was a little expensive though.
