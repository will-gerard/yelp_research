I want to try everything on the menu but the things I've already had are so good that I want them again every time I come!  Ugh!  #firstworldproblems   Nasu miso, gyoza, their sashimi, and their salmon cream sauce - personal favs.   But their RAMEN - unbeatable.  By far the best in the Phoenix metropolitan area.

Find another ENT specialist! This was the most unprofessional medical office I've ever visited. The ladies at the front desk simply sat and discussed their tailgating party the entire time and ignored my requests for an answer as to why it was taking over 75 minutes for us to be seen by the doctor. They were rude and condescending. I urge anyone seeking a professional, trustworthy ENT doctor to look elsewhere.

They were friendly on the phone when I called from a nearby salon where they were super rude to my friend and I for trying to walk in for mani/pedis at 1pm on a Saturday (how dare us) so we drove right over and were welcomed right into Above and Beyond. Neither of us have any complaints. Great color selection. Extremely cheap prices. Super friendly staff! And they did a great job. I don't live in this area so I thought I'd write a review to show my love because I'm not sure when I'll be back over here again!

I literally wouldn't be able to find ONE negative thing to say about Dr. Malek or his staff if I tried. He recently did my breast augmentation and I could not be happier with my results! Dr. Malek will give you his honest professional opinion about every aspect of surgery and follow through with his word. His entire staff is welcoming and attentive and made me feel at ease every step of the from my initial consultation to my post op visits. Since he is such a perfectionist, I will highly recommend Dr. Malek to anyone and everyone who asks!

Everything we ordered was EXCELLENT - pizza, green chile pork burrito, kids grilled cheese with bomb.com fries. The owner was extremely friendly and checked on us several times, which was great because our server was nowhere to be found the whole time. We will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu!!!!!

AZ Carpet Care was great!!! I was able to email them to coordinate with my apartment complex office to allow them access to my unit and get everything done while I was at work - so easy! They did a perfect job and their rate was literally 1/3 the cost that another company quoted me! I will DEFINITELY use them again. Thank you!

I love Red Devil! It's casual with great food and amazing service. Try more than their pizza... The wings, fried zucchini, and pasta is all good. Can't find anything I dislike about this place!

Sea salt Carmel, ranch, red velvet, Oreo... I can't stop coming here. Even the plain buttery flavor is amazing and highly addictive. I love this place and I wish it wasn't so close to my office because this is just not fair, I will never have abs.

High five Matt Carter - LOVE The House! Everything we ordered was fantastic, our service was great, and the ambiance was just perfect. Will be our new favorite place to sit outside on the patio at all winter long!

Sophie is literally the greatest. If she needed a kidney, I would give her one. Not only is she the sweetest most patient human being, she also makes amazing lattes. Minutes before they close. And she doesn't even get 1% mad that you are drunk and annoying. Sophie I love you.

Awesome service. Nails look great. I walked in and they were inviting and friendly instead of awkward like a lot of other nail salons. I would refer anyone to Emma's!

Although I was a pain, as I usually am, Rob patiently and kindly worked with me to find the best healthcare plan for me and my son while I'm in the middle of a stressful transition to a new career. Thank you so much for making my search for new healthcare insurance a simple and easy one Rob!!!

Update: When I needed to cancel my plan, Rob was nowhere to be found.  I sent 3 emails and called twice.  Of course he was great in the beginning when I needed to get set up, but after he got me on a plan and had me write reviews for him he disappeared.  I had to call my bank to put stop payments on my charges because he never gave me access to SurePay, then spent several days playing phone tag with BCBS to clear up the invoices for past due payments they started sending me.  Good thing companies like Zenefits will soon phase out sketchy brokers like this!!!

Update...This has very quickly gone downhill :(  It's such a great concept and was SO much fun at first but my last few visits have been extremely disappointing. I'll use my last visit to illustrate:  I finally got a chance to bring my dad to Top Golf. I already knew we weren't permitted to use drivers, woods, or hybrids (ridiculous) but we showed up at about 11:15am this day only to be told that as of THAT day, we can only hit our clubs from the first floor. This was a huge let down for me, especially since I had brought my new clubs with me. My dad goes with the flow so he said don't worry about it, the first floor is fine - because of course I wanted to play with my new clubs. So we were sent all the way to the end of the first floor (bay 103 to be exact) where the computers were broken, everything was dusty and dirty, and we got no service. Literally 25 minutes later we still hadn't even sat down, nor could we even get water because there wasn't a server in sight. Thirty minutes later, luckily we finally had a server and the computers were fixed because we had two other people that met us there about 11:45 to play. Our server was overly apologetic and awkward but at least the food was good.  It would have been nice if they had just offered to move us to a different bay? Not sure why they couldn't manage to do that.   I really wish they would come up with some kind of system where everyone has the opportunity to play with their FULL set of clubs and if you hit it over the fence once, that's it - you're out. I understand life isn't fair and they are "fixing the fence" or whatever but it would be so much more fun if we could use all of our clubs, on all of the levels, especially the girls! My boyfriend and I were planning on doing the Monday night tournament together but after this last visit we definitely changed our minds.  If I come back, it will probably only be for the nachos.

Maggie is so talented it's not even fair! She CARES about your hair, probably way more than you do! I first went to Maggie with dry, ruined dark brown hair and begged her to pour bleach on it... She refused. And I'm so glad I was patient and listened to her because now, less than a year later, my hair is not only platinum again but HEALTHY and feels amazing! I won't ever trust anyone else with my hair again... THANK YOU MAGGIE :)
