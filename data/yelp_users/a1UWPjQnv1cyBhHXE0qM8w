Went in and took my little niece to get her ears pierced and the staff was extremely knowledgeable, very friendly and a pleasure to deal with....along with good prices! :)

VERY EXPENSIVE, but one of the only places in town to find the stylish frames they carry. They are also great about replacing scratched lenses within the first year, which is something to take into consideration.

CLOSED. I went to go catch a drink and something to eat while I caught the game... only to find the place shuttered.

This place sucks ASS!!! The food SUCKS and they only got me in the place through misleading advertising a happy hour that they lead you to believe is one thing, you order what you THINK is on HR and then...WAMOOOO!!! HUGE BILL the owner threatens to then call the police on you unless you pay up.......... PASS and save your money for Goldies or Zipps right up and down the street.

Got some extra time on your hands? An agonizing, pulling teeth, experience. Someone fire the slow sushi chef, absolutely ridiculous! Good sushi if ya got the extra time and don't give a s#it about service.

I've been coming here off and on for the better part of twenty years. Hit or miss for sure.... but certainly a great place to pick up a bike if you need one, misc office supplies and computer cords and the like. The workers here have always been ok to deal with, but sure never excited about customer service, overly friendly out helpful. Maybe they receive instructions to be this way from the seasoned guys when they start, send to be the only explanation I can think of. :-)

Meat Lover's Pizza rocked!! Make sure and ask for Staci if dining in, she's da'bomb diggity when it comes to pleasant and attentive service, we simply won't go unless we call ahead and make sure she's there to wait on us.

Rather unremarkable Mexican food, chicken in the street tacos days roasted, was clumped bland unseasoned processed like you might find in a can at Costco.

We throughly enjoyed both the massage and float, along with the hospitality. Quite unfortunately, being situated between a boxing gym and a dance studio lent itself to distracting noises that really took away from enjoying the experiences for both of us. I think they should strongly consider relocation to a quiet location.

Cheese burgers, beers and...... a DISGUSTING dirty bar.... eat up folks..... good food, unhealthy dead bugs and rotting old food..... BIG DISAPPOINTMENT FOR THE HIGH PRICE for just a few beers and a snack too.... and we mentioned it to the bartenders and they just shrugged their shoulders and asked us if we wanted another. They are OK, but REALLY need to clean their act up and get this place in shape!!!
