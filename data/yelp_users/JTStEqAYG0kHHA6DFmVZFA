After deciding PetSmart wasn't the way to go, I came across Hugs N Pups on yelp and based off the reviews decided to schedule an appt for my puppies first grooming. The gentleman I talked to on the phone was extremely nice and answered all my questions without getting annoyed (first time owning my own puppy leads up a million and one nonsensical questions). I was happy when Fawkes and I walked in this morning. Everybody in there was so happy and you can tell yet genuinely love animals and what they do. Fawkes was immediately spoiled with attention and of course hugs while I talked with Tammy about what we should do with her first cut. I left her there feeling great and confident about everything. When I returned to pick her up, my little girl was happily sitting on one of the ladies laps and she looked so stinkin cute!! Tammy did a fabulous job with her hair cut, even with Fawkes being a wiggly pup! And my Fawkes was a great spirits when I got her. I'm definitely going be bringing her back for all her grooming needs!!  I definitely reccomend everyone to try them!!  Liza

I have taken Fawkes in twice now to this establishment and just like the first time, I was incredibly pleased! We had the same warm welcome as the first time and they spoiled Fawkes with attention again (which really made her feel more comfortable being there). She was a happy puppy when we picked her up and her cut looked great again and she smelled so good! Also, since she's still young and quite energetic, she tends to be extremely wiggly all the time and with that being said, I was greatly relieved that didn't result in any nicks or cuts into her skin. They really do take great care with what they do!!  :-)

I love Jimmy Johns and in particular the bread they use for their sandwiches. Unfortunately, the handful of times I went to this specific location, I got what seemed like stale bread. Crunchy and crumbly bread is a sad thing indeed in a sandwich. Hopefully they either start baking the bread like it's supposed to be baked or they need to stop making sandwiches with stake bread.
