Kudos to Susan's Oct 16, '10 Open House - I've been going to Susan for many years. She's a great dematologist and her office and staff are the best. Her Open Houses ...OMG! I won the very best raffle prize today - a $1350 Fraxel Hand Rejuvenation Treatments (3 in all!). Always a lot to see, sales reps to talk to, demos, samples, Susan's informative talks, refreshments/sweets, and ...oh yes! She donated $5000 to "Crossroads, Inc" Charity today. Don't miss her next Open House - a 20% discount if you bring a friend with you. Pre-buying treatments and products just makes sense!

Who doesn't love a baseball game?! Take the group tour at 2pm and get in by 3 to the new beer restaurant and watch batting practice from the patio. Chillax in the Audi lounge, get amazing food at a huge variety of places. Top it off with some tasty desserts while the game finishes out! Always a treat to go!

Been coming here for-e-ver! Staff has changed over the years, baked goods have switched out good and not as good, but with the recent remodel and the lastest baked good selection, I think they have it down. We're regulars on our 25 mile bike ride here, so they know our needs and sometimes even have them ready before we sit down, so check it out, you will LOVE their coffee drinks. Sometimes it gets a bit noisy inside but now that the weather is cooling off, the outside patio is really nice to hang out at. Only recommendation for them is get new inside chairs! The rattan ones have seen better days! ;) LOL!

One of our all time favorite places to meet friends for a drink over happy hour. Bar area fairly small so get there by 5ish to get the best tables. Happy hour lasts ALL NIGHT! Outdoor patio very large. Not sure happy hour applies there though. Great beers on tap, also good wines by the glass on HH. Many items on HH menu, varies from $3, $4, $5, $6. All are good, their strawberry salad a must for starters. Good bar staff, food comes up quick too. Dinners are good too. Nice for lunch too.

HHH! (Happy Hour Heaven!) Lots of different appitizers to choose from, ALL of them great. This is a packed place at night, inside and out. The outdoor patio is great for people and car watching. The calamarie was devine, crab cakes are a meal, oysters were oh oh good. Prices very cheap for the quantity and quality during happy hour. Love this fun hangout with a bunch of friends for drinks and eats. Very Scottsdale!

Do yourself a favor and try for a week...stay forever! Love this place...it's my happy place every morning. Group classes (Zumba, dance, barre, weights, cardio, step, spin, yoga hot or normal, etc) and 5 group rooms are my fav, so many choices anytime of day/night in this incredible facility and the best instructors. Trainers and weight room and boot camps on 1st floor/basketball floor. Rball and Squash! Reformer Pilates room! Lots of workout machines on 2nd floor. Staff is awesome everywhere. Spa de da if that is your thing, which it is mine! Extra events like trips, hikes, happy hours, cruises, etc. I bring friends here for a day of working out and relaxing, and most join. It's equivalent to a day at Camelback Spa but better. Food at cafe is better than I can cook! Parties here are a blast - Casino Night, Halloween costume pool party, Holiday Party in Dec, not to mention the pool and tennis courts and tennis parties. View is to die for...walking in or leaving...namaste! Friends made here are friends for life...do yourself a favor...Life is better at the Village! ;)

Try Roka's trendy happy hour! Get there at 4:30 when HH starts, grab a nice sofa or even pre-reserve a HH table, order a $7 Mango Shochu (Honey is ok, a little strong) to get the free Yelp Check-In dessert brownie and settle in. The wait staff is a little slow to take your order, but the amazing food makes up for it. Once you order, food is delivered and empty plates removed very professionally. Munch on Steamed Edamame with Sea Salt $2.5 and Crispy Fried Squid Sweet Corn Tempura $4 while you check out the HH menu. Recommend the following: "Chibi" Burger (3oz) Prime Beef with Wasabi Aioli $3 and Cremini Mushroom Burger with Wasabi Aioli $3, and the yummy Soft Shell Crab Sandwich with Avocado $5. Try a Roka Akor Taco: Scallop and Seafood Ceviche $4 is ok, but definitely get the Pork Belly and House-Made Kimchi Taco for $4 instead. Skip the Crispy Fried Brussels Sprouts - too salty! Opt for the famed Butterfish Tataki with White Asparagus and Yuzu $9, but my fav is the heavenly Hamachi Serrano Chili Roll $10! Drinks and all this food for two with a nice tip well for around $75!!!!  (Shokuyoku!) http://rokaakor.com/mobi/scottsdale-menu.html

Our new favorite happy hour in Hilton Village shopping center. Not a new place, but their house wines by the glass are great quality for the price ($5) and their premiere beers on tap are 32 ounces and only $3. Happy hour menu includes salads, personal size pizzas, etc. Indoor and outdoor and bar seating. A nice place to hit after work or shopping, just don't get there too close to the end of happy hour at 6pm or you'll miss out! Also great for lunch or dinner if you miss happy hour - pizzas and salads to die for. Highly recommend.

Arturo is the owner of of this quiet little restaurant in the middle of a shopping mall right down the street from Costco on Hayden (1 block west of Northsight off Raintree). All his staff/cooks are family. We met Arturo when he was the caterer at a Super Bowl party, and he gave us his card announcing he would be opening up his new restaurant. Others may know him when he was the bartender at Maestro's on Pima.  He is getting a liquor license for the place. Many locals have discovered his gem. This is the way Mexican food should taste. It is authentic, good, and not pricey. Place is not fancy but perfect for this food. We've had them cater one of our parties too. Everyone raved about the food. He knows his stuff. Buenos Nachos with diced bits of carne asada and chunky chorizo is the only thing I order now. Try it and whatever specials they have going on and you'll be hooked too.

Valley Ho Hotel and Spa was built the year before I was born, a true baby boomer hotel! Love their summer specials at the Spa, also Cafe ZuZu for Happy Hour. Summer Spa Specials this year were on Tuesdays, add ons included a Chardonnay Scrub with a glass of Wine! Fun with a group of girls, come early, hang on a float in the cool pool in the morning and get great poolside service with drinks and munchies/lunch. Book massages + add ons for after lunch, then hang out in the ladies lounge with the wine and chill. Cafe ZuZu opens up for an awesome Happy Hour by 4pm - drinks $3, appies $5. Gets pretty crowded by 5ish. And this is in the summer! By Sept when it cools down a bit, the place gets more crowded. Click www.hotelvalleyho.com and look for the party schedule and spa specials. Don't forget SPA WEEK in October $50 1 hr specials! Woo-whooo!

Genius Bar always teaches me something I don't know about my itouch. My battery life wasn't lasting at all - somehow I had turned on my bluetooth, also had at least 100 apps running at the same time, and he got my hotmail working - fast, good, friendly. Amazing. Never had a unamazing time here - just book at appointment on line and they'll never be more than 5 min late. Love this store...;)

A nice place to grab a coffee and a treat and do geeking on the internet. A great drive-thru option if you can't stay. Megan, the manager, has staffed enough folks behind the counter now to wait on the drive-thru and walkins. They even bring you your order if they can! Also they have a foursquare Mayor contest. Large place indoors and out, cool artwork on the walls, free wi-fi (ask for the password slip when you order) and good background music!

You definitely need to try this experience to see what it's like. Remember the movie "Altered States"? Well, it's a much nicer cooler pod and surroundings, and no I didn't have any altered states. I did have a very relaxing total quiet float. You can read the other Yelp reviews to get an idea how it starts from the moment you walk in the door; they are all very accurate. All very professional and "yoga-studio-like", as opposed to the "spa-like" environment I was kind of hoping for. I didn't feel weird about being naked, the keypad lock on the door makes you feel totally safe to have you and your belongings safe in the room. The first ten minutes the music plays ever so softly and a faint crack of light appears when you close the pod. After the music fads, the room and pod go totally dark (no soft blue backlighting in the room) which is a little weird. The earplugs they leave out for you, you need to mold/squish in your ear to keep the salt water out. So you feel nothing, see nothing, hear nothing (except your breathing in and out which is actually quite loud!). I was able to relax in Yoga Corpse pose and occasionally a toe or finger would float to the side. I moved a bit a few times. I felt like a rotated a bit in the pod too. I was not able to fall asleep which was fine. The hour went fairly fast. I don't remember many thoughts in my head. I enjoyed the quiet. When the music comes back on, it's very faint, but they tell you to get out soon, as the filtration system does start up after 5 min of music. Yes, you do want to get out before that happens. I felt good when I got out (albeit a little slimey from the salt water) but the shower and liquid soaps took care of that. The oxygen room wasn't up and running (they have ordered more tubing) but everything else was fine. I actually slept like a baby that night, my sore back from over-twisting in a mean Power Yoga class felt like new again.  I'd like to also ask them about how regularily they change the water, how long the filtration system runs, and how they make sure they sanitize it in-between people. Is the filtration system all they do or do they check on each pod hourly and check/add chemicals or stuff. I might try this again if the price is discounted, as $79 a float is too steep. My Groupon at $39 was a good price point. My only reason I gave True Rest Float a 4/5 stars was the expectation of a "spa" as opposed to an austere yoga studio. Attention to a little more pampering would be nice and a notch up in quality of surroundings would get them a 5! (oh one last thing, turn your cell phone off, mine was set on vibrate and I heard it very faintly buzzing once - very faintly!)

Don't book group meetings here!!!!! This place is usually good and not badly priced, but tonight was just shameful for our group meeting. I should have sent back my $4 worth of a side salad (bag salad with no toppings except some onion strands, not the dinner entree chopped salad I ordered!!!) and at least got a few ribs and coke slaw (1/2 rack it was not!).  Green chili came in an au jus size bowl! I don't usually complain as I've done more group event planning than most, but this one bites. Try their happy hour and their big burger for $8. At least it USE to be good. I hope someone approaches the restaurant on this one. The club members got taken big time, especially those that didn't prepay $20 and paid $25/person. Dessert at least made my stomach stop growling but it was an ice cream sandwich the size of an Oreo cookie? Pa-lease....

Mountainside is in the middle of a hugh renovation so a month from now it will be totally updated. Love the group classes here, love the instructors, love the trainers. Reasonable monthly rates. Only issue right now is Monday's seem to be hard to get a machine (tread, elliptical, etc). Would be nice to have more than 6 of the cool ellipticals too. Yoga and spin rooms are small, but they are adding a boxing ring and hanging workout area. Stay tuned in a month for my final review!

Not my favorite gym right now. Been members for years. They did a renovation a couple years ago (which they assessed us all a fee to help pay for), but now the gym is in sad shape again. So we all got assessed another enhancement fee.  Carpet in locker rooms need replacing, tile/grout needs to be steam cleaned, equipment in group classes needs to be sanitized/cleaned and repaired, we always run out of hand weights and big balls in group classes (1/4 the hand weights are missing rubber), wood floors in gym/classrooms need rewaxing, the locker rooms sinks reek of sewer gas (clean them out/liquid plumber?), always running out of clean towels and sanitizing wipes, spin room bikes/floor are a sweaty mess and probably need replacing instead of bandaid fixes, stereo equipment in Zumba Room cuts out in class, need I go on? Staff seems to not be the issue as they can only do so much, fitness trainers are great, and the group instructors are the best, thank god. We wonder if any of the area managers (group classes, versus PT manager, versus General Manager) talk to each other about what the members are griping about!? They are completely revamping all the group workout classes, for "consistency" on times, and have eliminated classes that have had a many-year following. No one took our input or input from instructors, instructors are now being told they will be wearing "uniforms" (spin, zumba, yoga? You gotta be kidding!) We heard they want to be like LifeTime...well guys, changing class schedules around  without member feedback will only piss off people. Classes right now are packed! No room to move around! Please add MORE classes! Update this gym and you'll be closer to the Big Boys. Members are not happy...if we go, we hurt your bottom line, but unfortunately also hurt your instructors and personal trainers bottom line. Keep us happy gym members! Talk to us for our feedback please!!!!

This place is going down the tubes fast. Almost all their best group instructors have left in search of greener pastures...which there are. The women's locker room use to have 4 hair dryers, now we're down to 1. The 4 soap dispensers in the sinks; 3 only have ever worked, now another has been taken apart on the sink. The men's shower heads drip water instead of a spray. My husband usually tries 3-4 elliptical machines till he finds one that has a TV that works, the audio jack works, and it doesn't rock or squeak. We always run out of equipment in the bigger group classes - mats, smaller hand weights, etc. Management doesn't appear to want to put money into keeping the club running like it should. Group instructors are treated  really poor, and because of that, are leaving in droves. Members I have known there for years are quitting. I feel bad that we will be looking soon too, as soon as my personal trainer sessions are up. Final straw for us? The group spin instructors were told that if the class overbooks by one bike, they have to give up their instructor bike and walk around the spin room to teach it! Have you ever heard of a more irresponsible mandate?! Why not fix the 3 bikes that are not operational right now??????!!!!!!!! Why not just get all new bikes instead of putting lipstick on a pig? Disgusting...run don't walk away from this place. Management has NEVER contacted me on any of my Yelp reviews...can you say "We don't give a s**t!"?

Zero stars is what this review on Yelp should be...So what should we all do about Shea Mountainside Fitness spin bikes? This is the second time my clips have come out of the cleats and I've gashed the back on my leg. Bruised, bleeding, and swollen...hope it doesn't get infected. My Prince Charming took the handles and seat post of Bike F, put both posts in the trash can, then wheeled the remains of the bike into the manager's office. Oh the looks he got! I told the manager the bikes aren't worth "fixing" anymore, they are pieces of crap and need to be replaced. Bike O has a stripped screw on the right cleat that hasn't been fixed since they tried to fix it on their Grand Reopening day 2 frickin' weeks ago...sorry that my friend got stuck with that bike....I told them to put the white board back up in the spin room so we can document all the bikes that need things replaced, tightened, fixed. Who cares that Corp doesn't like the board. Big frickin' deal in Grand Opening - the gym gets new paint. New floors. New furniture. New lockers... But what changed equipment-wise????? Same old pieces of $hit bikes. Who spread the rumor that the spin bikes where getting all new parts?! I guess that shut us up for a month or so. We have been members there for years, and we've been promised soooooo many times that things will get fixed. We were even told at the first remodel years ago we were getting all new bikes! Ha! What saps we are...shame on us. The members on the ellipticals and treadmills were all just laughing and shaking their heads for days after the reopening because no one bothered to re-level all the machines! Even though they told the front desk about them, I guess eventually a week or so later they were leveled finally!? Our spin room did get new paint, a disco strobe light (why?) and a raised surface for the instructor but nothing changed for US the members! So has their policy changed about giving the teachers spin bike away if it's the last bike open? I can't wait to spin and watch a person on the instructor's bike who has no beat and can't follow verbal instruction from the instructor walking around. I'm not new to spin - I've logged in more time since 1995 than most people, have taken classes at over a dozen studios, but I have yet to ever have this injury happen to me elsewhere!  And twice!!?? Throw the bikes out! Don't fix them please. They are a hazard and someone will really get hurt! Everything wobbles, is stripped, is loose, is rusty, seats are split...need I go on??? I only bled on the floor and towels and my bike pack...went thru a few bandages and now have a very painful attractive bruise and cut. I have had it with this place...they have lost amazing instructors and members over the last year. It's time to go... Isn't it the final straw when multiple people have said they drive right by this gym and drive all the way down to the Pavilions because they know the bikes and machines all work down there!? Come'on Scottsdale, BUY NEW SPIN BIKES!!!!!!!!!!!

Highly recommend as a great date night! Sign up as a VIP member for free on line. Pre-order GOLD seats as a VIP member.Go on a Tuesday night if it's your first time. Dress nice like you were going out to a nice bar/dinner. Back row or a two-some recommended. Come early to show, have the valet park your car (part of the GOLD cost). Go to Salt Bar and sit at bar - amazing apps (calamari, flatbread pizza, salads) at happy hour and beer $3, think house wine was $5. Nice tinis too!  Buy a glass of whatever to go at the bar, take your pre-assigned seats early enough to get comfy and get a blankie/pillow. Recline back and enjoy free bags of popcorn. We ordered a flatbread pizza that arrived about when the movie started. Runners can only serve/take orders 15 min into the movie then you're on your own. We saw the Figher but The Kings Speech is still showing too! Afterwards if you're still hungry, head to Tanzy for a late night dinner. Very impressed with venue, although ticket prices are $35 for two on Tuesday nights, I think it's totally worth it with the VIP Happy Hour pricing. We ended up being too stuffed for dinner, so the evening cost us $100. TOTALLY was one of the best date nights I can remember!

HAPPY HOUR - We won a FB $100 gift cert for a Tanzy Happy Hour so we were excited to try it out (we loved the Salt Bar in same iPic complex). We came early at 4:30 (after hitting the Apple Store downstairs) and had an amazing Illegalito drink (actually 3!) sitting at the bar. Bartender and all staff really nice. Place starting filling up after 5ish with work crowd. By 6pm all bar seats taken. Fun people, great evening - big hangar doors open, later windows opened out onto Scottsdale Quarter common area. View of McDowell's wonderful - decor is beautiful. From 3-6 they put out a free artisan chef's table spread of olives, flatbread, berries, cheese and salami. So don't get the Mediteranean Appetizer Platter as it's mostly the same stuff (but better cheeses). We also ate Caeser Salads which were really good. Skip the Cream Brulee - the crunchy sprinkles were ok, the brulee just ok too. We'll be back. (book your iPic Gold Class reserved seats for a 6:45 movie, valet park, free popcorn, pillows/blankies, wait staff during previews - life doesn't get much better than this!)

Only went to one game Spring Training (good seats behind home plate in the shade) but I'm a fan. Order your tickets next year early as all the good seats at most games went fast. We did a 1pm game and saw Gonzo waving and chatting with fans as we left. I think this would be a great place to grab a bunch of friends, all buy lawn seats, get there early, and hang out on a blanket on a nice cool afternoon early in Spring Training. I can't imagine what they will use the place for for the rest of the year, but they do have a Balloon Fest booked this weekend and a concert and stuff for the kids. I hope this will really take off and give us East-siders a fun place to come to. Will check out the Zipps Shuttle next time. Eats and drinks are pretty steep in price, so bring plenty of cash/credit. Great music during the game. Thumps up guys! ;)

Unbelievable place for breakfast, lunch, and dinner! You just have to go there...you'll see! Casual hangout for latte/pastries or go for a huge fresh breakfast better than any fancy place you've tried! Carry home lunch or dinner or eat there. Great fun cute gifts for friends - like shopping at Cracker Barrel  but better!!! ;)

Love this cute place! A little small inside at lunchtime but seemed to handle the lunch line ok today. Lunch was under $12 for an amazing chopped salad, iced tea, and a big a$$ choc chip cookie! You order at their counter, get your own drink, and the friendly staff delivers it fairly fast to your table (as well as take away plates and get you drink refills). Food was amazing, prices were very reasonable for the Quarter, and I liked the very cute informal atmosphere. Parking close by is the only issue (parking garage usually) but today I even got a street parking spot. When the weather cools, I think we'll try the patio with the pups for breakfast or lunch! ;)

Way too much food for anyone to finish no matter what you order by server assured us that he's seen little old ladies polish off what we ordered lol! Place was packed when we arrived, but they had plenty of tables and no one ever seemed to wait. Food was delish, I ordered a leeks omelet (and tons of other ingredients), hubby ordered fruity omelet (again tons of stuff) which was also amazing. Came with huge pancakes on the side. Which I promptly took home with half my omelet! Server was nice and attentive and coffee is da bomb (very good brand, name escapes me). Place is loud so be prepared. Cost for what we got was really good I thought. Come with an appetite please or you'll walk out with lots of to-gos!!! ;))

Happy hour 3-7. This place has finally picked up steam and figured it out. Food and service very good. Seems like there is two crowds...happy hour crowd and later night parties crowd. Good tunes. Lots of space in bar and restaurant. Great huge outdoor dog friendly patio but not till it's cooler out. If no parking in front, plenty of parking around back. Good neighbors hangout to meet, eat, drink, party!

Eutopia is an awesome new fitness and dance studio in N Scottsdale just NE of Shea & FLW! Good friend Kristine opened her studio the week of Memorial Day 2015 and renovations are going on this summer to open up the dance floor to twice the space with new flooring!
