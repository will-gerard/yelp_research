Makeup artist was incredibly rude and unprofessional. She gave me the wrong make up color and I didn't realize until I got home.   The check out desk was also unprofessional. Manager was yelling at an employee in front of the customers. I will not be back to this location.

Bought a beautiful necklace & paid for the extended warranty - the chain came kinked & the charm wouldn't slide on it. Came back to have them fix the kinks in the chain & said the extended warranty would not cover. DO NOT FALL FOR EXTENDED WARRANTY PLAN AS THEY WILL NOT UPHOLD THEIR WORD.

Minus being way too pricey for a college student this facility is amazing. I have never had to wait for equipment or towels like the other competitors out there.

Have been in my new home with a new AC unit for 9 months and have had nothing but extreme trouble with the AC unit. Have had people out to visit the home & "fix" the issue for about 1 day & then it goes back to broken.   Today I had to make three phone calls to the customer service department where I was told that a technician would be out to my house TODAY & that the status of my AC unit is an emergency situation. After following up three times, and waiting 6 hours for a technician to call me back, I finally received a phone call from the technician where they told me that the earliest someone can get to me is 6pm tomorrow. This is completely unacceptable as the customer service phone representatives assured me that someone would be out to my house today. I understand that the department is extremely busy  and I know that it is hot outside but I ask that the staff doesn't make false promises to their customers and waste their time.  Do not use this company.

Food is way below average. Tastes like everything came from a packages or was frozen 5 minutes before serving. Bar could also use a serious revamp. Giving two stars because the beer is good.

Great dog park! We bring our German Shepherd here almost every weekend and we've always had a wonderful experience. It's a little hot in the summer, so it would be nice to have some misters, but everything else is incredible here.

The store manager of this place (Robert Schmidt) is really unpleasant. He is extremely disrespectful and rude to his customers. No sense of manors at all. I will not be back to this CVS ever again! Please hire more pleasant managers.

Tried really hard to like this place and have given them 3 chances not to screw up my nails. Visually, they look great but the acrylics pop off after FIVE days. The problem with this is that it costs me $60 to have a full set of nails for less than a week. Additionally, they only let you tip in cash.

Charged me extra to use their washing machine that was broken. Asked for refund so that we aren't paying for services that we aren't using. Employees are acting like customers are crazy and not patient because services are down but they should not be charging for things that aren't being done.

Not sure why it is taking 5 employees and 45 minutes to get my to go order of a salad. No one can seem to find my order. Need some leadership in here.

This location is amazing! This is the only nail salon that I have ever fully trusted :) John does an incredible job at acrylic nails and Jade is excellent at the gel manicures.   The new pedicure menu is also really amazing and they do a wonderful job during the massage portion of it!   They also just got a new fridge at their store :) I love picking up a Sugar Free Red Bull on my way out.

I love staying here! The rooms are incredible. There is a lot of space and the beds are very comfy, not mention the bathroom has a TV built in to the mirror! The check in attendants are extremely helpful and kind. The only suggestion I would make is to add outlets near the bed...

Staff is super friendly & didn't pressure me in to buying things that I didn't want to. Other salons will do anything to get you to upgrade your tanning package or pressure you to buy unreasonably priced lotion. Great knowledgeable front desk employees & beds seem to be super nice and clean. The only thing that I would change is to have them close later on Saturday and Sunday.

Came here for a last minute meal before my appointment over at massage envy next door. AMAZING, quick, quality service. If you love meat, get the Brooklyn Sandwich. Love this place & will absolutely be back.

I honestly feel like my wait time for this place is a sick joke. Ordered a green smoothie & it took me 45 minutes to receive it. I understand and appreciate that you make everything fresh, however, you should warn your customers BEFORE purchase if it's going to take that long. Please be respectful of your customers time or hire more staff. I will definitely not be back.

First question, how can you have so many employees and have a huge store but be so slow? Second, the drive thru line makes it impossible for anyone to park and get out of their parking spot. This Starbucks was poorly designed and I have had better experiences at other stores.

The slowest service I have experienced in my life. Took 20 minutes to get greeted by our server & an additional 20 to get the drinks we ordered. Then it takes 30 minutes after we completed our meal to see our waitress to ask for the check. If you're training staff members cool, just make sure they're ready by the time you put them out on the floor.  I will say that the food is bomb though, hence the two stars ;)
