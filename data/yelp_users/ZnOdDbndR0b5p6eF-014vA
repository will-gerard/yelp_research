I am not a big fan of seafood so it takes a lot to win me over.  I tried several of the dishes at Original Fish Market including the lobster bisque, the halibut, and the pork-chop with coleslaw.  The lobster bisque was bland and cold.  The halibut was decent.  The pork chop was so bitter and dry.  The whole atmosphere of the place seemed standoff-ish and was not friendly.  Furthermore, it took forever just to get our waitress's attention.  When we finally got her to look our way, she was short with us.  It was as if we bothered her.  I would rather go get sushi than spend more money here.

Update.  Went to a different location.  Non-smoking location.  Got pastrami this time instead of the bland sausage.  Added a fried egg to the sandwich as well.  I forgot how huge this thing was.  I could only eat half.  I am now a fan of Primanti's.

I stayed at the Pennsylvanian for about a month in one of the Corporate Apartments.  This place is old.  I believe it used to be a hub for trains and buses.  The outside looks nice but the hallways to the rooms look a little dingy.  There was mildew on the floors of my bathroom and bathtub.  The washer and dryer was old.  There was rust on some of the door hinges.  The dresser, fixtures, coffee table, dining table, and dining chairs looked new and modern.  The carpet for the most part was clean.  The sofa looked old and was not comfortable.  The bedsheets had yellow stains on them.  I did not use the comforter and one of the layers.  The Pennsylvanian has a maid service option with 1 week or 2 week intervals.  I am not sure if they even changed or washed my bedsheets because they all had the same yellow stains?  wtf?  The views from the apartment is nice, but the windows are hard to see through since the window screens are dirty.  The kitchen is ok.  The corporate apartment comes with a fullsized fridge, dishwasher, coffee maker, silverware, platewear, pots and pans.  There is also an iron and ironing board.  There is also a 22 inch? CRT-TV with about 100 cable channels.  I had a router for internet but it was taken away from me 2 weeks into my stay.  The Pennsylvanian claimed Comcast took it away without even telling me.  They did not offer me a chance to pay for it.  The fitness room was nice.  There are treadmills, elliptical machines, pullup bars, and other various machines.  There are even a few sets of dumbells.  I never used the sauna, so I cannot comment on that.  There is a 24 hour concierge that is always helpful and friendly.  There is also an option to sign up for a dry-cleaning service, which is outsourced to another company.  You drop your dirty clothes into a room and pick it up a few days later after it has been cleaned.  This is rather expensive as well.  Everyone who has a dry-cleaning Key has access to this room.  Thieves could come in and steal your clothes.  If I had an option, I would not stay at the Pennsylvanian again.

Being a Korean-BBQ lover and snob..I needed to get my Bulgogi/gal-bi fix when I was in Pittsburgh.  My search led me to Sushi-Kim.  Oh how I wish it led me astray.  This was probably one of the worst tasting Korean Barbecue places I have ever been to.  The beef was not the right color and was basically bland.  The beef short-ribs were tasty but was way too tough.  I felt like I had to chew each piece 100x or I was going to choke and die.    I was not a fan of the food at all and would not recommend it to anyone.

I was staying at the Pennsylvanian in Pittsburgh for a business trip, so it pleased me that there was a place for me to get a haircut in the same building.  Jeanie did a great job on my hair.  She offered me a robe, so that my hair would not devour my clothes.  My stylist took time to cut my hair the way I wanted it and I could not be happier with the end result.  The view from my chair outlooking the window was a sight to behold.  The cleanliness of a salon is high on my list of priorities and Sognatore passed that test.  The price for a men's haircut is $26, so it is rather steep for some.  Sognatore is closed Sunday & Monday.  I would also recommend making a reservation.

The Omni William Penn Hotel definitely has the best hotel employees I have ever encountered.  Everywhere I went, from the maids, lobby clerks, to the bellhops...they all asked me how my stay was.  They were all eager to help and ready to answer any question I had.  Pittsburgh is an old town and thus, the hotel reflected that.  It isn't old such that there are cobwebs and ghosts in the attic but rather colonial old money.  You get a feeling that you are of the Bourgeoisie class staying here.  Men & women in suits and dresses  litter the lobby area.  I cannot comment on the pricing because I was here on my company dime.  I also did not try the food/room service.  Bath & room items were always replenished on need.  Linens were changed.  Free HBO on TVs.  The hotel foyer & lobby area has a starbucks for coffee addicts and an obligatory overpriced gift shop for those wanting to purchase a Steelers Terrible Towel for $11.99.

In contention for "my last meal on earth."  Thomas Keller's "Steak Frites" is in my top 3 favorite meals of all time.  My shortest yelp ever.  There is nothing more to say.

I wasn't sure if Chino Bandido was a bit racist since it translates to Chinese Bandit, but it is so damn delicious I don't really care. The fusion restaurant steals flavors typically found in Americanized Chinese meals and combines them in bowls, burritos, and qusadillas. My favorites are the fiery Pollo Diablo, the savory Jade Red Chicken (similar to General Tso's), and the shiny Emerald Chicken. The jerk fried rice is addicting but its spicy peppers are not friendly on the tongue. I felt like I was robbing the place because of the huge portions at low prices. The meals also came with a snickerdoodle cookie.

On a scale of one to Lord of the Rings, how much hiking did you do today? Upon my research, I found a vast variation of opinions for this trail. This mountain is definitely not "easy" or "relaxing" in any way. There are narrow paths with steep drops that had my inner Gandalf screaming "YOU SHALL NOT PASS!" Still, I pressed onward to my doom (more on this later).   My friends and I took the Cholla Trail on Camelback Mountain and only made it up about 2/3rds of the way to marker 25. It is at this stop where you will be able to see all sides of Middle-Earth-Phoenix. The hike gets significantly more difficult past marker 15, in which you will need to use your hands and have steadier footing. Retaining water is also a priority, whether in a Camelbak or a large hydration bottle. Watch your step as you traverse your descent, even the smallest rock can cause you to roll your ankle (woe is me). Park on Invergordon road and trek (could up to an additional 0.5 miles) to the trail-head on Cholla Ln.

All dogs go to heaven, but first you have to repent at Franktuary.    At first I was an unbeliever.  I mean, how good can you make a haute dog?  I was blind, but now I see.  Just have a little faith!  I tried the classic Texan (chili + cheese + jalapenos) and a gourmet Pittsburgh (coleslaw + smooshed pierogie aka pot-sticker wrapping).  I liked the type of hot-dog buns used.  It didn't collapse or split under pressure.  It must be a sin to make a hot-dog so divine.  I slurped down the heavenly blue (blueberry blackberry raspberry) fruit shake very quickly.

I know what I want my grave to be made out of.  Pamela's Strawberry Hotcakes.  It is to die for.  "Crepe hotcakes stuffed with fresh strawberries, brown sugar, sour cream and topped with whipped cream."  The first bite of that brown sugar + crispy crepe sent sensations into my mouth unbeknown from breakfast foods.  I have had plenty of early morning grub but most of my experiences were average.  It is not hard to scramble a few eggs, fry some bacon, and mash some hashbrowns.     Pamela's Diner is now at the top of my list for breakfast.  Along with the Obama-approved hot cake, I had eggs, sausage and toast.  My friend's waffle, omelet, and potatoes were good as well.  This Pamela's location is cash only and parking can be hard to find in this district.  The atmosphere is lively and fun.  The waitress to customer ratio is high.  The wait can be long during peak hours.

The Terrace Room is located in the lobby of the Omni William Penn Hotel.  It is "An award-winning restaurant serving "New Traditional" cuisine with original and creative dishes inspired by Executive Chef Jacky Francois. "  This is a very upscale area.  The restaurant itself (being connected to the hotel) is very aristocratic except that there is a huge palm tree in the middle of the room.  There is a full bar and there is an extension of the restaurant into the hotel lobby where you can stalk passerbys.  The service was top notch as expected from a restaurant such as this.  My waiter was always ready to serve and very friendly (although this was at 8pm Wednesday when the weather outside was something like 0 degrees F).  The food presentation was artsy fartsy.  I rather have the food taste good than look good.  But the food tasted great.  The New York Strip I ordered was one of the juiciest I had cut in awhile.  The menu that night was rather limited.  Be prepared to pay a good amount if you want to be full.

This is not Tex-Mex.  Being from Texas, I judge this type of cuisine rather harshly.  Regardless, Moe's Southwest Grill would fall short in the mouths of many yelpers.  I ordered the Joey Combo, which included a Joey chicken burrito, queso & chips, and a drink.  The chicken and rice in the bland burrito was so dry even when combined with salsa.  The queso was a big solid lump of white cheese.  The salsa station was a mess.  When I picked up a to-go salsa container, I did not expect it to be all over my fingers.  You are better off going to Chipotle if you want a better burrito.

Pizzeria Bianco was once described as pizza nirvana, I'm not sure if I agree with this but I did see a blinding white light of happiness. The vision was in a shape of a pie. Thus, I probably had a pizza stroke. The perfect crust coming out of the wood fired oven brought back my sight. Biancoverde and Wiseguy are slices you shouldn't ever refuse. Pizzeria Bianco has a relaxing vibe and a tranquil Italian countryside atmosphere, so mayhaps I was in pizza heaven.
