Great bar by my house.   The food is always good and the waiters do a great job.  They have a glass mexican cup you can buy for margaritas and you get MORE for a lower price if you bring the cup back with you.

I had a deep cleaning done there and have gone to a few other dentist in the valley before finding this one.  I chipped a tooth when I was young and it stayed on for about 10 years.  I broke it off here and after going to a few dentist it fell off about 4 more times in 6 months.  I went to east valley and they fixed a prevous dentist's bad work for free.  I ended up breaking it off 2 more times and they did a veneer for me.  I admittedly had some issue with the temporary but this office was helpful in getting through it and rushed my permanent one.  I had to go in about 5 times to get help but in the end now I have a perfect looking and feeling tooth.  Percilia in the front office is VERY peppy and happy and helpful.  She also is a skilled assistant ( I found out she helped me on a day there was no one in the office on fixing a tooth.)  Good dentist are hard to find and I highly recommend them, they do a good job and care about their patiants.

Doug is the GM there, I had a BAD experience at the Tempe location. I ended up calling corporate since this is not the norm from this brand ( I am new to the area) I found this location to be MUCH better service. I found that Tempe wanted to charge me 240$ to fix a EVAP error and took 3 days of messing with me. THIS location fixed if for 8$gas cap..... HONEST help here.  Jerry and Tyler are service managers that helped me, and my GF that dont know about cars at all.   This location fixed the "leak" code with new gas cap and also fixed my blown out tire and did alignment for much cheaper and better than anyone else I have called.  This one is best in the vally

One of the best local brews I have been to.  Love the food (surprisingly good for a "mirco brew").  Only one better is Stone brewery in Cali.  The food and service are all top notch.  Its cool they have the bar mixed in with the vats they make beer in, to remind you where it comes from.  Right next to college area so its always packed and parking is a pain.  O ya, the beer is amazing as well :)

Sent it if for light on for evap light on- figured it out at autozone before going in. They quoted me at 44$ diag, then would wave that for the smoke test and then a possible hose replacement. 2 days of calling they finally told me it would be 200$ (totallying 240 proir to even finding the problem) more to fix cause they need to drop they tank of since they cant find the issue. I took it to my mechanic near me and fixed it for 8$ (did need a hose by the take replaced) in a few hours.     There is a Mindy Robbins that works there now that laughed and smirked when I was asking about my bill!   I had to take to a manager just to get some help, A lady named Rose finally helped me. Pepboy is a good store, this one is NOT the norm as you can see from the many review I WISH i read before dropping my car off.....  I would like to add I just moved from Kansas city and liked pep boys before and have had a few things done at the Scottsdale location no issues. I will take my car there in the future.  This place puts the pepboys name to shame, sadly. I like/liked pepboys. Corprate should really take a look at WHY - this store has such BAD reviews and all the stores in the area are great.... think about it!

It is a low lit dive bar.  While we went the service was not great.  The biggest one that was temping to walk out was a cockroach went across the floor while we were eating.  There was alot of sports on which was nice and I assume its nice to watch football at but overall not impressed.

5 star steaks/service/wine.  The wine is bit over priced but the steak is fair for the quality.  I have eaten there many times over the years and when on business in Canada got same service and food.  Never let down.  My favorite is the teriyaki steak Chicago style, medium.

Came out to my house and installed CAT5 cable in a residential home.  No one else would come out for under 1000$ (my total was 300).  He came out and fished 6 lines and fixed a wall after having to cut it due to blockage.    Long story short he did a fast professional job.   He also cleaned up after and was courteous .

Love it, its a great trendy sushi bar.  The food was excellent and had live music and was very clean.  The waitresses have always been great and for a sushi bar and the price of the food and sake it was really pretty great.

service is hit or miss but overall good bar, I went for world series game and they would not put the sound on.  They are not a true "sports bar" but the food and beer are good.

This shop owner and master technician both care about cars and their clients.  I am VERY picky about my M3 convertible and dont let many people touch it.  They installed a custom euro style lip for me and repainted my bumper.  My car is a rare color and is a bit older now 03 M3 convertible.  This made matching the color take a few days longer than I wanted but they also knew I wanted this to be done perfect and this car is my baby.   They put the extra time into matching the color since the 5 pre sprays were not to their liking.  They also smoked my blinkers and did some extra fabrication to the lip.  They did charge me extra for this but after seeing it I am sure they put hours into this job and I feel it is worth it.  They are both nice guys and will explain things and not try to rip you off.     I have a E36 M3 that also has full body kit that needs work that I will also take there when I get the money saved up.

The toro roll and "dirty rockstar" were amazing.  The server almost checked in too much.  The drinks were reasonably priced.  This location is a clone of the Peoria and phoenix locations and is just as good level of service and food.  I will be coming back for sure.
