Bad service and food tonight from the swing shift crew! Sad, but this will be my first negative review on Yelp.  Waffle House #1208 (480) 833-0005 1831 SOUTH COUNTRY CLUB MESA, AZ 85210  My wife and I are regular customers at this Waffle House on Country Club Dr.  On Wednesday night, we brought our whole family to eat. The location was not busy. There were 2 other customers in the restaurant & 3 crew members working - 2 servers and a cook.   The food took twice as long to arrive as usual.  The waffles were burnt, there were eggshells in the eggs, the toast was cold, and food items were forgotten.  When we received the bill, the amount was $15 more than usual, yet we had not ordered anything different from previous visits.  We observed that possibly this was because they had itemized every single food item instead of grouping into meal specials as regularly advertised on the permanent menus.  I had to leave early with a few of our children.  My wife stayed behind to pay for the bill.  After my wife requested they re-calculate the ticket, the servers were surprisingly rude.  They said that their manager told them that they were not allowed to combine items into the meal deals and they refused to accomodate our request.  My wife was more upset about their poor attitude in their reaction rather than the actual initial concern of being overcharged.    The staff's unprofessional and rude interaction (combined with the longer-than-normal wait times and poor quality food) was the main reason why my wife was so upset when she left the restaurant.   This is by no means the average experience that we have had as regular customers.  We understand that employees are human and can have bad days too.  But feedback is essential for companies and management to see experiences from a customer's viewpoint and identify areas of potential improvement.

The food and service is always excellent at this Applebee's!  My favorite is the Bourbon Steak & Shrimp.  Also try their signature Mudslides - top notch.

With over 18 years experience in the industry, Rick is the natural choice for any tint job.  He is friendly and approachable and his prices are very competitive.  I recommend Cactus Window Tint for anyone looking for reliable & professional tint services.
