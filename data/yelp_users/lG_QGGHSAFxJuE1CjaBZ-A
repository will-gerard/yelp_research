5 Stars to the staff behind the bar.  Unfortunately everything else is 1 star.  This Zipps used to be a great hangout and I enjoyed it regularly, but now I only make an occasional visit to see a couple of friends. The last two times I have ordered food to go I should have checked before leaving. The zipparitas are loaded with so much Sun Orchard Margarita Mix that heartburn is almost immediately triggered.
