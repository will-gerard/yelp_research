I ate at Udupi on a Friday night when other vegan restaurants in the area were much too crowded. There was immediate seating here with room to spare in the meticulously clean dining room.  I've heard a lot about Udupi's buffet, but I was here well after buffet hours, so I ordered an appetizer and an entree: vegetable samosas with aloo gobi.  One plus is that #vegan menu items are clearly marked with an asterisk, making ordering quick and easy. However, even some vegan items are served with yogurt on the side, so be sure to avoid that. It was no problem for me, as the chutney and tamarind sauce served with the samosas were tasty when paired with the curry as well.  The samosas were served quickly after ordering and were pretty good. I wouldn't say they were amazing, but I would order them again.  The aloo gobi was fantastic. The cauliflower was perfectly tender and not over-cooked as is easy to do. The ratio of vegetables to curry was great--more than enough substance in this vegan entree for my stomach. My only regret is ordering it with a medium spice. Mild probably would have been perfect.  Service was quick, friendly, and attentive without being invasive. Even the restrooms were surprisingly well-maintained.  I would recommend Udupi to anyone looking for a clean dining experience and a craving for Indian food. Their vegan offerings are numerous and I can't wait to try the lunch buffet.

I love Dutch Bros! My favorite drink is the soy Kicker. It's delicious hot or iced.

The juice is good, but don't waste your time coming here. Even with 4 employees working and no other patrons in the restaurant, it takes forever to get your drink. Although the atmosphere is new and trendy, after waiting 10 minutes for a single drink I slowly began to realize it's actually kind of dirty inside, with litter scattered around the floor and the garbage bins overflowing. Will just go to Whole Foods next time, which is literally a few units down in the same shopping center.
