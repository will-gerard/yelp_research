Did not live up to the hype.  We went looking for those "intelligent" dog toys... you know, the puzzle type deals where they have to figure it out to get the treats. They listed about a dozen of them on their website.  The girl at the front looked like she was about to leap the counter and chase me down, because we headed into the warehouse and I didn't hear her go "Ma'am? Ma'am?!"  the first time. (GRAH, don't call me "ma'am", I'm only 21, dammit!)    When I did hear her and turn around, she told me I had to leave my purse up front, which REALLY, REALLY ticked me off. I carry a very expensive bag and it usually has a very expensive phone and wallet full of cash in it. I do not let it out of my sight, ever. Ask any girl - being asked to leave your purse with someone just makes us uncomfortable.   Aside to the owner/managers: Dear Ryan's, I'm sorry you have been stolen from, but that's a hard fact of retail business. Maybe 1 in 500 people will steal and it's not as big a deal as you're making it out to be, ya cheapskates. You can absorb a $3 toy here and there. It's really insulting to be treated as untrustworthy and a criminal when you haven't done anything.  (The purse bit set the tone for the whole trip).   The place was very dim (I know it's a warehouse, but it shouldn't be a 2/5 on the light intensity scale).  The prices were maybe $1.50 below retail stores at the most. It really wasn't worth the drive for us to save that... If you live 10 minutes away, sure.   There were a ton of business-dressed shoppers who seemed miffed at my dog being with us (ew, dog hair in the air!), and at one point we were down an aisle and turned to see about 5 shoppers and employees all standing at the entrance, staring at us. I felt like I was in Children of the Corn, when the girl turns to see all the kids murderously watching her.... It was super creepy.  80% of the stock was stuffed toys and dog clothing. My dog's mouthiness and chewing power would make a great white shark jealous, and he needs tough toys... A stuffed skunk ain't gonna cut it. I saw nothing truly suitable, unless we somehow missed it (and we walked through twice).  To top it off, they only carried 3 of the puzzle type toys, when they showed a dozen on their website. Nothing like driving to central Phoenix from Scottsdale and not having what you came for. Again, we looked everywhere in the warehouse and didn't see any more.  We left with the "Dog Tornado" (which is quite fun) and a knotted rope that looked pretty tough, but my dog has had it for about 30 minutes and has chewed halfway through the knot in the middle... Le sigh.

Minus the douchebags that sat behind us and nearly started a bar fight (seriously, who argues with a guy when he says "Sorry bro, this is my girlfriend" and she's wearing a diamond ring?) , we had a great time.  We went on wet t-shirt Wednesday, but they have cheap drinks all the time, Fridays are dollar wells and domestics.  Place is really big, nice big outdoor patio, but it is insanely loud out there from the echo off the roof, so you will not escape the noise anywhere.  The dance floor is a little small, but I hear that if you get there earlier (around 8 I think), you can actually 2-step. It's very difficult to do any later in the night.  They were playing off and on country music vs. hip hop club music... about 6 songs of one, then they'd switch. Interesting layout for the music, but it worked.  The "fishing" game is the most hilarious, ridiculous thing I have ever sat through. Push your friends out and laugh at their expense; you'll be laughing 'til you have to pee at all the awkward hilarity ensuing.

Came in here the other day looking for a mens dress shirt. We were wandering through the mens area, looking for the formal dress area, when my other half made eye contact with a younger sales girl. He was about to ask her for help, but she headed him off with "Are you looking for the clearance section?"     Apparently we weren't dressed nicely enough for her tastes. I decided against making a "Pretty Woman"-esque scene with my credit cards, and we took our business to Macy's.

I will admit, I made fun of the boyfriend when he wanted to go to 5 & Diner for dinner last night. I made even more fun of him when he showed me $80 worth of vouchers he'd bought on Amazon Local. Who goes to the 5 & Diner? Apparently he does.   So we went to the 5 & Diner. And it was really good.  Pickle chips! A whole star just for having these! They were delicious.  I had the "Diner Dip"; the meat was nothing special but the bun was soft (I can't count how many places give me a hard-as-a-rock bun on French dips) and the horseradish sour cream was yummy. Boyfriend had some kind of burger, and it was one hell of a burger for under $10; this thing was literally 6 inches tall and densely packed with meat, jalapenos, cheese, and onion rings between Texas toast. He lapsed into a happy food coma quite quickly. French fries were perfectly cooked and tasted fresh.   The shakes... oh, the shakes. We had the Reeses Peanut Butter Cup as a malt. It was amazing. Chunks of peanut butter cups at the bottom even!  I loved that they had about 20 flavors, ranging from butterscotch to raspberry to chocolate cherry, and all could be done as malts, soda floats, or just regular shakes. So many options!  Everything came out super fast; 5 minutes on the pickle chips and another 5 for our sandwiches. I was astounded to find it had come out like lightning without being held under lamps; they literally cook that quickly.   Oh, and now I have to rave about our server: She was the sweetest girl I've ever seen in food service. She was genuinely so nice, not the fake front most servers (including myself) put on, that I was incredibly impressed. She had to take my iPhone to do our voucher and it was crazy to see how carefully she handled it and presented it back to me. I enjoyed her pleasant demeanor so much that I left 40% for tip (and even perfect service will rarely warrant more than a 20% tip from me, because most of them have the aforementioned sickeningly sweet fake front). I didn't catch her name, but she had black hair and a nose stud, and worked on Tuesday night, so management please give kudos to her :)

We chose Zinc Bistro for Restaurant Week last month - lucky pick!  I was expecting a lot of snobbery, but the waitress was very polite, not condescending at all, and helpful. She brought me wine samples without me asking, which I've never had happen before.  We had the foie gras ravioli and one of the salads for starters; both were fantastic. Our entrees were the salmon and filet. Oh my God, they were both AMAZING. I could eat them both every day. The filet was melt in your mouth tender, and my salmon was bright pink and hot all the way through. I've never had such great salmon. The vegetables served with were delicious as well.  For dessert, the beignets (with blackberry and caramel sauce) and chocolate souffle were both divine. I mean, I am a chocoholic and I was scamming beignets off the boyfriend left and right, they were SO DARN GOOD with the sauces.   It was pretty pricey even with the restaurant week menu, but then we also had wine and cappucinos (the cappucino was even executed perfectly! Gah!)  Now, excuse me while I go dream about Zinc...

If i could give negative 5 stars, I would.  Here's what I experienced in a year and a half with this "bank":  - They dinged my credit score when I opened my account, not once, but twice. How, you ask? The initial "credit union" check, and then I declined to apply for their credit card, yet a week later got a "pre-approval" in the mail, which I ignored, and when I checked my credit there was an inquiry for "applying for the card". What?!  - On attempting to cash in some savings bonds, the teller took 20 minutes (!!!) and nearly deposited it in the wrong account. It was lucky she tried to address me as "Stephanie" or else somebody else would have gotten my money. How exactly do you screw that up when you have both my debit card and drivers license there?  Stone-age technology: - Their website is ALWAYS down. My God. At least 3x a week. - Their email does not work. I tried to close my accounts (and I refuse to do it in person or online, because I don't want to listen to their spiel to get me to keep it open) and the email bounced back. Professional, eh? - You can't do ANYTHING over the phone, so when the website is down, either drive to a branch or you're screwed. I was in Vegas, away from a computer, and had to call and give my login info to a friend to transfer money to my checking account. This is ridiculous.  And the piece de resistance, the re-arranging of transactions. I log in one day, expecting to have one NSF fee from an emergency purchase, and see my account is negative nearly $300. WHAT?   These bastards had 1) hit me with an NSF fee when I was $61 positive, then 2) re-arranged several days worth of transactions so the largest hit first, causing another NSF fee (which only happened because of the missing $35 from their first false NSF fee!), and then the whole thing just cascaded into oblivion.   I am so beyond pissed at Desert Schools. I refuse to deal with them anymore. These s***heads can keep calling/mailing every day, turn me into collections, whatever, but I just walked away and am not paying for any of their bullshit charges.  I switched over to Wells Fargo (who does NOT rearrange transactions, and all pending transactions show up immediately online) and am much happier.

Awful service, awful food.  Was here several weeks ago as part of a large group; I arrived partway through the meal and did not order anything, so can't speak for the food on that occasion (though it looked good), but the service was excellent. We had a male waiter who handled our giant group with ease and was very pleasant.  This time, we had a girl serving us. I did not catch her name, but she was short, kinda squat and had darker hair. She seemed to have a bit of an attitude, and was nowhere to be found when we needed refills, dressing, or the check. Another server also delivered all our beer from the bar, so she must have really been pulling a vanishing act.  As for the food... We had chicken alfredo and a pizza. The alfredo sauce was ridiculously salty and the noodles undercooked. The pizza was lukewarm when it arrived. The crust was insanely chewy to the point of making your jaw hurt. The only good thing about the meal was the ranch dressing.

Never again!  This is long overdue, but I had a fabulous experience at Fletchers today and was reminded of the antithesis that is Big O on Rural Road.  I went in here in May for an oil change, since it was 2 blocks from my apartment and advertised student discounts.   First, they don't even DO the discount unless you're getting $100 worth of work, and it's a shitty 15% I believe. I'm used to 20% and up.  Then, it took them an HOUR to do my oil. A freaking HOUR and one other car there.   The guy then informs me that my rear brake rotors are "paper thin" and cautions me that if I drive to work in Ahwatukee on the I-10, that they will surely fail and cause a serious accident. Huge use of scare tactics, so I ignored him, but he was just ADAMANT that they were very dangerous to drive on. He then quoted me $350 to fix them - a mechanic friend not an hour later told me it was about $50 for those parts. Ripoff! Side note: This was May, this is October and 10k miles later, and NOTHING HAS HAPPENED. Uh huh, bad rotors, whatever.  The last straw though, was when I was paying and asked about the student discount. The counter is high and I had my wallet open on it, not thinking much of it. At the time I was a waitress and in between bank runs carried a lot of cash. The guy tells me the aforementioned policy, stands on his freaking tiptoes to look into my wallet, and say "Look at all that cash, you don't need a discount anyway!"  That irked me beyond all belief, because I worked my butt off being society's ***** at a high-end restaurant, and the nerve of him to imply I could afford to be ripped off was disgusting.  Go to Fletchers in Ahwatukee for any work, and ANYWHERE ELSE for oil changes. Seriously, this place sucks.

Yes, the best pie within 30 miles of Anthem (at least). I don't even need to review it, everyone else has gotten to it.  I took my parents here for Easter breakfast and the food was great. I don't drink black coffee normally, but theirs was freaking delicious, and my buddy who used to work there told me people order the beans all the time. Random, wasn't expecting the coffee to be such a big hit!  The atmosphere is cute and kitschy. My dad entertained himself in the adjacent bar/dance floor area, reading the legend of the taxidermied bear and looking at the decor. The tourist junk in the main area is actually pretty *good* tourist junk (and tourist traps have been the bane of my existence since age 6). They also have a really nice grassy area with a gazebo outside that was beautiul in April.  Everyone working was super friendly, but Black Canyon City is just one of those small towns that's very homegrown and "Hiya y'all!"  Minus 1 star just because the pies are expensive. $18 for a whole pie? It's good, but that's just milking it.

Dis-gus-ting.  Their new location is more crowded, cramped and hot than the last one. It's just as dark as well. That pet store smell just knocks you over when you come in - a little is okay and part of the pet store charm, but this literally choked my nostrils.  They have way too many fish in way too small of tanks, the reptiles just make me sad (I believe I saw a 5 foot boa constrictor in probably a 20 gallon tank... not adequate) and are a poor selection to boot. All the merchandise is jumbled together and you have to flip it this way and that way to find the prices.   Employees never greeted us or asked if they could help us find anything.   Just a really unpleasant 10 minutes of my life that I will never get back.

Soooo, I used to work here. I am the blonde waitress referenced in Callie's review.   I will not lie - the Roadrunner was a disgusting s***hole when I worked there 2 years ago. It was known for being a disgusting s***hole all through my childhood - nobody ever ventured in save the bikers.   The new owners have really turned it around though. Families are totally welcome - there are babies, teenagers, college kids, adults, and grizzled old-timers. We had a blast taking my 1 year old godson to watch the bull riding on Saturday nights. They even have a stage now, and live bands that are actually pretty talented, and there's room to dance. It's no longer just a sit-on-your-bee-hind-and-drink bar, there's entertainment of some kind.  The food is really good too - the french dip is amazing and so is the Roadrunner Burger. Last time we went for lunch, our waitress was really nice and attentive (a far cry from the staff when I was employed).   Kudos to the new owners!

I was very impressed by this place, for a little spot in a shopping center!  I'm pretty sure it was the owner who seated us himself and checked back multiple times. I think it was an actual cook who came out and checked that our salads were good. The female server who brought our drinks and food was very sweet, answered questions and joked around.   We ordered the seafood mare' and a chicken dish (I forget the name even though I get it everywhere; it was a chicken breast in white wine sauce with capers). Both were very good, though my sauce was kind of odd; it was thick and a little starchy; I'm used to a clear, thinner, more lemony/winey sauce if that makes sense. This may just be how Alessia's does it, to each their own :)    I only have 2 minor negative comments:  1) The initial waiter we were given - the owner had grabbed him as he went past and told him to wait on us, and he made it obvious he was not pleased. I got the impression he was about to be cut and sent home except for our sitting down. We saw very little of him, since they have a 'team' system, so he wasn't an issue  2) Their iced tea is not plain iced tea; it was a sweet fruity variety. We thought it was a mistake until we were brought a refill of the same kind. Unless the initial waiter screwed up the message, I don't know. We didn't want to be THAT table complaining about iced tea, since the nice server was busy with a large party.

I've been here for about 6 weeks now, and it's been a good experience (so far, let's hope I don't jinx it).  Erinn is fantastic. She was super nice doing the tour and unphased by the gazillion questions. When I went to lease, there was an issue with a rent special on Craigslist that they could no longer honor, so she made up for it by sending a postcard to waive my pet deposits. The approval process was done in less than a day, even with my former complex not wanting to release me from that lease. We were in a huge hurry during the move-in, had 2 large hyper dogs with us, and she got the walkthrough and paperwork done in 20 minutes flat, and never batted an eye at the 100 lbs of dog tearing in circles through the place.  The rest of the staff has been very pleasant. I had some issues with construction noise early in the am, and they happily gave me the # to the supervisor. Later that day, they asked if I ever got hold of the guy, and then they replaced my porch light bulb even though that isn't their responsibility. They've even got dog biscuits if you bring your pups for a visit.  The apt is very nice for the price. Brand new carpet and they even painted an accent wall in the living room. Love the balcony with glass doors from both living room and master bedroom.   I have only a few minor complaints:  1) I had no hot water for the first 4 days; the first maintenance guy couldn't fix it, but the 2nd guy got it done and was very apologetic that the first couldn't do it. It probably would have been less time had it not been a weekend. Still, should have checked that this functioned first.    2) There are never any bags for dog "presents". Some days, I will check all 4 dog runs and then 2-3 other dispensers on the property, and all will be empty. I've had to start bringing my own bags on walks.  3) Gina is correct about the neighbors. My immediate neighbors are families and have been pleasant. However, the rest of my "strip" have been rather rude, and I'm very glad they rarely come outside.

Everyone here has been great, this is one of the best businesses I've ever worked with.  My Mustang was smashed into by an SUV and $11k in damage was done to it. The offender's insurance company has been a huge headache, trying to weasel out of paying for anything they can. Everyone at Impact has been going out of their way and trying to help me as much as possible. They really have your back!  Above & beyond points include: - When I dropped it off on a Friday, the front desk girl made a point to call Sketchy Insurance Co and tell them it was now considered non-driveable, so they wouldn't try to get out of paying for a rental for that weekend + shortened Thanksgiving week.  - When I wanted to see the final estimate, the owner himself spent 15 minutes showing me my poor torn-down car and explaining every piece of the estimate.  - JJ calls frequently to tell me the status, and was even calling daily when he was arguing with Sketchy Insurance Co. I knew everything that was happening, total transparency. He made sure I got Ford parts, instead of the after-market crap the adjuster wanted. I've been having a lot of issues with them concerning the rental vehicle, and he's called them himself a few times to try to get them to extend it.   If you get in a wreck, this is the place you want taking care of you and your car.

Super cute store!  I am a self-proclaimed crazy cat lady (though living with a boyfriend forces me to keep it under control... darn) and was so excited to stumble upon this store, I almost called my mother in excitement. They have music boxes, knick-knacks, tree ornaments, signs, coffee mugs, anything you could want with cats on it. They have a small selection of dog stuff as well.  The owner made a point to immediately come out from behind the counter to say hello to me and was very genuine about it (I hate phony store clerks!)  Yay!  Alas, they had nothing that looked like my darling Alfie, but admittedly him being yellow instead of a typical orange makes it hard to find things in his likeness. Oh well!

This is the only auto repair place I've ever seen with 5 stars solid, and they totally deserve it.  My boyfriend has a 1969 Pontiac Firebird that hasn't run in several years. After sinking lots of his own time into tinkering with it and $1000 to the awful Meineke down the street, he gave up... until my car's transmission went for good, and he decided to fix the Bird (yeah!) so I could drive it (yes, I am super lucky!)  Whitey's diagnosed it as the carburetor dumping fuel (which is what Meineke charged $500 to replace.. hmmm...). Upon hearing the story of Meineke, Whitey's told him to order the part himself to avoid the markup and they'd put it in for just labor.  Awesome!  We took it home, but it wasn't running quite right still, and then failed emissions. Back to the shop it went.  Whitey's took it back, spent ALL WEEKEND on it doing various minor things. At one point, they called and said "We've done this, this and this, and it's still not quite right, so we're gonna keep it another day."   I was glad they were admitting they actually felt it to be not right and were determined to fix it, versus just handing it back again... but I was dreading the repair bill.  We picked it up Tuesday. The bill? $7. That's right - SEVEN DOLLARS. They only charged him for a spark plug and oil filter. That is amazing to me - I was expecting several hundred dollars for their time.    The car runs beautifully now, and they were extremely pleasant the entire time. I'm taking my alleged defunct car to them for a second opinion next week. I HIGHLY recommend Whitey's!

I was really, really disappointed with this place. I LOVE Thai food, I would eat it every night if I could. I've been trying every Thai joint within 20 miles of my new abode, trying to find something comparable to the authentic Thai I got in Anthem (of all places). Malees was the worst strike-out of them all.  My first clue should have been when the girl asked "How spicy?"  I replied with "3", as every Thai restaurant I've been to does a scale of 1 to 5.  She responded with an awkward silence and then "... So really hot?"   No... no... just no.   We had the appetizer platter, which was 6 different things that all tasted the same, save for the crab rangoons, the crispy pla and the evil jungle princess. The fish candy was blah. The crispy pla, as someone already mentioned in another review, tasted like nothing whatsoever, and the sauce was overly sweet; I thought I'd need an insulin shot after 2 bites. The evil jungle princess is one of my favorite dishes, but this one was just not right. It was like they had dumped chili powder into it. Chili powder does not go in Thai food. Do not want. It did NOT mix in with the curry and just burned the s*** out of my tongue. The rice was also very dry.  The bill for this "Oh let's just get Thai takeout" evening came out to $49. $49 for freaking take-out for 2 people. I was kind of shell-shocked; I had added it up at home and it shouldn't have been that much.... but me not wanting to cause a scene, I just paid it. I don't know if they accidentally did "large" portions, but they looked normal sized to me.  But Jesus Christ, I can pay $25 for two people and get amaaaazing Thai food, so $49 for this lame excuse for Thai was not acceptable. Yes, I realize this is Scottsdale, and I am used to paying more for everything, but this was a whole new level... Especially knowing there is more authentic, less pricey Thai food about 3 miles south of here.

The okay: The food was decent, albeit extremely overpriced. EXTREMELY. $24 for a 2-person portion of chicken, with nothing on the side? Seriously? Ridiculous.   The good:  Our server (bigger guy with long hair) was awesome and very good at dealing with 10 people who needed to eat and be out in 1 hour. He gets 5/5.  The manager I spoke to today was pleasant. Gave me the impression that he is used to handling Snottsdale people with kid gloves.  The reasons we will not return:   I would advise the owner to check out their booking practices, and perhaps do some drug testing on their employees.     1) My friend made a reservation and we were supposed to have the pope room. My boyfriend and I arrived first and were at the bar when a manager (who skeeved me OUT) came up to tell us that they had "accidentally" double booked the room and we were being bumped to a table in the regular dining room. My friend was NOT pleased but we rolled with it.   I then Yelped the place, and discovered multiple other reviews of people being 'double booked' out of the pope room. I think they are intentionally doing this bait-and-switch 'double booking' thing, because by the time you get there and they tell you the mistake, no way are you going to take your entire party of 10+ people and try to find another restaurant at 6pm on a Friday. They can smash as many large parties in as possible that way. Clever, clever.  2) We tried to cash out, and the bartender had disappeared. When he returned, his face was bright red and he was sniffling. Boyfriend and I exchanged one look and simultaneously muttered "Cokehead". This was confirmed when he ran our card for $147 instead of just our 2 drinks. He reversed it, but the charge still went through to the bank.... because we got hit with multiple overdraft fees today, as we had used the card for several other transactions that night. Now we have to argue with Wells Fargo about this. I know, people make mistakes, yada yada, but had this guy not just obviously done a line in the back, he likely would not have made that mistake.

Like they even need another review - they have a solid 5 stars as it is!  Just got back from my first visit to Adobe, and I am beyond impressed. My German Shepherd pup was having some stomach issues over the holidays, so I decided to have him checked out to be on the safe side. I knew he didn't have an obstruction or other emergency issue, but I was concerned about parasites.  The receptionist, Hilary, was super sweet on the phone and in person. She was upfront with what tests she thought would be ordered, and how much it would run me (and it wasn't an arm and a leg; the office call was only $56). I was very happy they'd be able to see me the next morning, but then she called back not 20 minutes later with a cancellation and said to come on in. Even better!   The tech was very good with his 40 pounds of squirming, and loved on him the whole time. I was also happy they let me help hold him - I've been to vets that called in a 2nd tech, like the owners aren't capable of safely holding their own dog. Okay, maybe some aren't, but I am, and I appreciate being able to and not being instructed like a child.  Dr. Newland was AWESOME.  The difference between him and some other vets I've been to? - Other vets: "Oh my God, we need to run $500 worth of expensive tests and start him on multiple medications", general sense of admonishment for not rushing him to their affiliated ER clinic, eagerness to run the bill up, very few questions about anything, etc...  -Dr. Newland:  Super calm and personable. He spent 20 minutes going over everything (his last few days of activity and stomach issues, diet, contact with other dogs, where I take him in public, anything he could think of really), felt his abdomen thoroughly, and said "Honestly, he's a puppy, they eat funny things, and something probably just irritated his stomach. He's plainly feeling pretty good, so just feed him a bland diet, give him this medication to settle his stomach, and bring a stool sample just in case, so you know for sure he's parasite-free".  He also dispensed advice for my dog's general care, as long as we were there, about heartworm prevention and  necessary vaccines, etc. I even got a good education on the different types of parasites and which were even likely in AZ's climate (turns out, not many). I really appreciated that he didn't try to frighten me into expensive diagnostics and possible serious diseases, and that he is so on his game and scientific/logical about things.  I am very impressed and will be making Adobe my regular vet for as long as possible.

I just had to update with another 5 star experience. The reasons?   - My dog DRAGGED me into the clinic. He runs behind the desk and into the back to greet the techs. He wags his tail and presents his butt for scratches to the doctor. I've never had a dog be happy to go to the vet.  - Our trip to Adobe was because my genius dog ate a glass ornament, so I rushed in with no appointment. Dr. Newland was just finishing a surgery and came right out to take care of us within 10 minutes.   - This qualified to me as "emergency", and nobody panicked. They actually teased him instead and now refer to him as "Glass Eater". This made me laugh a little and was much appreciated, as I was having panicky thoughts of $2000 surgery racing through my head, never mind the idea of losing my dog.   - Dr. Newland remembered me and things we had chatted about 2 months ago, as well as thanked me for my Yelp review. Awww, thanks! I love how much they know and remember all their clients here.   They ran an x-ray and turns out my dog wasn't really intending to EAT the glass, but he did chew up and swallow a few tiny shards. Luckily, they were so tiny that they were already passing right through. Again, Dr. Newland gave me some very low-key, common sense advice - feed him bland food and bread, Pepcid so he won't vomit glass back up, no hard playing so he doesn't get any stray shards slammed into his intestine walls... you get the drift. Again, at most other vets I've seen, I'd be leaving with a bunch of unnecessary medications.   I'm just gonna give them a permanent 5 stars, cause I don't see anything changing any time soon :)

Very, very unprofessional.  Went to look at a 2011 Camaro they had priced at $17,800 online. KBB value is around $18,000, with 22 people having paid less, down to $16,200. I had already looked at a 2013 Camaro at another dealership, with 5k less miles, and sticker price at $16990... obviously a better deal, but it was the wrong color and I knew Mark Kia had been sitting on this car for 5 months, so maybe they'd drop the price the $1000 difference.   We'd already gotten the run-around with the car having been listed at the Phoenix dealership, (allegedly someone was going to purchase it, so it was at the Scottsdale dealer... riiiiiiiight) so they probably thought we were an easy sale since we came out to Scottsdale to look at it, and I'm an early 20s girl. Bad assumption on their part.  The salesman was very low pressure; in fact he hardly talked. He admitted to being new at one point (tactic to make us trust him maybe?) Knew nothing about the car, warranty, anything. Back in the office, I refused to let him ding my credit, told him I wanted to talk sticker price and not payments, etc. He came back with some BS about the wholesale car value being $18,000 and retail at $20,900... I pulled KBB on my phone and called his crap... because I know they purchased the car at auction themselves and likely got a smoking deal, especially since they've kept it on the lot for 5 freakin months. They then wanted to tack on $495 in dealer fees plus $1300 in other "reconditioning" fees, bringing the price well above "fair value Blue Book".  After we picked all this apart, and pointed out him conveniently forgetting 8% sales tax, he seemed to give up and turned us over to his finance manager.   Finance manager (Chuck?) was incredibly condescending and seemed to be attempting a beat-down hustle on me; refused to look up the 2013 I alluded to and seemed to not believe it existed... then told me essentially "Tough ****, this car is going to auction later this week so this is the best deal you'll get".  Right, you're gonna send it to auction and lose money on it that way, instead of just dropping the price $1k for me and getting a financing kickback. I'll believe that when pigs fly.   Terrible experience. If you go to them, have your guard well up and bring a calculator and be prepared to do math.

LOUD. Loud, loud, loud.  That's seriously the only thing I can think of when anyone suggests Ra. The music is blasting so loud that you have to yell across the table to your companion - definitely not a pleasant dining experience. - 2 stars.  The girls (yeah, I've NEVER had a male waiter or host here) are pleasant enough but service is a bit slow. - 1 star.  On the other hand, the food is good and really reasonably priced - I recall Happy Hour being around $18 for a couple iced teas, Vegas Rolls, and a few other rolls, having some left to take home even. Otherwise, it was $36 for dinner the last time I went.  So, as a compromise the last time Ra was suggested, I dragged my oh-so-tolerant date to the Ahwatukee location. It was MUCH QUIETER and the service was surprisingly good, despite it being 10 pm on a Saturday with a packed bar. It was worth the 5 miles to Ray and I-10, because the sushi is definitely good.

I've stopped into Hippie Gypsy numerous times since starting school at ASU. It's great for killing time and getting out of the heat, and ogling a lot of colorful, interesting pieces ("pieces" being both smoking paraphernalia and jewelry).  The incense is fantastic, $1 for 10 sticks and about 25 different scents if you buy the "bag your own" bulk. The clothes are eh (maybe just because I do NOT dress anything like your typical stoner hippie, and they mainly have t-shirts and peasant skirts). They've got a lot of wall hangings and signs as well that are always fun to flip through.  The glass art is my big draw. Having my ex be a glass blower at Chameleon Glass, I have a huge appreciation for unique pieces. Hippie Gypsy delivers. Lots of absolutely beautiful pieces, from bongs with tiger striped flames to pipes shaped like animals, and a good selection of Zongs as well. They also have a lot of glass and other types of jewelry as well that are pretty neat.   The staff are super chill, they remembered me after several weeks and have even given me incense on the house - they only take cards if the purchase is over $5 and I spaced on that. I was pretty impressed when the guy told me not to worry about it - that would never happen at any of the big chain smoke shops around here.  4 stars because it is definitely overpriced - I can't justify $50 for a one-hitter (no matter what fabulous local artist it's from) or $30 for a peasant skirt. They cater to the ASU party crowd running around with daddy's credit card, plainly. I would recommend them for incense, jewelry, and trinkets. Overall a fun place though.

The first thing that comes to mind when I think of Fat Tuesday is "dark" and "dirty", each vying for the position of first.   This is the kind of place where underage ASU kids sneak in and a frat boy roofies a girl's drink and catches her alone in the dark, grimy, secluded bathroom area. I'm serious. It's that bad.  This is not comparable to the daiquiri/margarita slush deals in Vegas either.  The overjuiced Pauly D look-a-like bartender would not leave us alone, and kept regaling us with tales of why girlfriends and boyfriends are a waste of time and you should just kick em to the curb in the morning.... Thanks for the advice, broseph, I'll be sure to tell my boyfriend that.  And speaking of the hangovers: You know how I knew I was going to get a hangover? Not because of the alcohol in my drink, but because of the sugar. It was like they dumped 10 lbs of sugar in each machine. And guess when I got that hangover? Not 20 minutes after finishing my drink. Talk about feeling like crap, ingest 300 grams of sugar along with probably 3 shots of rum blended with ice. BLECK.

Like everyone else said... LOVE IT.  I could furnish my whole house with their stuff. It's all southwestern/cowboy themed - they have furniture, wall hangings, dinner services, knick knacks and trinkets, and even some boots and hats. Everything is usually on sale to some degree.  The mustached gentleman that took care of us was very nice and helpful. We purchased a picture frame, a cute hanging piece and a cowboy boot piggy bank for my godson - it all added up to about $20, and unlike some stores in the area, I was glad he treated us like we were still worth his time even though we weren't buying anything big.  Can't wait to come back with my whole week's earnings to splurge on some more decor!

I've tried Coffee Plantation twice.   Both times I ordered a vanilla latte, and both times the espresso was extremely bitter. The first time, it was just bitter coffee taste + milk (no vanilla or sugar flavor whatsoever). The second time, it was bitter coffee taste + vanilla syrup + way too much sugar.  No consistency in recipes apparently, but consistency in the espresso sucking.  The guy last night was reasonably nice. The girl I had the first time was very short, impatient and seemed very unhappy to be there.  Menu is hard to read - sure, handwritten chalkboards are cute, but this one is a jumble and is hung way up and far back.   There is ample seating and it seems like a decent place to hang out. Unfortunately the coffee is so bad I wouldn't bother.

I really don't care for this place, at all, and was dragged here twice by a friend who loved it.  The whole restaurant is large and empty with no decor. It's like an enlarged tin shed.  The menu is confusing.  The girl working talks to you like you're stupid if you don't get or like how the menu works. She couldn't fathom that I just wanted my food plain. "Are you sure? You get it in a taco or a burrito if you want!"  But chica,I DON'T want. I am here against my will and I just want normal Chinese or Jamaican food, not some weird bastard child they had with a Mexican.  The whole concept to me is like what I do when I have random leftovers in my fridge and tortillas; make burritos out of the leftovers. It's not something I would pay for. Maybe that's personal, but I find jerk chicken does not go in a tortilla well.  The food is either bland or so hot you can't taste anything else. The second time, it made me extremely sick in my nether regions for the whole afternoon.   Never again.

This is the biggest dog park I've ever seen, and that equates to one pooped pup after 45 minutes!  (Your mileage may vary, unless your dog also has the mindset of "Omg, dog park! Omg, new friends, chase me, chase me!")  There's a lake, as mentioned by others, with a cute little dock area and even the nice touch of a hose area to rinse your dog off, so he doesn't smell like rancid fish. Lots of retrievers were diving in after balls!  My dog is not a fan of water (okay, let's be blunt, he's kind of a priss who won't even go out in the grass when it's wet) but he sat and watched the others; guess they were having so much fun, he *wished* he was a little more hardcore and could join.  I liked the small/timid area they had, perfect for small dogs who are terrified of getting trampled by the big boys.   My only negative point is that when someone said "Disneyland for dogs", I pictured colorful, agility-style equipment. Nay, it is but a block A-frame and a concrete Z-type shape of bars to go up stairs and walk across. Not as exciting as I thought.   Also, I know everyone doesn't like to include the other owners in reviews, but they contribute to the experience. I had a Dreadlocked Stoner Dude's big-ass dog blindside Nately out of nowhere (on leash, walking to the entrance) and pin him to the fence, snarling. The DSD just said "Hur hur hur, that's funny" and pulled his dog onwards. Uh, apology please?  I also didn't care for the woman who kept commenting loudly about how skinny my pup is - trust me lady, he gets PLENTY to eat, mind your own beeswax. At least he can still get up the steps of the Z-shaped thing...

Yay! I heart Pet Club.  They are the closest place to south Scottsdale for horse tack and supplies (other than Tempe Feed, who I'm not fond of). Half the store is horse stuff: decent selection of bridles and bits, halters and LOTS of grooming supplies, treats, food, supplements, etc. You not only get a diverse selection of things, but also every size imaginable of each product: they carried 5 different sizes of Leather New.  Decisions, decisions for sure!  The rest is dog and cat stuff and holy crap, do they have a huge selection of toys. I stayed far away from those aisles because I knew I'd spend too much with the many choices. There were also a couple aisles devoted solely to high quality dog food (Innova, Blue Buffalo, Castor and Pollux, etc.)  The girl working was really nice and loved on my dog, and even held his wiggly butt for me while I looked at a halter. He got puppy treats on his way out as well :)  We'll be back!  PS: You might miss it if you're not looking for it, especially if coming from the west; the building is kind of unremarkable. It's on the northeast corner of Main and Country Club.

I'm still stewing about the experience I had here last night. Bear with me on the length.... I'm THAT annoyed.  El Encanto has been a hit or miss for many years as far as the food. Boyfriend and I stopped in last month and were pleasantly surprised.... except for the service. Our server, a 30s something woman (whereas the others looked reasonably young), is just one of those people who should not be waiting tables, both from lack of customer skills and memory and just obviously not wanting to be there. We were too tired to get annoyed though.  We took my mom out for her birthday last night to El Encanto, and got the exact same server. Ugh.  Now, I've been waiting tables since I was 16, ranging from fine dining snobbery in Scottsdale to a Dennys to the Roadrunner Saloon where biker fights break out weekly. In NONE of those would her service have been acceptable.  1) Her style is awkward, rude and abrupt - she interrupted us mid-sentence multiple times, kept hovering over the table while we were eating, etc.  When I ordered a margarita, I had to repeat "on the rocks with salt" multiple times... what waitress can't remember a frickin' diet Coke, a margarita and a sangria?... and instead of asking me for my ID, she just stood there and stared at me (I rarely get carded, so it's not a habit to pull it out, and you still need to ASK, lady). I also mentioned it was my mom's birthday and she didn't wish her happy birthday, no candles on the dessert, nothing.  2) We somehow ended up being brought the pitcher of water and one water glass. What? There's three of us here, 2 of whom have alcohol... at least assume 2 glasses. We also had no silverware.  3) She VANISHED. Like, Harry Potter, Invisibility Cloak status vanished. Our drinks were brought by a manager, our food and silverware by a bus boy, the manager checked back on us, etc. We didn't interact with her again (except for her awkward hovering throughout dinner) until she came to whisk plates away and plop the check down....   4) You don't freaking drop the check without asking for dessert - what, are you nuts? Do you not want your check and tip to go up?! That's server 101. "Hey, we want dessert." She brought a menu, not 20 seconds later swooped back to say "Did we see a dessert we want?"  and then I made my fatal mistake: I asked for another minute. This minute turned into literally 10 minutes (we clocked it!)  We finally order it, someone else plunks it down along with our check.  15. Dang. Minutes. After we're finished with our dessert. That's how long we waited, too hopefully, for her to come pick up the check. I was steaming to the point of wanting to dine n dash.   Finally I take it to the hostess stand and tell the manager I need to pay but our waitress has been.... She finishes my sentence with "AWOL?"   Gee, how did you know?  If you know she's been AWOL and is a terrible server, why is she still serving?  The manager merely ran my card, apologized with a robotic "I'm sorry about that", explained to me that one copy of the receipts was mine and the other theirs (who the hell doesn't know that?) and went back to the bar to talk to the bartender. No drink comps, no offer to make it right, nothing.  This is the first time I've ever totally stiffed a waitress, but it was the worst service any of us had ever gotten, and hey, you work for your tip. This is the first time I've ever had an issue in a restaurant and not at least gotten a sincere apology and an attempt to rectify it. To think I paid $67 for 3 people (without tip!) to get treated like we didn't matter, is ridiculous.  We will NOT be back, El Encanto, EVER.

I feel really terrible writing this 2 star review, but that's how I feel.  I brought my Shiba Inu in here because she had a growth on her hip and needed her rabies shot. A friend of mine was a volunteer there at the time (they just hired her as a tech actually) and highly recommended Dr. Cohen.   Dr. Cohen sampled the mass with a needle and said he was going to look at it. It took him two tries, thus two stabs with the needle for my poor dog. They did not let me hold her during this, which I'm sure only added to her anguish, and made me feel guilty as she looked at me like I was giving her to these people to be tortured.  He announced that he had found red and white blood cells. He spent 10 minutes convincing me it was an infection, or an abcess-like thing, which didn't seem plausible - it had no openings or scabbing.  Then, to my shock, he recommended that it would be a waste of money to send it off to a lab for pathology. Excuse me? I know this doesn't LOOK like typical malignant cancer, but it could still well be basal cell carcinoma, which DOES reoccur and I need to know if that's what it is so this one can be removed and I can jump on any later growths instantly. I appreciate trying to save me a lab fee, but come on, lumps that grow are concerning. He was so adamant that it was pointless that I said forget it.  From what I recall, he sent me on my way with a near $200 bill (!!!) for the exam, his needle stabbing/microscope looking, and antibiotics. The rabies shot, the only thing that was useful out of that bill, was $30ish. So much for saving me money.  We did not return, his antibiotics (even with refilling them and doing a second round) did nothing, not surprisingly, and we had the tumor (which actually started growing at an alarming rate and oozing blood) removed at our normal vet. To my self-satisfaction, it was indeed basal cell carcinoma and was also growing inwards into her muscle. Our normal vet was appalled that Dr. Cohen had not wanted to have it removed and tested.   If you do use Anthem Pet, I would do some research of your own on your pet's possible conditions first, and be prepared to override the doctor's ideas.

Hands down, best Thai food ever.   This is authentic stuff. The owners, Peter and Nancy, are direct from Thailand, if you can't tell by their accents, and live in Anthem (so you really are supporting local small businesses!) They've become very close friends of mine. Actually, they're friends with many patrons - I see a lot of customers come in and greet them by name. It's really a cute neighborhood type of thing.  I have a serious addiction to the panang (curry and mint leaves with chicken) - I've been known to drink the sauce out of the to-go container after the meat and veggies are all gone. The Evil Jungle Princess is my second favorite. The sampler or the chicken sate are fabulous appetizers. The fried banana is also super delicious, but I would recommend it as a dessert to be shared - it's amazing how sugary sweet a banana comes out when heated!  I have tried multiple Thai restaurants in my current locale of Tempe, but none have been quite as good, and if we go within 5 miles of Anthem, it becomes "Puh-leeeeease can we go to Dara?!"  There is another Dara Thai in Flagstaff that is also owned by them - I think it's Peter's sister that is running it. It's just as good.   Oh, and for those of you who say you can't find Phuket beer anywhere... Dara has it :)

I really, really like this place. It takes some willpower to not swing by on my way home from school every day.  There is an endless variety of tea, probably 75 or so, and everything I've had has been delicious. The passion fruit and blueberry white are incredibly yummy. They have Sugar in the Raw and agave syrup that go beautifully with them, so you get a light, sweet tea (not a sticky sweet concoction, like the passion fruit at Starbucks).   The sandwiches are really good too, and my friend had a frappe type deal, I think it was peanut butter and chocolate, that was divine.   The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is that it's pretty pricey - $3.88 with tax for basically tea leaves in water.

I was really disappointed with King's unfortunately.  The food was bland for the most part. I had the coconut crusted mahi mahi and boyfriend had the Greek swordfish. His yogurt sauce was the only thing with any flavor to the whole meal. Sure, mine LOOKED like it had coconut and lemon sauce on it, but no taste at all. Garlic potatoes seemed like instant potatoes, zucchini was grilled to the point of tastelessness.  The creme brulee was the only decent part, and it was so "I don't give a fuhhh" in presentation, it was painful - it had one single strawberry on top in a white crock. At least it was enough sugar to alleviate the boredom of the meal.  The service was super slow. It was a Monday night and I think there were maybe 5 tables of people with at least 2 servers. Come on guys, step it up. We waited 10 minutes to order drinks, I sat with an empty glass for another 15 at one point, and the waiter never checked back on us during the meal.   Atmosphere was way, way, way too bright. It was like a diner. This is not what I expect out of $20 a plate for undersized portions of fish. Funny, it doesn't look like this from the outside at all - it looks very romantic from the outside.  I would have preferred Red Lobster.  Edit: Like many of the previous low-star reviewers, a manager contacted me to set things right... I now have $50 towards a second chance for King's. We'll see if they manage to get something right this time.

Much better this time around.  The GM, Kari, sent us gift certificates after my negative review, with an apology. We gave King's a second chance on Saturday night.  This time, we were seated in the bar area, which had a lot more pleasant atmosphere (less diner-y and loud, with a view through the bar window of the Tempe Marketplace fountain). Our server, Nicole, was much more attentive and pleasant than our last server. She even brought bread out before we even ordered - yay!  The food was greatly improved as well - we didn't order the same things, but usually if a place sucks, it sucks all the way around. Boyfriend did the Captain's Platter (fried scallops and fish) and really liked it; fried without the meat being overcooked, still juicy. I did the Seafood Cobb Salad, and it was really excellent - the shrimp were so flavorful and the salad was HUGE. They did not skimp on any of the ingredients. I'd definitely get it again.  The bread pudding was... different. My other half really liked it (it's drowning in Jack Daniels sauce, of course he did) but the texture was strange to me; reminded me of French toast, it was mostly bread in sauce, not really "pudding" to me. It was very good though.  I'm glad to be able to re-write my review positively :)

This is a fun little place in Heritage Square. It's set inside an old house with flower pots and vines hanging from the metalwork on the roof. It's cute. Mostly a hipster atmosphere, with a few people my friend recognized as local politicans and aides - neat for people watching!  I liked the orderly line to get drinks from the front bar, much better than flagging down a bartender. You pretty much have to sit outside, there is very limited seating in the two or three rooms inside and it seemed to be mostly groups that ordered food.  They have a pretty extensive selection of beers. I had an Angry Orchard Cider, which was almost like carbonated wine - yum. Good selection of whiskey and scotch as well.   I was not partial to the singular bathrooms (never a good plan in a popular drinking establishment), especially when a bunch of drunk girls started pounding on it and yelling "What are you doing in there?!"   Um, I'm taking a pee, ladies, calm down. The bathroom was, however,  pretty pleasant inside, they had painted it up nicely in reds and blacks and it was roomy... okay, that sounds weird for a bathroom to be judged for its roominess, but it's nice to have room to stand up and turn around...  I was also not partial to $15 for fish and chips. I mean, sure, it was all you can eat, and it was really delicious, but that's still really pricey for some battered cod and potatoes. Most all you can eat fish and chips is around $10 to $12.   We also could not get a waitress to pay attention to us, I had to order my food from the front bartender (who looked like a deer in headlights when I did).  Overall, we enjoyed the few hours we spent and will return when in downtown Phoenix.

"Hipster" is the exact word to describe Cartel. Everyone else hit the nail on the head. The place is decorated with the most obscure, industrial junk looking items possible (seriously - one of their chairs is the dryer chair from a salon) and they were playing Queens of the Stone Age last time I was in. Place was also packed with snooty holier-than-thou college hipster kids on their Macs.   The coffee is worthy of the 4 stars - I order mochas, and the earthy flavor of the coffee went with the chocolate perfectly. Since they don't post prices (which always makes me suspicious), I'll tell you that a small was $3.75 - pretty reasonable!  The atmosphere is the reason I detract a star - the cashier was friendly enough though seeming rather distracted, as was the guy making my coffee, but the attitudes emanating from the other patrons make me take mine to go. If you're not dressed like one of the sheep, expect them to look daggers at you if you go near a seat.

Alright, alright.    I had to update, just because my friend got me hooked on their iced chai. Holy s***, it is the most freaking fantastic chai I have EVER HAD, and I order that everywhere. GET IT.  I also tried one of their coconut chocolate cookies - not half bad, big flakes of coconut inside dark chocolate cookie.  The two male baristas I've seen have been cheerful and talkative, the girl is the only one who's a litte standoffish.   Also, apparently if you pay with a card, they put an 'authorization' of some kind on - I ran my debit card, as credit, and instead of $3.50 it showed up in my statement as $6.50 for a couple days before correcting. The guy tried to tell me it was "just like what gas stations do, to make sure the money is there', but I have never had that happen anywhere... strange, but it fixed itself... *shrug*.

No, no, no. After reading the below rebuttal to Dave B.'s review, I will never be patronizing Cartel again. If you don't like the review you got for your business, either offer to fix the problem without sarcastic comments, or ignore it, don't respond just to be a jerk and insult the person further. I had a bad experience at the Scottsdale location and decided to only go to Tempe and only for the chai (which they can't be pretentious about), but that's been shot down as well. Jason can kiss my $20/mo in Cartel purchases goodbye.   "Wow  Dave! You are hilarious! If only you actually understood coffee, you might have been able to actually promote better coffee in AZ! You shouldn't be commenting about coffee since you drink it with caramel anyway. You should probably rethink that life decision! As for your bad customer service experience, i deeply apologize for that! They no longer work for us. I would be happy to send you a bag of our coffee in the mail, so you dont have to come in. You just have to promise me you will taste before you add! Email me - jason@cartelcoffeelab (BTW - could you please clean up the profanity?) "

Mom & Pop, hole in the wall, call it what you will, but this place is delicious.  Their sweetened raspberry iced tea is the best I've ever had, perfect when running errands down Mill on a hot day. They brew each glass individually. I used to go here specifically for the tea, and have fond memories of heading off to California armed with a large one in my cup holder ;)   The cookies are definitely the kind my mom used to pull out on a cookie sheet, with a little bit of grease (you know what I mean, like leftover butter almost) on the bottom and fresh. Lots of flavors too.  They're super generous with the portions - you WILL need a spoon to eat the ice cream sandwiches, there is literally a rounded full scoop of ice cream in each.   The owner is usually there, and 9/10 times is so super cheerful you can't help but smile. He also thanks everyone for their business each time.   I finally decided to write a review because he was there today, and not only did he A) come out and chit chat while the girl was making my order, he B) asked twice if I wanted more ice in my tea since it was so hot out, and C) asked me if I was a student and gave me the discount.  Not a big deal to most, but I'm used to having to go "Hey, I'm a student" and be 'carded'. Most places don't WANT to give discounts, but he was more than happy to and didn't make me rummage for my Sun Card either.

Yuck. (And I'm not one of the people comparing it to how it was in the 70s either - I am a 21 year old college student that thinks it is yuck.)  Mill Avenue is not the hype people give it. It is disgusting. It's dirty and grimy (and not just because it's old). There are homeless drug addicts everywhere you turn, that will harrass you if you don't give them change, and scare the crap out of me when I have to walk past. I will NOT walk down Mill after dark alone.   Full of wasted college kids here every weekend night of course, and it is a terrible atmosphere if you're not 21-24 looking to get hammered and lucky.  Good luck finding parking, it's all metered, expensive garages, or free 3 blocks away at Farmer and 5th, but that's usually full of students' cars.  EDIT: No more free parking, ANYWHERE! 5th and Farmer is now "Permit Only" until 6 pm. So if you want to get lunch or hit happy hour, you are SOL on parking. Gee, Mill Avenue, guess you really must not be doing well, that you have to take more and more free parking away every few months.  The stores are all corporate garbage, except for Old Town Books, Hippie Gypsy and a couple independent (at least I think) restaurants/bars. How exactly is a giant PF Changs, Urban Outfitters, and Starbucks conducive to "local flavor"? The rent in the area is outrageous, hence why the mom-and-pops can't stay in business.  And if I didn't hate Mill Avenue enough, the fact that they had a cute mom-and-pop ice cream sandwich store (Cookiez) and then allowed "Slickables", a big honking backed-by-tons-of-money store selling the EXACT SAME PRODUCT with Dreyers ice cream to move in across the street. That was just in poor taste, especially since Cookiez is now out of business.  Take your venture to Old Town Scottsdale instead - way more variety!

We got takeout the other night. It was ready in 15 minutes. That's awesome in itself.   Got 2 samplers, one with the ¼ rack of ribs. The ribs literally fall off the bone. The sauce is great. Brisket was tender and fell apart too. Chicken and pork was delicious and moist. Sides were the "horsey spuds" mashed potatoes, corn on the cob, sweet potato chips and mac and cheese. The mac n cheese even had bacon in it and was definitely not Kraft! Everything was delicious. The only suggestion I'd make is put some sugar or salt on the sweet potato chips, and more horseradish in the potatoes.  I also was delighted that they thought of EVERYTHING; BBQ and corn were in tinfoil so they were still hot when we got home, plenty of BBQ sauce, silverware, napkins, and they even remembered to put in butter for the corn.   We usually do Lucille's but we got 3x as much food here for the same price. Score.  The restaurant inside looked really laid-back, 'country, and like a quiet place to eat.

I was pleasantly surprised, not expecting much from a chain.  The baristas were the standout - yesterday the brunette girl was super sweet, and also wonderfully patient with a group of kids who came in (not sure what for, but they took up 10 minutes with a presentation of some kind). The girl I had today had a beautiful half sleeve tattoo, and she won me over to Coffee Bean permanently - I did the most irksome thing possible and paid for $4.50 with quarters, and not only was she patient and smiling, she even commented that "I love doing that, it doesn't feel like you spent any money now!"  SHE GETS ME, MAN. If anything gets me to be a loyal customer, that's it.  The coffee was great - The hazelnut latte was wonderful, not overpoweringly hazelnut sickly sweet syrupy gross, but a perfect mix of coffee, milk frothed to the right consistency, and hazelnut. The dark chocolate latte was also good, though a little thin - oh well, can't win 'em all.   It's quiet inside, great for studying or working. I love the board they have full of military support and letters thanking them for sending coffee to the troops. They also have a selection of tea that all look wonderful.  Only minus 1 star (wish I could deduct half a star, it's so minor) is the layout - coffee comes out at the far end, not the front like it appears.

Boyfriend decided he needed a hair cut for an important job interview, so we popped in here.   The front desk girl with multi-colored hair was rather unpleasant.... reminded me of an eye-rolling, gum-snapping teenager with her attitude. I would have ignored it, except that she chose to take his info, then look at my hair (which was lavender at the moment, don't ask) and with a disdainful look say "Just one of you?"     ... B****.  They took him right back and I ventured into Tempe Marketplace, but when I returned 45 minutes later, they were STILL working on his hair. It was supposed to be a simple trim of the front "emo style" piece and the "mullet" in the back - that's a LONG time to take for that.  It wasn't a good job either - he ended up with a top layer that looked like a bowl cut, with random vertical pieces taken out. He was not pleased..

This place is HUGE. It's like a small Mexican village, complete with volleyball courts, cornhole, patio areas, dance floors, and a kitchen and multiple bar areas. It was a really cool, laidback vibe going on.  They had buckets of Pacifico for 6/$18; not a bad deal. One of our group had a sandwich of some sort and it was apparently pretty good, 'cause he ate the whole thing. Our server was really chill, cracking jokes, and was attentive.   We played some volleyball, got down on the dance floor for a little while, and spent a fun Saturday night at Salty. It was a really nice change from the Scottsdale scene I'm trapped in.  The only thing I'd change is the DJ; they kept playing full 4 minute songs, mostly 2000s rap/hip-hop, and nothing that was on the charts right now... I felt like I was back at high school homecoming. They didn't have anything my friend requested either.

Meh.  I'm pretty adventurous with food, and not hard to please, but this place fell short of the mark.  Dingy, not enough seating and way too close together (I had to say "Excuse me" 5 times when leaving), they charge for EVERYTHING. That's one of the few things that has always really ground my gears when eating out - being charged 25 cents for ranch or whatnot. This place charges for to-go boxes, more than one drink refill, extra sauce, you name it. They even have a sign on the water that they'll fine you $2 if caught drinking soda out of a water cup. It just gave off a cheapskate air.  My friend had a cheeseburger that just looked blah and she said it was nothing special. I had chicken katsu, which was pretty stringy, the breading just tasted greasy, and there was not nearly enough sauce. The macaroni salad was just bleck - it was warm, eww. So was the cabbage, come to it.... everything from the display case of sides actually.  It was a lot of food for the $10 something with drink, but I barely managed half of it and in a very uncharacteristic gesture, I declined to take it home - must have been pretty bad.

"Where do you want to go for your birthday?" "That place with meat on swords!" ... Said the manly carnivore that I call my boyfriend.  Fogo totally lived up to the hype and was for sure a unique dinner.   The salad bar is epic in proportions. It's the size of my living room and family room together in length, multiplied by 2 because there's food on both sides. There were at least 10 things that I had no idea what they even were, but they were delicious vegetables or cheeses of some sort. There is a freaking barrel of parmesan cheese that you saw off a hunk yourself, for God's sake. It's amazing. I could have been happy with just the salad bar.  Then the meat. Yes, it really comes around on huge sword-like knives, and they cut you off a hunk of at your chosen temperature. I only sampled the top sirloin, rib eye and filet mignon (sad, I know), but Carnivore McGee got through 13/16 meats and by my calculations, ate over a pound and a half of meat. It was all delicious by his standards. Ladies, if you want to entertain yourself at dinner, bring your man to Fogo and watch him go from blissful looks to saying "Must... eat... just one more piece!" and struggling to force himself to wave away the servers.  The service was great too; we had no problems as some others did. There are a couple waiters who are actual waiters and manage drinks and checks and such, and there was always one of them within eyesight. The meat never stopped coming either, it was continuous throughout the hour we spent on that course. One of the meat servers (he's got thick wavy black hair and an accent) was a total sweetheart and chatted to me about how I liked my cocktail (one of their Brazilian sugar cane liquor ones) and educated my boyfriend on the 3 different cuts of lamb, and even ran back to the kitchen specifically to get him a sword of one of them. THAT was wonderful service.  Oh, and to take the mystery out of the prices (they don't list them... anywhere... "If you have to ask, you can't afford it"), here you all go:  $29.95/person at lunch, $49.95/person at dinner.  Tip: Be careful with the Caipirhinia cocktails; they are extremely strong, and they are $13.50 a pop. Some sticker shock ensued with that one when I got the bill!

This review is only for the store aspect; I have no idea what the grooming is like.  Stopped in today to check out their collar/leash selection. I am now the proud parent of a German Shepherd pup and wanted a nice sturdy leather set that would last several years.  The store is tucked into Old Town Scottsdale, and really beautifully decorated inside. They have a dog gate up at the door, so pups can run about inside (and a gate is a  good idea anyway for any grooming parlor). 3 girls were working, all pleasant.   The blonde was very helpful; she went sorting through all the collars, trying to find one that would fit but allow growth room and wasn't too girly (Nately is a boy dog, gosh darnit, no rhinestones needed!). She had personal preferences from her own large puppy and was knowledgeable about the different brands and how they would wear over time. I was impressed at the fact that she wasn't pushy; I'm used to Scottsdale sales clerks being like used car salesmen. Nope! I was hesitant, since the collars are very pricey ($65-$110), and while I have no qualms about paying that much for a good quality one that will last his whole life, I have no idea what size he needs as an adult. I explained to her that he is a rescue, and we can only guess at his age and how much he'll grow, and instead of just selling me a smaller collar, she suggested I buy a cheap nylon one now, and bring him in in a few months when he is mostly grown, and they would size him/custom order one if needed.  They also had a lot of cute dog treats and toys, all healthy stuff. I also really liked that the grooming area appeared to be completely see-through - my mom is a groomer and that is a big plus to her when a shop has nothing to hide.  We shall return!

All the reviews on here are 2 years old, except for mine and one other, so take note of that before basing your decision off Yelp!  A friend and I brought our 3 dogs (a Lab, a Lab/Pit and a German Shepherd/cattle dog) here this morning. They had an absolute blast for the most part!  The park is large without being so big you lose your dog, really clean (not one piece of poop to be found and today's owners were picking up after their dogs) and double-gated (a MUST for dog parks). The owners all seemed very attentive and were friendly to all the dogs that came up to them begging for a ball to be thrown or a scratch. I loved that the owners played with everyone's dog, not just their own.  The only real complaint I had was of one owner who brought a small terrier in, which was chasing/nipping/herding at the (all large breed) others to the point where they either wouldn't go near him or were snarling at him. He eventually jumped in the middle of a ball chase, and tripped an older Golden, who collided into my GSD. The poor Golden was traumatized and and was taken home, and my dog (who's just a pup) was freaked out and stayed under my bench for the next hour.   I understand collisions happen, but the owner made no apologies, nor was he trying to discipine his dog from his other behaviors. I'm sorry, but he's not playing WITH the others, he's being an obnoxious twat.  TL;DR for the above paragraph: Don't bring your tiny, aggressive dog into a park full of big dogs. It would be nice if they had a separate small dog area.  Otherwise ,4 stars!

Fatcat has a nice open floor and a lot of classes going on. There is something every night of the week. Decent place to go for open dancing if you're past group lesson level. Ample seating for spectators as well.  On that note, I do have to agree with other reviewers in that group lessons are just awful. We come for open dancing and will sometimes arrive early and watch the lessons, and I cringe every time. The teachers are apparently students from their "academy", people who are really not qualified to teach... often they look like college kids who have barely progressed out of basics themselves. There are plenty of other studios that have great instructors with competition wins teaching the group classes, so if you need to learn basics, I'd research any of the other studios around.  The music has been really terrible recently as well, boring and sounds like it came off a generic ballroom compilation CD. They will often change songs right in the middle. Apparently they don't have a playlist ready to go and are trying to hand run every single song.

I don't normally go to nail salons twice, because I'm never happy with them... I've been here twice and plan to go again next week :)  First visit: I did the $35 pedicure, with the paraffin wax, hot stones & leg massage. The girl was very sweet and took a good hour doing it all. The only issue was that she put the polish on WAY too thick; I was very careful for 45 minutes after; they HAD to have been dry at that point, so I stopped being careful, and next thing I know 2 of my nails had smushed up polish.   Second visit: Got a full set of acrylics, black with pink glitter tips. I believe it was Dong who did them. $30 before tip. They turned out lovely and I keep getting compliments.   It's relatively quiet inside, and the staff aren't chattering to each other like most places. They may say a sentence or two in their language (I'm not sure what it is, sorry PC police) but they're obviously not gossiping or anything. They speak very clear English to the clients, but they don't try to engage in conversation if you don't want to, and they remember everyone's names.   Definitely recommend!

I am pretty sure this place is the inner sanctum of hell.  First of all, what is the point of an "appointment" system if you have to wait 20 minutes past your appointment?   Second, who do you even check in with? The employees working were absolutely not making eye contact with anyone they were not helping.  When I finally flagged down a girl to ask that question, she gestured vaguely to the front of the store and told me "Jeremy". How am I supposed to know that? There is no "check in station" or anything. They need a board up on the wall that says "Now helping Jane" or some such system. Amazing that old school Verizon has that system but hipster Apple can't handle it...  Third, I listened to 3 other customers get helped while I waited, and EVERY SINGLE ONE was pitched a product. I mean, sure, if it's necessary, but c'mon: The poor guy next to me merely asked how to clean his screen and was sold a bottle of cleaner.   So the "genius" finally comes over and glances in my non-functioning charger port to tell me it's corroded from water damage. What? My phone has never been in water. It's never even been to the lake or near a pool. So he takes it in the back to open it up (of course, I can't see it for myself... no, no way) He comes back to insist it's water damaged, and when I told him that was nearly impossible, he got very defensive and shoved another phone at me, telling me "All I can do is sell you a new one for $149."    Mind, I've had this phone for 15 months and it's been nothing but glitches and a malfunctioning touch screen, and the lock button hasn't worked since 3 months in. So no way in hell am I purchasing another one.  Worst experience in a retail store in a LONG time.

This is a long-overdue review... I bought my car in April and kept forgetting. Whoops.  Situation: I'm self-employed with no pay stubs and only had 1 year of tax returns. I'd been driving a junker with no AC for 2 years, been carless for 2 before that, and gosh dangit, I deserved a nice new car. Most banks, however, thought otherwise since I didn't have any pay stubs, and wouldn't approve me, despite my good credit score.  After a month of tearing up rejection letters, I stopped into CarMax on a whim and asked if they could just tell me yes/no in regards to my situation. I didn't want to pick out a car and then get turned down later.  Brandon came and got me in about 5 minutes. He listened to the dilemma, pulled up my credit score, and punched in an amount I was willing to spend. 30 seconds later, several approvals popped up. I love that he just turned his monitor around and let me see all of them: the bank, interest rate, estimated payment, and stipulations.  (Funnily enough, CarMax got me the best offer, 5% lower than the second best, and it had zero stipulations except insurance proof. Amusing.)  Brandon then streamlined the car selection process; I already knew I was into either a Mustang or Camaro. He went through their inventory on the computer, wrote the options down, and off we went. I test drove 3 vehicles, but none were in the colors I wanted. He mentioned they had a black Mustang, but that it was manual. I couldn't drive manual reliably enough to risk screwing up their car, so Brandon drove me around in it. I was sold!   The paperwork part was pretty painless, no upselling or slimy stuff snuck into the contract. There is no haggling; the sticker price is what you pay, plus a $400 doc fee. No '4-square' paper, no "let me go see if my manager can give you a deal". The only negative is that the car might be a tiny bit over KBB price, but honestly I think a $500 price difference is worth it to not deal with traditional salesmen.  The finance girl was really sweet and so was the manager who stopped by.  The whole process was done and I had the keys in about 3 hours. That's amazing.  I've put about 10k miles on the car and haven't had any issues (knock on SO MUCH WOOD).   Good deals aside, I would go through CarMax again solely for the staff. I can't say enough good things about Brandon. Since I wasn't comfortable driving stick alone, he drove the new car back to Apache Junction for me. I was impressed he was willing to take an hour of time off the sales floor. He was never pushy; he went over extended warranties and when I said no, he went "Okay then" and moved on. He was incredibly patient with my constant teetering between vehicles, and at one point went back online to check the Tolleson location for more options. He was probably around my age too, which made me more comfortable, and it was easy to chat with him.

I hate taking my car in to shops. Being a petite blonde (and accidentally wearing summery dresses every time I go into one), I get a lot of attempts to take advantage of me, as most women seem to. My mechanic moved however, so I had to suck it up.  I've been in this Fletchers for a cracked coolant tank,  a vacuum hose, a flat tire, and various oil changes (my car is a POS, plainly). But anyways, the guys never try to rip me off. They're done pretty quickly usually, and do a lot of things for free. I've had them air up a spare, change my tire, and inspect the flat (30 mins worth of work) for free, and today 4 or 5 different mechanics took an interest in the awful whining issuing from my engine, and they picked it apart until finding the cause (another 20 mins), all for free. I'm used to being nickel-and-dimed with "diagnostic fees", so this is a big deal.  They even offered me a ride home and back today if I wanted to wait for my car. I have a hectic schedule and they're most accomodating, letting me do multiple appointments and ensuring I'm not late for any commitments. The guy with spiky blonde hair and glasses at the front desk is always there and is super nice, as was the shorter Hispanic gentleman that helped me today, cracking jokes and all.   They'll look up coupons for you as well, but there's plenty of them on the website to print off.   5 stars!  Edit: Also, today while they were figuring out the problem, they let me stick my nose in the engine and ask questions, and actually explained and showed me what was broken. Yeah!

I'm sorry to have to update this, but I wasn't impressed this last time I came in.  Turned out I needed a $10 EGR seal put in to pass emissions. They figured this out while I was there, and told me they could get it done that morning. Knowing I needed my rear rotors resurfaced, I told them to look at that too, and get back to me with the price. They had me leave my car for a whopping 2.5 hours, only to call and say "Uh sorry, we don't actually have that seal as we said, and you need all 4 rotors and pads, AND four new tires.... it'll be $1400 out the door... plus $25 to send someone to pick that seal up at the dealership, unless you wanna do it yourself."  I nearly had a heart attack, needless to say.  When I got back, they had also told me to get the wrong part, so it's a good thing I talked to the guy who actually looked at the car. I added up all the "work" I needed done according to their board, and it should have come to around $900, including putting in this seal (which the guy flippantly told me "Ah yeah, it's a $10 part and it'll take half an hour, but it's labor of $100".  Screw my two college degrees, I need to become a mechanic!  To top it off, I know I do not need all four tires - I just had two of them done and they are rated for another 30k miles.   I'm really disappointed to have to write this review, but I'll be taking my car elsewhere. I called Honest-1 Auto in Glendale, and they quoted me $53 for the exact same labor. Ding!

We came in here to buy a refurbished Xbox One. They had it for $60 less than Walmart or Best Buy, and the games were priced well, so we figured we'd do well here.  Everything was fine until my SO asked the guy if he knew which games were backward compatible. The guy immediately launched into "Well I have to ask YOU... Why Xbox and not Playstation?" I rolled my eyes and went outside, while SO politely listened to a 15 minute rant/'pitch' about why the PS4 was better. Of course it's better, it's $80 more.   He was very short with us after we decided to go with the Xbox anyway. SO really, really wanted Star Wars: Battlefront. The guy rudely told him it had no solo player at all, that you HAD to play online with other people. This is not true. Then he tried to upsell him a Kinect and got further attitude when we said no.   Will go back to a big box store next time.

I just got back from Avalon and  am still stewing over my evening. My student stylist was great; the instructor was awful; and minor things about the facility and pricing were the icing on this 1 star cake.   A very close friend of mine is taking classes there. My mother had gotten her hair permed by her a few weeks prior, and it came out great - she only commented on how long it took (about 4 hours).  Eh, it's a school. I booked myself for bleaching my roots and a cut, quoted $28 on the phone.  Let's reiterate before I go on: This is a school, so anything that happens to you is not the fault of the student. It is the fault of the instructor, who has to be consulted at every step and often helps with the applications. There is no reason for anything bad to happen to your hair, unless your student is saddled with a subpar instructor, like Melanie.  I arrived at 5:30 and no bleach was even applied until 6:30, because my friend (let's call her D)  had to literally hunt down Melanie, and get approval.   This woman came over and started discussing my hair, which is platinum blonde. Upon explaining that a gold band in my hair was from D's previous attempt at bleaching with 20 vol, and telling her that my normal stylist uses 40 vol bleach left on for 40 minutes, I received an EXTREMELY condescending lecture (literally, baby talk style) on how "our students are only taught to work according to manufacturer directions" and they don't use past 20 vol. That's stupid, IMO, since they will encounter clients (like me!)  who need a higher level than that. But whatever, I'm not that picky, so I told her to go ahead and try it.. mostly to shut her up.  THEN she starts lecturing me that due to something about the bleach taking, I need to do my roots every 3-4 weeks. Why yes, of course I do, of course I should give you money more often... what a load of bullshit. My normal girl never has a problem with 6-8 weeks of regrowth.   We finally get the bleach applied. Somehow when it was rinsed off, there was a small spot of dark left. I told D not to worry about it, A) because I didn't care and it wasn't noticeable when dry, and B) because I've had this happen before, and re-bleaching it does NOT fix it... but she said she "had to" because Melanie would make her. Sure enough, she did waste another hour on that. The whole time, she was extremely short and rude to D. No, it did not fix the spot.  In between every step, we had to wait 10 minutes for Melanie. Apparently instructors are only assigned to one row, yet she was constantly in the other rows, ignoring her own. Even upon someone fetching her, she kept repeating "I'll be right there" and walking past us to get to other students (again, not in her row even). This nonsense added 45 minutes to the total time.   Somewhere between the bleaching and toner, Melanie realized that she was being somewhere close to "evil" on the meanness scale, and turned into an utter kiss ass, being sickly sweet to both of us. This went on about half an hour... most of which was spent mixing a toner... which she then applied to my scalp, practically RIPPING my hair out with her strokes, and which also burned. Toner should not burn.   By now it's about 9:15. The school closes at 10. Melanie tells me "We're not going to have time for your haircut", then bends over and again in babytalk says "Would that be okay if you came back another day for a haircut?"   I wanted to punch her. No, it's not okay. You booked me for a service, it took this long because YOU screwed up and kept vanishing, and I drove here from south Scottsdale. Also, you have 45 minutes, plenty of time. What the hell.  I made my displeasure plain and got my "haircut", but just told them to trim the longest layers, because she was huffy about the time, and I thought she'd probably morph into a vampire bat and latch onto my neck if I asked for an actual layered cut.  I finally go to pay and they announced it was $43. What happened to $28? They charged me for the TONER and for EXTRA PRODUCT. Who DOES that? Lightening generally involves toning, it all needs to be included in the price, and I shouldn't be charged for the "extra product" from a stylist's screwup. One of the girls did give me $6 off, but it was still annoying to be quoted $28, then nickel and dimed up to $43.  And if that wasn't enough Melanie for the day, she came over as I was paying to say "See, it's not as yellow as it was before."   Gee, cute, trying to validate yourself that you actually didn't do a pretty terrible job on my hair.  Oh, and the facility gripes:  this is apparently their new location and appears very haphazardly put together. The mirrors wobble constantly (I actually overheard some girls saying a wall of them had crashed down), half the sinks only run ice water, a couple were already broken, and there is only 1 bathroom for the probably 60 people in there at a time.

I've been to 7th Heaven twice. The first time, there was a teenage girl working who dismissively said "hi" to me and that was it. I was looking at shoes, which they have to get your size for you out of a closet, and she never once asked if she could help me. Terrible. I avoided the place after that.  I went back last week as a last ditch effort since Fascinations had nothing for shoes, and Tiffany was working. She was super, super sweet and helpful. She dug through the closet multiple times for me (I'm extremely picky... so sue me), and upon not finding my size in a style I liked, suggested I at least try one size up in one of the brands; tada, they fit! Woohoo! She was even genuinely happy that they fit and that I could leave with a pair of shoes.  As Kelly said, they do give 15% off for dancers and offer a shoe warranty for $4, where they'll repair your soles or heels. This is a steal since shoes are $50+ and the soles often wear out in 6 months, and unless you looooove blisters, who really wants to buy a new pair and have to break them in all over again?   Minus one star only because they have kind of a limited selection of dresses and like everywhere else, are usually out of stock on 7/8/9s in shoes.

I came in here today to have my grinding brakes looked at. My 2 stars are based solely on my customer service experience. I didn't let them work on my car.  Strike 1: A mechanic came in and said "Is that your Mustang?"  "Yes."  "Thought so. I'll tell the guys to stop making fun of it, har har." Rude, unprofessional, not cool to say to a customer.  Strike 2: Presenting me with the repair bill and no explanation of anything, just a lot of "This is the EMERGENCY, BARE MINIMUM".  I did not appreciate being handed a $570 bill for just the front brakes and calipers, with no explanation whatsoever and a lot of high pressure "I just need the okay to get started" despite me repeating a few times that I needed to check out my financial situation first.   Strike 3: Upon  telling the manager I would be taking the car elsewhere to get a second opinion, he launched into what I consider a tantrum. "SECOND OPINION? Second opinion? I gave you the cheapest price around. You won't get better. Grumble grumble, mumble."  Took off to the back without another word. I then had to wait a good 10 minutes for a mechanic to pull my car around... guess customer service drops off a cliff when the customer decides they might want to check other options out.  I took the car to Sun Devil Auto, who actually explained what was wrong with the brakes, told me I did NOT need new calipers, and that there was another more minor problem causing the wear on my brake pads. They didn't use high pressure sales, they didn't try to scare me with  words like "emergency", and the staff was all extremely nice.

No, no, no, no.  If I could give 0 stars, I would. I flip this place off every time I drive past.  Don't ask me why my dear other half thought this was a good place to take a classic car, but he did.    They charged $1000 for various things.  I don't remember the details of part names, but here goes the original bill: - $400 worth of "It needs this, oh wait, no it doesn't, it needs THIS", AKA replacing the same parts twice and charging for their mistakes - $100 worth of useless bullshit - $500 for a rebuilt carburetor, that had been rebuilt several times already. Why not just rebuild the one in the car? (An original part from 1969, and avoid after-market parts on a classic car!)  Oh wait, that would be intelligent.  He took the car home. The next day, it refused to start. Out of money, he let it sit quite a while before another attempt.  We took it to Whitey's down the road, who diagnosed it as the carburetor dumping fuel (um, what, that was replaced.)  They were correct though. So, back to Meineke we went, on Whitey's suggestion, to confront them.  Most auto parts are warrantied for a year. Or a certain mileage. Or something. This would have been within a year, and the car had been driven 10 miles since it was put in. A whole 10 miles.   They were RUDE as hell, confrontational, and defensive from the get-go. They gave him the run-around about "I have to call the manufacturer and call you back", blah blah blah. The guy then began lecturing him on "Why did you take it somewhere else?! That may void the warranty."  I got pissed at this, and piped up  "Why would he take it back somewhere that raked him for $1000 and plainly couldn't fix the issue? They only diagnosed it, they didn't work on it, so that doesn't void warranties."  Of course this resulted in the nastiest glare I've ever gotten from a "customer service" representative, and of course the part wasn't under warranty after that.  SCREW YOU, MEINEKE.

I came out to Long Wongs for a friend who was performing at one of their artist showcases.  Not having had dinner, I was looking forward to the wings so highly touted on Yelp. Guess what? It was about 9pm and the kitchen had been shut down. 9 pm. Who does that? Especially when you have an event going on that night...   My drink was watered down as well, wasn't too pleased about that. So now I'm out $5 for a can of Red Bull basically, and I'm starving.  The bartenders were also asked by multiple people who was playing that night or what kind of music it was and they had no idea. That's a little silly. I get that you have a showcase once a week, but keep a list at the bar or something each week, it ain't that hard. Even telling people if it's rock or rap or reggae would be appreciated.

I had a good time and that's all there is to it. If you expect it to be a little cheesy, you'll be fine.   Went with my buddies who are big 70s/80s metal fans (yes, I'm including hair metal in that). It looks like a country/biker bar, but does mostly the 80s hair metal for music. We had a great ol' time rocking out to all the Poison, Def Leppard, Warrant, etc. The girls on the bartop poles were lovely to watch, though a few seemed off in their own world, not caring too much about the crowd or entertaining... there were a couple (a brunette in all black and a caramely-brown haired girl in a red top) that were smokin' hot and killing it on the poles though.  The place was absolutely PACKED on a Saturday around 11pm. Restrooms were clean, beers were a bit pricey (I think $5 for a bottle of Bud), but it was a good time and I'll be back.

As my legal drinking years rack up each birthday, I get less and less patient with the Old Town scene, and Shotgun Bettys is now off the list.  First off, this place is so crowded you can't move. It makes it kinda tough to enjoy, and even tougher to get a drink - you have to push your way between the ogling dudes at the front who are not giving up their primo seats for anything.  The roving waitresses are extremely annoying - they have no sections obviously, so you get asked every 5 minutes if you need something, even if you're sitting there with nearly full drinks.  The bartenders have been uber bitchy the last several times; yes we know, you're hot enough to work here, but you're still just a bartender in the service industry. Drop the act. One of my lady friends ordered Grateful Deads, and was handed 2 shots. What the???  Upon correcting the bartender that they were actual drinks, she got such a horrible look that she refused to go back to the bar... oh, and also received 2 undrinkable drinks. Seriously, these were terrible. My Long Island at $8 was just as bad - literally tasted like rubbing alcohol. I had to order a Coke to chase swallows of it with.  Curious as to WHY our drinks were so awful, I squeezed up to the bar to see what liquor they used. Good luck would have it that the dude next to me also ordered a Long Island, and I found out why it tasted like rubbing alcohol - for your $8 drink, you get it made with Montezuma tequila and Barton's gin. Oh, and not shaken, just layered on with maybe 1/4" Coke on top.   ... FFS, that is disgusting. My bartender friends would be horrified. They need to hire some girls that actually know how to mix a drink.  For the final act, I got stared down as I signed my tab - I don't know if she was afraid I was gonna steal her precious pen, or she was trying to intimidate me into a bigger tip, but it was awkward.

The first quirky thing I discovered when I moved to Tempe was self-serve yogurt bars - they are EVERYWHERE, the hottest trend with college kids now. Being an indecisive soul, I was hooked on the concept of getting to mix all the flavors and toppings.   I was delighted as all heck when Twisted Cultures opened 5 minutes from my parents house. They are the same concept as the Tempe ones: pick your flavors, pick your toppings, pay by weight. They have some really unique flavors (Red Velvet Cake? Margarita? Really?!) and they secured the elusive 5th star by one-upping Mojo and Yogurtini - they have a rack of "sauces". Hot fudge, hot buttered pecans, whipped cream, raspberry sauce, even chocolate frosting in a spray can - epic win. With all these goodies, when asked what was in his cup one of my friends simply replied "Stuff".  But delicious stuff.  The inside is always super nice and clean, flat screen TVs, those little Chinese folding screens around one of the tables for groups or private convos. The teenage girls working could be a little more professional but perhaps it's because they feel they can chill out for my usual group of young 20 somethings. They also do a "secret word" every Thursday for half off, just find them on Facebook.

So good!  We stopped in last night, joking that we'd kill two birds with one stone, getting tipsy off our food (gotta be efficient with all the holiday bustle!)  The ice cream was SO GOOD. We had the Black Russian Kahlua, Jack Daniels Zebra and Salted Caramel Cognac.It was all delicious. They even give you little waffle cone slices that are so light and sugary and crunchy.. mmm. This is the real deal, btw - they ID you and everything, and a pregnant lady was warned away from the booze-infused flavors.  To top it off, the girl at the counter was soooooo nice. She explained how it's made, let us try 2 or 3 flavors each, gave us punch cards, joked around, etc etc. It was so refreshing to have friendly help in a store like this (usually staffed by gum-snapping, bored teenagers).

We hit Firehouse for the first time on Friday, and I can see why several of my friends will hang out here most of the night.  It's really big compared to most of the clubs in Old Town. There is no technical, cordoned-off dance floor, but people just get up and groove next to the tables on the floor. There's plenty of seating, on that note - big cozy booths that comfortably fit 6 people, or tables for 4 on the floor, plus the really long bar.  It looks like a warehouse with red and black "fire engine" decor - really cool vibe.  The DJ was playing a nice mix of top 40s music and he actually knew how to fade songs in and out of each other and not mess up the beat. He also wasn't doing little 30 second snippets of songs (a super annoying pet peeve to me), you got a solid 2 minutes of your favorite jam. Kudos for getting a decent DJ!  I'd give them the 5th star if they got a requisite fireman's pole and stuck a go-go dancer on it - that would be awesome.

Canteen is refreshing among the "strictly-a-bar" bars on Mill Avenue. They serve food, and pretty good food at that. It's evident they are making a good effort to not just be another place for the frat boys to get sloshed on Fridays, but to be a good place to day drink or have a happy hour snack.   My friend and I come to Canteen often during the school year to have a margarita and tacos after class. The service has always been really good, the bartenders know how to make a good drink, and the outside patio is pleasant with misters and even purse hooks under the bar (which I got wayyyy too excited about the first time).  I've been once or twice on a weekend night, and the bouncers were surprisingly nice for Mill Avenue, the bartender efficient, the drinks just as good as their non-rushed counterparts, and while the dance floor is small, the DJ was pretty good and everyone was having a blast.

Why would you close your kitchen 30 minutes before your listed hours? That's just bad business.  Maybe that's not how it is in Thailand, but in every American restaurant I've ever been in, you can walk in at 9:27 and get served. Yes, it's s****y of you to do so, but the hours listed are the hours the kitchen is open.

Again with the hype for Old Town bars... Yet another friend said, "You have to try ABC Bar", this time being El Hefe. Yet another bar failed to live up to the recommendation.  (Though in retrospect, her recommendation was probably due to her running into the same old man who liked to buy all her drinks every time... should have taken that into account).  Strike 1: So loud I can't hear myself. Literally engaging my diaphragm and voice projection training just to make myself heard to my friends and the waitresess.  Strike 2: The tacos are not that great. They have duck, which is the only really saving grace about them, but they're like $5 for this little tiny,1/4 of a tortilla sized taco. They tasted pretty boring to me.  Strike 3: I had to hunt down my waitress. I mean, I walked around for 10 minutes looking for her to cash out, and this place is SMALL. I was very tempted to walk out on the tab just due to the crappy service..  Strike 4: We got water dumped on us due to the awnings outside. The manager sent us a round of shots, and he wasn't fooling anybody, they were pure grapefruit juice. Gee, thanks for filling my Vitamin C requirement...?  Oh snap, 4 strikes and you are definitely out of the park for good, El Hefe.

Back story: I was misdiagnosed by a state healthcare clinic (the one on 7th Ave downtown... avoid at all costs... I only went because it was the only urgent care open so late). This first place ignored my suggestion of "I'm pretty sure I have pneumonia, this pain in my chest on breathing matches that" and doped me up on a bunch of conflicting pain killers and muscle relaxers that resulted in an overdose from just 2 of them (luckily I came out of it without hospitalization, thank God I didn't take all 3)  I went to Doctors Express the next day based on the Yelp reviews. I was seen promptly. The doctor, an older lady, LISTENED to my symptoms, actually took a stethoscope to me (the other place hadn't). and said 'Yep, you have a pneumonia in your right lung."    She was absolutely appalled by the amount and kinds of medication Place #1 had given me - one, an antibiotic for an accidentally discovered urinary tract infection, was in a high enough dose to damage my kidneys, and 2 of the painkillers were known to cause seizures when mixed. She took me off those, lowered the antibiotic dose, and gave me a Z-pack.  She was efficient, nice, a no-BS type, and I had no more pain in my chest after 3 days of her meds. AND they have discount cards for your prescriptions. I wish I had just gone here first and avoided a week of scary-ness/people who really should not have medical degrees.   Bonus: The waiting room is pleasant! It's carpet, not tile, which makes a big difference in not thinking you're at the doctors, and smells nice. It's the little things :)

Oh, pardon moi, for daring to venture into Old Town in holy jeans and a band sweatshirt, and not appearing to be a Scottsdale resident... I will gladly show you my drivers license with address if it will make your attitude disappear. Sheesh.  The Tempe location is a LOT more friendly than this one.  The two guys at the counter, and even the gentleman waiting for his coffee, stared me down all the way from the door to the register. They were very short when I ordered, all whilst staring me down rather coldly. The menu is not above the counter, it's hidden in the corner (menus aren't "cool", I guess). My drink took FOREVER to make. $5 for a "large" mocha that's the size of every other coffee shop's small. Etc, etc.  Seriously, I have to continue in the employee vein because they are THAT unpleasant. All the employees are my second biggest irk about Cartel. You are not God's gift to the earth, you are a flannel-wearing, college-dropout hipster who works in a coffee shop for $8 an hour. There wouldn't be anything wrong with working for $8/hr in a coffee shop and wearing flannel, if you didn't get an attitude about it.  And my number one irk about Cartel is: why the eff can't I have a cappuccino to go? I don't understand. It's my overpriced cup of coffee, I can do what I want with it. I don't need your coffee snob attitude to tell me a to-go cup will "ruin" my coffee... because IT WON'T.   The fact I have two irks about this place that combine for unpleasant experiences mean I won't be back. Adios Cartel!

Wow. After stumbling across the below rebuttal to a review for their Tempe location, I will NEVER patronize Cartel again. You know what, Jason? If you don't like someone's bad review of your business, either offer to correct the problem or ignore it - don't insult them further. This is truly a disgusting attitude to have.   "Wow  Dave! You are hilarious! If only you actually understood coffee, you might have been able to actually promote better coffee in AZ! You shouldn't be commenting about coffee since you drink it with caramel anyway. You should probably rethink that life decision! As for your bad customer service experience, i deeply apologize for that! They no longer work for us. I would be happy to send you a bag of our coffee in the mail, so you dont have to come in. You just have to promise me you will taste before you add! Email me - jason@cartelcoffeelab (BTW - could you please clean up the profanity?)"

We really like Barney's and usually start off the evening there, to grab some food and a starter drink.  The food is reasonably priced and pretty good for being a "divey" sort of bar. They have alligator! The only caveat I would mention is that the wings are breaded, which I wasn't expecting.  The bartenders are hit-or-miss. It can be tough to get service on the upstairs patio (which is a great view of Old Town!). The women up there are, 9 times out of 10, rude and tend to ignore me a lot. One of them, however, was freaking awesome and made us a drink called a Swedish Fish - it's "gummy" flavored vodka with a bunch of other stuff, and it tastes EXACTLY like a Swedish Fish!   On the drink note, they have a lot of awesome house drinks that are cleverly named and usually colorful. The S.H.I.T. (Scottsdale Homemade Iced Tea) is a great version of a Long Island. We always get some kind of surprise here: after the Swedish Fish, another time we were presented with tickets for "alligator shots" and yet another time, we got "Jello shots" that were in syringes.   The 3 levels are a lot of fun; there's a lobster claw game, a giant Jenga game, and beer pong on the second level. The first floor has a giant "shot wheel" but alas it has never worked in the 9 months we've been going to Barney's. Shame, as it looks like fun.  The blank spot on the wall near the stairwell also may or may not be from my friend stealing a sign.... I'd apologize, but I think it's far too late for that.

Stumbled on this place after getting my fingerprints done next door. The garage door was open on this lovely spring day, and the big open hole in the shopping mall makes you go "Oooh, what is THIS?" and want to go inside, so in I went.  The mocha I got was amazing. The espresso has that nutty flavor and the chocolate was richer than most places. It was so good that I returned the next day... and the next day... at this point, I'm driving from Scottsdale out to Arcadia, bypassing at least 5 other coffee joints, just to go to Black Cat. It's that good.  On the subsequent visits, I got their toddy; WOW. I generally can't drink coffee with no sweetener, but this toddy was awesome. It wasn't bitter and was delicious with just a bit of milk. And the caffeine! I'm almost immune to caffeine at this point in my college career, but half of a large toddy kept me wide awake and productive from about 8pm untill after midnight. Schwing!  The atmosphere is really really cool; no hipster vibe at all, lots of young professionals working. They have dog water bowls outside, and yesterday there was a guy with his German Shepherd pup sound asleep on the floor next to him; it was adorable and so cool that they were allowed to sit just inside the garage door and nobody was spazzing out. There's art and music without being overpoweringly hipster snob. The staff are really sweet and laidback; the one guy says "No worries!" to everything.   They have a punch card deal too, and it's buy 9, get one free, not buy 10 like everywhere else. Winning!  The triple berry parfait I had yesterday afternoon is the only thing I'm knocking down stars on; it didn't feel as ice cold as a dairy product should, and that made me wonder if it had been kept at the "safety zone" temperature. The yogurt was kind of watery, not the thick consistency you'd expect, and some of the berries were mush essentially. It was delicious until about halfway through when it turned very acidic-tasting... and I got heartburn (which I NEVER get) after eating it.  I think I will stick to the very scrumptious-looking cakes and muffins from now on, because this parfait was iffy.

I used to work for KK, under the "Doughnut Dan" franchise, and it seems like it's all just going downhill.  We were at 2, but are now down to one star, due to that I just got halfway through my latte and got a CLUMP of what looks like curdled milk. I opened the lid to find tons of them.   Nasty, dude. Bleeping disgusting. I better not get sick.  (Other things I do not like:)  Most of the coffee drinks. They use Ghirardelli syrup (I have no idea why this makes them taste funny, but it does), and all the drinks taste "off". The white chocolate mocha tastes like sickly sweet alcohol syrup, the regular mocha tastes like cardboard half the time, and everything caramel is just way too sweet.   I'm not fond of them not trucking in enough donuts - don't go in the evening, you won't have any left according to half the reviews, and if you do they were delivered at 5:15 am that morning; hardly day-old, but they won't live up to the hype if you get them at 7 pm. They need to go back to baking twice a day, just deliver fewer donuts at each time so they don't waste so much.  The staff at this location are dumber than a box of rocks, but hey, so is everyone I worked with at mine (it's $8/hr, I guess I should stop being so picky). The woman gave us too many of the wrong donuts, my drink a size larger (because they were out of iced cups - again, Y U always out of things, KK?), and hot when it was ordered iced. It also tasted like sugar free vanilla syrup, BLECK.

We started a birthday evening here on Friday night, around 9pm.   Minor observations: It was dead except for 7 or 8 people at the bar, and it remained dead until we left at 10:30. That's kind of sad for a Mill Avenue bar - we went to Rula Bula across the street and it was packed wall to wall, so it ain't just the time. We were looking for a party and had to go elsewhere... perhaps this will get better with time.   The music kept cutting in and out the whole time. Seriously, fix your sound system.  Security looked absolutely ridiculous; very stern stocky bouncer types, with an air of stern regulation of a wild party... regulating an empty bar. Not really a gripe, but it did make me snort at how silly it looked.  Most of the staff was not smiling at all. They did not look happy to be working. However, the guy running the bull for us was pleasant and it was fun to watch him lull people into a false sense of "I got this!" and then throw them off. He seemd to be enjoying his job at least.   Major gripe: The waitress. I don't know her name, but her ass was hanging out of her shorts and she was ditzier than Paris Hilton.  We were the only table and waited 15 minutes for any attention.   The waitress finally pranced over with menus, pushed us to get food like she was Vanna White and the menu a Wheel of Fortune puzzle, and then seemed very miffed when we declined.  One of the guys asked if they had any ciders on tap, and she went "Ummm, I really don't know *giggle*".  "Well, what do you have that's a lighter beer?"  "Ummm... Coors and Bud?"   *facepalm*   They did have Angry Orchard, which is kind of OBVIOUSLY a cider and a very memorable name... how do you not know what beer is in the giant apple tap? How do you work in a bar and not know what beer you have in general?!  Birthday boy wanted to go on the mechanical bull, and we had to ask Little Miss Prancy Pants to get the bull operator multiple times... she kept "forgetting"... yes, because one table is a LOT to keep up with.  Then, to really add the cherry on top, she ignored me completely. I am not exaggerating at all, she went around the table and literally skipped over me... Luckily I didn't want a drink anyway, but to SKIP someone at the table is just unacceptable.  Auto-reply to the owner who seems to respond to all negative reviews: I didn't seek a manager out because I didn't want to be the complainer at the birthday party, nor did I want to spend the rest of our time there being given the stink eye by Prancy Pants. Yelp reviews are the best way to get attention these days, so that's what I do when a place sucks, and I will update my review if/when I have a better experience.

Every time we go here, the bouncers try to mess with me. I've had them go so far as to tell me there was a warrant out for my arrest after they scanned my ID (which is not funny, because some scanners really can pick that up). If they're not pulling something like that, they're checking my picture against my face for a good minute before deciding it's not a fake.   This last time though really irritated me. I hand this Duck Dynasty wannabe my ID and watch him read it. I guess that was suspicious, because he looked up from it and stared at me intently. I stared right back, and apparently he didn't like that, because he then asked "Where are you coming from?"  "Oh, the Tim McGraw concert."  He gets this super serious look. "How much have you had to drink?"  Which really ticked me off, because I had not had one single sip of alcohol all night.  "Nothing. At all."    Phil Jr. stares at me some more, and finally lets me in, but I remained annoyed for the rest of the evening.   Being treated like you're underage with a fake, or already drunk when you're not, gets really old when it's every single time you get to a bar.

We gave this place a shot on Friday night. My roommate had really liked day drinking here, so why not?  We stand in line to get in. The first 3 of us are good to go. Then the "bouncer" refuses to let my boyfriend in. Why? Because he's wearing sneakers. Roommate's boyfriend got in wearing sneakers, no problemo. "Oh, but his have his jeans over his tongues."  "Ohhh-kay, I'll put my jeans over my tongues."  "No man, you can't do that."  What the heck?   Roommate returns at this point with a friend that works inside, who waves the bouncer off and lets my boyfriend in.  Roommate and boyfriend pick a spot at the bar, get their drinks. I stand at the same exact spot and get told not once, but FOUR times by different staff that I need to move; first to the right, then back to the left, and repeat. Apparently you are in the way of the super special flowers that are the staff no matter where you stand.  $15 plus tip for a bottle of Coors Light and a Long Island (made with bottom shelf, plastic bottle liquor).   No dance floor. Constant "bottle service parades" of 5-6 people with strobe light wands got old real fast.  And then for the piece de resistance, we watched them  let in a bunch of guys wearing shorts, t-shirts and slip-on Toms type shoes..  We will not be back.

I got tattooed by Mineka yesterday.   Super clean shop, and very efficient up front. Lots of really pretty, unique jewelry for sale if you have piercings.  Mineka did a great job on the ink; she has serious talent for sure. I'm really pleased with how it turned out. The price was unbelievably reasonable too. She has a great personality too; she is incredibly patient and actually encouraged resizing the stencil multiple times until I was sure it was right; other artists have been impatient about this. Parts of my tattoo REALLY hurt, and she was hilarious, making silly noises and telling stories to distract me. It was probably the most fun I've had getting ink.  I will totally be coming back to this shop!

Really thought I'd like this place, heard great things from friends... alas.  Super pretentious L.A. type atmosphere. Loud music, plus the acoustics made all the talking combine into a racket of its own. Our server was... odd. I can't put my finger on it. He seemed pretentious in his own way. He never addressed me, but spoke to my fiancé the entire time.   Got the Fez burger and the Tangier burger. Both were cold. There was a long list of delicious sounding things that were supposedly on them, but they all must have either been not there in adequate amounts, or just mixed together, because the Fez just tasted like a cold burger on a ciabatta bun, and the Tangier tasted like a cold burger on a ciabatta bun (with pesto).   You don't get fries; those are an extra $3; you get a 'salad' which is just carrots, lettuce and arugula. The lemon basil dressing was really good, but most of my greens had nasty black spots.. only half was edible.   We didn't send anything back as we were in a hurry and I didn't feel like arguing with managers.  Total for 2 burgers, one with added fries and $3 for added bacon, was $34. That's pretty pricey, especially considering the state of the food.   I think this is one of those places that isn't very good, but it's popular and pricey (so it must be good!), and you want to fit with the hipster crowd, so you pretend to love it and go there all the time.
