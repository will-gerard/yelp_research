Some of the freshest sushi we've had in AZ. We've been here several time with the kids and they are consistently impressing us. Not easy to do when you're used to the sushi in SF and Seattle. Highly recommended.

Clean, friendly and quality work.  Happy wife, makes me happy.  I'd definitely recommend this place.  Make sure to bring cash for a tip.

Recently its become really run down, dirty, crowded and over priced.  We've had a family membership since 2013 and have enjoyed the experience overall. However over the past year it seems that they have really oversold subscriptions, let the equipment break and not fix it. There's also the matter of dirty lockers with wet nasty towels laying allover especially the showers, and the majority of the shower heads are broken and leaking. Sad considering how nice it was when we joined. I miss Mountainside Fitness I'd absolutely go back to them if we lived closer. I'd highly suggest talking to people that are working out about their reality if you're doing a tour. It's now gotten to a point we're going to start actively look for a better gym in 2016.

Very happy with Brian and the crew at Neos MedSpa.  We've been on the HCG diet and have had great results.  Love how you're able to get into ketosis very quickly and keep burning fat (and not muscle).  The staff are great to work with, very friendly and knowledgeable.  I'd recommend using them if you're interested in any of their services.

Bought a new Volvo from Volvo of Tempe and the sales portion of things was good. Now the Service Department is the opposite of good. Had an appointment at 2 but didn't get started until 3, minor thing but that meant the rest of the day was shot. Had to get some parts replaced but it turned out that they had ordered the wrong parts, how is that possible I bought the car from you and you have the VIN in your system?  Then when we had an insurance claim we wanted to have the repairs done by a "Volvo Authorized Body Shop" which they had a plaque on the wall for, but they refused to meet the industry standard rates as they cost $72 / hr more than that and refused to meet the rates even when Volvo of Phoenix would.   I highly recommend you go somewhere else if you want good service!

Update: We just bought a XC90 for our son here. Kim the sales guy was great as always. While we were there we learned that the previous service person and the department manager had left the company. So we gave them another shot with fixing a loose headliner in our 2013 C70. The new service manager was very professional and took great care of the car. It's amazing what a difference good people make. We'll be taking our two Volvo's to Volvo of Tempe for service.

I'm torn between the quality product and the poor service and WiFi.    The coffee is exceptional but the entry fee (getting past the flaming hoops of attitude) to get your coffee is a little high.  Now I guess I'm one of the cool kids at times (working for the man - Buring Man), but unless that comes up in conversation, most often I'm not dressed the part in my business casual and just another target for the staff.  Beyond the slow service and attitude, the WiFi is crap.  They are riding a signal from a neighbor companies (Wet Paint) router.  I wish they'd get their own router and Cox connection!  Hell I'd even set it up for them, and when I suggested putting a WiFi tip jar the customers at the bar were all for it!  I like the location and the product but not the service and WiFi - both things that can be fixed.

First time trying it and it didn't disappoint.  We opted for take out so no dine in review, but the food was really good.  We'll be back.

Had some old gold jewelery laying around and thought I'd sell it.  After doing some research I decided to use Valley Goldmine and I couldn't be happier!  I worked with Tim and he was very professional and I got top dollar for the jewelery.  I highly recommend Valley Goldmine!  They are a company that treats you right.
