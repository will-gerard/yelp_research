Very pleased with this World Market.  The prices are good for the wine glasses I've bought there (good selection too!).  The wine is good everyday wine, and priced reasonably.  The help is always friendly and courteous, and the food section---(well, I've been there at least 6 times, and I always seen to find something new in the food section!). The only reason I give it four stars instead of five, is the parking arrangement and it is not easy to get into its' parking lot.... I think the prices here ae better than Pier One....By far!

Center of Phoenix Proper!  Open 24 hrs!  Kinda makes you want to be sick just to go there and scoot through the Drive-Through!  For me, it is extremely user friendly due to several things: Terrific location, great parking, 24 hour pharmacy (that means open-round-the-clock-----lol), and for me personally, a decent selection of candy!!!  Yea! (My Achilles heel)...    The business is kept clean, well lit, and their prices are moderate for most personal care items.  You won't wait long in the check-out area, and there's lots of stuff to look at so that they get the spending hook into you....Just stepping outside, your blood pressure drops five points because you no longer have the shaving creme, nail files, or magazines all screaming at you---saying "Did you forget something?!"  Over-all, this CVS does what it is intended to do---they are available, clean, and centrally located to get your fix of meds and stuff!  The "Best-of-Health To Ya!"  PS. They have a frequent buyers bonus program to help give you discounts for buying there over time...

Not only was the food exceptional in every way imaginable, the service at this location and this evening was perfect (No! Better than perfect!).  The setting was as expected, cockles and netting with pictures of fish everywhere, but the best part for me tonight was the service to match the quality of the meal.  The  waiter was timely, Intuitive about me and my friend's needs to be left to converse freely!  WoW!  The more I think about it, the more I want to introduce people to this restaurant for that personal touch alone.  I recommend The Fish market here for all of the above.  If you have any regrets at all, it will be that you had to leave...but believe me, you will leave with a wholesome feeling of content and peace, having paid for a decent and equitable meal, coupled with service and a sense of sincerity from your server.---(Or did I get lucky?...."NOT!"), it was genuinely terrific all the way around.

I agree with Jake...Mediocre at best....  Boring layout and unkempt when busy....Busy frequently! Finding a seating area off the main path is a plus!  The main path feels and looks like an over sized hallway...Beware!  I have been to other CPK's and this one is layed out poorly compared to others I've been to (San Luis Obispo in California, San Francisco in the Business District, and one in Scottsdale close to Bell and Scottsdale Blvd.---Very nice!)  At this particular location, service was a disaster this past Wednesday evening after work 02-13-08.  ----The two dishes ordered were: Tomato Basil Spaghettini with goat's cheese, and the second dish was Fettuccine with Garlic Cream Sauce with Chicken.  Both dishes came out at the same time---The Tomato Basil Spaghettini was warmish, at best...The Garlic with Cream Sauce with Chicken had no Chicken! ---(had to be returned to the kitchen) .  I asked the waiter to please return mine to a hot oven or lamp so that I could begin at the same time as my guest...  All this time the waiter acted as if he were doing us a favor, as if we were disturbing him from sorting his receipts from his other poorly served customers!  When the food finally arrived, my dish was even colder, just mildly warm!#!$#!    I recommend that if you are out to impress a guest in any capacity, this is not that place to take them...Go next door to the Cheesecake Factory!  I'm not sure about the service, but the whole layout at least,  looks inviting and clean.

I have not had every single thing on the menu, but I have had plenty of exposure to their 'Modus Operendi' ....and let me tell you, it is a FULL FIVE STARS for service, quality of food fare, location, environment (inside and out!), atmosphere (design), and the attention to detail with regards to our needs as customers.  The later being the most noticeable and appreciated. The waiter's timing and concern for our needs was uncanny, from the moment my friend and me sat down to the moment we were ready to lean foreword and depart to other realms! The decor is well balanced and not suffocating.  I felt a sense of privacy, yet not forgotten in the crowd...I would Highly recommend this location for any form of date or professional get-together.  rest assured that you will not have to think about arrangements for you and say up to four people...More than that, and you might want to call ahead and see that they can accommodate to your liking.  Otherwise---"Bone-That's-Petite!"

At this location, it's easy to tumble in, buy healthy anything and everything, and tumble out....So why four stars and not five?---They use to have Ben and (you know)ice creme, Chunky Monkey---No more....:( But they have fruit, juices, nuts, eggs, cereal, sodas, wines, meats, on, and on, and on...even recycled bags! (though I wouldn't eat the bags....) It's a bit pricey...Why so pricey?---I guess for the privilege of buying something healthy?...vs...something fabricated by DOW chemicals and produce shot full of altered chromosomal waste!

The Worst Haircut I Have Ever Grieved Over Was Here!  What is it about cheap or inexpensive?  Does that mean they are all rejects from the Hair Cut Academy or what?....I think I could have cut my hair better if I could have stood behind myself and had sheers.  I guess in this case, I got what I paid for...The haircut was a disaster, even when I explained to the woman to just cut a 1/4 inch off everywhere for shape, she cut the hair down to 1/4 inch from my scalp!!!!!$#@@!##@!#@  I was soooo P*SSED!    But I learned a valuable lesson!----The difference between a good haircut and a bad haircut is about three to four weeks growth time!  There was one good thing though!---LEAVING!

Their slogan is -- "You've got questions, we have answers!"  But their answers are mostly soooo lame!#@!#@!  Do they get these employees straight out of Jr. High Academy or what?...  Their clothes don't fit, their demeanor is shabby at best, and if they don't know something---right to the computer they go to see if they can find out what they don't have a clue about!  As a Radar Specialist for the FAA, electronics 101 is breakfast conversation to me and my peers.  So when I go up to an employee at Radio Shack and ask if they have a ferrite shunt for a telephone line (used to eliminate 60 hertz line noise [looks like a round carved dough-nut made of magnetized iron])  they give me this blank stare as if they were a dear caught in headlights of an oncoming vehicle...Truth is, this use to be a very common item on the store shelves to help get rid of line-noise, now everything is digital and works differently.  Oh well...As it turned out, I did an extensive search around the store to find they had no such device and ended up going to Fry's Electronics in Tempe, where I found what I was looking for....  I will say one good thing about this Radioshack or other Radio Shacks----They make for great ideas at Christmas time!  One Star!

The car was a Prius by Toyota...One of those electrical / mechanical hybrids that require a NASA Certification License to operate!  I left the car there to have it oil & lubed, then a wash.  I was told it would be about approximately an hour or so before it would be ready.  So off I went to do some errands in the vicinity.  When I got back, I found that the car wash left the door open and that the vehicle wouldn't start...To my surprise all power was dead and it didn't have the power to turn on a flashlight!  It took a friend of mine to arrive with a pair of jumper cables and some patience as we had to slowly re-charge the battery and for the electronics on board to realize the charge.  After about an extra hours delay, I was able to re-start the car and drive off.  The car wash waived its' charges, but I was still a bit torqued of the situation because of the incompetence of the staff about the new hybrid automobiles(they shouldn't accept vehicles they are unfamiliar with!). .----I give them two stars for cleaning my tires and for draining my batteries.

I would bring a date here!  The food is Cajun style with that New Orleans motif for decor.  The service was on point (good), and seating was more than adequate!  We asked for beads to darn on ourselves ---- and they brought us some!  The food is spicy as is Cajun style and the selections are terrific.  They serve alcohol and other libations...  The location is a bit outside of Phoenix Proper, but if you are looking for that Cajun effect---This is a good place to start.    As a bonus, they gave us a gift card for $5 off our next visit...This was a nice evening to say the least...I recommend it.  Four stars: One for decor, one for how the food tasted!  One for service, and one for price (reasonable).

What can you say about Panda Express Fast Food?----It's fast and that's it.  Nothing to get your palate all excited about or go out of your way for...It is just plain ol' sustenance at a glance.  Put your money down and they stuff you.  Now move it!  Pros about this franchise: It's fast!--- Cons about this franchise: It's fast!---  As they would say in older Taco Belch commercials----"Want Some?"

They always seem to have what I am looking for in Men's Colognes..Their prices are competitive and the staff helpful.  They even have sales that drive down the prices on some major colognes on occasion.  If th at doesn't top it off, I received $5.00 off of their low prices just by going to the Information Counter at Mall#1 and asking for the coupon booklet for the Arizona Mills Mall!  Don't miss out on some great buys!  They were even less in price for the same item I was out to buy, than the competitor down the mall from them. I give it five stars for price, location , parking galore, and overall appearance---(It's easy to find things on the shelves!)

We all should know by now that the Palace Station is not a Palace!   So I stayed here for the cheap room rate I was expecting-----   I saw on the Internet where you could stay for $28.00 for a night. What I didn't see was that in the upper right hand corner of the screen, there is an additional $14.99 tagged onto the room rate for some dumb*ss services that no one would more than likely use... Like free admission to the swimming pool! Notary service! (Notary!!!!) --- This is the Palace Station! People don't come here to do business, they come here to gamble, sleep, eat and limp around the joint...   So here I come thinking I'm paying $28.00 for a night---- "No Sir! If you read the screen closely, you would see where the $14.99 is mandatory and for all the benefits listed on that poster over there(pointed to advertising panel),.... Umph*! I guess I'm stuck paying with tax over $58.00 when it was all said and done...$#!@!%$#%#$#@!@  "NEVER AGAIN!" I told the woman behind the counter... as I checked in.... "Good Luck staying in business in this economy!"   I have Diamond level with Hilton, and I could have had a room with a full buffet breakfast for around $40.00 total during the week days... Soooo Pi*sed!   OK... So I was duped.... The room at the Palace were the Courtyard rooms, not the tower. The room is about the size of a standard Motel 6 but skankier looking and smelling a bit like urine...ewwe! The shower is short for tall people above say 5'8" . You'd need to stoop to get your hair wet. And the soaps are so thin and sad.  The towels----well, don't get too wet, or you might not have enough towel to dry yourself off with one towel....   To sum up this fiasco: For the money $58.00, most can more than likely stay in a more generous room elsewhere, and you might even get a decent breakfast with that!

Centrally located in Phoenix Proper.  This facility is easy to get to from Hwy 17 off of Bethany Home and is close to a hospital, just in case you have a 'thumper' while working on your strokes!----lol  It has 22 Lighted Courts, Locker Room Facilities, Tennis Shop, Tennis Professionals (for Hire), and Hitting Backboards.  To rent a court day or night, the costs are very reasonable...I use the backboards for free a lot to work out.    The courts are in good shape and well kept up, but I give it four stars because the Backboard Area is in need of resurfacing and repair.  They have stringing for your racket  (on site), and provide private tennis lessons for a fee.  There are Tournaments there frequently, and so for you venturing types, you might be able to connect in a little competition!

After reading about half a dozen reviews on this place, I had to try it out for their pancakes (especially their apple pancake with caramelized glazing....YUM!)  So what did I end up ordering?...The fluffy spinach omelet...lol  and on the side I got three buttermilk pancakes (comes with the order).   I passed the place two times because the sign is covered with some hedge bushes and it doesn't look very prominent overall (something that actually impressed me!).  They don't have to flaunt their business name, they just let their cooking and service do the advertising!  Luv it! The omelet was perfect, the pancakes were pancakes for buttermilk....The service on point!   Next time, I need to come here with a buddy so that we can share more of the menu...One person is NOT enough!   So why did I give it four stars instead of five?....Well, so that I had something more to look foreword too!  Can't wait to get back here...  PS....Someone needs to take a digital pic of this place!....So obscure!

Can this place make a sandwich or what!?!  I continue over and over again to bring friends to this place for lunch...Just to eat the bread!  The soup in a bread bowl is killer!  The bread used for sandwiches is killer!  The students that frequent the place for lunch is killer!  and the parking will kill you if you come at lunch...Very difficult to park there...so be prepared!  I give it a four out of five stars because of the parking situation , otherwise it would get a five star!

You say you want outstanding coffee close to downtown Phoenix?!  Do Ya!---Well let me tell you about this terrific little place called Lux Coffeebar....Just between Indian School and Camelback on Central... This place has what I would like to think the word 'Panache' was named after!  You walk through a very modest door into a world of peace.  Where the people sitting at their laptops (throughout), are the plumage of contentment.  Typing away at cyberworld, and sipping some of the BEST Coffee that is probably brewed in this part of the region of Phoenix!  The beans are roasted on-site, and the flavor of the latte' I had was beyond belief!  So was the texture!---Like silk!  WOW!  I was so bummed that I came during my work lunch-break and couldn't stay longer than 20 minutes or so for my first visit...Not the way I like to roll with such terrific coffee.  I like to chill out and take it all in...Oh well...I will be back! The setting is very comfortable for the lounger that wants to just sit and sip a cup of java and carouse the cyber connections out there.  There are cubby places to sit for all tastes, and the folks there filled most of them!  The motif is very earthy and the lighting is just right.  I gave it four stars instead of five because with such a gift as they have for making and serving some of the best in the industry, they need to have a larger sit-down area or areas to welcome and bless even more guests...+++

Zia covers my simple needs for finding Cd's in my era---late 60's through the 80's.  I never have to wait to get help, as there staff is all over the place, and the selection of Cd's is terrific!  You can bye new or used Cd's, what's your preference?  Location is easy to get to on University Blvd. and close to the happening Mill Rd district.  If you are looking for DVDs, they have that too and Off-The-Wall Music and Videos for the diversified varied taste.    I might give it five stars if they offered me a latte' as I was shopping....lol

Absolutely Fantabulous!!!!! The surrounding atmosphere, the place settings, the SERVICE! The quality of the food------Exceptional for the location and the ambiance. There was not one negative thing I can write about this place....Not one. If you want to have High-Class service and not think twice whether or not the food will be good-to-exceptional, and if you are semi-heavy in your last week's payroll check, then this is the place---hands-down! Want to impress a girlfriend a work colleague or a prospective client without busting the bank----THIS IS THE PLACE!!!! ...Sure, you might spend two to three hundred dollars for the two of you (depending on the wine selection or amount of mixed drinks you consume) but the memories will last a lifetime. This place, in my book is a HOME RUN all the way!!!!!!!!!!!!!....Bone-that's-petite

Yesssss!  it is definitely a Sports Lover's Place!  Loads of monitors to watch just about any game live, and the wings are exceptional!!  I like the Caribbean Jerk Sauce----Just the right tang, heat and flavor!----Oh man, does it make me want to take the trip from Highland and 17th to get there right now!---lol  I gave it four stars because the beer selection is mediocre...They don't even have Sierra Nevada Pale Ale on tap....*

The place is a dump! Poor service.... It took over ten minutes to get coffee and another five for the Non-Dairy Creamer.... (they have no cream!)   The food didn't make me ill, which was a plus, but it is nothing to write home about either.   I felt like I was doing myself a disfavor by even sitting there. The line to get into the buffet was long for a less-than-average selection and the restaurant didn't even have Keno, so that I could waste away slowly and possibly not tell that I was in decay....   Two stars because I didn't have to get my stomach pumped afterward.

It was very crowded for Father's Day!...but that is to be expected and is a positive showing for the business!!  As busy as it was, I was seated within 20 minutes and the service was prompt!...  I wanted to order eggs benedict but I have to confess that I used the photos and comments in YELP to show the waitress that some people complained that the eggs were overcooked...and I soooooooo wanted good-soft-and runny eggs in my benedict....she was right on top of it and it turned out PERFECT!...Yummmmmmmm.  The juice was fresh squeezed O.J. And the coffee was very tasty, not like it was overdone or old...  I give them four stars because there is no readily available bike rack outside....and this was my 1st time here on a holiday...so I need to wait until I come back and see if they are consistent.  PS...Great menu selections too!  Out.

I went to this location last night for dinner and let me tell you, for a Monday evening it rocks!  There were scores of people, large - large dining area (you can get lost in the booths or just sit somewhere out in the open...  The dish I ordered was Penne Pasta with Southwestern Chicken, sun dried tomatoes, garlic, a creamy white sauce that was just right (carbonara), and a good portion too boot!  The beer ---  I had a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale- On Tap!  Oh sooo good!  I give it four stars because the service was a little spotty...new hires being taught to serve, and the customer has to take the brunt of their inexperience...I was challenged for simple things like grated cheese for my pasta dish I had to ask for...and they brought the check before I was asked if there would be anything else I wanted---I actually wanted a coffee afterward!...Who'd-a-guessed!---lol   So I went to Starbuck's close to my apartment downtown....  Still, I would go there again.  A toast to all!

OK, here it is folks....I've been to this theater before and ran into the escalators being broken down and having to use the elevator(way too long a wait!---Not fun)  but the whole idea of the theater's location is a nice one, and yes, the movies seem to be a bit less macabre there and the maturity of the over-all crowd seems to have less crying children than many other theaters.  Last night though, I experienced the rank sewage smell (throughout the complex) with a friend (bad smells are the worst and most offensive to me!), theater #13 was filthy and unkempt, and the parking underground was a mess again! I'm sorry, but if I should decide to go on a date any time soon or to impress a friend, I might have to strongly reconsider my theater choices.  Possibly go to Fashion Square in Snottsdale (Oh well)--At least I know what to expect there!  To me and my friend, the smell was the worst!  Sorry, this theater gets only two stars.

Good Samaritan Trauma Center, Emergency 1111,East McDowell Road Phoenix----------------Unless you are truly dying and bleeding profusely, I would recommend not going to this hospital for general emergency care.  That is unless you don't mind waiting to see a doctor for up to 12 to 15 hours from the time you register into the Emergency Help Desk for your Flu or sprained ankle....  I am not a local here in Arizona, so whenever I need to get medical attention, I need to go to Emergency at any hospital for medical care (according to my current insurance policy).  So I scr*wed up and chose to go to this one at 3pm for Diarrhea I had over four days straight.  My stomach was aching, I had a fever, I was light-sensitive...  It was at 1am the next morning before I saw the Doctor-On-Duty....Why?  Because they take the most serious cases first ie: heart attacks, gun shot victims, etc.,,,  So I rated way low on their priority list...So did the 40 other people or so with me...So it was a long and gruesome wait in the Emergency Waiting Area.    Let's talk about the Emergency Waiting Area!  The decor---Looks like you need to be next to hopeless  to sit in any of their chairs---The chairs are worn out to pieces, sticky from the previous squatter's sweat and who knows what else, and not all the chairs are leather-like, but have cloth upholstery (meaning microscopic bugs and such can be easily transmitted onto your clothing!---Yuck!)  The floor is littered with semi empty bottles, dirty wrappers from candy and such, and left-over clothing articles and toys from previous patients waiting.....ewwe*    There are vending machines to grab your dollars as you wait, no complimentary coffee or tea, as I might see in other hospitals....There are water fountains to quench your need for processed public water!  The walls are plainly painted and old...Two 13 inch TVs on opposite ends of the waiting area so that you won't miss Dr. Phil or your favorite episode of COPS!...ac-hum*    Once you get past the golden arches of the waiting room doors into the inner-sanctum of the medical center, you are three quarters of the way to getting the H*ll out of there!  You see the doctor, he or she reviews your symptoms and then hopefully you are out within a couple hours after tests and a re-review from the doctor.... finally got out at 2am that next morning.  I give this Emergency Trauma Center one star for being there---That's it!----the best of health to ya!  PS....They take any major credit card you want to spend on!

Say!  My second five star for a review!....  OK...Here's the lowdown on this particular Mimi's at Avondale off the Dysart Exit on (HWY 10)---  Extremely easy to get to from the freeway going east or west bound.  it is on the north/west side of the freeway.  Me and a friend came for a quick lunch/dinner bite to eat after work...4:30 pm...The service was first rate, prompt, courteous, considerate of our timing needs IE: we needed time to talk and review the menu....The cleanliness was extremely clean!  The decor is Cajun in motif, and the over all layout is more than adequate for parties up to eight people....They may have a conference section..?(I didn't ask).  The prices are moderate, the place-settings spit / spot! and the atmosphere was welcoming.   I ordered the salmon with steamed veggies----Both were perfect!  Then afterwords I had the bread pudding in whiskey sauce!  Oh Man!  Again, perfect! But what impressed me the most---was the waiter's service and care to be considerate of our needs in timing, refills, our own space, and professionalism!  [if I were in a dump of an establishment, and received the service we received from this waiter, most places would probably get at least four stars!----lol]  I guess this means that the service actually means more than what goes into our mouth!  I'm looking for a genuine attitude of concern for our needs, more than the quality of the fare being served...Weird...I know....but true!   As it turned out though, the salmon was very well done.  Not dry or overcooked, and flavorful.  Parking is all around the restaurant and I felt completely safe, comfortable, at ease, and welcomed there.  Just watch the next person give this place two stars or worse...lol At this point though, I welcome anyone to---- 'Bone That's Petite' at this location.

There was only one thing on my mind for this night 10-12-2008 (STEAK!) My girl friend and me drove by this restaurant on our way to our hotel and we told each other to look it up on YELP to see if it had possibilities was rated high for 16 reviews, and it was close to our hotel so we decided to give it a go. The atmosphere was impressive, the service matched that of the atmosphere, and the food ---well this is where the turf meets the surf! ...   So why the two stars?? The wine selection. I asked the waiter for a selection of red wine to go with our meal (a pairing)...What we received was extremely disappointing, it just plain sucked! My girlfriend had ordered a fillet Mignon rare, and it came out almost well-done. They had reordered the steak for her and by the time it came out, my food was almost done and she was just beginning. The whole experience was a real disappointment overall and we will never consider coming back here again...there are just too many other fine dining establishments to choose from in Las Vegas to look back here a second time.  Two stars...one for the looks...one for the service...nothing for food or wine.  I think that that is the Meat of it! Bone-that's-petite!

This is a new wine, beer, and spirits store in the valley, though they have over fifty stores throughout the nation!    The wines are categorized by region, type, and in price.  The store even has a section where the store rep's have selected the highest rated wines for your consideration.  Each wine is well represented with a label in front of them explaining the type of wine, character and quality of the wine you are viewing.  When there is a rating given on the label, who rated the wine is also given..ie: Wine Enthusiast, Parker, etc.,,,    There are wine tastings for which you should call to get the details as to when.    This store also sells hard liquor, cigars, and beer of incredible variety!  It should not disappoint!  I was impressed with the selections of everything they carried.  It is like a Costco of booze!---lol      Pricings on wines range from inexpensive to "Where's your checkbook?!"  I saw a bottle of KRUG Champagne for $998.00 yet there were champagnes for as little as $7.00....bring your aspirin!    All in all, this place rocks!------AAA+++!!!----Salute!  and  Cheers!

Good location (on a corner), so easy to access.  The coffee is kept up and full day or night, simple grocery items and the fuel prices are competitive.  It is not a Full-Service Gas Station but they have Motor Oil and Radiator Fluid if your BMW or Jaguar is running low...lol  and sometimes the pumps are out of order, so I give it four stars.  Right around the corner from Duck and Decanter and a Starshmuck's.  Access to Hwy 51 is two blocks off in distance.

To the point----  One half hour ago, we left this restaurant with the intent to write our experience fresh off the brain!    My friend and me came for the steaks....we wanted meat of the Brazilian fare....What we got was a plate full of sodium and a $70.00 bill for two salads, one of which I never ate because I started straight out with the meat!  Carnivore Style!    My friend had a salad and I ate meat, meat, and more meat----all salty------%%$#@!$#@!    We asked for the manager immediately and told him about the extremely salty meat, the mash potatoes that were also high in salt, as was the lobster bisque soup too!     Instead of being concerned for our findings, he said "I will only charge you for two salads"   I told him I will only pay for one, as I only ate meat and it was all salty and extremely high in sodium....He said "two salads---That is final!"        I could continue with the tit-for-tat BS...But you get the picture....We paid with AMEX and hope to file a complaint with them for half the meal...    One very tiny star----as is all I can see giving them for the terrific water that was served us!     We should have done the Buffet at Bellagios!!!!

The location is pretty central to Phoenix, and it's a good resource when looking for that odd bottle of wine you won't find in Safeway's or Fry's Food Store!    I give it four stars because it is a bit pricy, but then...if you are trying to get that one bottle to impress!---Well, it hits the spot!  They have a terrific selection, a pleasant but small atmosphere to hide away for a time --- next to a glass of something and a good conversation with that special someone!  They sell wines by the glass, and a small selection of food menu items to pare with the wine.  The staff is very knowledgeable and can steer you right for just about any question on wines.  See you there!
