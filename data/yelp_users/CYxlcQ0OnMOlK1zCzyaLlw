The only reason I am giving 2 stars is because they have 5 star entertainment there. You get 10% off your tab for checking in on Yelp but they wont give it to you. The staff is rude. I had to convince secruity that I was going to the bar the to close my tab. The DJ came on at 1:20 and they kick everyone out of the bar at 1:30. I closed my tab finally and my discount was declined. I won't be back. I'll go see that band at a different, more customer friendly venue.
