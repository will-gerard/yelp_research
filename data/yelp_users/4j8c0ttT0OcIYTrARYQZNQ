Well lets see. I live in the far SW valley and Flo's Asian Kitchen is in the far NE valley. Everytime we go it cost us at least an extra $40 just in gas to get here, however it is well worth it. Been here at least 4 times, the last time we were in, they did not have the wonderful spring rolls. I hope its just a seasonal thing. The lettuce wraps are the best in the valley. I have tried a few other Flo's restaurant, and this one is the best. Very un-Scottsdale atmosphere. Big open room. Tables are some what close to each other, however the few times we have been there it has never been packed. They have the menu layed out by region. Very easy to understand. Their beer/wine list is limited,but what they do have is pretty good. Last time we were in they were featuring Mondavi.

I have must of been here on an "off" night. I was not impressed. The place is decorated like a Claim Jumper.  The service was good, however I was told the specials and the aged 28 day steak sounded good. When it came out there was so much pepper rub on the steak, I couldnt taste the meat. The pepper rub was so overpowering  that I couldnt eat but two bites. I let the server know my feelings about the steak and he said no problem we can just box it up for you. What?!?.  So anyway he proceeded to take it away and box it up. The real surprise is when I got the bill $78 dollars just for the steak!!! Last time I take the special without finding out the price. It was not worth the $78 dollars. Anyway, I pay the bill and chock it up to a lessoned learned

Two words, Classic Elegance   It is so nice to sit in a restaurant and have a fully trained staff wait on you. The staff is exceptional. I don't think any of their wait staff is under the age of 40. Which is great. I hate when we ask for a drink recommendation at other places and we hear "I don't know, I'm not old enough to drink, Or we hear, I don't know me and my friends usually just order shots".   The decor is hasn't changed since it opened 40+ years ago. There are no windows in this place and you enter from the back, though the kitchen. We have been here a few times and Durants has never disappointed. The complimentary relish tray is first to make it to our table. I think I can still taste the green onions on my breath. The calamari is some of the best we've had here in Phoenix. Very fresh. The salads are also some of the best we've had. We both had steak which was very good. We ordered a ton of food, however the pace at which they time the courses are perfect. Price is a bit steep we walked out dropping about $200. That included drinks, apps, entrees and desserts.

Lunch at Cibo is a 3 star, however dinner is wonderful(Close to a five star). There's not much to say that hasn't already been said. All their ingredients are imported from Italy. Perfect patio for Phoenix winter weather. Parking is horrible, however to have a great restaurant you have to have horrible parking. Definetly top 3 places in the valley to have pizza. Dessert is too die for.

This place is the epitome of GREAT customer service. Other restaurants should send their staff here for training, on how to treat customers.  We showed up at 7pm on a Thursday night. We knew there would probably be a wait. As we waited we saw the staff re-arrange tables so we wouldn't have to wait too long, Wow. As we were being seated the host noticed the table a little wobbly and fixed it right there on the spot, before we even got seated, another WOW!!. The food here is always good, we mostly have kisras when we come, however I thought I would venture out and try something new. I had the bleu cheese balsamic burger, which I hail it to be  as probably one of the best burgers I have had. The wife had her usual shrimp kisra, which is always good. Our glasses of water were always full, the staff is very attentive. So the kicker, we pay our bill and are already in our car leaving, when our server flags us down, we forgot our leftover boxes at the table, WOW, WOW!!!! I am infamous for forgetting our boxes at restaurants,  this is the first time a server made an attempt to  make sure I didn't forget them. I will definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a PERFECT experience in dining. Thank you FEZ!

I think these rave reviews are from people who have never made a homemade cupcake. I was in there about two weeks ago thinking I was going to have an out of body experience when I tasted these cupcakes. I purchased one of every flavor and then drove 32 miles home so my wife and I could endulge. We were both very un impressed. The icing tasted just like Betty Crocker store bought icing and the same with the cake.  Of all the ones I tried the lemon did have a good flavor but nothing to write home about.   I dont do too many reviews. I only review on places that blow my socks off and places that just blow. Lets just say this place did not blow my socks off.

This has to be the most honest and reliable shop around. I live in the southwest valley and drive all the way here, just to get my car serviced. I had the dealer try to charge me $1200 for a new computer system in my car, I brought it to this place and he was able to troubleshoot the problem to a loose wire. He didn't even charge me to fix it. Since then I have brought my car to this place and would recommend this shop to anyone who is looking for an honest mechanic.  So far I have had to replace a hose for power steering. They also was able to find the replacement part cheaper than I could get anywhere else. The only down side is they dont have a fancy lobby if you have to wait for your car. I would recommend someone picking you up.

Wow, I usually dont write reviews, I just read up to see where is a good place to eat. This place is amazing and definetly needing more positive reviews.  Tucked away in a corner of a strip mall this place has amazing southern food. The fried green tomatoes were perfectly seasoned and delicious. My wife had fried chicken, which was very juicy and the batter was perfect. I had the pork chop which was not just one pork chop, but TWO huge porkchops smothered in gravy.  The fried okra is the way okra is supposed to taste crunchy and yummy. Usually I had to settle for Cracker Barrel for okra(which wasnt that great), but now I know where to go for comfort food.  The menu has a big variety not just fried food. They had baked spaghetti, po' boys, chicken, pork.  The dessert's are all made from scratch, we had the peach cobbler and it was to die for.

North is one of our favorite restaurants. The Zucca chips are the best. I have never tried anything that even come close to the yummieness of these. They are flash fried zucchini, shaved razor thin. You can eat a whole bowl and not get full. The wine here is always good. The risotto is really close to "moms".  We have always have gotten really lucky and received a secluded table in the back, they are more romantic.  The dessert is pretty standard, not bad, just not spectacular.

It is so hard to find good southern food in this town. So far I have had the shrimp etoufee and and shrimp po'boys. There is nothing fancy about this place, however the food is amazing. Located in of course, a strip mall, next to LA Fitness. Somewhat hard to see, but definetly worth checking out. The prices are great too. Everything is under $10. Their menu has catfish, shrimp, chicken and a few other things. This is just a mom & pop little place which is awesome. I hope this place sticks around.

This place is really good. They use premium Blue Bell Ice Cream and their ice is like eating a cloud. They serve ice cream. Hawaiian style snow cones.  Ton of different flavors to choose from. They had my favorite, Tigers Blood. You can add sweet cream to the top. Very inexpensive. My family of 4 all got treats and the total was under $10.
