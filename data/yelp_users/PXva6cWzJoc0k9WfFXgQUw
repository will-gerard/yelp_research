Good air flow on the floor. Doesn't feel super smokey like most other casinos in the area. Smaller too and like other casinos, can get crowded on Saturday nights. Played BAD Bingo and had a blast with my family for my 30th birthday - didn't win but still had tons of fun!

We are what you would call regulars here... Or were, I suppose. We went several times a month and with the exception of a very few select servers, we were never remembered...  We have had several experiences that left us saying, 'we'll never come back,' but I think tonight did us in... We waited over 10 minutes and were never acknowledged by a server.  If you take a chance and decide to go here, don't expect great service unless you get one of the good servers who will probably not be there the next week, you'll probably think the food is way over priced and the atmosphere is hit or miss.  Can someone please call restaurant impossible and save this place!!???

Sorry they didn't have red velvet, I was looking forward to it. Nonetheless, the vanilla was excellent and they had some very clever toppings like animal cookies and nerds! Loved it!
