I never thought I wouldn't be giving a 5 star rating, we've dined here before and we were very impressed. I made reservations on open table about a month ago and 15 minutes before we were to be at dinner I accidentally cancelled our reservation, I immediately called BRAND and let them know of the mistake I made but I kept getting their after hours center even though they were open so my husband and I decided just to go down early and speak with them. Once explaining what I had accidentally done the hostess wasn't going to allow us to eat there because they were "fully booked" luckily the Manager was there and allowed us to keep our reservation. We waited a while for our waiter to come by they finally brought us water and in about 15 minutes we were able to place our wine order. It was clear to us at this time because we had accidentally cancelled the reservation (15 minutes prior) that we weren't going to receive the same level of service as the others dining near us. I hadn't been feeling well and it took a while to place our order and get our appetizer (hot rocks which was very good). About an hour into dinner I decided I would rather go up to our room because I wasn't feeling well. My husband asked them to pack up our dinner which they did however once we got it up to our room we realized they didn't give us any utensils we then had to order room service   to get utensils because I still wasn't able to get anyone on the phone at the actual restaurant. After spending 200 on dinner and then another 20 to get utensils my husband and I unfortunately will not be dining at BRAND again. I was very excited to dine here because of how awesome our first experience was but this was just horrible to wait that long for drinks and dinner and to clearly see open tables throughout the restaurant, just not acceptable.
