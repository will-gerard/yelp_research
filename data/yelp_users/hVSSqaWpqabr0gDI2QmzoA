Worst customer service! But they don't care! I even spoke to a manager and he would not exchange my defective device.  What happen to taking care of your customer?

I'm Apple happy again thanks to a senior advisor named Eric. After expressing my problem and frustration with him he quickly resolved my issue and sent me a new iPad Air.

We ate here for a friends birthday and we showed up just before closing and they did not once ever push us to leave because they are closed.  Even our food came out perfect!  The server we had Lorenzo Garcia was nice, funny and always made sure we had everything we wanted!  I love Outback and we do eat here very often but this experience on this day was outstanding and something that should be told to all!  Thank you for a great birthday celebration!

This place is the BEST!  The store is clean, restrooms are nice and most of all the staff is awesome!  They treat you like family and when you walk in you are  greeted with a smile. I used to buy my tires at the "other" place but never again!  This is your one stop shop for all your car care needs!

I feel the need to update my review I recently had my oil changed and when I came home the next day oil was leaking all over my driveway. Unfortunately it was on a Friday and they are closed Saturday and Sunday. I went first thing Monday morning and after waiting an hour I was told they had to order a part and I would need to come back but he assured me it would only take five minutes. 30 minutes later I had to tell him to bring my car down I had to be somewhere and I could not be a minute late.  He said if I could come back later and I had to say yes I needed my car fixed. So I waited again and finally I had to go out to the bay and tell them I need to go NOW! Honestly I don't even know if they fixed it because I had to hurry. Needless to say I was late and I got fined for picking up my daughter late and I have a oil stained garage.

We came in 2 minutes before closing and they helped us with a smile!  They didn't even try and kick us out after 40 minutes. Good was great, fast and fresh. Would come here again because they where so nice to still serve us.

Jason Smith Fitness is the BEST!  I have tried every program out there and Jason's was the only one that gave me results!  He is very caring, patient and truly wants to help you succeed in your fitness goals.  I wish I never stopped and honestly I need to go back!  Jason Smith Fitness has a very clean facility, the equipment he has from the fitness balls to the different workout machines are all well maintained. The other thing I really liked about them is they did not care or judge if you where 100 lbs or 300 lbs.  They didn't look at you any different and helped you with your goal no matter what size your where.  They really treat you like family and I would HIGHLY recommend his place if you are looking for a program that will give you results.

My husband and I like to try coffee shops on Sunday's and today we picked Lola's.  I think we found our spot!  The food is amazing and they don't skimp on the portions.  I would recommend this place!

First time here and it was very good!  The many different salsas at the salsa bar are very good.  My husband had their version of a "torta" I would recommend sticking with the tacos. The steak and white fish tacos are amazing!    Only bad thing is it not very big and tables are close to each other.  Service was slow but the food made up for that. I would definitely return!

Randy's Vision has been my photographer many years and his attention to the detail of the photo is outstanding!   I have used his services for individual photos, family/group photo's as well as for special events.  He always is ready to do the job, coming prepared and makes every time a everlasting memory!  If you are looking for a photographer I would highly recommend his company!  Thank you for all you have done for us!

Best place ever! Very nice people and they go above and beyond when doing the service requested. Pedicures are my favorite.

Very very good!  I always get the king crap legs and I have never had a complaint.  Corn bread is good, vegetables and pretty much anything.
