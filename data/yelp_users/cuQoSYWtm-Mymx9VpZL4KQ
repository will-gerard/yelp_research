This is my usual nail salon and I have always been pleased with their work. I am glad they have expanded and the new glitters they have gotten for gel manicures are awesome!

I went here for lunch and ordered a Thai iced tea and the Duck salad. The duck was cooked rare and the salad was extremely spicy, contrary to the server's remarks. I ended up having to leave mid meal and throw up. It was and extremely unpleasant experience. I was so sick that I didn't even have a chance to speak up.

I decided to go here after having my first eyelashes done elsewhere. Masha used mink eyelashes after removing the silk eyelashes carefully yet quickly. These lashes provided much more volume with half the weight. The beds are super cozy and the eye pads she used to keep my bottom lashes down were much more comfortable than the previous place I went to. I'm so happy to have found this lovely lash boutique!

I heard about Urias through my neighbor, whose yard has always looked nice. They gave me a reasonable quote for the jungle I had growing in my back yard and also for monthly maintenance. They showed up on time and Jessie, the owner ( husband and wife team) always made sure to contact me in regards to any changes. They even suggested which herbicide to buy at Home Depot bc it would be cheaper for me to do it then for them to provide it. I appreciated that bc they could have easily marked it up without my knowledge. My yard looked completely transformed after a 5 man crew worked on it for 5+ hrs. They trimmed all the trees and cleaned everything up. No leaf in sight after they were finished. They did everything they stated they would during the consult plus more. They even told me what is included in the maintenance and what is extra. They come to my neighborhood on a certain day and I don't mind that bc I don't have to be home when it happens. Only thing is I wish they had online payment or a recurring payment for the maintenance but that is no big deal.

I went here for a perm recently bc of all the great reviews. I brought in a picture and the stylist said she could achieve the results using a spiral perm. I later found out from another more high end salon I normally go to that these results can only be done with a curling iron. I also was told on the phone they could do a single process color in one visit and when I arrived they said I had to come back in one week. Anyway, the perm completely damaged my hair bc they processed for an hour, instead of the usual 5-20 min processing time. I found this out after having to go to another salon to fix the results and get the Demi color done. The curl that I achieved looked nothing liked the picture and the stylist acted the everything was perfect and quickly rushed me out of the salon. I am going back to speak with the manager to tell them about the damage they did to the front of my hair. They obviously did not have the expertise to achieve the results I wanted or to recognize that the picture I brought in was not a spiral perm. The stylist also did not even know what rods to use and had to keep asking other stylists. I should have left at this point but I didn't want to be rude. My mistake in trusting them with my hair.

I am giving this spa two stars, not one bc the quality of the treatment has always been good. However, the scheduling itself has been a huge disappointment. I use Yelp quite a bit and appreciate the fact that I can use the app to book appointments. However, they only allow scheduling on the hour and you have to call to book an appointment on the half hour. Okay, no big deal. So I call and make a same day appointment for a hydra facial and a massage. As I'm on my way to the spa, the front desk girl calls me and apologizes that there has been a mixup and they can no longer accommodate my appointments at that time. She offers to put a note in my file and promised that next time I come in, " they will do something super nice for me." A week later I decide to try booking the hydra facial this time through Yelp. I receive my confirmation email and I head in. When I get there they have no record of my appointment ever being made. I show them my confirmation email and luckily they were able to still get me in during that time. This is now the second time that something has happened to my booking. They also could not locate in my file that anything was noted from last time. The owner said that she will do something nice for me but instead of saying she will look into her Yelp booking problems, she advises me to not use them instead! I reminded her that the first booking problem was solely a staff issue and not associated with Yelp. I have booked many appointments with Yelp and have never had a problem until now. So I finish my hydra facial and the aesthetician also tries to push $140 worth of products on me and just assumed I was going to buy all of them in addition to my $225 hydra facial. They did discount my facial to $150. Thinking that was their attempt at making up for the two mistakes, I found out that the discount is actually given to all first time hydrafacial bookings. So what happened to the two promises that " something super nice will be done?" Apparently the front desk girl and the owner both had long forgotten about that after my one hour appointment. In hindsight I probably should've not given in to sales pressure and left the products and also spoke up more regarding the booking mistakes but I'm just not the type of person that likes to voice my concerns in front of a full lobby of clientele waiting to enjoy their spa visit. I do however realize that this is worth mentioning on Yelp in hopes that they will improve their booking processes. Who wants to look forward to a spa day, only to find out 10 min before your appointment that too bad, bc the customer before you decided to upgrade their hydrafacial, now you either can't have one that day or I need to cancel other arrangements to relax. I think the aesthetician needs to check her bookings before upselling her current client's facial. I really wanted to like this spa enough to purchase a membership bc I'm a frequent spa goer do to my high stress profession, but it didn't seem like the owner and her staff really wanted to make up for their mistakes.  UPDATE:  The owner did call me in attempt to make this right again and offered to give me a free spa service on my next visit. She also left me her personal number to make sure my concerns were addressed. I really appreciate her willingness to make her business better and will try them again bc the services have always been wonderful.

I have been here twice. The first time I received a gel manicure from John. The service was fine and there were lots of color choices. However, when we were speaking John stated that he disliked his job " but does it anyway." Not sure why you would tell a customer something like that. I decided to give them another try. This time I received a pedicure and gel polish change. The nail technician who did my pedicure did not ask me what kind of pedicure I wanted and gave me the most basic one they had. Having worked a ten hour shift running around on my feet, I had hoped for an upgraded spa pedicure. She also spent the majority of the time speaking with her coworker in a foreign language and did not pay much attention to her task at hand. Next, the same tech I had on the last visit did my polish change. They did have a great selection of colors but the polish ended up bubbly and uneven. He also cut my nails when I had only asked for a polish change and made my nail bleed. The massage pads set on the pedicure area are uncomfortable and cannot truly be turned off or removed. I had high hopes for this salon due to the reviews and pricing but I don't think I will be returning.

I came here to get a volume fill after having my lashes done at another company for a few months. The beds were very comfortable and Jessica was very informative and skilled. I received info on general care and maintenance that I had not received elsewhere. I had no idea that my lashes should have lasted much longer than I had previously experienced. My fill also looked much more full than before. The price was also $25 less than I had been paying. I really liked the nano-mister and the little fan they used. Instead of waiting the 2 days, it was only a 4 hr downtime before my lashes could get wet. The eye pads were also more comfortable and less irritating to my eyes during the fill. In the past, I had experienced stinging from wet glue as well. Not this time. I think I have found my new lash extension home!
