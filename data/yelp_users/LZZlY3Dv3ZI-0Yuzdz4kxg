five stars are not enough to say enough good things about this company!!! I was worked into his already booked schedule and he went above and beyond to get my wifes Iphone 5C fixed before we left on vacation. As well as the prices are cheaper than anywhere I have checked on. But the most important part besides the superior parts and care he takes to repair the phone is the extreme high level of customer service he provides. I highly recommend ifixem to anyone looking to get a mobile device repaired.

This food is like no other! It has so much flavor your mouth know what to do! The bbq ribs are so tender they fall off the bone and the bbq sauce is out of the world. To top it all of there corn bread cake is the most heavenly thing to finish off your meal. I will recommend this place to everyone not only for there amazing food but there customer service makes you feel like you are part of the family!
