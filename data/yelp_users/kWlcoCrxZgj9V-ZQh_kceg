Always great food and great service. The Prickly Pear sandwich is a classic. I recommend the chicken wings and pizza. The restaurant has a cozy feel and it's great to patronize a locally owned establishment.

***Updated 3/9/16 I received calls from the owner and manager to apologize for our experience. They were very kind and wanted to make it right. If they care this much about what one person says I am sure what happened was not a common occurrence. We will indeed be back.***  I must say that I really enjoyed the food, it was cooked to perfection. My wife and I celebrated our anniversary there on 3/2/16. My only gripe is that it didn't feel special. Our waiter did not speak much to us and didn't offer any recommendations and once he knew we were not ordering alcohol, it was hard to get another drink option. It felt like we were a burden. Having said that I am glad we went to such a historic location. Not sure if we will be back, other Stake Houses have treated us much better. I still tipped over 20% because there are other staff that were more pleasant and wanted to be sure they were taken care of.

Great Sandwiches, I love their baguettes and croissants. Try their fresh squeezed lemonade, it doesn't disappoint. Just remember they are cash only.

We took our daughter here for her first haircut. They did a great job and they really work well with kids. The salon is really designed nicely and kid friendly, we will be back for sure.

Love this place, great pizza and huge slices. Every time I go I get the lunch special with wings. Try their special wing sauce, it's tasty. Service is good and fast and always friendly. Once when our group was leaving and they had an extra pizza and sent it with us, no charge. We will be coming back time and again.

I was hoping this place would be better. I ate breakfast there with my family and it was not the best. With such a small breakfast menu, one would think it would be served rather quickly even if its made to order. Take biscuits and gravy for example. That is a fast dish to prepare, but it still took all too long to make it to the table. The Sunshine on a cloud, was anything but. It was dry and the yolk was overcooked and far from over easy. The muffins were great and very fresh, we would definitely return for those, but we will wait a while before trying breakfast meals again.

The pizza, wings and garlic knots are great. There seemed to be some confusion about our order, but overall a good place. Ordering for pick up might be best. I will be back for sure.
