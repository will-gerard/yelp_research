Easily my favorite camera store in the Phoenix area.   They've got a wide selection from compact digitals all the way up to large format view cameras, along with everything you need for your darkroom, and a wide selection of film and paper. Being directly off the freeway also means they can often be faster to get to than other camera stores.  Prices are competitive and the staff is very knowledgeable, friendly, and patient. Whether you're a first-time buyer or a seasoned professional, they can answer your questions and get you what you need. They're also very cognizant of wait times, with staff dropping what they're doing to get you helped or checked out.  The rentals desk is well-inventoried and the rentals staff are friendly, making it easy to get what you need, often even on short notice. Low equipment deposits also make it easier to get what you need, as you're  required to front only 33%, rather than 50% or even 100% of the replacement cost.  If you need a camera bag, Photomark has the best selection I'm aware of in the Phoenix area. All the major manufacturers are represented, and there are far more models available than at other camera stores.  There are a couple things that tend to scare new customers off unnecessarily. First, it's in an older (not "bad") part of town, which tends to freak out suburbanites used to newer construction, fewer minorities and homeless (and homeless minorities), and more standard traffic flow. I've never had a problem, nor has anyone I know. You should lock your car, but you don't need to brandish a Taser or wear Kevlar.  Second, the parking lot is small. Especially if you don't realize Photomark owns the entire center, it seems like there's far too little parking--but they own all three businesses and you're free to park anywhere in the plaza. Still, it's best to avoid going around midday, as it can be difficult to park during the lunch hour rush. It may also be ideal to take a smaller vehicle if you're not intimately comfortable with where your sides and rear and are.  The biggest downside to shopping at Photomark is that unlike Tempe Camera, they don't break down pro packs of film--if they don't stock or the manufacturers don't make a given film in single-roll packages, you're stuck buying an entire pro pack.

Love. If you need pretense and high prices with your Mexican food, Juan's will completely disappoint. If, on the other hand, you're looking for a fast, tasty meal with super friendly service, you've found your place. And dirty cheap, at that.   Better yet, if you can't find what you want on the combo menu, you're just too damn picky. I have never been to another Mexican restaurant with so many combo plate options--whatever you want, you'll eventually find it on the list.   Helpful tip: Drinks, weirdly, come in sizes even for dine-in. The "medium" is pretty much a bucket, so save your dinero and don't go any larger.

As a native, I really never appreciated how friendly "America's Friendliest Airport" was. And then I flew to Kentucky. (Southern Hospitality my ass.) And Chicago. Let's just say I returned home with an entirely new appreciation of our TSA screeners, our free WiFi, our airport employees, our gate agents, our shuttle drivers, our variety of food, and about a million other things.  Also: CHOO CHOO! SKYTRAIN EXPRESS, MOTHERLOVERS! The SkyTrain is powered by black, time-defying magic, and I can only hope they keep it as amazingly efficient when it gets extended to Terminals 2 and 3. Drop my bags off and materialize at the security checkpoint two minutes later? Hell. Yes. The only missing link in the SkyTrain is the ability to have your bags meet you at the parking garage when you return to Phoenix, but I understand that would be a logistical nightmare.  Terminal 4 is clearly the crown jewel, but they've done a decent job upgrading 2 and 3 over the years.

These guys ARE great. When you've got anything in mind for your 4x4 that goes above and beyond how it rolled off the factory floor, they've got the parts, the experience, and the know-how to get you squared away. Good selection of accessories and upgrades, and there's enough combined knowledge in store to choke a horse.  Labor rates are extremely fair. They can do anything from install a lift to repair a frame.   There are about a million chain and local "off-road shops" in the valley, but 4Wheelers is the only one that's earned my trust.

The food's good, the beer's usually good, the brewmaster's awesome. If I could rate a restaurant just on those criteria, it would easily be a 4-star joint.  But this Rock Bottom location has a chronic, nagging problem: The service.  Several years ago they were great--waitstaff was on their game, management was always around to check on things and even work the floor. Since that time, the awesome management has been promoted up into corporate and the service really hasn't been the same. A 30 minute lunch turns into an hour, drinks remain empty, the bill sits on the table while you try in vain to get your waiter to pick it up.   Occasionally Rock Bottom teases me with a great service, but then it just lets me down with another trip to slowsville on the next visit. Good eats if you've got the time, but don't go expecting a quick meal.

Don't let the fancy fa√ßade fool you: This is the saddest, dingiest, most disappointing Goodwill I have ever visited.  Ever spot a cute guy or girl from across the room, then you get up close and they've got a unibrow, halitosis, and aren't actually wearing pants? This is that Goodwill.

Loved Atomic Comics before they moved to this location, hated them not long afterward.  Everything that made them great--personable service, a wide selection of local comics, employees who weren't socially inept--flew out the window with the larger, brighter store. Oh, right, and then there was that whole "knowingly selling illegal copies of DVDs" thing.

You haven't had pizza until you've had NYPD. Mmm. The perfect crispy-on-the-outside, chewy-on-the-inside crust, neat and tasty pizzas, and a good selection of greasy spoon Italian fare.  The only item I'd really avoid is the eggplant parmesan; it tends to comes out overcooked and dripping grease.  Shame they killed off the shrimp pizza (shrimp, white sauce, cheese), but that's life. The Mott Street Meat Lover still gets my vote with those big delicious meatball slices on it. Mmmm. Not that any of the pizzas are bad, really, just that the Mott Street is so good.  If you've got a large group,  take out's your best option--the dining area's a little on the cramped side and won't accommodate groups larger than around 8 people very well. The dining room is also almost always busy, so the wait for enough tables to open up for a large group may be a long one.

As I eat my way through the menu, my opinion of NYPD has not changed.  The sandwiches are good. The calzones are also tasty (but heavy on the ricotta, which I know some people don't like). Baked ziti is still as delicious as ever. And they make a mean caesar dressing. Yum!  NYPD has also added and expanded delivery since my last review. There's a fairly large minimum order for it to be free, but if you're lazy then you probably don't care.

Cheap, cheap, cheap. And I don't mean that in a bad way.  Red Dragon is one of those great little hole in the wall Chinese places, but with uncommonly low lunch prices and better taste than most. Dinner prices are about average. Their soups are always steaming hot, their entrees tend to be cooked just right, and their rice is the perfect combination of sticky and fluffy.  They can take a little longer than some other restaurants to have your order ready, but the result is worth the wait. Red Dragon also claims not to use MSG, which may be a point in their favor for some diners.  It's not fine dining Chinese and doesn't pretend to be, but they're definitely toward the top of the heap for fast, tasty Asian comfort food.

First Regional would not be my first choice for emergency or regular animal care. They're not entirely horrible, but I've experienced so much better at other offices.  The front desk staff seem to hate their jobs while the vet techs and the vets are reasonably friendly. If you're in for an appointment, they tend to run considerably behind schedule. On the up side, they have a nice saltwater tank you can stare at during your long waits.  I was rather put off when I took an ill cat in for an appointment and the vet's first suggestion was to put her down. No bloodwork, no exam, just a few broad symptoms, and she's already hopping on the express train to Euthenasiatown. Her explanation was that it could end up being expensive to treat the cat. (It ended up under $200, and said kitty is now very happily living with me. OH GOD SO EXPENSIVE, WHY DID I LET YOU LIVE?) That one left me rather aghast.  And part of the treatment was a product their office just so happened to sell. Turned out I could have bought it at Petsmart for considerably less money.  It's also worth noting First Regional has a _very_ limited capacity for "exotics" (which is, in their definition, anything that's not a cat or dog). If you need emergency care in the East Valley, it's pretty much VCA ARECA or bust for animals like ferrets and birds. First Regional will not see ferrets at all, and other critters are a crapshoot.

I didn't know there were any car washes not using filtered water left in Phoenix, but apparently Full Circle's one of them. While even coin-op washes boast "spot-free filtered water!", I had to break out the quick detailer spray and a microfiber as soon as I got home from Full Circle--water spots galore!  This was after the attendant had done my towel dry, mind you, and wiped down most of the water but left my mirrors soapy. And picked the remnants of the receipt out of my windshield cowl, because the other attendant helpfully left it tucked under the wiper blade when he sent me through.  Sure, for 4 bucks I didn't have to get sweaty in the humid summer air (well, at least not until I came home and had to clean up their mess)... but  I don't think it's unreasonable to think "Exterior Wash" shouldn't be synonymous with "Careless Wash."

Los Favoritos is one of mis favoritos.  It's not gourmet, it doesn't pretend to be, and for that you must love it. It's cheap, fast Mexican food. In some of the best tortillas I've ever had anywhere. I'd buy the tortillas and eat them warm all by themselves.  For me, Los Favs is a breakfast haunt. They make a killer breakfast burrito with your choice of chorizo, ham, sausage, bacon, or some combination thereof. Add to that scrambled eggs, potatoes, cheddar cheese, and I'm pretty sure butter. It will clog your arteries and shave years off your life, but dammit, it's a hell of a breakfast.  Pro Tip: It's half of Chandler's breakfast haunt, too, so come prepared to stand around for a while in the mornings.  They crank out the burritos in turbo, but they've only got two (usually one) registers and so many employees.  They're also open late if you've got an evening craving for some Mexican.

Same day? No way. Next day? Keep dreaming.  No matter when you go, they always have some excuse why they can't get the garments turned around in the times they advertise. And worse, they don't bother telling you this until they've already taken your garments and handed you a ticket, apparently hoping you won't notice your expectation of Monday turned into Wednesday or Thursday.  Look elsewhere unless you've got time to kill for only minor savings.

Comfort food at some of its best. Portions are huge for the price you're paying, and the calzones are absolutely monstrous. If you can actually eat a whole calzone by yourself, you're a hungrier man than I.  There isn't a whole lot of seating, so consider takeout if you're in a hurry to eat or need to feed a particularly large group.

Chandler has no shortage of good and cheap Chinese food, but I'm reluctant to count Yangtse Chinese Bistro among it.  They're cheap, I'll give them that. And it's authentic, staffed by actual Chinese people, with a menu in broken English.  The actual quality of the food is variable, but leaning decidedly toward the crappy side. Overcooked is the order of the day, from stir-fry to grilled to deep-fried. Dishes that are flavorful and delicious at other Chinese joints are often bland and lifeless or, worse, just plain overbearing.   On a good day, Yangtse pumps out passable, cheap Chinese. But those days are few and far between. In the same shopping center, the Chinese joint inside Basha's turns out much better Chinese for about the same money--and it's staffed by Mexican immigrants. I don't know about anyone else, but I'll take good food cooked by someone of the "wrong" heritage over bad food cooked by someone of the "right" heritage.

Bolstered by Nicole T's review, we decided to give Yangtse a rare third shot.  Oops.  The rice was still overcooked and gummy, the chicken was still overcooked and dry, the breaded dishes were still over-fried, the beef was still flavorless. And those of us who partook became what I will charitably describe as "ill."  So, hey, we did get something new out of trying it again--nausea and intestinal distress!  Three strikes, it's out, even in spite of good crab puffs and the free fried (empty) wontons with their cute little smiley face stamp on the bag.

Work keeps me on the road, and it took experiencing a lot of Starbuckses to appreciate just how awesome my local one is. This location has great staff, plenty of tables, and just the right vibe. Like Calie mentioned in her review, even the other patrons are great.  I can get a consistent cup of coffee at any location, but if I'm not running out the door with my joe, this is the Starbucks I want to be at.

My fondest memories of this building are when it was Eegee's. It was at least useful years later as an AlphaGraphics.  Guns Etc is... a gun store. Ostensibly, anyway. Most of the time the staff are doing their best not to sell anything, which is baffling for a store with a substantial inventory. Even on the rare day the staff aren't actively ignoring or driving off customers, the inflated prices take care of it.  Once you walk out of Guns Etc in disappointment/disgust, you can at least walk across the parking lot and comfort yourself with some decent New York Chinese at Red Dragon or some tasty Filipino fare at Jeepney Bistro.

This was the most badass Apple Store in the universe back when Apple stock wasn't worth $300 a share and a bevy of retail consultants hadn't convinced them to turn it into an Abercrombie-esque store-cum-gay-dance-club. (Latin cum, not slang cum.)  A&F can get away with it because they sell two pieces of cloth sewn together. The Apple Store sells computers. And more importantly, the Apple Store repairs computers. When you can't talk to an employee about your repair/purchase without shouting over the music, your computer retail location has failed to meet its purpose.  Couple that with the usual crowds that come with being Chandler Fashion Center and it's a disaster. Right at open's fine, right before close is fine; in between, abandon hope all ye he who enter here.  It seriously took me an hour to buy a computer last time, even after giving up and waving my AmEx in the air like I just don't care. On the bright side, the Apple Store employees aren't total jerkbags, so it's still better than ReMac/iStore/whatever the hell they're masquerading as these days.

While it ain't what it was back when the concept of an Apple Store was new and novel, I can't knock the Chandler location too hard. Apple's done a lot of improvements across retail, and this store specifically has seen major improvements in staffing and speed. Also music volume.   I still wouldn't want to be here on a Saturday or Sunday (Don't do it! Step away from the mall!) except with a pickup confirmation in hand, but every recent trip has been relatively painless. In-store pickup is amazing, especially if you've got an iPhone and the Apple Store app. (Seriously, if you have an iPhone and aren't using the Apple Store app for purchases you don't need help with, you're crazy. It doesn't get easier than "Amanda has your iWhatever" and Amanda standing at the entrance because the app told her you were just about there.)  Outside of peak hours, any number of helpful and friendly employees are right there to help out, and there are enough systems that you can play with whatever you want in short order if not immediately. Their level of product knowledge is all over the place but if you have specific concerns they will try to find someone who can knowledgeably answer them.  Getting a Genius Bar appointment is still a blood sport, but there have been major improvements in the in-store experience once you actually have that appointment. Heck, the last couple times I've had an appointment, they've actually helped me early. That's a miraculous turnaround from standing around grinding against your MacBook for an hour past your supposed appointment time. I'll take it!

This Panda Express location is a difficult one to review.  As is typical of the Panda, the food's good and cooked up fast. No, it's not gourmet Chinese, but it's tasty enough.  But then we come to the weakness of this location: The menu.  The selection is really, really slim. To the point they don't even have sweet and sour chicken, for crying out loud. I'm used to Panda Express locations varying in their options (Potato Chicken and String-Bean Chicken are always hard to come by), but this one really takes the cake as far as limited selection goes.

Abuelo's doesn't make bad food.  Abuelo's also doesn't make good Mexican food.  If you're looking for toned down versions of Mexican fare with the occasional winner, then their menu may delight you. But it's also for the most part very forgettable. You'll walk away feeling satiated and maybe even like you got your money's worth, but there's no afterglow of delicious Mexican goodness.  The glitz, the glam, and the consistently good service can't make up for the fact most of the food is just bland as hell. As someone else mentioned, it's not lack of quality ingredients; the produce is fresh, the cuts of meat are decent, and it's cooked well. There's just no flavor, much less any spice. Guy likened it to an upscale Del Taco--that's unfair to Del Taco; they at least have the balls to serve food with taste.  What's more disappointing is they weren't nearly as bad several years ago when they opened. There was still better Mexican in the Valley, but I could leave Abuelo's without feeling like I ordered a Bland Platter.

Yow! Has it really 4 years since I wrote Abuelo's off as disappointingly bland? I have to remedy that. Along the way, they've found their footing again. On top of that, there have been several menu changes for the better. Whether you want mild or a kick in the mouth, they've got you covered. The menu's expanded to the point it even includes some less-common dishes you'd be hard-pressed to find elsewhere.   And oh my God, you guys, the carnitas, oh my God. They originally introduced it as a weekend special--basic carnitas tacos--and it's since colonized a half-dozen entrees. EAT IT.  Service has been impeccable without fail.

Sur La Table is my guilty pleasure.  If the kitchen is my laboratory, Sur La Table is my ACME Catalog. They've always got something cool and new to check out, the prices are reasonable, and the staff is great.  Not only are the employees friendly, but more often than not they've got great suggestions on things to check out or how to make the most of what you're buying. In a world where most retail lackeys are sacks of flesh paid to punch buttons, it's refreshing.   The store's not huge, so they may not have your current object of desire. They're more than happy to order it, though.

I've had good experience with Delia's Cleaners in general, but this location is just fantastic.  The employees are friendly and know what they're doing, the store is spotless, and it doesn't even smell like a dry cleaning shop; it just smells nice and clean.  Also a good place to take uniforms, as they actually know what to do with them.

While there's no shortage of NAPA locations in the East Valley, this is probably my favorite. They've got friendly, knowledgeable staff and easily the best selection of in-stock products of all the locations.  They're also open generous hours on Sunday, making this location one of the few NAPAs where you can get parts and advice seven days a week.

Yes, I am seriously reviewing a greeting card store on Yelp. Why? Kristyn's Hallmark is just that awesome.  I like my cards funny and often a little edgy, and I know I can always find just the thing here. Other Hallmark owners tend to lean toward the disgustingly saccharine, but at Kristyn's there's a great balance between the heartfelt and the hilarious. Whatever mood I'm in, they've got what I want.  Everyone here is also incredibly friendly and helpful.   I drove by it several times before finding it (I used to shop at the other location), so I'll save Yelpers the trouble: Southeast corner of Alma School and Queen Creek, in with and just south of the grocery store (Albertson's?).

I want to love Alpine Valley Bread. I really do. I like supporting local companies when I can, and you don't get much more local than five miles from home. They've also got an overwhelming variety of (theoretically) mouthwatering flavors. They donate tons of bread to local charities. The factory store has crazy insane prices on bread.  But the bread? You know, the only thing they make and sell?  It sucks.  It used to be great. But now they're selling these teeny tiny baby loaves for real loaf prices, and literally nine times out of the last ten (I am a patient, forgiving man) they're gummy, underdone, undermixed, or some combination of the three. I don't feel like playing bread roulette at the outlet prices, much less at the $4 they go for at a grocer.

To crib from Star Wars, "You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy."  "Hell hole" is hardly strong enough to describe what Arizona Mills has become the past few years. The sad thing is it used to be a great mall with a variety of both outlet and mainstream stores.   Now it's filthy, run down, and overpopulated with wannabe hardasses. Many of the best stores have closed or relocated to other malls, the stores that do remain have crappy selection and mediocre prices, and the parking lot has become a wonderful place to have your vehicle dinged, damaged, or disappeared.   Mall management clearly doesn't care about Arizona Mills anymore, so I figure neither should I.

As much as I'd love to give them five stars for pure awesomeness, they don't have quite the selection at the Tempe store of their other stores.  However, this location still has a very wide variety of art supplies for most any media (including ceramics). The employees are all artists themselves and can answer any questions you may have as well as offer advice from experience--as opposed to whatever brand's offering kickbacks this month.  If you're looking for super-low-end cheap crap, Arizona Art Supply isn't your store. If you're looking to pay lower prices for quality art supplies, they'll hit the spot for most customers.

My dad used to shop at REI all the time, albeit complaining about how expensive they were.  And they're certainly not a discount outdoor store--if Popular Outdoor Outfitters hadn't been run into the ground when it changed hands, REI might look positively expensive.  But their prices aren't horrible, and the service, selection, and knowledge are hard to beat. Whatever your outdoor predilection, chances are REI Tempe has it. If they don't, nearly anything REI carries (including REI Outlet inventory!) qualifies for free in-store delivery and takes only a couple days to arrive.  The real key is in membership, though: $20 buys you in as a lifetime member of the co-op. As a member, you get 10% of your purchases back at the end of the year. At that point, REI competes with or even ends up cheaper than many outdoor discounters. Combine that with an exceptionally generous return policy, and it's rare I shop anywhere else for my outdoor gear.  REI stacks up especially well against the newfangled "destination stores" in my opinion. Cabela's and Bass Pro Shops are nice to go wander through and look at stuffed animals, but they're a pain in the ass to actually shop at. At REI, I can be in and out with what I needed without wandering a mile through a mile's worth of merch or fighting for parking.

Two words: Loganberry Shake. That is the key to maximum enjoyment of your Ted's experience.  The hot dogs are good and perfectly burnt (you can of course order them other levels of done if you're a huge weirdo), the specialty sausages are amazing (try a white hot), and the fries are these cute not-quite-full-size cuts that are the ideal balance between crispy outside and mushy inside.  If you go to Ted's for a burger, you will be disappointed. They are not a burger joint. If you go to Ted's for atmosphere... There's no hope for you. It's a hot dog joint.  If you go for meat wrapped in some form of tubing, you should not leave disappointed. Especially if you order the almighty loganberry shake.  Fries. Tube meat. Shake/soda. Stick to the basics and you can't go wrong.

Have you ever been to a used car lot? The really sleazy kind run by guys with only generic first names, or maybe a first name and a horrible nickname, lick "Slick Rich"? You know the way he hovers over you the entire time with his slicked-back hair, well-rehearsed sales patter, and tacky tie trying to shove you into whatever beater is nearby?  Mor is that car lot. Only they sell new furniture instead of used cars. And there are slightly fewer flags strung between the light poles.  Walk in the door, and the salesmen are perched and waiting for their next victim/customer. They fight over you, the winner weaseling his way over and acting like your best friend in the whole damn world while asking the names of everyone in your party, even if only one of you is actually shopping.  And then they'll lead you around the intentionally sprawling store pointing out possible selections from Mor's wide variety of largely tacky, largely overpriced "furniture for less."  Like genital herpes, there's no getting rid of a Mor salesman once he's latched onto you.  The only redeeming quality of Mor would be the free refreshments, but they're (probably consciously) placed just before the exit rather than anywhere you'll encounter them during your visit to hell on Earth.   If you want to shop at your own pace without some flunky trying to suggest pieces at every turn, find another furniture store. In fact, stop next door at the JC Penney Furniture Outlet and see if you can't find something there--the staff won't harass you, and the prices actually are lower than other stores.

A few years back, this was my go-to NAPA. One of the counter guys almost singlehandedly helped me keep my Jeep on the road, and on top of that they were the only store in the area with the most common air and oil filters *on the sales floor*. Great store, friendly people, and you didn't have to wait around for the parts desk if all you needed was a filter.  I don't know what happened since then, but the new counter guy is Mayor of Surlytown and eeeverything's behind the counter again. So no matter what you need, you're waiting for Mr. Grumpy, and when he finally deigns to grunt in your direction, getting your parts is mind-blowingly slow.  Even having your order pulled ahead of time doesn't help.  With parts stores nearly as plentiful as Starbuckses, I don't plan to be back unless they are literally the only place in the EV with a part I need immediately.

It's a tradition in my family that the birthday person gets to pick a movie and we all go see it. Not wanting to deal with the holiday crowds, I foolishly said "Let's go to the theater in Gilbert! It was always really nice, and busy but not nearly as hectic."  And it was. Was being the operative word. Hectic? It's a ghost town. And it's not hard to see why. The seats are torn and filthy, I literally got stuck to the floor, the popcorn was stale and inedible, and the whole place now has the pallor of a business circling the drain.  During our delightful visit to this "premium theater experience" in a "clean, convenient and modern theater" (that's Hollywood Theaters' promise, anyway), I could barely suppress my urge to leave and my brother couldn't suppress the urge to give me crap about it. Speakers were blown, the picture was lousy, I felt like I needed to bathe in bleach afterward... We should have just braved the Harkins at Chandler Fashion Center.  While I practically lived here for several years, ain't no way I'm going back after my last experience.

You're in the vicinity of Black Canyon City. Your pickings are (or at least appear to be) slim. Do you stop at Rock Springs Cafe?  Yes, yes you do.   A reliable road food stop as long as you avoid the weirder corners of the menu, you can fuel up on a pretty damn tasty breakfast or lunch, wander the farmer's market, and gorge yourself on a delicious if slightly unconventional homemade pie. The pies are huge and the slices are generous.  The meringue tends to catch people off guard; it's not the typical airy meringue, but seems to be more of a Swiss meringue with marshmallow creme added. (Per my parents, this is apparently considered a "normal" variation in the Midwest. And I'm sure Paula Deen has heard of it too.) It's wet, it's dense, it's soft, and it's delicious if it doesn't send you into some sort of diabetic coma. If that's not your scene, stick to the fruit pies.  If you're headed home, you can grab a whole pie to go. They've got a punch card program for whole pies, too, scoring you a freebie after you buy enough.  As the obvious stopping point, it's also a great place to people watch and meet other travelers. Unwind a little and take your chances; that grizzled biker is probably friendlier than you think. (Results not guaranteed.)

I'm here pretty regularly for a breakfast meeting, so I've grown pretty well acquainted with the joint.  If I were rating it on service alone, it'd be a solid 5 stars. The waitstaff are always attentive and friendly, have answered questions I didn't even ask (thank you, psychic bathroom directions buddy!) , and know the menu well. They don't even bat an eye at special requests. No matter what size group we end up having, the servers and the kitchen both cope well, too, which is always rad.  The food, alas, isn't as standout awesome as the service. It's not bad by any means. It's edible and tastes good and comes out at the appropriate temperature. The menu's got a great variety. It's just not anything to write home about. If you asked me "Where can I get a reliably decent breakfast," First Watch would be at the top of the heap. If you want a mind-blowingly amazing breakfast, not so much.

Cheap, delicious donuts available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week? Going to BoSa is like having died and gone  to donut heaven.  I can't comment on the ice cream they also apparently sell, but you really can't go wrong with any of their donuts. They're generously sized, super-tasty, and the only aftertaste is of baked and/or fried goods made with love.  If you're in Chandler, BoSa's pretty much conveniently located in the middle of the city. If you're outside of Chandler, it's well worth the drive (or if you're crazy like Brett B., the walk).  Grocery store donuts will suffice when I can barely drag myself out of bed, but when I want the good stuff, I go to BoSa.

This Walmart is a hellhole, even for a Walmart (and I remember when it was nice and new and Walmart was a place you could buy things made in America!).   They hilariously spared every expense in converting it to a SuperCenter, so you can walk around the store and tell where they just bolted more, new store onto the existing, run-down store. It's great.  And it still smells weird. Less like pee than it used to, but still not good.

Is it tacky to turn "Om nom nom" into a review? Because that's my review of El Sol: Om nom nom.  There are lots of great comments here about their (admittedly delicious) breakfast burritos and other foodish Mexican food, but the best part of El Sol in my opinion is the part in its name: the bakery.   Tons of tasty baked and otherwise pastry-based goods. I would kill for their empanadas. Maybe not literally. But figuratively, without a doubt. They're always perfectly done and have a crust that's just right. And they're available in nearly any flavor you could want. I'm totally jonesing for an El Sol empanada now after writing this.

Good, inexpensive, authentic Mexican eats. Indoor seating is limited as others have mentioned, but the patio's covered and fairly comfortable even during the summer.  Try the horchata!

As far as coin-op washes go, it's a winner. The staff do a great job of keeping the wash bays clean, everything is always in working order, and the prices are fair. The timers don't run out too quickly and it's only a buck to start the machine--a heck of a bargain compared to some more profit-minded coin washes.  For a typical coupe or sedan, you could probably easily wash for $2. A midsize SUV can expect $3 to $4 depending on how dirty you decided to get last weekend.  They do have a blower (a buck for thirty seconds) if you want speedy drying, but there are also shaded parking spots nearby where you can towel dry, and with the spot-free rinse, you can honestly just book it down Warner or the 101 and use nature's blower.

Don't be fooled. Brindley's looks tiny (especially if you've been to Milano's Mesa location or think Guitar Center is the pinnacle of a music store). And it's easy to miss. And the parking can occasionally be interesting.  But once you set foot in the door, you'll realize they've packed this place to the gills with everything they can and staffed it with great people. The employees are all very knowledgeable and eager to help, and no matter what instrument you play you're sure to find someone there with the advice and experience you're looking for.  Brindley's has top-tier stuff at very reasonable prices, too, so if you're looking for accessories or expendables like reeds, be sure to stop in or at least call. They've also got a decent selection of sheet music and books.

The Marquee and I have had a lot of bad blood over the years. There was a lot of time it was a really, really shitty venue. But while it's still not my absolute favorite, they've really upped the game from where it was a couple years ago.  A lot of the old complaints have been addressed. Lines move a lot faster. Everything's more efficient. (I shit you not, while attending Chvrches here yesterday, an employee saw the entrance line was backing up AND OPENED ANOTHER DOOR. That's completely inconceivable to most long-time Marquee patrons.) The employees are more friendly. You don't stick to the floor and the floor doesn't stick to you. The air conditioning situation is now "there is air conditioning." The bathrooms are still pretty disgusting by the time everyone's started their headliner beers, but no longer "I just got all three hepatitises by walking in here" disgusting from the moment the doors open.   They've put the effort into making some huge improvements, so I'll no longer skip shows just because they're at the Marquee. It's a solid B+ venue now.

Tempe Camera's kind of a mixed bag these days. On the retail side of things, the selection is worse than it has been in some areas while improving in others. Most of their prices are also--as always--list or higher. Consumables tend to be more competitively priced than equipment. The staff are certainly helpful, though, so they earn some points back there.  Repairs are still something they do very well at excellent prices. I recently had a camera overhauled. It was turned around quickly, relatively inexpensively, and works like brand new. Evaluation of your equipment is still free, as it should be at every repair shop (but often isn't).  Rental equipment I'd look elsewhere for, despite the fact Tempe Camera has a rentals desk.   If you're still shooting film, their lab across the street is still one of the best places in the Valley to get processing or prints. The staff there are exceptionally friendly, perhaps even moreso than the retail store staff, and pricing for services is very reasonable. They've had a reputation for scratching film, but that seems to be improved as of late.

At the ripe old age of 3, it's time for my previous review to take a siesta. Over the course of that three years, Tempe Camera's only gotten better. The selection's improved (finally finding a happy medium between film and digital), the prices are even better than they were, and I dare say service on the retail side's kickass too.  TCR is now my go-to photo supplier as a working pro. They've either got what I need or can quickly get it, they still know their stuff, and they support both local photographic education and the local photo industry. They're also the only dealer in the Valley that sells Think Thank Photo products, which are best damn professional camera bags ever.  And if you're an amateur, they've got plenty of friendly, knowledgeable staff for you too. Don't be afraid to ask for someone else; like almost anywhere, they employ people of varying personalities. There are sales staff I don't click with at TCR, but I wouldn't classify anyone as distinctly rude. (If you want that, you'll have to try B&H or Adorama.) If you need lots of hand-holding, the ASU crush probably means you'll either want to shop at off hours or go to Photomark--TCR tries, but the crowd to counter ratio just isn't favorable at peak times.  Repairs are still something they do very well at excellent prices. When I've had equipment serviced, it's been turned around quickly, relatively inexpensively, and works like brand new. Evaluation of your equipment is still free, as it should ideally be at every repair shop (but often isn't).  The lab's added a bunch of cool new services, including damn fine plexi mounting, and is doing a considerably better job with film than their old reputation for free scratches with purchase would suggest. Hundreds of frames processed with nary a scratch to be found.  Rentals I'm a little more ambivalent about.  They've thinned the herd out considerably (about half the rentals inventory has taken up residence in the used equipment case) and the selection of lighting equipment is basically unchanged, but they've got the latest Canon and Nikon bodies, and everything's well-maintained and in good shape. Rates are good for what they do have--the question's just if they have what you want.

You'll never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy than Fry's Electronics.  Yes, they're often cheaper than Best Buy. Yes, they theoretically have a better selection than Best Buy. But--and this is a huge but--they suck even more than Best Buy.  The store's merchandised poorly, organized poorly, and the employees are awkward, useless, and ready to go postal at any moment. Lately Fry's has been eschewing a lot of quality stuff in their core product line to sell crap they mark up more.   And then we come to the best feature of Fry's: The Little White Sticker. Shopping at Fry's is a game. You win if you can actually manage to find what you want WITHOUT the Little White Sticker on it. If that Little White Sticker is there, you're buying someone else's returned merchandise. Usually with missing parts, and usually at a discount you can count using pocket change. You will often find the product you want is only available in a previously-abused configuration.  True story: They were selling a returned $150 power supply, missing all of its cables, for $149. Bargain of the century!  But hey, they're finally taking all 4 major credit cards!

I don't know what alternate universe I've fallen into over the past year or so, but in this new universe Fry's is actually a pretty damn decent place to shop.  When they finally got around to theming the store, they did some very thoughtful rearranging of sections and merchandise. (The theming itself--the Fry's Open--surely made more sense at the beginning of the process, when the Open was held in Scottsdale.) They also greatly improved some of the sections, with car audio now having actual displays, and the televisions all being displayed at viewing height instead of six inches off the floor.   Veteran shoppers need not feel slighted; there are still some really weird decisions that require arcane knowledge of the Fry's hive mind. iPhone cases and accessories are split between the Apple aisle, the iPhone section, and a third seemingly-nonsensical section. And if you're shopping for a nerdy electronics project, you'll be happy to know breadboards, switches, and soldering irons are still half a store away from resistors, LEDs, and ICs.  Sales floor employees are surprisingly helpful, numerous, and generally competent. WHAT IS THIS? ARE THEY ALL POD PEOPLE?!  Fry's now price matches reputable internet dealers. Cashiers now ask if you'd like your card run as debit or credit, ask you if you found everything you were looking for, and (seemingly genuinely!) thank you for shopping at Fry's.  I can't help but think I've fallen into some twisted alternate universe where we must all also be enslaved by robots, but you know what? I'll take it.

Cheap eats done machine-gun style. If you're expecting fawning service and polite smalltalk, keep walking, because Lee's is all about getting you in and out. Especially during the lunch crush.   That's fine with me, because really all I want is to pick up my bag of relatively inexpensive sandwiches and get on with things.   For more adventurous eaters, there are a wide variety of Asian sandwiches-and the menu is growing all the time. For the timid, all your favorite Sysco near-meat products are available on baguette or croissant. In addition to sandwiches, they have a small variety of Asian-street-foody options, many blended and mixed (soft) drinks, ice cream, and a dozen variations on the ever-popular highly-caffeinated Vietnamese coffee.   Occasionally it smells faintly like cat pee, but that seems to coincide with the appearance of a fresh batch of durian ice cream. Durian: when smelling terrible is the sign of wholesome freshness!

Utrecht and I have a complex relationship. The "competitor prices" they display always seem to come from an alternate universe, and merchandise isn't so much organized as stuffed where there's room (which isn't necessarily bad if you're aware of it), but they've got a good selection, friendly employees, and--most importantly--the house brand.   The whole reason to shop at Utrecht, catalog or retail, is for Utrecht's house-brand paint. They generally beat competing brands in price handily. Their acrylics are made in the US. Quality in the Artist grade paints is top-notch while the "Studio Series" (which is the most euphemistic and optimistic student grade moniker  I've ever seen) ranges, as do most student-grade paints, from decent to mind-blowingly terrible. Skip straight to Artist for difficult colors like yellows if you know what's good for you.  This store maintains an excellent supply of acrylic and oil Utrecht paints in both grades in just about every color you could possibly want. They may even carry the full range. Outside of Utrecht-branded paints, mediums, and substrates, though, you're almost certainly going to get better pricing at Arizona Art Supply. And while Utrecht stocks a wide variety of house-brand brushes, almost to the detriment of name brand selection, they're probably the crappiest brushes I've ever used.  I'd only buy Utrecht brushes for something that's going to destroy them, like resist or masking fluid. But for paint, gesso, mediums, canvas, or paper? Definitely swing by Utrecht.  Pro Tip: Don't even think about shopping here at the start of a semester or near finals. The entire ASU College of Fine Arts--wait, sorry, Michael Crow took that behind a shed; Institute For Design--descends upon Utrecht like a horde of locusts, leaving empty shelves in its wake.

What a shit heap.  The sound is awful, the food is awful, and anything edible or potable is grossly overpriced even by venue standards.  Despite the fact they have two huge projection screens, you'll be lucky if they have one of them working, much less both.  And the tickets... Dear lord, the tickets. If you've going to pack us like sardines into a 100+ degree venue, without even the courtesy of breathing room, lay off the ridiculous prices and magical fees.  There are about a million possible venues in Arizona at which I'd rather see a show than Cricket, and that includes a damp cardboard box on the corner of Van Buren.

Zia, oh Zia, sometimes you kick me in the junk and then want to make out. But that's okay. I don't mind that you smell like a nag champa factory. I even held you tight that Christmas when the kids were taking sketchy pencil rubbings of everybody's cards because the credit card processor went down. (To Zia's immense credit, nothing funky ever showed up on that card.)  Because in spite of your oddities, and your hit-or-miss inventory, and your hit-or-miss employees, you are truly magnificent.  Whatever you want, they're probably got it. My one issue with the inventory is that I frequently shop here for gifts, and it's not uncommon for Zia to have literally dozens of gift list items only as used copies. Some people don't mind receiving good used stuff, but when I need or want to buy new, it's kind of a bummer.  And now, a secret, since several people have mentioned bearing the local record shop's higher prices: Zia usually discounts for preorder and release. If you know there's an album coming out that you want, either preorder it or go buy it the week it comes out. You'll save 3 or 4 bucks over going in the next week. And sign up for the Zia Rewards program, which both accrues reward points and (usually) gets you a survey card good for a discount on your next purchase.

Great repair shop. Honest, friendly, and the prices are reasonable. The labor rates are a little higher than some other shops, but you really get what you pay for. They know their stuff and won't try to sell you on things you don't need, and won't go replacing things willy-nilly in hopes it might fix your problem.  Their turnaround times are better than a lot of shops (especially dealership service departments), and reasonable Saturday hours mean you can get repairs done almost any day of the week. If you're not the DIY type, they also do oil changes inexpensively and quickly, so for crying out loud, quit going to Jiffy Lube and let someone who knows what they're doing service your car!  Do beware the driveways to the shopping center they're in; both are pretty brutal.

They don't have the selection of the enormous Tempe store, but I can't complain about this location. The employees are friendly--even when you do something really dumb like miss a whole shelf full of oil filters--and most of them actually know how cars work! If you need something that's only at the giant Tempe store, they'll call ahead and have it held for you.   I'm in here for consumables and detailing supplies all the time. And batteries every three years or so. Well-organized, well-stocked, and the employees are always eager to help find something.   If I had one complaint (which I'm not docking this store for), it's that corporate's grown a little bit too excited about the register selling opportunities. No, I don't want any of the three crappy Lucas products on special this month. I do not want them for a boat. I will not put them in my goat. I do not want them, CFO, please take your cross-sells and go.

What kind of weirdo is in love with a tire shop? This kind of weirdo. With this specific tire shop.  There's no shortage of Discount Tire locations in Arizona, but everybody in my family keeps coming back to this one because they're just that great. Everyone's friendly, rotations and rebalances are done quickly and correctly, they don't try to sell you tires you don't need yet, and they're more than willing to offer alternate sizes and even test fit tires for you.   Even better, I'm not sure if it's Discount in general or just this store, but they've got moving tires from the warehouse down to a science. It used to be you might have to wait a day or two for the next truck; more recently it's been "We don't have them in the store, but we can install them today if you can come back around 4:30." I'm generally not in that much of a hurry, but it's damn nice if you are.

By and large, I love this Costco location. The bakery staff are friendly and handle special requests with aplomb, the selection of products is great, and all the photo lab technicians are top notch. They also always have great looking cuts of meat at the butcher shop.   Being located just off the freeway also means it's easy to get to from almost anywhere in the East Valley.  My only gripe is that the members only gas station is hardly cheaper (only a couple cents) than local stations. Gas prices at the Gilbert Costco are much lower than the Chandler Costco, despite chain gas station prices being similar near both stores.

Like F.O. said, discovering Bookman's is like hitting the freakin' motherlode.  They have so much stuff it's uncanny. It's like what pawn shops would be if they weren't filled with seedy people and crappy, overpriced merchandise... and, y'know, if they had books.  Books, magazines, action figures, board games, video games, puzzles, CDs, DVDs, electronics, camera gear, random tchotchkes... It's worth going regularly to discover what they have at the moment. You never know when you're going to find a smoking deal on some thing you've wanted forever (or never knew you wanted).  They even stock VHS, audio cassettes, LaserDiscs, and vinyl, if you prefer older technologies to newer ones. And all the employees are so friendly and knowledgeable and generally awesome... Just go already!

Do I really need to update a five-star review with another one? Probably not. But I am.  Most of the remodel of the Mesa store is finally done, and it looks swanky as hell. It's even got that new store smell.  Perhaps more importantly, Bookmans took the time to rethink a huge chunk of the store layout during the remodel. Electronics and video games now have a much larger, easier-to-navigate area. Most of the goods therein are now unencumbered by glass. (I do miss the ancient repurposed Nintendo display cases, though.)   The DVD section has also been reorganized and it's much easier to find what you're looking for now. All the bookshelves have funky new section signs. The checkout and buying counters are both much larger now, making for a faster buying (or selling) experience. There's also a "Pornoire" (an armoire full of porn) I don't recall seeing before. The idea of used porn kinda creeps me out, but the name's awesome.  Apparently at some point the Mesa location's getting a caf√©, too, but that's still "coming soon" as of my last visit.

Three years ago now, I bought a new (to me) Jeep. Six months after that, I let my brother borrow it when his car broke down. Two days into that, he backed it into a pillar at a parking garage. Paint carnage. Luckily for the kid bro, blood's thicker than water, and even a $35,000-for-new vehicle in formerly-pristine condition is just a thing.  After asking around and scrounging the web for reviews, Brighton was  the one place that consistently came up with positive comments. I triple bid the job, and despite coming in the highest even paying out-of-pocket, Brighton quickly took the lead. Everyone I dealt with at Brighton was friendly and warm. Their estimate was the most exhaustive, their process the least painful, and the estimator exuded a sense of confidence and knowledge sorely lacking from the other shops I visited.  The actual repair process was painless. I dropped the Jeep off, they asked if I had a ride, they gave me a target time, and several days later they called to let me know it was done ahead of schedule. Arriving back at Brighton, you'd never know my back end got its grind on with a pillar. The scratches were gone, the dents were gone, the new paint matched perfectly, and my hand-sprayed paint job was noticeably more beautiful than the robots at the Chrysler factory could manage. (Robots can make good paint that will last you a lifetime, but that's all robots care about. My Brighton job is glass-flat and mirror-shiny even with your nose right on it.)  My one complaint is that they left my interior a mess. One piece of trim wasn't installed correctly, there were filthy fingerprints all over it and my headliner, the bits of sealant they removed were still on my carpet, and there was overspray on the inside of my quarter window. I didn't notice it until I got home, though, and I'm a detailing fiend, so I just broke out the box of toys and fixed my own interior. Even considering this, Brighton is  still the single best body shop experience I have ever had--and given the rest of the experience, I can't imagine it was anything but a rare oversight.  I'd gladly take back my own vehicles or send a friend there.

Women have it easy. Every department store, every makeup store, every big box carries a million and one skin care products for women. And most of them employ at least a couple people who can lead you to the right products.  Men? Men are screwed. You're lucky if a store carries the crappy crap Gillette's hawking as skin care and shaving cream, never mind having someone who can say "You should try this."  Enter Sephora. Despite having a teeny tiny corner of the store dedicated to men's products, and the ratio of male to female customers being probably 1:1000, they're great if you're a guy who doesn't want to look like shoe leather. I first visited this location about a year ago to grab one product, and ended up getting some great advice and a ton of samples from one of their staff members. She was exceedingly familiar with the men's lines, and with skin types, and the product she thought I'd like best ended up being the one I returned to buy.   I've returned a couple times since and always had excellent, attentive service. Heck, today I waited in line for all of two minutes, but one of their "beauty consultants" (but I want to be ruggedly handsome!) materialized out of nowhere with a peace offering of samples and an apology. And then I got more samples and more apologies at checkout. They had the cashwrap fully staffed and were moving quickly; there was nothing to apologize for, but they did anyway.

When a place bills itself as "gourmet pizza," it sets a certain level of expectation. Some joints live up to them. Some don't.   Unfortunately Red Brick Pizza falls into the latter camp. And it does so while billing itself as the world's best gourmet pizza. It's fast food quality pizza at best, and doesn't even stumble enough into mediocrity to be on the level of Domino's, much less something like Papa John's (or even Pizza Hut). We're talking worse than Domino's here, folks. WORSE THAN DOMINO'S.  The crust was dense, tough, and flavorless, and if there was actually sauce on the pizza to begin with then I'm not sure where it went. The bigger toppings were less cooked than they were lukewarm, but the cheese was at least melted. It's also worth noting pies top out at an incredible fourteen inches, so if you're feeding a mass of people you'll be buying multiples at ~$16 a pop.  On the up side of things, Red Brick does offer some tasty and attractive salads, the employees are friendly, and the service is fast. Unfortunately that's hardly enough to offset the pizza (unless you're going veg). And while they offer gelato, it's as disappointing as the pizza.

Sprouts is a crazy, crazy land of fresh, delicious meat and produce.  And if you're buying fresh foods, it tends to be ridiculously inexpensive--even compared to the huge conglomerate supermarkets. Super cheap, super tasty apples? Sign me up. The meat is also usually a steal, too. On more than one occasion I've found their whole chickens to be cheaper than Fry's, even in spite of Fry's offering a two-for-one deal. And the Sprouts chickens were frou-frou free range/manicured/massaged birds. Craaaazy.  That being said, I'll totally agree with the comments about the service. Sprouts has a bad knack for putting people who don't give a shit on the butcher case. This doesn't work particularly well since climbing over the counter is frowned upon. Worse, even if you can get a disinterested slacker, chances are good they have no idea what they're doing. Be prepared for lots of pointing, "Your other left"ing, and "No, salmon is the pink one"ing. Not the place to go if you want your meat prepared specially or don't already know what you want.  The rest of the store is awesome, though.

Since I last reviewed this Sprouts location in 2009 (!), it's time for an update. Overall rating: Still 4 stars.  I still have a love affair with Sprouts. The produce is still terrifyingly cheap, the natural foods are still reasonably-priced and frequently on sale, and Double Ad Wednesdays are still the best thing ever. That being said, the deepest discount produce is a little dicier than it used to be; berries in particular suffer from the giant sale displays not being refrigerated. The stuff you envision crazy coupon ladies screaming about? Be prepared to dig for the best stuff. The less desirable produce--you know, the stuff you should probably actually be eating--is still in good shape even on sale.  The meat counter, on the other hand, is vastly improved. A few of the old slackers are still hanging around but the awesome new guys more than make up for it. I've actually had them offer to go dig around in the back for me, which was unthinkable a few years ago.  As part of last year's remodel, they've added a hot soup bar, fresh muffins (delicious), a giant artisinal cheese case, and (foodie trendwhores rejoice!) a gourmet olive bar. Better yet, not only has the bulk coffee taken over A WHOLE AISLE, but the dispensers are now at adult human height. Mmm. Bulk coffee.  If you've been to other Sprouts stores, do check your expectations before walking in the door here; this is store #1 and isn't as large as the later locations (never mind the former Henry's or Sunflower locations). You won't manage one-stop-shopping here, but Fry's is directly across the street for all your not-made-by-hippies needs.

If every Mac reseller were as awesome as MacMedia, Apple would never have had to enter the retail game themselves. I don't care what your platform preference is--these guys are the epitome of the independent computer store.   The sales staff are friendly, no-pressure, and know their products inside and out. And they can walk you through a great variety of merchandise in-store for just about anything you'd want.  The repair staff are equally great, and as members of a dying breed, can actually test and think instead of brainlessly following a flowchart. Even better yet, your diagnostic fees are applied to your repair costs--so unless you opt out of a repair, diagnosis is free.  If you're looking for a Mac or need yours fixed and don't want to swim upstream through the spawning hipster-salmon at an Apple Store, MacMedia is the place to go.

It's two, two, two bars in one!  First, there's the super divey side anyone who ever went to ASU is familiar with. It always surprises people when I say it, but I love it. What's not to love about a bar that looks like it's been untouched since 1972? There's live music, the bartenders are great, and the crowd's an unlikely mix of college hipsters and people who look like they haven't left since 1972. If you've ever wanted grizzled regulars to stare at you wordlessly and nod while a punk band plays, Yucca Classic is your place. It's surreal. If you haven't stopped in for a while, they even have draft beer now! (Oooh, ahhh.)  Second, there's the shinier, newer "craft" side, stocked with damn near any beer you could want (can! bottle! draft!), as well as a shockingly full spirits selection. It's got a different vibe, which I frankly find disturbingly sterile, but it also has 20-30 beers and ciders on tap at any given moment. Suck on that, other bars!  There's a surprisingly adequate kitchen serving both bars with a variety of reasonably-priced options for hangry alcoholics. The street tacos exceed my needs for bar food, and Yucca does mercifully celebrate the international holiday known as Taco Tuesday. Proving that Yucca respects no labels, the menu also sports a handful of Korean fusion options. Because what wood-paneled college town dive bar doesn't have bulgogi and kimchi?  If you're looking for a dive, try this one on for size. Just maybe not on a weekend when it's full of 21-year-old ASU kids.

Hell. Yes.  If you're not adventurous you can build your own sandwich from any of the fixins they've got, but there's good food to be had in their menu. All kinds of delicious gourmet sandwiches. Great bread, unique condiments, and a signature spicy pickle. (Which is both spicy and a damn good pickle.)  The service is consistently friendly and reasonably fast. A little slower than a Subway or its ilk, but the sandwiches are made with love, are more complex, and panini(s?) of course require time on the panini press.  Also: THE COOKIES. Huge, soft cookies with a beautiful crumb. Nom nom.  The only downer--and the missing star--has been the gradual reduction in meat content. Multi-meat sandwiches are still looking tasty, but the single-meat jobs are starting to look a little thin.

I've used University Animal Hospital for boarding my ferret, and they've been absolutely amazing every time.  They cat kennels are immaculately maintained and spacious, the staff deal well with animals of all varieties, and you get a nice summary at pickup of your pet's behavior (including important stuff like eating habits) while you were gone. If you have a cat, they have a variety of options including kennels with a window view (perfect for bird watching) and multiple-cat kennels. Birds, ferrets, guinea pigs... If it's feathered or furry, they've boarded it and had happy customers, many of whom I've met when picking up or dropping off my own animal.  Their boarding prices are reasonable and not at all out of line with other places I called, unlike the complaints some Yelpers have about their veterinary pricing.

Hey! A tea store! What's not to love?  Uh, everything, apparently.  Crazy prices, middling-quality teas, obnoxious minimum purchases, a ridiculous affinity for tutti-frutti blended teas, and a bunch of insipid nonsense about the soul-cleansing properties of boiled leaves.  I especially like the scam they run with the containers. In case you haven't heard this one before, they automatically put your tea into a tin. They don't ask, and they don't bother mentioning that piddly little slave-labor pot metal tin is $7, apparently hoping you go all glossy-eyed at checkout and can't do math in your head. "Goodness," they must hope you think, "tax must have gone up quite a lot!"  Skip it. You can get much better tea with much better service at much better prices by making the trek to Souvia or using any of the reputable catalog companies. Maybe Starbucks will force-feed Teavana some customer service skills after the acquisition is final, but my hopes are not high.

I knew Larada's Army Surplus, and edifice, you're no Larada's Army Surplus.  Take your ideal military surplus store. Now slice it in half, making it smaller and more cramped. Reduce the selection. Make the prices higher. And wrap it in a cast-off Circle K building in an extra-sketchy part of Mesa.  Et voila: You've got Freedom Military Surplus.

Are the kids still saying hells to the yes? Because hells to the yes for the Holsum outlet.  Bakery outlets are generally a fantastic deal, but the Holsum outlet really sweetens the pot with all their crazy promotions and their selection of products you didn't even know existed. Good grief, Holsum is an Arizona bakery, but half the stuff I've seen at the outlet is stuff I've never, ever seen in an Arizona grocery store.  Being an outlet does mean the selection's not consistent and products may be super short-dated, but the prices are great and you can often find bread no older than what's on grocery store shelves.

What isn't to love about OnTrac?  They roll up in unmarked vehicles, "park" (and I use the term loosely) the wrong direction and blocking half the street, walk halfway to the door in unmarked clothing, and then lob your package at the side of your house.  UPS has long been a practitioner of the drop and run, but never until OnTrac had I seen a courier literally throw a package toward my doorstep from eight feet away. Initially I thought it must have been an off day, but the same delivery guy has done the same thing at least four times now.   If you're going to order anything expensive from Amazon, better make sure it's heavy, too. The only packages not delivered by said driver in a projectile fashion have been too heavy to throw. If they'd been a little lighter, I'm sure I would have had broken electronics as well as a hole in the side of my house.  One extra star for the (disappointingly rare) alternate driver, who is both personable and much more careful with his deliveries.

Where Shelby goes my Yelp reviews and unruly mutant hair follow. She's now at Ramon Bacaui Hair so I am too.  Shelby's been taming my hair for probably five years now. Her card says she's an organic hair goddess, and her card is right. She has a seemingly supernatural understanding of hair. Walk in with a head of curly hair that grows crazily in every which way, walk out with a manageable and presentable 'do. I have absolute trust in her mad skills. If you have crazy hair, go see Shelby. If you don't have crazy hair, go see Shelby. Whatever your level of need, she'll work her coiffure sorcery and leave you looking and feeling good.   I've followed her through a couple salons and Ramon Bacaui may actually be my favorite. The reception staff are friendly, the other stylists are friendly, and on the whole it's probably the most laid back, stress-free place yet. It also has the most comfortable shampoo sinks ever. And it's in a great location; before or after your haircut, you can wander around downtown Scottsdale and shop or eat or get your drink on. Better yet, If you're not there at lunchtime (Dos Gringos is right across the street and another restaurant is practically next door), you can literally park at the front door.

Cow town Apple Store and I are friends.  San Tan Village is a crazy mall with a terrible design and even worse parking, but the Apple Store's good in my book. It's much faster to get service here than the Chandler location, the crowds are usually thinner, and in my experience their repairs are done quickly and with plenty of care.   It is a smaller store and doesn't have as much hardware on display, but the service is great and there are still plenty of demo systems.  And if you're an older or less experienced Mac owner, I've seen people running the gamut from 8 to 80 in here getting excellent help from the Genius Bar crew and One-to-One instructors. I wouldn't hesitate to send my grandma to this location for whatever she needed.

Amazing prices. Great service.  They also have a much better selection of Mopar accessories than many other Valley dealerships. You name it, they've probably got it--even if you didn't know it existed, like Mopar Headlight Restorer. If you're looking for brand paraphernalia like model Jeeps or PT Cruiser blankets, Airpark should be your first stop.  Love 'em for parts. They're not always as fast getting parts in as other dealerships, but with much, much lower prices and the superior, friendly service, I really don't care about an extra day or two from time to time.  And hey, who doesn't want to say they bought parts from Alice Cooper's Jeep dealership?

A big part of any wireless provider is the customer service. I recently switched to AT&T and ran into a snafu right out of the gate--so I crossed my fingers and headed to this store.   Walking in the door, I was greeted by a handful of friendly employees eager to help me. A family came in while I was being served and they were treated just as well. Within 5 minutes, I was in and out, my problem was solved, and the employees had answered a couple additional questions I had.   Definitely an improvement over the clueless stoners at Big Magenta Phone Corp, and it definitely started our relationship off on the right foot.

A long, long time ago in a galaxy not far from our own, this used to be a Tip-Top. The quality's never been the same since Tip-Top filed for bankruptcy and SummerWinds acquired their assets.  And it's a real shame. On every occasion I've stopped at SummerWinds to browse, the employees have been both friendly and incredibly knowledgable. They've got a great selection of planters and pots, they've still got a ridiculous Tip-Top-style selection of seeds, and they have just about every soil amendment you could want.   The problem is that their plants suck. For a nursery, their plants really suck. Dead, dying, and bug-molested stock sits around like it ain't no thang, and for most of their plants it's more a matter of picking something that doesn't look completely hopeless and ugly than it is something that looks good.  It's completely crazy to sit here going "Yeah, SummerWinds is an awesome nursery unless you actually want plants." They've often got more variety than the big boxes do, they have a surprising selection of organic transplants (albeit with the same problems), and their prices are great... but it feels like going to the glue factory to find a derby winner.  To their credit, SummerWinds does carry some higher-end stock like young trees and Monrovia-brand plants, which are (unsurprisingly) clearly very carefully cared for. But nine times out of ten I just want some nice flowers, or herbs, or vegetables, which means digging through the flats of corpsified foliage.

My previous review was kind of harsh. Honest, and true, and not mean-spirited, but harsh.  But sometimes, just sometimes, things change for the better. Luckily for Summer Winds (and for me), this is one of those times. Let the harshness be gone!  As of late they've turned things completely around from what I've become accustomed to. The awesome, friendly, knowledgeable staff are still there. But now they have awesome, living, and completely weird plants to go with them.   I have never seen so many varieties of tomatoes, lettuce, or mint in a single place. If you want organic plants, there's no shortage of them here. In some cases organics are actually your only option--and at their very reasonable prices, there's no reason not to buy Summer Winds organics even if you plan on going crazy with the mad science.   Summer Winds hasn't become a one-stop shop for me, but I wouldn't hesitate to send anyone there as a first stop. If you walk out of the door without having spent a dime, you're either not trying at all or you have very specific desires. At the very least you can buy an army of thousands of ladybugs for under $10. (You know you want one. I know I do.)

Papi Chulo's seems to have sorted out some of its issues since it was first reviewed. Our service was good (even in spite of being a packed house), and the menu offered a reasonable selection of both a la carte and meal options.  But it definitely ain't perfect.  The first issue is one of image. Papi Chulo's doesn't seem to be entirely sure what it wants to be. The decoration is homey and elegant. The hostess and the (I'm assuming) owner are dressed up. The rest of the front-of-house staff is dressed like it's a coed Hooters, though, with the ladies in cutoff booty shorts and most of the men in Hawaiian shirts.   The second--and perhaps bigger--issue is the food. It's not bad, it gives the appearance of freshness, and the meat is cooked well. But as has been mentioned, it trends toward blandness. Most of the food arrives from the kitchen unseasoned and without sauce. Not quite what you'd expect from a joint advertising Mexican and Sonoran specialties. The fresh salsas are decent and add something, but there's a whole lot of flavor missing that you can only get before or during the cooking process.  I was more than a little confused/amused by being served raw onions and peppers. Warm tortillas, hot cooked meat, melty cotija... and stone-cold raw and crispy veggies. Can't say I've ever had that experience before. Can't say I want to have it again.  Our visit was topped off by our server having an emotional breakdown and subsequently either sobbing or being ultra-bitchy with you. Yaaaay.  All in all, there are better places in Old Town to get hit on by drunk girls. Papi Chulo's has the ingredients to make something better, but I'm not sure they've got the recipe.

A long time ago, Rigatony's was a Golden Corral. Thankfully Golden Corral went out of business and Rigatony's moved in.  I'm hitting broken record level here, but the oft-repeated "Olive Garden but better" is pretty accurate. Good Italian-American fare with a large, varied menu. Special requests don't scare them, the service is great, and the food is tasty and hot whether you're dining in or taking out. A lot of places just dump your food into containers; Rigatony's packages everything carefully so it stays its best and an appropriate temperature. (And they fill your salads so full the takeout boxes hardly close.)  The salad is damn near the best salad ever, and if you don't save room for dessert you're really missing out.   BEWARE THE PARKING. Rigatony's is packed just about every night for dinner and packed to the gills on weekends. If you're driving a large vehicle (or just aren't comfortable in cramped lots), consider parking on the street. It's a decent neighborhood, and there's enough activity I don't think I've ever heard of anyone getting broken into.

My family's been using Wolff to service and maintain our HVAC system for years, and we've always found them to be professional, reasonably priced, and honest. We've had the occasional tech who's a little wet behind the ears, but even they've just taken a little longer to do the same work.

Let it be known: THIS is how you do an express carwash. Friendly, English-speaking employees. A sane pricing scheme. Vacuums and compressed air out the wazoo, at least half of which are in the shade at any given time.   Nowhere at Clean Freak will you find a windshield "repairman" circling like a vulture for the next kill. One cashier, one tunnel attendant, one mechanized tunnel o' love. Perfect. Anal retentive? You can even buy an unlimited monthly pass and wash your car as many times as your black heart demands.   Bring a towel to clean up the drips while you vacuum (and blow out the crevices) and it's all the satisfaction of washing your car with none of the effort!

Half restaurant (Re), half bar (BAR), all pretty awesome.   The food? Great. The Mac is fantastic, the desserts are rich, and the nachos are well worth your future coronary bypass. Hint: Pulled beef is the one true nacho option.  The bar? Shockingly on top of things and mostly reasonably priced. Even if it's packed on a weekend, you won't be standing around being impatiently sober. That being said, there's a pretty serious difference in pours between bartenders, so find your favorite and patronize/tip/flirt appropriately.

This branch doesn't exist anywhere but the Chase branch locator. It's not on Gowalla, it's not on Foursquare, it wasn't in my Yellow Pages, and it wasn't even on Yelp until I added it to write this review.  Having banked at this location, I'm fairly certain of the reason: This is not a bank, but rather a thin fa√ßade over a Hellmouth.  The tellers are rude and have no damned idea what they're talking about, the bankers are useless frat bros in ill-fitting suits with only a tiny bit more product knowledge, and everyone's hell-bent on selling you whatever the overlords at JPMorganChase are demanding they stuff down everyone's throats this week.  I am not Beetlejuice or Bloody Mary. Asking me a fifth time if I'm sure I don't want a credit card, loan, or line of credit is not going to magically make me say yes. I don't want to make a deposit at your desk where you just happen to have credit applications and pens. I don't want a loan, ma'am, just a deposit slip.

NOTE FROM THE FUTURE: Shelby's now over at Ramon Bacaui Hair in Scottsdale.  It's in a great space. They play great music. Everyone who works there is friendly and attentive. They support local artists. And it smells good thanks to all the weird herbs Aveda stuffs into their products.  I got probably the best cut I have in recent history--and that's saying a lot for a curly-haired freak like me. Shelby took plenty of time to figure out what my hair did (both good and bad) and tailor the cut to my evil, evil hair. My hair actually still looked good after washing it out the day after. Score!  Also, score for the salon experience. Massages, hot towels, great-smelling hair products... It's like taking a freaking vacation just getting your hair cut. I walked out relaxed and feeling great.  My kyptonite, though, is the price. It's a great experience, but I don't get a lot of wear time out of my hair. To be fair, Mood Swings does offer free trims between cuts. And they'll knock $5 off if you prebook. So all told, it probably costs less to get a cut at Mood Swings... but it feels more expensive when I'm paying it all at once and whipping out a credit card. And thank God for the dick between my legs.

Not to be confused with the nearby and completely unrelated Chen's Chinese Restaurant  It's your typical American Chinese done pretty darn well. All your standby fried breaded chicken dishes are here, but they're surprisingly light and crispy instead of heavy and soggy. Everything else you'd expect to see is also here, and generally tastes pretty darn good.   Nothing on the menu makes me want to stand up and scream "wow," but it's solid Chinese, it's within spitting distance of my grandfather's retirement community, and the staff are always friendly and accommodating.

How to gain a customer for life in one easy step: When I call 45 minutes before close on a Saturday to ask about ordering parts, tell me you should have them in-store before 9 am on Monday. What?! Witchcraft! But this apparently business as usual there.  I've known Sierra Expeditions existed for a couple years--I used to see the owners' Liberty around my neighborhood all the time--but only had an excuse to try them when my factory shocks finally called it quits. And I'm glad I did, because not only do they have an great selection of in-stock toys (be sure to wander around the shop if the outdoors is your playground), but the speed with which they can have almost anything else in your hands is amazing.  They didn't need a deposit, I didn't have to prepay, just "Oh yeah, we'll move that over from the warehouse for ya." The whole thing was too easy and Wil clearly loves what he's doing. With several more upgrades planned for the future, I now know where everything's coming from.

I've passed this place since it opened, assuming it was just the latest crappy franchise wing place to pop up.   That was dumb. I didn't know it was humanly possible to find wings this good anymore. Perfect crispy outside, perfect moist and tender inside, and your choice of over a dozen sauces ranging from the common to the unexpected. If you're anywhere near ATL Wings, go and get some awesome wings.   Tony Bourdain would appreciate their mastery of the fryolated arts. Wings? Awesome. Fried okra? Fantastic. Every other fried thing I've tried? Good to great. The celery served with the wings is pretty sad, but I don't personally buy wings for the vegetables.

While I don't often end up in the neighborhood of monOrchid, I can say without a single doubt that I'll end up at Songbird every time I do.   The coffee is delicious, the ambiance is laid back and friendly, and the locally-sourced food options are excellent. Pastries? Awesome. Cookies? Tasty. Burritos? I want to go to there. Where "I" is "a burrito" and "there" is "my mouth."   I haven't tried the tea, but if they've chosen that partnership as well as their others, I have no doubt it's damn fine.   In fact, it's probably best I don't end up near Songbird too often, because otherwise I'd be morbidly obese and permanently jacked up on caffeine. Go, relax, have some good food and drink with some very nice people.

Bosa, you've been dethroned.   I don't know what miraculous alternate dimension Golden Donuts warped out of, and frankly, I don't care. What I do care about is a quality donut, and on that, Golden totally delivers. Perfect old fashioneds. French crullers without that all-too-common weird grittiness. Amazingly light, perfectly glazed raised donuts. Cinnamon swirls that actually taste like--get this!--cinnamon.  The stamp on the box boastingly proclaims them to be "The Best Donuts in Arizona," and I can't disagree. The only donut I can even begin to criticize is the long john, and it's not even bad, it's just that I prefer mine a little taller than Golden's flatter (but still quite delicious) version.

I like Zipps generally. The Phoenix locations have never let me down. The Ocotillo location, on the other hand, apparently didn't get the memo about what a Zipps is supposed to be.   The food is terrible; entrees are consistently made incorrectly, arrive at the wrong temperature, and are served in meager portions. (Chicken focaccia with a whole whopping tablespoon of diced chicken? Hell yeah!) Fries and rings are likely to be inedible by virtue of the line serving up whatever stale, rubbery and/or flaccid crap has been sitting around all day instead of dropping a fresh batch.   The service is terrible; it's inattentive and extremely slow. 90 minutes. For lunch. With a handful of diners. Starting wistfully at your empty glass is a way of life here.   The building itself is terrible; the design of this location is so acoustically bad that you literally cannot hear the person sitting next to you.  Go somewhere else. Anywhere else.

My first thought after dining here was "Jesus, I hope Panera doesn't screw up existing Paradise stores this badly."  There's no place to wait in line. The dining room is cramped. The kids working here don't give a damn. And, as another reviewer mentioned, the patio is--for reasons inconceivable to anyone who's even visited Arizona--on the west side of the building. I get that Ocotillo is full of cold-blooded elderly people, but even my nonagenarian iceberg-veined grandfather declared it "too damn hot to sit in the sun."  The food was... edible. Soups and salads were actually pretty decent. The sandwiches, most of which are lifted wholesale from Paradise's menu, were not good, with weird, tough, chewy bread, less meat than Paradise, and absolutely no care in their prep. (Including chunks of skin still on my avocado. Appetizing!) Tea was stale, frozen drinks were half-melted before being delivered, service was slow, and nothing came out together.  Drive the extra five minutes to Paradise at Germann & Gilbert instead. Better food, better service, and you get a free cookie. Or if you really don't mind a drive, the Paradise at Ray & Price is head and shoulders above both.

Hell. Yes. This mini-Pasty is an amazing little hole in Mill Ave that transports you to another place altogether. If you didn't know you were in Tempe, it would feel like Portland or Seattle or half of Southern California.   It's pared down to the essentials: a half-dozen or so rotating pasty varieties, a smattering of soups and apps, and about a dozen draft beer options with one rotating tap handle, all crammed into a shoebox with nothing but a bar and a couple teeny tiny two-tops. But that pared-down space is also super cool, with tin ceilings, funky light fixtures, and super cool subway tile walls.  If you've ever been on Mill and thought "Man, I wish Cornish Pasty Co was closer," this place is the answer to your hand pie prayers.

Earlier this year, my Jeep's blower motor decided it would only run on high. This was not a good way to start the summer. And of course my nearest Jeep dealer closes at a ridiculously early time on Saturdays.  I was venting about it while out to lunch with my parents, and my mom offered "I think there's a Jeep dealership at Superstition Springs." I balked; Superstition Springs feels a lot farther away in 2009 than it did in 1990.   But I wanted my air conditioning, so I called anyway. They answered promptly, were extremely friendly on the phone, and had my glorious blower motor resistor in stock at the parts counter. Alright then--let's hit the 60. By the time I arrived, my extremities were numb (by virtue of running the A/C on high for 15 miles), but dammit, cheap resistor available today!  The front desk wonderfully pointed me to parts, parts welcomed me with open arms, and several dollars plus tax later I had my precious. I checked out some of the accessories they had on display, and they had good prices on those too.
