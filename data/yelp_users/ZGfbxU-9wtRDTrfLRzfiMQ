I loved this zoo! I'm from cincinnati and our zoo is great. I've also been to Columbus and that zoo is tough to beat. Overall I would say this is upward toward cinci's. I think going today was good timing because there were a few times I thought I was going to keel over from the heat and walking on the blacktop. I would guess going during the summer would be TOUGH! The animals were still out today and we were able to feed some giraffes and pet stingrays (: it was no surprise the food and drinks were overpriced but what can you expect.  Just bring your own to tote around and you're set. My experience was great and I imagine it'd be just as great for people with kiddos....if ya haven't been....go!

Right down the street from maizies this is a great place to end your Monday night. I haven't experienced the food because I was always stuffed after the burger ar Maizies. But this is a great Monday spot because you don't pay for pool!  There are a lot of locals who frequent here, I would guess more on Monday. That's very much a guess because its the only day I went! You know what happens when you assume though...  Anyhow! It's very low key with great prices on drinks! Bar tenders are happy to give up suggestions when you're ready for something new. This is nice when you're as indecisive as myself.  They have loads of games besides pool. Darts, touch screen, etc. You will NOT be bored! (:  The patio is a tad small and on a main road, but that's ok I was always too busy inside on the games to notice.   I like this place because the people and bar remind me of the east coast in a way. I will be returning!

I have been here twice, both for the Boxer Luv event to raise money.  The first time I had brought my pup in for a wash and nail trim and the second I worked the event.  Malinda and her staff were great both times, the first I was totally comfortable dropping off my furry babies.  And while working they were a huge help, but I also thought it was amazing they opened on a Sunday to support a great cause.  That alone I thought was great!  They are incredibly clean and well maintained as well as love the dogs that go in and out of the establishment.  If you're in Ahwatukee I wouldn't hesitate to check this out if you're looking for a groomer.  A+

Love this place! I came one time after work my debit card was stolen the night before, they don't accept checks and I couldn't get cash before they closed. The man gave me my slip detailed my car and let me come back the next day. Mortifying but so nice and trusting! Aside from that they always do a great job for an awesome price (: happy customer!!

I noticed this place pulling in to the shopping center where Barrelhouse was......a video shop? what in the heck....so weird.  Anyway, I walk out and I realize I have been looking for Devil's Reject's and House of 1000 Corpses for god knows how long.  Screw it, why not check this place out!?  If you thought to yourself...man, video stores have been out since the early 90's.  Not this one!  This one has been out since the 80's.  The carpet had like, palm trees.  And even better there's an adult section in the back that has mint colored palm tree cut outs that go across the top of the doorway....must be the entry way to heaven. o.O  Unfortunately, they didn't have either movie I wanted.  Otherwise I would've gotten past the ugliness and the stale smell of my indoor childhood skating rink.  I have no reason to come back to this place because I live in THIS century and I will just buy them online.   So much for nostalgia.

I went here for a staycation one weekend kind of out of the blue.  I mainly picked it from the pool reviews and awesome pictures.  I have to admit, I was not disappointed.  This place is beautiful and not to mention HUGE.  It was really nice walking around the property at night...I actually felt like I wasn't in Phoenix for a minute.  Something I really liked too is that they have a 24 hour pool.  Psh...awesome.  They also had a bar on your way out to one of the patios and it had shuffle board which is only a positive.  Laid by the pool all day Saturday afternoon, the guys that walk around are awesome.  Just know that they close the pool AND the bar at 6PM...weird.  But it is amazing to spend the day by the pool and have people wait on you hand and foot by a hotel.  It wasn't full of kids, but they were there.  It's just a good place if you want to relax to spend the afternoon.  No unce unce, but there is music in the background so that was coolio. I loved the night atmosphere because it was quiet and laid back which is exactly what I was feeling.  If you're looking to party this probably isn't the spot, but if you're looking for an amazing relaxing weekend....this will do it 100%.

Love Scooby-Do's they're so friendly!  Every time I come in they cuddle up my dog and make him feel comfortable right away.  When I come pick him up he's not terrified so I can only imagine they are just as kind when I'm not around :) The service, people, and location is fabulous ! Love this place!

This past Friday was my first time at this venue.  It did not dissapoint!   I was lucky enough to win tickets and sit on stage while John Lengend performed.  From my view it was toug to focus on anything around me other than the performance, but it didnt look like there was a bad seat in the house.  The acoustics in this place are incredible!  Looked like the onky place that might have a tough time seeing was the upper balcony....its pretty high up there.   Parking was quick and easy to find. Pretty small part of phx so that was a pleasant surprise.  The box office for tickets was a challenge to find and there werent any helpful signs.  So if youbuy in advance go a little early so you can find your way through the maze.  The positive side of that was the grounds were REALLY pretty.  There were bands playing outside and everything was very green and clean.    Overall, it was a great experience and if i have the opportunity i will be back. :-)

I, like most people, purchased a Living Social voucher for this place for a facial and brow shaping for $35.  That's pretty incredible!  I have never had a facial before so I had no idea what to expect out of this experience.  I am somewhat particular about my brows so I was a bit nervous, but then again I haven't found anyone in the valley that I like yet so may as well!  My services were with Brandi and she was awesome!  She was very friendly and professional so I felt completely comfortable throughout the entire time.  For my brows she talked to me about what I wanted them to look like and showed exactly where she was going to remove the hair before even starting - NICE!  I love how they came out and was overall happy with them!  As far as the facial she does arm/hand massage while the masks are hardening.  It was super relaxing and the place was clean and quiet.  The best part was at the end I was asking about setting up facials on a monthly basis and she made me aware that if I were to do so for the next SIX times I went I would receive the same pricing! :-o  This place is great, customer service is killer and Brandi was awesome!  I already set up my next appointment and cannot wait to return!

This is a fantastic place if you're looking for a delicious meal and for what it is, it's a great price. I am a HUGE fan of the filet, but you put the green chile mac and cheese in front of me and it's game on! I love coming here and posting up at the bar for a few drinks and a very yummy steak. I will always come back here if someone is up for it! :)

This Zipps is my favorite one.  The location is close to home and I love I can ride my bike for a Zipparita !  I stick with your standard hot wings and a strawberry Zipparita.  Honestly, I think I've had something different....once.  I just prefer to have what I like!   The location is clean and the patio is great!  Bartenders are always friendly and fast, fast is always good when it comes to alcohol. :)  Shuffleboard isn't always open, but the upside is...they have pool and the touch screen game thingy (that's my favorite).   If you don't want the unce unce, but what to be in Old Town this is not a bad place to be.  Also, if you want to change up the scenery Clancy's is next door which is also a great spot !

One word...DELICIOUS!!  When we walked in we were greeted by what I'm not sure was the owner, chef or both. But he had is white jacket on and was pretty involved with all of the tables pretty much the whole time.   We ordered a veal bolognese and the chicken Parmesan. Both were absolutely delicious and the portion sizes were huge!  Our server was extremely friendly and made some great suggestions for dinner!   It's super casual but you could still wear something nice if you were feeling it. I will definitely return here. And next time I may share a dish so I can have some tiramisu.    A must try!!

I just went to Trader Joe's for the first time last night....seriously.  It's smaller than I expected, but in a good way.  I stood just staring at the dried fruit and nuts like it was a maze.  I was approached by a nice employee asking if I needed any help. (I think he could tell I was a noob.)  I came in on a mission for healthy trailmix so I didn't do a lot of exploring.  The building was clean and the employees were all very helpful.  Cleanliness is obviously HUGE for a store selling food. :)  I'm looking forward to going back and moseying around for more yummy ingredients.  On a side note, I did notice they had more protein bars in one aisle than I've seen without going to a health food store.    As a first timer, I was impressed!

I mean, I'm a regular.  I clearly enjoy it here. The darts in the front are my favorite....along with Orange Blossom like everyone else and their mother.  It's so good I could brush my teeth with it.   The food is nothing to write home about, but the pizza is pretty decent.  The spin dip is....just.....bleh.  Just stick with pizza and beer.  I do like that I can pick up a growler of orange blossom on the way home.  I also really enjoy playing shuffle board in the back room.  Oh another thing I really enjoy....the board games.  They have JENGA! Hell yeassss!  It's a great place, in a tiny strip mall, with great beer.  Who'd a thunk it ?!  Pretty much everyone has been here so I don't think it takes too much explaining on why it's fantastic.  So to sum it up....games, beer, games...beer.  Enjoy!

The perfect spot in less than a mile from my house when I can't drive because I've been out all night.  I'm not saying you won't feel it the next morning, but look - we have all been here.  I mean you've seen the commercials...and if you haven't been to Jack in the Box it's time to re-evaluate how you're living, or not living.   You're not going to have the best burger that you've ever had...you're not.  It is going to cure your hunger and make you regret it the next day.    This is too close to my house so I'll be back.

Who doesn't love Four Peaks?  This is a great place that's good for happy hour drinks and appetizers or just dinner.  The food is delicious every time and the beer is always cold and yummy ! The parking can sometimes be a pain with the tiny gravel lot in the back so it tends to be easier if you just park on the street.  In my giant SUV I find it's easier to park on the street, personally.  Their spinach dip is to DIE for...literally....I'd die. The patio is decent, not phenomenal...the inside though is really laid back, cool, industrial feel to it.  Service is always great whether at the bar or table. I think at this point everyone in the Phoenix are have been here....if you haven't - now ya know !

I love this place.  Sometimes when you go into a shop like this and you don't dress like the every day hipster it can be a little annoying.  For you and the people working in the shops.  Here it doesn't matter, they're always super kick back and ready to help and educate anyone who pops in.  I imagine this is a good thing being right on Mill Ave.  They have a lot of awesome randomness which is something I enjoy after having a few cocktails, it makes perusing a lot more fun!  They always have really neat glass pieces, the sherlocks are what catch my eye.  Awesome place!

Philly's is a great spot if you want to kick back with some good bar food and drinks.  I used to live in the apartments behind Philly's and would wall myself on over to post up at the bar.  Perfect.  Now I have moved further up into Scottsdale and still find myself posting up here.  They have a nice patio with the outside bar, TV's and of course misters!  The bartenders are always friendly and quick with service.  As far as food goes they actually have some pretty delicious bar food! Mozzarella sticks, potato skins, loaded fries, and the yummy wings!  They have that yummy creamy ranch that you could swish in your mouth.  Okay, that's a little overkill but it's really good. :)  They have good drink specials and if your order something that's not on special they will make a suggestion for what is (ie. Captain n' Coke, Sailor Jerry's n' Coke).  Everyone should appreciate that !  Don't pass this place up.  Especially if you like watching sports at the bar, it's worth going here.  Don't expect anything fancy though, it is a laid back bar so plan to just enjoy yourself with friends or alone at the bar is fine too.

I checked the ratings on Yelp before visiting this place.  Everyone went on and on about it saying how if you live in Phoenix it's the place to go.  Uh....NO.  It was disgusting.  It was over priced for what it was and not worth it at all.   My advice...if you're looking for fast food seafood just go grab some frozen food and put it in the oven.  That's going to be much better than anything you're going to get here.

I have been coming to this vet since I moved to Arizona from Kentucky.  They have always been so friendly and welcoming.  Let's just be serious, when it has to do with anything about your furry family (especially health) we are very cautious.   It's convenient and has plenty of parking out in Tempe.  I moved to Scottsdale and still drive a few minutes out to make sure I still come here.  The doctors and tech's are always really friendly and sweet with the animals, as to be expected. :)    Overall, this place is very clean and well kept - I love it here and so do my pets! :)

Being from the humid city of Cincinnati I can appreciate the fact that the ceiling closes here.  I'm serious!  The stadium is clean and has your typical stands for food/beer/ice cream, but the roof is what makes it!  Love coming here for games, always a blast and tons of nearby restaurants and bars to end the night on a great note!

Being so close to this place I couldn't pass up checking it out.  It is on a street that looks like it could be only residential homes so it can be easily missed.  However, this is one place you don't want to drive by without stopping in!    They had a live band and place was crowded from wall to wall.  We got lucky and a group left from the room facing the street.  The art that flooded the place were all local artists which made it that much better.  It is definitely a "hip" bar so don't walk in with your heels on lady..things could get weird. =)  The bar is SUPER tiny with only 2-3 stools and two bar tenders avoiding stepping on each other with each filled order.    They don't serve hard liquor here so it will be wine or beer....which is A-OK with  me!  They have a fairly decent wine selection so you won't feel too limited.  I didn't pay a whole lot of attention to the band.  To be honest, I think I was 3 glasses of wine by this time. :-p  The patio outside was pretty cool, it was like someone's backyard.  I love the character of this bar it's much different than anything offered in Scottsdale.  Great experience !   I'm looking forward to going back on First Friday.

Why talk about a gas station on yelp?  I dunno....  Is it in a convenient location?  Yes, it's like in the middle of Galvin on the way in to Scottsdale.  Is it spic'n span? No, it's a gas station.   Do they have a beer cave? Yes, it's just as glorious as any other.   Is it over run with homeless people?  Nope, you should feel as comfortable as one can at a gas station.   I stop here pretty regularly being that it's on the way home from work, they have gas and beer.   Good enough for me.

I don't have any need to really use this store too often being that I live right by the Fry's on McDowell.  Although sometimes if it's on my way home it's a bit more convenient.  With that being said...I think this place is like a historical landmark at this point.  It's super tiny and quite outdated.  If you're looking for anything out of the norm that you couldn't find at a 1950's piggly wiggly, odds are it's also not here.  Everyone is friendly.  And to be quite honest, I kind of like that it's small.  It tends to make trips much shorter than they normally are.   I have never been here and felt like it was overly crowded.  Which that's either because I go at strange times or people tend to avoid it.  Either way, with it's size you'd think it would always feel packed.    I'm sure that I will continue to use it out of convenience.  I have never felt that it was dirty or unkempt.  As I said, the staff is friendly and it's a bit nice that it's easy to find things due to it's size. :)

Loved EVERYTHING in this store.  It's very shabby chic and for anyone who loves Potato Barn this is right up your alley!  The cool thing is that they also will customize the pieces for you and the fabric selection is great!  If you're looking for something different, pretty and great quality this is it.  There were only a few items I thought were priced a little high, but if you're looking for quality I guess that's something to expect.  If you have eclectic taste, check it out. :)

I've never been a frequent chiropractic visitor, but when your back hurts you find one...fast.  I was experiencing awful pain in my lower back and found Dr. Steve on the web.  What a great find!   He is very friendly and I really like the fact they do a preliminary xray. He adjusted me the first day, went back the next to discuss my xray and was adjusted again. Finally...relief.   It can be a bit pricey $50 first visit and $45 thereafter, but one must pay for quality when it comes to health. I would absolutely recommend him to anyone looking for a new chiro.

First Watch is a little taste of home for me.  I had no idea this was even in the valley until I had a stay cation further up north in Scottsdale.  I have literally never been disappointed in anything I've eaten here.  Pancakes? Amazing.  Omelet? Amazing.  Skillet Hash?  Well...you get it.  I go here every time I'm home in Kentucky so I'm sure you could imagine how excited I was to find out it's in the desert!  It's not quite as amazing as some of the other breakfast places in the valley, but when something reminds you of home it doesn't always matter.  If you're nearby and can pop in, do it !

We all know that these things are incredible I mean, it's no secret!    These cupcakes are made by angels in the clouds.  They are moist and full of flavor.  I love the dark chocolate and the red velvet.  The only thing I surprisingly don't care for are the HARD candies on top.  The first/last time I bit into one I thought I broke a tooth, it was like plastic.  I actually thought it was plastic until my friend chomped one away.    This location is teeny with very little parking next to the building.  However, it's right across from the mall and it's actually pretty convenient.  It always looks like it's packed by the extremely long lines out the door, but they move very quickly so the line goes fast.   The girls working are always very friendly and great at suggesting new flavors.  I called recently to get 12 pack for a friends birthday and they had them done within less than an hour, packed up and ready to go.  I also got a puppy cupcake which her dog seemed to REALLY enjoy. ;)  The Birthday packs aren't too bad about $45 with the puppy cupcake.  They were a huge hit and no one was disappointed. :)  This place is delicious and I love sweets.  I will be back, like the terminator.

Look, coming from the east coast I was never huge into Mexican food.  But let's just get real here....this place is THE BOMB.COM!  It's a tiny little spot tucked away in Old Town in a strip mall so it's pretty random.    From the moment that Cucumber Marg touched my lips...it was over.  Right now they also have the Cantaloupe Marg that is new for the summer and it is also glorious.  I mean, the only one I haven't liked was jalapeno and that's only because I don't like a hot kick to my beverages, I like them to refresh me not kick me! ;)  They also have the tequila challenge which I have yet to begin, but one day I will start !  You can get on the plaque as well as a t-shirt.  Legend says, if you go one step further you get happy hour (or half price, I can't remember) drinks for life!    Their street tacos are also D'LISH!  My favorite is the Tinga, shredded yummy chicken with their sauce and cabbage! Amaze.  I have tried the majority of them and have not been dissapointed.   When it's nice out the patio is cute and quaint, not a bad spot to post up having some margs.  Otherwise, the vibe inside is also pretty great.  Bright and vibrant plus you can actually see the crowd rather than the alley outside where it's a bit more intimate.   Overall, this place is BOMB - TRY IT !

This place is d'lish for seafood in the desert !  My boyfriend and I have been twice in the past few years because it is pretty far on the west side for us.  But it is well worth it when we are craving some crawfish or crabcakes!  It's easy to pass by if you haven't been because it is along side the highway shortly after you pass Bobby-Q's.  The front entrance is very pretty with the vines, fountain and greenery.  It's nice to see this in the desert...it cools things down drastically !  The bar inside is great and every time I've been it's always been packed but chairs open up pretty quickly.  The bartenders are great and always happy to tweak drinks (I got the mango margarita and added strawberry puree). :)  They had oysters flying outta that bar like ninjas!!  I wished that I liked them because it's part of what everyone loves about this place.  Just can't get past that texture....yeesh.   When we sat we were in the back room that if this restaurant was on the water we would be hanging right over it....I wish.  Our waiter came back who was VERY stressed out - he stressed US out !  Wiping the sweat from his face, hands shaking, running back and fourth.  It's a good thing they have food runners who help out because I'm not sure we could have handled that all evening.  Now, onto the good stuff....  We ordered a small bowl of Seafood Gumbo to share and try as well as the Fried Calamari.  The Seafood Gumbo was delicious with a little bit of spice to it, lumps of seafood which I'm pretty sure is what gave the yummy broth it's good flavor! Calamari was crispy and good.....not as good as Salt Cellar, but good. :)  For dinner we split the Seafood Platter which they split up for us before it got to our table.  It had.....EVERYTHING.  Crawfish, crabcakes, stuffed shrimp, oysters, etc.  It was a MASSIVE portion so do not order this on your own unless you can gorge yourself into a coma.  I don't recommend it because they have a lot of desserts to chose from.    On that note, we ordered the creme brulee.  Good....lawd.  It was amazing.  the inside was super creamy and perfect. Top was crispy as expected with a side of strawberries and raspberries.  I was very happy with our choice on desert!

I love this Petsmart!  It's in a great, convenient location with plenty of parking.  I can pop in here while I'm doing shopping everywhere else so it is not out of my way.  The store is always uber clean so I don't feel bad about bringin the ole' pup here.  You know, you've been into stores where you don't want your own dog touching things. Sick.   The staff is incredible here!  I've been here a million times and they're all super friendly and helpful.  I swear they all know what's up in this place.  Fleas? No problem.  Dog outfit?  Funny, I'm actually a personal shopper for pets.  Bath soap?  Allow me to show you where that is.  Pet hotel? HA! We have that in the back.   This is a great spot to go for your pet and they always have really cute seasonal outfits.     Oh, and don't forget....when checking out make sure you donate to the homeless pets! :)

I have passed this cute little joint a couple times and I felt like today was a great day to make the plunge!  I was not disappointed in the least.  I got a coffee and a muffin both of which were delicious.   The place was quaint and laid back and made me feel right at home.  For a person who does not like sitting in a coffee shop or restaurant alone that is quite the accomplishment!  Needless to say, I will be a returning customer...I recommend to all coffee drinks that have not been...to go! (=

I love Pink Polish!  The nail bar is great, gives a completely different feel from the "common" salons.  I have had a few instances where I made an appointment with a recommended person and the wrong woman has done my nails.  I was frustrated both times, but after finding Vivian I haven't gone through it again !  This is a place every girl/woman should try at LEAST once ! :)

Monday night burger specials. Enough said. $5, gourmet burger. Their fries...to die. The dip that comes with....you're dead. The servers are always friendly.  If you go on Monday be prepared to wait. I'm pretty sure it's everyone's favorite night. Why wouldn't it be?  The pixy stick martini will push your idea on this place beyond what you thought was possible. It's so sweet, but not too sweet. Delicious!   Location is good, close to other spots in phoenix. Parking can be tough because there are only like 7 in front of the restaurant.   The ambiance is laid back and cute lighting with tea lights. The servers are always great!  You will be happy you stopped in here!

When I first moved into Scottsdale from Tempe I wanted a dive bar next to my house like I always had in Tempe.  For 3mos I didn't even know Dukes existed!  Luckily I finally found my way over into the random strip mall it's tucked into and checked it out.  So....the most important thing other than beer? Fried food.  And there's is amazing!  Fried zucchini was d'lish!  I also noticed that they had a ton of games on the other side of the bar that I didn't have a chance to check out.  I have only been once so far but I can guarantee it won't be my last !  It's about to be cruiser season and you better believe I'll be recruiting friends to ride cruisers over, eat amazing fried food, drink beers and play games!  Let's get the fall/winter kicked off right! Am I right? :)

I went out of my comfort zone trying this place out.  Pink Polish is out of the way for me and I just needed a quick pedi.  I was already in the area and in Tempe Marketplace so I figured it would just be a quick in and out process....wrongo.  Walking in the place was packed, but only in the back for the pedi chairs.  I thought this was strange until I saw that they do mani/pedi at the same time.  This is something I have seen before however, they carried around floor lamps from chair to chair.  That was new.  The pedi chairs were so close together but I ignored it and moved on with my pedi.  The nice thing was they were all very friendly, but lacked any professionalism at all.  The girl doing my toes and the guy next to me gossiped the entire time, to be honest that didn't bother me because they were speaking in English so I was still comfortable.  The part that I did NOT like was while she was in the middle of my pedi she spit her gum into a piece of paper....that they use to put between clients toes.  GROSS!  New/used....still gross.  That made me very uneasy about the sanitation in that salon.  Especially staring at all of the cleaning bottles just sitting right on top of their stations.  Most places tend to put them away after using them.  They had their "kits" all over the floor and sitting throughout the salon.  Girls working in their heels were stepping over and around them.  Can't be safe for client or techs I would imagine.    The only upside to this place was the length of the foot massage.  I swear it seemed like it was 20min long!  I'm bummed at the uncleanliness because the massage was stellar!  Convenience does not always outweigh everything.  My advice, skip it.

Everybody loves Daily Does!  The lines say that every Saturday and Sunday morning.  The food is much more fresh than any breakfast joint I have been to.  It's in a great spot in Old Town too!  Also, their pretzel buns...LOVE.

Anyone with furbabies knows that it can be difficult to leave your pups behind whether it be a week or two days.  When I moved here 3years ago I was traveling and had to find a place that I could comfortably leave my pups in while I was gone.  Finding this in a new city with no one to make suggestions was very stressful (I didn't Yelp at that time).   I found this place because it was close to where I lived at the time and it popped up on Google.  I went in for a tour and they walked me around and showed me the different Kennels and rooms you could put the pups in.  The entire staff is very friendly and the establishment itself is very clean and well-kept.   They have a few different kennels to chose from as well as a groomer in house.  The groomer introduced herself to me and discussed the different cuts she could do to make my mal-shi as cute as can be ! :)  I loved this because now I can do everything at one place and feel good about where I'm taking them !   Something else they have that I absolutely love is the puppy daycare.  They watch to see how your animal's temperament is with the other dogs, which is great!  That made me feel confident that they ensure every dog can be there and I didn't have to stress about their safety.  They are always consistent in checking the current status of your pets vaccinations to prevent any issues whether it be from your pet or other clients.   Every time I come in they always remember my pups and myself and that is a great feeling because you want to feel like they know your furry family!  I will even drive out of my way when I have the time to spare to purchase Blue Buffalo for my babies here just to support the business.  Overall this is a great place you can trust and leave your babies while you're out of town or for the day for daycare when it's too hot out!

I couldn't tell you how the food is which is unfortunate. I placed an order for carry out on their website that told me it would take an hour. I thought it was strange, but I waited and headed out with 15min to spare. On my way I got a call from the girl working the front desk asking if I was going to be coming to pick up my order. After I explained the time frame I received from the site she then told me it was still on daylight savings. Uh.......  So I of course asked if it had been sitting out a long time and if it would be cold and soggy. "Uh, well...let me ask my manager if we can make you a new order". I waited 5min on hold for her to tell me her manager said no, but they strill asked if would I be coming.  To pick up my order she basically just told me was cold and disgusting? They had to be kidding.  I opted out and headed to the best fall back anyone could ask for....buffalo wild wings!

I followed Roger Montoya here, he does the best anyone ever has with my hair ! I get bored very easily so I am always wanting something different. Roger changes it up for me without me having to go too into detail. He pleasantly surprises me every time ! (For a woman this is VERY impressive.) If you are looking for a hairdresser and like to keep up with current techniques/styles he is the greatest ! :)

No food? Who gives a crap. No hard liquor? Go next door. The bar tenders are rad and knowledgeable. I am down with beer or wine so I am happy with the choices.   Although I enjoy the occasional beer I am still attempting to expand my pallet. I look to the bar tenders at joints like this to help me learn a bit more about what they have and what I will potentially like. Out of the two dudes I've met here, they're happy to do that.  That is much appreciated.   Out of the few times I've been here I have never gotten hungry. However, I have been in when others have and they are happy to help. By providing take-out menus.  I mean, the place is tiny as crap. You want food? Call this number, you can take-out eat in Taste of Tops!  They have a large selection of beer and the taps have changed every time I have been in. I like that. When I have found beers I liked but aren't on tap any more it has beens in the massive case along the back wall.   So for those who complain about no food....man up. Drink beer, fuhget about it! This is the perfect spot to mellow out for happy hour.   Just don't come in expecting something fancy. Well...i'd hope you wouldn't, it's next to a liquor store for cryin out loud. It's dark. Small. Decent bar size. A few couches. Perfect for what it is.   Check it out. You're welcome.

Service was fabulous here, our server was super friendly and attentive. The food was delicious and our group of 11 was happy with where we landed, especially after the poor experience we had at the first restaurant we tried that night. o.O The food was delicious and the place was PACKED. In reality it is in a great spot so of course there is going to be a lot of foot traffic. They made room for our large group and were very accommodating, our starving group was appreciative!

The outside of this place is not what I call, "welcoming".  But I took the plunge and walked on in and boy was I glad that I did!  The place was a lot cleaner than what the outside lead me to believe it would be.  I mean, there's bars on the windows gimme a break.    I went on a Sunday and apparently that's one of the busiest days of the week there.  I only waited about 5-10min before they put me in the chair for my pedi.  Right after I sat down the people started pouring in and the wait times got longer and longer.  At one point they were at an hour wait.  Whoa.   My pedi was great and right after I moved over into the station for nails.  The woman got my hands ready for the next who would be doing the design on my nails.  I picked out a pretty funny design because hey, it's SHARK WEEK!  She kind of giggled and she dominated the design!  I couldn't have been happier with the great job she did.    It's close by my house and they did a good job.  I will be a frequent flier. :)

Man, I love this place. Seriously.   The decor is awesome.  The huge wingback chairs.  Bench seats.  Leather couches.  Chandeliers.  The wallpaper.  The nook where the band plays up front.  The bar.  Heck, even the people are pretty. ;)  I love their pretzel bites and the meat and cheese boards.  All delicious.  I had a bite of the meatloaf and I gotta tell ya, didn't love it.  I'm honestly not a huge meatloaf fan so I'm not a great judge, but I didn't even feel that the green beans were very delicious.  (That's okay by me though, I would never order the meatloaf.)  I had the red blend of the wine and it was really yummy, my friends all did mixed drinks or beer - all were satisfied.    There has only two things I was dissatisfied with in the two times I've been.  1.) Convenience of parking...(just valet).  2.) The service on my second visit was terrible.  There were 6-7 of us all having cocktails, but not loud by any means.  Our waiter wanted nothing to do with us.  He failed to explain that the meet and cheese that my two friends ordered would be on one plate.  Typically that WOULD be self explanatory, unless two people order it separately not sitting next to one another.  That was awkward when one person ate the food for two people.  When asking for the other individuals food the waiter rolled his eyes and quickly explained they were both obviously served on one board.  Could have been good information to know ahead of time.  My only point from my rant is, if you don't want to deal with groups in social settings serving may not be the occupation for you.  As a friendly group of people we're never a pain to serve and are always happy to tip! :)  I have no doubt I will be back to Culinary, maybe I'll give the one in Phoenix a try - it looks like it has a pretty cool vibe to it. :)

The good reviews surprise me...honestly.  I popped in here because it's nearby my house and it's open late.  I typically go to Pink Polish and eventually I'll learn to just KEEP going there!   I had "Tim the Nail Man" as he calls himself.  He was friendly enough and open to my design suggestions which is HUGE in my book.  Hence, two stars.  The only thing I didn't like as far as a nail tech goes was that he didn't wipe the shellac away from the edges of my nail.  Once it hardened it actually went a little onto my skin which is weird and somewhat uncomfortable. As I said, the designs were cute - I told him what I wanted nail by nail and he was happy to do whatever I suggested. =)  It's in the dark corner right by pranksters and a second hand store.  I wouldn't personally call it cozy myself.  The inside was not well-kept.  There were a few gnats over by the pedi station so I just skipped that option all together.  And while I was getting my nails done there was an ant on the towel under my hands.  He brushed it away.....thank you?    So, the two upsides.  1) The nail designs I requested turned out well.  2) They had 'My Best Friends Wedding' on the TV.   For how friendly Tim was I wish that it as a little cleaner in there.  Sanitary nail salons is IMPORTANT when they are poking you with tools.  The tools were not pulled from those plastic bags you've seen so you don't know the cleanliness of those when the establishment itself was not clean.  I will not be returning to this salon.

There's not a lot to say about Bosa.  It's delicious, it's cheap and convenient.  Their coffee is also surprisingly great too !  I am an avid donut eater and I have to say this is right up there next to Krispy Kreme!  Even when the drive-thru is super backed up they're always very speedy and you never wait too long.  I'm nervous and happy that I moved right next to one.  Look out bikini season!

The duce has been on my list of must-try's for months now! I was so glad I finally checked it out, but also glad I waited until the weather cooled off a bit!   This is a throwback, retro, hip...kind of spot. It can be kind of confusing if you're not with someone who has been at least once before. I walked into the part of the building where you can buy clothes/accessories. There are tables and some kind of smoothie spot to your left and a boxing ring in the back. See what I mean by confusing? Aside from not knowing where to go, it is in a very conspicuous spot so it could be easy to pass and somewhat of a challenge for parking.  We poked our heads around the corner and it looked to be just a hang out and someone was celebrating a birthday. Finally I asked the girl behind the cash register where we could order food.  She explained a bit about the place and showed us around. I appreciated that and further confirmed my confusion statement assuming others had felt the same way before. ;)   The patio is GREAT! Mismatched retro chairs, wooden picnic tables, hanging records and who could forget the silver trailer they serve food from?!  It took a minute to find the menu because she pointed around to random things and said, "menu is written all over the place" and that was it. Well, she was right...it's written on old tattered doors and wooden fence. Finally we went and asked for a real one..much better.  We got the meatball sliders and strawberry pecan salad. Both were DELICIOUS! Drinks were served in a glass coke bottle and what other than a mason jar. Cute.   Now being somewhat familiar with the way things work I look forward to returning. Combination of good food, good weather and great atmosphere I can't wait to take someone who's never been. This is definitely an experience.(:

Divaz is a great boutique!  I love this place because the girls that work here are so friendly and the store is clean and easily accessible.  This location is my favorite because it's more accessible than the one on Mill, I hate worrying about parking.  Tempe Marketplace has PLENTY of parking!  The clothes are a great price and the quality doesn't reflect the low cost at all.  They also have great jewelry and shoes in the store at all times as well.  I think the primary reason I like this store is because it is unique.  They have different inventory every visit so I feel much more confident other girls won't be wearing the same outfit. :)  If you're a fan of quality and current fashion this is a great place to visit!

Ken's was overcrowded and VERY small.  I went because there are a lot of great reviews about this place and after stepping foot in here I don't get it ?  They were friendly enough but a cramped space and too many dang people I can't ignore for good customer service.  The pedi chairs were so close together it looked uncomfortable.  I don't want to be in a forced position to actually converse with my neighbor.  I was glad that I just got a gel mani.  They don't have any seats side by side so my friend and I were sitting very far away from one another....texting. -_-  My nails came out okay, I did not request a design because I felt it was too risky.  Overall, I won't be back because I just didn't like the space to be honest.  One day I'll find a nail place that is within a reasonable distance to my house.  Until then...Pink Polish I go.

In town for a company retreat and a party of 11, we walked in excited for lots of drinks and some much needed food. We sat down at the table that was set up for us in the center of the floor and waited for our server. After about 10 minutes of waiting (it was slow) and no water, she came over for drink orders. We put in an order for 6-7 different appetizers and proceeded to make her aware of our Yelp discounts for buy one get one. At this point she directs us to the bar to order our drinks, "that will take me 20 minutes, you'll need to make your order at the bar and show them your voucher and stormed off. I don't know about you, but it seems a tad unrealistic for 11 people to make their way to the bar to place a drink order. Hence, the reservation. I'd a also like to point out we were not splitting the bill, this would all be on one check.  Seems like a good opportunity for some $$$$, right?  The owner of our company made his way to the front to speak with a manager. He had to wait behind another very unsatisfied customer who was speaking with the manager about the service received. (Bad sign eh?)   He came back to the table, we waited for 5 minutes and no one addressed our concerns or apologized.   Our group of 11 stood up and made our way to Cabo Wabo. Needless to say this was a very poor experience, I would not recommend it (especially to a group).

A group of us went here for a friends 30th birthday.  What a great choice !   The waiter that we had was very knowledgeable, fun and super friendly ! Gary I believe it was. :)  None of us had been there before so we were more than impressed with the atmosphere.  Very quaint and classy.  We all ordered a variety of appetizers and we not disappointing!  Fondue, hummus and olive plate.  All were very delicious and plenty for 7 to share.  As far as dinner goes I can only speak for my boyfriend and myself as we took a bite of one anothers entree (Scallops and Meatloaf).  The scallops and grits were PHENOM!!  I am from the south so I was a bit weary about trying grits in Scottsdale, but they did not let me down :)  Meatloaf I didn't have much to compare to but it was pretty good and my boyfriend loved it.   If you're looking for a fun evening out with good food and drinks this is a place you don't want to pass up.  It's not somewhere I would find myself on a weekly basis, but I will be back!

Okay so this is your stereotypical Old Town Scottsdale night club.  One caveat....they shoot confetti into the sky from little guns.  Alright, I'm hooked.   It's over crowded. And I don't mean with just people in general.  I mean sweaty, overly intoxicated, overly "friendly" d's.    You have to expect that going into a place where you'll wait in line for 45min if you don't have breasts, right?  But again....the confetti.   They have chicks that dance on the bar running around with a whistle and a bottle of liquor pouring shots into whomever is brave enough to step up to the bar.  (This girl on her birthday! - no judgement needed.)  Note to self: this liquid they pour into your mouth taste more like battery acid rather than actual alcohol, but hey, it's the experience.  I have never even considered eating here being that I only force my friends into this establishment for special occasions.....or nights we've been over poured and feel like Superman.    On my birthday we ventured in here for 30min-1hr.  Enough time for a drink or two and a couple confetti showers. Heaven.  If you haven't been I recommend at least going once to really experience a real "unce unce" night in Old Town.  It will be everything you imagined.  That is if you imagine things such as: sticky floors, tight shirts on men, girls with tube socks on bars, overly gel'd - spiked hair, tight/short dresses, long lines (outside and inside), ear drum bursting bass and CONFETTI.   You're welcome.

I actually worked here for a short time when I moved from Kentucky. It was brand new and the staff was so friendly! I found pretty quickly serving wasn't for me, but that happens. Javier was the most fun! He is such a friendly character and it's definitely better to visit when he's around.(: the owners are super friendly and accommodating when they can be. I still take people here when I know they enjoy good home cooked food. Especially my family when they're in from Kentucky. My favorite thing is the chili and cornbread. The cornbread is so delicious it is close to cake! The stuffed poblano also was delicious...not sure if it's still around. I can't say enough great things. Oh, an the view and bar are fantastic as well (;

I recently moved in to Tempe from south Scottsdale so I am on the hunt of some delicious breakfast spots. Mark's did not disappoint. Remember the show Cheers? That is basically this place. The staff are so friendly it was actually amazing! The dog friendly patio was a big perk as well because I love taking my fur baby to hang out with me when I can.   As far as the food goes I had biscuits and gravy and they were delish. Very stick to your ribs, good. My cute little date had a chocolate chip pancake that was bigger than her tiny head. (She's 3 so her head is pretty tiny.) The pancake was very yummy as well.   This is a place that I will revisit without hesitation and even if there is a line outside don't expect to wait around long. They're very quick and the food is worth a quick 15min wait.

We went there because it looks laid back and the music was good.  I was most excited for the street tacos.  I'm pretty sure they didn't drain the meat before slopping it into the corn tortillas.  In turn they broke and were soggy. A complete MESS.  We also ordered some chicken nachos which were less than par.  We took a bite of each taco and less than two chips off the pile. We left hungry and annoyed. A bummer because the inside of the place had a great feel.  I would go here if you're looking to enjoy chips, salsa, and a beer.  If you want good street tacos you are better off at a roach coach.

Haven't been to Thirsty Lion?  You're missin out!  This place is the best in TMP right next to Bar Louie.  Thirsty Lion is a quality pub with fabulous food and customer service.  I don't think I've ever had the same thing twice in this place, just doesn't seem right!  I will say the sliders are delicious as well as the nachos!  (My favorites so far.)  The atmosphere is great in here because it's not too loud, it's huge and it's right next to everything.  I recommend going here when you don't feel like going out for a crazy night of beers or a good place to start the evening.  Either way, if you haven't been....go.  :)

I had heard so many great things about this place and I'm glad I finally went! The atmosphere is kickback and fabulous. My girlfriend and I hung at the bar and our bartender ROCKED. I tend to be very picky when trying new beer and he was very patient in giving me samples and educating me on all the beers. We didn't eat so I cannot comment on the food, but I will be back and I'm doubting I will be disappointed! (: Looking forward to taking my beau along for the next visit!

Well, I think everyone covers the initial basics pretty well....  You arrive, you're given your key to your locker which holds your giant robe and flip flops, you sit in the comfortable waiting room (with complimentary snacks, tea and water) and then...you are called back in to the lovely room of zen.   Pick your poison...sugar scrub, lomi lomi, salt scrub, and so on and so on...they have SO MANY options! After my first experience I was hooked. I immediately signed up for a membership because I knew I would return. Which I have, over...and over. I gave the lomi lomi a try as suggested and it was not my cup of tea. I'm sure that if I had loosened up I would have enjoyed the session much more, but I prefer the sheet and the coverage. I believe they call what I get, the more traditional, the Numi? I stick with that so that I get the most from my sessions, fullllll relation. :)   Zach is a fantastic therapist and when scheduling I do my best to make my way in when he is available. He is good about going through my chart and asking about any focus areas.  The staff here is always fantastic and welcoming. There have been a couple times I've called in about different services, completely lost on what to book and they have been amazingly patient and happy to educate me on their offerings!   The contract that you sign for a membership lasts for 12 months. There were a few months that I needed to take off from the payments and I called in to ask questions. They were very understanding and provided me with instructions on how to put in a request. I emailed the owners, the request was approved and they payments were put on hold for 4 months. Very accommodating and customer service driven.   I will continue to return and recommend friends to check it out!

I've had this spot bookmarked for a while, it's like a little lost gem.  When I say little I really do mean LITTLE!  We drove past the building 3 times and eventually just had to follow the dot on the map to ask the valet  if we were in the right spot.  So, note to self: when you're on the prowl for this place just look for the little owl eyes...or maybe it's a woodpecker. :-p  I have only been twice, once on a Friday and then on a Saturday.  Both nights were completely packed.  It's quaint and a great crowd, a nice change from the Old Town Scottsdale scene.  They have tons of games in the back: foosball, skiball and something else I can't remember. ;)    Something totally random that I noticed and thought was super cute, they give the checks back in these little black books.  Not sure why that was one of the things I liked most.  I'm sure at some point I'll venture back out this way, cab ride from here to Scottsdale isn't bad and the drinks aren't overpriced.

Really liked this place! Very quaint and cozy inside. Our server was awesome and made recommendations which was greatly appreciated. They have a large menu and everything looks delicious.  I ordered the pulled pork scramble and my girlfriend had the black bean cakes. My dish was very tasty! The pork was sweet and with a little hot sauce it was over. Let the "sport eating" commence. My friend did not care for the cakes, but I thought they were pretty decent. I personally enjoy meat too much for a veggie dish though. ;)   They have pictures of the evolution of Dottie's which is cute. They have $7 mimosas which was tempting along with the cinnamon roll French toast. Well, I guess it looks like I know what I want when I return.   Great breakfast spot, not too packed, no wait, perfect!

You'll see from my reviews I have tried out a NUMBER of nail salons in the valley. Up until recently I had only found one I really liked that would do the funky designs I like, but it's 20+min away. I've heard a lot of mixed reviews about Teres but I had to see for myself.  I called Sunday morning and was able to get in for a gel mani that afternoon. The interior is gorgeous, very laid back - not like annoying spa music though. All of the techs were very friendly, I can't remember the name of mine unfortunately.   They have a 'bar tab' that you make selections for what services you want, kind of like an a' la carte menu. She was very nice about explaining it and not just blowing through the details. It could be very easily complicated if not explained so I appreciated her going through it.  I asked for matte black which they did not have the top coat to do it yet. So she worked with me and filed it by hand and they look matte - awesome.   The pedi station was very cute, but it's more of a bench so no massage chair. I'm not sure if the bench had been full how comfortable it would've been sitting that close to other people. Then again, I like my massage chair and my own space.  Although I may not be back for a pedi I WILL be back for my nails. Finally, a nail place within 2 miles of my house! :)

You get what you pay for is the best way to describe this place.  We made the mistake of waiting until Memorial Day Weekend to get our mani/pedis and EVERYTHING was booked.  We tried to push them to their creative limits which were just not what we were looking for unfortunately.  The women working were plenty nice I just prefer a little more.....quirk.    It's been a week and my nails are chipping and have the little "crackle" on the tips.  I do the gel mani's so they typically last me for anywhere from 3-4 weeks!  I'm disappointed, but not surprised.  I will forever travel to Pink Polish in Chandler for my favorite girls to do my mani/pedis! :)

Rehab is in a great location and atmosphere!  We were looking to grab some food before heading out into Scottsdale for the day and fell into here.  The patio is cute and the inside has a great beachy feel.  A girlfriend of mine got the Veggie Noogie and loved the crunch from the sprouts.  I on the other hand went with the Venice Beach Club.  Note to self: IT'S HUGE!!!  It was a double stacked sandwich that was hard for me to even bite into, but I'll be completely honest...it was DELICIOUS!  Our other friends went for the massive burgers which they both loved the pretzel buns.  Seems that's what everyone raves about so I'm not too surprised.  The only thing that I was kinda bummed about was the beer.  All of our beers were luke warm.  I like my beer so cold it hurts my teeth so it was hard to ignore that it was warm.    Other than that this place was great!  I will absolutely go back and take family/friends when they are in town from home.  How could you not love it ?!  I felt like I was on vacation. :)

I have heard about this place since I moved out here in October of 09', I decided enough was enough....it was time !   It's so tucked away downtown I actually drove past it.  It was about 9PM on a Wed. and inside all tables were packed.  The patio was actually great and I like that they have all drinks written on a chalkboard as opposed to using just menus. I had a red blend of wine which was really yummy, similar to a Cabernet.   The only thing I wasn't that thrilled about was their food selection.  I'm not sure why, but nothing really caught my eye.  We ordered "the mess" and shared between the three of us.  Brown gravy, cheese curds and fries.  They were pretty good, but I thought the gravy left little to be desired.    The thing that would keep me coming back would have to be the mellow vibe and man, I loved that patio.  I will eat before and be happy to quench my thirst on a flight of beers. :)  Want something low key, but a great atmosphere...this is it.

I really liked this place a lot.  The guy working was really friendly and helpful, let me see as many pieces that I wanted.  Prices are great and everything is locally made.  To be honest the two things that made this place were the guy working and the fact that everything is local.  The shop was clean, the guy was knowledgeable.  I will definitely be back.

I  purchased the groupon for this gym for the ultd workouts for the month for $40. I have never actually enjoyed or looked forward to working out so this was a shot in the dark. I am so happy I did!  As other reviews mention every workout is completely different and very fast paced. I never go in feeling intimidated or unsure because everyone is very open and willing to help one another out.   It doesn't smell like most gyms well, its not at all like any gym I've been to. This will be my third week coming up and I go 5 days a week.  I'm looking forward to keeping it up and really seeing the results.  I sweat WAY too much not to. ;) You WILL be sore because they push you to your limits. But you will walk out feeling so happy you challenged yourself and kicked some butt!  This is now something I look forward to throughout the week rather than dreading. I suggest all ladies check it out, even if for the free week. (:

This bar is unlike any other that I've been to on Mill.  Most bars on Mill either smell or make you feel too old if you're out of college.  This is a great laid back feel with a nice atmosphere to just hang and have a bite with a beer.    They have a lot of good munchies on the menu along with a huge beer selection.  My favorite as far as food goes?  The pretzels with cheese! Mmmmm!  The beer menu is large, but not so large you feel overwhelmed like World of Beer down the street.    They have a nice patio that I enjoyed drinking on many times in the spring. :)  But the inside isn't bad either, the bar area is pretty big and the tables in the back are cool if you're with a group.  Parking is to be desired.  I mean, it's on Mill so you can't really have high expectations as far as parking goes.  For that I do not fault them. :)  If you are near by and haven't tried this place I highly recommend it, especially if you aren't much on the Mill scene.

I won't lie, it's possible I've been here too many times.  The first time I experienced Bar Louie was at home in Newport, KY on the Ohio River.  This has no city skyline or boats going by, but it is still pretty great!  My favorite thing on the drink menu by FAR is the bloody mary!  If you're into Bloody's you will love this one, it's like a meal in a glass. (=    In terms of food I never really branch out from what I know.  The chicken nachos are pretty great, but they changed the cheese which made them...pretty decent.  The pretzel dipper thingy's are thee bomb dot com!  My boyfriend and I recently ventured out into the world of Bar Louie sliders.  They were surprisingly d'lish!  All in all, I think this is a great place to kick back in TMP and have a drink or three.  It's possible I may be a little bias because it's somewhat of home away from home, but I would still recommend you try it out ! :)

This HomeGoods is the closest one to me in the Valley so whenever I'm looking for something new for my home I tend to gravitate here.  It's very clean and the inventory is always great.    The set up is easy to navigate (lamps, pillows, garden, knick-knacks, etc).   My least favorite thing to do is rummage (unless I'm in a thrift store) and this HomeGoods does not force any rummaging on you!  The quality of the clearance items is hit and miss, but you can usually snag at least one good find for a good rate.  The employees are usually pretty nice, I've had the people help me out in carrying things to my car.   Parking is solid here being that it's in a shopping center.  Overall, this is a great place when you want some items for your home that are good quality and good rates.  I'd say if this is in your area, or even a bit out, check this spot out.  Everyone loves HomeGoods.

This is a cute little spot and much different than what I expected.  It has the laid back vibe of a BBQ joint, but with a dash of class. :)  It was my first time there and unfortunately I had already eaten dinner.    Although I had already eaten I was not too shy to pick off of a friends plate. He had some sort of pork shank with mashed potatoes and kale, the kale was amazeballs!!!  I tried a bite of the snapper and just before I say something, I don't really care for fish.  The snapper wasn't fishy and had a lot of great flavor.  For those who don't typically eat fish let me warn you....it still had a head....like, with eyes and lips. :-o (similar to that.)  The bartender just so happened to also be....one of the owners. :)  He was very knowledgeable when it came to wine, mixing drinks, whiskey, bourbon...truthfully, I think he just knows his alcohol.  He was really friendly and chatty, but not too chatty. ;)  He made my friends a few mixed drinks recommended by him, they loved them all.  I stuck with the wine because I know I enjoy that stuff every time.   Overall, it was a great experience it's too close to my house to not go back for a nice happy hour.  I recommend if you haven't been to at least try it out for some drinks and munchies.

Union makes me think of an upscale flea market.  Is that weird? Meh, to each their own.  It's a great addition to this mall, I think it needed a little "hip" flare.  This is it !  There are a lot of hipsters and great locally owned shops, locally owned is what makes it what it is.   A bunch of upscale boutiques put under one roof? Genius.  The bike store has to be my favorite.  Everything is on the more expensive side, but you have to somewhat expect that at the Biltmore Mall right?  There are great places with knick-knacks for your home, also pricy.  But it's super fun to walk through and if anything you can pick up some inspiration.   There is a restaurant that I cannot remember the name for the life of me, but it's a little cafe at the very end of the "strip".  I have gone twice on Saturday afternoon's and it's never overly crowded, or crowded at all.  That is not to say that their food and drinks are not delicious.  Because they are. :) I've had the mimosa and the Caesar salad, both were great!  Caesar salad was very crunchy which is my favorite, I hate when it's soggy.   I definitely like Union and will be back, I especially like that I can park for free for the first two hours.  If I go over that it's because I've had too many cocktails.

I've only been to spokes a few times after softball games, with groups and just two of us at a time.  I love their patio, the music has been really loud each time I've been so it's nice to be outside to just hang.  The servers are always very friendly and the atmosphere is very laid back.  (Perfect for after a sporting event and a rowdy group.)  Their wings are good....the queso on the other hand....pass.  It was crusty within like 10min, yuck.  The beer selection is good, limited to local breweries so don't expect Blue Moon or Coors...they have the good stuff!  The servers are very knowledgable and happy to hang and explain the different types and bring samples.  All in all, it's a great spot to hang and try a few new beers.  I'll be back when I'm on this side of town. :)

My girlfriends and I were looking for a place with good food and a good vibe.  The cab let us out and not 2min later we were running back to catch it.  There's a good chance we should have given it more of a try...  There were people that appeared to be in their late 60's flooding out of the restaurant. Now, I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that but a couple hot ladies looking to have some fun....not so much.  It looked pretty cute on the inside maybe it was someone's birthday or a celebration...  There's a possibility I'll go back one day, I may wait a few decades.  Unless someone convinces me otherwise. :)

I have been to Salut two different times.  The first time was for happy hour with a group of girlfriends and the second for mimosas.  Happy hour was great as far as drinks and the munchies.  They have a great outdoor patio that opens up into the dining room AND it's pet friendly - always a plus!  The service was great both times I went.  Absenthe is their "thing" however, I did NOT care for it.  But it is an awesome experience to share with friends and it's only $5...deal.  As far as the mimosas...eh.  I've had better.  They were made with some kind of concentrate and it was much more O.J. than it was champagne.  That will make for quite the harsh heart burn...yikes.  Again service was KILLER so I was still pleasantly surprised.  I also had the 'meaty' omelet....it was d'lish!  They do not let your mimosa even begin to get low before they're back filling it up again...although, I attribute that to the fact that they're primarily O.J.  Eh, oh well!  I'll stick to the happy hour ! =)

Went here Friday evening after work for happy hour around 630-7ish.  We ended up liking the atmosphere and posted up until like 11PM!  The music they played was actually pretty good, not ALL country music.  The crowd was interesting, 25-30 somethings with a few 50's sprinkled in the mix.  There was the normal Scottsdale crowd...you know, bedazzled jeans/belt buckles, shmedium sized shirts.  Then there were your random camo wearing cowboy hats.  And just your average people.  So it was a nice mix and definitely some great people watching.    We had the Chips and Dip for $7.  It was.....bleh.  The chips were soggy and lip so in order to get the dip onto the chip you had to use a fork and fold it over. Eh.....  On a good note our bar tender was awesome !  She was super attentive (even once it got packed) and funny!  She made killer drinks and chatted it up with us ladies, and if you're a lady...you know that can be quite rare.    Another interesting thing is their band is above the bar.  So, if you're sitting at the bar you just see flailing arms, the end of a guitar and the occasional hair flip.  The band on Friday was not too great so we preferred the DJ over the live brand which is surprising.  The later it got into the evening the longer the line got leading up to the door.  When I go back again I will be doing it the same way I did (happy hour into the night), I don't foresee myself waiting in line to get in.   I am looking forward to going back and sitting at a booth with a little mini tap and ordering some beer and kicking back.  Maybe having food with a little more substance in hopes that it's yummier than the Chips and Dip.  I will definitely be back to this bar!

A great, random find - thanks Yelper's! A family owned shop where everyone is friendly. They were quick and the work was quality. I can't remember what the "dad's" name was, but he did my fill and reshape and was very nice and did a great job! Tiffany finished me up with a paint a subtle design, she was also very nice. If it weren't so far out of my way I would be back.

My friends and I just left the Phoenix Open and after a long day of walking all we were looking forward to was sitting down for some food and cold drinks.  We hadn't planned on that taking an hour and a half so that was really unfortunate.  When we came in we decided to sit at a booth because it was pretty chilly out.  It wasn't too busy, but we only counted 3 servers.  I think that was what caused the majority of our problems...  It took our waitress like 10 minutes before she came over to greet us with our bottle of water and glasses.  Because it took a while for her to came over we ordered drinks and chips and salsa.  Drinks took another 15 minutes so by the time they came we had already finished with our chips and were so hungry we almost ate the paper.    Two of our friends ordered the tacos which they said were decent.  I ordered the tinga burrito bowl.  Luckily the meat was good because the black eyed peas were an awkward addition and the rice was hard.  My other friend ordered the nachos (with no meat) which also had the strange black eyed peas and some cheese sprinkled on them.  So unfortunate the food was a flop. Bland.  She didn't come back to check on us very often and we noticed two other tables complaining from the same issue, different server.  Seems like they were understaffed and it impacted the service in a BAD way.    It's unfortunate we didn't like it here because we were excited about the new location and the cool new look.  We left saying we wouldn't come back.  Hopefully after a while of being back up and running they will get things going a bit better, I'm not opposed to giving it another shot.

I found Joncen on Yelp about a year ago while I was temporarily staying in Chandler. I typically would not just point and shoot when picking someone new for my hair however, I had procrastinated to the point that I just HAD to have it done.   I explained my goals of growth and still remaining blonde and he got me scheduled and in the following weekend. Perfect!   He got my hair from a drab blonde lightened up, refreshed and balayaged. He got the top of my hair so close to my natural dirty blonde that I have not had to have my hair colored again since my first visit in February. WHAT! Amazing.   Not only is this inexpensive to upkeep, but my hair is 10x healthier (and growing!). He has put toner on only once and he keeps me in check with my 8 week appointments for my trims. (I need someone to hold me accountable for regular trims so this is perfect!)   He's very sweet and talented. Although I am back in Scottsdale I will continue going back for his fantastic work and advice. It's worth the drive for me (:

I have reviewed this gym at the N. Scottsdale location and the new Tempe location is definitely up to par! Great spot right off the highway and easy to find.   This one isn't as booked as the Scottsdale classes because it's brand new. It's still just as great for me because I thoroughly enjoy the workouts I get from Jabz. However, I'll be really excited when there are more girls coming in because it's a great motivator with other chicks who are looking to get in shape and kick some butt!   It's basically a VERY CHALLENGING circuit training with new exercises every visit. Keeps things fun and exciting so that you actually look forward to your workouts. I get bored so damn easy this is quite important for me.  Don't expect to come out feeling anything other than "man, I got my ass kicked". Len and the other trainers will work you and encourage you to do your best!   Ladies, don't be intimidated by my ass kicking remarks. It's fabulous. And your progress shows that. As I said, they're great motivators so I'm sure you will find you really enjoy it. I purchased visits on groupon and just stuck with it since.   Victory is mine!

I left work on a mission to find an early, delicious and NOT fast food lunch. Yelp, as usual, came to my rescue. Desert Rays is tucked away alongside a few other places and the jumbo sized gym next door. As I walked in I was greeted by everyone working, it felt like Cheers...but newer and in North Scottsdale. :)   I hung out at the bar to place my order and the man working was super friendly. I picked up a burrito and the Desert Ray's pancake plate....not sure on the names. My buddy at work loved his burrito and the pancakes were GIGANTIC. For the quick experience I had it was definitely a good one. Although I live in Tempe I'm sure I will be back. Although next time I will sit at the bar and have a bloody mary with my brunch instead of a water.

I actually came across M3V through an event that Yelp help a couple of weeks ago. I was thrilled with the concept. I mean, who wouldn't be? Pampering and a complimentary glass of..wine, sangria, cappuccino - you name it!   This weekend I went back with a girlfriend, I was there for a manicure and her a pedicure. They were very thoughtful in trying to place us as close to one another as they could, I was appreciative of that. The overall service was good, very relaxing. There was a very nice woman walking around giving massages (shoulders/back for mani's, hands/arms for pedi's) for $10/min. I was feeling good and relaxed so I figured, meh...let's go for it! The massage was great and I think at one point I was very close to melting in my seat.   I love the relaxing, welcoming vibe of M3V. The overall manicure was your typical manicure, the gel selection was fairly large so I was able to find something I was happy with. This is a place that I will visit every now and then, not necessarily my bi-weekly upkeep. Not because I didn't care for it, but because $45 for my manicure is a bit more than I would like to spend on a frequent basis. When I am looking for a relaxing girls date I will keep M3V in mind!

This is a great place to post up at the bar for pizza and a GREAT selection of beer. It's very quaint with a fun atmosphere. I love that it's tucked away in old town away from all the hot spots.  Don't get me wrong it was plenty busy, but I love that it feels hidden.   They have a great patio, but when we visited it was way too hot to enjoy it. (I will be venturing back when it's not as hot as the surface of the sun.)   We ordered a pepperoni pizza and it was delicious! I was so glad they suggested it. Not only because it was delicious, but we needed some carbs at this point in the days adventures.    They have a fantastic selection of local beers on tap. From what I understood, they're all local. Like most places we were able to sample and check it out beforehand...each were delicious. Our group went from IPA to porter and none of them disappointed.   Staff was stellar, very friendly and knowledgable (always a plus). Overall, a great experience and we will be back! :) check it out you won't be disappointed.
