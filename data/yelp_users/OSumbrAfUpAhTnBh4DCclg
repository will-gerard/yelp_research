The worst service ever.  We were sat and then ignored.  Two tables came in after us, one on either side of us and they got drinks and chips & salsa.   Needless to say, we walked out.

The first time I went was with my kids who are very picky.  They loved the chicken strips and the sweet potato fries.  I tried a chicken sandwich because I had just had a burger for lunch, it was great with lots of yummy toppings.  I tried a bite of my husbands burger which is why we went back a second time; I had to get one of my own.   Join their email club and they will send you a BOGO offer right away.
