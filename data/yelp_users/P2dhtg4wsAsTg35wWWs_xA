This is a old favorite! I have been coming here since I was in High School and I am never disappointed. Fried rice and the fan favorite Orange Chicken are amazing

I couldn't have been happier with the service, the response and the pricing. I called around to other competitors and Triple B was the least expensive and offered a lifetime warranty on the Spring with 3 year warranty on the labor. They were in and out the next day and within 20 minutes. Completely painless the whole way.

Fresh ingredients and taste! I love the food here and the price is great for what you are getting.   My one negative is consistency on the ZA can be off and sometimes it needs to be a little more crispy for all the yummy goodness to hold up.

Ordered online 7:26pm on a Wednesday. Called 8:33pm "I wanted to see if my online order came through?" "Yes, so sorry we were busy. Just called driver 8 minutes from you". Cool I thought, better for me they were busy and an hour and 10 minutes for delivery is not unheard of. 9pm comes, the time they are supposed to close and 20 minutes past when the quoted time was, I call again. No answer... 9:20pm comes I drive there.   Long story short bad beginning. They discounted and I got my food 2 hours later.  The food was decent but not worth it all and I would come off as bias if I wrote it out. Just beware I am not the first to mention delivery issues.

This is as good as it gets! They come to my office, I am that lucky, twice a week and while here most times I go back a second time. Nothing is better than helping a small business and a person pursuing their dreams than when you are doing it and it is amazing quality.
