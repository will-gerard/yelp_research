I have eaten at many Mediterranean Restaurants in Arizona, aside from other states and overseas. The Persian Room is, by far, one of the best in Arizona, if not The Best. You will find a mixed crowd there and it is as casual as you want it to be. From large parties celebrating an occasion, business meetings, families, couples and friends, everyone is welcome. Now back to the food...I have had several dishes including the Chicken Filet Sultani, Barg, Sultani, Naderi, and Gyros, and all were wonderful. All seasoned well and very tender. To start off, the Tah Dig (crispy rice) topped with Gheimeh stew is delicious. You can have that alone as a meal, but most parties start with this as an appetizer, along with Shirazi Salad. Most meals are served with Basmati Rice and you can choose Shirazi Salad to accompany it. If you go after 5pm, you will have the opportunity to try their freshly baked pita bread, as well. My absolute favorite entree is the Koobideh (seasoned ground beef and minced onions). It is the best I have ever had. Just be forewarned, the portions are large. So be prepared to take half your dish home, which is just as good the next day. All in all, the service is wonderful and the food is outstanding. If you have yet to try Mediterranean food, why not start with the best...OR try someplace else and then try The Persian Room to compare. You can thank me later. ;)

The Phoenicia Grill offers a mean Gyro sandwich that won't leave you disappointed and asking, "Where's the Beef?". The Chicken Shawarma (shawarma combo-yum!) is flavorful and my daughter loves it. Garlic sauce is the Best on pretty much everything. Wonderful Hummus and rice. A place where meat lovers and vegans can unite with a great menu and friendly staff that makes every visit a enjoyable! I Love Phoenicia Grill!

We went to San Tan Flat to give the steaks a try, as we had never ventured out that way and wanted to try something new. The place has a great atmosphere and resonates what a steakhouse in the southwest should be...even without my cowboy boots. After reading the menu and seeing they boast about the quality of steaks, we were really looking forward to trying them. Big disappointment...the steaks are not of the quality demanding for their prices. I had the ribeye, which was tenderized too much, it was flat. My husband had the New York steak that was lacking so much in flavor, he actually used A1 steak sauce (I have NEVER seen him use steak sauce...EVER)! My daughter had the flat iron steak, where I think if I dropped it on the floor, it would have bounced back up to the table! Great place to meet up for happy hour, but  way, way overpriced...what you're really paying for is the cowboy way atmosphere. Yee Haw!

I have been on a quest, since moving to Arizona, to find NY Style Pizza. Other places just add "NY Style" to their storefront, but fail to deliver. I tried 1 slice with Xtra cheese and meatballs...and I literally pictured myself walking in NYC eating a slice of NY Pizza. They delivered on their claim and the service was wonderful! Two thumbs way up!

If you have never been to Blue32, you have never had the Best Burger in Gilbert...oh Hell, in the Southeast Valley! I'm not talking about a burger with all the fixing's or smothered in mouth watering sauces. I'm talking about the taste and flavor of the burger alone! To me, a Burger is Good, when it doesn't need anything to make it better. Aside from my homemade burgers, these burgers are the BEST around! Tired of hearing about the Burgers? Blue32 is just a casual, great place to watch a game, have a Beer (or a few), and eat some delicious appetizers. The Hot Wings, Sliders, Chicken Quesadillas, Ahi Tuna, Calamari, and Onion Rings are all great, to name a few. The Tacos Al Carbon leave you wanting more and the Prime Rib Special (not on menu) was to die for! All in All, Blue32 is a great Sports Bar and Grill that specializes in serving quality food with friendly service. Two Thumbs Up...WAY UP! ;)

I had been looking for a Cat Groomer for quite a while. Had brought my Himalayan in to Petsmart (4 different locations) and Banfield Pet Hospital (and many others)...groomers came and went and then said they would not do him. My cat gets very stressed and is difficult to Groom. Jason from Aussie came over, picked him up and started petting him under his chin. My cat "Kasper" loved it and he usually hates men! I was very nervous, but Jason did an awesome job and he looks better than anyone else has done in the past! I love him and will be using them again. I am a very happy customer and it was well worth the cost, which was much, much less than what the Vet charged me. My grumpy cat is happy again! :)

Dawn with Critter Caretakers is wonderful! Not only is she an organized, professional, she truly cares for the animals as if they were her own. You can rest assured she will take care of your extended family while you are away and be provided daily updates via text or email. We have used her twice and will continue using the service going forward. Peace of mind is what we were looking for, and Critter Caretakers certainly delivers! I would gladly recommend  her services to any of my clients!

Can't beat the price! Spectrum Fitness is now only $10 a month (Cardio & Weights) or choose the Premier membership at $20 a month (I was grandfathered in) for all classes, pool usage and Unlimited Guests Pass (bring a friend everyday, if you want, just have them buy you lunch...hehe)...you also get access to the new Mesa location, with unlimited Tanning included (Yay!)! If you want to pay for country club amenities that you barely use and show off your new fitness clothes, go somewhere else.

WOW! I hesitantly tried Isabel's Amor Mexican Restaurant, located in the same plaza as Blue32 in Gilbert, because I was afraid of being disappointed. What an awesome surprise! For appetizer, we had Baja Shrimp Coctel (Ceviche) and it was delicious. Have not had it better anywhere else. For entree, I had Carnitas, thinking it would ok, but it blew me away! Unbelievable flavor! My husband had the Pescado De La Parrilla (Mahi Mahi) and it was fabulous! Service was wonderful, the manager came to our table to see how everything was and there is a Musician on Thursdays and every other Saturday. I have eaten at many Mexican restaurants in Arizona and this place will now be my Go-To Place! It is a more casual, upscale Mexican Restaurant with reasonable pricing that must be tasted!
