Very helpful staff. I walked in and apparently looked lost. Staff approached me and immediately directed me to where I needed to be! I was shocked bc I've experienced so much poor customer service in this city! This was a welcome change! :)

Horrible family practice. Dr Shilpa Gujrathi is a terrible physician who ignores your symptoms. You will end up waiting to be seen for nearly an hour and then receive subpar care. My suggestion- find a more reputable family practice. This one is terrible. You'll die if you truly have something that is terminal because they will not care enough to figure out what is wrong with you. Protect yourself, find a better doctor than the ones at this practice.

Been going here forever. Today they lost a string to my maternity shirt. Really disappointed. Time to change dry cleaners.

I'm not sure how great the spa is at this office, but the OB care was subpar.  Dr Harris neglected to place a cerclage (after it worked with our last one) and this resulted in us having a premature baby born at 29 weeks. Very disappointed and will not be going back with any future pregnancies. Is this practice actually a high risk OB GYN? I'm definitely skeptical of them having this title....

If I could give no stars, that would be more appropriate for this hospital. Poor customer service and I encountered not one friendly staff while here. Was seen in triage at the OB department and was not even seen by one doctor before being discharged home. Luckily it has turned out to be nothing severe otherwise, I will be the first to sue this terrible hospital. Thank goodness I will not be delivering at this place. I can't even begin to imagine the poor treatment I would receive after my experience here 2 days ago. Don't deliver your baby here.  Go to Banner Thunderbird if you are looking for somewhere close to this hospital.

Love this place! Cakes are beautiful and taste delicious! Staff is friendly and are very detail orientated! Reasonably priced too. We love this place. Ordered 2 cakes so far and we'll definitely be back for our next one :)

Bees are way too aggressive in AZ and we nearly got attacked by bees at this park. Be cautious here...you or your children risk getting stung.

Fabulous preschool. Our little boy loved going here! The teachers are warm and compassionate. Super friendly atmosphere! We recently transferred to the Primrose of Arrowhead because we moved and are very disappointed with the Arrowhead Primrose. Wish Primrose of Tatum were closer because we would definitely continue taking him to this location!

Fabulous Dermatologist! Very thorough with a compassionate and kind personality! A little far for me to drive but it was totally worth it! I can't say that for many medical offices in Arizona unfortunately....however, I love this place! Definitely recommend it.  It is worth the 4-6 week wait for an appointment.
