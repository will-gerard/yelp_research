What the hell happened to this place...maybe I'm being a stickler about a buffet but this is just depressing.  No fried calamari......All the food is cold at the start of dinner.  Crab legs are like dried up carrots...never again.

So far the best sushi I've had on the west valley.  Just moved from Tempe and was way better than most places on that side of town as well.  Can't beat the happy hour, the only complaint would be how small the place is and it get's busy so the wait can be brutal when you're so close to such great sushi.

I've ordered lots of chinese delivery since being in AZ. and this is place was actually surprisingly better than most.  I'm always hesitant when ordering from a new Asian restaurant from so many bad experiences here.  The lady on the phone was typical of any other Asian restaurant and very friendly.  Ordered orange beef, sweet and sour chicken and the shrimp vegetable,  all were really good surprisingly.  The orange beef is probably the best I've had from a delivery, could use a lil more spiciness.   Prices were better than most places as well.  Would order again.
