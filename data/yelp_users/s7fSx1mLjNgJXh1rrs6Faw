Gorgeous. Definitely worth a visit, especially with the Chihuly exhibit installations. I love this place & go at least twice a year!

I love Sacks and will go out of my way for lunch here!   Every time I eat at Sacks, I order something different. Sometimes it's a regular from the main menu, and sometimes it's one of their creative daily specials. I've never been disappointed. Fresh ingredients and fantastic flavor, created and served quickly by their super friendly staff in a casual cool ambiance.

These guys are amazing and it's easy to see why they have such great reviews- they have earned them! Good reviews got me here, the friendly, fast service keeps me coming back! Popped my lens back into my frame and I was in and out in less than 5 minutes. AWESOME- thanks guys!

Disappointed with my experience - the place was empty except for our group of 6.  The staff was unfriendly, there was no instruction for first time drivers, and they let the kids race with the adults.  I was hoping for some great competition racing, but the kart I ended up in was beat up and the slowest of the group - even full throttle I was being passed by kids.   For a better kart racing experience, I would much rather drive across town to F1 Race Factory - cleaner & better facility, better karts, 2 tracks instead of 1, better pricing, and kids race on their own track, separate from the adults.

I've been taking my cats to HV Animal Hospital since I moved to the Valley 10 years ago, and I wouldn't trust my pets' health to anyone else. Anyone who feels their pet is a member of their family will appreciate the warm, friendly, caring, compassionate and professional staff.  The office and exam rooms are impeccably clean, and a large waiting area provides one entrance for cats and a separate entrance for dogs. Wait times are never long, but having separation while waiting with a stressed out pet is very nice. Dr. Starkel in particular is very knowledgable and thorough with her exams, and always presents and explains possible treatment options. I appreciate that I never feel rushed or 'sold'. Slightly higher priced than other places, but you really do get what you pay for - definitely worth the extra peace of mind!

HV Animal Hospital is the only vet I trust with my pets and recommend without hesitation, and have been bringing my cats to for 10 years. Their facility is amazingly clean, modern, well kept, and every vet and tech is compassionate, kind, professional, and truly invested in the best interest and health of your pet.   They always provide treatment options, explain all charges in detail, and will provide a print out of recommendations to review in case you need to consider your course of action prior to committing to treatment. Post treatment you can expect a check-in call from the vet the next morning to see how your pet is doing and answer any questions you may have.   Same-day appointments may be available depending on when you call, and their extended hours (early open, late close, open both Saturday and Sunday) makes it easy for working pet parents to schedule a visit that works for your schedule.   Honestly, the level of care and compassion in addition to their level of professionalism and expertise makes it hard for me to imagine trusting anyone else with my pets. Like a good doctor or hairstylist is hard to find.... so is an awesome vet!  Thanks HV Animal Hospital for being amazing!

Hands down, BEST BURGER in Phoenix. Meet your girlfriends here for lunch when you're ready to go off your diet, and definitely order the donuts- but not to share. Heavenly.

Authentic Mexican & the best chimichanga in the West Valley!  Always fresh, and everything we've ever tried has been GREAT and very well priced. Dining area is reminiscent of Subway-style with some Mexican artwork flair, but if you're into great food with a casual atmosphere (or call ahead/take out), definitely a hidden gem worth checking out!
