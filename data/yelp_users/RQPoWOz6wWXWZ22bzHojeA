I normally don't review churches that I visit...but this one is awesome.  If I lived in Phoenix, this would be my place of worship.  The pastor delivered a real word-nothing too complicated...but relevant and applicable. Praise and worship was on point. The congregation and servants are MORE than welcoming.  I did not feel like a stranger here.  There is tons of love in this place, and they give it.  This church has a good, young adult vibe, but with a mix of members-young and old.   This is not my church, but I highly recommend worshiping with FCC!

I really enjoyed this experience. First, the prices for rides are great. We did the 1hr./$33 Ride. Second, The staff were understanding and accommodating. The manager, Dan, made sure we had all the info we needed to feel comfortable (we are beginners), and our guide made sure to customize the trail for our needs. What surprised me is that my friend and I were the only riders with our guide-we got lucky and had a private ride!!  If you're riding in the summer, I recommend 7am or night rides. It's too hot for anything in between.  FYI, we rode on Nebraska and Moe!

I've eaten here a couple of times and I really like this place. If you are not in the mood for chicken and waffles, don't worry. They have an extensive menu that is sure to please various taste buds, and you definitely get a good bang for your buck. I indulged in a nice country style meal (pic below) and was thoroughly satisfied. I didn't feel as if I had missed out on the chicken and waffles because my plate was so good. For dessert, if you like banana pudding, definitely give it a try. It tastes great and has a good ratio of bananas to cookies. On top of that, it's served in a mason jar!   Service here is great. However, if you dine in on a Sunday afternoon, expect to wait...like at all good restaurants.

I'm in town visiting a friend from Texas and we are on a happy hour hunt.  So we went to the Rum Bar specifically for that.  What's interesting is that there is no happy menu.  The chef chooses 2-3 plates to serve daily-it's kind of a surprise.   Food:  We ordered the Jerk Pork Sliders and Pork Belly w/ plantain.  We were highly satisfied with the pork sliders. They had a good flavor and just enough heat.  However, the Pork Belly w/ plantain was not to our liking. The dish is unique in terms of composition and presentation, but it's super small, (check out the photo) and the pork belly consisted of no meat, just pure pork belly fat. It was disappointing.    To drink, we ordered the Rum punch bowl special for the day.  It was amazing-full of ginger, lemon, honey, rum..etc.  I generally like drinks on the sweeter side, but this was a great balance.   Ambiance: It's casual upscale- a good setting for friends or casual business. There is nice Caribbean music playing in the background.  It's definitely my style.  Service: We sat at the bar.  There was a new bartender in training, which slowed things down a bit, but other than that, it was great.   If you don't want to eat, that's fine, but definitely go for a drink-try the punch bowl special of the day.

Honestly, if you like Mexican/Latin American food, eat here. The food is great!! I didn't care too much for the salsas because most were too spicy for me or just not to my liking...but I'll give them a pass-who needs salsa when the food is that good! The restaurant is small, and can be uncomfortable when full. But the place does have character, and our server was more than wonderful.

This is a nice casual upscale bar/lounge. The ambiance makes this lounge good for friendly outings or dating. They have a nice inside area and two separate outside seating areas (one including a DJ).  The drinks were good- I ordered their lemonade concoction.   The staff/servers were all very accommodating. The age range seemed to be 27-36 yrs. old. We went on a friday night and paid  a $5 cover. Give it a try.

This was my first time at a Studio Movie Grill.  The movie experience inside the theater was fine.  However, the restroom facilities were awful.  I visited 2 different ladies' room and they were both unkept.  They should consider getting complete automatic restrooms.

This venue has events going on during the week and weekends- I attended two. The manager, Audrey, is more than accommodating and she made drinks specifically to my liking (I'm complicated with alcohol).  I haven't been to the parties or club nights, but this is a good venue if you're looking to rent a space for an event.

This place has great happy hour specials with a cool/beautiful setting. They have happy hour all day on Mondays for the summer.  Prices are good and portions are more than enough.  We ordered both flat breads and the hummus trio.  Service was also great.

The yard is a great happy hour spot! They've got the right drinks and small plates at the right prices. The meatloaf sandwich is a must try! We sat at the bar, which was really busy, but service was great!   It's a fun-feeling restaurant. You can see people playing games, and there is lots of open space.
