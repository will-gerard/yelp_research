It was time again for  the annual health and fitness expo for the PF Changs marathon and half marathon. I never opt for convention center parking because it's $12!! Instead I usually just drive around and try to find a meter. This time we lucked out and found a $3 lot.  The convention center has a few eateries on the first floor. I've never partaken because I always stuff my mouth and pockets with free samples from the expo, but a lot of people were eating there and it smelled good!  The expo room is a good size, carpeted, big bathrooms, compared to other convention centers I've been to ours in Phoenix ranks as one of the nicer ones.

I like the design of this place. It has a huge outdoor patio area, plus balcony, plus indoor seating. We were seated pretty quickly and our server was fairly prompt with our drinks and order even though it was busy. I ordered the Vanna White veggie wrap which is described as grilled veggies and feta cheese in a wrap. Unfortunately there were no grilled veggies in it! It was filled about 85% with lettuce and raw, red onion. The rest was cold black beans, corn, and zucchini and a very light sprinkle of feta. The fries and coleslaw were good.  Ketchup and mustard bottles on the table were on their last leg and basically empty.  Bathrooms were very dirty with broken soap dispensers, broken door locks and sanitary bins hanging sideways by one last bolt.  I want to like this place more, but it felt like no one cared anymore about general upkeep and food quality. Too bad.

Quaint little house-style decor with beautiful patio seating...and what a wonderful time of the year to sit outside and enjoy the Arizona fall temperatures. We started  with the crab dip which our Baltimore native friends agreed was very good. They also ordered the crab cakes which were about as close as they'd had to the original back east. My husband got the pasta with green chile sauce. I think he was a little disappointed it was only pasta...and sauce. I thought it would have had more kick than it did with the green chiles. He also got the New England clam chowder which blasphemously had bacon in it. Not only do we not eat meat (so we had to send it back) I'm a native New Englander and authentic clam chowder does not contain bacon. Boooo. I think I enjoyed my dish the best-the barramundi served with asparagus, rice, and topped with a tomato and carrot salsa was the evening special. There was way too much rice in the dish but the fish was cooked nicely and the salsa had a wonderful flavor.  Our server was very good, and kept our water glasses filled. She forgot to bring out my friends side salad, so instead brought us a dessert to share.  It was a quiet night so they let us sit at the table long after we finished.  Their menu looks like they have some delicious sandwiches so it might be a nice spot to check out during lunch time.

We went here for lunch and got the buffet for around $10. The chickpea salad was ok, not the best I've had. I got a scoop of basmati rice and enjoyed all four veggie dishes (creamed spinach, spiced lentils, spiced cabbage and curried vegetables). The vegetable fritters would have been good if they were freshly put out, but they were cold and a little too hard/crunchy.  The multiple sauces were delicious and sort of fun to get a bunch of samples and try with your meal or dip with the naan bread. Oh, and the naan by the way was fantastic. They brought an order to the table and it must have just come out of the oven as it was super hot and toasty. Mmmmmmm There were two desserts on the buffet, a sweet "pudding" with almonds and cashews and a fried dough with honey.  Both were tasty, but again, I think the fried dough sat out a while so it was more chewy vs. crispy and the pile was all sticking together.  The service was prompt with removing our plates and refilling water glasses. All in all, very tasty food! I would've given 5 stars if it wasn't for a few of those buffet items being a bit stale.

A friend brought me here to try bikram for the first time. The studio is a good size....but then again what do I know in terms of yoga studios? The dressing room is cute, a couple bathrooms. The yoga room was a little stinky but what do you expect for hot yoga? Everyone's sweating their ass off in there, it's going to be a little stinky.  I attended two classes, both instructors were great, and seemed enthusiastic about teaching. They made newbies feel welcomed but not singled-out which is very important.  It was cool! Got me interested, enjoyed trying something new!

Girls' night out. We stopped in here after dinner for some cocktails. I liked the decor immediately. Dim, cozy, cool looking bar. I didn't really care for where we were seated, but it's a cool place nonetheless. They have an interesting cocktail menu divided by types of liquor. So if you're a fan of gin, vodka, rum, etc you can choose your drink accordingly. I sampled the Sophia Loren and Pisco Sour, which were $12 a pop. The SL was great, the PS I've had better elsewhere.  Here's what rubbed me the wrong way about service: two of my friends are pregnant and we chose MercBar because it seemed like the type of place that could make a couple sexy virgin cocktails. However, when we inquired if they could fix up some "mocktails" for our friends, the waitress simply said "oh well do you want some juice?...or do you just want water."  She didn't even ask the bartender or put an ounce of effort into pleasing my two friends at our table of four. That being said this place lacked major stars for customer service, and in my book that counts for a lot.

I decided to give this place another try, and I'm really glad I did. My friend and I stopped here on a Friday night around 8:30 before it got too busy. Apparently they take reservations for some of their couch seating, but table or bar seating is open to anyone.  The hostess was also our server and she was busy all night! She still managed to check on us as she walked by and always noticed if we needed another cocktail. The drinks were delicious, but still a bit pricey. I guess that's the Biltmore for you! The music got much louder as the night progressed but I was still able to carry on a conversation with my friend.  A much better experience this time! Of note, they validate your parking if you park in the underground garage, so make sure to ask and save yourself about $9. Hey-wouldn't you rather have another drink?

This store has the most beautiful kitchen items and is jam-packed with artisan goodies to make our home cooking easier. You immediately start thinking of how you can justify buying something. I'll make spring form-tarts every weekend! I can use these red placemats for at least 3 holidays! I need a better mixer to handle all the produce from our garden!  Also, I had no idea that they offer free cooking demonstrations and will teach you how to hold a knife properly or how to chop an onion? On this trip they were demonstrating pizza making 101 using their artisan dough mix, along with fresh toppings, in their pizza maker! They also have a fantastic mini pie maker that utilized some of their pie dough and filling and made mini pies in 7 minutes!! Sure they are highlighting their products, but they also tell you variations of use with your own homemade ingredients as well.  The staff was wonderful! Upbeat and friendly, it makes shopping here even more fun!

Restaurant week strikes again!!!  Ok, first impressions....valet puts all the expensive cars up front for looks. We get it guys.  Decor, it looks like a classic French restaurant that's been there a while. So that's fitting. We were seated in a little two-top against the wall though, with no view, no window. Kind of boring. Food was delicious though, can't lie. Between the two of us we ordered the tomato-leek tart, the brie and fig pastry, the lobster, the white bean ravioli, the flourless chocolate cake, and the hazelnut ganache. Both got a glass of chardonnay and devoured the bread basket.  Everything was very tasty and cooked beautifully, no complaints.  It was also very rich, decadent, and buttery.  Post meal make an appointment with your cardiologist. Service was fine throughout the meal once things got started, but we sat for a good while without anyone taking our drink order or introducing themselves as our server to acknowledge our existence.  They passed the water glass test with flying colors, but servers had no personality, so warmth. Is it part of the French attitude? Discuss.....

Somehow I always end up moving or helping a friend move in the dead heat of a Phoenix summer. This is the only time I want a soda, and the only time I really go to Sonic. Summertime + moving = Rt 44 Diet Cherry Limeaide.

I've tried to eat here before an it was temporarily closed. Come to find out they were transitioning from vegetarian to vegan. Their menu has quite a few choices, and everything looked good!  I ordered the bean curd and my friend got the curry soup and we split one of the summer roll selections. Delicious! Not to mention that they put fresh orange slices into their water so it was a nice, refreshing surprise.  All the menu options are very affordable and our waitress was able to answer some questions and help us decide. We arrived when it was very slow but it was picking up quite a bit by the time we were done, and we never felt rushed to leave. I'll be back to try the stuffed tomato!

We decided to try this place for restaurant week as they allow you to choose ANY app, entree, and dessert from their menu PLUS a glass of wine for $30. Not a bad deal!  We've been to the property before at the Pointe Hilton Tapatio and been to Different Point of View, their other restaurant. This place didn't have the same view but was still very nice inside. It's also built on the side of this mountain so the layout is more vertical with a high bar in the center and table seating below. The decor looks more classic, not hip or trendy, with dark wood, somewhere I expect to see my parents eating. We found the staff very friendly. From the hostess to our server to the food runners, everyone was great. On our servers recommendation we started with the Thai chili calamari and Farmers salad. Both were very good, although the Farmers salad was way too filling for an appetizer. This is more of a lunchtime meal for me as it was topped with avocado and cubes of fontina cheese. I begun to realize nothing would be "light" here. For our entrees we ordered the shrimp pasta and the scallops risotto. Both were especially tasty yet loaded with melted butter. The decadence was filling to say the least and I got full quick......but somehow not full enough to pass on dessert. Now how can I be full on regular food but still have room for a whole dessert? Mystery. We ordered the deep dish apple pie with cinnamon ice cream and the chocolate volcano cake. That's right, sweet cinnamon ice cream............melty chocolate cake............excuse me while I daydream...........

One does not go to Carolina's for ambience, decor, or service necessarily. One goes for amazingly delicious and authentic Mexican food-that's it. It's a dive establishment with hard chairs and bare walls that makes you feel like you're eating in some warehouse basement. The menu is pretty basic and it's a little confusing to figure out what items are vegetarian. Heads up, there aren't many. Even the guy taking our order was kind of confused. I could see it in his eyes (you don't eat meat?).  We ordered the cheese enchiladas with green chile sauce, the green chile and cheese tamales and a dozen tortillas to take home. Those tamales were kick ass-only way to describe them. Of course we opened the tortillas and started eating them with our enchiladas. Still warm and soft they are far better than tortilla factory which I used to think was pretty good. I used the rest of the tortillas we had purchased to make veggie burritos at home. I would come back for those tortillas alone!

We used a groupon to run a few races at this place. It's best if you call ahead of time to get an idea if there's a wait. It can get crowded and you may end up waiting over an hour to race.  They have you watch a short 5 min video on the rules and what the flags mean. You don a sexy head sock, pick a helmet and strap yourself in. The first lap is at a slower speed so you get a feel for the track. There are two of them. After the green flags fly you're off!!! I think you run about 14 laps in one race and by the end you are unleashing your inner Mario Andretti. If you choose to race more than one time, you can have them schedule you back to back or with a break in between.  If you choose to break in between you can hang out and get something to eat or drink at the snack bar. You are allowed to drink beer but they mark your wrist band to monitor how much you consume. Obviously they won't let you race if you're intoxicated. Normally they give you a print out of your race time but the printer was broken today so we viewed the results on the tv monitor.  If you've never tried it before, it's worth checking out.

I had some time to kill and stopped in here on an impulse to try a gel manicure. I've done gel manicures myself at home and love how they last at least two weeks. Since I was treating myself and having them done, I figured I'd go for the french manicure since I'm not that coordinated to do that for myself.   I was the only customer in there, until a woman stopped in to have a nail repaired. Having nothing else to do, the rest of the staff sat around and talked and listened to their ipods and played with their phones. The place wasn't very clean and a fine layer of nail dust seemed to coat everything at my nail techs station.   She shaped my nails kind of square-ish, which is not really my preference, but they look pretty good. You have to "cure" the polish under the UV light for each layer in order to set it. This just takes a minute or two but my nail tech proceeded to use her phone during this time. I find this annoying.  I paid $35 plus tip for the french gel manicure, and they charge $30 for a regular gel manicure.   My disappointment as I look at my nails one day later, is that there is a chip already. Gel nails aren't supposed to chip and they are supposed to last at least two weeks and just sort of grow out as your nails grow. So what's the deal? I guess I'm better off doing them by myself at home.

I've tried a sampling of their pizza at a food festival before and I thought I remember it being pretty decent. We planned to hang out with an out-of-town friend at his hotel in Chandler and get takeout. The Streets of New York said delivery would take 45 min. We ordered a margarita pizza which is usually a safe bet at any pizza place. It took an hour and the pizza guy went to the wrong Radisson hotel. So after about an hour and 15 min we got our pie.  We were all a little disappointed to be honest. No sauce, sparse cheese, and because of the sparse cheese the minute you pick up a square the chopped tomatoes fall off because there is nothing holding them on.  Too bad. I'm a big pizza fan and this was just sad .

Went here for lunch during the week. The place had a wait for tables, so we sat at the sushi bar. Always a good sign when a place is crowded.  They had some amazing lunch specials! Great deals on sashimi! We got the sashimi delux for $12.95: four different kinds of fish and four pieces of each one. They also had a list of specials for maki rolls ranging in price from $3-6.  Since most people sitting at the sushi bar were ordering from the lunch specials, the chefs were pumping those plates out quick! Lunch also came with salad and soup.  Delicious sushi, great lunch deals!

These type of stores are hit or miss. TJ Maxx, Marshalls, etc, sometimes they have EXACTLY what you're looking for, sometimes you just hit the perfect day and find something interesting, or sometimes you leave there wondering why you ever go back.  That's the nature of this place! You have to be in the mood to look around, because you never know when you'll find that perfect item. I've left here many times without finding anything. It just depends...  On this trip I found a Kenneth Cole Reaction bag for $27. I have a great pair of shoes I always get compliments on and I found them here last year for $15.   They also have some housewares that I've seen at other stores for three times the price!

Love it! Who doesn't love a buffet where you can eat until you wished you had worn your elastic waistband pants? At least here you can fill your belly with good stuff. Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not in denial. There are high calorie salad dressings and mayo-laden pre-mixed salads and fried croutons, but if you know anything about nutrition you can gorge on a huge variety of veggies and leave full and satisfied.   Not to mention that they have homemade soups (I LOVE the fact that their stuff is homemade) and muffins that are to-die-for. Those are my biggest indulgence.   I have been many, many times and have yet to be dissapointed. We recently tried their breakfast buffet on Sunday mornings and aside from their usual salad bar they have wonderful options like belgium waffels, french toast, a breakfast buritto bar, and the most addictive cinnamon rolls. Go after a morning run so you won't feel guilty eating those!

Shane Co. is amazing! My fiance had purchased a diamond which they placed in a temporary setting so he could surprise me with a ring. Since he wanted to make sure I loved the style,  I then got to go to the store and choose which setting I liked. This is the best of both worlds! To be able to be surprised, but get to choose a style that you love! Awesome.   Not only is the selection at Shane beautiful, they have everything from traditional to contemporary ring styles, but the customer service is 5 stars. The woman that helped us was very patient, not pushy at all, did not try to steer me in a direction that I wasn't interested in, and I left with a gorgeous ring.   I returned yesterday for a ring cleaning as our wedding is this weekend. I wasn't aware that a full cleaning with buffing/polishing took a few days and I hadn't allowed myself enough time. That's my fault, so I was all set to leave. The associate however was so accommodating and said "let me see what I can do, so it will be beautiful for your wedding.". He returned and said it could be done in 2hrs. I was so appreciative. They went a step above to provide such great service and my ring looks as clean, sparkly and polished as day 1.  Rarely does a business live up to the expectations set forth by the company, but Shane Co. seems to exceed them every time.

As literary works are moving faster and faster to battery operated devices, I'm crossing my fingers that real books never disappear.   This store was neatly organized, labeled, appeared to be well stocked and convenient location. Even has a starbucks in the back. I just love walking in and seeing people hanging out and reading.......

It's chicken time! My husband and I had been planning on getting chickens this January so we drove out to the west valley to The Stock Shop. On the phone they told us they had some baby chicks in stock, if they didn't have what we wanted they could order.  The staff was very friendly and helpful in answering questions and making recommendations for food and cage bedding. We picked out four little chicks, a bag of food and a 40lb bag of pine bedding all for around $32. Not bad!  We were told that the the likelihood of the chicks being female was 90%, as we wanted them for egg laying, and if they turn out to be male the shop will buy them back from you for $4 each. I guess we won't find out for a while but that's nice to know that they sort of guarantee their chicks.  Nice, clean store, plenty of parking, good customer service, fair prices.

I've been a AAA customer for 14 years in multiple states. I've never used their travel services but thought it might be worth it to try to book our destination wedding trip and airfare.  Our agent was helpful in booking our room and plane tickets, but when our out-of-state guests tried to call they only got her voicemail....and no return calls. Multiple friends and family members would call my husband and I stressed out that our travel agent from AAA is not calling them back. When we questioned our agent, she claims she never received any voicemails or that her "system was down". When our resort no longer had vacancies, she was unhelpful in assisting one of my guests in finding another resort nearby. She basically told her she didn't know what else was around. Isn't this the job of a travel agent?  I will tell you that all 15 of our guests booked their airfare and resort stay ON THEIR OWN. Our travel agent did not assist a single one in booking.  She became tardy with emails and follow ups and difficult to get in contact with.  She had suggested we register with AAA's Gift of Travel wedding registry without telling us that AAA will charge us a percentage of our wedding gifts as a fee. When I confronted her with this after the fact she wouldn't return my emails.  When it finally came down to retrieving this money that was our wedding gifts from our guests, she kept telling me the check already cut and sent out. This was June 1st. I just received the check on July 19th, after having to follow up multiple times with the branch manager.  It's one thing for my husband and I to have to deal with this hassle, but no bride and groom wants to make things difficult for their guests. We were very disappointed.

I was very curious about eyelash extensions so I purchased a groupon for a "flirt set" at The Brow Lady. The shop is small and it looks like they do a range of services like nails and waxing as well. I agree with Shar B. about the front desk staff. I wasn't greeted in a friendly manner upon entering either, just hustled into the back room.  First of all, I really wish their website gave some details and information on the do's and dont's of having these lashes if you've never gotten them before.   If you live in a humid climate (or plan on traveling to a humid climate), or do anything like swimming or hot yoga, then skip them. Here I was lying on the table telling my eyelash lady that I was about to leave for a trip to southeast Asia (I was hoping to do the eyelashes and forgo packing makeup) and she tells me "well I'll be surprised if they last a week". Huh? So I said "what do I do if I go swimming?" and she says "dry them immediately with a hairdryer". Of note, there are no electrical outlets in the remote jungle of Laos, and no, I wasn't  planning on bringing a hairdryer.   As she was applying I was already feeling cheated in paying for this once I heard they wouldn't last, but then she commented that she finished in record time....30 min. I thought ok, how long does it normally take? Their brochure and website says 1 1/2 hrs. So now, I was feeling cheated again, like I didn't get the full treatment because I came in with a groupon.   Well she was right about them falling off. As I sweated my way through yoga and then enjoyed swimming, etc on my trip they became scarce. I eventually had to pull the remaining few off which wasn't fun.  They might be worth it for a really important occasion like your wedding or something, but don't plan on them lasting through your honeymoon.

I'll start off by saying I'm not giving her one star based on her work....it was her lack of work. I have no idea if she does good work because she didn't do ANYTHING.  When I dropped off a dress for alterations I initially thought she was great. We shared some chit-chat and I asked if I could have my dress in a week. She said it would be fine. I had planned on picking it up on a Saturday afternoon to wear to a special dinner Sat night.  When I arrived to pick it up, there it was hanging on the hanger right where she put it when I dropped it off, with the ticket that said "Saturday" right on it.  She asked if I could come back in two days. I told her I needed it for THAT EVENING and she had told me that would be ok. Now, I accept the fact that we all make mistakes. However, as a new customer she could have somehow offered to make it up to me or given me a discount or something. Instead, nothing. So what's the motivation for me to give her the business? None.  Good customer service goes a long way. If you make a mistake own up to it and try to make it right. That's how you get and keep customers.

As we were sitting at Dos Gringos last night I turned to my friend and said "this is what's so great about living here." Really, everything about this bar says 'Arizona summer'. Fun, casual decor, huge outdoor patio, misters on high gear, people hanging out with their bathing suit under their clothes from just coming from the pool-or in our case going to a pool.... Some people will tout this as a college bar, well it is kind of. However Dos makes no promises to be something it's not. As soon as you walk up to it you know what you're in for. So if it's not your cup of tea, mosey on. As for me this seems like a fun place to spend a lazy afternoon.

Used to go a lot more often but haven't been in a while. Took my parents when they were visiting this past week as they have a pretty eclectic menu and I knew we could all get something we liked. I ordered the ahi tuna burger which was awesome!!! I also enjoy the raspberry crush martini and their selection of "skinny" cocktails. Most of which are made with splenda or agave nectar rather than sugary or sour mixes.   My parents got the pad thai and a burger, and my man got the southwest eggrolls. We finished off the meal with a honkin piece of red velvet cake which I think I ate 3/4 of. Totally worth it.

The whole idea behind Baja Fresh is that their food is made without microwaves, nothing frozen, it's supposed to be fresh food. Can you still put too much oil into something fresh? Of course. That being said, I do think they deliver on this promise. However, it doesn't mean that you can order anything you want and it will be "healthy" or "low-cal". You still have to be a consciencious consumer. So be smart and skip the chips, cheese, sour cream and you can have your lo-cal stuff.   I'm going off on a tangent here so let me reel it back in.......our experience here this week was a little slow. We waited for our food for a little longer than necessary. Turns out there was only one cook. However, when the food did arrive the manager made it up to us with drinks (we were just drinking water) and an extra item that we had ordeded. It was a nice touch and the food itself was great.   I had the grilled mahi mahi tacos and my man had the shrimp diablo burrito. We love the salsa bar and of course had to get samples of every one. We'll be back.

We've been here many, many times. Mostly for the same reasons everyone goes here: the gorgeous patio, the margaritas, and the warm homemade tortillas. That being said, when we were here last night and my husband "checked in" he was surprised to see only two stars. So we discussed and realized that what really kills this place every time is the service. Which is unfortunate, because they usually have a good product.   Until last night the food has been pretty good, not spectacular but again we go for the 3 reasons mentioned above. Last night though, I think I'd had it. We had our trifecta but it simply wasn't enough. The service was awful and my meal was served cold and tasted like it had been sitting around for 30 min. Which is probably the case because it took a rather long time to come out. I ordered the tesoro del mar which is basically a salad with jumbo shrimp. I've gotten it many times and the flavors are usually good. Last night the shrimp was stone cold and hard--I had trouble cutting it with my knife.   Our server was MIA most of the evening, and when she did show up it was to try to get us to order more drinks after we told her we had our fill at the bar waiting for our table. We had to request the tortillas because she didn't automatically bring them out, she was delayed with our check and with taking our bill after I was clearly fed up and wanted to leave.   I think I'm done. After I work all day, going out to eat is a treat. Going here again is not worth my hard-earned money or my aggravation.

Another pub crawl visit! Giligin's is always accommodating to us rowdy bicycle riders. It's just an all around good place to have some drinks and run into someone you know.....which seems to happen quite often! Super casual, laid back atmosphere. Leave your heels at home.

We all go to Walmart for the same reason--it's cheap, and it's cheap. You know you can pretty much get stuff here for less than anywhere, and that goes for most if not all of the departments. For this reason, we go no matter what it looks like, even if it's run down or has only one register open.  This Walmart makes your experience a little nicer since they remodeled it. They have more to choose from in terms of home decor and a nicer, easier-to-find-stuff layout.  Since it is Walmart, they still could use a few more registers open, (but it seems an improvement) and they returns dept always has a wait line. I feel myself aging every time I have to stand in it.  I would have continued to come there though, because, it's Walmart, and the closest one to me.  So I do appreciate the effort of the remodel.

I've stopped into this Walgreens for random things before, it's not on my usual list for toiletries and such but I didn't feel like driving to Walmart.  I was strolling around their beauty section and a couple of the sales associates actually asked me if I was finding everything ok. One of the associates who was working the counter in that dept came over and offered me a sample of the product I was looking at. A sample? At Walgreens? I had no idea. She even mentioned that she tried the product herself and told me that it's a good seller. Wow! I've never had such personal service before at a Walgreens. It was a nice surprise.  I think they are pushing a new slogan because both she and the associate on my way out the door told me to "Be Well". Thanks :)

Usually I go to Walmart for shampoo, soap, moisturizer, etc because it's cheap. The last few times though I've been so frustrated because their beauty section is always messy and never has anything in stock! In revolt I declared I shall go to Walgreens! I realized how nicely displayed their beauty section is and they are starting to carry a few new product lines. I was able to find my hair, skin, and nail products all in stock and all at decent prices.  The store associates here were so friendly too, I was greeted three times which kind of catches you off guard because it's unexpected.  They have a new rewards card that they've implemented. Although I think those are a necessary pain, at least this one allows you to keep track through your phone number which you input into the credit card machine. You don't have to carry yet another card! At the end of my transaction I got a coupon for $2 off one of the products I purchased to be used next time. Hey, at least it's a coupon for something I'll actually use!

Stopped in here today for some face lotion and eye cream, a girl needs to moisturize. As I was waiting in line the lady from the beauty counter waves me over that she can check me out at her register. She looked at my products, pulled out a shoebox and then proceeded to take out two $1 manufacture coupons for the products I was buying. HUH? It was liked they had clipped coupons for me!!! I couldn't believe it. What amazing service, I just had to update my review to share this experience. I am loving this store.

This place is amazing. I get 80% of my groceries here. They have the best quality and prices for produce in the area. It's also a lot cheaper to buy nuts and raisins etc in the bulk section! Ever need just a 1/4 cup of dried apricots for a recipe? Well no use in buying a whole package when you can just get what you need! They have a pretty good wine selection too and you can get some fairly inexpensive labels to try.   Their staff is always friendly and can help you find whatever you need. And for those of us who bring our own bags they give you .10 cents off for each bag. Most other stores I know maybe do .5cents or nothing at all. Go on Wednesdays when their sale flyers overlap and you get to take advantage of two weeks worth of sale items!

Sephora is about as good as it gets. When I was young and my sister and I discovered this store for the first time it was one of those moments that you stare in the door with your mouth open and just appreciate all the wonderful things you are about to find in there!  I do a lot of my Sephora shopping online for products I know I like and just need refills on. When I need to go to the store itself I know it's always going to be busy--especially this location being in Scottsdale Fashion Sq. At least they have the entrance to the outside and if you can just come and go from there once you brave parking. They are always adding new products, but things go quickly-which is why I buy online a lot. Many times I've found my favorites sold-out.  There always seems to be a good amount of sales staff and I can get suggestions and recommendations if I'm looking for something particular. I've also been able to get samples if I really wanted to try something. The staff is pretty knowledgeable about the brands and if one doesn't know they'll usually ask someone else to get the answer for you. They also have good customer service at the counter and with your receipt you can always return an item you are not happy with.

Stopped in quickly today to return an item I bought online. I had my packing slip so it was no problem and that way didn't have to deal with shipping the return back through the mail.  Also got my free beauty insiders birthday gift today! If you sign up for a beauty insiders card you accumulate points which you can redeem for little extras or deluxe samples. On your birthday they give you a little treat like a lip balm set or shower gel!

Bischoff's is THE go-to place if we ever need an Arizona-type gift for someone. It's also where I bring all of my out of town visitors if they want to buy gifts or get something to remember their trip. This place pretty much has everything you want: clothing, jewelry, food, household stuff, kids stuff, books, etc. There are always people shopping in there and if you don't find something here, you probably won't find it elsewhere!  Of course, tourist shops tend to be a little pricey, and this one is too, but they do have some affordable things.

I find myself going to the Sugar Bowl whenever I have out of town company visiting.This place is so cute; a historical old fashioned ice cream parlor in the heart of old town Scottsdale. It's pink and filled with old school diner booths and tables, or you can sit at the counter. The menu has classic burgers, sandwiches and soups. Years ago I used to enjoy their BLTs with avocado, but since I no longer eat meat I do find it a challenge to find something I want on the menu. For this reason I usually go for the ice cream, which is rich and creamy.   My husband felt ambitious ordering two scoops-rocky road and almond praline, and couldn't finish it. My sister powered through her two scoops of chocolate and chocolate chip. I ordered a small hot fudge sundae with chocolate mint chip, and the best part was the hot fudge at the bottom of the bowl. Yum. Our bill was just under $13. Our server was friendly and prompt with the order. This place is celebrating 50 years!!!

I have only been to one other Bikram yoga studio, so I don't have too much to compare to. Some of the comments of the other reviewers are true in terms of the size. Yes, it's small. It's tucked in the corner of the Fry's parking lot on Indian School and Miller. It also has a tiny locker room. I never use it because of this, I always come dressed for class and always go right home after class to change. Yes, the carpet smells a little musty......  Ok, that being said, it's the perfect location for me being super close to home. Also I've always found the instructors to be really good! Sure, there are always a few you like more than others, but for the most part I feel like they push you to do your best...no mater what that is for you. If you are having a "great" class they will point out ways to perfect your form and compliment a beautiful posture. If you are having a not-so-great class they will encourage you to stay in the room if you can and to try again if you fall out of a posture. Some instructors stick to the script while others will tell a few stories of their day or provide some meditative food for thought. And the director Andrea is always welcoming and supportive.   Yes, it's nice to have a spacious locker room and extra amenities but if what you really want is a great Bikram yoga class, this studio delivers!

Although we usually don't go out on a Monday night, we had a guest in town and the next day off from work so the opportunity had to be taken advantage of! I always forget about this place as it's tucked away location doesn't lend itself to a highly visible sign to jog my memory.  There was a jazz band playing and a $5pp cover charge. We opted for cocktails this evening rather than wine. Although they were very good, two of the selections we wanted were "out", which is a little odd.  We got the tomato-mozz flatbread, the manchego cheese and the fondue as well. Everything tasted very delicious as we cleaned out plates! Service was good and the decor in this place is so awesome. It makes you feel like you're in the basement of some speakeasy. Bar stool tables, couches, it's very cozy, dim, cool. Need to come here more often!

Wow, I haven't been bowling in a long time....probably because I stink at it! Anyone else grow up with candelpin bowling in the northeast? I am just terrible with a regular bowling ball...... Anyhooo we got a coupon for this place in the mail (in those valuepak things that usually only offer garage door openers, mailing labels, and window replacements).  Went with a group-6 altogether-so I was surprised that we were squished in with another couple. I guess the right side of the alley was reserved for leagues so they had to put all of us "regular" bowlers all on the left side. No biggie, it worked out ok. We ordered some pitchers of beer which our server was pretty prompt with. The group next to us ordered pizza which looked and smelled pretty good actually!  The scoreboard is all electronic, the alleyway and bathrooms were clean, and the lanes looked well maintained. Fun night!

We went for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. It was completely empty inside but what do you expect for late Sunday lunch time? The decor has some really cool Thai pieces, just too much of them. Too much bamboo and the like, but I find many Asian restaurants have this decor faux paux. Oh, and we commented to each other that the elevator jazz music was terrible! Some authentic Thai music or tranquil flutes would have been much more suited for the theme.  On the flip side, our server was very friendly and filled our water glasses constantly throughout the meal. I'm a big fan of this and establishments always get stars from me for keeping my water filled!! We ordered 3 different noodle dishes, my husband and I were able to substitute tofu on ours and my brother-in-law ordered chicken. Since we weren't sure how spicy we wanted our meals, our server brought out a spice paste and spice oil for us to add ourselves and explained the differences of each. I had a huge portion for about $10, so I ate plenty and still have some for lunch tomorrow!  There menu has a lot to choose from and everything sounds really delicious. Quite a few people had come in for take-out orders as well while we were there. I'm looking forward to my left-overs tomorrow!

Oh the Coach house! We've been here before but never during the holidays. Every year they win some kind of title for most gawdy light display, and if you drive past it you'll see why. It looks like the Griswald's house! However nothing had prepared me for the inside and all it's magical holiday spendor. Every inch of the place.....every wall, ceiling beam, corner, was decorated with holiday paper, tinsel, and lights. It was impressive. We went on a Friday night and it was packed with people!!! Their inside bar is a little small but the good thing is they have an outside patio area as well.  This bar is a fun Scottsdale staple to check out anytime, but definitely during the holiday season if you want a hefty dose of Christmas cheer.

Frank & Lupe's is a typical, no-frills Mexican food joint. Sometimes it's very, very crowded, and being a small place it can be kind of frustrating. Having said that,  I think it says something that people will repeatedly wait to eat here. I have never been disappointed. I usually get the fish tacos which are served with soft tortillas and you can substitute blue corn for no charge.  Their chips and salsa are slightly addictive. Rather than serving regular chips, Frank & Lupe serves fried tortilla chips which have an amazing crunch. Yes, their salsa is a little watery, but it's not short on spice or flavor. They offer you one basket on the house and then additional baskets are a couple bucks.  Service tends to be adequate. I find I get my food and drinks within a reasonable amount of time. Small-sized house margaritas are $5.50 and provide a nice kick.  I also like sitting on the patio--which oddly enough has windows--but you can feel like you're outside but enjoy the AC. No complaints on a 110 degree day!

Grimaldi's is one of my top pizza places in Scottsdale. Fresh ingredients, thin, crispy crust,  amazing flavor. It has a distinctness all it's own. When you are craving pizza you think "I want pizza" or "I want Grimaldi's pizza". It's just not like the others my friend.  Decor is typical pizza joint restaurant-red and white checkered tablecloths, simple furniture for their tables and chairs, some black and white photos on the wall. Every time I've been here it's been crowded and typically service is attentive and friendly.

We were seated fairly promptly for a Saturday night. My sister and I opted for a half carafe of the Sangiovese and large pizza. The half carafe is a pretty good deal and we had about two glasses each from that.  We initially had the wrong pizza delivered to our table-I think by a food runner-but as we had just noticed the error, our server came by and noticed it too. She quickly made amends to fix the error. Thankfully ours was still in the oven! As usual, good pizza, good wine, good service.

This is why I LOVE YELP! I was looking for a new tailor and I drive by this place all the time. When I looked it up on yelp I was so impressed by what I read I had to try them for myself.  Phil definitely lives up to his reputation. He knows his stuff and I appreciated his "brutal" honesty up front. Hey if your tailor can't be honest with you who can be? Rather than trying something easy, like a simple hem, I brought them a dress that needed some complicated alterations. Their reviews seemed like they could handle it.  Now, the dress fit's beautifully, much better.  I really appreciated the expertise and customer service from the tailors at Zizzo.  Thank you!!

When the oil change light begins to glow in my car, my heart sinks. I detest getting my oil changed.  You'd think it's easy to do....after all I'm not doing the work. What's insanely difficult is finding a shop that is reliable, reasonably priced, timely, and doesn't sales pitch you or pressure you for additional repairs when all you wanted was the oil changed.  I got a mass flyer in the mail and to my surprise this shop is so close to home. I made an appt over the phone for the same day. I'm not sure of their regular rate, but with the coupon I paid about $31 after tax. The guys were friendly and professional and I think I was out of there in about 35-40min.  The oil change service includes an inspection and they explained to me what my car could benefit from/need within the next visit or so. It made sense too, given the mileage of my vehicle. I appreciated the information and not being pressured into doing anything that day. I can't stand the typical sales pitch and "add ons" that shops try to sell you, and frequently if I get fed this pitch I don't return.  Ok, first time, good experience gets a repeat visit from me the next time...which is more than I can say for the last 3 shops I tried! Thanks!

It was that time again-the oil light came on in my car. Normally I would sigh in exasperation at the mear sight of it, but now I have the Car Repair Company as my go-to for oil changes. I had such a good experience last time, I didn't hesitate to call them again. I just so happen to get a coupon in the mail as well for their signature oil change service. I was done in about an hour and although they had a few recommendations for me, it was no pressure. It was more like: here's a few things your car could benefit from that you can think about for next time, no need to do anything now. Nice!  I was very curious about my brakes too. I haven't been having any trouble with them at all, but about 6mo ago when I took my car to the dealership, they recommended new brakes saying they were all worn out. Huh? I hadn't heard barely a squeak or felt any lack of stopping power. When I asked the guys at Car Repair Company, they said my brakes could benefit from a cleaning and/or adjustment the next time I came in, but that they did not need full replacement, and nothing needed to be done right now. Thanks for honest work and an honest recommendation.

Just had some brake service done and once again a great experience. Once you are on their mailing list you get coupons in the mail, so I was able to use one. It was easy to get an appt and after dropping off my car Jim called me with the estimate. I thought it was very reasonable. He also mentioned that my air filter could use replacing, as they had noticed it before on a previous oil change. When I asked how much he said it'd be less than $20 as they only charge you for the part, no labor to change that.  I had an air filter changed once at a jiffy lube and felt I was way overcharged. These guys at Car Repair Company are fair, they do good work, and it's really comforting to be building a trust with a repair shop like this one. It takes a lot of the anxiety and stress out of having car work done!

I've been a fan of Trader Joe's for years now. They have some cool and unusual products and you can always find something new to try.  I've been to Trader Joe's stores in several states and in every single one their employees always have a great demeanor and are very helpful. Goes to show they enjoy working for this company.  Their produce is good, but I find it a little pricey, so it's not something I usually buy there. Their wine selection always seems to be expanding and you can find some good, inexpensive wines as well. I think their frozen section deserves some credit. Usually I stay away from grocery store dreaded frozen dinners packed with who-knows-what kind of ingredients. Trader Joe's brand of frozen food offers many options with no artificial ingredients and no preservatives. They also have great frozen fish and a wonderful cheese selection.   My only gripe is that on occasion certain items are not available for whatever reason. This ends up being dissapointing when I have to make a special trip to get there and they're out of something that I LOVE that only they carry! They get me hooked and leave me wanting more...

I had no idea the history of the restaurant until we arrived. Our host pointed out that the building is actually made of adobe, as there was an "open" wall to showcase this. It was built by an artist and his work is displayed on the walls of the restaurant.  There is a traditional southwestern, cowboy motif throughout, but it's tastefully done.  I heard Lon's was great for their sunset views and chose this as a special place to bring my husband for his birthday.  Unfortunately, no one was seated outside on their patio and where we were seated inside, we couldn't see the sunset, which was disappointing.  I have only positives to say about the food and the service however. Attentive, friendly, polite, we never felt that we were looking around for our waitress. As a matter of fact when I reached around to grab our bottle of wine to refill our glasses she magically appeared to do that for us. Dinner was amazing; from the tasty breadbasket and herb butter through the sabayon dessert. We ordered the salmon and halibut which were cooked beautifully. The pommes and beer-battered maikaki (sp?) mushroom sides were devoured.  Get the mushroom if you go...it was our favorite item of the evening. I made the reservation on open table and mentioned that it was my husbands birthday. When we were seated our host gave a card to my husband which was signed by the staff. I thought it was a nice touch.

Service at the Persian Room was excellent. They have a very large menu specializing in various kabobs, but there are seafood and vegetarian options as well. There dolmeh and hummus is fantastic, and the traditional flatbread with basil, butter and onion was so delicious! A great place for large parties.

You can miss it, because its nestled within the outdated decor of papago plaza, but this place is a little diamond in the rough. They recently expanded although I don't like the new room. The beer selection changes seasonally, with some favorites that stick around and you can always sample something before you order a full glass. They also have a nice fridge selection if you want some for home or to take to a party.  Surprisingly my favorite thing here is the pizza. I'm a pizza lover, even when it's bad, it's pretty good kind of thing. For a brew house I was surprised that they're vegetarian pizzas are so good! It's one of my top two favorite places for pizza actually. Although it seems to take forever, and it does, it's worth it.    Service is kind of casual, like the atmosphere, but you never feel rushed. It's a laid back kind of place and I love that because many times we've gone there after a house project covered in paint or dirt and its all good.

I've mentioned how much I hate getting my oil changed.....I'll mention it again....I hate getting my oil changed. HOWEVER, this experience went pretty smooth.  Their signature oil service is just under $40 and it includes oil and filter change, checking fluid levels, tire pressure, and vacuuming the interior and washing the external windows. I've been to a Jiffy Lube before, and what I hate is being bombarded with extra stuff I need to fix. This time I was prepared. I know a little something about maintaining my car. Even if it is just a little.   The guy tried to sell me new windshield wipers....there's nothing wrong with my windshield wipers....how many times does it rain out here anyways??? No thanks.   He took out the air filter (classic move) to show me how dirty it was. I've learned this move from experience....yes, air filters get dirty, but I could still see the original green color of my air filter. Um, yah, it doesn't need replacing just yet. What else you got?  He says my coolant is low. How much is that? $3. Ok add it on. Even though it would be cheaper to buy my own coolant and fill it myself. I give in.   My car was pretty clean, so not much to vacuum, but the windows looked much better. Total cost was about $45.  ............Fast forward to the next morning. As I'm backing out of my garage this morning I notice a pool of oil on my garage floor!!! Why? Why? Why? I'm forever doomed for bad oil change experiences!!! So I call Jiffy Lube, ok good they're open on Sundays, and explain what happened. The guy apologizes and asks me to come back in. I say I'll be right over. They take a look at the car, top off the oil and clean up the leak. The guy explains some reason that doesn't make sense to me-something about the make of my cars oil pan and engine shape? I don't believe it. Why would something be wrong with my car all of a sudden? I think the makers at Honda know what they're doing, and since this has never happened before, it doesn't make sense to give me this excuse now.   I appreciate that they fixed whatever mistake it was, and apologized for the problem. Just admit the error next time, don't blame it on the way my car is made. That just sounds like complete B.S.

How is it that I live so close to this place and never knew it was here?! Tucked around back of Papago Plaza sits this English Pub, which was our first stop on a bike crawl last night. This place has happy hour specials daily, and lots of seating at the bar. We rolled in with a big group and they were pretty quick to get everyone served with drinks and even had pitchers of water out to help yourself. I think my budlight was $1.75 on draft and my husbands 8.25% craft beer was $5.  Next time I'll have to try the fish and chips!

Sally's is a great store. Tons of beauty supplies: haircare, skincare, nail care, you name it. Their prices are extremely reasonable and the also have sales and in-store coupons. The staff often seem pre-occupied but usually ask if I need anything-and in this place I prefer to just peruse around sometimes. Bottom line: great selection and great prices.

I came in looking for new wiper blades as we were expecting some monsoon rain. The associate looked up my car model and gave me an honest suggestion. Since he didn't have the cheapest blades in stock (which is what I wanted), he told me to try a local foreign auto parts store which will probably have them in stock and cheaper. I was really impressed that he shared this suggestion with me and actually was sending me elsewhere for the sale. Well, I tried the other store, and they were out all together. So back to AutoZone I went. I purchased the wiper blades there and they installed them at no charge without my even having to ask!  Great service!!

Normally the ticket price for an adult for the 90 min tour is $32, but upon arrival one of the volunteers offered the option of buying a membership which for the four tickets and the membership fee ended up being cheaper. So far so good.   Our tour guide had a horrible coughing cold, but she did her best to project her voice and lead our big tour group around through the domain of Frank Lloyd Wright. She knew her stuff too! She would offer to answer any questions and she never got stumped-was able to answer everything.   It moved quickly so 90 min felt like 15. It is a cool place. An interesting part of Phoenix history so it's worth a trip. I had my parents in town so it's nice to show off some local flavor to out of towners. If I had out of town guests I'd got again. The ticket price after you buy a membership is only $8 per person and that's valid for a year. Not a bad deal.

I will always like Four Peaks for what makes Arizona great.....drinking outside on a great patio. Just awesome. That's really why I come here.  I have fond memories of this place and many happy hours. It's also where I got to know my husband through intimate conversation over a few pints while we were dating!  I'm a huge fan of the peach ale. Simply delicious. The food is good, but a little greasy for my usual taste. Bar food though, so it goes well with beer. I ordered the margarita pizza and my husband got the beer bread wrap. His wrap was swimming in grease on the plate, which was kind of a turn-off. My pizza wasn't bad, but again, I come for the beer.  Friendly service, decent prices.

Although I don't care for chains, alas it served a purpose. I was looking for something on Mill where I could meet a friend for lunch, maybe sit on the patio, and have something relatively healthy  and affordable. I knew Z'Tejas has their under 550 cal menu so that's what I went for and got the ruby trout with steamed veggies and rice pilaf. The fish was somewhat overcooked but came with a decent pesto/salsa on top. My friend ordered the seafood enchiladas off the regular menu and really liked them.  Our server was doing his best, and did well, although he was pushing the sales pitch extra thick. He had a comeback for everything trying to upsell us on alcohol, appetizers, desserts, it was just too much. I wasn't in the mood and I found it annoying.

I love pita jungle! I hadn't been to this location before but it was just as good. It's an artsy decor with the open kitchen. Service is casual, yet still good. The food is always awesome and such huge portions! I always have to stop myself from finishing my meal because it tastes so good, before I have to be rolled out!  On this trip my friend and I got the felafel appetizer and the grilled veggie wrap which was on the special. The wrap was around $9 and since we had the appetizer I brought half my sandwich home.  If you've never been they make multiple varieties of hummus-all of which are good. I have never been disappointed with food here. Always fresh, delicious, healthy, huge portions and reasonable prices.

My husband brought me here so I could try climbing for the first time. I don't like heights but when the activity looks safe I won't let my fears prevent me from trying it.  I think the scariest part was realizing I had to "belay" him and be responsible for his safety. He's a good guy so I figured I'd keep him around.  They give you a harness, and horribly uncomfortable climbing shoes. Maybe I had the wrong size? The video wasn't really helpful I have to admit. You can't learn anything from it as a first timer, you really need that 1:1 instruction that is provided afterwards to teach you how to fasten the ropes and check them. That part of the instruction was great.  The climbs are labeled with degree of difficulty, so you can choose accordingly. One of the hardest parts is letting go of the wall as your partner lowers you down. It was nice to see all levels of experience in there.  A few other newbies like me on the same courses, and there were also a few show-offs...ok, I'm just jealous they were really impressive. Verdict? Yes, it was pretty cool. Check it out!

Out of this world. Great selection on the menu: sandwhiches, salads, noodle or rice bowls, etc. I've ordered the veggie burger, the pad thai, and a few of the other rice bowls and have never been disappointed. Oh, and the buffalo wing appetizer is to die for. Literally. Bring your defibrillator. The staff are casual and friendly and lack that "yes I work in a vegan restaurant so I'm more awesome than you" vibe. The decor is cool-urban-earthy.  Prices pretty reasonable, as well as turn around time for food. My pad thai was $7.50 for what is really two portions......I however scarfed it down as one.

Once again, love Green! Tried the diablo red rice bowl with mock beef. SO GOOD! I don't know why I think I can only eat half and take half home with me. Their food is so tasty I end up eating the whole thing!  Friendly counter staff, quick turn around time with the food, good sized portion, great selection. I have yet to try any of their desserts, but I was starring at a couple customers enjoy their soy sundaes and it reminded me to try one of these treats next time!!

I recently surprised my husband with a cruiser bike which I purchased from the Rural rd location (I'll vent my frustrations on that locations review). When I needed help with a customer service issue, this location came through with flying colors.   Not until I got the bike home did I notice some awful scratches in the black mat paint finish. The guys at this location offered to switch bikes for me, or what ended up working even better was to change the chain guard with another bike.  I ended up purchasing a rack for the back as well and they installed it at no additional charge.   I left there very satisfied with the customer service and they were great about helping me out. I think I'll take my needs to this location in the future.

House of Tricks was a first date spot for my husband and I, and has since become our anniversary dinner tradition.  We've always opted to eat outside on the patio, which is the highlight of this charming house-turned-restaurant.  Yesterday was our 2 year anniversary and we had a wonderful dinner. The kale salad was fresh and delicious. We both enjoyed the ahi and halibut entrees which were prepared beautifully. We also split a bottle of wine and the chocolate-peanut butter pot-de-creme.  I don't think we've ever had an issue with service here, although they were a little lax on the water last night.....I'm such a stickler for this.... It's such a wonderfully romantic location, and a local gem!

I have never been disappointed with the food here. Caffe Boa is part of the "slow food" movement so everything you order is supposed to be fresh and local, which I love. Today we were in the area early in the morning and hankering for a patio to sit and enjoy some drinks. They opened at 10am for brunch with bottomless mimosas, bellinis, and sparkling wine for $18. We had already eaten breakfast earlier but after several bellinis my belly needed some brioche french toast.  Our server was prompt on the drink refills, and kept our water glasses filled as well. This is always a big plus in my book.  Their patio has a nice, secluded feel, covered with bougainvillea vines and off the main Mill Ave strip. It was a nice relaxing way to spend the morning.

This restaurant has a much smaller menu for a Thai place. It makes it simple to look through, but I was hoping for a new favorite of mine, the Thai Soya fish, and they didn't have it on their menu. I opted for the grilled seafood which states on the menu that it comes on a bed of vegetables with Thai hot sauce. What it turned out to be was a combination of shrimp, scallops, calamari, and fish on top of....lettuce, with Thai hot sauce. So essentially a fish salad. The shrimp, scallop, and calamari were tasty, but the fish was awful. Dry, fishy-tasting. I couldn't eat it. Their fresh roll appetizer was pretty good but not the best I've ever had. I didn't think my meal was worth the $15 price tag, and just so you know ahead of time this establishment does not have a liquor license in case you are looking for cocktails or Thai beer to accompany your dinner.  Clean bathrooms. Decent service-our water was repeatedly filled, but for the food itself I would not return when there are so many other choices in the valley.

Have been here several times and just realized have not written a review! How blasphemous.  Was here on Friday for happy hour. $2 off appetizers meant a dozen oysters for $10. Not bad. Also indulged in some brews on tap. They have indoor and outdoor seating, the outdoor being the most fun, in my opinion.  I've also had some of their other food in the past. Mostly pub-style sandwiches and the like, very tasty.  Service can be slow, the place has sort of a laid back attitude. So be prepared to just sit back and relax.

Very slow Saturday afternoon, no line at the counter. I ordered the HealthMex burrito which was ready pretty quickly. While I waited I loaded up with salsa samples at the salsa bar. YUMMMM. I like that they have a lot of fish options as I don't eat meat. The burrito was very tasty and came with pretty good tortilla chips too. Delicious, quick meal!

I was way out west wasn't I? Ok, first time at this arena. We went for a concert and was pleasantly surprised to find it pretty organized in terms of parking. They have multiple lots with mult price tags: $20-$15 valet, $10 premium lots, and the free lot.....which was 20 feet from the premium lot. I don't get that.  Walking through the door I had an old man flashlight my purse and a quick walk through the metal detector where they then scanned our tickets. There were plenty of staff to help us find out seats. For this event I got floor tickets-which I've never had for any event, ever. Are the seats on the floor always this small? The big guy next to met tried his best not to invade my space but his shoulder was at about the height of my face so I was fully aware of his presence at all times. We purchased a soda, water, and popcorn which averaged around $14. Meh, what do you expect?  The bathrooms were clean and well stocked with paper supplies. Us ladies appreciate that.

I agree with Roland and Karl, hey it's Dairy Queen! What can you say about it? We were in the area and wanted a little sweet treat after dinner. I can't remember the last time I've been to a DQ. Maybe 6 years ago? I love that they have a mini blizzard size. I got the mint oreo and my husband got the pumpkin pie. Yum!

Yes, people. The food does live up to the hype. Fresh, local, homemade....what can I say, it was awesome.  I enjoyed every bite of it. I ordered the pizza verde with arugala and got the caprese salad beforehand with homemade mozzarella. Excuse me while I stop to dab the drool............  We were lucky to have gotten reservation seating when they still did reservations. (I guess they've done away with them). So I question whether or not I'd wait 3hrs. I think if I had guests in town who really wanted to try it I'd take them and just visit the wine bar next door like everyone else.  3hrs is a BIG chunk of your time if you're waiting for a pizza.   However, if you haven't tried it before. Do it people. We are lucky enough to live in Phoenix. Home of this pizza gem which wins best pizza in the US every year. If you live here  and you enjoy good food, you owe it to yourself to go at least once. You won't be dissapointed.

ok so I've been here a go-zillian times. This review is just a formality. This place is great. The food is consistently good. Extremely affordable with the portion sizes. In fact, I usually end up taking half of my meal home with me for lunch the next day! I have loved everything I've eaten here: the salads, the pizza, the veggie wedgie (which I repeatedly order when I should be trying something new), the artichoke lasagna, and the pizza cookie! There are few things worth blowing the calories for......this is one of them!   Can I also mention how the service is so friendly every single time you go?! These people are great, and they make you keep wanting to come back.  We eat here frequently and every out-of-town guest gets a trip to Oreganos. So far no one has been disappointed. Thanks guys!!

It's a great mall with a lot of variety, but save your sanity and either park underground (after 5 on weekdays or anytime on weekends) or around back. This place is always busy!! I've seen many stores come and go but they have all the basics plus some high end stuff if that's your thing.  Harkins theater is also inside and their food court actually has a couple healthy options.

First time here, came on a Sunday night for dinner. The inside is fairly small, but cozy. They have a large patio dining area with nice lights up, but it's too cold for that so no one was out there.  They have some interesting menu items that I've never seen before. My husband and I got the fig and panela cheese salad, the hibiscus enchiladas (yep, the flowers) and the huitlacoche crepas which is apparently a type of mushroom, or fungus, that grows on corn. Sounds like we eat weird stuff huh? Maybe so.  The salad had nice bite-size pieces of dried figs and cheese with a balsamic dressing. The hibiscus enchiladas had a sweet/tangy flavor to them with a nice side of sauteed vegetables. The crepas were soft and tangy with goat cheese and pomegranate sauce. I was impressed by all three!  They also bring out chips with two types of salsa.  Good service as well!

If you are staying at Ballys and want something to eat without having to go far, then this might work for you. It's located on the lower level by the shops and monorail. This place is small. Real small. Think of maybe the size of an average living room, and take away all windows, and make it all beige. There is nothing beautiful or appealing about this space, and nothing makes you want to sit here. I wanted to eat and leave.  That being said my  husband and I both ordered noodle soup dishes and they were both very flavorful. I have no idea where the kitchen is, but it's not inside this small space. Our food took a little longer than expected, and arrived on a cart covered in saran wrap as it had to travel from somewhere. Service was just ok.  Again, it's not bad food if you're feeling super lazy to leave the hotel, but otherwise opt for elsewhere.

The IP rocks. Why spend all your money in Vegas on your room? The IP is the perfect location where you don't have to walk a mile from the front door to the strip, nor to the next hotel. It also houses one of the best breakfast places EVER (the Hash House a Go Go). It's price rivals some of your basic budget hotels but it sits central on the strip, not in the middle of no where.   Yes, the elevators are a little slow, and our tub never seems to drain that well no matter what room we're staying, but regardless I'd rather save my money on lodging and enjoy my nights out.   Tip: stay in the towers. We thought we'd try a capri room this last trip and the desk clerk kind of talked us out of it saying that the capri rooms are more motel style and open to the outside off the strip. Sounds a little less secure to me, we were glad we switched back to the towers.

This is one of those Scottsdale establishments that's been around a while but I hadn't made it in to try it. Last night we broke off from our bike crawl pack to get something to eat. We rolled into Bungalows and found a great table on the patio-it was a perfect night to sit outside.  Our server brought us our drinks and waters and food came out pretty quickly. My husband ordered the halibut sandwich, our friend got the cajun ahi tuna, and I tried the veggie burger. I realize most places don't make their own veggie burgers, and I'm guessing they don't make theirs from scratch here either, but it was really tasty. Not only was it covered with the standard lettuce, tomato, and red onion, but it also seemed to have a sauteed spinach with cheese topped on there which was delicious. Both my husbands and my sandwiches came with fries and we were talking about how GOOD they were! Fries are something I'll only eat if they're worth it....these were. Thin and crispy, YUM!  Our server refilled our water a couple times, which always gets a star from me. Decor is as the name states: a bungalow. It seems beachy with an outdoor/indoor bar and "deck" seating. If only I could smell the ocean....

Wow, this was my 3rd Cirque show and by far the most impressive. The stage rotates completely! Performers are suspended by wires for most of the show because most of it is performed at a 45 degree angle! At one point the stage was up completely perpendicular to the floor!  This show was supposed to have a storyline to it, but both my sister and I found it difficult to follow. Any audio that was spoken was also difficult to hear clearly. Somehow though, it doesn't matter. The acrobatics and wire suspension are so impressive that you still sit enthralled.  Our favorite was the beach scene with the turtle and crab. Kind of random, but we loved it.

5 Stars for quality and variety all around. My friends and I had eaten at a different buffet the previous day and it was pale in comparison. We all eat mostly vegetarian/pescatarian and this buffet had so many options!!  We showed up for lunch and had to wait a little over an hour. At the time I considered leaving, but really glad we stayed.  There were vegetarian pastas, salads, burritos, lots of varieties of seafood including sushi, a fantastic cheese selection with breads, mustards and crackers........ The desserts were about 2 bites each which is perfect because you really don't want one big dessert at a buffet, you want a hundred little desserts to sample. Ok maybe not a hundred but between my husband and I we tried almost everything there.  Not only is the buffet great but this is such a beautiful hotel, and definitely worth seeing in Vegas.

I really like the decor of Chelsea's Kitchen. It's simple, spacious, and has a warmth to it. Parking is very limited but they do free valet. I actually like to park my car myself but you don't really have a choice here.  The menu had a few options I was eyeballing, although I decided on the kale and quinoa salad with grilled salmon. The kale was chopped nicely and the salmon cooked beautifully. I can't remember what my husband ordered....serves me right for not writing this sooner...but I do remember no leftovers. They have a nice wine menu with some selections by the glass. Our dinner companions split a burger and ordered an appetizer and dessert that they had gotten before and were joking about how they wanted to try something new but always like their favorites.  Service was very good and my beloved water was filled, oh happy day :)

It was a busy night on First Fridays and although it was full, our party of seven was accommodated with a standing table first and then moved to a table with seats when one opened up.  Drink orders came fairly quickly although mine was forgotten and I had to inquire where it was. They have a big sandwich menu with a few vegetarian options. I ordered the Tuscan. I liked that the bread was toasted nicely, but the raw spinach inside made it difficult to eat. Each time I took a bite, the spinach pulled everything else out of the sandwich. Probably would have been better if it was cooked first. I opted for chips as a side which were scant. My sister ordered the pita pizza-which didn't come with any sauce so she had asked for a little side of marinara. Unfortunately, a charge for $2.50 appeared on the bill for that little cup of sauce. I can buy a whole jar of Ragu for $1.59 so this was a little ridiculous and she wasn't told ahead of time about the charge. Service was friendly. I liked that she offered ahead to split checks by party. It would have been nice to get some water refills though, this is a restaurant must for me. Overall I wasn't impressed enough to return.

My girlfriends and I made reservations for a Sunday night at Nobhill. The decor was simple and elegant, nothing beautiful or spectacular. Not a huge place by any means so they use the large mirror on the wall trick to enhance the size and open up the place.   Their wine list and drink menu was pretty impressive. Our table represented all tastes: one ordered wine, one ordered beer, and I ordered the ?Marissa which was tesoro tequila, elderflower liquor and lime juice. It was delish and I had two.   For an appetizer we ordered the grilled cheese fondue-such a simple idea why hadn't I thought of this? Grilled cheese squares dunked into tomato soup! How could this NOT be good?  Entrees: As I am the veggie eater who eats seafood I ordered the scallops which were cooked perfectly. My friends were raving about their fillets.   Sides: truffle mac and cheese, which was great with large mushrooms and broccoli mixed in. French fries that had a strange addictive quality.   Dessert: the chocolate tart was creamy and tasty but we didn't care for the guiness ice cream on top.   The service was impeccable and two gentlemen stopped by our table afterwards to inquire about our experience (perhaps both mgr and asst mgr?).   It wasn't cheap kids. This place has four dollar signs for a reason. However, it's nice to know that if you're looking for a nice dinner out to celebrate you should get your money's worth and really enjoy your experience.

I had bypassed this place before based on inconsistent reviews, but things seemed to be looking more promising.  The decor has some cool pictures of India, but otherwise boring and sparse. The menu is enormous! It's a little intimidating, so ask questions. We ordered the Medhu Vada lentil doughnut appetizer. It's a very dense doughnut with a crispy exterior served with a couple different sauces. Very tasty-sort of filling.  My husband ordered an Uthappam which is like a pancake, with onions an spinach. I ordered the cauliflower mushroom chettinad which is like a curry. They accidently brought us a dosai (thin rice crepe) instead, but since they would have thrown the error out, they asked if we'd like it. So they packaged up my curry and we ate the pancake and crepe dishes.  They were delicious! And when we had the curry for lunch the next day, it too was amazing! Huge, whole mushrooms and large pieces of cauliflower with an amazing curry sauce.....mmmm.  Everything was so flavorful and the sauces were fun to sample all the different ones!  The value for dinner was pretty reasonable. Most dishes are about $10 and you can easily get two meals out of them.  Service was good. Like I mentioned they fixed the error and didn't charge us for the wrong order the brought out-but let us eat anyways. We had our water glasses filled throughout the meal as well which is important when eating all this spicy goodness! I'm glad we gave this place a try!

Despite it's annoyances at times, I love IKEA. I like their style of clean lines and organized, clutter-free living. Their prices are comparable, if not cheaper on most items. Yah, I have to put it together myself, but as long as all the items are present in the box then I won't have a meltdown.  We've purchased a lot of things from there and since they're not expensive if you want to change up your decor later on, you're not braking the bank. I've also found returns to be pretty hassle-free. Just save your receipt and what's left of the packaging to bring it back. It's ok if it's not perfectly packaged. Just try.  My gripes? It's hard to find an associate when you want one. Today two other customers helped me move my giant desk-in-a-box because my own powers of levitation weren't working and no one else was around.  2nd-Saturday shopping. Each time I'm there on a Saturday I think to myself "what the hell am I doing here on a Saturday". Trust me. Go during the week.

Now they have a small grocery section near checkout so you can wander through the food selection and have some vanilla frozen yogurt! Why does a furniture store always smell so good!!! They did away with most of the self checkout lines and now have more associates at the registers, which speeds up the process a little.  Returns still quick and easy.

Meh. What can I say. It wasn't terrible, but I wasn't impressed. I had a restaurant.com gift cert  to try it out. Normally I don't mind the 18%gratuity that gets added on....but c'mon people. We got our food at the counter.....like McDonalds. What the frig did I just pay an extra 18% for?   Ok, so that's not their policy, I understand that. Aside from that, there was a woman who walked around sort of cleaning. She never asked to refill our water and no one came around to ask if the food was any good. It just seemed a little expensive for something that was the equivalent of fast-food sushi.   I've seen the decor a hundred times. It's called IKEA. And I already have enough of it in my house as it is. I'm looking for something different! Keep me as a customer! Make me want to return!

This place is very entertaining-bartenders slinging drinks, a DJ spinning music in the back, whistle-blowing, etc. The outdoor venue is always loud and has plenty of people , so they must be doing something right. We ended our Sunday evening here, arrived about 12 midnight, wasn't too crowded. The drinks were pricey---club prices, not bar prices. Paid $31 for two vodka cranberries and 3 waters. We were finishing up my bachelorette weekend and were wearing sashes to indicate such. Some nice guys from Brazil offered up their seats at the bar for us. My gripe was how long it took to get a drink. I know it's a busy bar, but it was a Sunday night.  It was almost as if the bartenders were way to interested in how cool they thought they were (ok the tricks were very cool) and not taking drink orders. It wasn't until my friend leaned over the bar flashing the cleavage card did we get any response. Somehow I can wait for food, but when I sit down I want a drink in my hand asap. After our one round we never saw our bartender again. I've had more fun elsewhere.

This was our third trip to Wildfish. Each time we've had good experiences. The service is always professional and top notch. I always say that really does make your experience dining out special. Anytime I'm out and having bad service, I always think to myself...damn, I could be eating at home. So thank you Wildfish! Their menu is full of amazing options and I have always found the fish cooked perfectly. The servers usually tell you how each fish is cooked, if you want it prepared more/less done such as with ahi, but I always leave it up to the chefs to prepare each fish at it's optimal "doneness". I never buy swordfish at home because of the sustainability issue, but um, it's delicious, so I did order it here and enjoyed every bite! My husbands ahi tuna was also amazing and his plate was so beautifully presented.  Oh, and how could I forget about my mushroom and arugula salad? It was so tasty with warm goat cheese and sauteed mushrooms.......I could eat just a dinner version of that with a glass of wine and be happy!

This place has become one of my Vegas traditions. Nestled inside what used to be the Imperial Palace, now The Quad, the Hash House is open 24hrs for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I've only eaten breakfast here, but with the size of the portions this one serving could feed you all day.  Everything is farm fresh and homemade. Their pancakes are the size of a car tire, no joke! The brown sugar and banana is my favorite and it should come with a side of insulin because this thing is sweet tooth heaven! They also make amazing hashes that come with biscuits the size of softballs! Decor is industrial-farm warehouse. For breakfast come early or you will be waiting. Service here is always friendly and they have really good coffee. Overall amazing food and perfect for a Vegas hangover meal!

Another great Fox restaurant. I have yet to try one I didn't like! I liked the decor. It's much bigger inside than I was expecting, yet still manages to have a cozy feel with dim, pendant lighting. I had a great cocktail at the bar, the cactus blossom, and my husband had a delicious martini.  We ordered a few small plates to start our table, the mushroom bruschetta, mozzarella and tomato brushchetta and artichokes on arugula. Their bruschetta are small, only 3pcs but reasonably priced at $4 each. My husband and I ordered the mushroom tortelli and sweet potato cannelloni. Both were delicious and sort of rich tasting, so they were filling. One of our friends ordered the salmon which looked like it was perfectly cooked.  Our server was friendly, attentive, and spaced out our entrees at a good pace so we didn't get too full off our appetizers.  Now that the weather is warming up, they have a huge patio too!

My husband came home with buttery croissants, a chocolate almond croissant, and a huckelberry tart with creme fraiche. What is it about pastries that just make you happy? Minus the guilt later of course for eating that as opposed to some broccoli? Either way, all three items were amazing. If you're going to splurge do it with something worthwhile!!!

Not a bad happy hour deal here! M-F 3-6 drink specials and food specials including $5 fish tacos that were deeeeelicious!! Specialty cocktails are $2 off so those will run you about $7 at HH. I tried the violet femme which came in a chilled martini glass! I have NEVER had a chilled martini glass before.  Our water glasses were filled repeatedly (yes!!) and we enjoyed the splendid AZ weather on their patio.  Of note: I'm anti-valet parking unless it's super far + wearing heels. Otherwise I prefer to park my own car and carry my own keys, thank you. However the lot is so small at the Vig it's mandatory parking for $3. What irks me even further is that the vallet was MIA so we parked the car ourselves, had to give him the keys and then pay him to bring us the car when we left even though it was about 20ft away. Minus one star for such ridiculousness.

Enjoyed New Years' Eve here at the Stone Rose Lounge. The event was mostly outside around their outdoor bar. Although it was a very cold night, they did pretty well positioning all those heat lamps everywhere. The seating looked very pretty, but it was all at an additional cost so we chose to stand and mingle around the lamps like moths. There was an indoor bar as well. I was surprised that the ladies room only had two stalls. Granted this evening had a lot of guests but ladies rooms always need more than two stalls! So nonetheless there was always a wait.  The hotel lobby was decorated very nicely for the holidays. Valet was complimentary for the event. Drinks were expensive but I wasn't expecting a bargain there. There was a complimentary champagne toast at midnight and a DJ provided entertainment.

The name threw me off at first when my husband suggested it for lunch. I thought it was a chicken place or something with cornish in the name. Oh no my friends this place is fantastic for meat and veggie eaters alike.  A pasty is similar to a calzone, but with a flaky pie-type crust, not a dough crust, and filled with various meats or vegetables. Kind of like a pot pie to go. To our delight they have a whole menu page filled with vegetarian pastys. I got the eggplant parmesan and my husband got the tiki masala with "soy" chicken. It was just delicious!!! Flaky and warm with delicious filling for $9.  The inside is British pub decor with dark wood, church pews for seating, two bars where you can order drinks/food, and the staff was super friendly. We sat us at the bar and one of the employees enthusiastically pointed out the purse hooks for me to hang my purse! Every bar needs to have these!  I think this place is automatically a new favorite.

This bar is an old renovated house in the heart of the artsy "first fridays" area....and what a cool place it is. Their beer menu is very, very impressive, but they don't discriminate. They also have some wines by the bottle/glass as well. Seating is minimal, mostly standing room, although they do have a few tables and seats along the wall. Live bands frequently play here although there wasn't one on the night we were there. Service was prompt and they prefer to set up a tab as...well hey...like potato chips its hard to just have one.

Ahhh gelato.....what would the world be like without it? I don't want to know. It's amazing stuff, and this establishment has a great selection of flavors. They offer sample tastings and although I could easily try all of them, I figured two was socially acceptable.   The decor has a euro-retro feel and there always seems to be somewhere to sit which is nice. We've never ordered the Italian coffee although it smells delicious as well.  A great treat anytime!!!

I've been to the Hotel Valley Ho for a couple events, have used their spa once before during Arizona Spa Week and been to a their lounge bar and their restaurant. I am in love with the hotels' retro decor. Cool and classic with little spaces to lounge and enjoy a cocktail. The staff always seems attentive and helpful.  Last night we ended here for our SanTan Brewery bicycle booze cruise and enjoyed music and drinks by the pool. Although we were enjoying mostly SanTan beers I tried one of their patron margaritas which was large and green and potent. Thanks Valley Ho for  welcoming all us rowdy pub crawlers with open arms.

I was working in the area and craving a healthy salad for lunch. My usual love affair salad place was too far so my colleague and I decided to try Jason's Deli. He'd gone there for sandwiches many times and never tried the salad bar. For about $7.50 after tax you can get a pretty good selection of veggies, dressings, even a few pre-made pasta salad options. They also have crackers and mini muffins. The salad area seemed clean and well stocked. There were enough tables to sit, even during the lunch rush.

Finished a great hike today and didn't want to blow it on greasy food afterwards. Pita Jungle came to mind!! This place has such a great menu and even though I'm always tempted to get my favorites I tried something new today.  Everything is always fresh and I haven't been disappointed.  Today I tried the macro platter which was brown rice, tofu, steamed veggies, beans and pita for $10. I know it sounds kind of hippy-crunchy, maybe it is, but it was delicious. I love real food. Their hummus is also a favorite of mine and they make a few different flavors. Deeeelicious!!

My husband and I were looking to bring a friend here yesterday from out of town. I've always been happy with everything I've ordered from Pita Jungle so I knew our friend would enjoy it. We started off with the cilantro-jalapeno hummus which was amazing, and they brought us extra pitas as well since there were three of us. I went for the falafel pita, which had a wonderful crunch and was conveniently wrapped in tinfoil so as not to fall apart while eating. I would have loved a bit more tahini sauce as it was a little dry. My husband ordered the fatoosh salad which was enough for two huge servings and had wonderful crunchy pita chips alongside. Our friend ordered the chicken tiki masala and he finished his whole plate in no time.  Our server kept our waters filled, the vibe is always cool, no nonsense, healthy, good food. I also like how you can just go casual-sometimes it's nice to just stop your weekend yardwork or housekeeping and grab a good, healthy meal without having to get all dressed up. Most casual, convenient/fast food is not stuff I want to eat!

Since I've been running the past few years, I usually do pedicures at home. Running gives you ugly feet so it's kind of embarrassing, but something told me to get over it and go. I stopped in here very impromptu on my way home. It seemed to look like any other nail salon: bland, fake plants, stacks of old magazines, but the pedicure stations looked pretty clean so I sat down. For some reason I felt the need to apologized for my ugly nails telling her that running has ruined them. She said dancers have the same problem.  At least I'm not a total mutant. She did a nice job with the polish, although the rest of the pedicure was kind of lacking. For the massage part it was more like just putting lotion on than an actual massage. $24 for basic pedicure.

One would think that this place is only doctors offices. However, they also do multiple cosmetic procedures such as line fillers, facial peels, and laser procedures. I purchased a groupon for two 30 minute laser treatments for spider veins (the upkeep never ends does it ladies??).  This place is really easy to get to on 9th street and they have their own parking lot. The ladies at the desk were very friendly and as I filled out my paperwork they gave me some info/pricing about their establishment along with a few samples of sunscreen and eye cream (who doesn't love free samples???). My technician was Eve and she was easy going and friendly. She set me up, took some before photos, explained how the laser treatment worked and started zapping. At the end she made sure I had after-care instructions and asked me to make a follow up appointment so she could check on my progress.  When I came back two weeks later she gave me the green light for my next appointment and also brought in the nurse practitioner to check on me too. My only negative was the appointment room was sort of small and the lighting wasn't great. I found it a little too dim to work, and I suggested Eve get another lamp to decrease eye strain.....well that's just the OT in me though.

I have been consigning items here for about 4 years now. I've since brought in household items, small furniture pieces, and lots of clothes. Yes, there are rules to follow which can be a little cumbersome ie)everything needs to be on a hanger and ready to hang and sell, mon-friday consignment is between 11-7pm but you are limited to 25 items at a time (you can make an apointment for more on a weekend day if necessary), when you bring in consignment items you need to wait in the store-you can't run next door for coffee or a quick errand.   Yah, they can be a little picky, but I guess they are choosing items that they think will sell and make money. That makes sense-they are making money for you too, obviously.   I've been to other consignment stores such as Buffalo exchange and My Sisters Closet and didn't have as much luck. I find that this place usually takes at least half of what I bring in.

After about a year I stopped in here to drop off a few items and see if I had some money on my account. The store seems to have expanded on their household section and had some really cool glassware and unique furniture items. They still  have a large selection of clothing and accessories although I usually don't shop while I'm here. They took 5 out of the 9 pieces I took in for consigning, and I had $50 waiting for me on my account from stuff I had brought in last year! Hey, if I'm not wearing it, it's going to Goodwill so even getting  a few bucks is worth it!

I was surprised to walk in here and see tables and chairs, and a bar! I assumed it was only a storefront for her chocolates, but you can order champagne and desserts-even reserve the back half of the establishment for private functions! We got to sample tastes of the red velvet cake, passion fruit dessert, and the third was a chocolate ganache filled piece of heaven. We also got a chocolate lesson on what exactly 70% dark means, and the difference between milk, dark, and white chocolate.  Meeting Julia Baker herself really made this trip to Julia Baker Confections something extraordinary. She really has an interesting story about how she got into the chocolate business!

It was time again for our company Christmas party at the Millennium Resort! It's not super fancy, but I always like how the room opens up to the patio area and you have the view of Camelback Lake behind you. It makes for a very pretty party backdrop and they had heat lamps outside as well.  Staff there was great at keeping the place neat and getting rid of plates and empty glasses.

We sat on the patio, which was really nice with a covered awning to block the sun. "Mandatory" valet for literally a 20ft walk. Again, this is on my ridiculous list. Just let me park my own car unless I'm in heels, and it's a mile away, and snowing, ok?  The happy hour menu is pretty decent though. They offer many of the same menu items at a better price, so it' worth going at this time.  They don't have a huge selection of vegetarian options, but the veggie flatbread and forbidden rice bowl were both excellent. The goat cheese appetizer I could skip next time. The tomato sauce overpowered the goat cheese and the bread that came with it was so hard and difficult to eat. I had two of their mixed cocktails which were delicious and went down all too easily.  Service was pretty good. The food took a little while but I don't mind when it's fresh and tastes clean and delicious.

We were out here for the first time last night waiting on a concert to start at Jobing.com arena. I have never been to Westgate-what a cool place! Since I'm an east-side dweller, I usually visit Tempe Marketplace or occasionally venture north to Desert Ridge. This had a similar design with a huge water feature and was nicely decorated with lights for the holidays. There were a handful of restaurants-although nothing to stir my fancy too much, and various shops around. The open design is always nice in Arizona, and the way this one was built encourages a lot of people to sit and just enjoy the place. There is also a huge movie theater and plenty of parking.

With my sister visiting in town this week, of course I had to take her to Sprinkles. The line was out the door, but once we got inside, the staff was so friendly and upbeat, they really moved the line along.  Everything in here is made with natural ingredients and they do offer a few vegan and gluten free options. Forget that though, we went with the real deal!  So as we're looking at our options my ass says "hey, you're in here already, just go for it". So we ordered four cupcakes that way we could share and taste a few different ones. We got the coconut, red velvet, vanilla with vanilla frosting and vanilla with chocolate frosting. Yes, there was even some sprinkles action going on on top of the last two---or as we used to call em' back in Boston..."jimmies".  I agree with Lindsey, it's ALL about the frosting. This place doesn't disappoint. Creamy, sugary, thick. If I wasn't paying $3.50 per cupcake I'd just eat the top part because that's where all the love is.

I prefer the Miracle Mile Shops over Forum Shops or City Center because, um, you can actually shop. This working girl isn't used to dropping dough at Louis Vuitton or Gucci on a weekend trip so the Miracle Mile gives you the indoor shopping experience-complete with cloud covered ceiling, but with stores that us regular people can actually shop at. Granted, if you had a lucky night at the casino there are shops to splurge too. It's worth a walk-through.

I discovered this place online when I did a search for good Sunday happy hours. To my disappointmen t they don't really have a happy hour menu.  $3 house wine, a few other drink specials, no food specials. That was about it.  The food turned out to be good though. I ordered the spinach salad, sans bacon (for my veggie-eatin' self) and the rest of my group ordered pita or ciabatta  sandwiches. We got a baked cookie dessert but it didn't compare to oreganos or humble pie....pale in comparison.....even though there was none left.  Our server was a little bland at first but he warmed up. Kept our water glasses filled which is a big deal for me. Decor was stylish and contemporary. Everything was navy. It wasn't super busy so we didn't feel rushed to leave. At $3 a glass my house chardonnay was pretty decent.

About a year ago I stopped into this shop for the first time and bought my first Bettie Page dress. The vintage styles are so fun and are wonderfully flattering! I've been hooked ever since. I've since bought dresses online but each time I'm in Vegas I make sure to stop into this boutique in the Miracle Mile Shops.   The sales staff are helpful and if there aren't already shoes in the dressing room to try on with your dress, they will bring you a pair.   On this occasion the dress I wanted was not available in the size I needed. The girls offered to call the other store.....wait the other store??? There's another one? Apparently there is another bigger Bettie Page at Caesar's. They called over, the dress was available and they offered to put it on hold for me. Thanks ladies!!! Follow me to my next review........

Cute decor-who doesn't like IKEA? Attentive service. We ordered a couple beers and the sweet potato tots. I decided on the Ahi burger and the veggie burger, and my sister went with the two sandwiches: PBnJ and the grilled cheese. Everything was delicious!!!! Unfortunately for us we arrived about 30 min prior to happy hour, but we managed to get a couple beers at the $3 happy hour price.   I've been here once before and since then it looks like they added a few items to the menu. I'll have to go back to try the shrimp po-boy and the red snapper burger!

I came in to make a quick return and pick up some fancy-stone-looking spray paint. The return counter had no line! Score! This never happens! I was able to find the spray paint I was looking for, and an associate to ask a question....hmmm, this trip ran all too smoothly.... Well, I'll take it when I can get it! Store looked clean and organized too.

I always like checking out what this store has. Even though it was the Sunday after Black Friday, I have to say the store was pretty neat and organized. It's challenging at times when you are looking for something specific, as I was on this visit, but that's the nature of the game. It's a hunt, a bargain hunt my friends.

It's AZ State Fair time again! We always try to take advantage of deal days so our typical visit is on early Sundays....when it used to be free. This year was $2 before 2pm. ok not bad. This Sunday also had the $35 unlimited rides wristband. Good in theory, until everyone does it and the lines are crazy long. If riders didnt have a wristband, then they were jumping the line with a fast pass for an extra $25. I don't mean to complain because I love the fair, but I dont feel we got our $35 worth. The lines were so long we didn't get to all of the rides we wanted to.  However, since the real reason I go to the fair is the food, they won my heart over this year. All my favorites were there, but also newcomer loves such as the deep-fried nutella and fried lasagna. I got the tipoff from a New Times article prior to going, so do your research and establish your face-stuffing game plan!  Next year I may have to try one of their foodie Fridays! Oh a note on parking....shop around! The lots are all marked differently and the prices go up the later you go.

I love this store! A great variety of household items including carpeting, window treatments, accessories for every room, lighting, not to mention kitchen items and food items! Make sure you sign up for the World Market Explorer which emails you sales and coupons! There items are stylish, functional, and affordable. They also do in-store wine tastings for their extensive wine selection. Their staff is consistently friendly and helpful. I always see them smiling which must mean it's a great place to work as well. Their items change seasonally too so there's always new stuff to drool over! Also very easy to make returns or exchanges here as well, which customers appreciate.

I went in armed with coupons! I must have circled the store a dozen times trying to make up my mind, I love everything! The staff is so great, not pushy at all. One of their associates would see me struggling to hold a bunch of items and offer to put them up front for me, yet never try to "sell" me anything.  They have great little displays that help you match and visualize items at home and how they'd go together. They offer great discounts on their wines if you're a world market explorer member too. Their products are good quality, and they stock their standbys as well as new products pretty well. It's not often that I see something totally out of stock.  Always fun to go here, and never leave empty handed!

I really like Tempe marketplace. I think there's a pretty good selection of box anchor stores as well as smaller stores to walk around and shop. In terms of restaurants we haven't been super impressed by anything in particular. The ones I've been to, have only been that one time, haven't gone back for a second round.   I think a nice job went into planning the decor. I think the firepits and water features are cool and during the holidays we try to stop by to check out the decorations each year.    We probably visit here mostly for the movie theater and I have a weakness for World Market. A negative for me would be the parking lot plan. There's plenty of parking to be had by all, but the entrance off of Hayden is terrible, exiting there is even worse (having to make a left where Ulta is is just poor planning). Sometimes I don't want to deal and I end up at Pavilions for my Michael's fix.

We had a great experience here on cinco de mayo! Even though it was busy, our server was spot on! She checked on us frequently to make sure we had everything we needed. Excellent list of tacos...I got an ahi taco and grilled mahi mahi. Both delicious and a good size. They have a terrific margarita menu too-the good stuff, no bottled, sugary mix junk. Unfortunately we were too early for happy hour but they offer HH drink specials plus daily food specials like taco Tuesday!  Cool artwork inside as well!

One of the local jewels during the holidays in Phoenix. Luminarias is fantastic. It's romantic, beautiful, and imparts a wonderful holiday feeling.  Over the years, they've added to the event with many more musical performances. There are also mini bars around where you can purchase wine or hot chocolate. Some of the DBG staff/volunteers are also standing around to help direct you as well and make sure you don't miss any of the trails!  This year the Chihuly exhibit was going on at the same time which was truly amazing to see his work lit up at night and juxtaposed amongst the plants. It was the best Luminarias I've been to thus far!

I visit the garden every time I'm in Vegas. They do such an incredible job! The garden changes with the season and uses all fresh flowers and greenery. Their summer display with birds even used various types of natural seeds to decorate the birds!! Even though I know they use real flowers, I had to reach down and touch the hydrangeas because they were so perfect looking, they didn't look real! Don't miss this beautiful attraction!!

We had been to this Crust years ago. Since we had not had the best service experience, we hadn't returned. Last night though we were waiting on some friends to arrive for another restaurant in the area, so we decided to stop into Crust for a drink.  There were plenty of tables when we arrived, although the place filled up very quickly in the few minutes we were sitting there. Which is always a good sign! They offer $5 cocktails and glasses of wine during happy hour which turns out to be a FANTASTIC deal especially if you are interested in sampling a wine that's a little more pricey.   If we didn't have previous dinner arrangements I think we would have stayed longer. The service was great. Friendly, welcoming, it made you want to stay a while. I'm really glad we gave this place another try. Seems like they have a good crew in there this time around.

I am writing this based on their running gear since this is why I usually shop here. I keep trying and I'm constantly disappointed. I rarely find what I'm looking for. I think they have more "work-out" clothes and not real "running" clothes such as compression gear and multiple styles to suit every runner. If I'm looking for capris they only have shorts. If I'm looking for running skirts-forget it they don't carry them. I have also been disappointed in their selection of running sports bras and they tend to run out of sizes fast as well. If you are looking for running gear, save yourself the trip. I thought the prices would be better here being a big chain, but then I found what I was looking for at a real running store for less money.

Pattie's is always a fun place to hang out. It's like a local dive spot but without the pretense. Casual, fun, no-frills, cheap drinks. Now that it's warm out I love the fact that they have the open ceiling in the front.  Many nights I've been there, they've had a band playing, and they always celebrate the holidays with flare!

My computer became very ill last weekend. I know NOTHING about computers. I asked people. I tried a zillion free scans to clean it up. I was confused, distraught, scared about what I'd have to pay to get it fixed!   The only computer guys I know about are geek squad at best buy, but I know that they are expensive and charge you for diagnostic work. The thought was making me ill as well......  So be it the glorious thing that it is I Yelped computer support and saw these guys with such great reviews! They also do free estimates! How awesome! They were totally wonderful. I dropped it off on Thurs after work and they called that evening with the diagnosis and repair cost. $150 to restore it back to healthy and $50 to back up my stuff. It's still cheaper than a new laptop so I said go for it.   I picked it up today and they were friendly and helpful. Made it super fast and got rid of not only the virus but also the other junk that came with the computer that you never use. They also installed an antivirus program from microsoft and said it would work forever, I'd never have to re-install anything or pay for anymore spyware/antivirus stuff. I almost hugged him. Thank you!!!

Now I'm convinced my computer hates me. These guys fixed it about a year ago and for the past few months I've been having a different problem. Great.  I dropped it off around 3:30 in the afternoon and they called me 6:30 that night with their diagnosis. They said it wasn't a major problem. They did explain it to me but since I don't speak computer all I heard was "wha wha wha...wha".  How much? $25 for this evidently small problem. Ok that's doable. Once again they were timely, professional, good customer service. Thanks!

I have been to Road Runner a few times for specific items like an IT-Band brace or to pick up a race packet, but never to really shop for clothing. I assumed the prices would be high since it's a specialty shop. I ended up here after I couldn't find what I was looking for at a sporting goods store. They sell their own brand of running gear, as well as name brands, and have pretty competitive prices. You can purchase a membership card for $20 and get the "member' price on items which is a little cheaper. This might be worth it if you are making a bigger purchase like shoes but I passed on it as I was just buying some running pants.  The sales staff always seems very friendly in here-like they really like their job--and that's nice when that comes across in their customer service. They have turned me into a new fan and I'd certainly return next time for my running needs. They also seem very involved in the community hosting group runs and packet pick ups. I even took a free class here before I did the Susan G. Komen 3-day.

I tried this location for the first time since its' partnering with the Old Town Scottsdale location. This studio is gorgeous! Very clean, no crowding at the desk, easy check in. I love the shoe cubbies and wall hooks along the corridor outside of class. There's plenty of space to store a few things yet it doesn't get super crowded since there is enough room. I didn't use the locker room but peeked in to check them out. Again, very clean and plenty of showers.  The studio itself had better lighting and ventilation compared to their partner, and their carpet didn't seem as "slippery" when doing certain postures such as triangle.  The instructor has a box-type platform to stand on and a microphone so it's easy to hear him/her no matter where you are in the room. I wish I was closer to this location!!!

We were headed to a different lunchtime spot on Central and spotted Maizie's on the way. Initially we pulled over just to grab a menu but since it looked pretty good we opted to spend our Saturday lunch there. They have both indoor and outdoor seating and it was such a nice day to sit on the patio. They have a few interesting options for cocktails. My husband ordered a bloody mary which was a bargain at $3. I normally don't care for mary's but it was really good! I'm completely blanking out on the cocktail I ordered....had ginger beer, rum and candied ginger in it....well never mind the name, let's just call it awesome!! They have lots of sandwiches, salads, pizzas, etc. I ordered the caprese panini and my husband ordered the portobello sandwich. I was totally jealous once I saw his sandwich, but mine was just as tasty. Both had a nice crispy bread, fresh spinach/veggies, gooey cheese..... They offer a lot of side options to accompany your sandwiches: regular or sweet potato fries, fruit, cottage cheese, soup, or salad. Just a hint: get the sweet potato fries!! They were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and had a generous sprinkling of salt and pepper. Just mouth-stuffingly good!!! Our server was friendly and checked on us frequently. All in all a great little lunch spot!!!!

We checked out this county animal shelter over the weekend in the hopes to find us a new dog. I have to admit I got a little choked up. This is the reality. For anyone who actually buys a dog, please know there are so many animals here who need a home!  I wish I could say it was a cushy spot for these animals, but the reality is it's just the basics. They rely a lot on donations for blankets and supplies and have a lot of help from volunteers. Yes, there was crap in some of the cages, but I think the employees and volunteers try to keep up and do the best they can. We saw a few of them spring into action when a new mother got sick and needed her cage cleaned out so she could nurse her puppies. The volunteer who helped us took each dog we wanted to see out back into their fenced in area so we could interact with them.  The who process was very easy. We filled out the application and whatever info they know about the dog (usually not much, if anything) is disclosed. They also give out a list of vets who will provide a free wellness exams for adopted pets. $60 later she was ours! Hey it's a county shelter, so there are no guarantees, but if you really want to help out and adopt a pet it's worth taking look!

This was based on my experience last Saturday for St. Patrick's Day. A friend was at another bar in North Scottsdale with live music and a $10 cover, but we opted to head to D'Arcy McGee's as it was closer to home, no cover, and also boasted of live music. Cut to scene..... We expected it to be crowded, as it should be on days like this, but service and quality shouldn't be lacking or otherwise what's the point? Surprisingly the hostess seated us right away, which was a delightful surprise. Flip that around though, that it took our server a good solid 10 min to acknowledge our existence. After apologizing she was friendly and polite and did check on us if we needed anything, but she failed the water glass test. Beers were horribly flat, was something wrong with the tap? Screwing up beer at an Irish bar on St. Patrick's Day is blasphemous. Our fish and chips tasted like they opened up a box of Gordon's and stuck it in the oven, and the few chips on the plate weren't worth the calories. Oh, did I mention there was no music?  Our experience didn't make me want to come back on another night.

I had bought a restaurant.com gift cert for this place so we decided to try it out friday night. It's a small eatery in an Indian "plaza". Once seated I immediately noticed the pewter-style dish and water cup on the table. Not the norm so it was a nice, unique touch.   We ordered a vegetarian-style appetizer platter with fried cheese, potato-filled dumplings, and other veggie delights. It was amazing!   My man ordered the vegetable-dumpling stew and I ordered the kidney beans. We got an order of basmati rice and garlic naan to go with it. With all of this and the crispy thing you get in the beginning (I'm not sure what it's called), we were stuffed and had leftovers for lunch the next day. Our water glasses were repeatedly refilled, which is always a plus for me.    The menu is huge but broken down into veggie options, chicken, lamb, etc. I've been to other Indian restaurants where the food was equally good, but I enjoy the different touches such as the dinnerware. Not to mention the attentive service.  We'll be back!

A little less than a year ago I started going to Salon Krush after I had to "break up" with my former hairstylist. (C'mon she didn't own a flat iron). I got an appointment with Ashley and I've been super happy with her ever since. She's always upbeat, has incredible style, and always compliments me on my hair even though she's cutting it.   The salon itself is cute. I like the color scheme and the small, coziness about it. I have to think about what would Tabitha Coffee say about all the stuff they have for sale in the front-is this a salon or an accessories boutique? The receptionist usually asks you if you'd like something to drink, which is a nice touch.   I never get pushed for product either. Which, I appreciate. If I need something I'll ask, I dont' like when a salon tries to push too hard to sell you something and then you feel obligated to buy something too expensive.   A womens' cut and style is $60 which I find reasonable. I can usually get an appointment within the week I call. The local artwork for sale on the wall adds a neat touch too.

While in the area we wanted something for lunch but knew we'd be having dinner out that same evening. Not wanting to fill up too much we ordered an appetizer and entree to share.  The lettuce wraps with shrimp were so good! Fresh and crispy veggies accompanied seasoned shrimp all wrapped in butter lettuce leaves. It was light and tasty. For our entree we ordered the Hawaiian mahi mahi which came with a pineapple, red pepper and onion mixture over a bed of rice. The fish was a little overcooked but still tasted pretty good. Star for the water glass test!

Lavo is located inside the Palazzo, right on the strip. It has a little bit of everything on the menu: pasta, pizza, fish, meat. The inside is dim, dark wood, lanterns, and would have a romantic feel if it wasn't so loud-the music that is. We opted to sit outside on the terrace as it was a beautiful night. Everything on the menu looks great by the way. It's a la carte style so my friend and I ordered the calamari to start, the branzino and the ahi tuna for our entrees,  the mushrooms, and polenta "fries". The calamari was fresh, crispy, plump yet lightly battered and served with the most amazing marinara. They also brought some garlic bread to the table served with the same marinara sauce. Did I mention how much I love good marinara? Theirs was awesome too, I was in love. Our fish was cooked wonderfully. The mushrooms were tender, yet had crispy edges that made them so tasty. The polenta fries were one of the most creative plates I've seen in a long time. Essentially, these garlicky, buttery, seasoned, soft polenta delights were formed into large rectangular "fries" (there were four in an order) coated in breadcrumbs and fried like a mozzarella stick. Then, they were served with that amazing sauce. They were my favorite item of the evening.  Their signature dessert is the fried oreos. We were full but didn't want to miss out on their signature dish. They were very, very good, but since I've had fried oreos at the state fair many times, they weren't a novel idea, nor much different. So, if you haven't ever tried them, get them, but if the concept isn't new to you you can try something different. Service was great. My water glass was full all night, empty plates cleared promptly, and our server offered some great suggestions on where to go out later that evening. The whole dining experience was just that, an experience, and a great one.

What a cool place!!! We went here with some friends and ordered about two plates a piece and shared. The plates are small and it gave us the opportunity to try a bunch of different things. My favorites were the red curry with tofu, the tofu wasabi, and the pad thai with shrimp. It wasn't a typical pad thai I've had before, had more of a broth and very fine, thin noodles, but so tasty!  We didn't happen to partake in their drink menu, but it looked pretty extensive-more drink options than food! Instead we downed their cucumber infused water as the spiciness of the food left us sweating a bit. (We of course couldn't help but keep eating though). Decor is modern-asian-IKEA-meets-Budha-palace. Simple, small place, they have an outdoor patio but oddly enough it was actually raining when we went!  Service was prompt, kept our water filled, and offered some suggestions. Very cool place!

The menu is fantastic. Healthy, organic, simple dishes that are portioned well. There were many items that I wanted to try, so I'll have to go back. I decided on the ahi tuna sliders with kale salad and my friend got the spaghetti squash casserole. We also ordered "the natural" to drink which is one of their fresh "elixirs". This one was made with ginger, agave and soda water. We each had two. We both enjoyed our meals very much-I have no idea what type of dressing was on that kale salad, but I think I liked that the best. The staff was very nice and attentive, they also let us sit and chat after we paid the check without giving us dirty looks. The decor is simple and spa-like with an open floor plan. They also validate if your park in the lot out front.

How wonderful that us desert dwellers can come here and enjoy a little aquatic "therapy"! Tempe Beach Park is home to various festivals and gatherings, but it's also a nice place to come on a quiet day and just enjoy the view. They have bathrooms nearby and you're right near all the Mill Ave restaurants if you get hungry. It's a great place to jog, bike ride, etc. The water park for kids is open right now, and if you can get a shady spot you can picnic too.  Today we tried stand up paddle boarding from the local rental kiosk. Sometimes it's easy to forget all of our local community activities that are there all the time!

I used to visit this farmers market weekly a few years ago, but at some point McClendon Farms pulled out and it just wasn't the same. Now they are back and it's more awesome than EVER!! McClendon farms has the BEST produce and their organics are clearly marked. They occasionally have a chef available as well so you can feel comfortable trying a new produce item and asking the chef for cooking suggestions! Conveniently, they also take credit cards now without hassle.  The rest of the market has blown up too! Many more tents selling everything from flowers, bread, jams, pet treats, fish, cheese, etc. Lots of people strolling around with a coffee and pastry. It's also dog friendly too. Wonderful place to visit!!!

I remember this place having a decent breakfast but we hadn't been in a while. My husband and I decide to come on a Saturday morning. I'm not sure if they were ill prepared for this particular Saturday, or if this was the norm, but the service was disorganized, and almost nonexistent. There was no one at the hostess station when we arrived. After about 2 minutes someone noticed us and seated us, but then brought no menus. A different server arrived about 10 min later and asked if we needed menus. I said yes, no one has been over yet. She asked if we just walked in and seated us ourselves and we said no, someone seated us here. So yet a third person arrived, to take our drink and food orders. She brought our water and coffee but we waited quite a long time for our food to arrive, and breakfast foods usually arrive very quickly so it seemed unusual.  The kicker was that no one came back ever to check on us so when my husband wanted a refill on his coffee he had to get up and get it himself. During a Saturday morning breakfast service, I find this absurd. A coffee cup should never go empty, just like a water glass.  Yes, the food was good, but as I've said before, I have food at home that I can cook myself. I pay money to eat out for the ambiance, convenience, and good service as well as the food. If service is poor I'm not going to bother going back for my time and money.

Marshalls is like Ross or TJ Maxx, it's a hit or miss depending on the styles and what's in stock. Today I wasn't really impressed with the selection, but can't blame Marshalls for what's currently in style.  I've had great luck during other trips and Marshalls is always a great place to go for cheap designer accessories like shoes, bags, and glasses.  You have to want to search the racks and spend a little time, but when you find that bargain that is the best!

Finally we tried this place! Each time we've walked by it we always comment "oh we need to try that place!".  Located in Old Town Scottsdale on the brink of the civic center mall, it sits below sidewalk level. Inside and outside seating make for great people watching and although it was small inside, it had a cozy feel. They have a decent beer list and even when I ordered a house red wine the bartender gave me a choice of three! The staff had a good attitude, welcoming, by no means stand-offish. The way you sometimes get from small bars when you're there for the first time.  I enjoyed myself, and my wine thank you very much.

I heard it was great-now I can confirm it. Gorgeous place-you have your dance floor and bars, but it's also open to the outside so you have your pool and cabanas if dancing is not your thing and just want to lounge and look cool. We hit the dance floor all night-awesome music.   After a few drinks, the bartender actually gave us water for free when we requested it. Usually Vegas bars charge you even for water! Can I also mention ladies, that this was the only nightclub I've EVER been to where each time we visited the ladies room there was no line. Yes you read that correctly. The place was packed too but somehow there must have been a few bathrooms because we never had to wait.   I would absolutely return next time I'm in Vegas!!

Have eaten here for dinner, decided to try their brunch. Again, I love the decor: clean lines, crisp, contemporary. Brunch menu looked creative and promising. I ordered the egg sliders, my man got the blueberry pancakes and we shared the fruit side dish. The food was delicious and the coffee divine.    The consistently weird thing about this place is the lack of staff....it's eerie. The host is also the waiter, and also the bartender. The food took a little long, for breakfast sake-and considering we were the 2nd couple in there that morning. However, he was very attentive with refilling our coffee and water-a big plus in my book.

My usual beef about this place is that it always looks disheveled and the registers are under-maned. This afternoon, the store was neatly organized, and for once there wasn't a huge line at the registers. I'm convinced there are some people who look great in Old Navy clothes, and I wish I did because their stuff is inexpensive, trendy, and kind of cute. However, no matter how many times I give them a try, nothing seems to work out. I find their brand ill-fitting and with generally flimsy fabrics which don't last too long after multiple washings.  Their relatively new athletic line has a few pieces worth checking out: sports bras and yoga tops are pretty good.

On a Friday afternoon the line wasn't too bad. There were two tellers open  but as I was in line a lady opened the side half-door and waited on me. The postal tellers at this location always seem to be friendly and helpful. Most times I use the automated postal machine and I like that it's available after hours.

I'm always a little skeptical about Greek places as my mom is from Greece and I've been several times. I know Greek food and no one is going to make it like mom, right? Right. So having said this, I can still appreciate tasty food-which this was. The tzatziki was a little watery, although had a good flavor and was nicely served with lightly toasted warm pita. The Greek fries were addictive-although real Greek fries have only salt, pepper, oregano and lemon juice, and are hand-cut thick suckers, not thin McDonald style. I had a felafel pita which is not Greek, but more middle-eastern.....I know it's not sounding very authentic is it. It was good though! For what it was it was tasty food and worth going too. Especially late at night I can see digging into a plate of those fries! So henceforth I still give it four stars. Not because of it's "authenticity" but because it was inexpensive, tasty, quick, and when I asked them they sold me one of their t-shirts because I just had to have something that said "greeklicious" on it. Awesome.

This place does have a large selection of cruiser bikes for both men and women, and a range of prices and accessories as well. When I originally purchased a cruiser bike for my husband the sales associate wasn't pushy, which I appreciated, he mentioned a few times that I could always return it if I changed my mind. He FAILED to mention a restocking fee which comes into play later......   A different associate loaded the bike into my truck for me and I brought it to a friends house to stash it until our Anniversary. It was then he noticed a few scratches I hadn't seen. Upon calling the store they made it seem like it was no problem to bring it in and exchange the bike or touch up the paint. Hey, it's a gift so it should look perfect when you're presenting it brand new right?  Problem was, once the bike was brought down to the store, the associate was NO help. He said he couldn't fix the paint because he didn't have the right color, couldn't exchange it because there wasn't another one, and suggested using a sharpie.....you heard me right. Oh, and if you return the bike they wanted some 20% re-stocking fee for them to put it back on the rack. Please!!!!   That's when my friend and I decided to try our luck at the University location and had a MUCH better customer service experience. You can read my review for their location.    I've brought my own cruiser to this Rural Rd. location in the past for minor fix-its and they always seem to have a lackluster attitude and customer service approach that seems to say "we don't really care about you or your bike". I think I've got the message loud and clear.

Went here for happy hour which they do from 3-6 M-Thurs. Our table ordered $5 margaritas and the sangria, which were both very good.  Ordered the chips and salsa which came with pico and a nice chipotle salsa.  We tried about 4 varieties of tacos and we liked the shrimp and veggie tacos the best. The corn on the cob with cotija cheese was almost decadent, as well as the ensalada cortada which was such a delicious and interesting salad with all its' textural components. Our friend ordered the pork quesadilla as well which she said was seasoned nicely.  We finished our meal with the postres de chocolate.  The service was great. Prompt and although we had a main waitress, we had multiple people filling our water and bringing our food out. We never felt neglected or forgotten. Cute decor too in the old Clarendon Hotel!

Despite newly begun renovations to the MGM Grand, the Centrifuge is still open and a cool place to sit and have a cocktail while waiting for a show or looking to relax. We arrived a little early before our Cirque show and hung out here for cocktails. The apply named circular bar has central seating around the bar, and lounge type seating around the perimeter. TVs along the bar allowed us to watched live footage from the IHEART Radio concert last weekend, although the picture kept pixelating as if slowly streaming through......... They have a pretty good menu of mixed cocktails and the mood was low key and kind of dark (lighting wise) on this particular Saturday night. Good service.

I love love love Yogurtland! The whole concept of serve yourself yogurt just appeals to me....maybe it's the sampling!! I love being able to try as many different flavors as you want, and just get them yourself. After all, if you have to ask for the samples, how many do we try...one? Maybe two? Exactly.  They always have really good flavors, especially the "desserts" like NY cheesecake or red velvet cake. Mmmmmmm Fill up your cup, sprinkle on a few toppings, weigh, pay and instant happiness!  They always seem to keep the place clean too, and have fresh berry-infused water to serve yourself.

From one Bettie Page store to the next! The ladies at the Miracle Mile store called over and there was a dress on hold for me at this store. So we walked over and whoa! This store is beautiful and much bigger. They had the dress for me and after trying it on I bought it. Is it crazy to say that I also love how they wrap their items in leopard tissue paper? 'Cause, I do.

Another one of my must visits each and every time I come to Vegas. Even though you can buy Bettie Page clothing from their website, it's fun to peruse the store and try things on. The ladies are always so helpful and friendly. They have great vintage remakes and generally carry a variety of sizes. Sometimes sizes sell out so you can always have them call the Miracle Mile store to check for you. The store is always neat and colorful. I love all the new handbags too!

I have a new favorite seafood restaurant in the valley...and it is the Bluewater Grill. We tried this place during restaurant week and had such a great experience I can't say enough positive things.  First off decor: walking in the entrance on boarded planks is like walking on a pier into a beachside establishment. There is a fish market counter when you first walk-in, so immediately I though-this place must be legit! There is nothing about the inside decor that says "southwest". With all of its' hardwood finishing, it really did feel like I was back home in Boston. Our server was spot on all evening. He was courteous, knowledgeable, and professional. He kept our water filled which always earns a star from me, and just made sure we had whatever we needed.  We ordered the ahi tuna and crab cakes for our starters, the miso-glazed salmon and mahi mahi for our entrees, and the key lime pie and caramel chocolate bread pudding for dessert. Each bite was better than the next. Some highlights were the daikon salad that accompanied the ahi, and the risotto cake with the mahi mahi! Heavenly. The fish was cooked so beautifully.  After glancing at the regular menu and their prices, they are very reasonably priced compared to their competition-yet still high quality. I'm very excited to return here again!

Finally decided to try the famous leeks at FnB. Ok, let me back up a moment. The restaurant is tiny! After speaking with the hostess once we got there, I learned that the only way we got a reservation on the same Friday evening I called was that someone canceled. Luck was on our side.  We ordered a few small plates: the leeks, the brussel sprouts, and the falafel. My husband ordered a SunBrew which the runner brought out in the can, with the glass and poured for him. I kind of liked that. I ordered a gin cocktail, the name escapes me, which seemed VERY light on the gin. no good, don't skimp a lady on her cocktail. My favorite was the falafel for its' crunchy-on-the-outside-creamy-on-the-inside texture, which our server boasted were made to order. The leaks with homemade mozzarella and fried egg were fantastic. Although I agree with my husband, they were more cheesy, than....leeky. I'm not complaining though, as it is blasphemous to say anything has too much cheese. This is not possible. My first experience with brussel sprouts was a positive one, though I didn't much care for the warm grapes that accompanied them.  A couple things on service.....our server was very nice and  explained the menu well. However he never once returned after we received out plates to check in if everything was ok. I also got a strange feeling that we weren't "ordering enough" for him. Three small plates, two cocktails, I mean we don't eat meat and there was only one fish entree on the menu anyways. Maybe it was just me, but that's what brought my rating down to four stars.

Went with a friend for Happy Hour last night which runs from 3-6 M-F. Beer and Wells $4, glass wine $5, specialty cocktails $7 (some are usually $10). Apps run between $3-6. We tried a bunch of items: french fries (delicious), fried pickles (super crispy but extremely salty), hummus plate (delicious), and fig/brie/pear plate (disappointing under-ripe pears, lack luster dried figs). My friend got a couple beers. I opted for a Luna martini, which was tasty, and the pomegranate martini which was so medicinal tasting for some reason I couldn't finish it.  They have an outdoor patio but we opted for inside where cool local art is displayed on the walls. I don't know the name of the artist, but I've seen his stuff at one of the local galleries: cartoon-esque dogs done in a bright color palette. Fun and whimsical.  Service was prompt and although we made it in only 20 min before HH ended, our server made sure to come around a 2nd time to get a last min order before 6:00. After looking back at my receipt I realized downing those two drinks quickly resulted in leaving her a hefty tip. Oh well, that was smart on her part then!

Beautiful! A hidden gem. I would never have known about this place if I hadn't seen a photo in Food & Wine magazine. We visited the Tea Lounge and enjoyed a stunning view of the Vegas strip.   They have a large selection of loose leaf teas organized by calming, rejuvenating, healing properties, etc.  The tea is brewed for you and served in a personal teapot perched atop a candle warmer. Lemon and honey are served along with various sugars. We ordered pastries to accompany our teas: a German chocolate cupcake, red velvet cupcake, and scones & jam.   The tea was purifying, the treats delightful, and the service professional and polite. The hotel decor is so artistic and simple. I found myself taking numerous photos of the lobby wall, our coffee table, the ottomans, etc. We enjoyed every minute.   note: we ordered off the a la carte menu, but during 2:30-5:00 you can participate in English tea service with miniature pastries, tea sandwiches for $40.

I did the Las Vegas Rock n Roll years ago when it was on a Sunday morning at 7am. That was NO comparison to the vibrancy and fun of running the strip at night! First of all, now Vegas offers all these runner perks for the weekend. There are spa specials (although still too expensive for me), food and drink specials, and free entrance to some of the Vegas clubs for pre and post runner parties.  This year I opted to run as an "Elvi" which was really fun to meet up with some other Elvis runners and take pictures at the expo. The Expo was pretty good too, although I've noticed some sponsors have pulled out from the Rock and Rolls, too bad, I liked their freebies. Brooks was there with their huge interactive display and there was a lot of RnR souvenirs for purchase.  Since the run is at night they did a start line festival with All American Rejects, rather than a finish line festival. I see the point, but no one was really paying much attention to the band when they first started to play and the location was a boring dirt field. Meh, I had Elvis activities to attend to anyways.  The course for the half was great-the spectator support was the best for any RnR I've done  in 6 states. People were all over the overpasses and along the sidewalks cheering on the runners-it was fantastic!  The finish line ended in front of the Mirage and then we walked down past Caesar's to collect our medal and snacks. It was kind of a long walk when you're tired though and there was a lot of backlog getting our medals.  That being said it was still the most fun RnR I've done and definitely would return again!!!

We participated in one of their "Adult Education" nights last Friday. For $29pp (we were lucky enough to have a 2 for 1 coupon) you get dinner, endless drinks, live music, some type of team building activity (we had a salsa challenge) and trips on the tequila bus!!  They offer alternatives to driving home and ask you during sign up how you are getting home, which is great. You can either stay in a local hotel, get a ride home in your own car for $50, or camp for free on the grounds! We opted to camp, and although there are no shower facilities the bathrooms are open all night. We arrived about an hour before the event to set up our tents, which I would recommend if you're going that route.  What a fun, goofy night!

Wanted a place to hang out on a Saturday night with a cool bar. This was it. I had stopped in here once before on a bike pub crawl but we were drinking the sponsored beer. So I didn't get to sample some of their cocktails.   The decor is cool and stylish, and yet doesn't look like it's trying too hard. The oversized chandeliers fit right in. The bar is very cool-has both sides accessible to indoor/outdoor seating and their cocktail menu is organized by your favorite libations. If you prefer gin/vodka drinks, there's a section for those. Scotch? Tequila? Yup a section for those. I tried the Velvet Death and the lil icharus. My friend ordered the Hall Pass and the Smashed Irishman (the velvet death and hall pass were our two favorites). The drinks aren't cheap, around $10 each but they pack a punch so at least you feel you're getting your money's worth.   Our bartender was attentive and witty and proceeded to put two guys in their place after they commented about her pouring methods. Rock on.

Wow, I'm back here again! Enjoyed cocktails and live music with some friends on Saturday night. I thought our out-of-town guests might like this place and I was glad when they immediately commented about how cool and pretty the bar was. That's one of the reasons I really like it here. I went for the Velvet Death again, it was so good last time, but this time the bartender squeezed a lemon rind over the glass so that the citric acid sparked and emitted a wonderful lemon scent. How cool! Thank you! My girlfriend took my recommendation on the Hall Pass and our guys went with manly beers. Great place!

When we arrived we were told the wait would be about 45-60 min. Rather than give you one of those flashing plastic discs they offered to text us when our table was ready. After barely getting drinks at the bar we had a table ready-which only took about 10 min!  Our server was very friendly and made recommendations from the menu-which were great! We weren't looking for full entrees, just something lighter. So she suggested the pretzel bread fondue and something from their antipasti menu. I had only heard of the pretzel bread appetizer......now I know why the legend lives!!! It was amazing!  She kept our water glasses full, which I always appreciate, and we had a great night.

I planned a surprise party dinner for my husband here on Saturday night. Two months ago I called and spoke to one of the managers who was very helpful in answering my questions and assisting me with the reservation. I called back twice during this time period to update the party size and each time whomever answered the phone was very nice. Of note, I also emailed their website re: parties at the FOX Restaurants and the person who emailed me back was a great help very as well.   When my husband and I arrived our large table was set up by the front door so he immediately got an eyeful of all our friends wishing him happy birthday! It was great. Our server didn't rush us at all yet still was able to manage bringing drinks and food to our table of 11 with a good attitude. Water carafes were on the table as well so we didn't have to keep asking her. Some menu highlights were of course the pretzel bites (if you don't order these you're making a big life mistake), and the homemade potato chips and dip were very tasty as well. I ordered the rainbow trout with green beans and almonds and it was so incredibly tasty! I would certainly get it again. My husband got a birthday dessert on the house and our server was able to separate checks by couples which is so much easier with a large party.   Once again a great experience here! That's what keeps me coming back!

Ever since my stylist left the business I've been a lost soul with a bad haircut. After two failed attempts elsewhere I discovered The Roose in Elle magazine. I'm not into expensive haircuts, I'm even a home-color girl, but you still want to leave there feeling good that your cut was done well.  The Roose is a converted house downtown with plenty of street parking. It's small and cozy and I guess they offer an array of spa services as well. My only negative was that, as a first impression, it was fairly dirty. Not just hair on the floor from the day but back around behind the mirrors and baseboards, like it hadn't been cleaned in a while. I wasn't sure where to put my purse as there was hair everywhere. My appt was with Lisa and I told her from the start how my last haircut left me scraggly. She began her game plan much different from recent cuts I've had, so I patiently waited for the magic. Then she explained to me why she was cutting the way she was, and how the previous stylist must have approached it. She was right!  It's funny how in the shop the cut seems to look good, but it's when you get home and play with it a little that you find the mistakes. Not this time! Great haircut and they even offer 10% off for first time clients!

I was tipped off about this place for their fish tacos and salsa bar. I was expecting a divey taco joint but was pleasantly surprised with their old-world style decor: wooden floors and tables, heavy metal chairs, Mexican-inspired art, hand-made pottery plates with their name painted on, and the wooden bar all added a cool vibe to the place, albeit small.  Space is very limited and most of their tables accommodate 2 persons. We watched several couples who walked in after us, get seated before us as we were waiting for two tables to open up in order to be able to seat our party of four.  A basket of chips was brought over immediately and you can then go up to their salsa bar and sample as many as you like. The variety is amazing and it's fun to try so many different types ranging from very spicy to slightly sweet.  The menu looks good all around. Tacos, burrito-bowls, tortas which they call lortas, etc. You can order a la carte or as a meal with rice and beans. We opted for the tacos and I tried the vegan, the veggie, and the dogfish shark. I ordered three expecting them to be really small, but I was only able to finish about two! All three were delicious and fresh tasting. Can't wait to go back and sample a few other menu items! Service was polite, and prompt. I love that they leave a bottle of water on your table for you so we never had to wait for more refills.

I've eaten here 3 times. It's become a staple each time we visit Vegas and stay at the IP. We first saw it featured on Man vs. Food for their huge portions and they are not kidding. I've made my meals last 3-4 servings. I've tried the mango-coconut pancake, the goat cheese scramble, and most recently the veggie hash. All awesome. Their biscuits are divine and about the size of a large softball.   There is always a wait so anticipate that or get there early. The value is very reasonable considering your meal is about 4 serving sizes. I've never had their fancy cocoas and coffee drinks but they always look good on the menu. Service is always friendly and prompt considering the wait to be seated.    A can't-miss breakfast place.

Thank goodness this place hasn't gone anywhere! The Imperial Palace where it's housed is turning into the Quad so I was nervous that I'd lose my beloved Hash House. This place continues to be one of the best eateries in Vegas. It's my consistent breakfast haven for excellent, fresh, tasty food in eye popping portions! Bring your appetite, stretchy pants and be prepared to EAT.  Their veggie hash is one of my favorites but this time I got the brown sugar and banana pancake. This thing needs to come with a side of insulin. The brown sugar is fantastically crispy and caramelized and the bananas soft and sweet-you don't even need syrup on this thing! Since I LOVE sweets though it was perfect!!!  Had a great server who kept us filled with water and coffee and had a great attitude and politeness. I love this place!!

Our first time at Culvers, and it was a great 107* day for it! The girl at the counter took the liberty of explaining the frozen custard choices as we stood there with our blank stares.....what to get? They have a flavor of the day, as well as chocolate and vanilla. Then you can get a shake, sundae, cone or mixer (kind of like a blizzard at DQ). I opted for the mint and oreo and my husband got peanut butter cups and bananas.  We paid under $7 for two smalls. They give you a number, you find a table and they bring you your custard! Hooray!!

I'm always a little skeptical when I walk into a restaurant on a Friday or Saturday night and it's almost empty. That's never a good sign. However, Mijana proved to be a great new place for tasty, ethnic food that has lots of vegetarian options. My husband ordered a spiced lentil dish and I got the vegetarian moussaka. Both came with some rice and a side salad. I really enjoyed my meal and even ate the leftovers for breakfast the next morning! Service was friendly, but since I only saw one server, and maybe one trainee, it got a little sparse once a large birthday group was seated next to our table. I had a hard time getting water refills and had to wait quite a while for the missing tzatziki that should have come with my dinner.  Belly dancing entertainment livened up the place and apparently there was going to be salsa lessons later that night.  Decent prices for the portion sizes. Oh, and the bread and dipping sauce they brought at the beginning of the meal was amazing!

Since we usually have to stay somewhere unimpressive that allows dogs,  this hotel seemed like a palace!   Clean room Comfy king bed with lots of pillows Nice bathroom with big shower and good water pressure Free wi-fi It was quiet Nice continental breakfast with healthy options!! Digital thermostat (because I'm always cold)  It's also very close to Westgate and the Tanger Outlets!!!

Lingerie stores can be great places for Halloween accessories! I stopped in here looking for white shorts or something to wear under a short costume. Funny, was in here last Halloween looking for something similar...  Well, on both occasions the women in the store were so friendly and helpful!  They really have a huge selection of clothing, lingerie, shoes, accessories and the customer service is great.

I had gotten a couple tattoos at Divinity when they were in Old Town. After they disappeared from that location I thought they were gone forever.....so glad I found them again up on Cactus.  Divinity is more of an art studio. The shop is filled with original paintings and sculptures, and oodles of tattoo awards. You can peruse through portfolios, but you will find no flash here my friend. If you are looking to pick and stick a tattoo this is not the place for you.  In my case I was looking to coverup an arm band (what can I say I got it in the 90's) and I was really impressed with Nathan Z's color work.  He and I discussed the concept I was looking for and the game plan for working out a floral half sleeve piece.  After six sessions it's done, with one session remaining for final touch up. I'm very pleased with it and it covers my original arm band really well.  Great experience with this shop and this tattoo artist, I highly recommend them!

I guess I just can't stay away. What began as a half-sleeve cover-up has now started creeping down my arm into a 3/4, courtesy of Nathan. Once again this shop maintains a level of professionalism that I always appreciate. It's always clean, including the bathroom, there is always someone at the front desk, and they do appt reminders. They have also now made the back studio for clients and artists only, no guests. Which I really appreciate since no client wants someones creepy friend hanging out back there stairing at you while you've got a body part exposed and you're getting inked. Am I right?? I think most of us ladies have been in this situation.  Once again, great experience all around. Highly recommended!

I was in the area and really wanted a pedicure. My husband was with me, and although I'd NEVER drag him into a nail salon regularly, we were celebrating my birthday and doing things I liked so he was a great sport and accompanied me in.   As I was sitting in the chair I began reading some of the yelp reviews. Previous yelpers were right! It was very clean and the service was good. After I got set up in the chair, the nail tech asked if my husband wanted to sit next to me in a massage chair, which was nice of him to offer. So he saddled on in and got to check his phone and watch a Bruce Willis movie on the tv.  My nail tech did a great job! So many times when I've gotten a pedicure I'm disappointed with the massage part (which we all know is the best part), but it was relaxing and they even wiped off any extra lotion so as not to leave my skin too greasy. The polish came out very nice and they gave me some oh-so-stylish disposable slippers to walk out in.   Great place!!

I bought a groupon for a cooking class at Benedict's Cafe and Catering. Once I started looking at the class schedule list I was really impressed by the variety of classes! My oh my what to choose?! Since knife skills is something I've been wanting to brush up on I decided on Knife Skills I.   The class was scheduled from 3-7 on a Saturday afternoon. I showed up at 2:45 only to be told the class was moved to 4pm. Hmmmm I was a little annoyed as I drove quite a ways and didn't have time to drive back home and back to class. Dawn was so nice and apologetic though, offering me options for places to hang out until class time.   I returned at 4 and Lisa was the chef teaching our knife class. She offered us tea, water or coffee and explained a few things about the kitchen. She started off explaining the basics of knife care ie) sharpening, honing, which cutting boards are better than others, etc.   As this is the basics class we were going to learn how to make traditional cuts using a potato, celery, carrot, and onion. Lisa showed us the how-to and we followed along with opportunity to practice and ask questions. There were only 3 of us in the class which was a perfect size as we all stood around the work station together and could see what she was doing. The pace seemed to move well, and Lisa even made us an egg and veggie frittata to snack on.   Great class, I'm very interested in returning for Knife Skills II!

One of the most gorgeous hotels on the strip! Hip, pretty, and an opulent feel......ahhh it's Vegas. The staff was wonderfully helpful when we asked where the restaurant was that we had our reservation. We had dinner at Milos and then went downstairs to the Chandelier bar for cocktails.  Loooove the decor in here. What a cool place to hang out!

During this weekend Vegas trip we stopped by the Cosmopolitan both Friday and Saturday nights. It's one of my favorite Vegas spots and a must visit. The crowd is generally young and hip. The staff is professional and helpful. Beautiful, gorgeous decor. They know how to do Vegas justice.

This was my first time trying this place and it was on New Years' Eve so it was very empty at 7pm. Decor isn't exciting, but the bathrooms are very clean.  The menu has a large variety so there is plenty to choose from. I liked how many of the entrees offer the choice of tofu and seafood, and not just chicken/beef/pork.  I ordered the ginger fish with a steamed fillet and my husband ordered the drunken noodles with tofu. We split the fresh rolls and he also got a Thai tea.  The food took a little while, but as I was sitting there I was thinking-I bet they are making all this stuff fresh, from scratch. That must have been the case because everything looked and tasted delicious, which made it all worth it.

Meh, nice patio but lackluster service if it's busy. I don't think we're cool enough to hang here, at least that's how they made us feel, and no one should feel that way as a paying customer. Not worth a return trip.

This was my first time attending Devoured, and I needed it to be good.  Since CRAVE was postponed, then canceled, then a hassel to get our refund, I was looking for a great new tasting event to sink my teeth into.   Devoured was fantastic. What an amazing location to be held in the sculptural garden at the Phoenix Art Museum. The restaurants and wineries represented did a great job at keeping the food and drinks flowing. I think everyone there also appreciated the bottled fuji water coolers around the event as the sun got a little warm.   Some of my favorites included the chocolate-peanut butter mouse dessert from Arogant Butcher, the goatsmilk cheese and tomato jam bruschetta at Postinos, and the vegan buffalo wing from Green Restaurant.    I will definitely be back next year!

Another year, another Devoured! What a great event! Still located at the Phoenix Art Museum sculptural garden, and they even expanded this year to include two additional rooms indoors. The out-of-state wines were available for purchase, in addition to some sports and music memorabilia for auction (which seemed, out of place to me at a food event). Cocktails, entrees, appetizers, desserts, oh my. My husband and I even tried to split each portion so as not to get too full. Well, that only lasted so long. We were so pleased to see multiple fish dishes and beautiful salads available as we don't eat meat.  Green Restaurant is always a favorite and they showcased a mock-BBQ chicken with coleslaw salad. The cedar-planked salmon from Switch? I think, was also amazing. My favorite cocktails of the day were a fabulous dessert port from Su Vino Winery, and a pineapple/tequila shot from...I have no idea because I had two of them. There seemed to be plenty of water this year, I remember last year the bottled water ran out as it was a really hot day. There was also more seating this year, which was nice, so you could sit and digest a little. Terrific event!!!!!

I started going here as it's pretty close to home and convenient to get to in the Albertsons plaza on the corner of Scottsdale Rd and Thomas. I don't have much drycleaning to do. I might bring in one item a month, but everything I've brought in has been cleaned well. They seem to have a quick turnaround time too. I've never had any problems.

I've never stayed at Bally's but my first experience was a good one. The self park has you entering the Paris which is right next door and you can enter without going outside. Check in had us waiting about 30 min but since my husband and I were there with another couple, the hotel receptionist was able to place us in adjoining rooms so we weren't so far from each other.  We both got the standard tower room, double queen beds, but these rooms were BIG!! Nothing fancy, but it had an ottoman at the foot of each bed, extra chair, desk, armoire, table as well as your standard amenities like iron, ironing board, hairdryer, it even had a safe in the closet. It was clean and had plenty of towels and soap. Our floor was fairly quiet on the 10th floor and elevators were quick. My only complaint was the water temperature in the shower would flicker hot/cold in the evenings.  We only ate at one restaurant, the Ichiban, which was....meh, but their Thai restaurant looked good, should've tried that place. They also have a sports bar and food court downstairs.  Bally's has a monorail stop which is very convenient and although we did not partake, they offer shuttle service to the Rio.  I'm not sure why, but the electric walk-ways into the hotel weren't working all weekend. Normally I don't mind walking, but when you've got heels on you want all the electric walk-ways you can find.  Overall a fantastic location on the strip and good for the value.

This was my first year doing Pat's Run. What a great event! Considering the crowd that participates they did a pretty good job organizing things. There were plenty of opportunities to pick up your race packet the week prior. I really liked the women's v-neck tech t-shirt commemorating the event also. The route itself was fine although with so many people it wasn't wide enough at times. We had to cram through narrow areas and  a lot of us who run ended up a slow shuffle behind so many people. Finishing in the stadium was great and overall it's a fun event to support a great cause and remember a local hero. I'd definitely sign up again for next year!

Another great Pat's Run! One of the best t-shirts I've ever gotten from a run before too! Sold-out again this year but somehow it seemed a little more organized and let people know what to expect.  Three water stations along the route and water, bananas and oranges at the end. There were also some outside sponsors there handing out freebies-I did have a refreshing smoothie from jamba juice.  Cool finish line inside Sun Devil stadium, that's probably the best part. Along with being there with all those thousands of people for a great cause!

This casino brings a little bit of Vegas flare to the Phoenix area. Far different from other casinos in the valley, the Talking Stick is more hip, modern, and seems to cater to this type of crowd, but still pleases folks like my parents when they come to visit.  We recently took advantage of a couple friends who stayed  for a few nights. Their room was minimal-chic with crisp linens, dark wood furniture, and a beautiful spa-like bathroom. You can't just wander around the rooms if you don't have a reason to be there. A desk clerk asks for your room number or the name of the party you're visiting.  We took advantage of the pool party going on outside where the DJ provided the club music and staff were serving buckets of beers poolside. If you're not a guest at the resort I believe the pool party is regularly free for ladies and men pay a $10 cover.  There is a gorgeous restaurant here called Orange Sky, as well as a wine bar up the elevators. There is a dress code so since we weren't dressed for it we hit up the casual restaurant for lunch.  We don't gamble but the game floor was packed on this Sunday afternoon. They always seem to be hosting comedy shows and small concerts as well.  Great local resort for a Phoenix stay-cation!

I treated the husband for a birthday staycation this weekend. The staff was great from all angles. We got picked up in the parking lot by the golf cart driver to bring us to the lobby. The front desk had a seamless and simple check-in. The concierge was very helpful in answering my questions regarding transportation options into Old Town (I didn't want to worry about having some cocktails and driving back). Of note: their towncars will drop you off anywhere in Old Town for $21.  Their rooms are so pretty-I really love the simple, modern, sleek style. We didn't get to take advantage of the Release Pool Party this time around as it was raining, but it's free for hotel guests. Nice views of the desert too from our room.

First time here. We tried it on a Sunday so we couldn't take advantage of the Happy Hour deals but it looked like they off $2 beers.  The place has some indoor and outdoor seating as well. Kind of a surfer theme. You order and pay at the counter and take number with you. Your server brings your meals to your table but you get your own plastic silverware and napkins, etc. They had a couple vegetarian items on the menu. Nothing tasted bad, but I wasn't impressed. The ceviche and chips tasted good, but it was basically red onion, cucumber, and shrimp cocktail diced finely.  The best part was the red sauce it came with. The bean and cheese burrito was so gooey it oozed out of the tortilla making it very messy to eat. The veggie taco was onions, guacamole, and lettuce. When you looked inside it resembled grass clippings.  Like I said, nothing tasted bad, and I appreciate that they don't cook with lard, but I really wasn't impressed.

First of all the place smells fantastic. It made waiting for our desserts all the more difficult! Since we couldn't just get one thing (that would be wrong on so many levels) my party of three each ordered something and we sampled all. The Max Brenner pizza with "the works" was a marshmellowy delight-although the crust was way too thick-we ended up just scraping the topping off and eating that. The peanut butter and chocolate sundae was heavenly (our favorite) and the third was the chocolate cake with chocolate ganache inside served with ice cream and a chocolate "shot". We had lots of left-overs which made for tasty late night snacks.   The fondue was another popular favorite ordered by many of the tables around us. I'd be curious to try the regular menu also, but I don't think I could go there and NOT get dessert. Truly indulgent.  The staff was friendly but tried to clear our plates too quickly! You know you can lose a couple fingers that way if you're not careful. It would have been nice not to have felt rushed.

I happen to buy a groupon for this place because I needed new running shoes a few  months ago. The sales associate was super helpful. Asking me what I usually buy, which brand I tend to like. She told me how to get the best fit and I was able to go outside the store and run/walk around. I love this! How else do you test running shoes if you just stand there???  She also taught me how to tie them correctly which I had no idea I'd been doing it wrong (it involves that extra lacing hole on the top that you think is too far up as it is).   I bought myself a pair of Brooks and have been happy with them ever since. Although I haven't participted in any, they do offer free group runs also on a weekly basis.

Haven't been here since it used to be the old Mickeys'. The old firetruck inside is super cool! Good layout, patios are always nice and good idea to have the two bars inside. We caught the end of an MMA fight and then stayed to have a few beers. The music the DJ was playing was great! I think the three of us would've busted a move....if we weren't the only ones who looked like we wanted to.....

We were celebrating my husbands birthday, so after dinner in Old Town we stopped over here for drinks around 9:30 on Saturday night. It was still quiet and they had sports playing on the large tvs. Our group of 7 got a great spot on one of the couches where we sat and relaxed and ordered drinks.  Around 10 they started playing music, and I've always thought they play really good stuff here.   About 10:30 we were asked to give up our spot, for potential bottle service customers. I feel if you arrive early enough to grab a couch, and you're actively ordering drinks and being a good customer, you shouldn't be asked to move.  I realize bottle service is a money maker for the bar, but it sent the message that "their money is better than your money". It left the 7 of us standing around, so we decided to take our celebration and money elsewhere.

Last weekend I subjected a couple friends of mine to a bikram class at the studio I frequent, so in turn I tried a yoga class at their studio, Life Power Yoga. I was surprised to see that this is more than just a yoga studio. After signing in for a free first-timers class, my friend gave me the general tour. This place is really beautiful. Cardio equipment, free wtgs, kettlebells, nautilus, etc. The women's locker room has key-card lockers so you don't have to bring your own padlock. Shower towels, hairdryer, q-tips, plenty of showers and it was clean.  The yoga studio is a beautiful hard wood floor room. Adjustable lighting, music, and temperature allowed the instructor to set the tone he wanted for the room. Class was 75 min. A word of caution-if you're a newbie, there is no instruction. I found it difficult to hear the instructor over the music, and since each yogi is doing their own variation of the postures based on their skill level I was lost as to who to look at. Perhaps after a few more times I'd get the hang of it.

The concept of a seasonal menu is great, especially at Seasons 52 where they have a weekly seasonal specials menu that changes each week, hence the 52 in the name. Also each menu item is suppose to be portion-size appropriate and 475 cal or less. Sure butter and olive oil make food taste good, but it's nice to eat this and know that healthy meals can be made incredible tasty without the added cooking fat.   We started by sharing the goat cheese ravioli appetizer and a salad with arugula, roasted beets and almonds.  Their drink menu is pretty impressive too with many wine and beer options and mixed cocktails.   For our main entrees I got the scallops and my man got the trout. Both were delicious. We finished the meal with a sampling of their mini indulgences desserts, which are served in a shot glass. P.F. Chang's does this too and it's a nice idea. You get a little something sweet but it's not this huge heavy dessert at the end.   Our server Stephanie was very nice. She also took the white bean soup off our bill without any problems when we realized upon arrival to our table that it was cooked with ham (which we don't eat and it wasn't mentioned on the menu).   Nice decor inside too, slightly rustic-contemporary and a nice open floor plan. Oh, and they validate parking too, since you have to pay in the lot out front.  Thanks!

So glad to have a DSW closer to me than the one in Chandler. This store is beautiful and they have a great selection. It's organized really well and it was nice to see sales staff actually out on the floor straightening up. They have a great clearance section too with lots of shoes discounted. I went in today with the goal to buy one pair......left with three.

Only left with one pair today, man I must be slackin'.  The store was very neat and tidy today, with associates keeping things in order. Well stocked with different sizes and tons of stuff on sale. Two registers open, the line moved quickly. I cannot recall the last time I bought a pair of shoes somewhere else, it seems I always go to DSW!

Not only is this still a great store, this location is my favorite. I was recently in Chandler and stopped at the DSW behind fashion square. Many of the styles I liked were out of my size and I wasn't wowed by too much. Last night I checked out this store to see if they had more sizes in stock, and not only did they have more of my size but more inventory and a few different styles I hadn't seen in Chandler. Yay shoes!!

We went during the week and we were the only customers in the place. The service was great-I'll say that right off the bat. Not that the staff had anything better to do, as we were their only customers, but the guy who turned out to be our waiter held the door for us as we entered and left. He refilled our water numerous times, and was prompt with our food.   The food was ok. I ordered pad thai ( I know it's a thai staple but I always really like it, and what better for a test of good thai?) and my man ordered a different noodle dish with the flat, rice noodles. The price was average. I liked my mans' dish better than mine, somehow the pad thai tasted a little....weird. Couldn't put my finger on it.   The decor looked like a converted fast food joint. You know how McDonalds or Wendy's will have that glass-enclosed area in the front with the sloped glass ceiling overhead? Well, that was there. So it kind of reminded me of such a place.   Yah, just wasn't enough to make me want to come back, but I'll still give them props for good service.

I've done consignment at a few different places around the valley. It's interesting how some take more of  your items than others. I brought a bunch of items into this Plato's Closet today, this was my first time in here.  While waiting for them to take a look at my stuff, I was looking at their stuff. I found all their styles to be really....young, kind of overly worn (many items I looked at had stains), and frumpy. I tend to like more classic pieces, vintage, rather than fleeting and trendy. Needless to say, I didn't see anything I wanted to buy, and coincidentally they didn't take any of my items. Funny though the reason. I was told that they were passing on my whole bag of stuff because the styles were a little older and too "fancy" for what they are selling.

H&M can be a hit or miss store with me, but nonetheless if you do find something you like its usually at a good price. Especially their accessories. You can afford to buy a few pieces to change or update an outfit without blowing the bank.    I was recently in Vegas and visited this newly opened H&M in the Forum Shops. We had been to the one at Miracle Mile the day before and were disappointed it was so small. This one is an experience for sure. Like everything Vegas it was big, loud, and glitzy. Multiple levels, a DJ booth, lights, and a huge selection of clothing. My friend found a dress to wear out that night for $40 and I bought an $8 pair of sunglasses. Not bad at all.

After attending the yelp event at Tanzy, we were so lucky to have gotten these free passes to try out the iPic Theaters. The theater itself is so nice and clean. We reserved seats online, but once we arrived the woman at the ticket counter offered some suggestions for different seats we might enjoy, which were still available.  The premium seating seats are super comfortable lounge-style and come with a pillow and blanket! I was in heaven already. We ordered a couple cocktails, which were not cheap by any means at about $10-$12, but were a good size and really delicious. The sweet potato fries were probably the best I've ever had, ever!!! We also enjoyed some popcorn which comes with the premium seating as well.  This was so fabulous, I'm officially spoiled!

What a gorgeous place to sit and have a cocktail. The Chandelier bar is a girly-girls dream. I agree with Kelly G, if you like sparkles, you'll love it here!  Our first round we ordered traditional from the bar. Prices are what you'd expect. When a lounge couch opened up we had a seat and noticed their cocktail menu. They offer a very interesting assortment of drinks. You can tell a mixologist concocted these because many of them looked complicated and had ingredients we had never heard of. I don't even remember what they were called or what was in them, but they were gooooood. Had to ask our waitress a few questions to decipher what might taste good, but she was very nice and able to help us decide.  Not only did we have cool drinks and get to gaze upon this sparkly architectural beauty (do they renovate closets?) but we also got to listen to an amazing retro band where the singer crooned old tunes from the 20's.  I think I've found my new favorite Vegas bar!

Since I had such a great time at the Chandelier Bar during my last trip to Vegas we made it a return spot this time. Friday and Saturday night still gather a crowd for the house band and you can usually grab a seat if they are between sets. While they are playing it gets super busy and you might have to end up standing. The cocktails are around $14 and really interesting flavors. My new favorite was their version of a mai tai with strawberry puree. It was delicious. Our Friday night experience was really fun. Saturday night was busier, and too smokey-we had to leave. The first floor of the bar is my favorite. We tried going upstairs but the vibe is different. It's kind of boring upstairs.....so stop by the ground floor.

Brought my sister for her first trip to Vegas this weekend. I wanted to try a place I had never been and after finding out about Estiatorio Milos, I made reservations for dinner. Growing up in the Greek culture, it's hard to find those flavors you remember unless:  a.) mom makes it  b.) you go back to Greece  As far as we were concerned, we could've been dining by the water at our old Paralia Katerinoskala beach enjoying some mezethes.....it was delicious.  They didn't serve traditional retsina wine, which is kind of an acquired taste, and not very high end-which is probably why. However their sommelier helped us decide on a few glasses of Greek wines and brought over a couple to try before ordering. Our waiter helped tweak the menu a bit so we could order 4 different appetizers as our dinner. He wanted to course them, but in Greece you order a bunch and have them out all at once so you can take a bite here and there. He was able to do that for us.   We got the milos special which is fried zucchini and eggplant served with tzatziki, the grilled octopus, horiatiki salad, and htipiti. Octopus is difficult to get right, and unfortunately, many restaurants get it wrong. It's difficult to cook yourself too so I don't make a habit of it. Milos did an amazing job. Tender and flavorful, not dry and overcooked. Awesome. The htipiti was a welcome memory as it's only served regionally in Greece and seems we could get it in the northern region but ask for it in Athens and they look at you funny.   Service was spot on, of course. Everyone was friendly, polite, professional. Our waiter George checked on us often and brought us two glasses of mastiha at the end of the evening. Yamas!! A wonderful experience!!!!

This restaurant in the Scottsdale Quarter is located up on the second floor. It was bigger than I expected with a nice open atmosphere. We were in a private dining room in the back for the Yelp event and had the most amazing experience. The staff was welcoming and friendly and kept the food and drinks coming!  Some of my favorite dishes of the evening included the artisan ricotta-stuffed mozzarella cheese, the calamari, scallops, tempura brussel sprouts, and red velvet bread pudding. The wines were delicious and we also got to sample a couple cocktails which looked as beautiful as they tasted!  This would be a great place to bring my parents when they visit from out of town, or to celebrate a special occasion. Wonderful experience!!!

Finally tried this place with friends from out of town. We went on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and waited about 20 min for a table. The menu looks amazing! Wonderful sandwiches and salads, as we waited and eyeballed the food coming out to other tables we were immediately impressed. I went with the veggie hummus pita wrap which came with super crispy sweet potato chips. My husband opted for the sweet potato tacos that I kept staring at. Our friends also ordered the sweet potato tacos and and the steak tacos.  We each thoroughly enjoyed our meals and with all plates cleaned we ordered a round of coffee and tea to finish the meal.  Everything was deliciously fresh, good flavors. The decor is simple and clean and my friend commented that she felt like she was at a Virginia beach house. They passed the water glass test too-always a bonus. Great place!!!

Wow, this place doesn't disappoint! We arrived on a Thursday night around 7pm. The hostess went to check for us if there were any outside tables available, and during the 60 seconds maybe that she was gone, 3 servers passing by asked us if we needed help. Talk about GREAT customer service! I LOVE IT!! This time around I wasn't super hungry, so I ordered the garden salad and a side of roasted beets. The salad was bigger than I expected for a "side" salad and was plenty for me along with the beets. My husband ordered the gorgonzola and pear flatbread which was also topped with a crispy sage that lent a great little crunch to it. My brother-in-law ordered the ribs which he said were really tasty-they also came with a side of their mac & cheese which is wonderfully rich and decadent.  Our server was friendly and had a great attitude. Our water glasses were filled promptly once again and we left as happy campers. This place is a class act.

Another year, another Resolution Run 5k! This run is a nice way to start off the new year. It's quick, it's close, and the Running Masters who put it together always have such a fun attitude!  For a $25 registration fee, you get a long-sleeve chromatic t-shirt which changes color in the sun. The race is sponsored by Sweet Tomatoes and this year was also sponsored by Cliff Bar-both of which provided snacks after the run.  There are medals awarded to the top three finishers in each age category and a raffle for various prizes such as water bottles, sports bags, and gift certificates to Sole Sports and Sweet Tomatoes.  The run meets in Papago park and the course takes you onto the canal just south of McDowell Rd. Starts at 9am so it's not too early either.

The reviews were really mixed, so I was a little apprehensive, although still wanted to try the place. My friend and I went for lunch on a Sunday afternoon so it was really empty. Since remarks were made about the decor, we decided ahead of time to get our order to-go. The decor was pretty bare, but it everything looked new and clean, so that works for me in a super casual place such as this.  We were immediately greeted by the counter cashier who had been sitting and talking with some friends at one of the front tables. She asked if we had been there before, and since we hadn't, she ran through the menu and some of their highlights. Ok, so the service was better than I expected too.  I ordered the portobello/hallume pita and yam chips (on the recommendation of a couple reviewers-thanks!). My friend also ordered the chips and a falafel pita. I think I paid $10 for the sandwich and chips.  Ok, it was salty.....but delicious. We both really enjoyed our sandwiches and the yam chips were super crunchy. I'm curious next time to try their homemade tofu.  I also plan on riding my bike next time as they offer 20% off when you show up on your bike!

This was my first time here so I have nothing else to compare it too if it was an average night or not. For those of us who ran the Las Vegas Rock n Roll marathon and half marathons this year this was the sight of one of our "pre-parties" on Saturday night. Runners got free entry and free vodka wells from 10-12:30, but it wasn't exclusively a runners-only night. There was a huge line which we waited in for about an hour, but once inside we were able to get at least two drinks within the time remaining.  The dance floor is small and the club is a long narrow room. VIP lines the walls and there is a bar on either end. For those of us regular people who don't VIP we danced all night. The DJ was great and he mixed a little bit of everything: old school hip hop, top 40, techno, and kept it moving so he wasn't stuck on one song for too long.  They shot out confetti over the crowd a few times, and tossed out these light up wands for those of us on the dance floor.  The bathroom didn't have a line when I went in, and since there was an attendant it was kept clean.  Dress code is a must at a Vegas club though. There was a young guy in line behind us who showed up in swim shorts, sneakers, and his runners t-shirt. Bouncer told him to go home and "dress up". So bring your swag people.

This was our first time here and we went on a Friday evening. It's small and they don't take reservations so just keep that in mind. We lucked out to arrive at a good time and didn't have to wait. There was about two minutes left of happy hour and our server was nice enough to grab us a couple spring rolls and drinks right away!  The decor is cool and simple, although our white bar-like chairs were kind of ratty. The vinyl was tore and old. The two unisex bathrooms don't have a sink inside, it's right outside so you have to leave the bathroom to wash your hands and perform any mirror primping. So much for checking if you have food in your teeth in private!  Aside from that the food and service were so good. The waitstaff was attentive and prompt. They were always around if we needed something. The food was AWESOME!! They have so many varieties of spring rolls, we LOVED them! I also ordered the Saigon/Bun salad with tofu. It was really big but I still ate 95% of it because I just couldn't stop eating it! Our server even brought some extra dressing for me without me having to ask.   Great experience all around!!

Another restaurant week night out! Decor in Province was so beautiful. Simple, clean lines, one bold pink accent wall that matched the sofa that lines the opposing wall. It was beautiful. The natural accents of driftwood and moss also lend to a feeling of freshness and health and clean eating.  The "bread" basket was a nice small sample-if I'm given a huge basket I have a hard time not eating it, so this was preferred. We opted for the $10pp wine pairing to accompany the meal, which was a nice option.   The meal started with a lovely tomato gazpacho amuse. Between the two of us my husband and I ordered the heirloom tomato and mozz salad, the goat cheese fondue, the organic salmon, the goat cheese tortellini, and of course the trio of desserts which included the peach tart, squash cupcake and chocolate peanut butter flan.  Everything was flavorful, cooked perfectly, and presented beautifully.   Service was friendly, attentive, and prompt. They passed the water glass test and timing of courses had a good flow.   We left there with a coupon for $20 off $40. I certainly don't need my arm twisted to come back!

Found this store in a local Phoenix guide my visiting-from-out-of-town sister picked up. What a cute place! It's multipldee shops on one corner and each one has a different theme. There are sections for kids, pets, home, "country" type stuff, fun and girly stuff, etc.   Some of it is a little pricey, especially the home decor section. If you're looking for gift ideas though, they have something for everyone. I actually returned the next day and purchased a cupcake birthday headband as a gift for an upcoming birthday girl.   The sales staff were all very nice too, and seemed to really enjoy working there. Check them out, you're sure to find something for any gift situation!

We got an online coupon to try this place and went on a Sunday around 7pm for dinner. The decor is very cool-neat floral booths with plastic overlay, beer taps at the booths, amazing mural on the far right wall.  We both enjoyed our margaritas, which for the size were fair on the $8 price tag.  The food was tasty, but not original. We ordered the ceviche app (which we liked the best), the mushroom tacos and the house salad with shrimp. Although our waitress came back and informed us that they were out of shrimp so we opted to try it without as there aren't too many non-meat or fish options on the menu. The smashed plantains and pumpkin seeds were a nice touch in the salad, but it was lacking something special.  I can see coming here for happy hour or for a fri/sat night drink. They had a DJ booth which was cool, but (and I may sound old for saying this) it was just too loud for a Sunday night dinner.

I had heard great things about Spinato's pizza and last night we ordered takeout from this one. In order to please the pallate of the three of us whom were consuming, the person on the phone suggested the sweet pepper and onion pizza. They told us it would be 45 min for delivery.... The guy arrived in about 40 min and it was well worth it. The pizza was delicious! Cut into squares, which I like that some places do this, it had a nice thin crust, plenty of cheese and sauce, and was also sprinkled with oregano in addition to the toppings. We were all thoroughly impressed!  Today at work I overheard some colleagues planning on ordering the spinach pizza, which sounded wonderful. Will have to go for that one next.

I had been to a breakfast place here before called Le Peep, now as Butters Cafe I like the decor and the menu a lot better. They have indoor and outdoor seating and a great looking menu. I was stuck on three items and couldn't decide! I opted for the brioche french toast with bananas while my husband got the other item I wanted to try, the Eggs Verde. Both were delicious. Although I'm a sugar girl and brioche just sets my heart a flutter at the thought, his eggs verde with black beans and cheese was awesome. Not to mention the cheese grits that accompanied his meal. I've never had grits taste so....decadent! Our friends both go the Mexican breakfast burrito with the largest hashbrown I've ever seen!  The coffee was delicious and filled frequently. They left a water pitcher on the table, as well as a huge bottle of syrup. I can't stand that little syrup serving some places give you because you always run out....and there you're left....alone with your dry french toast....but not here! :) Great friendly service and very on top of cleaning up the table and checking on us!!

Cool concept for a bar/club in Old Town Scottsdale. The Spanish Fly has a pool surrounded by a couple bars and cabanas. We ended our San Tan Brews Cruise here, so I haven't been on a regular night. It's really pretty, good music, and I believe they're open during the day as well for lounging and day drinking. It seems to cater to a younger "see and be seen" crowd if that's your flavor.

I bought a Groupon, like other reviewers did, and had an equally difficult time getting an appointment and communicating with Seth (the owner and massage therapist). I never actually spoke to him on the phone, only by answering machine, so booking the appointment was very frustrating and getting a date took about three months. He said he'd sold Groupons before and this happened.... so wouldn't you figure he'd plan a different strategy this time to manage all the influx of clients?   The spa is a small clinic-type building where Seth has a room and other massage therapists have other rooms (and other business names) that share a waiting area.  The massage itself was pretty good. I requested deep pressure, and he did a good job of maintaining that while "checking in" with me twice to ask if the pressure was ok. I've never had my stomach massaged before though. It has never come up in all the massages I've ever had, but he went ahead and did it here without asking me. I didn't  care for it either.....because so much pressure on your abdomen stimulates your digestion and puts pressure on your organs that I didn't care for. I'll leave my digestion to other professionals, thank you.  So at the end of the massage I got up from the table and my neck felt great-especially since the week before I had had a killer tension headache. The only problem, is Seth completely killed my "massage buzz" by cornering me to purchase a two for $90 deal. Excuse me? I just got up from the table and you're pressuring me to buy this now? It was awkward awkward awkward. This is why I don't go to Massage Envy!!! It would have been more appropriate had he offered this deal and said it was valid for 30days or even better if he emailed me the offer. Instead he said I'd need to pay for it now. No thank you. I didn't appreciate his sales pitch, it was not the appropriate time and made for a weird moment when I was supposed to be enjoying being relaxed.

Great haunted house! Probably the most creative one I've ever been to. It just kept going and going and each room was a completely different theme than demonstrated a lot of work went into it.  In reading some of the other reviews, I think what people forget to realize about haunted houses is that the staff is limited to what they can do "to" you in order to scare you. They cannot touch you. They cannot trap you or hold you somewhere, or block your desire to exit. They cannot throw anything, spill anything, or drip anything on you. So you have to rely pretty much on being scared through what you can see, hear, or maybe feel in terms of temperature or, in the case here, a few bursts of air on you.  Not only was the 13 Floors really creative, but so was their zombieland counterpart. The minute I walked in, it felt like being in a town overtaken by zombies-and the honking car was especially cool!  The actors inside did a great job. I can't imagine screaming and yelling all night to scare patrons!

I agree with some of the gripes written by other yelpers. We went to see Bob Saget last night and it was our first time visiting Stand Up Live.  The website mentions that parking is free for the first three hours with validation, and $2/hr after that....but doesn't really elaborate where. We had to make a second loop around the block to find the "hidden" parking garage entrance on 1st Ave. Problem is this is VERY LIMITED PARKING. We made three loops inside looking for spaces. Tip: bring your small car!! Spaces are tiny! Once inside my husband and I were seated in the middle row shoulder to shoulder with other couples, which wasn't so bad as we were next to nice people, but it makes it difficult to get out. Our server was back and forth to the table often, but we did have one drink error which she promptly fixed, and our food went to another table by mistake. So we waited an hour to eat. The comedy was good, acoustics, bathrooms, all good so no complaints there. Good opening act for Bob Saget.  Our bill was $54 for one veggie burger, two san tan ales, and two vodka rocks. Oh, and if you order vodka on the rocks your bill will say $8 for the vodka, and $2 for the rocks. NO KIDDING. We even asked our server about it. They in fact CHARGED US EXTRA FOR THE ICE IN MY DRINK.  No customer finds these unnecessary and frivolous charges fair. It left me with a very negative feeling at the end of the evening.

There's something to be said about performing stunts at your own risk and getting completely filthy from head to toe. It's just fun. This 3 mi course had a bunch of obstacles along the way such as the rope ladder, balance beam, wall climb, stomping over crushed cars, the mud pit of course, and a few others. My favorite aside from the mud pit was the jumping over the fire pit. When does this opportunity arise? Unless one is super drunk while camping....but somehow then it sounds stupid....but I digress..... We dressed up in costumes and it was fun to see a few other teams do the same. I liked the t-shirt, and viking hat that came with the entrance fee, along with the finishers medal. What I didn't like was paying $10/car to park (complete B.S.), not being allowed to bring any of our own food/drink to the event. Since the awards ceremony was scheduled after the last leg we would have had to stay all day since we ran at 10am. At their prices for beer and food there's no way we could've stuck around for 6-7hours, which is too bad because I think we had a god shot! Next year: no parking fee please, and lets do the costume contest beforehand!

I had no idea that there are so many rental options on Tempe Town Lake! Kayaks, large pontoon style boats, floating bicycles, jet skis, etc. Today was our first time trying a rental and we were curious about the stand up paddle boarding. Apparently you can reserve online, which I'd probably recommend as it was way more popular than we expected. We had to wait about an hour as it's first come first serve. Price is $20pp per hour. After a quick lesson we were well on our way. It's surprisingly easy and super fun-highly recommended! Staff was very friendly and helpful.

We've had a coupon for this place for a while and finally ordered a pizza from them. Coupon was for $11.99 large unlimited topping, but the guy on the phone kept quoting a higher price. It took a little clarification on my husbands part for the guy to understand that when your coupon says $11.99 then that's what you get your pizza for.  So we ordered  a veggie pizza with extra cheese, minus olives and mushrooms as our friend was allergic. It was tasty, but not extraordinary. The only veggies I could visually see were green peppers, onions, and garlic. The crust was also a bit too thick and chewy, whereas I prefer a thinner crust with crispy edges. Not bad, but nothing amazing.

Decided to try the vegetarian pizza for $19.95, but since our parents taught us well to clip coupons we had $5 off (thanks mom and dad). The pizza arrived to our outside patio table, practically busting off the pan. Wicked bigger than a typical large pizza and had at least 6 veggie toppings on it. DELICIOUS!!!! Slices are large, and too big to pick up and eat-this is a utensil pizza.  I was actually full after one slice but had two because it was so tasty. Looking at their menu they also appear to have some tasty-sounding salads and desserts.  I loooooove me some pizza, and we're always looking for a new tasty place to add to the repertoire.

Since our first experience we've ordered take out from Pizza Re many times. We always seem to have a $5 off coupon from the local mailer or from Yelp Check-in so you can't go wrong. Their large pizza still dazzles for the value and size you get. We always get a veggie pizza and it seems to be a little different each time-but that's kind of nice.  Last night we actually had to wait an hour for pick up, as it was unusually busy. However it that means this place is popular and will stick around, that's ok. I'd like to see them here a long time!

I was looking for a nail salon to treat my sister and I to spa pedicures, so I looked no further than yelp! Pro Nails by Julie came up with excellent reviews and it was convenient that we didn't need an appointment.  The reviews were spot on! This is probably the cleanest nail salon I've been to. I noticed that they used separately packaged tool kits for each client!  We chose the Deluxe Spa Pedicure for $33 which included all the pedicure basics plus sugar scrub, heel lotion and a massage. The scrub and massage were so relaxing and my nail tech did a great job on my cuticles and polish. My sisters toes left with a beautiful coral/gold sheen.  I also like that they accept credit cards and you can tip on your card. Super convenient but surprisingly a lot of salons don't do this.  Great experience! I can't imagine going anywhere else!

Enjoyed our first visit to Limelight for AZ Restaurant week. The decor is dark and modern, with green lighting accents to match the name. I just don't understand the multiple tv's with all the sports broadcasting?! Please pick a theme-do you want to be a hip, modern-feel hangout or do you want to be a sports bar? It didn't gel.  Our cocktails were very good, we tried two of the martinis. The first courses were generous portions and my husband and I finished them despite knowing we had two more courses to come. The lobster cake was crispy with a lovely beurre blanc. My husbands' ahi tuna had a wonderful sear and accompanying balsamic glaze. Second course was a beet and endive salad with coconut-shrimp "dipping sticks" , which are really like kebabs. My husband ordered the ahi tuna melt. Dessert was a red velvet cheesecake with "frosting" dipping sauce and candied walnuts and my husband ordered the strawberry creme brulee. We took home half of our entrees and part of our desserts as we just couldn't finish everything. Good portion size, the timing of the food was good through the courses and the staff seemed very attentive in asking if everything was ok. On that note, my husband and I are such sticklers for the water-glass test. We really appreciate a full water glass and it tends to accompany good service if your water glass is maintained. I did have to ask for it here, but only once. Since our server was around frequently I didn't deduct a star for that. Am I softening?

I am a big fan of Green Restaurant and frequent their other location pretty often. Since we were in the area last night, and I was jonesin' for some Green, we decided to try their newer location on 7th st.  Parking is limited so we were lucky to have found a spot. The restaurant is smaller than their other location, but I still really liked the decor. It's simple and uncluttered. I noticed a few new menu items but since I'm a diehard fan of the diablo I went with that again. My husband ordered a "steak and cheese" with chili fries. He also opted for the tahini coleslaw on the side.  I of course inhaled my food. As always, the thought occurs to me to save half of it for tomorrow but then it's so good I can't......stop......eating...... My husband really enjoyed his fries and sandwich, and the tahini coleslaw was a nice refreshing change from traditional overly-mayonnaised coleslaw.  I left with a full belly and a smile.

Met some friends for dinner Sat night. It was totally empty in here for a Saturday evening but the friends we dined with have eaten here before and had good things to say.  I ordered a glass of wine and my husband tried a spicy jalapeno margarita mixed drink. Not bad. The chips and salsa they bring to the table include three salsas (one is a more a traditional salsa, one is a bean dip, and the other more of a creamy verde sauce). Our server told us the fish tacos appetizer was excellent so we ordered those. I ordered the shrimp diablo and my husband ordered the seafood stew in a creamy sauce.  The fish tacos were just ok. They weren't "excellent", I've had far better fish tacos, although I did like the mango-jalapeno salsa that came on the side. My entree was VERY spicy, fitting with the name and came with black beans and I decided to try the lemon-cilantro rice which was pretty good. I don't think it was worth $24 though. Highly overpriced for such a simple meal of a few shrimp with rice and beans.   My husbands meal tasted good, but he said it was more reminiscent of Italian flavors, and nothing really Mexican about it other than his sides of black beans and Spanish rice. One of our friends ordered a pasta dish with a cream sauce he loved previously, and was disappointed when it came out with spaghetti style pasta vs the linguine he'd had before.  Although our server was friendly, she was scarce. We waited and waited, even for our drinks. After she took our drink order she apologized for the wait as she said the bartender was MIA all of a sudden.  Even our friends who had better experiences here said this evening was lackluster at best. I just think it was also overpriced for what it was.  As a side note, I was expecting a huge tequila menu and was excited to try a few, but their drink menu just included wines and specialty mixed drinks. I'm sure they have tequila at the bar, but I guess I was expecting it to be featured more.

Stopped in here around 6:30 on Saturday night after our movie got out. We asked to be seated outside and got a table quickly, although then we wished we had an umbrella because the misters were drenching everything. The host saw us scooting the table over to avoid the deluge and was nice about offering to help us out.  After waiting for what seemed like way too long for some acknowledgement from our server, another server came by and offered to get us started with drinks. Our real server showed up later and introduced herself, brought us water and then scooted away! Even though we had been looking at the menu a good 15 minutes and were ready to order. So we waited.....and waited.......and waited. In this time I grew very impatient and realized that I had a whole wine rack at home and a fridge full of food.  We were deciding to eat out for the ambiance and experience and so far this experience was not worth my time or money. When she finally returned I had mentally checked out and told her we weren't hungry. She left our table as if she really didn't care anyway, and that first server, who wasn't ours came by to check on us and we said we'd take the check.  Never been here before. Awful first impression.

This is a cool place! It reminds me of an eatery that should be located up in Maine. Kind of a lodge feel, lots of wood, simple.  I skipped the drinks this go 'round and went straight to stuffing my face. Our table split the green chili dip with chips and pita. It was warm, and gooey and disappeared quickly! My margarita pizza was loaded with cheesy-garlicky goodness, although could've used a few more tomatoes. I really enjoyed my husbands mahi fish and chips apparently because after taking half of one to try, I went back for the second half! Our friends ordered the fish tacos and veggie/hummus flatbread which were devoured as well. We finally split the apple pie at the end and then pulled out our pillows for naps tableside...... My only gripe was I was jonesing for water and never had my glass refilled. Otherwise our server was friendly and fairly prompt.

This time I brought my dog and we sat on the patio. The staff was so great about making sure she had water and dog treats. It's so nice to bring your dog to a place and have her feel welcomed!!!  The umbrellas were up and misters were on-bring on summer!! Service overall was very friendly and we were even offered water cups to go as it was so hot out today! Thanks!! As usual, food was delicious as was the beer. I enjoyed the beet salad with Mammas little yellow pils, and my sister got the grilled cheese and grapefruit wheat. This place has definitely become one of my favorites.

CPR re-certification is just something you have to do as a healthcare professional.  We all moan and groan about it because there are a hundred other things you'd rather be doing for 3hrs.  However, I've been going to Heart Savers for quite a few years now and they have managed to streamline their system pretty well. When you call to make your appointment you have to be pretty specific on which re-cert you need. I was one of three professionals in my class and only the three of us needed to demonstrate the two-man CPR at then end of class. There were a few taking first aide, who stayed later, so the class was a mix.  The instructor Moira had a great attitude, and kept the class moving along pretty well. She followed two handouts that were passed out on infant/child/adult CPR outlining technique as well as laws involved and our responsibilities if we as bystanders opt to perform CPR on a victim. She also covered choking in each age category.  The hands-on skills portion went very quickly with three teams rotating to perform skills on the infant, child, and adult mannequins. A second instructor was brought in to help the class run quickly. I don't recall his name but he was equally as good and had a good sense of humor.  Each student has their own mannequin but the skills are performed as a group in unison so it's much faster than classes I've been to in the past where each person has to sit around and watch everyone individually. Those of us in the professionals course took a written multiple choice quiz at the end (we were allowed to work on it throughout the class), and after three hours we're all set for the next two years! One note I'll mention is that pricing appears to vary greatly. I don't understand how they price it at all as each person seemed to pay differently. I was quoted at $35 over the phone, so that's what I paid, and I think that's fair.  But I heard cheaper rates being quoted in class, as well as higher ones (you pay once you get to class).

I had been to the restaurant here when it was the Mondrian....then for a brief period it became the Theodore hotel....now as The Saguaro it's new restaurant space is called Distrito. We rolled up here on a bike crawl last night-which was a surprise because usually this type of swanky establishment does not cater to our booze cruisin' crew.  I was immediately impressed by the very cool (and colorful! the stark white is gone!) decor complete with gold sparkly tables, dia de los muertos skulls, and pop art style wall paintings. There was a different feel to the place too. No longer did you get the sense the staff was giving you the stare-down. It seemed younger, hipper, more fun and whimsical rather than upscale pretentiousness.  We enjoyed some cocktails but the food seems like it's getting some great reviews! Definitely worth a try, it will change your mind.

This restaurant has multiple seating options: bar seating in the center of the room with tv's nestled above, mafioso booths on the right-hand side, tables on the left, as well as outdoor seating under a shaded pergola. It was scarcely occupied today but on Easter that could be a hit or miss. We opted for a booth and I was pleasantly surprised that this decor was slightly country....but not down-home Southern country. It had that "farm" element to it, but not more like farm-chic, or as my husband called it  "neuvo-farmish". It's clearly a design term..... I ordered an iced tea which was filled repeatedly, along with our waters. In fact, when my husbands water no longer had ice in it we were brought a glass of ice. Damn, they're good. We both ordered fish sandwiches. His: the blackened fish sandwich with remoulade, red onion, butter lettuce on an artisan bun. Mine: rare ahi tuna with siracha mayo with the same bun an accoutrements. I love that you can order a different side off their "farm" menu rather than just getting fries. I opted for the jumbo roasted asparagus which put me at awe first at their gorgeous appearance, and secondly, their crispy-juicy texture. My husbands jalapeno-cheddar grits were quite tasty as well. No really spicy, which would have been nice, but had a great flavor with the jalapenos. I thought both sandwiches were good, although my piece of tuna was an odd cut and a little too soft. I like when ahi has that great fresh-firmness to it and when they cut it so you don't have to navigate around a piece of fascia...cause' that's no fun.  If I wasn't so full I would've made my husband split the key lime pie, which I'm always a sucker for. Perhaps next time. I haven't been impressed with a new place in a while, and this one won me over. Thank you!!

The Trans-Siberian Orchestra rolled into Glendale for their winter tour 2011 and I haven't seen that much hair flipping since the mid 1980's. Most of us are familiar with their rock renditions of Christmas songs, but I didn't know anything about the band. For one, they actually sing! There's singing, dancing, music, lights, lasers, pyrotechnics, moving stage equipment, etc. My husband and I had to laugh a little about the 80's factor though. Everyone seems to have long hair both men and women, which they repeatedly whip back and forth while shredding on a white inverted V guitar, or a purple sparkled violin. There were also a lot of rock fists in the air and side to side choreographed swaying "for emphasis".  Kind of like if Poison or Skid Row did a Christmas show....but we loved it. The music is amazing and moving, and the show was "narrated" by a gentleman who sort of told a story of Christmas in between the musical performances. The lasers and lights and pyrotechnics were, of course, the highlights and I found myself with oooohhs and aaaahhs. Purely awesome.

A friend of mine has her hair done here and loves the place. I was looking to get a retro-pinup style done and her stylist recommended Girard who works in the salon. He called me back shortly after I left him a voicemail and was able to book an appointment for me on the specific day I needed. Since we had never met,  I loved that he asked me specific questions about my hair type, what kind of style I was looking for, even to text him a photo of what I was going to be wearing. I was immediately impressed. The salon is gorgeous. A very cool downtown loft where the owners live upstairs and the salon is on the first floor. Cool art hangs of the concrete walls and a teal couch serves as the waiting and stylist-consult area.  We looked online for some examples and Girard went to work. Not only did he give me a beautiful style, but he managed to make my otherwise fine, hard-to-hold-a-curl-hair, stay put all night!! That's pure hair engineering if I ever saw it! Great experience! Thank you!!

I agree with all the other reviewers so far. This festival was one of the most poorly planned events I have ever been to. It all started when I purchased 2 tickets via groupon for $10. Arriving at the event I waited about 30 min to park my car which cost me another $5.   Once I entered the festival the lines for each truck were awful. Not only that, you couldn't see the menus very well to see what each truck was serving. Not all of them are blatantly marked. The first line we stood in ran out of food. The next two lines we attempted didn't move....at all. I'm serious. I don't know what was going on up in those food trucks, but I wasn't getting any closer to eating the longer I waited. Also, can I mention that you still have to pay for the food. Oh yes, you pay to enter this event, and then pay to eat.   After 90 minutes of waiting in lines and not eating I was hungry, frustrated, irritated, thirsty, and down right pissed off. We left. I therefore spent $15 for a boat-load of aggravation and ate no food at this food festival. What a complete waste of time.

After a recent trip to Thailand (where we indulged in many $6 massages), my husband treated me to a foot massage at Thai Royal Massage.  So, in Thailand a typical foot massage involves....well, massaging the feet, but also a mini Thai body massage which involves mostly compression and pressure points on top of your clothing to your back, legs, arms and scalp. Sometimes with reflexology massages they used to use this wooden stick for pressure points on the feet. I wasn't sure how similar this massage was going to be compared to what we experienced in Thailand, but was happily surprised that it was even better. I guess when you're paying US prices it should be, right?!  Well, not only was it a great massage but I feel it was very reasonably priced as well.  After massaging your feet and lower legs by hand, they used hot stones-which can be VERY hot if they stop moving for a second! Followed by the pressure point Thai massage to the upper legs, back, arms and scalp. It also involves some stretching as they twist your arms and legs a bit. You get more of this in a traditional Thai massage.  All in all it was great. The place is very clean and the lady at the front desk was very friendly and helpful.

I agree with Cesar G and Judy F. I had high hopes for this place when I saw the sign as I love vintage style. However, there was very few things that were truly vintage looking replicas, and yes they were overpriced for what they were. I left unexcited, uninspired, and empty handed.

I've been going to Kevin for some time now whenever the tension in my neck builds up and results in headaches. His studio is located in "the Quiet Center" of a small medical building on Miller Rd. He is incredibly skilled and knowledgeable in therapeutic massage and sometimes incorporates hot packs and hot stone therapy into his treatments. Not only will he provide a great therapeutic massage, but also stretch the affected area and in some cases, teach you self-stretches. When you walk in and tell Kevin your problem, you can see the wheels start to turn as he formulates a plan of attack. One time I walked into the clinic after tweaking a muscle in my neck somehow, and found him reviewing an anatomical text to see which would be the best place to start to help my problem. I love that!  He's easy to get in contact with and when I leave a message he's always called me back that same day, and usually can schedule me that same week.   Very professional, affordable, great therapist!!

Their happy hour menu has 2 beer selections for $3, $5 house red or white house wine, $4 wells and 1/2 priced apps everyday from 3-7pm. I was a little disappointed that once we got there all the apps weren't 1/2 priced, but most of them are around $5 so you can still get them and it won't break the happy hour bank. I really liked that they had a meat-free section for appetizers which included a giant bavarian pretzel, brussel sprouts, asparagus, cauliflower, etc. Great idea!!!! Throughout the course of our evening we ordered the escargot (try it you'll like it!!), the giant pretzel, the asparagus, and the brussel sprouts. I thought everything was delicious, although the sauce that accompanied the asparagus was a little heavy and congealed quickly....not appealing. My favorites were the escargot which sat on top of a delicious creamy puree (maybe artichoke?) and the brussel sprouts were glazed in honey mustard and sprinkled with parmesan cheese.  The house white and reds were pretty good actually, and my husband was impressed with their beer list, being more of a beer connoisseur.  It's not a huge place so there is limited inside seating. There are booths/tables behind the bar and a couple lounge areas as you first walk in. There is also an outdoor patio seating area, but somehow with the doors open you get the waft of cigarette smoke coming inside which I didn't like.  The decor is dim lighting, lots of wooden accents to give it that monastery feel.  There was a super cool sink in the ladies room...just had to mention that.  Service was friendly and attentive and overall everyone seemed to have a great attitude.

I purchased a Groupon for the Blackstone, which I had never heard of before. For $129 they offered a two night stay, checking in on Friday, and that included your resort fee and breakfast for each morning. Since Jenna C wrote her review they have now added a resort fee of $7.99 per day. This includes wi-fi and shuttle service to the strip, although we still tipped the drivers a couple bucks each time.  This used to be a Holiday Inn apparently, so they don't have a real sign up yet, only a banner. Decor is sparse and simple, but i kind of liked it that way. They have only one restaurant in the lobby area serving Mexican food, and if you're a guest they offer 2 for 1 cocktails. The breakfast deal was great because we could order anything off the menu. When I heard we got breakfast i thought it was a boring continental set up, so we were pleasantly surprised.  The rooms were very clean, had a large tv and desk (for the double queen) and standard amenities such as iron, hairdryer and coffee maker.  Plenty of parking underground and an elevator from the parking garage up to the floors makes it VERY convenient to unload your luggage. The shuttle service guys were GREAT! You are given two cell #s and you can call them when you want a ride. They operate from 7am-11pm and the maximum time we waited was 25 min.  Front desk was helpful and had speedy checkin/checkout service. I also liked that the hotel was 100% non-smoking and nice and quiet.

This is such a cool store and such a fun place to shop. They have everything you want for accessories: jewelry, scarves, hats, watches, bags, wallets, glasses, the list goes on.  It's conveniently organized by colors so you can shop by what you might need to match your style or clothing and there are so many items to choose from!! I find myself walking around the store so many times to make sure I haven't missed anything! Now the fun part is not just the huge selection, but the prices too. Items range from mostly $10-$30 with a few items above and below this, but it makes it affordable to try out a trend or experiment.  Very fun store!

Searsucker is nestled into the corner next to Neiman Marcus at Scottsdale Fashion Square. I've driven by so many times and hadn't seen it! Now having been for the yelp event last night I'm really glad I got to try it out.  The decor is very cool. Modern but with rustic elements and has touches of a southwest motif to match the desert.  The staff was great-both servers and bar staff were friendly and helpful. I really enjoyed the samplings of food we tried-especially the experience of the charcuterie table with various culinary offerings artfully displayed and open for indulging! Their full menu is organized into sections: smalls, bites, ocean, ranch, farm, greens, ands. Everything looks and sounds great although unfortunately for those of us who don't eat meat, many of the seafood and even green dishes include meat. So although I might not find too many items for dinner, I may be back to have a crafted cocktail in the lounge.

This Sprouts took over the Sunflower Farmers Market over the summer. There have been a few changes made with the new store. I like that there's a few more new products. There seems to be more to choose from. More selection overall with produce and a few shelved items like salad dressing and wine.  I'm finding the prices to be slightly more than Sunflower though. They certainly don't rank up there with Whole Foods prices, and a lot of their produce is still cheaper than the Frys on the same street.  I'm still a huge fan of the bulk section for saving $$$ I'm so glad they didn't get rid of that! Staff is helpful, especially the produce guys!!!

First Fridays has grown into itself in the past 8 years I've been living in the valley. What used to be a boring stroll through various galleries has now become a multitude of art, crafts, music, food, and brings people from all walks of life. There is so much more participation from vendors and businesses that it brings more of us out to support our local community! A win win!

Very cool downtown drink spot. If you're a beer fan this place if for you. It's bigger than you expect for a downtown establishment. Two large garage type doors open up to an outside patio also. Seating is wooden block tables and chairs with a few high bar tables along the back wall. The bar is laden with those cool hexagonal tiles and it's all taps. The large chalk board above boasts the beer name, type, and alcohol content. When a beer is tapped out for the night, they erase it. It reminded me of the big trading boards at the NYSE you see on tv.  Our server was very friendly and had a great smile. She checked on us often with made up for the turn around time being a bit slow-but they were super busy. I wasn't wowed by the menu-there were a few vegetarian options but they appeared the most unhealthy as well.  I did really enjoy my avocado salad which with its roasted beets, goat cheese, almonds and avocado was a meal in itself. We tried the spud tacos but I found them too greasy and salty.  Being a wine fan they offered 6 wines on tap, which I found very cool...how do I rig up one of those at home? I was confused to see about three tables with kids, as a new patron I was questioning is this a "family" place? I don't usually like my watering holes laden with the young folk, but with the moderate to high noise level you couldn't even hear them.  Tip: don't park in the large lot out back. They don't own it and there are signs in the bar that you'll be ticketed.

I had time before my flight and wanted a glass of wine to ease into travel mode. Blanco is located in terminal four, gate D and has a fairly large seating area. I didn't have to wait but a minute before getting seated. I would have opted for the bar, but that was full, so I got a table instead.  My server showed up a couple minutes later and I told her I just wanted a glass of red wine. Rather than bringing me a wine menu she asked me what kind....merlot, cabernet, malbec......"I'll have a malbec" I replied.  When she brought the wine over I asked for the check as well. Let me say how shocked I was to see a $20 charge for one single glass of wine!!! I stared at it and said "this is the most expensive glass of wine I've ever had...is this right?" She then replied "oh yah, I thought that was expensive too. I even double checked on the price to make sure that was right." Excuse me??? I love wine and all, but my palate doesn't discriminate on the cheap stuff. I've never even bought a bottle of wine for $20 never mind a single glass!  Needless to say, I thought it was rude of her that she double-checked with her bartender but didn't run over and say "hey, just wanted to make sure this was ok with you."  If I ever find myself here again, never will I trust one of their servers.

The floor plan of this place is so cool. The inside bar and seating area have large garage style windows that slide up so you have the feeling of open walls. There's an outside patio as well that apparently allows dogs too. We got a table inside by the bar and met some friends for happy hour. My husband thought they had a great beer selection, and for wine drinkers like myself they had about a handful of both reds and whites which were half off during happy hour.  They don't have many food options, and for vegetarians only one option: the portobello burger. It was good but for the burger only it was $10, fries are separate and extra $, which I think is pricey for some veggies and bread. If you like brats they have a few of those on the menu.  I liked that our server brought us a carafe of water and kept if filled throughout. If I run out of water I stop drinking....so maybe she knew exactly what she was doing! Nonetheless that's always worth a star in my book.

I've been out to the actual Queen Creek Olive Mill and it's a wonderful place for a day trip. If you don't live out in Queen Creek, it's a bit far though if you're craving something from their cafe or want to purchase some of their products. Behold! There is the Biltmore location that sells Queen Creek olive oils and vinegars as well as products made with their olive oil. They also have a cafe that sells delicious goodies-we got to sample some of their olive oil cupcakes!  Their products make great gifts too when you want to give someone a local AZ product! Glad to know this store is here!

I love HomeGoods and I'm so excited that one opened up in this location!!! They have such a great variety of items and styles, and it's organized well. Even within the sections it's color coded so it makes it really easy to search specifically if you're trying to find something to match an item in your home. I love the eclectic furniture pieces. They have something for everyone's taste and budget.

Don't let the name fool you-I'm still a veg-head, but surprisingly this place has something for everyone. Yes, they specialize in various meats and pickled vegetables. They are also all about local, farm fresh, homemade food, which is why it's so deeeelicious!  They have a few vegetarian items on the menu. The Nancy is a great brie and avocado sandwich, they have a homemade veggie burger, a vegetarian casserole which changes seasonally, and last night I tried the mussles which you can order with or without chorizo. They were delicious by the way. They also have an impressive mixed cocktail list with some classic old time favorites The both times we've been here they have had wonderful service. Attentive, friendly, polite, and professional.  There is a dog-friendly patio as well, and last night on a Friday evening they had live music inside.  So glad this place moved into the neighborhood!

Lindsey D. is right.... this place is way too popular! After enjoying dinner at Little Cleo's, my friend and I went over to the Yard for a drink. It was packed on a Saturday night! We had a hard time finding a place to sit but fortunately a large party was leaving one of the high top tables.  So after placing our order at the bar, we jumped on those open seats.  This is another one of those "awesome reasons to live in Arizona". Because you can enjoy and open concept bar in the middle of winter. The whole area was covered in green turf and had game tables like ping pong at the far end, and various other seating areas throughout. Heat lamps and fire pits kept the area relatively toasty as long as you were sitting near one of them. I got a glass of wine while my friend sipped a scotch. One of the servers apparently had an extra hard cider she must have poured and offered it to us. We saw a lot of servers running around-but honestly it was kind of hard to tell who was a server and who wasn't. No one really checked on us, but probably since we had a drink in hand they assumed we were all set.  The crowd is really mixed-people of all ages hanging out. I can't remember if there was music playing or not..... Cool place to check out, especially with a group of friends as their seating can accommodate large parties.

Very cool shops full of neat gifts and goodies. They are a little pricey but still fun to look around. You never know what you might find!  Old fashion candy, whimsical kitchen items, food products, clothing, etc. They often have live music as well!

Oh the Tanger Outlets...I don't know what it is about this "brand" of outlet mall vs others, but I first fell in love while living in Georgia where they also have a Tanger Outlet mall.  It seems that I always have good luck with them and this visit to the new Glendale location was no exception.  They have Banana Republic, Coach, Michael Kors, Gap, Polo, Tommy Hillfiger, a kitchen store....just to name a few. Large parking lot, plenty of restrooms.

This location was in the mall and easy to access via the overpass from the opposite side of the strip. My husband and I ordered plain brewed coffee, but they didn't have anymore of the blonde roast made. The guy said it would be ready in 2 min. We were in kind of a time crunch but stayed....it ended up being more like 10 min but he upgraded my small to a large so no one can complain about that!

What a cool concept! Not ice cream, not a slush, but more of a snow....or snoh. Choose your flavored snow, a topping, and a glaze (which is essentially a drizzle) on top. The menu isn't overwhelming with too many choices, which can be intimidating when you're trying something new. What they do have though, is really interesting. Taro flavored ice, mogi toppings, condensed milk glaze......it's very creative.  The place was very clean and decorated in contemporary IKEA style. I happen to love IKEA which is why I recognized the decor!  So what's the verdict? It's really refreshing and tasty. A very unique spin on a frozen treat. My only gripe is that the toppings and glaze were very light-handed, almost non existant. I just barely got to taste the tiny almond cookie crumbs and condensed milk on the top of my strawberry snow.

I think this was the first time the Hot Chocolate 5k/15k made an appearance in Phoenix, so with any new first time run I was sure there would be some bugs to work out. Well if there were, I had no idea. This race was so well organized, it made attending pure joy. I registered online a while ago and frequently got reminder emails and updates as time went on. With registration, each runner received a windbreaker-type jacket and a finishers mug with hot chocolate and fondue.  My running partner picked up my race packet and she said the process was very smooth and they even had sample size jackets to try on in case you needed to switch your size!! Parking on race morning was extremely well organized and there were so many port-o-potties that we didn't even have to wait. The race began on time and was a nice and simple jaunt through salt river fields. Not much to say by way of scenery, but no matter. It was still nice and flat! At the end we all enjoyed our hot chocolate and fondue-which was delicious :) What a fun event!!!

I bypassed this establishment for a long time thinking that the name referred to a meat-heavy menu. Thanks to my fellow yelpers I learned that that is not the case at all! Their menu is full of fresh, tasty, healthy food. Salads, sandwiches, juices, breakfast. It's very casual: order at the counter, receive a number, find a table. My husband ordered a protein bowl with shrimp, and I tried the beet salad with tofu. I thought both of them were delicious!!! Days after I'm still thinking about that salad! Decent value too. I saw a lot of people getting take-out from here....not a bad idea.

Girls' night out at Bink's Midtown. Located near 24th st. and Osborn this is one of those small, cozy, house-style restaurants that I so love about living in Phoenix. The menu is clean, simple, and specializes in small tasting plates. There are a handful of appetizers, entrees (which as our server explained are essentially just the protein and sauce) salads, and then hot and cold produce plates.   As a non-meat eater, I found the main menu a bit limiting. Mostly everything had meat in it somewhere. I chose the cod entree which was expertly cooked. Somehow they managed to elevate this seemingly simple white fish into a tender, flavorful wonder! I also ordered the onion tart with sweet roasted onion, tomato and ricotta. I was scraping the plate.   My girlfriends did more of a tasting menu and as small plates came through I heard rave reviews about the bone marrow and sweet breads.   Just when you think you're not going to have dessert, the menu comes and you glance at it....ok then you have to get dessert. I ordered the pudding cake. Served in a mason jar it's three layers of essentially a pudding-thick chocolate cake (think more pudding than cake), a graham cracker crumble which gives an amazing crunch to the pudding below, and topped with a cinnamon marshmallow fluff. It's a little tricky to eat and get all three layers at once, but it's a sacrifice I was willing to make. A couple of my girlfriends ordered the strawberry shortcake and although I kept hearing them say they couldn't finish it...there was none left on the plate when the table was cleared.   Our server did a nice job of allowing us six women plenty of time to talk to each other in between coming back to take orders or check on us. I never felt rushed and the evening had a nice pace to it. We always had water on our table. Overall it was a wonderful evening of good people and good food.

Our waiter described Evo as Italian with a fancy flare. I don't usually choose Italian restaurants but this one would definitely get a repeat visit from me! They have an impressive wine list, many available by the glass, and their cocktails are also stellar. I sampled the ones my husband ordered and they were delicious!   We started with a featured app of shrimp bruschetta. The shrimp had a nice chili oil drizzled on top and the bread was crispy but not over-cooked.  I ordered the salmon which came on top of pearl couscous and a side of brussel sprout leaves, which turned out to be actual brussel sprouts. The salmon was cooked wonderfully and the couscous appeared to be a mixure of wheat/white pearls with red pepper.   My husband ordered the lobster risotto, to which I kept stealing bites of! We finished off the evening with the chocolate torte dessert and the zeppolini doughnuts. The torte was dense and rich and sort of fun and playful since it came with nutella sauce and marshmellow with crispy almonds. The doughnuts were a bit savory with a sweet berry dipping sauce. Both were phenomenal.   Our server had a great attitude and a great smile. Our water glasses were kept full all night....awww it's like they knew me.   Their happy hour menu looks amazing by the way!!!! Great food options for $5, beer for $3, wine and well specials.

We returned for a Saturday night happy hr and sat at the bar. Both my husband and I were commenting on how the ambience has a nice warm feel to it. A coziness, if you would. Our bartender was very friendly and both of us got wine on tap for $5. Wine on tap you ask? Oh yes, and it was goooood.  Their food selection for HH includes a few pizzas, which looked and smelled great, and a couple other small plates. We were just in for a quick drink so we'll have to sample something next time. I think we need to start coming here more often!

We stopped in here on a Saturday afternoon after a petwalk on Tempe town lake, so we had four dogs in tow. Since this new patio opened they allow dogs! Yay! We were warned by the hostess that they were short staffed but she brought us waters right away. We did end up waiting quite a while. Normally I would have gotten up and left, and at one point I told my friend that I might be heading out. I guess there was confusion between the only two servers and they thought we had already been helped.   Once they got that squared away the server we had was friendly and kept checking on us. We just got drinks and by looking at their menu they seem to specialize in whiskey cocktails. Two of my friends got a mimosa carafe for $10, which was on special. I had a glass of wine for $8.   The hostess really is what made me stay. She was so sweet and also brought water for our dogs, and came back around to refill their bowls. Like I said, usually if I have to wait that long for my cocktail I just want to leave. However the service we did have was good and you can usually win over a dog owner if you are good to our furry friends. So for this reason they get four stars from me.

Wow! How did I not know about this place before now? Coconut's Fish Cafe is a surf-style eatery with surf board tables and benches. There is outdoor seating as well, but you order first from the counter and then they bring the food to your table. They have casual food like fish tacos, fish burgers, fries, onion rings, veggie burgers, etc.   I ordered the fish burger and you can choose between 2 or 3 types of fish and what style you'd like it (spicy, salt and pepper, blackened, etc.) I opted for the mahi mahi, spicy style. It was a good size for a little over $10 and topped with a tomato and their signature coleslaw.  Sides are extra. Very messy to eat, but so, so delicious. My one negative comment was that the fish was slightly overcooked, but it didn't stop me from inhaling the whole thing.  My husband got the fish tacos. Also very, very messy to eat but super tasty.  The staff was genuinely friendly for a place that you order at the counter. Dogs are not allowed on their patio, just an FYI. And I wouldn't recommend this as a first date spot or anytime you want to be "neat" with your food. Be aware, you'll get some on you.

This studio has undergone some wonderful "sprucing" up since changing owners and linking together with the PV studio! New paint and carpeting in the hot room, a larger womens' locker room and an updated lobby with additional retail.  This studio is small to begin with, so there isn't much room to expand, but it seems they've made better use of space with what they have. There is still only one shower in the women's locker room-but now an additional bathroom, mirrors, and hooks/shelves to store your stuff.  One of the coolest things is the new water bottle filtered fountain! Yay for refillable bottles and eliminating extra plastic!! I love that students can go to either studio (Old Town or PV) and take advantage of all those class times. The re-vamped schedule is lookin' good too! Nice work!!

My friend treated me to a birthday dinner. When she had asked if I've ever been to Little Cleo's I said no I hadn't, and I've never been to a Fox restaurant I didn't like. Guess what, this one was awesome too.  Located within "The Yard" it's smaller than I was expecting. It has a large counter-style seating area around the kitchen (which is all open), and then a row of tables along the main window. Despite the two walls of windows it had a cool "underground" feel, perhaps due to the stark white subway tiles. We arrived about 8:00 on a Saturday night and sat at the counter area. The menu looks really delicious: small plates, large entree plates, vegetable dishes, sides, we had a difficult time deciding which items to try!  Rather than each getting a large entree we opted for a bunch of smaller plates.   The grilled octopus and masa cake Blue crab toast Grilled broccolini and romanesco Swiss chard Cole slaw Buttermilk pie for dessert  Everything was delicious, everything. My favorite was the grilled octopus and the broccolini/romanesco. We took our time, talked, ate everything. It was awesome. Service was very friendly and the food arrived very promptly after placing our order. They also have a neat cocktail selection and a few wines by the glass.  Will definitely be back to try more off their menu!

This is a neat desert attraction for anyone who likes butterflies. They start you off with a 3D movie Flight of the Monarch-which teaches you a lot and shows some gorgeous scenes. Second, you get to view real butterflies in their cocoons-some of which are hatching out! Thirdly is the large room full of butterflies floating around you. If you've ever been to the butterfly exhibit at the DBG and enjoyed it, you will love this one. I found there to be so much more "movement". Butterflies everywhere, many of which land on you.  As much as I loved it, once it enough. It's very family-friendly so it was packed with strollers and children screaming through the movie.

I had been interested in removing my very first tattoo and heard about this place through Groupon. They are located within the Ageless Mi Medspa in Old Town, which is small, but clean.  I met with Paul, the owner before I actually bought the groupon to talk details.   The laser technician measured the area and explained that black tattoos are easier to remove than color, and the older they are the better. Ok good, as mine is all black and 20yrs old.   You have to fill out a whole medical packet, as it's technically a medical service or procedure. I returned today for my first session. The laser tech was very nice and explained the process in detail. She applied a numbing cream to the tattoo and I waited about 15 min for that to soak in. I'm not sure if it even did anything, but I'm not willing to try the service without-just in case it did help!   So what everyone wants to know is how much did it hurt? Well, it was bad. I have many other larger tattoos for which I have sat hours at a time, and that pain does not compare to this. After a few seconds she was halfway through and I asked for a short break to which she applied some ice and let me see what it looked like. She assured me that we can take as much time as I needed, but I wanted to just get it done with so she finished up. The good thing is that if you can just tolerate it, the process is actually quick.    She reviewed the aftercare instructions and I left there with a small container of aloe vera, and my next appt scheduled for 4wks. I have many more sessions ahead of me apparently. They say it can take anywhere from 10-15 and there are no guarantees. We'll see how it goes!

I'm writing this follow-up review for customer service. At the start of my tattoo removal venture I purchased two groupon-priced packages from Paul, the owner. Each one was for 3 treatments.  Now, tattoo removal hurts, but what I didn't realize was with each successive treatment, the machine has to be turned up to be effective at removal, and that comes with more pain. Personally, I didn't feel the numbing cream was very effective. By the third treatment I could barely make it through the session, and I'm someone who can sit for hours in the tattoo chair getting one put on.  I told Maureen, the laser tech that I wouldn't be coming back to complete my package as I just couldn't tolerate the pain. She was so sweet and understanding and offered to mention it to Paul. We spoke on the phone and through email and he was very professional and accommodating to issue me a refund on the remaining treatments I hadn't used.  Fantastic customer service, and for this reason they still get 5 stars from me.

I'm glad the tickets weren't too expensive, because I wasn't particularly thrilled with this event. Granted, I think it was organized pretty well. I liked having it at the Biltmore (although I wasn't at the one last year at the Science Museum-which sounded cool), the staff did a great job of helping to clear the high top tables, and it was fairly easy to get a cocktail from the many bars around the room.   However, I agree with Kelly V: why were these random non-food-related companies there? Some of them didn't even have a representative sitting at their table?!  Also, there were only a handful of vegetarian dishes available. Most other food events I've attended will at least have fish/seafood options in addition to vegetarian. I think I had perhaps 4 items, aside from desserts, that did not have meat. I was especially disappointed when I approached the tamale stand (I don't recall the company) who had a large sign boasting vegetarian tamales, only to find out that they didn't bring one to sample!!! They had two options-both meat. Gee thanks. If I don't get to sample it why would I drive out to your restaurant? What makes yours better? Sell me a little people, you're supposed to be the "best!"  I did enjoy the desserts, for which there was a lot of....I'd say at least 50% of the food was dessert. But after a few sugary treats I was jonesing for something savory and didn't have any luck. I think I'll stick with Devoured, and skip the A'Fare next year.

The former Imperial Palace is undergoing some big renovations. So far the lobby and casino floor are looking way different. You no longer enter from the front-the lobby drop off is on the side by the outdoor Harrah's Bar. The Rock Bar that used to sit on the strip is gone, but the other restaurants inside are still there. I'm so glad nothing happened to the Hash House a Go Go!  The new carpet is typical gaudy Vegas carpeting, but the tile flooring is looking good. The lobby check in system needs to be faster, and maybe setup differently. It moves way too slow.  The gaming floor looks smaller in size, but it's not finished yet so I'm sure more is on the way. The rest of the Quad looks exactly the same. The horribly slow elevators, the buckled, dirty carpeting in the hallways, and the outdated drab hotel rooms. I met two friendly hotel staff members (the lady who checked us in at the desk who was also from Scottsdale, and our maid). Otherwise, everyone else seemed tired, unfriendly, like they hated their job and weren't afraid to let it show. Then why have I stayed here so many times? Well, it's cheap, and the location can't be beat. I'd much rather save some money staying here and spend it elsewhere in Vegas. Make sense right? I had better experiences at the old IP but maybe better times are on the horizon for The Quad.

As a chain, Ulta is not a bad store. I shop there quite a bit. It's just unfortunate that this location is the one close to me.   I go there with my list, get my stuff, and usually get out. Its not a location I enjoy browsing in. The customer service is lacking. I get this weird sense that the staff would rather be....anywhere....other than at work. I brought in a coupon today for $3.50 off any $10 purchase and as the sales associate at the register was ringing my items she told me that I had to spend $10 in order to use it.   Yah, I know that's why I was buying a mascara for $6.99 and a lipliner for $3.39......what's the issue?   Don't give up on the chain itself, just try another location.

For those of us who believe we should've been born during a different era....or at least dress like we were....there is Kitten Retro Glamour. This amazingly cute boutique offers classic vintage fashion, but from new labels like Pinup Couture and Tatyana Designs. I usually buy all my pinup and vintage-inspired fashion online or during trips to Las Vegas. Thankfully Kitten opened up right here in Phoenix!! Not only is the boutique so cute and pink and girly, but the owners little touches go a long way toward good customer service and repeat business. I couldn't believe the cuteness of her pink pastry gift boxes and hand written thank-you napkins placed in my shopping bag. She was amazingly helpful as my sister tried on dresses and I perused the accessories and gushed over her new store. Thank you for opening up locally! Now I can get my fix anytime I want!!!!
