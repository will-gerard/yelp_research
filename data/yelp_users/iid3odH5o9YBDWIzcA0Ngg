Before I give my review   I moved here from Texas and we  have excellent quality Mexican food on every corner. Down to the homemade tortillas and fresh homemade salsa and chips that are always free at every Mexican restaurant. It's an expectation there. So sadly im here still wondering where I'm going to find my chips and salsa for free..booo..lol.  SERVICE I walked into this place thinking ahhh it's another filibertos place and it will taste the same. From the time I walked in, I was greeted and treated like I was one of their friends. He went above expectations just by letting me know they have a closer location to where I live and asking if the food was great and salsa.   THE FOOD Steak potato and cheese burrito was ordered. I haven't had a great burrito in a long time. Plenty of meat and taters as the country folks would say in Texas. It was amazingly excellent. Nothing fancy about the burrito, this goes where they say...Keep it simple stupid....they did just that....and that makes this burrito....darn good!!!  Chicken Tacos, were ordered. The guy really knows his stuff and makes ordering easier. He asked if I wanted one or two and then when I said two, he said you might as well go with the #17 or something like that for .14 cents more and get yourself a drink. I did just that. Back to the tacos. I was expecting some super hard shelled taco with hardly any cheese and little meat. I was wrong. The tortilla was fried lightly which is the exact way I love making my own corn tortilla tacos at home. I was surprised with that part already and the amount of cheese way more then you would get at taco bell anyday. The tacos are excellent.  Breakfast Burritos-I went back the next morning I ordered the potato, cheese, ham and bean taco. Wow!! Amazing with plenty of cheese and the greatest red tasting hot sauce I've had around.  Don't hesitate to ask me any questions....I prefer this place and will go out of my way to get here than to go to Filabertos!

My sister was leaving back to Texas and I decided to find a BBQ place that may have a similar taste and feel. I found this place through a Mesa newspaper ad.  Anywho, as we pulled in I was like I hope this place is good. We parked in the back and walked along the side where you can order your food to go. As we waited we decided to head inside and as we walked through the dining area to the line, I was already eyeballing other peoples plates. I could see the ribs and at that point I couldn't decided on a plate, but went ahead with the plate that had everything.  I ordered Ribs, Pork, and chicken and as I was ordering I seen some sausage come out of their bbq oven. So I didn't even hesitate because every since I've moved here from Texas, I have yet to find a place to have the yummy peppery tasting sausage we have back home. I asked for a piece of it for tasting and was granted a taste. Needless, to say I ordered a quarter lb with everything else I ordered.  The chicken was without a doubt great smoked bbq chicken I have always wanted. Great flavor with not an overbearing smoke flavor. Also the ribs were tender and packed with flavor and smoke taste. The smoked pork was smoke tasty but a little on the sweeter side, but that was nothing the Habenero BBQ couldn't accommodate. Which is offered on the side. Oh and the bread tasted like some homemade goodness bread. As if it was fresh out of the oven with a little garlic butter. Superb! The Mac and cheese was super duper great.  In Texas, we have bbq joints in every corner. I have tried it all and I will have to say this is one place I would have on my top list if we had it there.  BIG bbq sauce thumbs up for this joint!!

I would love to give a 5 star rating except my mashed potatoes and vegetables come to the table cold. I haven't said anything and even though they are cold they are still good.  Service: The staff is friendly and they are great about waiting on you. They are very helpful when your wanting to know what the specials are, which changes on a daily basis.  The Food: For me I love a down right good home made chicken fried steak dinner. I'm one of those good ol texas boys that loves to eat meat and potatoes. The potatoes are really good and seem to be real potatoes. If they are fake, then they have fooled me. The brown gravy I usually ask for on the side is really good. You can also get a homemade biscuit and that by itself is a meal of it's on. You can tell its homemade. The best part of all is the chicken fried steak. You can look at it and tell the batter is from scratch and nice and crunchy and very flavorful when it goes down the tube. If your looking for a really great chicken fried steak dinner thats homemade with all the fixins......this is the place to go to. Got room for desert? You are crazy if you do. Be prepared for an all time mini pie maybe a 10 incher or less. Either way it's big and they have plenty of different homemade pies to chose from, just ask the waitress. I ordered the Banana Cream, let's just say it was bananas.....no way could I eat it all.   Needless to say I brought mom here before and I'll continue to go here.

Listen up follow Mexican food eaters!!!!  If your looking for some really great Mexican food in this valley. This is the place to go, especially for "Real Ground Beef Enchiladas".   The Service: I would say very good friendly and sociable and always comes to check on ya.  The Food: WOWZERS The food is amazing. I've been in Arizona for roughly a year or more and this place is hands down the best. I ordered a special that had a tamale and cheese enchilada with rice and beans. I upgraded my cheese enchilada to beef for a $1.00 more which is nothing. Now the tasting, the rice....how do I say this....ohhhh eeem geee....haha. Super amazing by itself, I can probably eat the rice by itself for an entire plate and be simply satisfied. They do start you off with salsa that is chunky and they have one in a ketchup bottle that is super amazing. I have no idea whats in it, but wow its good. Anyways, back to the food. The tamale was ok, but the enchilada was to die for. I had the red sauce and man oh man when I found out it was ground beef....I thought I was in Texas again. I had to slap myself out of it. The enchilada dinner here is by far the best. I think I'll try the fajitas next time around. Can't wait to get back in there.  Thanks guys for having such great food. It's too bad your way out in phoenix or else I'd be a for sure regular in the east valley.

Service- The girls there are always nice and friendly, the food comes out pretty fast, but sometimes the breakfast burritos aren't always what you order so make sure you check your bag before you leave or else. It usually stays clean inside and out.  Food-I've tried everything, but nothing really makes me want to come back, I only go back for my grandparents who seem to just accept this place as a mexican joint near the house. Id' say if the hot sauce went to the tomatoe type hot sauce and they had chips, it would help as well as a smaller choice of tacos with "homemade tortillas" it would separate themselves as an acceptable mexican restaurant.  As you can see I don't have much to say about a certain type of plate because they are easily forgettable. STEP UP your game a little my friends. Although, I'll still come back with my grandparents. This is my review.

The Service-Very fast and attentitive, doesn't seem like you have to fight your way in and wait long for a drink. The bartenders and cocktail waitresses as I call them, were very cute and full of smiles. They all seem to like their jobs and enjoy what they are doing.  Drinks are pricey but worth it for the top shelf stuff. I'm not in much for wells anyways.  The Atmosphere- It ranged anywhere from the newly 21's up to the older lost lions. I thought it was a great atmosphere with plenty of pretty girls. You should dress to impress fellas and girls even thought I would have denied jeans. I did see a few nicely seated jeans so I'm not going to deny that you should were them.   I met Giovanni who was a very down to earth type of guy. He was part of the live band last night. I didn't get to hang around long enough to buy the entire group a drink, but maybe I'll do that next time around.  Overall, I will come back. I'll plan to stay in the area so I can have an even more eventful fun time.

WOW! Is all I have to say. I'm from Texas and I've been looking for a place just like this. Cheap and very very good!  I got the chicken fajitas to go.The fajitas were mixed in with colorful bell peppers and cooked onions. The homemade tortillas was there to compliment the mix. The also put a great portion of beans and rice. To my surprisement there were also guacamole, pico de gallo, and sour cream ready to put inside my torn off tortilla.  I have moved here about a year ago and this is my place I love more than any chain or off chain restaurant for mexican food. It's almost as if I'm right at home.

Parking: It's a little sketchy with the barber shop next door but still not bad, plenty of parking.  Entrance: Greeted by a couple of cashiers not sure which is willing to take my order.   Food: I order jalapeno sausage and regular sausage to see what the two were like. Mind you guys my review has a 31 years of experience of Texas bbq eatin. Always about the good ol sausage. However, this was not the experience I was looking for. I got it to go and when I got to where I was going, I decided to dive into the Jalapeno sausage and after unwrapping it, just by looking at I notice it looked super dry. I was even afraid to take a bite of it. I did it anyways and it was disgusting, I wouldn't have served that to any guys. Owners if you are going to use the Texas name, you sure as the hell need to get it together. You're not representing Texas in great spirit. I'm actually kind of upset your using the name and selling that crap to anyone for that matter. I'm not going to discredit the regular sausage because it wasn't as dry and tasted pretty good. But let's just say the jalapeno sausage left a bad taste behind.  Why not a 5: Well no need to go into details, hopefully you fix your issues, not sure how you became highly rated, but I'm in hopes my next visit I'll be able to see why. True Texan believes in second chances.

Coming from Texas I'm very suspicious that I'm going to get a store bought tortilla when eating Mexican food in Arizona. I had a feeling the carnivore type tacos would have an awesome mesquite flavor but I didn't get to try it this time around.  It doesn't have a drive thru but it's a real simple to order take out or eat in. My hunt was for a breakfast burrito still served anytime of the day. I ordered a burrito with eggs,ham,potatoes, beans, and cheese. The smell of the wonderful mesquite makes me want to come back for a burger or taco which I well. Anyhow, I got my salsa at the salsa bar while waiting and I receive my to go order shortly after. I left and in the car open the burrito and to my surprise a homemade tortilla with fresh ingredients still at 11:30am. The reason from my 5 is the homemade tortillas with all the goodness inside.

The service was great. From the moment we walked in the manager greeted us and took us straight to our table. The atmosphere was welcoming and relaxing. Our waiter was knowledgeable and friendly. They had a full coffee service with espresso and cappuccino which was perfect after a long day. We tried the fried soft boiled egg as an appetizer that was recommended by the server. It was something out of the ordinary. It turned out to be great and a nice twist compared to the deviled eggs.   As far as the food, the risotto was the perfect texture and full of flavor. The salmon came out a little under done to my liking, but it was my fault for not asking. For others it may have been perfect. It was expressed, taken care of delightfully, and much appreciated. The glaze on the salmon was amazing and went well the rest of the rice and vegetables it sat on.  I would highly recommend dessert. The cinnamon bread pudding is well worth the extra wait. We will definitively be returning.

Parking: This one is not so hard to figure out for my generation but with all do respect for the over 60 generation you may have a hard time understanding where to park. I parked as close as I could looking for the entrance of the place. Park as closest to the street as you can facing west.  Entrance: If you are new, the very first doors on the left hand side. Great sign says wait to be seated. There's bar seating and regular dining seating.  Waiter: Mine gave me the drink special menu, I was there during happy hour. He made sure my drink was full all the time.  The Food:       In my opinion, most Mexican restaurants around just don't cut it in Arizona but this one does.The food is usually not fresh or there is a lack of quality somewhere. The waiter started me off with chips and salsa. Chips are averaged, the salsa above averaged. I ate the whole bowl of it, pretty darn good.         Next, I ordered the Carne Guisada, which no one Arizona probably know what that is. However, in Texas it's one of the tacos I had ordered at least every other Mexican meal. It's like a Mexican seasoned gravy with steak. Even says a southern Texas favorite. The waiter came back to let me know they didn't have it for the day, talked about feelings went sour. For once, I thought I found my favorite Carne Guisada taco and now they don't have it. Not super upset, but upsetting because I didn't get to try it, stay tuned for the next trip.         The carne asado taco topped with onions, cilantro, slices of Serrano peppers, and salsa of somesort, on a corn tortilla. It was packed with meat so don't think they skimp with all the extra stuff. The meat very fresh to the taste almost seemed as if it had some smokey flavor to it. Gotta love it when you can tell the meat wasn't sitting in a container waiting for the next order, you could tell it was cooked to order. Now, lets move on to the Pork Belly. Mind you, I had Pork Belly the previous day at Flemmings and between the two tacos, I'd choose Paz because of the 15 hour packed flavors it claims on the menu. I'm not only a believer of the 15 hours, but a fan of these tacos. The pricing of food is where it should be for the quality.        I give it a 4 because the Carne Guisada was not available when I ordered it. Otherwise, you would of received a 5 from me. I really hope you guys have it available the next time I come in, was also told to try the shrimp tacos next.

Parking: Eyyyyy not so bad, plenty of parking. In the hope your kids do not read the sign of those special kakes next door out loud...lol  Entrance: I notice they have tables and chairs outside, along side with a couple of doggie water bowls. Assuming, its "Pet Friendly" makes it a homie place to grab a bite to eat.  Inside the restaurant:  We walk in and there's not much to know whether someone is going to seat you or you seat yourself until you stand for a moment watching others. The ahh hah light bulb comes in and you notice you order your food, take a number, and have a seat. Off to the right, you'll notice the different types of coffee on the menu and in the middle there is a cash register. Behind the cash register at the top of the wall is the food menu.   The Food: I order the Croquet Monsieur and the Mocha Iced Coffee. It didn't take too long for our order to come out. The aged cheddar that the menu claims this good Croquet has, is what drew me to order it. As it sat on my table I tried to determine whether I had an omelet or a melted cheddar covered sandwich. Well it was the sandwich with flavorful cheese and ham melted inside. I never had one but I have to say I loved every bite of it. I noticed a side of greens to it and decide to dip into that with a fork. Had a bit of a salt flavor with some kind of Italian or vinaigrette dressing. I'm not a fan of salads but I ate it all. Sisters boyfriend asked if I'd like to try some of the french toast he ordered. Well that was a shocker, I tried it, seem to be a possible normal french toast, except that citrus flavor came out. I would have never thought the two would work, but wow, that was good. I'll have to get that next time. Good job whoever invented that one.  The Ending and Why not a 5: They do have waiters come around from time to time to see if anything else is needed, so they don't just leave you to the tables, don't worry. I would have given it a full 5 but it's not a location near me. Also, the food is excellent but it's something I would have to of grown up on. If it was chicken fried stick and eggs, would go back more than once a month. This could be a new entry for breakfast for me, maybe at some point it could hit the home cooking gut and make a 5. Keep up the excellent above average service and food, you guys are bringing something very different to the breakfast table. Everyone can appreciate that.
