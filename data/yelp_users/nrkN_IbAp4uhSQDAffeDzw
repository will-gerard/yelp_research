If I could give them zero stars - I would! They deserve negative stars! I purchased a Scion xB with a 'full warranty' for my wife last year and it has been nothing but a hassle. The tires went bad after a month and they would do nothing about it. They messed up the registration and I had to pay the whole cost out of my own pocket. They messed up the payment on my trade-in and that cost me time and money to clear up. They are rude and a bunch of liars. You could not pay me to do business with Riverview again.

We ordered BBQ for a work party. They gave us a good deal and the food arrived on time. Everything was great!
