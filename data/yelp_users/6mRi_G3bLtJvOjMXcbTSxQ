Had a nice day here until I came back at night and was accused of walking out on my tab earlier that same day. I closed out with my waitress in cash. I grabbed a manager and told him about the situation and I pointed out the waitress to him he then opened her book and she was pocketing all cash transactions. I then checked my bank and my card was ran for the bill I already paid in cash. I had to call my bank and have the transaction cancelled. I was not offered an apology nor was the waitressfired. I will never go to this place again.

Called Mr Clean Carpet Care on Sunday the only other place that was open and they were able to come out the very next day and worked with my schedule. While running around I got a flat tire on the west side of town and they gave me extra time and still came out late and cleaned my carpets. My Carpets looked great and was very happy they worked with my situation to get the job done. Would recommend Mr Clean Carpet Care to anyone.

My girlfriend and I came in on a Wednesday for HH and the place was packed but got a table and we had the best server Christian. We both work in the service industry and Christian was very helpful and suggested many different drink options as well as being very knowledgable on food items. For how full the place was our food came out in a very timely manner. After eating we ended up staying another hour or so based on Christian being very energetic as well as the atmosphere. We also got a complementary desert from Christian which was their Monkey Bread which was awesome. Will be coming back for sure for HH next week.
