Horrible dentist. Tried to upsell me on literally everything and told me I needed six fillings replaced (that had been done all within the last few years). Plus the facility itself was dirty. Gross!

Great fast service! He arrived in less than ten minutes and had our car open instantly! Definitely recommend!  It cost $50 to unlock the car, and $60 if we had a credit card. Based on the four other places I called, I thought it was a great value for the service.

Horrible service!  My friends and I (party of 6) arrived at 7:00 and were told it would be a 30 to 35 minute wait.  At 7:50 we were finally seated.    Next, my friends ordered sushi and I ordered a chicken salad. Big mistake.  All of the sushi came out at different times, and finally at 8:25 I asked where my salad was. 8:35 the server comes back and says they accidentally cooked it with dark meat and asked if I still wanted it with white meat, to which I replied yes, I wanted it with white meat. (My friends were done eating at that point.) He then unapologetically stated that will be another 10-15 minutes.    8:50 he brings out the salad and I ask for a fork. 8:55 he comes back with cheater chopsticks and tells me they are all out of forks.  I mean REALLY?!?  Long story short, my friend stood up for me and told them to comp my salad, which they did, but the manager never came out to apologize.    And no, I did not eat my salad with chopsticks; I took it home to eat instead.  Good food.  It's a shame they have such lousy service.

I have been going to Biagio nails for about a year and a half now and I have never found a place better than this (and I've tried a lot of nail salons)! Kevin is the absolute best and does gel nails which is difficult to find.  I've had other places do my gel nails before and find that his application of the gel is superior and makes the nails last longer.    Everyone at Biagio nails is great.  Their store is extremely clean, looks very high end, and the nail techs are very sweet and fun to talk to.  I have been happy everytime I've gone here and will keep going back.  I do recommend that you make an appointment.  They can usually accommodate you that day, but they get booked up if you do a walk-in.  If there were more than 5 stars they would have earned them!!!
