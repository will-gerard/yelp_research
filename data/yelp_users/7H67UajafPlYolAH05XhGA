The tempura orange roughy has ruined me on all other food. It was possibly the most delicious thing I have ever had. The coating was crunchy, but not rough and the sauce it came in was rich and delicious! My husband is constantly dragging me to Chinese places that serve mediocre noddle dishes with so much salt, I can barely finish them, but this was a pleasant surprise! The atmosphere was lovely and the green tea ice cream was amazing! Cannot wait to go back. Oh yeah, it's incredibly reasonable for the food your getting. We couldn't believe how little we paid for such fantastic food!

Dr. Rai, although direct, is amazing with my dogs. They always call the next day to make sure the dogs are alright after any shots or tests. They even squeeze me in the same day if something comes up.

I am sad to see the reviews about the poor service because I know exactly which server they had..  and I don't blame them. (The rest of the servers are so friendly, though!)  However, this is one of my favorite hang-outs. We live just down the street, so we go at least once a week. The food is out of this world! The wings, burgers, tacos, and sandwiches are so great! Tuesdays are free comedy, Wednesdays are free trivia, and they have karaoke almost every night. One of my favorite aspects of this bar is the mixed crowd. After showing up a few times, the staff and the regulars were waving and saying they were happy to see us again. The crowd sings everything from top 40 to Pantera to oldies. It's definitely a dive, but if you're looking for a friendly crowd, phenomenal food, and giant mugs of beer, this is your place.

I love this store. I found it via google for my sister because it was locally owned and operated. She loved it so much, she took me there first after I got engaged. They were able to squeeze me in without an appointment on a Saturday and the saleswoman was full of so many good ideas. She helped me with so many little touches/alterations that I could make to my dress that made it totally my own. She even respected my wishes not to spend a fortune and found me EIGHT dresses (that matched my desired look) to try on under $500! She even fetched an array of different veils, sashes, and brooches and helped me come up with some really good ideas to make my dress a little more conservative without looking matronly. I have never received such lovely service in my life. No joke. I recommended this store to a handful of people already!

Despite delicious food and an impressive wine list, it hurts my heart to say that this place isn't worth the trouble. The staff is pretentious and unaccommodating. I have been here a handful of times and every server I have had has an excuse of why they cannot meet my requests. I understand a policy of not splitting checks, but then please let us know that when you are taking our order. One of the servers also told me that they cannot seat parties of five without a reservation. I understand having to wait for a table, but the place was just opening and nearly empty at the time. The menu also gives very vague descriptions making it nearly impossible for anyone with specific food allergies. I love my wine, but I am pretty comfortable with the fact that I will never go to this place again.

Hiring Chadwick Fowler at Modern Wedding Scenes ended up being the best decision we made for our wedding. The photography and video was especially important to my husband and I so we were pretty picky about selecting who would be taking the pictures. Chad was not only the first person to call us back, but also to be flexible on what we could include in our budget. He is professional, personable and fun to be around. His talent is comparable to the photographers and videographers that tried to charge us three times as much for the same services. He takes his craft incredibly seriously right down to the detail he puts into editing. I am floored by how meticulous and specific he is while shooting. I've looked through the pictures a handful of times already and only have a small portion of the video that is ready for viewing, but still get a little choked up! He precisely captured the story of our big day along with every smile, laugh, and tear that went into it. The only bad part of the whole experience is narrowing down which pictures I want in the album.. I love them all too much!  Please check out our video (although it's just the trailer for now) and our album!  http://vimeo.com/39732128  http://modernweddingscenes.zenfolio.com/arriagawedding (password is: arriaga)

This is a fun little place with an amazingly diverse menu and out-of-this-world food. The beer list has everything from $2 Mickey's to gourmet brews. The menu offers small, light salad for me and grilled, steak-filled sandwiches for my husband. It has a fun and easy atmosphere with incredibly nice staff. I have only been here a few times, but it is becoming a new favorite!

This place was a fun and refreshing alternative to the conventional restaurant for date night. The menu offers creative combinations of toppings and then you pick the style of sausage you want and it's all served on warm naan. At first, I was given the wrong order, but the staff was friendly, quick to apologize and fixed their mistake. The food truck scene allows us to bring the dog and for $20, we had a delicious meal and a change of scenery. Awesome.

I absolutely adore Dr. Judy. She's thorough, thoughtful, and genuinely cares. I paid out of pocket to see her after my regular NP of sixteen years wasn't able to offer me any solutions to some of the problems that I was experiencing. Dr. Judy fixed everything I was experiencing. Even the things that I didn't think were that big of symptoms. As it would turn out, every single one of my symptoms was connected and had a fairly simple solution. She saw it all and was super kind! Just make sure you block out a few hours for your appointment. She wants to know everything and she'll work to fix it. So that will take a while!

This place is delicious and the staff is tons of fun. The restaurant is small and beautiful on the inside. Pho is one of my favorite foods and this place has my favorite broth, hands down. I am addicted to the pho ga and my husband loves the Bun Cha Gio Thit Nurong (B3). Both are delicious. We probably eat here at least once a week.
