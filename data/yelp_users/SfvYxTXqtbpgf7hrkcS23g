This Taco Bell is always on point. Last night the drive thru guy took our order in a spooky Halloween voice (it was Oct 31) and gave us all a great experience getting some late night munchies. And it's Taco Bell so the food was obviously heavenly

This place is cool. Went to 90s hip hop night. Drinks are fairly priced, the employees are nice, and the DJ was good. There is a lot of room on the patio if you don't want to be in the lounge. Would go back!

The food was delicious (swordfish & green chile burger). However, the service was terrible. I don't even know who our server was. Don't know if I'll be back.

I came here on a Friday night. Not too crowded, we got a table right away.  Our waitress was really cute and friendly. The pork shanks appetizer was amazing! It has a buffalo type sauce. I had the fris√©e and arugula salad which was okay. A bit small. Pumpkin bread pudding was delicious. The pickles that came with the burgers are a little odd.. I like a good ole dill pickle though. Overall good experience and would go back.

I love this place! Healthy, delicious, reasonably priced food. There is free parking behind the building too. I don't care too much for the sweet potato hash but everything else I've had is amazing. The beet salad is perfection.

The Alastian Tart was amazing and unlike anything I've ever had. Service was great. It's located near C13 in terminal 4.

Hidden speakeasy in the basement of the Renaissance hotel. The bar is cash only. They change the drink menu each weekend and once they run out of a drink they run out. It's a small place, the capacity is 49 people and they seem to strictly stick to that. I waited at least 30 min to get in. Chill atmosphere.
