Arrived at terminal C in this pretty clean and bright wing of the airport. Airport overall is pretty nice and efficient for TSA precheck. Walked right through security without issues. There's a Wendy's, Mexican place sit in and express and a farmer's market to go stand for breakfast.

Stopped by for a meal while Hunter is passed out at the house with my dad...amazing place!! The environment is very trendy and LA vibe...dark, good music, great atmosphere and really really tasty food!! Started with spicy margarita which was perfect, also tried the pomegranate margarita which was strong with a sweet taste...strawberry basil mojito tastes like a good tasting drink...then the food... Started with street corn which was simply amazing!! Then had the beef on a stick which was marinated perfectly...the guacamole is made table side and amazing...the pork belly was wonderful as well. The short rib was soft and amazing...but the fish tacos was not too good, not tender and little hard, but butternut squash taco was incredible!! Ordered too much food for 4...was stuffed after appetizers...

A must go if you are a boxing fan...TMT headquarters is no other place than in Chinatown Vegas!!! It is free to come in and watch the superstars and the next echelon of superstars in the sport!! If you are on vacation and have no gloves with you, just literally walk in, sit down in the one of the many ring side seats, and enjoy the training and hard work of the entire Mayweather organization that allows Money to talk like he does while backing up every last word. There is always Mayweather's family, whether its his uncle or his dad...but you can pick up plenty of tips to take back to your own home gym or just watch boxing at its finest...highly recommended!!! Kids and babies are present also...just FYI.

The tofu curry is just insane...the consistency of the flavor and cleanness and pureness of the batter is so amazing every time!!! This is one of our MUST GO PLACES every time we travel to Vegas!! This is even better than any curry places we have gone to in LA at Little Tokyo...its seriously that good!! You know some places have batter which tastes oily or gets worse throughout the day, there is zero salty or stale oil flavor here...actually there is zero oil flavor...the batter is so light and crisp day or night!! I also highly recommend their tofu salad, its so refreshing to your palate before you eat the Japanese curry...the pork is also super tender as well...there is really no going wrong but someone MUST get the tofu curry just so everyone can have a bite!!

Stopped by for dinner and in the mood for seafood so came here...first off I would recommend to sit on the bar side soley for the service of Erno, the bartender. He is here from Culver City by LA just to make the best drinks in town and provide excellent service here!! Extremely friendly staff!! We started with the bread with garlic/chive butter...not a big bread person but the crispy warm bread is hard to beat to start off a meal!! Then the cuttlefish appetizer was very tender with light crisp...then the date with bacon appetizer is excellent!! Sweet and good flavor!! Main course of lemon shrimp (good sized) and lobster ravioli (well done but not too much lobster taste), lump crab salad dinner (very sweet flavorful lump crab) and clams with pasta (perfect!!!! Not too heavy...light and clams extremely flavorful with perfectly made pasta). Boo room for desert!! Will come back again!!

Stopped by here for a in between meal after looking at some places in area and this is a wonderful environment!! Over 110 rum selection at the bar and a "lite menu" offered here with an amazing view!! Started with the calamari which was fried perfectly!! Then got the empanadas which had an amazing sauce that's spicy with it. Next was one of the best medium rare burgers I have ever had!! Must try!! Then got short rib nachos...would pass on that, short rib was a little well done and not tender and looked like a heart attack ready to happen...but the view was fantastic!!!!

Stopped by for quick breakfast as this was only place open outside of security...service was excellent!! The spicy chipotle egg sandwich was ok...not too spicy and croissant was soft. The breakfast with scrambled egg and ham and potato was ok as well. Egg wasn't very good as it was really clumpy but the ham was pretty good. Potatoes were so so, soft and not crispy at all...overall nothing too exciting but nothing else was open. Really 2.5 stars...only saving grace was the service...
