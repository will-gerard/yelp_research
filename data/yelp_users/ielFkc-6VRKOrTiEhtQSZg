This review is solely about volunteering here. They do not return phone calls or emails. They treat people that want to volunteer their time horribly! On facebook former volunteers/vanguards are always complaining. Sojourner Center should start treating better those willing to work for free! This is a disgrace. The horror stories that i heard and my personal experience of not even treated as a person that should have emails returned is just unbelievable. Want to volunteer? Look elsewhere.

I mispronouced something on the menu and I got an entire lecture about it complete with the mocking laugh. Sad cause i could have actually liked this place.   Word of advice: get rid of all the gimicky advertisements including the sign for the casino. Make it into a french cafe NOT a billboard in Times Square.

I ONLY shop at whole foods but this location is the worst of the 4 locations that I've been to in the valley. It might be the oldest so the layout and even selection seems to be outdated. I rather go to the location on mayo or even better go out of my way to the new location in camelback.

My local Home Depot. Aren't all Home Depot stores the same you wonder? They are not. This one exceeds every other Home Depot (and their competitor) locations that i have been to. If you are like me and love DIY products but need assistance in how to implement the idea in your head into real life this store is for you. No question is too stupid and everyone here is willing to help---judgment free.   -1 stars cause it is a bit pricier than some other chain home improvement stores.

They were good when they were gas carts. Now it is slow, the staff is rude and the management is ruder! Save your money and go bowling or something. You'll end up with more adrenaline than racing around in electric karts!

Bullying was really bad here when I attended. Everyone just turned a blind eye and allowed it to happen especially if the bullies came from a wealthier family than the Victims. In the end it was not about what the bullying was all about but they would take the side of the child whose family have the most money to give. Don't send your kids here. Public is probably better.

hands down the best sushi in the valley and some of the best that I had throughout the world. Who would have thought that from a little sushi shop in the desert?  Fresh fish flown in. Lots of non-sushi authentic dishes (try the Dynamite. You're welcome) and an impressive list of sake.

I went here after giving Danny's way too many second chances. Overall positive experience. Kinda wish that they explained their membership a bit more. I saw the sign and asked the cashier that had zero interest in letting me know about it. Sad cause it might have been something that I was interested in.

I don't see what all the hype is about. It's literally just an over priced house section of target, urban outfitters and world market.

Horrible service. Felt rushed. Gave us a check before we finished eating and before asking if we wanted anything.

I lived here from 2009-2010 and loved it! Great pool that is open 24/7 (and in the summer months a party 24/7). Only complaint is same as all others is that they do tow cars that don't have passes--like a friend visiting. Wish management can crack down on this.

The decor is really tacky but don't let that make you not want to try the Persian room.  I had the chicken kebabs and they were good. The best part of the meal though was the rice.  Servings are huge. I took the rest of mine to go and had lunch AND dinner the next day!

Rude! I work nearby and come ever so often and each and every time that staff has been extremely rude to me.   It could have easily been my favorite coffee shop in the area (I rather support a local business than a national chain) but at least when I go to a national chain I know i'm usually getting excellent service.

Never had something I didn't like. Veggie burgers and the breakfast pasta are my favorites. Does get very loud in the evenings which is not my liking (I'm getting old)

There was a misleading sale tag stating something with $0.00 when I brought it to the attention of Duane she was very rude, told me that she have to figure out the pricing and didn't even say thank you for bringing it to her attention even though by law I should be able to pay what on the price tag which meant it was zero aka free. I didn't like the item and had no plan on buying it but so did want to bring it to their attention and do the right thing. Instead I was treated without any dignity or respect and like I did something wrong! Talk about getting treated like shit for doing the right thing! See photo.

Before the raid this was the spot to get your at wash. Everybody worked really hard, car was always spotless and I never felt uncomfortable.  After the raid they hired a bunch of hoodlums. Many look like they just got out of prison and here we go giving them keys to our cars!    I am here now waiting for my car. The guy who took my car said "do you want to make the tires all pretty like you". Creepy!    Bring back the old workers or at least hire people that are respectful and professional!

Everyone that works here are super nice.   Great selection of wine, cheeses, baked goods.  Super kudos to the young woman (reddish chin-length hair, 5'4ish, slim) that always goes above and beyond to help when I'm in the store.

Best Indian food in Tempe and I tried most places. Friendly service, clean and when you ask for spicy they give you spicy unlike some other places where they determine the spice level it should be by your ethnicity.

I can no longer support this safeway. The manager (I think?--middle eastern guy in his 30s?) scolds at his employees in public. I don't know if they deserve it or not but pleAse keep it behind doors! A customer should not have to hear it. Also saw people protest near the store against this particular safeway because of how they treat employees (apparently not so well).

Do people still shop here? The quality of clothes went dramatically down hill (remember the see through pants? Then the problem with pilling!)   I don't think any of the employees that work here do yoga (other than the power yoga gym crap) so when you asking them for advice on how it would stand up in a real yoga (asana) class they can't even offer you advice!

The jungle curry rice bowl is absolutely delicious. Actually all of their rice bowls are great. Also love their tacos, veggie burger, sweet potato fries and all of their tropical drinks.

Very rude. Woman that I believe is the owner is very obnoxious and self-centered. You have to put up with constantly "I'm the best. Everyone wants to be like me. I'm so great people would pay double to be with me but I decline" does anyone actually believe that? It's pretty disturbing!  Anyway if you looking for a pet sitter that is not so wrapped up in how amazing she thinks she is (yet reviews everywhere shows a much different story) then continue looking.   Yelp does a good job hiding fake Reviews (such as those written by the owner under fake names) so the 12 positive reviews that yelp determine to be FAKE speaks volumes about the ethic of your business.

Yelp does a good job hiding fake Reviews (such as those written by the owner under fake names) so the 12 positive reviews that yelp determine to be FAKE speaks volumes about the ethic of your business.  The agencies you alleged to have won awards with are not "nationally acclaimed" but 3rd and even 4th tiered groups with ZERO CREDIBILITY.   If you don't believe me when I said that the owner is pretentious, snooty, egotistic then just read the laughable FAKE response to me by the owner.  And Nope not the guy that called. I identify as a cisgendered female.

This is solely for the clerk named Linda. She should be put in the back sorting mail and not out front "helping" customers because she is certainly lacking in customer service skills. She yells at, snaps at and disrespect customers. When one complains she goes in complete denial and victim blames. She one of those that feel she untouchable because she a government employee with seniority so she can treat someone like dirt and feels she can get away with it.    Linda was a very angry and sad person to me. Maybe I just caught her on her bad day but whatever the reason she should treat customers with good customer service not make them cry!  Hope the postal master is reading this and do try to fix this problem. Clearly I'm not the only one with a bad experience at this location!

A cheaper version of iPic. You get to choose your seat when you purchase your ticket. More comfy seating than your average theatre. A bar to enjoy a pre movie drink. The food is subpar. Think Applebee's quality. Other than that I always choose this theatre if they are showing a movie that I want to see.

MomDoc is the worse! I have been to several locations and not one deserve more than 1 star.  There is not any consistency. You have to repeat the same question with every person that you see during the same visit.  Very unprofessional.  The social media manager is an idiot that has difficulties expressing his/herself through writing.

Not a fan. I question their ingredients and ethics. The women working there are all extremely rude. Certainly lacking in customer service!

So I gave them another try. First thing I noticed was the depressed looks at the marginalized women faces that work there. Then the one "white boss" so to speak got up from her laptop and did not even say hello or ask if I have any questions (which I did!) I fended for myself, made the best attempt to educate myself and paid. Not a single thank you or even a smile. My heart ached for the women cutting up all the vegetables and hope that they are treated better than I was as a customer!  Why I am really writing this review for is the mess in the store! Boxes everywhere, a mess. Looks like a tornado ran right by it.  I know you're growing and this location probably doubles as the manufacturing plant but that's not an excuse to have a mess. Clearly a health violation!

This review is solely for the employee whose name tag read "syd the kid". On Friday she wore a purple headband.   She is by far the worst restaurant employee that I ever came across. My supervisor (my supervisor is well known aka a public figure I won't mention who she is) and I came in for a mid-morning break. We both ordered smoothies and we both had horrible experiences.  Syd the kid coughed into my cup while she was writing my name on the cup. I demanded a new cup and she was like "why do you want another cup" and I said cause you coughed into it. She rolled her eyes and got another cup.  At this time a few customers recognized my supervisor and was asking to take photos with her which held up the line. Finally supervisor ordered her drink. As the others who were starstrucked to see my supervisor went away someone behind the counter asked Syd the kid if she knew who that woman was. Syd the kid said "who knows. Probably a stripper". wrong Syd!  Why don't you read the news a bit more often before making a complete fool of yourself. Even sadder that she knew her name (for the cup) and she has a very unique name that even if you couldn't recognize her by face at least do so by name! Supervisor heard and had this look of disgust on her face. Great impression of old town she must have had!  We both had the piña-kale-Ada which was okay. Didn't taste organic.

Pricey for street tacos ($3 each--WTF??) but they are as good as you can get in Scottsdale.  I was actually quite surprise since I don't normally hold "2am drunk food in the club district" to high standards but these tacos are really good even when you are sober.   The chicken is my favorites.

How lovely, hate mail from the owner. After I posted my review i was sent hate mail from the owner. Even told me to try another juice store with a complete and utter attitude.  Everything I talked about bad customer service online and in person confirmed in that one email.

Only been here for breakfast but let me tell you this place is amazing! If you looking for a big plate, greasy breakfast to help with your hangover this is not the place for you. If you looking for a lighter, healthier meal to give you energy to start your day then go here!  They have a small, limited menu but don't let that turn you off. With a small menu they are able to perfect everything on it. I never left disappointed. The egg Benedict is one of the best that I ever tasted. I also love their breakfast sandwich.   I want to try their dinner options.

I am so happy that they moved closer to me. I've been a patron at their Central Ave location since forever but was always a pain to get to. I love their cocktails so to prevent any DUI it was always a $30 cab ride each way. No longer thanks to this new location!  The cocktails are good. The food is always delicious. I love the curry bowl, veggie burgers, tacos basically you can not go wrong with anything on the menu. Lots of vegetarian/vegan options.

The clothes themselves get 4 stars. The customer service -3 and that averages to 1 star.  I find the manager to be very incompetent. Whatever criteria she has to hire people has got to change. I never came across a group of employees that are so ignorant, mean, and lack common sense as I did with the staff at Athleta Scottsdale.   Oh and whoever is behind their social media pages is rude.  With four other athletic-wear stores in Kierland/scottsdale quarter they really need to step up their game to make it in this market.  If you are white, blonde and equally as clueless as the employees you probably would have a positive experience. I noticed that they bend over backward for some but ignore most especially ignore those with a brain!

I love Kate Spade. Love them even more that it's so deeply discounted. Bought a crossover purse for only $140.  Lots of discount stores in Arizona (such as Nordstrom Rack) do sell KS for around the same prices but you get a much bette selection at this outlet store.

Wow. Sorry I tried to help. The last thing I was expecting from a 3 star reviews (that pinpointed exactly what could be improved on) was being attacked, blamed and not believed by the owner (see comment by business owner below).  If you can't take constructive criticism well from your own REPEAT customers then how can I feel confident that next time I visit your business that I would have more than .0002 seconds to look over the menu or I won't have to eat watching an employee using her cell phone (that I doubt she washes every times she uses it) in the front of the house. If that is going on in the front then I don't want to know what nastiness if happening in the back?  Blaming a customer that requested time to actually be fully in the store before asking what she wants is completely unacceptable.  So Business Owner let go of your ego, stop attacking customers that give three stars and perhaps listen to us.  I won't ever go back. I have updated my review to a one star because of the ill response I received from the owner.  I'll go spend my money where my concerns or suggestions are appreciated.
