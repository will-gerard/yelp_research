If you want some authentic Mexican, this is THE place to go in Madison. I was incredibly impressed by the lengua and chorizo tacos, and the "mi mexico" platter is a great value for $10, giving you a BIG portion of flank steak, grilled nopales, beans, and peppers! I didn't have a chance to try the tortas or huaraches, but watching them cook up on the flattop grill was awesome.  Two warnings:   1) This is a converted row house, so there isn't that much seating. There's a couple of small tables and a big countertop / bar that runs around the grill.  2) When they're really going and have all of the gas stoves and grills going, you get a very distinct whiff of gas in the place. It didn't bother me too much, but some people may not like that.

What a beautiful building for a hockey game.   After attending the 2012 NHL draft at CONSOL, I was impressed by the layout of the building, the quality of the facilities, and the excellent sight lines from all over the arena.  My only complaint is parking - there really isn't any - but that's more a problem with Pittsburgh itself than the arena.

This was an awesome site to go walking while on breaks from work in the area. The foot trails running along the lake are beautiful, and taking a walk over to the bike / walking paths gives you a great workout through a bunch of scenery along the river. A lovely resource that I wish more people were taking advantage of - I hardly saw anyone there over a three day stay!

I wish I could tell you what Barrio Cafe is like, but my experience wasn't very helpful.  While traveling, I was at Sky Harbor for a layover between flights and wanted to get some lunch. Barrio Cafe was right next to my gate, so I decided to go for it even though the prices were a little high.  I was seated quickly next to an older couple, and shortly after I was settling into my seat they had an appetizer delivered. I asked them what it was, because it looked quite good, and found out it was the tecate breaded fish and shrimp. I was tempted to grab it for a meal, and thanked them for letting me know.  I perused the menu. No server came by.  I plugged in my phone at the A/C outlet next to the table. No server came by.  The couple next to me finished their meal. No server came by.  The couple requested their check and their waiter dropped it off, then turned and walked away. No server asked if I had been helped.  The couple next to me paid their check and asked "Has anyone even gotten you a drink yet?"  I checked my watch. It had been 15 minutes since I was seated, and I had 20 minutes before my flight was supposed to start boarding.   I stood up to leave. The waiter who had come by to collect the check from the couple next to me asked how my meal was. I told him I didn't know, since no-one had ever taken my order.  He asked if I wanted to sit back down. I explained to him that I was concerned about missing my connecting flight, and that I really just wanted to get some lunch  quickly.  Instead of letting me go, he gave me a rather nasty look and said "Well, if THAT'S the way you feel, SIR, maybe you /should/ go somewhere else."  I'm very, very glad I didn't give them my money, and if I'm going through Sky Harbor again, I don't intend to ever return.
