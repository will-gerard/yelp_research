What to order: the shredded beef tacos (which is what earns the 4 stars).  I'm a huge fan, my mouth occasionally waters thinking about them (like now).  This is a great spot for cheap authentic Mexican to go food.  This review is more for my friends.  If you're hanging around Roosevelt or Co+Hoots, there is a great easy place to take-out from right in the hood.  Nothing about the overall experience jumps out at me, dining-in sitting in the straight back chairs isn't recommended.  They don't speak much English and the local Mexican families do eat there - so you know it is good and authentic!!!

I just was asked by a friend where he should have his Volvo repaired, and I remembered Volvo Am I and how much care they gave my beloved 240 wagon.  What you're paying for by choosing these guys is legit expertise, so it's worth it.  They  seemed reasonable on the price factor anyway.  The owner clearly loves Volvos and used to have a really neat 1800 out front.

YOU HAD ONE JOB and you screwed it up and you screwed up the opportunity to correct it.   Forget this place. It's a mess. They overfilled my oil and caused a bunch of potential damage wasting hours of my time - then they promised to refund me and that I'd be contacted by a customer service rep and that never happened despite my own followups (been 6 days). I don't give bad reviews. I made a special effort to come on Yelp and toss my middle finger at this place. Save yourself and go elsewhere!

Dr Wyatt's practice eclipses anything I've found in this town.  ALL of his staff I've encountered have been very sweet, while being honest and direct and LISTENING to my concerns and very patiently talking through all my questions.    I'm sure I'm not alone in being freaked out by people doing things in my mouth.  I have had special fears in this area, and they were very gracious in helping me get through it.  I've been back twice, once for a filling and just recently for a difficult wisdom tooth extraction.  I felt like I was expertly cared for through the entire experience - I have literally been putting this off for years because no one else did that for me.  It doesn't show how much I dislike the medical care I've found in Phoenix in general based on my Yelp reviews because I'm usually so annoyed, astounded or afraid to write something I will regret later that I just don't write.  So it's my great pleasure to recommend Dr Wyatt and his staff.  One other side note on the character of the Doc -on my last visit I found out that he recently donated several months of his time traveling overseas performing dental care in the 3rd world.  Bravo.

I love pleasant surprises.  I have to confess, I made fun of this place driving by one time because it looks like a total dive.  I was kind of shocked to get a recommendation from Helen of Sweet Republic Ice cream... if she said it was going to be good, I knew it would be... and it was!  This was a delight.  The wait staff spoke nearly no english (making it even more authentic?), but they were super sweet and went way out of their way to make it great.  I'm still warming up to Dim Sum, so this time we tried some more low key dishes, Sesame Chicken (WOW!) and Chicken Broccoli.  The flavors in the sesame sauce was great, just the right thing for a Tuesday night.  Massive portions. Chow mein as well as rice. Can't wait to go back.  I didn't attempt to verify, but I'm fairly certain there was no MSG. Everything tasted VERY fresh.

I'm so glad to see this 'place' on yelp!  It's a hidden gem you can only get on the weekend evenings.  It's conveniently directly across from the LightRail stop @ Camelback and 7th Ave.    It's basic menu makes it easy to choose something good after many hours of drinking.  Especially if you aren't sure if you intentionally or inadvertently ended up inside Charlie's and line danced with gay men in cowboy hats all night.  Also I love their Horchata (Cinnamon Rice Milk) - it's especially wonderful on a hot Arizona night.

This place is run by a guy named Russ - he is extremely skilled.  Over the duration of hanging out watching him work, I witnessed people entrusting him with classic cars to euro tuners - doing specialty stuff.  He has a great eye and works fast, and has a high emphasis on quality.   You just have to realize it's basically a one-man shop so you won't get pampered (haha more like ripped off @ M*das) like at a big commercial shop, and he is a busy guy so he doesn't have a lot of time to talk, but what you miss out on in a fancy waiting room, you more than make up with quality.  Also my BMW sounds badass now!

The menu is interesting - kicks right off with Goat Curry - I dare you to try it (i was too chicken, i mean i ordered curry chicken instead). It's colorful and cute.  The food was OK.  I would say that it will get better once they are doing higher volume, it was obviously not prepared immediately before we were served (most of these foods do stew all day anyway in all fairness) but it wasn't served piping hot.   I couldn't tell if the rice was supposed to have a smokey flavor. (probably?)  The plantains were yummy.    I'm really torn on the rating for this one.  The ladies that run the place are charming and they are clearly in startup mode.  I WANT to be a huge fan of this place, but not yet.   But if it's near your hood definitely check it out! I couldn't help constantly comparing it in my mind to Havana Cafe-and I think for the price and overall experience and exquisite flavors they've got em beat right now.  3 1/2 stars if there was that rating.
