Impeccable service, but what else would you expect at the Ritz-Carlton?! Stopped in for a late night dessert with the boy after a sad, failed attempt to make homemade pizza. They were happy to accommodate us even though it was pretty close to closing time. It was a gorgeous evening so we got a table outside, what an adorable Parisian patio! Our server was very professional and sweet, offering tons of variations of lattes and cappuccinos that she could whip up for me after I mentioned craving coffee! I ordered the vanilla creme brulee w. mixed berries on top & he got chocolate cake. Both were divine and definitely made us forget about all of the trauma that our taste buds had suffered!

Stepping foot into LGO makes me want to move to the Arcadia area immediately! It is absolute madness inside, filled with Lululemon clad young professionals, the smell of yummy breakfast in the air (perhaps with a hint of Michael Kors "Very Hollywood" ;)), smiles from all of the employees, and super cute season appropriate trinkets.   Every time I have gone it has been PACKED, but so worth the wait! A friend & I went on a Sunday morning after an intense bootcamp session to refuel with egg white omelettes, mine with avacado, hers with Veggies. Perfect AM protein fix! I've only been for breakfast, but I am dying to hit the pizzeria for dinner. Absolutely darling.

Okay, it's official... I'm dropping out of Journalism school & opening a cafe! I fell head over heels in love with this little gem back in April when my mom&I stopped in for coffee on her birthday. I'm a total Starbucks junkie (Gold Card holder since 2010, baby!) and frequent it on the daily, so I really am skeptical when it comes to getting my caffeine fix anywhere else. However it is safe to say that The Coffee Shop makes the BEST dang chai that has ever graced my perfectly glossed lips, Y-U-M! But the loveliness sure didn't stop there. I couldn't believe my eyes as we walked outside to a patio enveloped in a gorgeous rose garden!   I took my mom back for Mother's Day & one of the adorable waitresses told me it was supposed to be the busiest day of the year. There were 15+ guests in front of me in line, but of course I was willing to wait. I ordered skinny soy caramel macchiatos for the two of us, as well as a strawberry scone & blueberry white chocolate coffee cake. My mom loved her pastry (the coffee cake) but my strawberry scone was really salty :( I'm positive that it was just a recipe fluke because of the Mother's Day insanity, and a little salty scone will not stop me from a 5 star review!

I daydream about spandex. Lululemon spandex, in particular! I could not be more obsessed with their perfect gym/yoga/just hangin' out attire. It's everything that I look for: soft, well-made, move&grooveable, and above all their pants make your booty look like a million bucks! I have a few pairs of their crops, am a HUGE fan of their tanks, and have received more compliments on my ruffle dance jacket than probably any other piece of clothing that I own!  The staff at this location is OUTSTANDING!!! The SQ staff is pretty fab, but could definitely use a few tips from these ladies ;) They always go above and beyond to help you find exactly what you need. Last time I stopped in one of the girls even tried a tank on for me so that I could see what it looked like off the hanger without messing up my hair! Ha! Amazing. Not to mention Lululemon hosts incredible events, like sunset poolside yoga at The W every Thursday in May! Literally can't live without Lulu.

You HAVE to go see Brittany Rea at 20 Lounge! She is my go-to girl for fab nails. It is such a cute boutique-esque salon with a chic mani bar, and comfy pedicure thrones. They also offer complimentary champagne during your services! Mama loves her bubbly, but I usually opt for the yummy passion fruit iced tea that Wildflower Bread Co. has next door :)  My first service here was a gold rockstar gel mani, which was "so so." The tech was sweet, precise, and fabulous, but it just wasn't as SPARKLY as glitter gels that I've had at other places! I was happy to get 20% off of my service for being a new customer.  Last week I made an appointment with Brittany and got the new Shellac polish! I am officially obsessed... I got "Romantique" which is a super light pink/tan looking color & it looks GORGEOUS! I was a bit apprehensive to see how it would hold up, because it's not as thick as gel polish so I thought it might chip, but it still looks fresh after 7+ days! Love, love, love it. I will definitely be back!

Beach Bunny is perfect for glamazon girls who love bringing bling to the beach! A celeb favorite as well as a major staple in the Sport's Illustrated Swimsuit Issue each year, their bikinis, lounge wear, and beach accessories are of impeccable quality and each piece is absolutely darling! I typically shop online for BB, but decided to stop in the boutique on Stetson a few months ago before my Spring Break trip to CA. The associate was such a doll and helped me pick out the cutest bikinis that matched my style, told me about all of the sales & didn't hesitate to order a bottom in my size that they didn't have in the store. I ended up purchasing one of their signature Swarovski crystal braided headbands in tan, and a pair of sparkly Swarovski crystal sandals as well :) In AZ/CA where bikini season is all year long, I hope to stay adorned in Beach Bunny 12 months out of the year!   PS. The ladies behind Beach Bunny ended up Tweeting me after my shopping experience wishing me a fun trip & thanking me for stopping in! Love that. Can't wait for the Scottsdale Quarter location to be unveiled!

iPic has a funny way of making a Box Office SMASH seem like the best movie of the year! Mi amor&I went to check out this new hot spot several months ago and bought tickets for *insert sub par Vince Vaughn movie here.* Checked in for our reservation at the front desk and proceeded to the snack bar. What's a movie without yummy snacks, right?! The wine dispensary is a nice touch, but I went with a Sugar-Free Red Bull. Oh, and chocolate covered strawberries?! Don't mind if I do!   The whole place is absolutely stunning, however the BATHROOM is amazing! It has an Old Hollywood glamour feel that reminds me of what Marilyn Monroe's powder room might have looked like! The big leather seats reduce cuddle factor, but are super comfy. It's kind of close quarters & at times I worried that my feet were too close to the person in front of me, but hopefully that's a little glitch they can fix in iPic Phase II :) Overall this theater is divine & gives all other wannabe luxury theaters a run for their money!

I truly anticipated that Barrio Queen would become one of my favorite restaurants upon walking in. Awesome decor and concept with the taco menu resembling a sushi menu where you mark off which you'd like to try. Then we met the waitress & it all went downhill from there... Just the thought of this place makes me sick now!  I ordered a martini & after tasting it, my entire table of avid tequila drinkers decided that there was tequila in it. No big deal, we'll just order another one, right?! Wrong. The waitress was so rude and sarcastic stating that there was NO tequila in it, in fact she made it herself. Okay?   Ordered a round of tacos, they were fine. Nothing inspiring. Ordered tableside guac, they didn't make it tableside for us but they did for a nearby table. Chips WAY too greasy. We were still hungry so we ordered chicken enchiladas. They were cold, disgusting, and here's the kicker... I found a long dark hair right in the middle... VOM! We were clearly done at that point, and when we politely showed the waitress the hair she says, "That's so weird, I don't think there's anyone who even works here with long dark hair..." Hahahahaha! At a mexican restaurant?! *Cue 5 different employees walking by our table with long dark hair before we leave* Laughable. She didn't apologize or comp anything for us. Had she done that, I might have tried Barrio Queen again and given it a second chance but since the service was so incredibly poor and the food totally subpar I won't ever waste my time again! If you want amazing mexican food try La Hacienda at The Princess or The Mission.
