Post workout shake advertises 54g protein yet the shake only contains one "baby" scoop. Which protein contains 54g? If they can present this to me I will purchase it.

Hidden location, but when discovered you are guaranteed to return. Taste of Mexico in Tempe, AZ.

Try the big Juan! This is the staple burger of ASU. Don't let the shack like appearance of the restaurant fool you!

Unknowingly, I drive past this establishment regularly on my trips down Scottsdale Rd. The signage is a bit weak from the road making it hard to find.  Upon arriving my party was immediately greeted and seated. Our server Jenine was very helpful in explaining the menu to my party.  The food did take a bit to come, but was well worth the wait. We started with the breakfast nachos. Quite a unique combination of chorizo, eggs, and cheese over chips.  I will be returning

Friendly staff who were more than willing to explain every menu item. A little disappointed in the extra charge for guac....what is this? Communist Russia?

My bartender Austin fully explained the menu. I ended up trying the the fajita combo! Great presentation and taste; although it is a bit pricy. This may become a regular lunch spot for me.

This is hands down the worst service I have ever encountered.   Our server took a few minutes before greeting our table. She was hesitant to answer any question the menu; telling us,"I will be back in a minute." After 10 minutes of waiting my party decided to leave.   The venue has a total of 12 patrons   Will NEVER return

The long line normally scares me away from this location. However, it is hard to choose a different spot which caters to a healthy lifestyle.  I had the chicken teriyaki bowl. This was an item I had not previously noticed on their menu. The combination of meat and vegetables, coupled with a sweet and savory sauce, was perfect for my palate.  This experience was far better than what I have experienced at other locations.

The bar vibe makes you feel like you could walk out onto a beach. Coupled with their burritos this place is great!

The Ramen was delicious. Made from fresh ingredients with a slow cooked stocked. There were a few problems I encountered. I was greatly disappointed by the false advertising of their sumo challenge. I was promised a free meal a week upon completion. Look for my name on the wall and you will see it posted as the champion. However, when attempting to receive my prize I was told it was a "joke". I will be hesitant to give them business again.

Loved the foos-ball tables with attached table taps. Tried the picnic chicken slider and loved the fresh taste of the chicken and bun. I will definitely be back again on a weekend night.

$20 for bruschetta and wine! This is a deal you can't beat! Make sure to call in and make a reservation because the wait usually is over an hour.

Out of the ordinary sandwiches. Large menu display on the door and above the register. Great sandwich, but a bit pricy for the amount of meat included.

Felt like I had stepped into an east coast beach bar. The ambiance was fantastic.  We were seated and never greeted by a server for a drink order. After flagging down a server we were fully enlightened on their specialty cocktail menu. I ordered a "spark plug" which contained cold brewed coffee, vanilla vodka, Malibu, and a coffee ice cube. This was a fantastic drink.  In term of food I will never eat here again. The chicken in my cauliflower fried rice was tough and rubbery. It tasted as if it has been pre boiled then placed on the grill for marks  This may have just been this item, but I will be hesitant to eat here again

This restaurant is a beautiful addition to mill. Upon entry there is a breathtaking flag mural and collection of cool shirts/hats for sale. Immediately upon entry we were greeted with smiles.  They seated us in a large camo booth. Our server Corrine was quick to introduce herself and offer drinks and menu descriptions. I ordered the chicken and waffles. BEST ITEM EVER!!!!! Sweet honey sauce on top...  I will return to check out their nightlife.
