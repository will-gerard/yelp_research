Called about 5 minutes ago to see about getting some headphones, guy answered and was polite up until I told him I would be right in to check out what they had. He abruptly cut me off and said he would only be there for a few more minutes. Apparently their hours are incorrect and they are not open until eight but instead six. I asked why there was a discrepancy and he hung up on me... Okay fine ill go to guitar center. Tried supporting a local business, not worth it these guys are rude.

Awesome spot with great food and a huge dog friendly patio! The wings, bruschetta and pretzel bites are all great appetizers to start with. The deluxe mac & cheese is my favorite for dinner!

Finally after extensive searching I have found my favorite Mediterranean place! It has a very local feel and the staff is friendly. The food has ALWAYS come out fresh, sometimes I can't believe how amazing their fruits and vegetables are. I would come here just to get some of their perfectly ripe tomatoes, something I am very particular about. The gyro wrap and the beef entree are my go to choices, however everything else I have tried has been incredible. Highly recommended.

This venue is dying, dirty, high drink prices. Only thing that saves it is the location.

Hands down the best screen repair in the business. These guys changed my screen even though my iPhone 5s, unknown to me, was filled with hot glue from a previous repair. They took the time to remove the glue and had my phone up and running again in 15minutes. Would highly recommend bringing your phone here for any screen repair. DO NOT GO TO APPLE.

I had a difficult (also very expensive) RBA that I could not get to work, however I wasn't quite ready to give up on it. I came in late Sunday around 5:00, Jake was working and he said he would rebuild the coils for me while I went and got a bite to eat. When I got back he showed me everything wrong with the RBA and even saved the coils I had built for it; all at NO charge! I ended up buying a new battery and was very satisfied with the customer service. Jake definitely made this my go to vape shop/ lounge and I highly recommend it for both experienced and novice vapers.
