they return the clothes wet, the service is  quick and go that they don't dry the garments, just hang them  wet in the plastic wrap, by the time you place them in your closet they get smelly bad chemicals ,smell like dirty laundry. and they ruin my suede blazer they employee  don't read the  tags, because you pay cheap everything gets the same  wash.

the bar tenders are thief's (the girls )  on the roof top patio they auto tip them self's stealing your money ,and change the price of the drink at any time , like those PBR $5 bucks at any giving time  or the mix drinks specials. they are not honest and don't give a fuck about you just the money.  best way to do it is buy 3 drinks at same time and tip them a dollar once, they need to learn this cheap bitches.

The best way to go Alcoholic. huge store you will turn alcoholic you will wanna try every single bottle in the store cuz you probably never hear of that brand before. the 6 pack beer are cheap example domestics beer 6 pack $4.99. and the and dont worry for those weird delicious beer you never seen before you can buy them in singles around $1 each and try them . this is the best place to go with a friend on a friday evening save money before hit the $$$ bar.
