Never, ever go here.  I bought a groupon for laser hair removal for my girlfriend, who had been looking at other places to try. They booked her WAY out (very few open apts?), upsold her on more areas but failed to tell her they couldn't do the areas around her tattoos (still took her money for those areas tho), didn't return phone calls with questions, scheduled 6 weeks between apts, and had her show up twice when they closed early. These people are unprofessional. Look elsewhere.

I'm not one for trying every new coffee shop that pops up, but it was convenient to pop in and check this pace out. The ambiance is nice, though a bit sparse, and they have the typical "art" on the walls and mandatory performance space. The reason I've giving four stars is because I don't like to order on-the-menu, and the woman was very receptive to my questions and requests. At Starbucks I'll get a look of frustration as the baristas try to figure out how to type my order into their registers and charge me for it, but this woman simply listened, put something in, and asked me questions as she made the drink. It made it feel like she was truly customizing it to my tastes.  I guess if I'd used the drive-thru or simply ordered a drink from the menu I might have a more generic or bad experience, but this was one time that watching and explaining what I liked truly paid off for me.
