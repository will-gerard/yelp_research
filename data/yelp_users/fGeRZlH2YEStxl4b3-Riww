When I go through nasty fights with a girlfriend, I go get a half of chicken salad and a works steak to make myself feel better! Its that kind of place for me! Joe and his family have been operating this place for all of the 32 years I have been here in Scottsdale. My sister and I would spend babysitting money on a pizza hogie once a week every summer. Great family, great food, great place. No frills interior, old school the whole way but perfect.

Levi was as good as it gets. Very professional. Went above and beyond, I would recommend him to all of my colleagues! Arrived on time and had the job done in minutes. His prices were super fair and I will absolutely be using him again!

I had trouble getting professional responses from the couple who operate this company. The quote I received was not the price I was charged. I made sure to pack the unit very carefully because of the fact the units are loaded onto a truck. When I first entered the unit at the facility several things were tossed inside of the unit. When I had the unit delivered to my new residence the driver was not careful about unloading the unit again. It probably took him no more than five minutes and when tilting the unit it was very jerky. You could hear things inside moving around. Would not recommend.

This is the second time I have used this particular location. Jenny and her staff have been more than helpful. The prices are competitive,  the facility is safe and secure. They also offer a complimentary truck to use for moving items in and out of your unit. A very personable staff! Would recommend to anyone!
