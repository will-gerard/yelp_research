I love this place and order from here all the time! I love the owner and she is the sweetest thing ever. She remembers things about my family and always gives him the cookies he loves. Mings is old school and the atmosphere is very family friendly. I always get the shrimp lo mein and have never been disappointed!

Like this place because it's always clean and they only have big washers and you only have to run the dryer one time (often times that's too much heat). Free WiFi too, so I can get homework done at the same time. They also have tv's with sports games on and the staff are always friendly.

I always love coming here. Everything has always worked fine for me and my car is always clean when I leave here. Just wish the air fresheners actually would last more than two days! I can't see paying $14.95 for a monthly car wash fee but hey if you have the money and you wash your car more than once a month I guess it COULD be worth it.

To me this place wasn't that great. I ordered a two piece catfish and the batter was super thick, staff were inattentive and no where to be found. It seemed pretty popular as the parking lot was full. I didn't even eat half my meal before I got a little disgusted for spending the money and hopped up to toss the mess in the trash. I'll pass and stick to Pete's Fish and Chips!

This place is off da chain!!! Love it, it's my close go to besides hauling across town to go to LoLo's. I did not think this place could compare by looking at the outside but I surely was wrong. I got the two piece dinner and before I could take pictures of my meal it was gone! Luckily, there is always tomorrow. This place is a definite must try.

Love this place but they are a little overpriced!!! The sauce is what makes the chicken taste even better! Raising canes is fab. 4 stars due to prices!

I really enjoyed the food! Ordered the Pad Thai (medium) and it was pretty hot anything beyond medium and I wouldn't be able to taste my food.  They played soothing music that made me want to get a massage. The reason for the four rating and not five is due to following:  After getting our food we were not acknowledged nor were our drinks filled. They past by several times and we tried to grab their attention and they kept walking by. After finishing our food they did not come to our table for about 15 minutes.   Other than that everything was good jus lacking on the service side.

I'm not sure what they do but this place is AMAZING! I am an avid sushi eater and believe you me when I noticed this place, I assumed there is no way it can be that good! I mean who eats sushi out of the mall and one of the worst malls in Phoenix if that. I'm telling you that you have to try it! The owner is super friendly and their prices are spectacular. I was full after one roll...less than $6. Love it, they have a loyal customer!

I think this place is great. Although it takes a lil time because it is made upon ordering it's more authentic than Breadfruit! Full bar is an added plus and the Caribbean drinks are delish. It's in central phoenix which is a plus and Wi-Fi is an added bonus. They sell island souvenirs and Rastafarian items. They even have live jazz on the weekends! Can't complain as they are still working out the kinks since they opened up last Monday. They are definitely in the right track!
