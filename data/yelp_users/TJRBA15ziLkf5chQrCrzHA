I was not impressed.  We were here with a group of friends and the staff didn't seem to care if they waited on us or not.  When our server did come around, he was friendly and seemed to enjoy what he was doing, but honestly, I've had better service at other places

I can't believe the the Bourbon Hamburger can not be ordered without mushrooms, unless of course you also leave off the onions and peppers.  as I despise mushrooms, I did just that and ended up with a rather dry and tasteless hamburger.  I was very disappointed to say the least.

I followed Brittany here so I could continue to get great hair care services.  Once again I was NOT dissapointed.  The location it's self was easy to find, well taken care of and clean.  While I did not interact with many other employees here, those I did talk to were also very nice.

It's kind of hard to rate a Cemetery don't you think?  Anyway, as we have a family member buried here out treatment was top notch.  Those that helped us during the ceremony was not only a veteren, but held other veterns to the highest Honor, regardless of the branch they served in.  It's sad to have to visit a place such as these, but it's nice to see that it is very well maintained and those intered there are Honored.

As I don't visit many Cigar Stores, I have to say that the staff here is very knowledgeable about their products.  They take the time to educate you and answer all your questions.  You see people from all walks of life coming in to get what they are looking for in a fine Cigar.

This place is BOMB-DIGGITY!!!!!!!!!!!!    My wife found this location while we were looking for thier competator and I'm glad she did.  I prefer Blimpies so much more that they other guys.  The bread is just the way I like it, soft.    The brothers that own and operate this location are great, they remember you and what you like as does thier staff.    We look forward to eating here everytime we get the chance.

From the time we walked into the door the staff was friendly and considerate.  After checking in we were offered water or soda and shown the location of the bathroom.   The lawyers we meet with were very professional, upfront and pleasant.

I just made my last trip to this Brand.  After 4 months of having my nails done every two weeks and a pedicure about every 6 weeks, I will no longer patronize this brand at either of their locations.    The reason?  This afternoon I went in for my fill and after things were started I noticed the nail clippings from the previous customer on the towel covering the work station.  I was grossed out.  Then I felt goo on my forearm near my elbow from a previous customer.  Needless to say I am way more than unhappy with today's experience.  Whats worse, is that the customer after me, was put through the same thing as I did not see the towel changed, cleaned or anything.  This is disgusting and I won't be back.

Lets just say when a customer walks in, your personal conversation needs to come to an end.  Sadly the Reps in the cell phone department didn't do that, and didn't offer any assistance until after I said Lets go.  When we asked about a specific phone, they had no idea what we were talking about so we had to leave anyway.  No wonder they are going out of business, it's more of a playtime for the employee's as apposed to a work place.

I don't get to dine her often but that is not because I don't want to.  This is a great place for some very unique burgers with a great twist.  The staff has always been very friendly and the food well prepared.    While I normally get the blue cheese burger, my last visit I changed it up bit.  I was a bit disappointed as I didn't get much blue cheese on my burger.  I'll try it again and hopefully next time there will be more.

We stopped by after a unexpected dental procedure for my wife as she wanted something soft to eat and pancakes filled the bill.  The food was O.K. but our server seemed more interested in us getting leaving.  She took our order and delievered our food with no problem, then she presented us with our check without even asking if we wanted anything more.  I was thinking about some desert, but with the "hurry up and leave" attitude, I wasn't going to bother her.  The sad thing is, they were not busy and I would have thought that she'd been upselling everything so that she could increase her tip.

I've only been here a couple of times and I'm not planning on going back due the the rudeness at the front desk.  Make an appointment, don't waste your time, it won't matter.  If you need assistance or the use of a wheelchair, better have your own, they do NOT provide anything like that at all.

We walked out.  There was no reason for the poor service we got this evening.  As there were very few people there, lots of open seats were available.  We were seated by the bus boy as soon as we got there.  Then we waited.  When everyone else is already eating 2 minutes is to long to make a table wait.  We left.  My wife spoke out about how this was her 2nd horrible experiace at this location in as many weeks.  Tonight she was feed b.s., l's and e's about how there was a credit card issue.  To us it looked as if our server was just goofing off not really caring if he waited on anyone or not.  Good luck with dinner service here, We've never had this experiace during breakfast, so it'll stay a breakfast place, maybe lunch, but no more dinners.

I read other reviews about the customer service being very poor.  Our experiance was just the opposite.  We visited late in the evening, close to closing time, and there was no pressure for us to leave and come back.  As our visit was after an already long day, I was in a bit of a "punchy" mood and they took my ribbing well even listed my wife as "money penny" on thier little electronic waiting list thing a ma

I'm not a big fan of this brand.  The few locations I've been to have been staffed with way less than friendly people and if you're looking for clothing, theirs sucks, as far as I'm concerned.  I can't I'd buy much from this brand except for household items and if I need those, there are others store much closer for me to go to.

The Mesa Mart is a great place to great to exercise and shop at the same time.  With 4 rows of shops to explore you can find just about everything you are looking for.    Don't let the size scare you.  You'll have to explore each row on it's own to get the full depth of the items being offered. While you will see multiple booths on different rows offering the same items, you'll also find unique vendors mixed in offering items you won't find anywhere else.    This is a great place to get a truly "one of a kind" gift.  Most often you'll be talking directly with the craftsman that makes the product you are interested in.  Interested in information, there are numerous booths that offer information from windows, water softeners to patio makeovers, swimming pools and hot tubs.     If you are worried about the weather, The Vendors are all covered and while the outside might look a little "gloomy" the inside is full of bright and cheerful patrons and vendors.    Give it a try, you have nothing to loose but some calories.

Like Home Depot this is a toy store for big boys.  While they have much the same as any other hardware store, some items are different brands. The staff was very friendly making our trip very pleasent.

I had a cover up done by Tami and it turned out awesome.  Instead of just slapping something on me and going to work, Tami drew out the design over my old tattoo so the  Cover up would do what it needed to do.  The quality of the finished job is great, in fact my wife commented that Tami did just as good of a job as they do on the show "tattoo nightmares".  I'm sure I'll be getting more and I'll definitely ask for Tami.

Thier driver must think they own the road.    As I was driving home this moring, a white ford panel van cut in front of me without signalling then got around another car and cut in front of them.  A silly thing to do with the company name plastered all over the place.  I called the company directly, but it went to voicemail.  I wonder if they'll return my phone call?

I've never shied away from this brand but it wasn't a go to place until recently.  I find myself really enjoying their salad as well as their entree's.  For the most part the service is prompt and friendly, allowing my wife and I to have an enjoyable time no matter what the occasion.

They do NOT match their on-line prices, I was NOT impressed.  I reserved a book on-line for my daughter and since I dropped my wife off at work across the street from this location I waited the 30 minutes I had to for them to open.  That was my choice and no big deal, what was a big deal was the attitude when I got inside.  I went the customer service counter to get the book I reserved and was told that it was at the checkout counter, I go the the checkout counter and when it couldn't be found, and I explained that I had just reserved this morning, the sales lady got rather rude and asked if I had gotten an e-mail that it was ready.  I was then advised that it was at customer service.  I explained that I was at customer service and was told it was supposed to be there.  So with continued rudeness I was told that since I had just reserved it on-line, it was still at customer service desk as they had not had time to bring it to the front.  Wow, it must have been my fault for reserving it on line and arriving to soon after-wards to get it.  I asked about the $2.00 difference in price and was told they do not match on line prices.  The "excuse" I was given was their "overhead" was higher.  I was born at night, but it wasn't last night and I do not for a minute by that line of B.S.  For for these reasons, I'll buy either second hand books or from independent book stores.  I'm tired of corporate America's attitude that I'm here for the sole purpose of giving them my money to make them even richer.

This was my first and most likely last time I visit this chain.  The reason, there was nothing special about this visit and lots of room for improvement.  Neither the menu, service or management was above mediocre.  Part of the problem is my fault.  What can I say, I never would have expected a Deli to serve PIZZA'S  I mean really, a pizza from a deli.  I thought I was ordering a 14 sandwich, when in fact I ordered a pizza, from a Deli.    When the order was brought out I was kind-of shocked that I had 2 pizza's.  I ordered what I thought was a small sandwich for my wife.  The young man that brought out the food called the manager over, who then began to inform me that I ordered a 14", yep, you got it Pizza.  When I told him I thought I ordered a sub, he was rather rude in stating "we don't sell subs here".  No offer to remake the order, he just had to prove he was correct and I was wrong.  Where's Willy Degal when you need him.    So since I had paid for the order and since it was my fault, I accepted defeat and left with my pizza's.    Sadly, the pizza's weren't really that good either.  I've never had a sourdough pizza crust, until now, and even though it was light and airy, I couldn't taste any sourdough.    So all in all, an epic fail on every aspect of my visit here.  I'm hoping that the chain and the stores do well, but it will be without my help.

First and foremost, it's a fast food hamburger joint.  It does have some very interesting items on the menu and so far the only place I've found that offers Jalapeno's.  I like the fact that they bring the meal to your table, which beats standing around crowding the counter while they cook it.  I'm not quite sure why they bring the little tray with the condiments and napkins as well.  Is it cost control or just they way they do it.  Anyway, It's not like the others in many ways and should not be confused with any of the huge national brands.  They are unique and should stay that way.

Dr. Sotelo is a Buckeye's fan, how can you go wrong here?    Beside being from the same area in the Midwest as Dr. Sotelo I have been taking our children here for several years.  We have always been treated well by the staff and Dr. Sotelo.  There is hardly any issues with scheduling an appointment and they don't make you wait forever in the waiting room or the exam room.  I saw Dr. Cannon for the firstime on my last visit there and was pleased with his evaluation and treatment of my daughters issues.

It's sad to say that I wasn't very impressed.  While the meal my wife had, grilled chicken, was moist and very tasty, my meal, a 28 day aged New York Strip had a lot to be desired.  First it was over cooked, I ordered Medium, it came out Medium Well.  The second time it was only 2 steps past Rare.  I didn't send it back a second time due to wanting to get home and put an end to this bad experience.  The other issue I had was seasoning, as there was none, no salt, no pepper, nothing.    Although my food was less than desirable, the server was very pleasant.  I'm not sure I'll be back but if I do return, steak will not be on my most desired list.

It was great.  After a long day at work, my wife and I decided to enjoy dinner here.  The Guinness Shake was great as were the pretzel chips with beer cheese and dijion mustard dipping sauces.  Our server, Eathan was great as well.  He made it pleasent and didn't act as if we were asking to much.  He talked to us and as such made our evening that much better.  The food was also good.  I had the blue ribbon burger, my wife had a burger that they substituted the beef with a turkey patty.  It didn't take forever and a day to have our orders taken or our food delievered.    It was one of the best endings to a week we've had in a long time.

What can I say, I just had the worst experience ever at this brand.  First it took over 20 minutes for our food to be served, no they were NOT that busy.  Then when I asked for the manager I was accused of being difficult and yelling.  All I wanted to know why it was acceptable to serve food with re-solidified cheese and rock hard bread.  I was only told that they were willing to redo my order, this time in a timely manner.  When I insisted on an answer as to why it took so long to begin with I was accused of Yelling, something I was not, YET doing, then WE were asked to leave as I was being difficult.  So we left and yes, I filled out a customer survey on their website, to better help them improve customer service.  I also left behind my loyalty card and I doubt I'll ever be back to this brand again.

I would love to be writing how this whole situation has been resolved, but from my standpoint, it's worse then when it began.    The reason it's worse is that no one above the level of the store manager seems to have any real interest in how a customer was treated.  To be honest, all I wanted was a honest and sincere apology from the ASSt. Manager, I now call, goober.  Sadly this is not what I received.  What's worse is the the "regional manager" even mentioned how this ASSt. managers so call apology, "lacked professionalism and sincerity."  But what can you expect when all goober did was say how there were two sides to every story and then there was the truth as well as he was "no longer concerned with what happened.... I am concerned with the embarrassment it may have caused....." wow, talk about talking about of both sides of ones mouth!    So anyway, the regional manager's attitude is the outcome of this situation is something that is not shared because his staff deserves, "professional courtesy" in how it's been handled, if it's been handled.  I guess we, the customer can be antagonized by the managers as they see fit as we, the customer do not deserve any "professional courtesy" beside being given a check for our sometimes good food, with sometimes refilled fry's.  As far as their philosophy of "honesty, integrity, having fun and learning from something or other".  Well, it doesn't say anywhere on their website that these words apply to the customers and I think I've proven that neither goober, the regional manager of some other bigwig at the corporate office care about those words as they'll not even respond to my e-mails.  So will I ever darken the door of another Red Robin location,,,,,,,,,,,,  I'm sure at some point in my future I'll suffer a cerebral flatulent moment and dine in one of their locations again, but trust me, should my meal come out cold with the cheese looking like dried nasal mucus most commonly seen on a less than alive individual, the entire store, regardless of how full will know about it.

For a fast food restaurant Arbys is the place to go when you don't want a burger.  The food is good, potato cakes enjoyable and service is nice.  I'm not crazy about the breakfast sausage, it way to salty, otherwise, it's o.k.

I learned about Venezia's when they started following me on Twitter.  I finally took the time to stop and I'm glad I did.  The atmosphere was great, the pizza even better.    I must say that wings were also good, but they do need to provide some "wet naps" to clean your hands with when you are done with them.  We'll be going back and enjoying more of their pizza's and maybe even taking the "Party Pizza Challenge"

In the time since the last review the adminstration has changed.  The once Vice-Principal is now the Principal and the school is running smoothly.    My wife, and so far one daughter have graduated from Chaparral.  One more will graduate this year, and next  year we'll have 2 in Chaparral.    We have been very happy with the school, teachers and adminstration.  We just wish they would get the roof top pool fixed for the students.

I have to say that while I didn't eat here, the couple I assisted into the establishment wasn't really thrilled with the food.  First of all, the steaks were NOT cooked to order, a big NO NO for a steak house, second finding the elevator to this location was NO easy task.  And when we arrived and advised the staff they had a reservation, it was like they were being bothered by customer.  So while I was considering taking my wife here for our anniversary, I'll find someplace else.  I don't need to be aggravated on a special evening by an uncaring staff serving improperly cooked, overpriced food.

I started going to Eli's dancing with some friends and during this time I have noticed their hot wings several times.  I finally went here for lunch just to have some wings.  I have to say, these are the best wings I've found since moving to AZ from Ohio.  I also had one of their burgers and it was very tasty as well.    The dancing to live music is also fun making Eli's a great place to eat and have fun.

They went out of thier way to ensure that the 6" sub was not 6".  I'm not sure what the problem is with this location but it seems as if we are a bother when we go there for breakfast sandwiches.  Besides my wife needing to repeat herself twice, she still got hasseled by the crew, as well as the obnoxious teenagers that came in after her and did everything they could to cause problems.    Then to make matters worse, a bun was cut in half for the 6" sub, then another slice was taken off the bun to ensure that her sub was NOT 6".  See picture posted.  Guess we'll have to drive the extra 2 miles and see if that store has more compatent people working there.

We went to this location specifically for breakfast.  I did a head to head comparison of the sausage breakfast burrito by Taco Bell and that of McD's.  What I liked was that the burrito was bigger than Mc.D's they used real cheese and brand named sausage.  What I didn't like was that the burrito was bigger, it needed more filling or a smaller tortilla, one way or another.  It was also missing the onions and peppers.  My wife had the bacon crunch wrap and that was good as it was prepared.  The best part of this visit, was the staff, they answered our questions, ask our opinion and listened.  The manager, David, had a Breakfast burrito made and added the Green Sauce to it, it was really good.  He also advised us that there is a new breakfast menu coming out to all the AZ Taco Bells soon and improvements have been made.    I can't wait to try the new menu, I feel they were on the right track with what they had, and hopefully will continue to get better.

The manager was RUDE.  We stopped in on a Sunday morning and had to wait a little while for anyone to come to the register to wait on the customers that were ahead of us.  Another employee started to take my daughters order and the manager made him stop, not sure why, but she did.  She took our order and when it was kind of thrown on the counter for us to pick up, she made it known she was not happy that I asked for a couple of packets of mayo.  Not sure I'll be back, they don't seem to care about the customers.

Becareful of this drive through location, they could care less if the order is accurate.  My order this morning was short by two, yes two b-burritos.  Sadly this is normal and why I cointinue to visist this location and use it's drive through is beyound me.  I have written to the coproate office, as the reviews for this store are horrible.  Maybe it's time to shut this place down and put in a burger king???

They have a wide selection of everything and a new store to showcase it in.  To bad they did not do a better job cleaning the rust stains off the floor from the last tenant before moving in.    That said, once again they did not have what I wanted.  I had to make do with something else.  I did however, get an offer for help and didn't have to track someone down, as I've done in the past.

What can I say, I HATE Chase.  They care about no one but themselves.  I only stopped as this is the bank that the account is based from.  Since I have no choice in this matter I use Chase, but for my personal banking, I'll stay as far away from Chase as I can.

I'm so glad we were introduced to this brand.  It's so nice to see a movie in very comfortable seats for a reasonable price.  The assigned seating is also a plus but I'm sure you need to buy your tickets ahead of time so you can get a good seat.  Otherwise, I can't wait to see another movie here, and hopefully they'll have one in Phoenix soon, but until then it's worth the drive.

This is my first time back to this location after multiple bad experiences.  I have spoken with a member of the upper management team and I feel that he really doesn't care that I'm complaining about his service.  I have been told by this individual that since he doesn't see it, he doesn't believe it actually happens, or that the employee in question is having an off day.  She seems to have a lot of them.  He also doesn't believe in the reviews that are being posted on sites such as Yelp, foursquare or other social media sites.  It's view as a way for complainers to complain, yet I see a lot of positive reviews.  The fact that they close down an access point on Saturday nights due the car show and then again on Sunday evenings for their deliveries, makes getting into the parking lot a bit of a hassle, but that is what it is.  So I don't go hear as often as I once did, but that is my choice.

I've experianced multiple difficulty's with this Pharmacy, from being rude to outright lies, that were backed up by the "traveling manager" (no longer with the company) and the store manager.   After having spoken to a District Manager on more than one occasion, nothing has changed.  We have moved all but one of our prescriptions to a new pharmacy with a whole lot less attitude.  We only go there for the one prescription, as soon as we can, that will be moved as well so we'll no longer have to deal with this location or Walgreen's.

I'm losing faith in this brand.  I scheduled an appointment for new tires and when I arrived I was treated very rudely by Kyle telling me I had to move my vehicle from in front of the building, yet when others parked in the same place, nothing was said to them.  When my car was finally taken in, 30 minutes past my appointment time, it only took 15 minutes for them to install the tires and I was out the door.  I contacted the corporate office about the appointment situation, it'll be interesting to hear what they say.

It's a hardware store.  AKA a toy store for big boys.  I like the fact they sell Craftsman Tools, but I did find the store employee a lot less than happy that there was a customer in the store. I was asked if I needed some help, when I said what I was looking for, I was given a rather gruff answer as to what Isle it was in.  I did find it, and made a purchase, where the cashier answered a phone call prior to checking me out, guess the phone was a priorty over a customer.  I'll be back only because my experiance at the "other" Ace Hardware store is even worse.  And since Ace Incorporated can only say, they are a franchisee there's not much we can do, which I know is not accurate.

My wife and I just had our eyes examined here and Dr. Fuller did a wonderful job.  He showed concern for our eyesight and was sure to answer all our questions.  I'm looking forward to ordering our new glasses.

I can not believe they would let someone pump gas while smoking a cigarette at the pump.    This morning whiled I was getting gas a Red Vette was being fueled with the driver smoking at the pump he was using to fill his car.    The fact the gasoline vapors are heavier than air lessens the chance of an explosion, does that make it acceptable to smoke while pumping gas?  With all the safety features in place can there still be a catastrophic failure?  What kind of damage would be caused if these tanks were to explode?  Do we really want to find out?  As this Red Corvette was at the pump closest to the buildings and the driver making no attempt to hide his smoking there its no good reason for this not to have been caught.  If you would like, I have the license plate number of the car.

It's a pancake house that's open 24 hours.  While I am a fan of their breakfast items, I can't say that I care for much else on the menu but the burgers.    We have always been treated very nice by the staff and service is fairly quick.  The big plus to this location is that it's located close to the house and open 24 hours.  That means when I have a doctors appointment telling not to eat after midnight, I can come here at 10:30 in the evening, eat something and not be starving by the time I get to my appointment.  This is a big plus for someone like me that gets very hangry.

I can see why Alton Brown likes to stop here.  Sadly if I were to do that I'd soon weigh 300 pounds and have full blown diabetes.  This was only my second time eating ice cream from this brand and it was wonderful. I'll only be able to enjoy it as a very special treat, but it does give me a reason to earn those more often.

Where else can you go for a Candlelight dinner on Valentines Day and NOT spend a fortune?  Yep your local participating Waffle House.  Tonight was my wifes and I third consecutive year going to Waffle House on Valentines Day.  They did a nice job of decorating a section with streamers, tableclothes, Roses and Candles.  There was even a table with Strawberry's and Chocolate.  Aside from being a little ecletic, it's a nice way to enjoy the evening.  Sadly, the dinner was not fullfilling.  Our server forgot our pies, we had to request them, and the staff was enjoying the chocolate covered strawberries set out for the customers.  I can't say I blame them, but when they are blatant about it, thats a little to much.    I'm glad that they went to the trouble of making things nice while still staying true to their own menu.  We'll be back again next year.

I was so not impressed with this visit.  I've been to this location before (prior to becoming a yelper) and it was a good visit.  Tonights visit was so mediocore that I won't be a hurry to go back.  First we went during the last hour of business.  The staff was friendly, there were no long lines but pretty much everything else sucked.  My coffee was lukewarm, at best.  My cream cheese brownie was o.k.  My wifes tea tasted like "strong cough medicine" (her words, not mine) and the icing on her brownie tasted like the can it came out of.  We also got cookies but have not been brave enough to try them.  I doubt they could be anyworse that what we already had.  I understand the desire to go home at the end of a busy day, but really, if you are open you need to be on your A-game, no slacking because it's "close" to closing time.  I finally ate the cookie and I was amazed at how good it was, even 12+ hours later.  Maybe they need to stick to things they know how do and and leave the rest alone?

The crew this morning did not look very happy!  It was way to obvious that they wanted to be somewhere else.  There was a group of people waiting for the hot food, and the line at the register was getting longer and no one seemed very interested in helping the customers.  One employee was just going about stocking items, the fact that there was a line forming didn't seem to matter.  Maybe they need Robert Irvine to come in and show them that customers are a priority and that a smile, pleasant tone and sense of urgency to get food out is what makes a restaurant successful.

I stopped here only because of the reviews on Yelp.  I was not disappointment.  Amanda was the only server working, but it was 1:00 on a Tuesday and I was the only there.  She was very pleasant and greeted me as soon as I walked in the door.  The Honey Hot wings were recommended and thus was ordered.  They were grilled after they were deep fried and had plenty of sauce on them.   When the wings were served so was I present a "cadaver bucket" inwhich to place the rements of the eaten morsels.  I appreciated the humor in this is and did LOL.  The wings tasted very good.  I also got the deep fried pickles.  I was not as impressed with them as I was the wings.  I felt the batter on some was not fried all the way through and was soggy.  There was also a lack of taste in the pickles.  Overall I was very pleased with both them meal and service and will be visiting again soon and as often as I can.

I took my wife here for dinner so she could experiance what I had.  There food was great but it seemed as if they were a little short staffed as we waited several minutes before anyone came an took our order.  After we place our order the appatizers came out in a timely manner and tasted great, they also made a special burger for my wife, but the time it took to get served was way longer that it should have been.   We hope things get better or all the remodeling they are doing will only benifit they next tenant

Although it's been a while since I've last eaten here, I have always enjoyed this brand.  Tonight was no exception.  I got the 6oz sirlion and it was very tender and tasty.  My wifes salad wasn't quite as good but the Mac-n-cheese made up for that as did her soup.  Hopefully it won't be years before we go back.

This is my wifes doctor and I accompany her to many of her appointments.  The staff is friendly to a point. They have early hours, which is great.  The biggest problem is that it's difficult to see the Doctor.  My wife has seen mainly the Nurse Practioner or PA.  That could be due to a one doctor office.  To be fair, I have nothing against NP's or PA's, I've worked with both for years.   My biggest complaint, beside not being able to see the doctor, is the communications.  A recent and very concerning produre was done a several weeks ago and the Doctor's office DID NOT communicate the results in a timely manner.  We wear able to the the lab results before the doctors office called to say everything was O.K..  During that time, my wife sat, wondered and worried.  This was not good.

It's a buffet in a casino, meaning it's difficult to get into, enjoy your meal and get out of.  The line starts to form 2 hours before they even open for business, meaning you're gonna be waiting way longer than you should as the food is not really much better than anywhere else, nor are the prices.  The noice from the casino makes the visit less than pleasurable and to be honest, I only went because of the family I work for.  I won't be going back anytime soon as I'm not a gambler either.

I was ignored.  It was the end of the business day and the whole place was rather busy, and they only had one, yep, that's right, one cashier working.  There were more present, but only one was actully ringing people out.  He was very pleasant, but I could not believe that I was actully looked at by other employee's, whom then turned around and started flirting with a co-worker.  I don't stop here very often, and this a good reason for me to keep that attitude up.

I've eaten here a few times now and the food has always been very good.  For me it's a 30 minute drive to get here, but it's worth the trip to get to a good Buffet.  I may not eat here often, but when I do, I know it'll be worth it.

I'm sorry I have to disagree with other reviews on how fast and friendly this location is.  I will agree that it is clean, but that is all.  I have never been here and gotten in and out in anything less than 45 minutes.  The staff at the front is rude, they do not answer questions, the phone calls take priority and they just basically don't care.  The numbering system is the screwiest I've ever seen, there is no rhyme or reason to what is going on.  When you do get called to a rep. they just don't seem to really care.    I have been fourtunate in that once we get to a rep, we have been able to complete our task quickly, but the hurry up and wait process needs a lot of work

As a rule, I only go to wally-world when I absolutely have to.  I have no respect for this company in any way shape or form.    While I have no way of knowing and therefore will not repeat, some of the tactics I have heard that are employeed by wally-world, I do feel that way to many of them are somewhat accurate, which is why I won't shop here unless I have to.

I did something today that I never had to do before and that was cancel an order.  I place and paid for my order online and got a confirmation e-mail with an estimated delivery time of 31-41 minutes.  As I have ordered in this manner, from this location countless times before I was confident that all would go well.  I was sadly mistaken.  After 50 minutes I called and was told that it would be delivered "any minute" they had experianced a rush.  When I stated that I had ordered on a friday evening and got faster service than tonight, I was then told they were short staffed.  See where this is going, one excuse after another.  As we are only 5-6 mins from the store, I waited another 10 minutes, we are now at 1 hour past order placement.  Nothing, another call, spoke to the store manager, and more excuses, they were busy....  When I said how I'd already been told it would be delivered any minute and that hadn't been accurate, I was told I don't know what to say.  Well I knew what to say, CANCEL MY ORDER, REFUND MY MONEY.  Now it was guilt trip time.  You want me to cancel the order even thought the drive has already left?  Why, yes I do.  I do not have to tolerate being lied to.  I also did not belive that the driver had left.  I e-mailed the cust. serv. to see what they have to say.  only time will tell about that.  The worst part of all this, I have never had any problems with this location before.  However it only takes one time of poor service to loose a customer forever.  That may be what they have accomplished with their poor service and lies.

This place is a joke!  Went through the drive thru at 9:00 for a soda and ice cream cone and was told the ice cream machine was already turned off.  Was offered a cup of ice cream from the freezer.  Kind of takes the whole "soft" out of soft served ice cream.  I have have no faith in local franchise owners caring much about anything other than the money they make, I contacted the corporate office so hopefully they'll do something about this situation.

This was the first Casino I've been to outside of Vegas.  I'm sorry, but the ambiance is just not the same.  As I'm not really a gambler of any sorts, I did not find anything special about this location.    The carts roming the parking lots make getting into the Casino great, but other than that, I have no real reason to go back.  I also have no real reason to go to any Casino, so I don't.

Sadly, JCP is predicted to be closing up shop soon and the way this location is ran I understand why.  First they've moved the online ordering pick up location and guess what, they don't give you any idea where it is.  Next if you order something say like a watch,  you have to pick it up in the Jewelry dept so it doesn't get stolen.  Add to all this the fact I waited at a cash register for over 5 minutes, yet I timed it, and no one came to even say HI, I did wave at the camera that oversee's the register, but they didn't wave back and they didn't send anyone either.  Then to top it all off, 8 day's after picking up my watch the battery died, went to have it replaced, which they did at no cost, but they also didn't set the time as it must have been to inconvient for the dude in the green shirt.    So I'm sure I'll be back, but it won't be my go to shopping place.

This is the second time our family has been to Dr. Galati's office for braces.  He and his staff have always been caring and professional in the care they provide and the manner they treat the family.  Dr. Galati's care, professionalism and attention to detail are second to none.  It's a great comfort to know that  Dr. Galati and his staff are taking care my family's orthodontic needs

I was not impressed.  This was my first visit to this establishment as well as my last.  The two employees working did not have enough respect to even say hello.    We sat ourselves and waited while we continued to be ignored.  After a few minutes it was time to leave.  Just as when we arrived, we left without do much as a goodbye.  Maybe if they last long enough this memory will be buried deep in my subconsciousness and I'll give it another try.  I don't suggest holding your breath though.

Although the USPS has been an "employee owned" entity since the 80's, it's still regulated and overseen by the Federal Government, which means, that Postal Employee's can get away with doing absolutely nothing, and when they get fired, they can sue and get their jobs back, with back pay, can you believe that.  That being said, this branch sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!  I have been told by members of management that they are to busy to ensure that Box Mail get put into the correct boxes......................WTF, can you believe that, they are just to busy to deliver the mail properly.  If they put it in the wrong box, it sits there until the person that has that box checks the mail and returns it for being in the wrong box.  Yes this has happened to me.  I have waited up to six weeks to get mail sent to my P.O. Box.  and this is for my business.  Not only are they to busy to get it right, they DO NOT CARE.  They have returned mail stating that my box is closed and that I did not leave a forwarding address................. Yep, that rights, they have done this at least 3 times.  The one time I was sent of photo of the package and I filed a complaint with the Postal Inspector, and since it wasn't in their jurisdiction, they downgraded it to a minor complaint.  I was told by the customer service rep, that she was going to speak to the Manager of the Branch and have him request that my mail is properly delivered to my box.  She must not have heard me when I stated the I was told by management they were to busy to ensure mail was delivered properly.  The last thing about the P.O. Boxes, if you plan your trip by the times posted on the wall, do not expect the mail to actually be in the boxes by the time on that sign.  I have also been in after the box mail was supposed to be delivered, nothing in my box, went back that evening and sure enough there was mail in my box.  Again I was told that if someone called in sick or if they were "short" staffed, that the box mail WAS NOT A priority, again WTF.    As far as staffing, I have been in line with a bunch of other people, waiting for what seemed like FOREVER, there were 4 or 5 clerks, taking care of customers, and one clerk just decided that it was break time, and left.  The dozen or more people waiting for services were left waiting, the customers didn't matter, and yes I have delayed going on a break due to a "rush".  So why, do you ask, do I use the branch, simple, it would cost me to much money to have all my business cards reprinted.  Not to mention the hassle of changing all the addresses.  I know I will in the near future have to make that switch, and will do so willing, but I will coordinate it with my business card reprinting.  That is unless there is some major improvement, but as the USPS is going bankrupt, I don't see that happening anytime soon.  Maybe it's time the only LEGAL Monopoly allowed in the United States goes out of business, but that is just me.

When I go out to eat at a place that looks like this brand, the last thing I expect to do is stand in line to order my food.  I've heard they have good food, but for me, I want to go in sit down and have a server take my order.  If I want to place an order at the counter, I'll go to Taco Bell

This was my first every trip to a dermatologist, and while I wasn't seen by Dr. LaTowsky, the doctor that did see me was great.  They listened to my concerns and did what I was asked.  I hope not to see her or her staff often, but when I do, I'm certain I'll be taken care of.

Having served in the fire service for 15+ years this brand brings back memories.  It's always neat to see the pictures that each location as they are almost from the area local to the location.  The food has also always been good  My problem with this location was the fact that the staff seem very OK. with the customer with the young bird on their finger.  They had no problem that it was at the cash register as well as at the drink station.  I have no idea what type of bird it was, as it was chirping and still very young.  Therefore it was not a "service animal".  That and the fact that the State of AZ just passed legislation to mirror the ADA that BIRDS are NOT recognized service animals and therefore NOT PERMITTED in public venues.  The owners of the bird seemed to enjoy the fact they were getting away with having their bird in a restaurant.  Myself, I guess I signed up for their newsletter to soon.  What will be interesting is, even though Yelp discourages the solicitation of reviews, and Firehouse Subs asks for them, I wonder if they'll reply to this review?

I've been waiting to update my review of this location as to the owner sending me message about my experiance.  Sadly I was forced to repeat myself as to the day, date and time of my experiance.  As all the information was available already, I do not feel that it was necessary to ask for it again.  It was also stated that the owner and fanchisee was not present as they.  So I replied with a lenghty responce as to what had happend and provided details that I was unaware of at the time of my review.  You see the counter was to my back.  I did look over my shoulder and saw the bird, so I know it was there, I also heard it.  What I didn't know until I spoke to my wife was that the bird was sat on the counter at the cash register................................ Can you belive that, a live animal on a food service counter, NO WAY, but yep it happened.    Anyway, I sent a reply to clear up my review had caused and included my phone number with a request that I be called.  Nothing, nada, zilch, nyet...........  Guess making contact with the customer to ensure that there will never be a repeat of this type of incident is out of the question, guess corporate H.Q. needs to be notified.  Wanna quess where my next e-mail will go?

Late dinner, could have been our last.  I really try NOT to post totally negative reviews cause everyone is entitled to have a bad day, but this one takes the cake.    When we arrived at about 8:30 they were doing thier nightly cleaning.  It appears as if the ice cream machine was being clean, so no ice cream desert, one section of the dining room was closed off and blocked with chairs, which by the way was also blocking a fire exit, I told the manager but she just knodded her head, admited the exit was block and then went back to work, without moving the chairs.  I'm sure glad it didn't catch fire while we were eating.    If you are wondering what kind of problem a couple of chairs could cause, just think something like Beverly Hills Supper Club Fire, in the 1970's.    Althought the food tasted o.k., the side dishes were not with the proper sandwich, making things a little frustrating.    I've e-mail the corporate office about the whole blocking the exit thing, it will be interesting to hear what they have to say.  I'll update when I hear from them.

The manager, owner or some bigwig called me this past Friday morning about my comment made to their website, and in the interst of saving time and space on yelp, he basicly threw his staff under the bus and stated they were cleaning that area of the dining room and were just to lazy to use the "wet floor" signs.  The fact that the area, by his admission was cleaned over 45 mins prior to my saying anything was not addressed.  He also claimed that they are cleaning and sanitizing the custard machine constantly so they can serve fresh custard.  Again, I don't think so.  I've worked behind the counter at enough fast food restaraunts to know that icecream machines are not constantly cleaned, otherwise, they would never serve anything out of them.  I've also seen crews breakdown machines early so they didn't have to stay any longer than possible after closing time.   He also viewed the video and saw people moving the chairs to leave, so using them was just an act of lazyness on the part of his crew.   So what does this mean for me?????  Culver's will not be my first choice, but if I'm looking for something different I'll stop in, but I'm not sure it'll be after 1:00 in the afternoon, otherwise, I might catch them in the middle of cleaning something.

I wasn't impressed, went in for a replacement part, the staff was rude, made no attempt to even stand up and talk to me, got someone else that might "know" what I was talking about, he was also rude and wanted to argue with me about the part I needed and how it wasn't used in their system.  Finally gave me the number of the company that makes them so I could get what I needed.  Thankfully I don't buy appliances very often as I don't want to become a regular at this brand.

I have to admit that I do not do a lot of shopping at this location, the fact that it also has a USPS outlet is the reason I go.  Even with that, they staff is always friendly and they do not seem to mind the traffic generated by the Post office.

we stopped here for my birthday brunch and I'm glad we did.  It's a little confusing as the main entrance is from the courtyard area and we ended coming in from the back door and had to walk all the way to the front so we could be seated.  Thankfully that didn't take to long and our server was prompt in getting to us.  Our food came out in a timely manner and tasted great.  We got a small bacon board and the four flavors we tried were all very good.  Since it was my birthday I got a bacon maple doughnut and it was wonderful.  I can't wait to be back again.

It's nice when you walk into a store and tell them what kind of shoe you are looking for based on your particulare needs.  This is what we did on this visit and the employee took us right to the shoes that would benifit us.  There was no trying to upsell us to a more exspensive style or brand of shoe.    The worst part was they didn't have the size and color my wife wanted.  The did check thier inventory, found they were listed at another store, called and had them put on hold.

We found out this location is a nice walk from our home for a peacefull diner.  The food is great as is the staff.    Our last visit included hotwings.  While they tasted great, there needed to be some more heat.  The only other thing is they need pitchers of beer.

I have to say that so far I've been very please with the service I've gotten and this establishment.  I like being able to "walk in".  In doing this I understand that sometime I might have to wait and that's o.k.  It's better than making an appointment and showing up only to be forced to wait for over 30 minutes like the last salon I was going to.

I enjoy going to this store as the staff seems to know what they are talking about.  On this visit I asked Jan, the asst Mgr how I would know if my master cylinder was going bad.  She describe everything that I was experiencing.  I got to have brakes, so on to Moe to order one.  He was pleasant knowledgeable and looked up my part and placed the order.  In a few hours when it arrived he called to tell me it was ready to pick up.    So I picked it up, put it on and now I can stop on a dime.

This was the first time I've eaten at this resturaunt and to be honest, I had it confused with a simulair establishment with a simulair name.  I went in skeptical but open minded.  I must admit I was glad it wasn't the other place.  The staff was nice, the food was good, the service fairly quick.  I don't believe I have one of these stores near me, but if I'm in this area I won't hesistate to go back.

Does the owner of this store NOT watch shows like, Restaurant Impossible, Mystery Diners, Restaurant Steakout?  If not, maybe he should as this store is likely to be an episode on one of these shows in the very near futre.  Lets start with the drive through.  The sign is posted in such a manner that in order to see the left side you have to be position away from the little speaker thingy to place your order.  Maybe this is due to the rising sun.  If thats that case, move the speaker thingy so our orders can be heard.  I'm certin that our order was translated into mandarian chinese sometime between the time it left our mouth and entered the speaker thingy, as we had to repeat our order multiple times and they still got it wrong.  Next, is the staff even trained at this location??????  Really, the young man taking our order didn't know a thing about the iced tea they served.  A major epic fail on menu knowledge, he didn't listen to the order as he got it 33% wrong, another major epic fail.  Last the young ladie at the window.  Maybe she could have actully looked at the receipt and given us the proper order.  I'll bet we got a half dozen dounuts meant for the car behind us as we only ordered  12 and got 18.  Had they not taken their good ole sweet time getting our order to us, and had she listend to me the first time I asked for the tea and cup of ice I ordered, instead of making me ask twice more, one for the tea and ice, then again for the ice.  I might have focused on the fact we had two boxes of doughnuts, and returned the extra box.  As it was, I was running behind in getting my wife to work and the frustration of almost begging for tea and a cup of ice.   I'm assuming the tall gentleman present in the shirt and tie was the manager, but he wasn't doing much managing from what I could tell.  It's also apparent that the staff was not very well trained and didn't know what products they carried or how to properly take an order.  If thinks keep going in this direction KK will once again be a figment in the imagination of Arizonianians.

I was not impressed by the high dollar mediocre items this brand has to offer.   The biggest difference between Home Goods and Hobby Lobby is the arts and crafts, making Hobby Lobby the better choice

I recently saw this brand on Undercover Boss and with one just around the corner finally gave it a try.  The service was great, the coffee even better, now I just need to make it part of my daily routine

What is there not to like about this place?  I love the decor and the food has been great.  Of course my years as a firefighter might cause me to have a slight biased towards Firehouse Subs.  In all honesty, this location did a great job, it was clean the food was good and we enjoyed it.  We'll be back and are looking forward to more opening up.

This was the second time I've eaten from Portillo's and the first time I've been here.  I must say, they have this down to a science.    When I arrived the line started only a few feet inside the door (that's what I get for going there at lunch time).  The drive through line had over 12 cars in it.  At this time I almost abandoned my lunch from here.  I'm glad I didn't.  From walk-in to walk-out was only 15 minutes.  If you never been there, they take the orders at the back of the restaurant.  We were handed a menu when we walked in, as we got close to the register our orders were written onto a bag so all we had to do was hand it to the person at the register.  We were then directed to the pickup counter and given a number.  I can't say how many people we in front of us, it was a lot, but the staff keep things moving.  There was someone at the front calling out numbers ready for pickup and keeping things moving and most importantly keep people from hanging on the counter while they waited, making those getting their food difficult.  She was very pleasant and interjected humor in all the right places.    I will admit that I have waited longer at other so called fast food establishments for lower quality food.  As my daughter and I were picking up lunch for mom/wife, we were only a few minutes behind schedule and this stop made it worth it.  Another couple having lunch near us was in awe that we had brought in Portillo's.  The food was good, the malt was great and lunch was perfect.

This is the most difficult gas station to maneuver in.  If the arrows are followed this in only one way in and one way out.  Sadly not everyone follows the arrows, making things even more difficult.   I doubt this well get any better as they are landlocked.  That is why I only buy gas here when I have to.    Like all Fry's they accept your discount points, so be sure to use them, it can make a difference.

I choose to stop patronizing this brand after they ignored us for 15 plus minutes and then told us we had to wait an additional 10 minutes even though we had an appointment.   My wife and I left with her crying because the day they did this to us was her birthday.  But that's O.K. we found someplace else that does a great job.

Located on Cholla street West of Tatum Blvd, this park is well laid out and has lots to do for it's rather small space.  You will find two sand volleyball courts, one full size Basket ball court and play ground equipment for toddlers.  Also present are picnic areas complete with grills for you to enjoy a cookout.  There is a big grassy area for relaxing or tossing your Frisbee.  A sidewalk surrounds the park making for a nice walk if you want to exercise.  The area around the toddle play equipment has a soft material directly around the equipment surrounded by sand to help protect the children.  Along the perimeter are exercise stations to help you with your work out.  I strongly suggest that if you choose to use this equipment that you have some gloves on.  the texture of the bars are very rough and will give you blisters in no time if you do not take precautions and protect yourself.    The only draw back I can see is there are no makers to give you any idea of how far you have traveled.  That would be nice, but it's not there.

This place ROCK'S. being a retire firefighter I do enjoy the smell of smoke especially when I know it being used to cook some delicious meats.  I've been here several times now and have tried most everything on the menu.  The burgers, chips and hot wings are some of the best I've eaten.  My wife loves the coleslaw.  The staff members have always been friendly and offered great suggestions.  So while the food is hot, the beer cold and the staff wonderful, the only thing I can't brag enough on is the are the prices.  I know I'll be back and I'll enjoy being here, sadly I can't afford to eat here as often as I'd like.

This Is not a $6.00+ combo.  Come on really, a frozen patty only 1/4" thick for a "charburger"?  I think not.  I was not impressed by this brand.  I found it to be way overpriced.  The burger tasted like pretty much any other burger you get from a fast food burger joint.  This location has minimual seating.  I honestly wasn't sure I was going to actully be able to sit inside and I didn't want to sit outside.    The staff was very friendly, it didn't take long to get my meal, but those were the only good things about this visit.  French fries were just that french fries.    While others may make a "Habit" of eating here, I will not.

While I can say that the food tasted good, I can't say I got my money's worth!  My wife has been wanting to eat here for sometime as it's all the rave at her workplace.  So this past weekend we were out during the afternoon and decided to stop.  Actually I stopped to surprise her.  I wish I had gone someplace else as a 40.00 check for the two of us was to much for what we got.  First, the set up is rather silly, your assigned a table number, then you place your order and pay for it, including your beverage.  Then you sit at your table and wait and for your food to be delivered.  The service was done with a smile and food was brought to the table in a timely manner.  Like I already said, the food tasted good, that was all.  My biggest issue is that for the amount of money we paid, there should have been hamburger hanging over the side of the bun.  I should not have had a 1/2 of bun all the way around the pattie.  This is just bad business.  When my plate was delivered I had to actually look under the top of the bun to make sure the meat wasn't missing.  It wasn't, but I was rather upset to have an anorexic piece of meat, I was not please to say the least.  The good thing is that the larger order of fries was just right for my wife and I, the beer was cold and tasted good, but again, we did not get a good meal for our $40.00

Why did I wait so long???  This Brand is less than 2 miles from my house and yet this was my first visit, shame on me!  To be honest my thoughts were "just another pizza place with mediocre pizza".  I was wrong.  I had the "Angry Bird", my wife had the "Spicy Butcher".  Both were really good.  The service was great and I love the beer refills.  This is also the perfect time of year to sit at their outside patio and enjoy a great pizza, cold beer and best of all, wonderful company!  I'm certin that I'll be back, with friends and family just because it's close, it's good and the prices are reasonable.

Never before have i been told I would be charged for someone else's mistake until today.  The you man at the register was not interested in doing his job and as soon as his phone rang he rushed through ringing my order so he could answer it.  Well, my fries were not made properly so when I said something as asked they be made correctly I was told I'd pay more.  This I refused to do as it wasn't my fault.  Then the young man wants to argue with me.  Now we're in a mall food court, I have a big mouth and I'm not afraid to use so I made sure that it was known I wasn't paying any extra since his phone was more important than his job.  The rest of the staff agreed I should not be charged more even though the young man wanted me to.  In the end I won the battlw, they lost a customer.

I like this brand not only for their food, as it is great, but I like the decor.  After 25 years in the Fire/EMS service, these locations bring back memories and fills the tummy with some great subs.

I wasn't impressed with the food or service.  Whats worse, I'm thinking they over charged us for our so called "starter" that came out about half way through our meal.  The food wasn't bad, but for 10.00 I'm thinking my burger should not have been as anorexic as it was.  The bread pudding I had for dessert was nothing to write home about as it just didn't taste like bread pudding should.

I'm sad, not really though, to report that I found nothing special about this brand.  The service was mediocre at best, the food while almost tasty did leave a lot to desire and when you add into the mix that we had to ASK for napkins, wait several minutes for them to serve the rice and not bring silverware, causing me to eat with a serving spoon, guess it's a good think I have a big mouth.  I'll not be rushing to eat her again even though I really enjoy Thai food.  Guess I was spoiled by a previous Thai Restaurant that has sadly gone out of business.

I'd love to be writing a raving review but sadly I can not do for many reasons.  The good thing about this brand is the servers were very friendly, the inside clean and in good repair the atmosphere was excellent.  My wife and I were able to talk and to hear each other, it was wonderful.  Sadly, those are the good points.  The bad, and there is NO reason for these to have occurred.  The pretzel bites had several that were burnt, and yes they tasted burnt.  Our burgers were ordered medium and came to us medium rare.  The aolia was barely noticeable and.we.both asked for more and I can get more French Fry's in on a value menu at a burger chain than I got here. A major issue with my burger was that I ordered a blue cheese burger and I didn't even taste the blue cheese.  Add to this that I ordered the same drink 3 times, all 3 tasted different, and let's not forget we needed to stop another server to request a second round of drinks.  To top it all we got the cookie desert, yes it resembled a simular desert that can easily be found at another restaurant but that's it.  The cookie was small, ice cream was scarce and the edges burnt.  If this had been a busy night with a packed house I might be able.to understand some of.these issues. It wasn't, so I don't understand the reason for poor guality food and less than stellar service.  The worst part of this visit, it was my birthday and I had been looking forward  to eating here since I saw signs about its opening along Shea.  While this experience didn't affect my birthday, I'm not really sure when, or if I'll eat here again.

I watched as this salon was preparing to open and wished I started coming here sooner.  They're clean, modern design makes it warm and inviting while getting your nails and pedicures done.   Unlike the other salons I've visited the staff her remembers my name and the actually talk to me instead of those around them.   I get both my fingernails and pedicures done by Lynn.  She does a great job and is a pleasure to talk with while she works.  I'll be enjoying the "jelly water" pedicure soon.  It's a bit pricy but our feet deserve to be pampered once in a while, don't they?

I have enjoyed the lever of compassion and care that I get from my Primary Care Doctor and the staff at this location.  The fact that it's close to home is a huge plus, add to that the ease of getting an appointment and you can't ask for much more from a doctors office.  The onsite lab office makes getting blood drawn as painless as getting blood drawn can be.

I have to admit I'm very disappointing with this location.  I've eaten at the Mesa location and it was a great experience, so we were excited when we saw this location opening up near our home..  I didn't remember being taken to a seat, then placing the order like it was done at this location.  While the food was decent the fact that they only sold beer by the bottle was a pain as you had to go to the bar if you wanted another.  I think beer the pitcher would have been better.  The worst part is the second time we ordered from here they got it wrong.  It was so crowed and noisy when we picked up our order that we just ate what we got and didn't bother to complain.  I'm sure we'll be back, I just don't know when that'll be.

For a craft store, Micheal's is a nice place to go.  Each store is laid out differently making going from one to another kindof difficult.  I also found the employee's were not very interested in helping the customers as they were difficult to find.  Checking out was another story of hurry up and wait.
