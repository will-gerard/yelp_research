I love the staff at Sonoran Hills Dental! They make you feel like family when you come into the office. Dr. Ito is a fantastic dentist. He once came in on a Saturday afternoon because I broke a crown! I really appreciated his willingness to come in on his day off! My cleanings are thorough and Michelle is a great hygenist. I recommend them to everyone!

They advertised a 50% off online pizza orders. I ordered pizza an hour and 15 minutes ago. I called and they said it just came out of the oven. They said they were slammed because of the coupon. If you advertise that, you should have the staff to back it up!!!! BOO!!!!!

I've gone here off and on over the last couple of years. I will not be back. The lady that did my nails was rude. I showed her a flower design on my phone and she refused to do it in the colors I wanted. Then she told me to pick from their designs. I found something I liked and she told me it would cost $20 extra. I said that was fine and she then told me it would take too long. The man (who is the manager) came over when he heard me complaining to my daughter. I told him what had transpired and he was trying to justify her answers to me. I let him know that I was very unhappy with rude treatment and her lack of ability to do nail art when that's why they have won awards. He then offered to do a design for me. I refused because I was already upset. While I was drying, the nail tech was busy packing her things to leave for the day and carrying them out to her car. There was still 30 minutes left until they were closing, so it's not like I came last minute. I WILL NEVER BE BACK!!!

We go here so often that we have personalized chopsticks here! The sushi is absolutely wonderful. We've tried other places, but no one has the quality and tastiness that Sushi Eye does! I would give it a 5 star, but the service can be slow at times. We'll keep coming back though because owner/chef Richard Cho is a sushi genius! The ASU roll is the BEST! Also try the Las Vegas Roll and Lion King Roll. The beef udon soup is terrific too!

Absolutely delicious and artfully served gourmet menu! We reserved the brick oven private dining and enjoyed the chef's gourmet menu with wine pairings! The ingredients are all locally grown and harvested and the meats are produced locally too. Chef Dustin has been trained well in Tuscany and creates some beautiful and tasty delights! Well worth the money!

Absolutely delicious! The only downside was they ran out of some of the menu items, but what they had was great! The service was terrific and he was very helpful in making decisions between menu items. This is a great place for special occasions and romantic dinners!

We couldn't get a reservation until late and when we got there they sat us in a closed section. We finally had to get up and ask for service after waiting over 30 minutes for help. Once they did help us and we received our food, they didn't come back to refill our drinks or ask if we needed anything else. We probably would have had more wine and other refills if they had.   The food, however, was very delicious, well presented and there were several unique items on the menu. I had an Avocado and habenero shrimp salad that was delicious. My hubby had the short rib enchiladas which were also delicious.   Our experience would have been fabulous if not for the poor service.

Oscar and Warren were fantastic! They knew exactly what I needed to fix my Samsung Galaxy 4 and were able to do the repair in less than 3 hours. My phone looked brand new when I picked it up!

Delicious! I've eaten here three times now and tried 3 different things and they were all terrific! The lunch specials during the week are great and inexpensive! The kids meals are terrific too! My picky grandchild loved the meatballs and broccoli.

My nails were a mess after having worn acrylics for over 10 years. I'm now going natural and my nails look better than ever! Lekisha is using the IBX system to strengthen my nails. They no longer crack and chip and are actually growing! She's awesome!
