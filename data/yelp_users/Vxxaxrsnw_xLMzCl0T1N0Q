This place is essentially a Jimmy Buffett themed TGI Fridays.  And I don't mean that as a compliment.  I split the quesadillas as an appetizer and they weren't good.  There was some sort of pepper relish in them that added a weird flavor.  For the entree I had the tortilla soup which was very average (kind of watery but avocados were fresh, so they get points for that).  I got the sense that they were known for their burgers, so I might recommend sticking with those if you insist on going.  But overall, I thought this place was cheesy and pretty mediocre.

Quintessential dive-y Mexican restaurant.  My family has been going here for 20 years (gosh, that makes me sound old) and it's just as good as it always was.  Don't expect any frills (like ANY), but do expect some tasty good.  I always get the machaca beef plate and I'm never disappointed.  TIP: if you're going on a weekend, get there early or be prepared to wait!

When it comes to fast food, it truly doesn't get any better than this!  Friendly, efficient employees, fresh ingredients, clean stores...and, oh yeah, the DELICIOUS food!  Go for an animal style burger and a chocolate shake--I promise you won't be disappointed!

This is probably my favorite restaurant in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area.  Ingredients are fresh, service is friendly and efficient, and nothing beats sipping a glass of wine on their patio after a long day of shopping.  The salads are always a good bet, as are the pizzas.  Also, make sure you get the focaccia and sundried tomato butter--delish!

I thought BLT burger was pretty good!  I disagree with some of the other reviews--the shafts blue burger was great!  Shafts blue cheese is a more sophisticated blue, so maybe you just need the right palate.  The waffle fries are addictive and though prices aren't cheap, they are definitely reasonable for Vegas.

We had a good stay here, but I can easily see how someone would not.  The hubs and I were visiting family and decided we needed a night to ourselves, so we booked a room midweek.  The hotel was pretty dead so we were upgraded to a "party suite" overlooking the pool...sweet, indeed!  We had a very comfortable stay, but we did see signs that said that a DJ spun every Thursday-Saturday at the pool until 2am.  Since I'm not 21 years old, a MBA student, or celebrating my bachelorette party, there's no doubt that would have sucked!  So, if you're not looking to actually party, I'd recommend skipping the party suite or any room that overlooks the pool.

Big Earl's gets big raves from me!  The blue burger is great, as are the fries.  The only thing I didn't love was the milkshake.

Even if this wasn't airport food, this place would be pretty good.  Think of it as a more expensive chipotle (minus the E. coli).  I got the shredded beef bowl for $10 and was pleasantly surprised.  Also, guac is included, so kudos for that.  Wait time was also shorter than most other airport options.  We were lucky enough to snag a seat, but tables are limited.

SALT!  This place needs to add some salt to their ingredients.  My hubby and I split an artichoke and a cheese pizza and both were severely lacking in flavor.  I thought the cheese was better than the artichoke but at $10+ per pizza, I was expecting more.  I know it's airport food, but it didn't inspire me to visit the actual restaurant.
