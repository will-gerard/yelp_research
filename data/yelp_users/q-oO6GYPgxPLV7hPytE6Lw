The wait is actually reasonable for how busy the restaurant is. I could eat here every single day!!!! Best breakfast spot in Arizona.

My husband and I love Yen. When we first started going there it was a much smaller place, they have $5 happy hour from 3-5 then 8 to close. The $5 happy hours rolls have expanded, and so has the restaurant.  They have gotten much busier and its so great to see a small business do well!  The staff is great and when they are packed the weight still isn't too long.  If you go try the hot green tea!!! Its great!

A few weeks ago when the outbreak broke in Boston of ecoli, my husband got sick from this location. Spent the night in the E.R., with Ecoli/food poisoning and kidney pain (just like the Boston students). I tried to call the location and the manager was no help, I tied asking if anyone else was sick and just give the heads up. The manager was 100% out of the loop, had no idea of what to tell me. NEVER EATING CHIPOLTE again!!!

My husband and I frequent this location and tonight was hands down the best experience that we have had. Not only was our waitress great but we had the chance to meet the manager, Lynn.  What made the experience so unique was seeing a manager that not only really loves their job but the company that she works for. Lynn was personable and you could tell that she is passionate about her job, and thats something to admire.  You don't see that very much now days.  Next time we go, we will be calling ahead to make sure our favorite manager will be there!!!!! Thanks Lynn!!!
