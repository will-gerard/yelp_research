Hands down the best brewery in Arizona! Nothing comes close. If you are not from the great state of Arizona I recommend you try the Kilt Lifter. But all their beers are amazing! Haven't had one I disliked! I usually go in late night and the bouncers are funny attractive and super friendly! The general manager Patrick Murphy is a super friendly and helpful. The food is always tasty as well. I recommend getting something wrapped in beer bread! I usually do a French dip in beer bread. I promise you will not be disappointed

So this my favorite brewery in Arizona! As I entered the door I was greeted by two buff door men. There names were Trevor and Eric. They were super friendly and helpful and had a lot of recommendations! I went to bar and knew what I wanted! I am regular at the Scottsdale location! My bartender was Marcus who was awesome! The manager who they called Penny came and check on me which made the night even better! What a great location and the staff were phenomenal

I have never been here before. Don't know how, z tejas has been around awhile but I came in right before happy hour ended. my server Vanessa was awesome and scored me beer right before it ended. She was really friendly and provided great service. I ordered the street tacos which were quite tasty!! Then I switched up and went to the bar to watch the rest of the finals. Both bartenders were fun and cool (didn't catch their names though) ordered a cheese cake. Smart move because it was delicious. All in all a good time.

Horrible service! I have been at the place twice! I asked 4 diffrent people for a side! Eventually had to walk up to the bar! I was very dissapointed both times! I even ask my waiter what was wrong his answer was it is what is! Food is decent tho, but do not expect even decent service
