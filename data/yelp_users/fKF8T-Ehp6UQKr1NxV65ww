I attended a work dinner here at Red Square at Mandalay. The waitstaff was friendly but very inept. They delivered a wine that was two years more recent than ordered and continued to bungle. The stroganoff was not as food as the hamburger helper version. I'd avoid this place, especially for the money.

It was my buddy's birthday and our trip to celebrate in Vegas had a number of stops that he wanted to do as adventures. One was a happy feet massage. We relied on a cab driver to help us find Good Massage and we were very happy with the massages all four of us received.   The staff doesn't speak English a lot, but are very courteous and nice. They serve some tea, cookies and candies as you wait.

I found myself, along with some friends, wandering the streets of Tempe, after a University of Washington v. Arizona State loss. We found a quick table available at the World of Beer, and were really attracted to the place based on some online reviews attacking the owner. But, we wanted to check it out for ourselves. Great service, pretty much. And when it wasn't great service and we let them know, we were comp'd our appetizer, thanks! Go Dawgs!
