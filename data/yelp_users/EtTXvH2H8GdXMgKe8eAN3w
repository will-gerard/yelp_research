Hands down, my favorite place for hair extensions. Always great service and a clean environment. The place is organized and wasy to find what you are looking dor. I give them 4 out of 5 because they don't carry Bohyme pro-tips. Other than that, this place is a go to for synthetic and real hair.

Venezias has been my favorite go to pizza place for well over five years! I have tried a lot of other pizza joints and they have never compared to this place. They have awesome pizza slice deals throughout the day and literally the best ranch ever! I love this place!

First let me just say, Arriba's is definitely under rated! Their food has always been good every time I go and their menu has a lot of variety with a picture for every item! What always brings me back though is their BOMB.COM bean dip that has a little spice! It is soooo good!! The only reason I gave them four instead five stars is because they could work on their customer service. Besides that, the restaurant is decorated really cool and their food is delicious!! Yummy!

This is my favorite nail place and I've tried a lot in the east valley! I even drive a 25 minute drive to get there passing other nail salons. Coffee rush next door is a big bonus too, other than how awesome they do nails.

OLD REVIEW: There are not a lot of tanning salon's out here in east Gilbert so I was really happy when this one opened! They are very relaxed and friendly and have the best discounts all the time if u are connected with them through social media! The unlimited spray tan is what keeps me there! The only downfall is that they are not always stocked up with everything like baby wipes and that extra stuff. With the good deals they have though it is not a big deal and usually if you ask they have more in the back. I love to be tan!  :)  UPDATE: Too expensive for what they offer and always out of things! Switched back to my old place all the way in Ahwatukee.

I've been going to coffee rush for about 10 years. For how busy they always are they most definitely needed this new location. They honestly have the best drinks for adults and kids. Anything you desire in a drink they can serve. Not only are the drinks amazing but the atmosphere is such a good hang out spot. There are a lot of students and business people who like to meet you here to study. After all, they do have Wi-Fi! This place will not let you down. My recommendations are: iced mocha, half sweet passion fruit green tea, raspberry lemon black tea, or a black and white all black and loaded. Mmmm!

This place is pretty much the same exact thing as paradise bakery but better quality... Wildflower is a different style and definitely my favorite for a restaurant style sandwhich but this place was good too!   Ordered: Turkey bacon avocado on Crossaint  A little pricey for 10$, w/ no drink.   The turkey was my favorite part... so yummy!
