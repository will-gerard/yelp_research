Seriously the best service ever!! The cashier Lorena, didn't rush me to order, helped me choose the perfect desert for my sweet tooth and she has a friendly smile. I liked that I was able to use the restroom right away and Very Clean restroom also.

Im so sad... I booked room after finding the deal thru Hotel.com   For $100 - 2 rooms no hot water. And 3rd room made me wonder if housekeeping even cleaned....found a glass Crystal meth pipe on the floor by the foot of the bed in the morning. Thankfully, I didn't step on it with my bare feet!  Really regretting wasting money here...  Staff was somewhat friendly...But lugging Luggage to 3 different rooms with no offer from any of the staff that evening was like a slap in the face. I was only offered help by Toosti the employee who came room in the morning when I complained about finding the pipe.   No discount was offered nor did I feel that this matter really was a surprise. It's like everybody there is high on drugs or something because pretty much everybody there was emotionless. /:  To make matters worse I left my new Square card reader plugged in charging in the first room I was in when I realized it was missing I called the hotel they told me somebody else has already checked into the room so I wasn't allowed to look in the room and the next day housekeeping told me that they didn't find anything. I stop by the hotel in person before leaving Phoenix just to see if maybe someone overlooked it or if they would even allow me to look in the room myself and was still not allowed to look into the room I was told then that nobody had rented the room because they had to fix the problem with the hot water heater in that specific room so basically that means someone's that work there stole a $30 SquareUp card reader. When I showed a calm demeanor even though I was upset about the situation in repeated several times to the front desk person that I was very unhappy that I felt like I wasted money staying there and it was a bad experience he did not even tried to apologize to me, nothing... it was totally unprofessional. Total lack of hospitality.
