I honestly wish the employees, (men and women), at this location were as customer-oriented and friendly as the Ulta employees in the east valley. I specifically commend the employees & their customer service at the Tempe Marketplace and Chandler locations. There is a drastic difference between going to an Ulta in Tempe and Chandler, for instance, compared to this one. In the east valley locations, all of the customers are genuinely welcomed and greeted once you enter the store, and all associates make eye contact and smile with you. None of these behaviors are demonstrated at the Goodyear store. Each time I walk in here, I am never greeted, and I notice the employees do not show their appreciation to the customers. I truly want to avoid going to this location because of the lack of service and friendliness here. Most importantly, I do not feel valued at all as a customer here.   The ladies come off as total snobs.

I've gone here several times to have them check out my brakes. After 3 separate visits, the brakes would go back to screeching, and there is something definitely wrong with my car. What really did it for me though, was how the guys would call me 4 times, and leave 3 voicemails telling me to pick up my car in one day! It was SO annoying!! One call was honestly enough.    They were closing at 4 pm on a Saturday, so by them constantly calling me, it seemed like they were in a rush to get out of work. I am Their customer giving Them business. On top of that, I had a vital project to do for work and was busy, also trying to enjoy limited time with my family!  I agree with another reviewer, "Their quality of work is not up to par at all." That was my last visit, and I will try Sears and my own dealership. My money and time was wasted here.

Really great place, with very friendly owners/workers!   The food is really good; I've had the tuna croissant sandwich, and I really enjoyed it. My boyfriend has gotten the bagel pastrami sandwich several times, and we've tried the buttermilk donuts, chocolate donut, and apple filled bear claw!   The donuts were delicious. I would definitely recommend stopping by to this place!
