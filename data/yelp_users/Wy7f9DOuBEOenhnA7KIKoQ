Last night was my first time in The Little Theater which is part of Phoenix Theater.  I didn't see it on the list so I'm reviewing it here.   We saw Reefer Madness the musical!  It was awesome!  I couldn't stop laughing.  The sound of the theater was excellent!   It was definitely small and the seats very uncomfortable.  They had snacks out during intermission.  We bought two water bottles and I was happy to see them put a box out for recycling the water bottles and the soda cans.  They also had a box out for recycling the programs once the play finished.   I will definitely see another play here!

Super yummy.  I've only been here once, it seems all the other times I tried to go, they were closed... bummer.   I had Pad Thai and crab puffs... both amazing.  Keep wanting to go back... hopefully I get the chance soon. Gary and I need to compare their crab puffs with our other favorite crab puffs so we can pick a personal favorite crab puff in Phoenix.

Always a gallery I hit.  Great space, always interesting art.    I've known many of the artists over the years and have seen practically every exhibit.

I've driven by this place numerous times, but it wasn't until Memorial day that I finally found out what it was.  I was taking a photo of their corona beer bottle flags outside for an exhibit I'm in and needed to know the address of the location.  I opened the door to go inside and was totally blown away.  I had no idea that it was a restaurant/bakery/market.  I got my address and we left.   Well this past week we went back and I'm totally glad we did.  I had the fajitas and Gary had the Mexican pizza.  His pizza was huge, way too big to finish.  My fajitas were delish!  They had a beef jerky kinda taste and I liked that.  I did not like the beans... they were bland and tasted funny.  The best part was dessert.  We always get more than a few to try.  We tried an apple empanada, a banana cream empanada, a stuffed churro and a coconut macaroon.  I did not like the empanadas and I think Gary would agree. They were boring and flavorless.  The stuffed churro rocked!  Gary only let me have a few bites, so I want to go back for more.  The coconut macaroon was awesome!  It was coconutty, slightly oily, chewy on the inside, crunchy on top.... AND ORANGE?  not sure why it was orange but it sure was good!  I love the way it's painted inside, super colorful with different Mexican scenes muraled on to the walls.

This place is crazy!  I enjoy the eclectic events they have and watching theater in the back yard.    It's such a gorgeous house in not always a very nice neighborhood.

Yumm-o!  I love this place!  We eat here a lot.  I always get the ribs... and mix it up between the potato salad and the cole slaw.  The only thing I don't really like is sometimes they put too much pepper or something in their potato salad and cole slaw.  I'm not sure what that flavor is, but when there is too much, it ruins it for me.   But since I don't go there for potato salad and cole slaw, I'm pretty happy with the place, plus it's within walking distance from my apt.

Oh Rhythm Room, how I adore thee!  I have seen some of the greatest Blues legends play here and have never been disappointed.   Whenever The Rhythm Room All-stars play, I definitely try to make it.  They are rockin'.    I dig the dancing, the bbq (mmmmmm)  and I enjoy when the f*ck the police guy is roller skating on the dance floor!  I do recommend getting there early if you want a table and a chair.  For bands I really want to see I get there before they open, get in line, get a table, then someone in my party goes to grab us some bbq and we start drinking and eating and waiting for the music to start!    I always have a great time here!  And now that you can't smoke it's even better!

Pretty tasty.  Went here for a wedding rehearsal dinner.  I had heard of this place, but had never eaten there.  Since it was a wedding rehearsal dinner, they had a little of everything on our plates, so it was a fun way to try out the restaurant.   I'd like to go back and see the menu and order something that strikes my fancy!

If you need it, you'll probably find it here!  I was looking for dress/clothing/girly cookie cutters and this was the only place I found them!  Well I looked online but wasn't going to drop $40 for 4 cookie cutters.

If you read my reviews you will know that I LOVE PIZZA!!!!!  This is one of my favorite pizza places in town.  I just can't complain.  I get the same toppings as I always get:  extra cheese, black olives, mushrooms and artichokes and it's always perfect!  Totally reminds me of getting a slice in NYC.  It's even better cold the next morning!

I like the atmosphere here.  I have a different experience each time I eat here.  Not always the best service.  Also sometimes items I get that are not spicy, are spicy.... and I don't dig spicy.  My boyfriend did eat a piece of squid for me!!!  That is my best memory of Zen 32.  I'm not sure he actually chewed or tasted it, but he did put it in his mouth!

I enjoyed a wonderful pizza here last night.  My toppings included black olives, mushrooms and artichokes.  My boyfriend enjoyed the baked ziti.   We have been driving past this place forever and always want to stop in. Last night when we were decided what to do for dinner I said, let's have pizza and let's look on Yelp for a recommendation.  We decided that Slice of Sicily would be our choice based on closeness to our apartment and the good reviews it received.      We drive up and get a spot right in front!  Hooray for good luck!  There were only two people eating inside so we picked out a table and took a seat.  The tables were all red and white checkered and the walls full of Italian maps and posters.  The west wall was an interesting mural of an Italian landscape with bare trees and sunflowers.  The decor reminded me of how much I missed Italy.   We took a look at the menu, ordered and looked on the huge map of Italy next to us.  I asked Gary if he knew where I was born... he knew it was up north.  So I showed him, I also showed him the placed I lived in Italy and the place we are going to retire too.  He always laughs when I say that.  He doesn't know how serious I am!  Our waitress was nice and between her and the owner we got everything we needed.  The owner's family is from Sicily, but her mother was born in the states.    Our food was fantastic.  I no longer need to drive all the way to NYPD for New York Style Pizza, I can drive up the street to Slice of Sicily.  There was a nice steady stream of people in and out of the restaurant.  They do many to go orders.  They had many regulars.  We will definitely be regulars.   I would have given this place 5 stars but when we ordered two canolli's they went back to grab them and came out empty  handed.  They unfortunately were out of canolli batter.  We were a little disappointed but said we'd be back for more pizza and canolli another time.  I definitely recommend this restaurant if you like family owned pizza places and great New York style pizza.   I hope this review is beyond satisfactory to those who take this site way way way too seriously.  I tried to write a few more paragraphs, but there wasn't anything left for me to cover.

We chose this place for breakfast this morning because of the wonderful reviews on yelp.  I was certain it was going to be one of my new favorite places.   We entered into a brightly painted orange restaurant and stood at the hostess stand for a few minutes waiting for the hostess to finish flirting with the server and notice us.  She clearly didn't want to be there and could care less where we sat, so opted for the table in the window.    We sat and waited and waited and waited.  Tables that were sat after us already had their drinks and they were not busy.  Finally I tried to get the attention of the hostess who was standing half asleep at the hostess stand, mouth open wide, eyes half closed.  A few minutes later we finally had a server.  Our server was not very friendly.  I don't even think she said good morning.  We ordered.  Tables sat after us already got their food and we finally got our drinks.  She bought out 2 cups of coffee, but I did not order coffee so I made her take that back.   Our food finally arrived.  We ordered french toast which came with strawberries, bananas and a cinnamon sauce, eggs benedict with crab cakes and two orders of country potatoes.   Breakfast was pretty good.  I enjoyed my crab cake and the cinnamon sauce on the french toast was a nice added touch.  The potatoes were not good, they had WAY too much pepper on them, I couldn't even eat them.  Gary ate a few of his after he drowned them in ketchup.  We never saw our server again.  We got a water refilled after we finished our meal.  AND THE WAIT BEGAN.  We waited and waited and waited for our check.  Tables that were sat when we finished eating had already finished their food.  We never saw our waitress. I guess we were her only table, if not I felt bad for her other tables as well.   Finally some guy brought us our check and tried to drop it off and run, I said WAIT and gave him my card and said, "If I don't give this to you now it may be 20 more minutes before we see someone again"  Because I didn't look at the bill first when he brought it back I didn't notice until after I paid that they charged me $12.05 for the eggs benedict when their menu actually said $10.50.  I didn't say anything...  I just left a sad tip.  We were there for OVER an hour, they had lots of empty tables, and we only saw our server once.  Gary and I always over tip, because he and his family owned restaurants in the Valley for 35 years.  He has spent a lot of time being a chef and serving tables.  We know that when food comes out wrong, it's probably not the servers fault, and things happen, so we still tip well.  TODAY, I felt like we were invisible and I have no idea where our server disappeared to for the hour.    We drove by Over Easy, La Grande Orange and IHOP to try this place.  We probably will not be back... unless we decide to give it a second try on jazz night... I do love jazz.

Super Yum!  We were on our way to a lecture on Art Appraising and I wanted Hawaiian food, so I looked up a place near where we were going and found Aloha Kitchen.   Gary had been there numerous times before and said it sounded it good to him, so we went!  We shared won tons, and ordered chicken teriyaki and bulgoki and had 2 pineapple orange juices.   Everything was really super yummy!  Our dishes also came with macaroni-potato salad which was delish!   AND!  They have a recycling bin for the juice cans! yay!  I'd definitely hit this place up again if I were in the area.

SO GOOD!  I love this place!  They have fantastic pasta and sauces!  Both the tomato and alfredo are amazing.   My favorite item on the menu is their stuffed peppers and it comes with a side of pasta, so it's the perfect lunch.  I go here about 3 times a month for lunch... and have for the last year!  The family that owns the restaurant is super nice too... and they have a cute waiter that my friends like to look at when we go here.  Gotta love Italian men!

eh.  not someplace I would CHOOSE to go to ever again.  We tried it out a few times, as it was close to our gallery when we had it.  I always expected something great and never got it.    Also, the service was never good and they always either messed up Gary's order or brought him out something completely different.

Oh!  I'm a little jealous that this was a yelp event!  Gary and I also saw The Clean House.  It was superb!  The acting was terrific.  The characters were well written.  I especially loved the sister character.  The Portuguese jokes were funny even if I couldn't understand them.  AND The stage was  brilliant, very well done.   Make sure to check out the art gallery upstairs.  They change their exhibits every few months.  I'm actually exhibiting right now!

I love this place.  I especially love it on Tuesdays when it's free.   I have been to many lectures, openings and films at the Museum and am always fascinated.    The changing photography exhibit is always fantastic.  The fashion room is one of my favorite features.  BUT my favorite piece is the firefly installation.  I could seriously live in that room. I take everyone I know and everyone is always as mesmerized as I am, and I have seen it many times.  I love the new contemporary wing of the museum.  I also love the glass boxes on the sides of the building.  One time we were there during a thunderstorm and sat in the glass box and watched the lightening.  It was perfect!    The museum always makes me happy.

I love Halloween!  Each year I either make my costume or use pieces from my wardrobe.  When I was growing up each of my costumes were made by my grandma.  I had never bought a costume until this year.   I attempted to make a flapper dress out of film strips because I wanted to tote a recycled costume but that never happened.  I couldn't figure out how to do it so it would look nice.   We had many exciting things happening the weekend before Halloween and for the night of, so I really really really wanted a costume.  I looked online, but I never buy clothes online.  I must see how it looks on me.   SO! We headed to Easley's!  What a super fun experience.  It was definitely packed, but it was a few days before Halloween, so that was expected.  I wanted matching costumes. Gary is always Young Dr. McCoy from Star Trek and I did not want to be a Star Trek girl...   So we hunted and tried and hunted and tried more costumes on.    We eventually decided to be Batman and Batgirl.   We looked super cute!    I had a great experience finding a costume.  I even still wear my gloves and mask around the house!

Best Dive Bar in Phoenix!  That's all I have to say!  But since everyone knows I always have much much much more to say.... This bar has the best juke box, the bouncer on the weekends is the former commercial stunt double for Charles Barkley, they make me free(!)  Shirley Temples when I'm the DD or just not in the mood to drink.  My night never ends with this bar, we always seem to meet new people and end up at some random house party afterwards.  I always know people in the bar too, which is nice!  So if I don't know where anyone is, I'll just head to the Bikini Lounge and find someone to hang out with!  One night these two guys who just got out of jail were there, it was a slow weeknight and we befriended them.  They told us stories for hours.  I never wanted to go jail before, but after their stories I definitely never ever want to go to jail.

One of my very favorite places in downtown Phoenix.  I have see my favorite bands play here numerous time, have enjoyed an ice cream in the summer and warm coffee in the winter.  I have a collection of awesome black and white photo booth strips.  I have shown work in this gallery and have seen the work of many friends hang on the wall.   I have been on their stage for Grand Ave Tonight, the most important talk show of our times.    I have gone to a swap-o-rama-rama and was able to give my clothes a new home.   The memories of The Trunk Space go on and on and on and on!!!!  I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!

Went with a group of friends on Saturday night.  Yes, there was a huge book of songs.    It was my first time singing karaoke... which means I needed a lot of drinks in me.  They kept the martinis coming, but I can't tell you if they were good or not, because I was pretty drunk.  We ordered food too, but I was too excited to sing to eat any of it.  But it mostly disappeared, so it must of been okay.   I put 4 songs on my piece of paper, but was only called on once in the 4 hours we were there.  They said there was a rotation, but others got to sing more than a few times and everyone in my group only got to sing once.  I felt like they were giving the 'regulars' more songs.    Also, it was a Saturday night and the 'regulars' were all singing country songs and showtunes.  I was practicing all week, I wanted to SING!!!! And their slow songs were boring me.  So hopefully there are other options in the valley for Karaoke, it did feel pretty awesome singing and dancing on the stage, in a drunken stupor and I'd like to do it again sometime.   If I end up here again, perhaps I will change my review, but I'll never go here again on a Saturday night.

Ready for an out of this world experience?  Then head to Vision Quest, a bookstore of the metaphysical realm (and my personal favorite bookstore in Phoenix or I guess I should say Scottsdale).  I go here a few times a month, sometimes looking for something in particular, and other times just to look for something that catches my fancy.   If you're looking for books on self help, angels, feng shui, aliens, iridology, astrology, love....  you'll find it here.  Their selection is wonderful and if they don't have it they can special order it for you.   BUT!  The best part of the bookstore is the AURA PHOTO BOOTH!!!!! Last month Gary and I started a monthly project of one aura photograph a month.  Our first aura readings were incredible (I am full of love and he is a natural healer).  Today we went for our second photo and Sheila (my personal favorite aura reader) told Gary he would have a new job in 4-8 weeks (thankgoodness) and that I need to rest and get better (I've been sick all week).  Those are just a few of the personal details your aura can tell you.  It's a fascinating experience.  Every day there are readings and interesting people selling their craft/art to you.  We have purchased different items from time to time to add to our meditation section of our home.  We've sat and listened to spiritual music while the composer told us how he felt when recording the piece.    They have classes and workshops throughout the month all well priced.  You can learn Reiki, how to meditate, how to photograph ghosts ect.    It's an experience that if you let it, will transform you.  Walking into the store has an immediate effect on your energy.  Do visit them and experience it for yourself!

Disgusting.  I would never eat here again.  Gary and I went to Mill on Sunday.  We wanted to go to the bookstore and to try someplace new.   When we walked in, he said, let's go, I don't want to eat here.  But I said, no, let's give it a chance, it's always packed on the weekends.    I ordered a cheeseburger with onion rings...  they were out of onion rings and lettuce... so I ended up with a cheeseburger and cheese fries.  Gary had the Bacon, egg and cheese sandwich and chilli cheese fries.   We got our food, the hamburger bun was old, stale, rock hard... which pretty much ruined the whole sandwich.  The cheese on my cheese fries was not melted.  They forgot the tomato in Gary's sandwich.  The guy at the counter didn't understand English and I couldn't understand him, so ordering was quite the complicated procedure.    A few hours later my stomach was hurting so much.  I thought I was going to die... and spent the night throwing up.  I will never eat here again, and I may even listen to Gary when he says let's go some place else.

I have been to Lux many times for meetings, to kill time, to read a book, to get some coffee before I head to my downtown destination...  I hadn't been in a while and we had some extra time before the play started, so we headed to lux for an Iced Americano, a strawberry italian soda and 2 cupcakes... and then 2 more cupcakes.  The drinks were great and cupcakes... perfect!  I read my book and he did his crossword puzzle and we hung out for an hour and a half.  They were playing Hot Hot Heat and the paintings on the walls were very good.    I need to try to get over here more often.

Excellent!  Sometimes a little noisy.  Sometimes a wait.   I pretty much always get a lettuce wrap cheeseburger, their bread is too big AND sweet potato fries!  I love how the fries come out in little shopping carts.    It was the first restaurant I had been too after living in NYC that reminded me of NYC!  That was one of reasons we kept going back.  And now they have cupcakes too!  Or just head across the street for gelato!

This is my favorite place to get Chinese food.  It's the only Chinese restaurant without mystery meat. Also the meat is not fried to death.  I LOVE the Lemon Chicken and the crab puffs.  Love love love the crab puffs.   The service is always slow, but since we know that we factor that into our dinner.

I am a pizza lover!  I could eat pizza every day for lunch and for dinner!  This is one of my favorite pizza places in town!  I bring all out of town guests here and frequent the place as often as I can.   I always get the capriccoisa pizza (not sure if I spelled that right), but it has olives, proscuitto and mushrooms!    AND I always get a crepe for dessert!  My personal favorite is strawberry and nutella.  To die for!

Best lettuce wraps I've ever had.  Sweet and Salty, super good! Great mojitos!  One of the only places I will order mojitos.    Had a party on the patio once and that was super fun.  Although one time I went there with some friends in the middle of the summer and their air conditioning wasn't working... we stayed because the bar was a little cooler, but that was agonizing...

I've eaten here about 6 or 7 times.  It's always a pleasant and delicious experience.  I'm an on again, off again vegetarian and on Friday afternoon when my boyfriend told me he decided to become vegetarian, I couldn't have been more excited!  The crazy thing is that on Wednesday I had decided the same thing without telling him.  He always makes fun of me when I decide to go veggie.  BUT now with him doing it as well, it will be a breeze!  Now if only I could commit to being a raw foodist for longer than a month at a time... hmmmmm.....  On Saturday morning I said let's go to Mandala Tea Room to celebrate our first day of being vegetarians together.  So we did!  I ordered the blue corn pancakes with raspberries and a side of tempeh bacon.  He ordered the BLT.  Both dishes were scrumptious.  They accidentally brought him out a salad, so that nice for him.  He ate all my bacon, and then ordered another plate, and only gave me once piece from that order. ha!  The ginger iced tea of the day was refreshing.  My favorite is when they have a coconut iced tea.    We debated between the tiramisu or the the blueberry/raspberry cake.  Our adorable waitress asked us if we wanted sinful or playful.  So we went playful with the blueberry/raspberry cake.   It was also nice that they were playing our current favorite album, In Rainbows, by Radiohead.  A day hasn't gone by since we got the cd this fall that we haven't listened to it.    This is one of those restaurants that I could eat at every single day and be super happy!

So Yummy!  and the decor is awesome!!!  Though it can get pretty loud.   This restaurant was my first experience eating Fried Ice Cream!  All I can say is wow!  What a creation!  Drizzled with a little honey and I'm in heaven.   Their fajitas are so good and the grilled leeks they include are also super good.  I've never had fajitas with grilled leeks before.  I also LOVE their quesadilla.    Just remember they are CLOSED on Mondays.  I seem to always forget that and must crave Mexican on Mondays because every time we pull up on a Monday we both go awwwww in unison.

One of my favorite hotels in Phoenix.  I worked there for a year and have stayed there a few times as well.  Love the boutique feel, the colors, the furniture, the great atmosphere, the art, the pool, the rooftop....  I have been to fashion shows here and spent the most awesome new years eve ever here.  I have gotten guys to get naked and jump in the pool, I have done naughty dirty things in the hallways!  I have met numerous celebrities here.  I hung out with Cheech from Cheech and Chong at the bar.  I have been to magazine launches and birthday parties.....  Every time I go in there something new and exciting has happened or changed!    I love this place and I love Ben too!  I hope it is around forever!

I didn't even know I could yelp about a post office!  I live across the street from this post office and am quite the regular here.  I am obsessed with sending mail, so I'm always in need of stamps and special two day deliveries to cheer friends up!  I LOVE this post office.  I think someone else said those exact words, but seriously, this is the most amazing post office in the world.  Every single person that works there is incredibly helpful and kind.  They are always smiling and have become my friends.  Yes, I am friends with post office workers... but once you use this post office, you'll want to be friends with them too.   If I ever moved out of this neighborhood, I would go out of my way to continue using this post office!

I only give it two stars because of the cool building.  This restaurant is in the original terminal of the Phoenix Air Port.  While you're eating you're actually watching planes take off and land, and that is pretty cool.   Their food is terrible.  I heard that one time they made a mistake while filling the salt shakers and instead filled them with MSG!!! I know, right, disgusting.

Pretty good.  I've been here a few times.  The mac and cheese is pretty tasty.  I had a puffy pastry thing with mozzarella cheese and proscuitto.  I would not order that again.  I'm particular with my proscuitto and this was not Proscuitto di Parma... it was cheep and salty... which made my whole meal salty....  I've tried their mozzarella and tomato sandwich once and that was great... and their Cesar salad is pretty good too.  I like the inside of the restaurant... and they have since lowered the music which is nice.

NEVER EVER EAT HERE!  YOU MIGHT DIE!!!!!!! It is so disgusting.  The food tastes like grease and the omlette was scary.  A FLY was in my apple juice.. A FLY!!!!!!!!  It reaks of smoke and is just plain nasty.  The only good think about it is the sign.  If there were zero stars I would give it zero stars.    And I like diners.  My boyfriend and hunt them out in other cities.

We went here today to watch the final game of the Euro Cup, Germany against Spain... unfortunately Spain won and Germany didn't score any goals.  I would have liked to see the crowd get out of control.   It was packed, and we found a table but couldn't see the game and we wanted to eat... so after looking around, I found a corner that our table would fit in perfectly. We would be able to see the game and wouldn't be blocking anyone else, and I asked if we could move and they said yes!  That definitely scored points for them..  BECAUSE we missed the first half of the game!!!!  They had dish network and none of the channels were working!  It was soooooo annoying.  We ordered and ate and kept calling my mom and grandma who were giving us updates so we could update everyone else too.   We had a pretzel with beer cheese sauce and a brat burger, two bloody mary's, creme brulee and apple strudel.  The pretzel was fantastic, perfect, and we had plenty of left over cheese sauce for dipping fries and our brat burger in!  Gary really liked the brat burger, it was just okay to me.  He also really liked his two bloody mary's, I never liked them so I had a sip and drank a lot of water after that sip. Our dessert was good. It came with real whipped cream so that was nice.   Gary is telling me from the kitchen to say the creme brulee was not the best but it was really good, he said it was done right.  He also wants to make sure everyone knows that he was very happy with the generous portion of cheese sauce.  He hates it when he has left over food and no more dipping sauces.  Gary is also German so he fit right in, ha!  We had been here before when it was the German Corner.  His family used to travel from Gilbert just to buy the meats in the German grocery store, and today it looked it like it wasn't there anymore.  I don't really like head cheese so I wasn't dying to go in there... but I didn't notice a door leading to the store anymore.  I definitely want to go back, when there is a polka band!

LOVE LOVE LOVE riding my bike through here.  Especially on our way back, with all the down hills!!!!  It's like a roller coaster but better!!!!  I also drive through here every morning to get to work, so that is a nice, relaxing, pretty way to start my day.

I love The Clarendon Hotel and the restaurant was great!  I'll always have a very special place in my hear for this hotel but that won't change my opinion on the restaurant.   We started with crab cakes that were terrific and I had ordered a sandwich that came with really cool potatoes.   I did like the potatoes better than the sandwich.  My dad had the same thing as me and he loved it.  My mom had a steak and potato salad and she really liked it.  My boyfriend ordered the mac and cheese and he loved it and so did I.   I wasn't feeling super good that day or I would have ordered a martini and dessert, so I'll have to go back.    Also, the rooftop of this hotel is rockin' with views, ambiance and dj's.  Definitely check it out one evening, it's a great place to have a drink with friends.  And the pool is the best pool in Phoenix!

GORGEOUS STREET!!!!!  So much to walk down or bike ride and day dream.  We used to live near here and you could tell when the Suns players were home and when they weren't.  All the Escalades were there when they were in town, and it was dead when they weren't.  Two of the Suns players live across the street from each other.  We even ran into Shawn Marion in the gas station.

I tried going to this place 3 times before I found it open.  Then I found out that it changed owners and now has regular hours.   I only had the falafel and they were super delicious.  They bake them instead of fry them!!  So I'll definitely be back for more!  Also, David, the owner is super nice and has the most gorgeous eyes.....

Went here last Thursday for hair cut.  I actually looked on Yelp to see which place was getting some hot reviews and gave them a call.   I'd also been meaning to check out Gold Mine (Gold Lion re-opened as Gold Mine inside the salon).  The interior was a little rough and edgy, but I liked it!  Lots of graffiti, an old car was attached to the wall, my hairdresser said that the place gets moved around a lot.  She also said that they often have DJ's in there, which sounds pretty cool to me, but luckily they were playing a mix of Muse, Interpol, and Coldplay!  I am growing my hair to my booty so I can donate it and help cancer patients have nice heads of hair while they are going through treatment.  My mom had breast cancer, but this summer is her two year cancer free mark!  Yay!  So basically I needed a trim, some style and had been contemplating bangs for a while...  got the bangs, got a fantastic trim, not too much off the ends but it's super healthy now!  I'm pretty sure her name was Samantha (I knew I should have written this last week), but she was lovely to chat with.  AND when I told her I was going on a romantic date to a jazz lounge with boyfriend who was sleeping in one of their chairs, she gave me a fantastic do... pinned up  with big curls!  I looked great!  I will be going back... soon... I'm sure my bangs will need a trim in a few weeks!

I cannot wait to go back here again on a Friday night, specifically at 9:30 which is when I heard they do their fancy ice machete show.   We (me and 5 of my friends) spent a lovely Sunday afternoon at Roka Akor.  It was the launch of the hottest new beauty magazine, Runway. It's international but housed in Scottsdale and the Fashion Director is my friend Susan Di Staulo.  They had two fashion shows in the main dinning room featuring clothing from local boutiques.   They brought samples to our table all afternoon and everything I tried was fabulous. The calamari was to die for! It was some of the best calamari I've ever had. I'll admit I like my calamari lightly battered with no added zing, and lots of lemon. This calamari had some subtle spices added, I couldn't quite figure out what the flavors were but it was delicious. Definitely not too much, AND they were lightly battered!   The scallops were excellent and so was the spicy tuna roll.  The decor of the restaurant was sleek, modern and eco friendly. Their bathrooms were amazing and had two different flushing buttons. My friends and I assumed they were for #1 and #2... save water with #1...?  The colors of the restaurant were warm and inviting and the drinks were excellent! We had bellini's with saki and a mixed berry juice. So wonderful. We also had saki and white wine...  Like I started this review off, I cannot wait to go back!!

Gary and I went here last night.   Everything was quite tasty.  We ordered Shepard's Pie, Ruben Sandwich with coleslaw and a side of chips.  OH, and some light colored fruity beer that was on tap.  I had a sip, it was beer.  Gary enjoyed it, he drank it all.    My favorite thing was the coleslaw, it was fantastic!  Leafy, a nice celery taste and the dressing was good too.  I also enjoyed the chips! I like potato wedges better than fries and random pieces were tart, which I liked.  The asparagus that came with the Shepard's Pie were fantastic!  The last restaurant we had asparagus, they were tough and not really edible, but these were tasty!  I liked the atmosphere of the restaurant too.  Didn't know they had a juke box until after we finished eating.  Next time I'll pick a few songs!

One of my favorite bars in Phoenix!  How could you not LOVE this place!  It's so awesome inside!  Gary and I were bike riding downtown a few months ago and stopped inside for a little day drinking and a rest.  They did such a wonderful job making it look like the old location.  My first trip to Chez Nouz were with out of town friends from Chicago.  I had just moved here and they wanted to visit and I didn't know where to take them.  We had dinner somewhere downtown and we asked where we should go.  This was one of the places she recommended.  We were super happy we went.    It was the best martini I had since leaving Chicago.  We got totally wasted, and I'm not actually sure how we made it home!  That's how great of a time we had.  And I've been going ever since.

We went to Chandler to check out some art galleries one evening and as soon as we walked by this place we had the sudden urge for sugar!!  I had the Death by Chocolate Cake and Gary had the Apple Pie with ice cream.  I had a Vanilla Coconut ice tea and Gary had a MetropliTini - a martini made with teas and alcohol in a super funky martini glass.   The desserts were fantastic!  My cake was so rich I could not finish the huge chocolaty goodness that was on my plate.  Gary loved his apple pie and his martini even more.   It's also such a cute little place and if we're ever in Chandler again, we'll definitely be stopping here for some tea and desserts!

Love this place!  I've been twice but each experience was excellent!  I love sitting at the counter, reading the newspaper and enjoying whatever it is  that I ordered.  I love their french toast!  Super yum!    Their counter has those retro boomerangs on it.  You can sit there and watch the cooks in the kitchen, that is always fun for me.  They have a cute covered patio, but I have never sat on it yet.  We really like counters if the restaurant has one.   I also love that it's super close to my apartment.

I review a lot of pizza places because pizza is my favorite food, especially wood fire pizza.    After we went to a lovely afternoon fashion show the 6 of us decided we needed some food to dilute all the alcohol we consumed.  I drive by this place on my way home from work every day so I suggested it.   Only one other table was occupied when we arrived, which was probably a good thing since we were a little loud.  Gary and I both had pizza, he a potato and gorgonzola (which I did not try because I think gorgonzola is terrible).  He loved it and ate every last bite.   I had the margherita pizza with fresh mozzarella, basil and added prosciutto.  Their tomato sauce was sweet and smooth and just wonderful!  The pizza crust was charred just the right amount and had those pockets of air dough that I love tearing apart (or sticking my finger into).  Gary had a vodka martini and he said it was smooth and potent, a winning combination.   This place will definitely be one of my revolving pizza choices.

We stopped by here for drinks one evening after pizza at Humble Pie.  Gary and I were entertaining a French guest.    It's pretty snazzy inside!  We only had drinks, but I'll definitely be back for dinner.   We went specifically for absinthe.  Our awesome bartender, the bald guy from Seattle (I can't believe I forgot his name), gave us quite the informative lesson on the lovely absinthe.  Then, we learned more from the manager...  It was the first time either of us had had it.  They have three kinds, that were equally amazing.  When they were having their second glass, I decided to have a drink called 'Hemingway's Muse', champagne and a shot of absinthe. It was heavenly.  Gary and  I are now HUGE fans of absinthe.  We went out and bought a bottle the next day.  We've made all sorts of interesting concoctions with it, including an absinthe milkshake! ha!  We made friends with everyone around us... and everyone was also drinking absinthe!!!  Go try it, and make sure to sign the book!

We've been here four times in less than 2 months I have a feeling we will go here many, many, many more times.  It's one of my new favorite places in Scottsdale.   I had the mushroom quiche (each time) obviously delicious if I ordered it 4 times in a row.  I usually like to try new things the first few times I go to a restaurant and then settle in on my favorite items but... each time I go, I remember how amazing the quiche was, and just order it again.  It comes with a salad and super yummy vinaigrette.  I always loved that about European restaurants, they serve salad with their egg dishes instead of potatoes. The crust on the quiche is amazing and I love that it comes out square instead of pie shaped so I get yummy crust with over half my bites!  Gary has gotten the 4 cheese quiche 3 times and an omlette the other time. He says it's the best 4 cheese quiche he's ever had.  The most amazing part of the restaurant is their pastry selection!  Oh My Gosh, SO incredible!  and SO Delicious!  We have now tried four, five, six (?) different pastries.   The raspberry rose pastry is wonderful and so fresh tasting, like a flower garden.  The 3 chocolate parfait pastry was not my favorite.  When I looked at it I thought the chocolate layers were going to be creamy and soft and they were hard and cold, it was good, but I wouldn't get it again.  The French Brest is praline between two yummy puff pastry cookies.  That was delicious, very sweet, very creamy, melted in my mouth.  AND my favorite was the French Meringue. I've gotten that one twice.  It was spectacular, super sweet, all white, a meringue that was heavenly and a cream frosting that was out of this world!  I'll have to brush up on my French pastry terminology.  They were a little slow getting to us on our second visit and they gave us a bag of cookies for the wait!  I thought that was nice of them and totally unexpected.  The decor is grey and pink with lots of framed fashion photos.  The owners are there working the tables, asking what their customers thought and if they need anything.  That is always a good sign to me, caring owners... with French accents, witch makes my experience all the better.  If you have not been here yet!  GO! GO! GO!

I took my family here last night.  Interesting little place.  I definitely like the decor, but how could you not!  Tie-dye, hippie posters, psychedelic designs...    We started with the potato skins, pretty tasty.  Then we ordered 4 hamburgers and 2 hot dogs.  Gary and I had hot dogs, and they were delish.  It could be that they were delish because they just were or it could be because I haven't had a hot dog in ages!  Either way we were all happy with our dinner  AND the price!  Super cheep!  The owner told us they had been open for 80 days as of yesterday and that they make the hamburgers and the all beef hot dogs there.  The place was hopping too.  Lots of to-go orders, the front patio was packed and we sat on the back patio.  A mix of people, locals and business men, even a BMW motorcycle group in suits.  We definitely would go back if we were in the neighborhood.

Checked out this place over the weekend.  I wanted to sit outside and people watch over good food, at a NEW restaurant.  We always go to our few favorites and I wanted an excuse to Yelp!  We went to Mill Ave and settled on La Bocca.  First off I love the name, since it's almost like my last name!    We sat outside until we were too cold and instead took a table in the window inside so we could still people watch.  We ordered two pizzas:  The Margherita and some crazy named pizza with bechamel sauce, bacon and grilled onions.  Both were really good.  I only like bacon sometimes and wasn't in a bacon mood that day so I polished off the Margherita while Gary ate the crazy named bacon pizza.    The restaurant is super cute inside too.  You know, I think I had some drinks there on Halloween Night....   It's pretty close to our house so I'm sure we'll be going back there again sometime soon.  I'm always in the mood for pizza!

Best Vintage Store in Phoenix!  Hands down!    I never walk out of this store without something fabulous!  My two most recent purchases were a set of vintage 50's gold cat eye glasses sweater pins and a 60's yellow/orange/white disk bracelet!    The sweater pins are my new favorite accessory!  I wear black cat eye glasses so they were truly a fitting purchase.   My other favorite two purchases from this store are hats!  I adore vintage hats, I have many of them!  I wear them all the time.  I found two at this store that I didn't have any like, which is rare.  One was green with a beautiful green veil and leaves and flowers on top.  The other is black and white pocadot with a red flower.   Anyway... this store has everything!  A great selection of vintage clothing, awesome earrings and necklaces, a great selection of vintage wear for men, furniture, knick knacks... just the most amazing vintage finds in Phoenix!    I also love that owner is so knowledgeable in vintage items!  She also gave me a secret: how to repair the delicate veils on vintage hats!  A secret I have used more than once since she gave it to me!

This is my new favorite place in Scottsdale!  (I know, I say that a lot when I try someplace new, but I just get so excited)  Gary and I went here on Thursday to listen to some jazz, eat some Italian food, have a few drinks and dessert.  I want to go here every night!  The food was incredible!  He didn't know what to get so I ordered for the both of us.  We had the Risotto with porcini mushrooms, fresh baby artichokes and parmigiano cheese and the Tagliatelle, homemade spinach infused egg noodle with veal and tomato sauce. Both dishes were out of this world, but the Tagliatelle was better, the sauce was rich and smooth.  The risotto was creamy and every bite was paired with a mushroom or artichoke.   So the best part of this place was the atmosphere and the live jazz.  The lounge is a dark red with chocolate leather couches, low, low, low lighting.  Very Sexy.  Very Romantic. AND it was complete with a boy from Brooklyn as our server, Dennis. He lived in Bay Ridge!  I lived in Bay Ridge!  Awwww, Brooklyn!  Gary had two martinis, I forget what kind, but it was sweet and tasty.  We also ordered creme brulee, and that was just okay. I mean, it was good, but the tops were caramelized and refrigerated.  We like ours done on the spot, right before it's served, so you can crack the top! Next time I try the tiramisu.   They have live jazz 6 nights a week, how awesome is that! We will definitely be back!

I was disappointed with this grocery store.  I had heard so many wonderful things about it from friends that my expectations were quite high.  We tried many of the fresh and easy label and only liked the meatballs.  Their pickles taste so weird the jar is still full in my fridge.  Their olive bread had no flavor.  Their canned tuna was also super boring.  The apple fritters were dry and old. The cole slaw was terrible.  They have a very poor selection of produce. There wasn't enough heads of romaine for 3 days of juice.  We couldn't find Kale or celery.  The manager that checked us out gave us $15 worth of coupons off our grocery bill, so that was nice of him.  He raved about how good the fresh and easy brand was and even tried to convince us to trade in some of our items for the Fresh and Easy brand.  I'm glad we didn't or we would have been even more disappointed.  He also said they are known for their low prices, the lowest in the Valley so they don't accept coupons that aren't from Fresh and Easy... but that's not true.  Safeway has much better prices on their produce (and a much better selection).  I'll stick with Safeway, AJ's and Whole Foods.

Today I went to Desert Bloom and received my first facial.  IT WAS AMAZING!  I felt so fancy and pampered during, and after the facial my skin felt fresh and clean.   Natalya (the owner) is super sweet and very knowledgeable about facial products and corrective treatments.  She also carries two yummy facial product lines, pca and ilike (a Hungarian brand, new to US).  Gary also received a facial and enjoyed being pampered.  She carries tons of facial products for men.  Gary and I plan on getting facials at least once a month from now on.  I think I'd like to try a few peels as well... I want Natalya to make my skin as gorgeous as hers!!  It was a little hard to find... when you go, make sure to turn towards the left parking lot. We parked in the wrong parking lot and walked a while until we found it.

Is this what a krispy kreme doughnut is suppose to taste like?  I sure hope not....   We bought 3 kinds, the regular glazed kind, and jelly filled with apples and cinnamon and jelly filled with strawberries. I did not like any of them... they didn't even taste fresh.  I would not get doughnuts from here ever again.   Perhaps I could be persuaded to try them from another location, but one more chance is all I'll give.

This is going to be one of my new favorite places in Phoenix!  It's gorgeous inside and very hip.  I love that it's upstairs with a view of downtown Phoenix in every window.    I went last night for a birthday party!  It was my birthday too, and turns out it was another guys birthday as well, and someone else's birthday on Wednesday, so it turned into a huge birthday party.  I love that that they were playing Russ Meyer films on the tv's.    The bar is also super neat and everyone who had a camera last night were taking photos of the bar!  The owners and bar manager were mingling and getting to know their customers.  I talked with all of them and found out about some exciting things that will be happening soon at SideBar!   OHHHHH!  Plus they have absinthe, which you all know is one of my favorites!

Great Store!  Every time I go in there I wish I could buy it all!  One day... oh one day when I have a house to shop for!  I have been going to this store for at least 4 years.  It's fun to see it change.  I love the layout now.  I still love the incredible pieces they find.  I begged and begged my boyfriend to let me buy the gorgeous pink vintage couches they had in the store last year, but he would not budge on his NO...  Oh well... One day I will have room with vintage pink furniture and all vintage accessories and it will all come from this store.  I used to go in there every few months and buy new jewelry and vintage accessories, but unfortunately the last time I was in there, there was none of the to be found.  Bradford, being the nice guy that he is asked if I had checked out the store across the street... I had not, so I did and am super happy that he recommended them to me.

One of the most incredible space in downtown Phoenix.   Always a delightful experience.   This last Art Detour (2008), on the second floor I saw two ghosts.  So that was pretty awesome.  My boyfriend opened the door and then closed it and I said let's go in there.  He said there was nothing in there.  I said I saw two people walking.  I really did.  He opened the door and in the back of the room, I saw a light and two people walking.  We opened the door again, and it was pitch black and empty.  Totally freaky!
