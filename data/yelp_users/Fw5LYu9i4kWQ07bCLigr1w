I really like this place. I'm not the type to switch barbers often. But after moving, researching and trying out different places (for the last year) in downtown Phoenix, I think I've decided on Central Barber Shop.  I've had my hair cut from a few different barbers there. Roman is quick and good. I think he might be the manager, or pit boss or something...  I've also had my hairs trimmed from a gal who once asked him for advise in Russian, I think.... Anyways, she ended up doing a very good job as well. I actually prefer Roman and second the blonde gal right next to him. I've also had my hairs cut from a gentleman by the name of Boris.   My hair is always done well. Pricing is decent. And Dutch Bros Coffee is right next door. North West corner on Central & Camelback.

I really like this place. The atmosphere is nice and the good is really good. My girlfriend doesn't like their sushi. I think it's good for inexpensive sushi and a sake for lunch. There's a calamari salad that's very good. Recommended.

Doug, the manager Doug and the bartender (actually all the bar tenders) are awesome! I got off work late and I had my heart set on going here to play open mic. Well, the kitchen closes at 10pm and they have really good food, so I called in... THEY PLACED THE ORDER AND. WAITED FOR ME! I was only about 15 minutes late. Well, they literally heated it back up for me. Obviously this is inconvenient for them. But they made it seem like it was no bigs. Love this place. Good hearted people. Great good. Amazing vibe. Come to Aunt Chiladas. Cheers mate!

That awkward moment when you realise that you get what you pay for. I actually use to really like this place. Great happy hour. Good flavors on the wings. I guess the awkward part of it all is that I'm not 23 anymore and my expectations are higher than they use to be. Like tonight, for example. I placed an easy order of happy hour wings and a brew. Well... no. I got a full order. When I informed the server ( young red head with tats behind her ears and plugs) that I only ordered a small order of wings, she offered to get me a box. I figured this was so she didn't have to get management involved with the switch or what not, despite my eager suggestion. Needless to say, the evening continued. I eat one wing... literally one! A cockroach walks onto the bar. It was small and may have been a beetle, but still... ew! ! There goes my appetite!    Words of advice.  If you do decide to come to good ol' Unc' Sam's, wear protection. Serves with mediocre at best. The gals working there are 12, so I don't expect much I suppose. However,  the Peoria location is much better and cleaner ( it seems like). I'm only giving two stars because of the cheap beer and the decent wings. Not good!!! Just decent. I think the beer helps.   Long story short. If you have a party and want cheap cheapness... well then you've found... omg... an other cockroach just walked up on the bar! Are you absolutely kidding me!? Im seriously about to freak out and walk out. I don't care if I haven't paid. This is embarrassing!!! DO. NOT.  EAT. HERE!!!

I want to write a review about this specific Zipps, but more about the gal who served my girl friend Kelly and me the other day. Serena P. (her name was on the ticket and I took a pic to write this)   Serena was amazing. Her service and attentiveness was perfect. Around enough to be completely satisfied with the amount of service and subtle enough to hardly notice she's one it, 100% Just a pleasure.   Kelly was a server for years and subconsciously critiques so much about servers and service in general. To be honest, she even critiques me! She feels it's rude to ask a service to have a burger cut in half, for example. Well, Serena heard us mention Kelly and I split our meals and came back with our burger already cut! It was very thoughtful and absolutely perfect. I was then able to tell Kelly that I was right! Some servers don't mind having your burger cut in half.   Bottom line, Serena was great.  Food: If you come here, make sure to try to bleu cheese with the wings. The golden hot is so hot but has great flavor. My fave is dipping golden medium wings in golden hot and then bleu cheese. Yum! And the sweet jalapeno burger with the turkey patty. Amazingly delicious! Beware of the golden hot. A little at a time.  Drinks: If you like beer and margaritas, then you have to try the beer with a floater. We get Dos Equis floaters with a lime. They'll get you.   Love this place!

So I went out for a quick drink with some friends last night and pulled into Bootleggers. I honestly thought it was going to be some little drive bar judging from the small plaza it is located in. In fact, it even looked closed! But once inside I was very impressed. Mason jar chandelier and drink glasses. Perfect atmosphere for a smoke house. There's a window that allows you to see some of the kitchen and the wood piles used for smoking. The place smelt great but my friends and I were only there for a quick drink. That's when the bartender informed us about their signature apple pie moonshine made in house. It was pretty tasty, I gotta tell ya. But I can't wait to try a meal. Service was great. The bartender, I think his name is Mike, was great! Definitely a good experience. I'll be back to write a review about the BBQ here soon!

Oh... My... Goodness. I called to get a quote from these guys and this guy, who for some reason informed me his middle name is Eduardo, was so incredibly rude. He wouldn't tell me his name. After I got the quote I informed him I wrote it down and respectfully wanted to get a few other quotes... Standard stuff. Well, this gentleman would not let me get off the phone so I respectfully informed him I would follow up if I need their assistance and I hung up. He proceeded to call me a total of 17 times in a row while I was on the other line with an other place. I couldn't even speak to the lady in the line from the other storage place without call after call coming in. That is not good customer service. That is not sales. I don't know what that is. So rude. So disrespectful. Just absolutely crazy that they would hire someone who's like this... I give this place 0 stars if I could.

Public Cuts N Styles was good, honest business. The two barbers, David and Steven, informed me they just took over this location a few months back, but the spot was a barber shop before. Well, I gotta tell you, David hooked me up clean. My roommate actually told me about this place and these guys. I honestly use to go to Camelback Barber or Central Barber and even A&D on 10th & Camelback (most expensive). This place was way more easy going and honestly, the best bang for the buck. Highly recommended. Check them out.
