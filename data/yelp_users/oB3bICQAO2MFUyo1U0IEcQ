I love nordstrom, but not this one. Customer service is absolutely horrible!! Employees are rude and completely unhelpful.

I am in today for a nose piercing and received amazing customer service from Kevin and Matt. I am really sensitive to pain, and was scared but they made me feel incredibly comfortable and I had a great experience here because of them. I'll be back soon if I decide to get any other piercing or find new jewelry!

Great locally owned shop. There's a good variety of flavors including non-fat, dairy free, and tart options. They also have buy one get one free Thursdays, and double-punch card Tuesdays! The owner and staff and also very friendly!

I've been here twice and have throughly enjoyed my experience. The restaurant is clean and staff is very friendly. They serve you chips and salsa while you wait for your food, but our meals were ready within 10 minutes! The portion size was also  very generous.The food was tasty and the staff always checked to make sure we were happy and our drinks were filled. My only wish is that they served alcoholic beverages. I will definitely be back!

Decided to come here on a whim, and wow it was great! The burgers are stuffed and you can even customize your own burger. The prices are also amazing- got a huge chocolate milkshake with Oreos for $2.45. I only wish they had a location in Tempe!
