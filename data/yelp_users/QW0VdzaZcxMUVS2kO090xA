Take out or dine in for the bargain price of $6.15.  Obviously concessions have been made in the quality department and Mike Kwan's Golden Coin is nothing more than a cheap fill-up.   In fact, this Chinese buffet has been filling a niche of mass quantities of Cantonese style food offered on a warm buffet for decades.  Pull the couch apart, look for some loose change in the cushions, ask to borrow a dollar on your way in and you are all set to put the feed bag on - this is a cash only establishment!  It was more out of nostalgia that I stopped in to see if anything has changed in the last 25 years . . . it hasn't and that is not necessarily a bad thing, per se.  The same sweet and sour pork is being prepared, the same way (which is to say floating in gallons of sauce, only adding more flour coated pork bits when the vat is low) along with rice, noodles, vegetables, Egg Foo Young, egg rolls cut in half (as if you will take less that way) and fried chicken thighs along with a hard-to-find drumstick thrown in.  In fact there is a constant filling of the dozen or so choices on the steam table as if the staff were chumming its patrons for their own amusement - it is like a controlled ration.  Really, it is amazing to see the flood of people grab a plate and palpitate while more food is being dumped into the pan having their second or third or eighth helping.    Order water, pay tax and leave a tip all for 8 dollars and leave feeling full and regretting eating so much mediocre food while contemplating a possible Montezuma's revenge for dining here.     Maybe takeout is a better option as it keeps you from over-imbibing; or perhaps, it is the thrill of risky dining excursions that keep people coming back . . . will I get sick this time or not?   Will the food be bad enough for me to vow to never come back or will the memory of my excessive consumption be overcome by the lure of cheap all you can eat?       . . . yes it will.

Same great food & service - even after not eating here for 10 years... hot, fresh, great flavor and quality of food.  The Kaum Poong Kee (#12) is prepared fresh to order and is a personal and customer favorite. So are the Katsu & Oyako good choices for authentic, quick service food.  There is a charge for refills on drinks, a charge for Credit Card purchases under $10, and no more Gomashio salt on the tables, but this is my new replacement for the now defunct Tokyo Express of years ago for quick service Japanese food.

Quit calling other places and just rent storage here . . .  you will not find a better price and the facilities are safe and secure.  Access is through keypad and automatic gate.  Gate access hours are reasonable.  The units are the standard roll-up metal doors which take padlocks or disc locks.  They even give you a brand new disc lock when you rent from them.  Plus, there are great deals if you plan on staying for several months, making the monthly net rental price super cheap - even on the big units.  The paved isles are wide enough to get a 26' moving truck in and out fairly easily.  You can pull right up to 90% of the units which are clean and in good repair.  I never once questioned the safety or security of my stuff; even given the neighborhood surrounding, which is predominantly industrial and businesses.   Staff is super nice and helpful.  I really cannot say anything bad about Fiesta Bargain Storage.  It is truly a bargain for what you get and fits the bill to keep your stuff, off-site, accessible and safe.   Rent here and you will be glad you did!

When the Desert Botanical Gardens needs replacement or additional Cacti for their display gardens, these are the people they call.  As a native Arizonan, I have seen cactus all my life and never really given much thought to their unique and splendid appearance.  It wasn't until a visit to The Gardens that I fully realized how many different agave there are and how many varieties of ocotillo are known and how many different colors a cactus can be.  If you enjoy cactus, are looking for a unique gift or just want to add to your garden, this is the place to go!   Arizona Cactus Sales is conveniently located just south of the 202 Santan Freway off ramp on Arizona Avenue, aka State Highway 87.  There is not much visible frontage on Arizona Ave, but the property goes deep to the east and has a large variety of cactus from miniature to huge.  All of the plants are grouped according to genus and sun requirements; Latin names are present for the botanist and common names for the rest of us.  Prices are reasonable, especially considering that some plants take years to get to size.  Further, there are plants here that are simply sold no where else and price can dictate this.  However each time I visit, I have had a pleasant experience and left feeling good about my purchase and supporting a local business.  The staff is knowledgeable, ask them a question and you can get as much information as you desire about every plant they sell.  They will happily give you planting tips, watering advice, troubleshooting for those struggling succulents and gladly help you carry and load all your purchases into your vehicle.  The best part about all the workers is that they are super friendly, they genuinely care about their job and all appear to enjoy what they do.  Given that there are just a few places on earth in which cacti naturally grow and thrive in abundance, and this, the Sonoran Desert being the most diverse among them, it makes sense that there be a cactus nursery to sell to the public.  Given the selection, service and price, Arizona Cactus Sales is perhaps the finest and best place to buy desert cacti and succulents I have ever found.  Therefore, it as good as it gets when looking at, just browsing or wanting to buy cactus.  It is worthy of a stop - it is like a smaller, condensed Botanical Gardens but without the price of admission and parking headaches.  They are open early in the summer, so go before it gets too late and too hot, because they close early too!

Great Fruit and Veggie Market with a local feel that is worth a stop.  Prices are typically much cheaper than your grocer, many times even cheaper than circular ad prices in the chain stores.  This makes coming to Superstition Ranch Market worth the trip even if you are picking up just a few items.    Unlike other "discount" produce stores, I have not noticed any difference in quality or freshness from the items I have purchased here versus "super-premium" grocers.  Also, this is the place for local flavors such as nuts, honey and other tasty items.  Stop in and see how fruits and vegetables were sold half a century ago.

As Chris M. stated, this place overcharges and indeed a $10 charge appeared on the credit card for a six dollar wash. Further, the automatic wash did not even remove the dust spots on the hood.   As a self-serve car wash, there are no employees on premises. Therefore, buyer beware! Anyway, I've already found a much better place, with excellent customer service, and considerably less expensive too!  Otherwise, Blast Off offers nothing more than your standard high pressure wand car wash with a "Touch Less" automatic drive thru that charges your credit card extra $$$.   My suggestion, just keep driving, there are much better options in every cardinal direction not far away.

Tokyo Express defined the Quick Service Rice Bowl take out segment a long time ago.   For over 20 years I have frequented this establishment and been through all of its acquisitions, transitions, growth and downsizing.  One thing remains today: much of what was great is still the same.  The teriyaki sauce is the best (in the early days it was homemade fresh daily), the lemon ginger dressing for the salads should be bottled. Much of the menu has been duplicated by other similar restaurant concepts and in some cases, done better.  I can agree with the quality of the chicken on the regular rice bowls (dark meat) could be better; rather than raising the prices, lesser quality was chosen which was a shame. Two decades have allowed me to try everything on the menu and it is all great.  Standard Japanese fare served up quick and hot. Yum. Maybe its nostalgia but I really love this place and hope it continues to find its niche and endures another 20+ years Final Rating: 4.9 for consistency for many, many years of quick service and tasty meals; Thank you Tokyo Express.

The Defalco name has been a staple in the valley for decades.  And reason so, making no compromises on quality and remembering to treat everyone like a friend of the family is one of the very reasons to frequent this business.  The food is wonderful, tasty and filling, the selection at the deli and small grocery section is ample, the service is with a smile.  Here are a few more reasons you should go here:  ~Large selection of dried pastas, imported food from Europe, and a selection of canned San Marzano tomatoes. ~Make a quick stop on the way home to pick up a tasty bakery treat and a cappuccino. ~Call ahead and order a pizza for takeout or calzone to fill your belly. ~Stop at the deli and pick up some fresh sliced Boar's Head meats & cheeses or some freshly made antipasti, green salad or even ravioli.  You can even take a moment and eat in the restaurant or on the patio. As others have mentioned here, there're many wonderful things on the menu, but I will have to agree that the Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich is absolutely wonderful and perhaps one of the best you will find; as is the Sausage Sandwich and Meatball.  Choose your bread wisely though as some are choices are better than others for the substantial filling within the bread.

Outstanding food, authentic recipes and quality ingredients, freshly prepared and served hot, or cold, and fresh. All set in a quaint and unique setting which is amongst a grocery store.  These are the reasons I have been frequenting Haji-Baba for over 20 years now. It is the go to place for quintessential Middle Eastern food and authentic, tasty, savory, nutritious and delicious offerings for both vegetarians and those who enjoy protein and meat.   I have eaten Greek and Indian foods elsewhere and seem to always judge those meals by this standard, and it is not until I come back, taste the sampler platter, fill my belly, and get some baklava to go, that I realize Haji-Baba is the real deal.  Haji-Baba is Five Stars All The Way! + A Grocery Store Too! Just Go Already!

My Follow-Up Review:  The food at Haji-Baba is still my standard by which I compare other Middle Eastern and Mediterranean food.  Haji is consistently good, filling and flavorful - albeit healthy even.  A true landmark in the valley that must be visited, at least once, by everyone, anyone who desires a taste of the Mediterranean, or is feeling adventurous, without leaving the East Valley.  Although lacking a bit of ambiance, eat here and it may just inspire you to make your own hummus, tabouli or falafel.  This is why Haji-Baba is a one stop affair: after your meal, pop over to the grocery side and grab the needed items (some found nowhere else) to whip up your own creation.    Don't feel like making the food yourself?  Call them, even with short notice, and you can please a hungry crowd and wow them with tasty morsels of delicious homemade food.  Or just get take-out and call it good!  It is worth the drive or a visit.  Light rail stops right out front, bike parking is nearby. Uber your way here and you will be glad you did!

I will echo a former reviewer in saying, frustrated that THEY HAVE MOVED TO TEMPE MARKETPLACE!  They are over by the Men's Warehouse now. That said, as a foodie, it was nice to find a store dedicated to the spice of things.  I was not overly impressed with the individual selection of common A-Z spices.  Most of what is carried will appeal to the masses: Spice blends for certain types of foods, e.g. fish, baking, dips.   I did find and purchase a couple of spices, most are available in 3 or more sizes and even bulk refills in zip top bags.  I believe the spices to be fresh, cannot tell as the dates are in Julian format.  I cannot speak to the quality of the spices yet as I have not tried everything I have purchased yet. I went specifically looking for cumin, oregano and turmeric.  They had no turmeric, I was not impressed with the choice of cumin or oregano; it just seemed, by smell, to lack that "ooh, I love this" mouth watering gotta have.  There were an abundance of staff on hand, not overly pushy though, but ready to answer a question if need be. Final Rating: 4.3 Stars for the difficulty in finding the place, and hoping for a larger selection of single variety spices.  Also disappointment in not finding spices that I can get even in my local Supermarket.

With 500+ Reviews, Most of all it has been said but I will offer this: Fox Concepts Restaurants consistently pulls off a memorable, pleasant experience that is tasty, full of quality and will, occasionally, have a memorable service experience.   All restaurants have their ups & downs, but Olive & Ivy is consistently good, innovative and the atmosphere is quite nice; inside or outside. Drinks are tasty, Scallopini and Cannelloni are both just Yum!  Never had a bad experience here.

Should I look forward to my car needing repair?   . . .  with Hon-Man, Yes!  Should I be so eager to take my car in for routine service?  . . .  with Hon-Man, Yes!  Integrity in business and honesty are cornerstones here and it shows - it also creates a loyal customer base.  I knew what to expect, when to expect it and felt comfortable with the advice offered by Hon-Man.    Worried about that noise from the engine bay or that whine from the transmission?  Pop in and let the Man check it out.  You will leave all fixed up, running smoothly and your pocket book will hardly notice.   If you need a small service like an oil change or a major overhaul come here.  Just check out all the other reviews and you will see why you cannot go wrong by taking your vehicle here - they are all spot on!  As long as there is Hon-Man, you probably will never need to buy a new car again!    Overall Rating: 5 Stars for Service, Price, Mechanical Work, Appointment Times/Availability, Honesty and Integrity.

So, after just two visits, I am mystified as to how and why this Matta's location is still attracting customers.  Granted the original was quite good and worthy of a stop to eat some tasty food; but that location is no more and Matta's has since opened four more locations.  And like anything that has been divided, the parts must become greater than the sum of the original in order to be recognized as at least as good as the original.  Matt's calls this location "Not fast food, but good food fast."    I am ok with the concept of quick serve or no table service, but here, it is an odd mixture of both that just does not work well.  Perhaps it once did, or it makes sense to the owners and management, but I find the entire dine-in experience cold, indifferent and not at all hospitable.  You walk in the door and are immediately in front of a small foyer that adjoins a counter with registers and a menu above and behind.  If you have not been here before, seeing the drive-thru outside and counter placement upon entry, one would assume that this portion of the restaurant is for take away.  It is also easy to think that someone would greet you at the door/counter area and take you to a table - but not so.  You must order and pay at the counter.  Once you do, you are given a number and empty beverage glass and are left to find your own table and fill your own drinks . . . easily done when they are not busy and there is an available clean and empty table.  There is a reason restaurants seat their guests . . . so the restaurant is not over capacity, staff is available to assist and serve guests and there are clean and cleared tables of which to dine.  But here you fend for your self to get a table (I guess this is the difference between dining and eating).  The staff delivering the food bring you chips and salsa, and when your food is delivered, if you're smart, you will ask for an additional bowl of chips and extra salsa because it is nearly impossible to get more once your food is delivered . . . I know, I know, I'm just eating here, if I want to dine I will get takeout and go home (but at these prices? I should at least able to get more salsa or chips or a take-home container on my own without asking staff).  I think because if you pay for your meal first and also self-serve your drinks, it creates an arena for not tipping.  Therefore, you are left with an "I don't really care" attitude by the staff and a bit of guilt that someone else has to buss and clean the tables.  Further, a casual quick serve restaurant mandates concise meal descriptions, an ingredient list and preparation methods on the menu.  And at the very least photographs of the signature dishes, if not all of the dishes.  Just leaving it up to the staff to describe a dish or how it is prepared is just silly.  A positive: the chips and salsa are tasty, the Robert's Taco is an admirable attempt, however, it is a bit greasy and lacking in flavor or quality, especially given the price.  The beans are passable and it is hard to mess up a cheese crisp, but beyond that, No Bueno.  The Guacamole is a very similar to store bought in consistency and taste - if it is homemade, why prepare it in such a way that your customers even ponder the source?  And as much as I have a love for potato tacos, I cannot, in good faith and conscience, return to try them.  The final straw was a recommendation by the staff: the chilie relleno.  The relleno was filled with ground beef that was severely lacking in flavor and an overall consistency that was off putting.  Sadly, it was left uneaten, which is very unusual that I ever leave food on a plate, let it go to waste or not take it home for later.  The biggest disappointment came from the $42 spent for two combo plates and a sampler platter - and only having water to drink.  $42 is sit-down, full table-service, ingredients oozing with quality, flavorfully spiced and seasoned food, prepared, presented and plated with care price territory . . . but with the number of customers that frequent here I cannot see anything changing for the better.  Spending money on food without pleasure is, well, like flushing money down the toilet; but I digress.  For me, I am just not going to do it again, there are so many other Mexican food places to eat, even ones with a drive-thru, that are better quality, better service, better layout, even better ambiance and certainly a lot less expensive.  Yes, as I have said before, Mexican cuisine is so very subjective and that is precisely why on the same occasion that I had the dismal chilie relleno, a neighboring table was raving at how good it was.    All of this has left me with no reason to stop the car here . . . I will just keep going . . . and unless you have eaten here, and like the food, the service and the prices, I suggest you go elsewhere too.

A fun place to stop and sample all the varieties of Olive Oil.  Good selection of tasty vinegars too.   I would like to have known more of the origins and methods of where the olive stock comes from, how it is harvested and what fair trade practices, if any, this company supports.   After talking with the staff, there is apparently another location in addition to this one in Old Town Scottsdale.   On my way out I was a little disappointed to find out they offer additional varieties that are not on display or for sample; a "menu" would be good for this reason alone.   I do like the single price point pricing for most all of their products though. Staff was helpful, not overbearing, and friendly.  I will probably return if I am in the area. Final Rating: 4.2

Yes, 4 stars for the reason you go to a restaurant: Food! Quality was good.  Atmosphere was Trendy Scottsdale.  Love the name and well executed theme of the name throughout - menu, tables, decor, employee uniform etc. Food was really tasty, Pretzel fondue hit the spot.  Monkey Bread was great, seasonings on the entrees were done with tasteful restraint. Waitress was cute as a bug's ear, although she did forget part of our order; to her partial defense, the place was packed but I would have liked to try the forgotten appetizer. The Death's Door adult beverage was a perfect concoction: I want a large pitcher with a long flexible straw . . . floor here I come!  But for $10 bucks it better be darn good. I was not surprised to learn that this restaurant was part of the Fox Family of restaurants as my other experiences with them have all been top notch (Olive & Ivy, Bloom, Sauce). Fun place, I will go back if nothing else to try more tasty food. Final Rating: 4.3

Great Authentic Chicago Eatery in NE Mesa.  This place is certainly busy at lunch and understandably so.  The service is friendly and prompt, even at peak times when the staff is running full tilt, they will still take the time to explain the menu or take a special request . . . and usually with a smile.    The layout of the place is not large and is long and narrow so you have to be a bit patient when it is busy with a line at the register and orders being picked up at the counter, but the tables usually empty fairly quickly.  There is a self serve drink fountain with refillable Pepsi products but it is placed on the counter right next to the register so it is a get in and get out affair.  The walls are filled with 80s & 90s memorabilia from the Greater Chicagoland Area and it is fun to take a step back in time to reminisce about some of the great talent that came from the heart of the midwest.  The prices are reasonable and the quality is on the better side of above average.  However on some of the menu items, such as the Italian Beef and Italian Sausage, the meat does not completely fill the bun and the bun can be a bit soggy (even when ordered "dry" with jus on the side).  Also, the sweet and hot peppers, although tasty, do not add much to help fill the substantially sized bread . . . we need a larger sausage or smaller bun here. But the fries are crisp and fresh, the Chili & Cheese Fries are nice and cheesy as well as tasty and the small size is a reasonable portion.  The sliders are certainly tasty and the ratio of meat, cheese and bun are spot on, but you will want to have more than one; lucky they offer a 3, 4 or 6 pack to feed your appetite. The Chicago dog has all the necessary ingredients and is a good rendition of a hot dog that can be found on the corner of Michigan Ave and Randolph Street.  But, you would be better off customizing you dog just as you like it as there are better menu choices offered such as the Chili Cheese dog, Hamburgers or Sliders - unless you just need that poppy seeded, celery salted, sport peppered, tomato and onion topped Vienna Beef frank to quell that craving of a Chicago street corner meal on the go.  All in all, Chicagoland Hotdogs & More does a good job, especially on the "More" part.  It is worth a stop if you are in the area and will surely please most any American palate.

With unlimited washes for $16.95 a month, I am finding myself heading to Quick N Clean every time my vehicle gets a tiny bit dusty or has a watermark from a raindrop.  You just drive up, pay (or use your fast-pass which opens the gate when you grab your receipt from the machine) line up your tires in the track with the guidance of a worker, and sit in your car as all of the non-abrasive scrubbies whirl around, soap and wax are sprayed about and clean your car.  If you have an especially bug-infested bumper, the attendant will high-pressure spray your front-end before the machine takes over.  My car has never been so sparkly, spot-free, had a clean interior or smelled so good since I got a Quick Pass.  There are three levels of washes that are offered for a monthly fee (this location, which is independent from the others, only offers a Quick Pass valid at a couple of other locations; ask before you buy a pass if you travel around the valley) which range from $12-$25 a month.   I chose the Deluxe Wash which gets you a wash, tire scrub, undercarriage cleaning, wax spray and even shine on the tires, included are a interior freshener and disposable chamois to dry your vehicle.  Vacuums are free with all car washes.  If the machine does not get all of the dirt, you can ask to go through again - I have never had this happen with a mid or higher level wash, but I can see how the basic wash can do a minimal job.  Whether you get a quick $3.00 wash or the Deluxe $15.00 top-to-bottom wash, your vehicle will get a high-speed air dry and you have the option to wipe it dry under the shaded canopies or use the 60-mile an hour dry method.  There are vending machines if you require additional car-care products.  If you do get just the basic car wash, you do not get a spot-free rinse or a free chamois to dry the car.  Contrary to what others have said, there is a difference in which mechanisms activate within the car wash based on which level of wash you paid for.  Therefore, it behooves you to get at least one of the mid level washes; doing so ensures you get a complete spotless dry and shiny tires at the least.  Whichever option you choose, having a Quick Pass allows the option to get in and out quickly if you only have five minutes.  Then, on other days when you have more time, you can vacuum the interior, clean the windows inside and out and wipe dry your vehicle top-to bottom.  The good thing about those days when you are not in a hurry is that it allows you to take the time to inspect all nooks and crannies of your car - last time I was there, I took the time to wipe all of the rubber parts on the doors and trunk and discovered that a loose gasket was the culprit of my incessant leaky trunk - who knew a car wash would fix a years-old drip?  For that reason, I now see a car wash as an essential part of preventative maintenance on a vehicle and knowing that I can go as often as I would like is well worth the money I have spent.   Overall Rating: 4 Stars Service: 3.8 Stars Price-Value: 3.8 Connivence: 4.2 Stars  (p.s., yes, I was trying to set a record for most-hypendated words in a review for a car wash)

It's Good, It's Busy, It's worth the trip and wait in line.    Tasty Tacos, Crispy Chewy Gorditas, Flavorful Beans and Tasty Tortillas - Plus the Tortilla Chips are Hot, Thin, Properly Salted and Come With A Salsa that is Exclusive to the Chips.  Here you will find reasonably priced freshly made food, that is constantly being cooked and prepared.  There is a swarm of people coming, going and socializing and eating.  There is a salsa bar that will please most any pallet, although I would like to see a slight pickle to the carrots and onions, however, the cucumbers and radish have a nice crisp crunch.  The tacos are of the 6" corn or flour tortilla variety as are the gorditas.  The burritos are ample in size and satisfying, the quesadillas are nicely sized and cheesy.  The Papa Loca (a baked potato, mashed, mixed with cheese and choice of meat) is filling and yummy.  The beans are good all by themselves or in a burrito sprinkled with cheese; also flavorful is the chicken and birra meats as fillings.  All in all, Backyard Taco pleases the need for a street style taco or burrito or Mexican fix that is big on flavor and easy on the wallet.

Yes, Tasty, Filling and just a little bit different for BBQ - Ryno's fit the bill for a savory and satisfying meal.   Green Chili cream corn is a little sweet, a little spicy; but just right.  Brisket was quite good too, two BBQ sauces: spicy and regular are there if you need them.  Try it, I think you'll agree, it is yummy! A Solid 4 stars for service, cleanliness, taste, and value.

What a fun place . . . and one of only four stores like it in the U.S!  Think Restaurant Supply meets Smart & Final meets Costco meets Sam's Club and you have US Foods Chef'Store.  Owned by US Foods, which supplies many of the restaurants reviewed here on Yelp with food and restaurant supplies, Chef'Store is a way to bring much of what is offered by catalog or delivery truck to a store-front which is accessible by everyone.  Own a food truck or a special events food vendor? Shop here.  Out of something in the kitchen and can't wait until next delivery?  Shop here.  Have a catering gig or fundraising event and need to make 100# of potato salad?  Shop here.  Love Cholula Hot Sauce and want to float your eggs in it?  Shop here - you can buy it by the half-gallon!    Is it a bit warm outside and do you need of a whole beef brisket?  Walk through the massive walk-in cooler and grab a nice brisket along with some butter, cheese or even cold Mexi-Coca by the case all offered at 34° - they even have 3M Hi-Vis Safety Jackets to keep you warm in the cooler if you desire; I assume they are day-glow yellow so you can be found should you get lost wandering about the cooler.  If you need a 4 gallon iced tea dispenser, stacking chairs, cleaning supplies or condiments and spices in bulk, this is your place.  It is just fun to come in and look around or grab a cart and load it up with frozen meatballs, gallon jugs of BBQ sauce, add a case of foam plates, toothpicks and grab a full size Vollrath buffet warmer to cook it all up and you have an instant party.  Restauranteurs, Food Service Owners, even Foodies and Bulk Buyers will enjoy what is offered at Chef'Store. Grab a flat pallet cart and load it up . . . it's party time!

EVIT Bistro 13 sits on the south side of Main Street in west Mesa and is easily passed by; but you should look for it and stop in for a bite to eat.  Situated in front of a Standard Restaurant Supply store and, appropriately, next to the East Valley Institute of Technology, is a great breakfast and lunch eatery run by culinary students under the tutelage of a chef/instructor.  Like most other "school/retail" establishments such as massage schools, beauty schools, hair institutes and the like, two things are prominent here: a great price and value for a product, and a high likelihood of receiving a quality product and service.  However, because this is a school run by learning students, there is the chance that one or both of these things will be amiss; but that tends to not be the norm here.  Inside there is a travel theme clearly conceived and decorated by students.  There are mosaics, paintings and even metal wall art that no doubt has been crafted by EVIT students that fit nicely into a student run/themed restaurant.  The colors inside are appealing and attractive, refreshing even.  There is also a nice outdoor seating area to enjoy your meal al fresco.    From the outside, it is obvious that Bistro 13 is a former fast food building.  This allows for ample parking and the presence of a drive-thru.  If you are in a hurry or want an order to go, just call ahead and pick up your meal from the drive-thru.    Because each order is cooked fresh, service can be a bit slow, but you are rewarded with a hot, fresh and tasty meal.  I was told that everything is made fresh, on premises, including such things as dressings, sauces and dips, waffle cut fries and even desserts.  In addition, there are daily specials that seem to fit the overall theme of "Global Cuisine," so look forward to additional surprises not seen on the regular menu.    One drawback of freshly prepared food cooked to order is that wait times for your meal can go into the 10+ minute range for something like the tasty Panko Chicken Fingers or a Sonoran Chicken Sandwich even when moderately busy.  However, the food is generally worth the wait.  This is also why you will want to call ahead before using the drive-thru.  When dining inside, you order and pay at the counter, then the food is delivered to you by one of the students or instructors.  There is real flatware wrapped in napkins and real glassware used for the beverages - so kudos to EVIT for not going the "disposable" route.    So what about the food?  Besides being hot and fresh, the flavors are distinct, not over the top, and proportionally thought through.  There is a nice level of spice, when appropriate, and seasoning is consistently spot-on.  The sauces and dressings are tasty and distinct enough from each other to please almost any palette.  The fries are seasoned nicely, and are only enhanced by NOT HEINZ ketchup - but a proper International Red Sauce that usually is called catsup.  (Read my other reviews and you will know my affinity for catsup that is not the rotten tasting, overly-sweet, lacking real tomato flavor, Heinz variety that is way too prevalent in restaurants today - please, more places offer any other brand besides Heinz, you are doing your food a dis-service by using Heinz).  But, I digress.   Other notable touches are homemade pickle spears that are crispy crunchy and distinctly seasoned and the ability to substitute bread on a sandwich with two grilled Portobello mushrooms for a low-carb option.  Overall, I am impressed with the food choices offered at Bistro 13.  Given the reasonably priced menu items, I know most diners will be happy they stopped here.  Just know that the hours are limited to two and a half hours for breakfast and three hours for lunch after being closed for an hour in between, so get to breakfast by 9:30am or lunch by 1:30pm and if you go at 10:00am or 2:00pm, you are out of luck; so plan ahead.  And yes, they take credit cards.   Overall Rating: 4 Stars Food: 4.3 stars Service: 3.8 Stars Cleanliness: 3.6 Stars Atmosphere: 4 Price/Value: 4.5 Stars

Twisted Pies Pizzeria is a local family-owned business that distinguishes itself as a pizzeria -  which is to say that they are serious about their craft.   Offered is freshly made to order New York Italian style pizza and twice cooked wings for dine in, pickup or delivery.  I chose to order online via Yelp and was treated to a minute by minute update as to the progress of my order from placing the order to the restaurant receiving the order to a knock at my door . . . nice touch.   The pizza has a nice ratio of topping to sauce to crust thickness.  The crust is both crispy and has a bit of a chew to it - kudos to the mastery of such a recipe and a proper bake in the oven; perhaps it is the special Italian flour used in the dough or just knowing the precise daily humidity and barometric pressure and then knowing how many times to knead the dough accordingly.  The sauce is certainly fresh tasting and has a great balance of sweet to acid to spice to viscosity; again, using San Marzano tomatoes and fresh garlic makes this difference. The quality of the cheese and toppings is apparent in taste and texture ensuring a consistent bite each time without the cheese sliding off the saucy crust or the toppings falling off between bites; both are also freshly sliced and grated - apparent by taste and appearance.    Care and love exist at this pizzeria and are put into each pie made and it reflects in taste.  The wings are done well, which is to say that they are twice cooked: first fried then baked.  This gives both a proper texture to the skin and allows the sauce to coat the wing evenly yet still have hints of char on them fulfilling the primal taste buds of grilled meat.  Offered are four kinds of sauce: Mild, Hot, BBQ and Spicy BBQ.  The BBQ sauce complements the cook of the wings as being not too sweet or smokey or spicy.  The mild wings are not greasy nor are they overly spiced or sauced.  I found the flavors to be on par with the better pizza and wings I have had, however, I thought both the pizza and two flavors of wings were on the salty side; being as I tolerate salt fairly well, I am guessing that most will find the saltiness a bit much, perhaps the chef was a bit heavy handed on this day.  Overall, Twisted Pies Pizzeria is a good choice for pizza and wings . . . especially if you live in their delivery area and want to order in.

Great weather, good location and good time of year to have a festival.   It was a bit unorganized at first, not enough communication with ticket sellers and some inconsistencies among prices and offerings by vendors causing a perceived quality and value disparity with the pizza samples, slices and whole pies. The lines were long shortly after opening at this sold out event, but that was to be expected with a popular food such as pizza.   There was some great pizza, some not so great, so some was fresh and tasty, some was piping hot, some was cold and old. It would be nice to have more places to sit and enjoy the band or the company of friends and libations while eating pizza, sipping beer and wine and having ice cream or shaved ice. However, there were many happy faces, and the outdoor games were a nice touch.   The festival had a good mix of vendors and it was not too bad for an inaugural event. Next year the kinks should be worked out and vendors will be better prepared. Overall a job well done, looking forward to next year.

Rocco's has returned to its original owners.  After a foray into "beta" franchising, Rocco and his wife are back at the helm running things.  It is easy to drive right past Rocco's, partly because of the smallish logo on the smallish sign and unless you knew to look at the Chevron gas station convenience store on the corner, you could easily miss Rocco's because it shares walls with the C-Store.  Here are some things that are good about Rocco's: online ordering through Grub Hub or right here on Yelp, a menu choice of pizza, subs, wings, Philly Cheese Steaks, Gyros, salads & burgers.  They have reasonable prices for size and quantity you receive.  In addition, there is a fairly extensive catering menu for those gatherings when you don't want to cook but entertain with tasty food.  Some things that need tweaking and a bit of finesse: the long wait times for food, especially when ordering online (up to two hours in the middle of the afternoon?).  The inconsistent taste and preparation of the food; sometimes the onions on the Philly and Subs are slivered, sometimes they are chopped, sometimes the food is salty, sometimes it is bland (salt the meat!), sometimes the mayo, mustard and ketchup are a bit heavy, other times they are lacking - same with lettuce and tomato.  The Sub/Philly rolls have a bit of a crunchy/flaky exterior, which is nice, but the bread can sometimes be a bit tough and chewy.    The pizza is a tasty New York style pie with a nice ratio of cheese-to-topping-to-sauce-to-crust.  And given the price of $5.99 for a 16 inch, toppings are $1.00 each, the pizza becomes a good value; even compared to other offerings by the national chains - no coupons needed.  Given the option of getting a carryout pizza, for just seven bucks for a single topping pizza, I don't think you will find a better value for a pizza where you can actually enjoy the flavor.  Overall, Rocco's is a solid choice for pizza, wings, salads and sandwiches.  If you are in the area, it is worth a stop to try a cheese steak, pizza or just visit with Rocco himself.
