The food tasted OK but you really could not enjoy it. The seats were not adjustable and you were practically eating and lying down. Very uncomfortable! Food was over priced for its quality and the servers kept walking in front of my view.  Very distracting! Bar tenders in the lobby were all kinds of rude and the alcohol was way overpriced. I would recommended IPics!

Not really that good!! Biscuits were horrible and the food took a while and came out dried out!  Got the Burtend Salad and I got six cubes of meat...paid $14 for a bowl of ok lettuce.....not good. Food is blah and way over priced!!

Fantastic!! I have been longing for a casual place to get seafood and I have found it. Great food and completely worth the prices. I can't wait to try everything. If you are not sure get Oscar's Ultimate, it has a little bit of everything. All you can eat fish & chips for $10......Nice and welcoming staff and fast service.

The new location is nice but it is no longer convenient! You now have to drive to the location instead of walking there from the other shops. Seems like a all new staff missing that extra customer service the other location had. All business no personality! Outdoor patio is very large but very uncomfortable with the ridiculous loud drive-thru speaker that completely ruins any relaxation or concentration. Very disappointing!

The place was clean and well decorated. The food came out fast, which means it was prepared in advance and it kinda tasted like it. The menu is crazy over priced for the food you get. I do not mind paying money for good food but this was bland and did not taste authentic. The fry bread was greasy and tasteless! The tables are too close together and we kept running into other customers and chairs. I bought a taco, tamale, tostada, rice and beans and one fry bread taco, add two medium drinks and we spent $28. Tasted like a $4 meal! You are better off at one of the "bertos"!!

Customer service was less to be desired! Staff was filled with rude and impatient teenagers. Food is overpriced and the descriptions are somewhat off. Ordered a sub and recieved a flatbread sandwich. Better off at Subway, a lot more food for the same price.

Small and quaint with excellent decor! I can not remember the last time I had a meal with every bite tasting so flavorful and fresh. Great place to eat!

When you walk in the place is amazing! Handpainted furniture and very authentic looking. Your eyes can wonder for hours. That is where the magic ends! Our food came out burnt and over cooked. The staff was arguing it was not but when it was re-cooked it was much better. All the plates are really big to hide the fact you are barely getting any food. I guess they think if you spread it around it looks like more. They must have been running out of the proteins because it was used sparingly. My taco maybe had a spoonful of meat. I will say most of the "bertos" taco stands are a lot better. We thought if the prices dropped it could be a cute lunch stop but definitely not a place you want to drop cash for dinner. This place is too over priced and the food was no were near authentic!

The food was great, as was the service. I Wanted to try it after passing by ,it for a while now. Great taste. Their "Bigs" sandwich is really not all that big but very good. Great outdoor sitting area and perfect location. The prices are crazy high for the amount of food you get but the taste is right!

Prices higher than Red Lobster and quality of food one step above Long John Silvers. It was a huge disappointment! You walk in and it has a authentic west coast feel but, the quality of food was very poor. Ordered the gumbo and I believe it was canned and if it wasn't then I have had better canned gumbo. It was very slimy and just resembled brown muck. Not appealing! Fried oysters tasted canned with a metallic aftertaste. The shrimp PO'Boy had 4 popcorn shrimp with blankets of breading on a large roll. The coleslaw was average nothing special. The brisket sandwich was dry and over done and the bread fell apart before we could even pick it up.  I am afraid to order Lobster or crab as it would be a big waste of money. Sorry but not worth the money!

I hate to say it but it is one of the worst places I have been in a long time. It started by having to park in the Mud and then walk around the building to the entrance. The only reason we decided to go there is the false advertising for Sushi Bar. They claimed they just never changed the sign. Will all the business one would have to think they left there on purpose to trick people. We would have left had we not been going to the Opera and didnt have time to select another location. Poor service and small overpriced food. I have tasted better at a back yard get together. I do not recommend!!! People started walkingbout as they were not getting service. Bad start to our night!

As you walk in the order Kiosks are too close to the door and you walk right into people trying to order or people are walking into you as you order, bit akward, I don't suggest using them. The food was somewhat bland and a little overpriced for the quantity you get. There was fast and friendly service and the place was very clean. If you are hungry and you love to eat be prepared to drop a lot of cash!
