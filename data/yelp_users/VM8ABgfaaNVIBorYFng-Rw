LOTS of cock sucking, ass eating and cum swapping--in PUBLIC, on the patio during the Sunday Beer Bust. They are extremely lucky they haven't been shut down by the Phoenix/Tempe Police. No wonder everyone absolutely LOVES this place. I didn't. Tacky, distasteful and disgusting. I left shortly after arriving, after witnessing this spectacle. The owners should be ashamed of themselves. I think I have a call to make...

Can be a bit of a frenzy with everyone in there after their bargains! I have been VERY satisfied with everything I bought from Last Chance, but you DO have to look. Be prepared to spend some time looking for things that fit you and your needs. Store is messy, with clothing on the floor and on the racks, but I cannot blame the sales associates, the customers are in those areas so much it's nearly impossible to gather them and hang them up.   Be careful with shoes. Apparently Nordstrom's policy allows you to take worn shoes back at any time. I have a thing about wearing previously worn shoes, so be sure to inspect them thoroughly before buying. Clothing you almost have to try on. With cuts and style varying so much, it is essential to get a good and proper fit.   If you love scouting for a bargain in a jam-packed store, then this is for you! I go occasionally, after taking a sedative and having a few drinks to keep my nerves calm.

ABSOLUTELY LOUSY!! When I was there the owner was fiddling with his tablet and came off as rude. All I wanted was a slice of pizza and a drink. He rudely told me, "we don't serve pizza by the slice." You are a pizza shop. What pizza shop does don't sell pizza by the slice? Not seeing anything else I was dying to have (and they were expensive, and did not have drink prices listed), I ordered a side salad and an Extra Large Diet Coke. The cup he gave me was a 20 oz cup. I would hate to see what a small is. My total was under $5, and they could not accept my debit card for payment. Once again, there wasn't even a sign telling customers that. I told this foreign man who was obviously inconvenienced by someone coming into the place, to take his food and his lousy service and shove it up his ass. I left and will NEVER return. I suggest you don't, either.

I got two tickets to see Rocky Horror Picture show with a shadow cast free from FillASeat (a joke in itself), and took my boyfriend to see this. In the email, it clearly states to pick tickets up at the box office between 8-8:30 pm the evening of the event, so we arrive at 8:10, ready to pick up our tickets. We were informed by security that we could not pick up tickets until 9 pm. So, we waste time for 50 minutes.  While in line some lady tells all the women to have their purses ready for inspection. They acted like TSA agents, ready to expel anyone who was carrying anything illegal. We finally reach the "box office" to pick up the FREE tickets are informed there is a mandatory $24 fee for drinks. The email from Fill A Seat CLEARLY states that buying drinks is OPTIONAL but recommended, not MANDATORY. So, instead of fighting with this shady man, I bought the required 4 drink tickets.  We make our way back to the room where this event is taking place. While we are walking, we are talking to each other, remarking about what joke this place seems to be. And boy were we right! WE were stopped by some annoying man trying to force us to buy party favor bags, needed to "capture the full ambiance" of the show. Bitch, please! I have seen this movie many times, and you don't need these "enhancements" to have a good time.  We decided to not buy anything more.   We were APPALLED by what we saw when we walked in. Tattered, stained and dirty folding chairs that were lined so close to the row in front of you, you practically had your knees in the ribs of the person seated in front of you. And the stench from the trash that attended this event! The woman in front of me smelled like a musty basement, and the extreme heat in this room (I swear it was over 100 degrees and NO AC), only heightened the aromas. Most of the people who attended this event were obviously Mesa, Tempe, and Phoenix trash. Very few people had class. Even the supposed VIP's were some of the city's wasteland of people. The screens were too small to be showing a movie on, and the sound was awful.   TRYING to put my drink tickets to good use, I went to the "bar," which was basically a window in a wall, and tried to order a White Russian. I was told, "we can't make that. We don't have cream or milk for it." So I asked if they could make a Blue Hawaiian. Watching the bartender make it in a clear Solo cup was a joke, and he didn't even make it correctly. All he put in the cup was pineapple juice and blue curaco. No rum. No cherry. No cream of coconut. My "Blue" Hawaiian was a Green Hawaiian, because, let me give a basic kindergarten lesson to this "bartender." Yellow + Blue = Green. My boyfriend had a Diet Coke, and I should have stuck with that.   Finally, about 11:10 pm, after they did some ridiculous thing with "Virgins" and had a raffle that was stupid and sung Happy Birthday to some trashy, drunk VIP, the movie started. It was still HOT in this room and the stench from the non-showered bodies permeated the air even more so now.  People were yelling the dumbest shit at the wrong time during the movie, and it became annoying. The shadow actors appear to be community theater rejects and couldn't act or in this case, improvise their way out of a paper bag, let alone be remotely entertaining.  By  intermission, he and I were fed up and left, bitching and complaining about the whole experience.   Needless to say, we will never be back, and I will NEVER again get free tickets from the farce of a site called FillASeat. What a waste of a night and of $24.

I went on opening day, at the new Camelback location. Everyone was upbeat and excited. I had never visited Hopdoddy before, so the ordering concept for me and the other person I was with was a bit overwhelming. But our cashier was right there and was very patient with all our questions!   I loved the options in the soda machine. They use the healthier option of pure cane sugar over the sweeteners and actual sugar in their drink options. Cream Sods is awesome! I hadn't had it ages and I have always loved it. A delicious healthier option.    Our fries were hot and delicious. Our burgers were tender and juicy and delicious.   Servers were attentive and even offered to fill drinks for us, although it is self-serve. Decor and mood was upbeat and urban hipster. I loved it and will go back soon!
