My favorite sandwich in the world. Been eating here since I was 2 and I will never get tired or sick of it. Duck and decanter holds a special place in my heart. There is nothing bad about this place :).

Beautiful course that when in good condition is one of the most fun courses you can play in az. I hope that they continue to improve and draw more golfers year after year.

If you were to build a perfect dive bar/ historic az bar this would be your place.  It has become a favorite of mine, filled with fun people and a friendly and kind staff.  Great place to bring out of towners for a taste of the old west and a $9 pitcher of Kiltlfter.

Good happy hour and attentive bar staff. The decor is very dated and the old cigarette smell sticks after you leave but it has a certain old school vibe about it that makes it unique. I enjoy their mussels and crab cakes.

I made a reservation for weds the 29th at 8pm for my girlfriends birthday, we were early and checked in and we had to wait till 8:30 to be sat. It took us going to the host stand 4 times before they sat us, the service was horrible. After complaining enough a manager came and sat us, he said nothing about the wait or even apologized. The service was bad, I've been here before and the service was perfect. This time it took 20 minutes just to get our drinks and 45 minutes for our entrees to arrive.  I told them it was a birthday and the server had no clue. It wasn't until we told the server that we had a bday that he acknowledged it. Very disappointing for $300 meal for 4 people, I will be taking my money elsewhere next time, food was up to par but they just set the sides down and walked away, no pre bussing was done until we put our napkins on our plates and stacked them up. This was a bad experience for such a high quality restaurant, I won't return sadly. I suggest orange sky or another spot for special occasions. The manager still never revisited the table to see how things were and the server never asked if we wanted anything else to drink. Sad experience for a birthday that was supposed to be special.

My favorite Starbucks in the valley, always a warm and friendly staff and the only store that remembers me even tho I only go through the drive thru. This is the only store that I go to when I want my favorite drink (5 shot Americano in a trente cup), no other store will make this for me. I love this store, thank you to that crew! You guys are awesome!

A horrible representation of the native New Yorker franchise, this location is filthy dirty. We sat in the lounge for a beer and some wings and I immediately noticed the sticky/dirty table, I then noticed the shades were covered with sauce and slime of every type, the staff was engaged with conversations with "regulars" and failed to pay any type of decent attention to other guests. My cousin ordered wings which were ok but the service was impersonal and un attentive, this is the worst looking and ran native New Yorker I have been to. The decor is horrible and rivals places on reality tv that need a major makeover, I would guess if corporate came here they would shut it down. This is a sad snap shot of a good company.

Beautiful restaurant with beautiful food and views. I had an unforgettable birthday here in a private booth.  I had lobster while my gf had crab legs and they were both perfect. This rivals any other high end spot in az.

Went here to show them off to family and I was embarrassed at what kind of service they provide. I know that they are a family ran restaurant but they need to seriously rethink how the train their staff. They have the tools (iPad pos systems for the severs) yet they lack the simple service standards that anyone would expect from a restaurant with standards set in place. The server was flustered with 3 tables and forgot that we hadn't ordered yet even though our menus were closed and on the side of the table, this place needs someone who can implement rules and standards that will show their food justice. BOH...keep up the good work, FOH crew please get some more training on how to properly run a floor and serve tables.

Went in yesterday for a quick bite to eat and left happy. Their Caesar salad and butternut squash soup are both quite tasty, we also ordered the French fries and a margherita pizza. The French fries were massive and tasty, the pizza was perfectly cooked and very clean tasting. I look forward to returning soon.

Caballero offers a great mix of new modern cuisine and probably the best draft beer selection I have come across in the west valley. The ceviche bar is worth stopping in for alone. I normally get the chicken Phoenix or the crusted fish selection, if you go you must try their cupcakes as well!!! Friendly service, good food, great beer...good spot, hope they're here for a while.

Beautiful place with great food, the chips and salsa are to die for. They have a wide variety of margaritas that are all worth trying. I have been there twice this past week and loved it all, the tacos are amazing and the sweet potato chicken tortilla soup is outstanding. Fun spot and I'm glad Z'Tejas built this is in phx.

Went to just check out the new store and fell in love. Their simple menu and extensive draft selection make this my new favorite pit stop. Their bartenders are friendly and engaging, they are knowledge and never hesitant on offering a beer sample. They have a great local beer menu and great local vibe.
