Our daughter Heather, was born with a congenital heart defect. She has been under the care of a Pediatric Cardiologist since the night she was born.   We (with the Lords help) believe that she has surpassed most Doctors and has even been told "I would bet my paycheck (DOCTORS) that you would have had open heart by now!"   When we moved here to Arizona 3 years ago, we were more concerned about getting a new Pediatric Cardiologist than anything else! We started off at the Cambridge location and did not like the cardiologist we were seeing.  After some research we found Dr. Garn at the Dobson Location! All I can say is that we love him and we actually look forward to seeing him for our 6 month check ups. He spends a lot of quality time with us making sure we know exactly what the latest update is on Heather. He seems very thourough and doesn't want to just go in and do a "heart cath" which we are grateful for! Staff is great and wait times are minimal compared to otehr places.

This particular Petsmart is for the birds! It's not very clean or organized. The aisles are very narrow. They do have a lot of aquarium items, including fresh water fish. Would like to see them make it a little more user friendly.  Most Petsmart's are the same unfortunately.

Normally I wouldn't give a Vet 5 stars, however this time, I believe they deserve it!  The staff is so friendly, from the vet tech to the vet, to the office manager. They are helpful and really seem to care not only about your pet but you to.   We have brought 2 out of 3 dogs here, Gizmo and Gadget. Both dogs have been treated like royalty and it shows in all aspects.  Gizmo had 7 EXTRA teeth removed by Dr. Wodiske a week ago. The staff was friendly and they were even able to get them in the day after he was examined to have his "SHARK" teeth removed. From the beginning to the end it went very well. There were no surprises in the cost, they went over that prior to surgery. Everything went smooth and Gizmo was a happy camper the following day :)  Gadget is our newest puppy, she has Giardia and has had some difficulty with gaining weight because of the parasite. We have her on special food, medicine, and lots of love. Dr. Wodiske has been AWESOME with her and has truly shown a deep concern and love for her well being.  I will continue to update with progress.I highly recommend this office and especially Dr. Wodiske!!

We enjoy bowling, and with the Summer pass and Kids bowl free, we thought we would give these lanes a chance.  The lanes are old and run down - but they do bowl well. We had a lot of problems with re-sets and we did have to get management to come more then 3 times to give us a hand. That was a bummer :(  Food was good. Chicken was tasty. My daughter loved the chicken wrap. Fries were good. Pretzels were HORRIBLE! I had the Cinnamon and my son had the salted pretzels, both of didn't enjoy them.  Bathroom was very clean but there seemed to be a lingering odor, so I would suggest that get looked at.  We will be back because they are the closest to us, but for no other reason than that.

Impressed with the price of items, sale items, and staff, but the store itself leaves a lot to be desired.  Second trip here in 2 days. Sale items are good value, just be careful not to pay full price for anything here.   Staff is friendly - but not helpful when you are looking for something and can't find it.   The store needs a cleaning to say the least. There was a cup of coffee on a shelf near the scrap-booking area on Wednesday night. The same cup of coffee was still sitting in the same spot on Thursday afternoon when they opened the doors at 4:00PM. REALLY? No one cleans the store??? I find this to be terrible customer service on cleanliness!

I prefer this Fry's over the one at Ellsworth and Broadway.  This one has a nice Deli, Bakery, and the produce is awesome!  I am not happy with the butcher since they told me no point in getting the fresh sausage, just get the packaged since it was on sale. Why would I ask for fresh than?   The store is clean, but I don't like the fact that the people who sweep always seems to make you fee like YOU are in their way?! I think they need to sweep around us not the opposite.   Love DOUBLE COUPONS up to $1.00. LOVE the idea that prices are lower than most local stores on a lot of items.

For a buffet restaurant this is one of the better ones!  Almost all the food on the buffet is hot. I have a hard time with the taco area, it never seems as fresh as the major food lines.   I love the crab salad and hope they never get rid of it! It's always cold and tasty.  I did not like the Pasta bar and I am really glad they got rid of it.  Now they have the Mongolian grill which is very good. You choose your meat, veggies, and sauce and it's cooked for you. I really love that part!  Only thing that bothers me is I see the manager spend a lot of time sitting with some of the customers, chatting, rather then working. Maybe she should manage a little more rather just talk to her regular customers.  We continue to come back time and time again because the quality of food really is good compared.

Came here for Breakfast this morning, not so bad!  First I would like to say that I think they need to add Apple Juice and Grape Juice to the Breakfast bar.   They offered a good selection, scrambled eggs, toast, pancakes, waffles, GRITS, bacon, sausage, and a lot more.   I really enjoyed the grill area where you can get an egg up or an omelet, fresh off the grill :)  We will come back another weekend to see if they make any updates :)

I try over and over to like Kmart, but it's just not there :(  I do like the sales and the merchandise that is headed out and reduced a lot! When I do go to Kmart I always walk out with something, but I don't go there for the purpose of buying anything.  Today we went looking at Back Packs, found one and waited 15 minutes in line to check out. I stood there thinking is this really worth me saving $6.00? Since my daughter loved the back pack we stayed in line, but really? They had 2 registers open, the one I wasn't in had an individual on a shopping spree, so that lane was definitely out! My lane was just dog slow! I was the 3rd person in line, but each item seemed to take forever to go through. I stood there staring at the customer service area where a cashier stood just looking around bored to death!  I don't think they do a good job of customer service and getting you in and out effectively.   The store needs a complete over haul and clean up. The parking lot is easy to get in and out of though.

Awesome - I have been going here for about 3 months now. Rose does my nails and I absolutely think she takes the time to do it right. It's nice to know someone takes their time and doesn't rush.  A little on the high end - but worth it!

I like the idea of having the same hairstylist each and every time. Unfortunately with some places, the stylist come and go so quickly they don't get to learn what you like and all.  The Augusta Ranch Hair Studio is different, they cater to people and the staff has been then for a long time.   Angie does my color and cuts! Which I love! She is friendly and very knowledgeable about products. Isn't pushy on selling you items you don't need either.  Pam (owner) has done a straightening technique on my hair and also my daughters. She does a great job and it is SO much cheaper than a Brazilian.   I do wish the prices were lower. I think a hair cut alone is $23.00 but knowing that you have the same stylist each visit does out weight the price.

The kids and I LOVE Starbucks but this one leaves a lot to be desired.. We have been here a hand full of time and each time I keep asking myself why do I go back to this one?   The service there is almost rude. They seem as if they are annoyed to be busy. They never seem to be happy to service you. Drinks take forever to make, even though they aren't as busy as other ones are. We won't even go into the fact that my order has been messed up the last 2 times.  The main issue I have is the fact that 3 out of 5 times when sitting and relaxing with a snack, someone has to sweep the floor near me. Really? While I am sitting there?  There are much better Starbucks and I think I am going to try some others locally.   12/06 - The kids and I went in today for our "snack" wanted to say things were better today. I am not going to change my rating until after my next visit ;)

Out of all the Cracker Barrels we have been to, this overall is the best!  Staff was efficient and friendly.  Drinks were filled regularly without being asked. Place looked clean :) Wish the fireplace was lit!  Food was consistent and hot. All orders were correct for a party of 6. Wish we lived closer to this location to come back more often.

This museum is located in downtown Mesa. Parking is right across the street which makes it very convenient! Parking is free which makes it even nicer :)  Admission is $10.00 per adult or should I say anyone 12 and over. I believe this is a fair price for a museum.  History is bountiful within the walls of this museum. The levels of history encompass everyone regardless of age. The kids (young ones) seem to enjoy the large dinosaurs that surround the rooms. There are several "hands on" areas for smaller children.   Teens have a lot to read about rocks, fossils, and history. I am sure you could spend hours walking around reading every last word, it does seem a little redundant and a lot to read.  Over all I think it's a nice museum, I just don't believe it is 5 Stars worth!

I would not only recommend - but plan to go them ONLY in the event we have another Pet emergency!  Gizmo is my 12 week puppy who had a broken jaw by our other pet when he was 7 weeks old. Dr. M has done nothing but be respectful, caring, loving, and concerned about not only Gizmo but us as a family also.  Here is a surgeon, who we were referred to, that felt that "surgery" was not the solution to the problem. Saving us thousands of dollars.  The compassion and care goes beyond words. Not one person has been disrespectful or rude since the day we entered.   There were weeks that I would go 2-3 times a week worried over little things, but yet they still took the time to see us, care for us, and help us.   Thank you for everything!

AWESOME festival! This is our 2nd year going and I will not miss it in the upcoming years!  Food is wonderful and not high priced considering you are at a festival.   Wear sneakers since you are in the dirt most of your journey through :)  If you didn't get a chance to check it out this year - I wouldn't miss it next year!

For hamburgers that are fresh, tasty, and cooked to order this has to be the BEST place in town!  Very packed during the lunch hour, so plan accordingly. With that being said, you open the door, stand in line and order.  As you approach the grill, you see your order cooking as you wait for it. Then you slide on down to the beverage station and get a drink. (I do believe they sell beer here)  After you pay and try to find a table you can than add your CONDIMENTS!  The Condiment Bar is always FRESH! You name it they have it!  If you don't do burgers that's OK too, they also have Hot Dogs and VEGGIE burgers!  Small menu - Big appetite!  Try to go after lunch around 1:30 and avoid on the weekends, especially since this is in college town Tempe.  Enjoy and let me know what you think when you try them out ;)

Went here to see Trans Siberian Orchestra!   Parking was good. We were free in handicap, however I think $10 is reasonable regardless. Parking appears to be ample for the area.  We had tickets on the floor (chairs) however I am not sure the price made it worth it. I think I could of saved $20 and had a seat in the stand and still have an awesome experience. My daughter (15) agreed.   Sound was great inside, very impressed.

Out of many libraries within Maricopa, this by far has to be one of the largest and well maintained libraries we have been to.  Five wonderful floors of BOOKS! A reader couldn't ask for anymore!  The concerns I have are primarily for safety since a lot of homeless tend to come in and want to hang out in the cool atmosphere for free in the library. This makes it hard with children, but most seem to over look the issue.   There are many computers for patrons to use that make it easy and convenient for those without a laptop.

Birthday party for my son - first time here pretty impressed so far. Spent the entire afternoon enjoying Amazing Jakes for my son's 13th Birthday Party.  Very cool place for kids. The only problem I had was that there are no lockers to put valuables for the adults. For the parents this means that someone is always stuck at the table watching the "stuff." I did happen to make the suggestion to the manager this evening while picking up the remainder of our birthday cake.  Over all very impressive place. Yes it's a little bit more than the average, but when you break it down it is worth it.  Age appropriate for 8 and up especially.

We have never owned a pool until we bought this home. With no experience we needed to find a place that could help us. Cactus Valley Pools has been helpful, informative, and even services our equipment that we bring into the shop.  They will check your water free and tell you what chemicals and how much to put in. The best part is the last 3 times I brought my water sample up to be tested, they were no problems at all!  Over all we are very happy here and hope that business here continues the same way.

Having 2 dogs, we spend a fortune in pet supplies. Than we must take into account the fact that Gizmo is a puppy and training is where we spend our days. Taking all that in we must than move forward to mention that we have 3 Salt water tanks in our house.  Aquatics here for Salt water is small but very useful and helpful! John will help you in any way shape or form, and he will even order you a particular fish if he doesn't have it in stock! Bill helps in aquatics also and has been a blessing when John isn't in.  Than our puppy trainer Alex is AWESOME! He truly loves the "dogs" and doesn't think it's just a job. Gizmo loves when he comes to visit him at the pet store for his puppy training class!   The store is stocked regularly, just ask me since boxes are everywhere on Wednesday's for puppy training!  Staff is very friendly - even Lisa waves to Gizmo when she walks by.  Even though this is a smaller location than some of the other Petco's it has to be one of the better locations I have been in!

December 5th - we came here for dinner and were very disappointed.    First was service lacked severely - eaiting took forever to come and get our food orders :(  Wasn't that busy.....  MIL meal was not placed with our meals, waiter forgot :((  When meal did come, MIL had mac and cheese with shrimp, 2 times returned still not hot.   Hubby and FIL had chili dogs. Both had chili on the side which was very dry and looked very lumpy. The buns were hard not fresh looking at all.  Watched manager/owner and other workers drink at the bar - big no-no!!  Filed conplaint and only comped the mac and cheese...   Needless to say we wint be bavk for a long time.....

Eat more Chicken?!  My favorite saying lately!!  Absolutely love this location on Power Road. Clean, convenient, and has to be the friendliest location I  have been to in awhile.  Love the Chicken Strips!!  Fries are OK - Usually they are not cooked all the way to my liking - this is ALL locations!  There Cheesecake is so fresh and moist my mouth is watering now!

If I could go for no stars - this place would be it!  Our order was for take out. Waited 15 minutes for our order, along with everyone else. Than once we received, I glanced in to the 3 bags - all looked good and we headed out.  Got home and we didn't have L2 or L3 and ended up with 2 ears of corn, dozen hush puppies, and not what we ordered.   Returned waited again just for someone to help me - was given correct order, was never compensated or apologized to.  We were not the only one with an incorrect order. There were 3 other people around us that were given the wrong order. Only the man in the Postal out fit got comped his meal, amazing!  Not going back again - it's just too frustrating.

Wow - very impressed on our first visit to AJ's Fine Foods!  When entering the store you are amazed by the smell of food. To our left was a wonderful bakery with some wonderful assortments of cakes, pies, and desserts. As we continued to roam, we went by the deli, soup bar, salad bar, and many other fine foods.   The store was clean and very friendly! Prices were higher than average stores, but you pay for what you get as they say!  We can not wait to come back and have lunch outside on the patio - serving BBQ!  Will definitely be coming back and knowing I will be taken care of.

I love Petco - and this particular one is better than some others I have been to.  Clean store - awesome staff who seem sincere when they help you. I never have to look far if I have a question.  I do wish the Salt Water area was larger, love to see the cats up for adoption.  Overall I think this is a nice Petco compared to others.

This is NOT your typical Pet Store!  With that being said, we were impressed when we entered inside to roam around the store. The first thing you notice when entering is all the cages and sounds inside.   Today was vaccination day so there were many dogs inside that seemed to wrap around the store.   We roamed around and found, turtles, birds, peacocks, baby turkeys, and even baby chicks! I was amazed to see the Peacocks and the Doves - they even had some homing pigeons!  Over all we were surprised by the store. Like I said not your typical pet store. If you are in the area please make sure to check them out!

Wow the smell or aroma as you enter the door is over whelming - YUM!  The kids and I were in the area today and wanted to try something new for lunch. We entered La Piazza and plan to come back, even though it is in the West Valley!  We ordered a standard cheese pizza. There were 6 slices = 2 slices each! The cheese was wonderful and you could tell it was fresh and we over heard it was made daily! The sauce was not tangy but very rich in flavor. The crust was not hard but yet firm to hold the sauce and cheese.   We decided to get a slice of cheesecake and some Zeppolis which are dough type doughnuts sprinkled with powdered sugar! OMW that was WONDERFUL!  We arrived about 11:30, there were about 3-4 tables occupied. By the time we left at 12:20 there were 7 people waiting in line for a table! Now mind you this appears to be a typical lunch on a Wednesday!   Unfortunately they are small, and they only have about 12 tables. I am not sure this is a bad thing, it just makes people realize how good of a place it is and it's cozy.  We will definitely be back and hope that others try it when you are on Glendale Ave.!

I have to say I was impressed with this location.   It was clean, busy, and staff seemed friendly.   My only peeve was that we waited in line because they only had one register. I think they should have opened another so we didn't have to wait to pay. They had the staff to do so.

Even though this particular Starbucks is not so close to home,  sometimes you have to venture out to get quality!   First off there was only 2 tables available! Everyone seemed happy and the feeli g of clutter didnt happen. Many tables and chairs which is very nice cor a change.  Ordered cookie crumble frap with milk rather than coffee. No problem. Very pleasant service! My drink came out quickly and perfect!!!  I will definately be back in the future! Hopefully passing out more #Gilbert23 decals ;)

I use to be the biggest fan of Applebee's. Now a days it's a place to get a meal, but nothing spectacular here.   This particular location has some of the worse service I have seen in a long time. The staff just doesn't seem to care about catering to their customers. Unfortunately, the food - no matter how good it may be is hurt by the staff and how they service their customers.   Lunch- they have the best soups and salads! Especially the Shrimp and Spinach salad with the tomato basil soup.  Dinner - the steak are good, not great, but they are tastier and reasonably priced.  Hopefully the staff will soon get the message other wise I will look for a new location for Applebee's.

Even though this isn't a large chain store like others, it has to be one of the easiest and friendly stores around.   The aisles are always clean. Produce always looks good here. I never need to search for things, since they are just a few products available per item.   Price for all natural is awesome compared to your NAME Brand stores. Absolutely love the fact that no hormones or additives are added to our meat! The best part is I don't even have to look to make sure!  Everyone is friendly - there is always someone here to help with check out also.   The only draw back is the carts are outside and in the summer time they get very HOT! Maybe a cover for the carts would help since there isn't any room in the store for them.

I love this place, it's convenient, good tasting, and cheap compared to other fast food establishments in the area.   Fries are sliced right there, using whole potatoes!  Burgers are cooked to order.  I love the SPREAD and always ask for extra packets for my dipping sauce for the fries. It's a taste of mayo, ketchup, and relish - YUM!  Waiting is my biggest complaint, but what can you do?  The best thing is if you haven't been or don't know - check out there SECRET menu online! Too die for!

Absolutely LOVE the archery facility at Paseo Vista.   The nice part is that their is covering for archers during set up and take down of equipment. This is a big advantage to a lot of archers, especially in the blistering sun of Arizona :)  The equipment is in fair condition but is replaced once it gets to a particular point of  no return. I absolutely love the fact that their targets are in place -  25 lanes out to 90 meters, 5 lanes out to 60 meters and 4 lanes out to 30 meters. This gives everyone an advantage :)  If you are looking into archery or already enjoy the sport, Check out Paseo and I am sure you will really enjoy it!

This has to be the busiest Costco I have ever seen! The aisles are nicely labeled. The aisles are efficient to get into, except for when all the snackers are trying to try the freebies ; )  I really think they need to hire more people at this location. You could wait for 20 minutes if not more to check out and that is the middle of the week! I cannot  imagine the weekends here!

They have really done a good job of keeping up with business. You have the ability to check in online before you arrive and see how long the waot is.  I  very pleased with Ryan and Ashleigh as stylist. They both go beyond the normal to help you look good. Thry like their jobs and it shows!  Prices are good ; coupons are available on your receipt for $1.00 after each haircut when you complete a survey.

I do not like this particular Petsmart at all and hope that they make some changes.  First off the fact that they have 1 door next to the register they seem to use makes it hard to get in and out, especially with a pet.  Secondly, the main aisle in the store does not allow but 1 person in it. If someone is looking at the Martha Stewart stuff, then someone has to wait until they move to get around them or have to go down a different aisle to get somewhere.  The grooming department is good, but nothing special. Most employees don't seem happy to be there. I feel like it's mass confusion when dropping off my pet or picking up afterwards.  I have never used VCA there so I can not voice a thought at that end.

Previous experience has not been the best in the past, but I must say food, service, and price was awesome tonight!  The 1/2 version of cookie is awesome  and is a MUST!

This particular location isn't as busy as the location in Tempe. Why that is, I am not sure considering it is sitting across the street from the mall.  Over all the food and service is very good. Very attentive and food is HUGE! No matter what you order, it's tough to finish.  Bakery has a lot to offer anyone who comes in. Bagels are fresh in the morning, but I would not recommend purchasing after 11AM.  The cream cheese is awesome, which we brought home tonight.

Over all this has to be one of the better Walmarts I have been in. Store always seems clean, staff seems nice. No complaints!

One of the cleanest libraries in the East Valley!  Staff is very helpful, even if you have to wait in a line.   Many options available for patrons. Nice little book store in front to purchase books. Bathrooms are clean and well maintained.   We love coming to this library!

PS Yogurt is awesome! Flavors are changed out regularly. Toppings are a large variety!   Best part about them is that if you sign up for the text messages - they give you discounts!  Awesome place + awesome people = Awesome Family Hot Spot!

They just opened and this was my 2nd visit!  LOVE the donuts, fresh even at 3:00 in the afternoon. Wonderful variety of donuts including smoothies, hot coffee, and bagels!  Staff has to be the friendliest I have seen in awhile.   Shop is not fancy but very clean. My oldest daughter even checked out the bathroom this afternoon and I have been told "very nice Mom!"  If you haven't come in to try them, you should!

WOW!   When walking in I was surprised to see such a small place, but I can't wait to see them when they are forced to expand!!!  Hubby got a create your own hot dog (ALL BEEF) and create your own burger with Garlic BBQ sauce. Both of them were awesome!  Teenage daughter got a create your own burger with sweet BBQ sauce - AWESOME!  Teenage son got a plain hot dog - very good!  I got a Giovanni Burger - OH MY WORD!!!! WONDERFUL!!! it consisted of burger, sauteed mushrooms, onions, and peppers and the garlic BBQ sauce. It was not over cooked and wonderful!  We also had the fries which were good, golden to perfection but not over cooked. The Onion rings were not to our liking, hubby ate them, said they were ok, but not like we expected them to be.  DESSERT - Fried Apple Fries were SINFUL! These aren't your frozen sliced apples, no they are FRESH apples EVERYDAY! Dipped in whip cream and caramel! Than we also got our (free) Yelp coupon for the Funnel Fries which were very good, but just don't compare to the apples.  Bathroom were very clean and I was happy with how the staff was friendly and very informative when we asked some questions.   I hope this place is around for a long time! They are terrific!

What can I say - When this Sky Train is complete, it will be very convenient for all moving around the airport! You will even be able to go to station at 44th St for the Light Rail!

The grand opening was yesterday and we were there tonight!   My son got a $5.00 Large 1 topping pizza. He said it was good and ended up eating 1/2 of a large pizza!  I did the Provolone Cheese steak. Very good! Filled with lots of meat, peppers, onions, and Mayo! The bread wasn't soggy even though it was a little messy. I do think the peppers could be cooked a little more, they were crunchy and I don't like them like that. I will retry on the next visit.  Hubby got a steak, cheese, and mushroom. He said it was very good. He got the Onion rings and was disappointed. They were greasy and not as good as the one in Tempe.   We also got an order or cheese bread and it was awesome.  The can probably hold about 25 inside and they have tables outside which is where we sat since the weather was so nice.  Over all I wish them the best of luck and plan to go back again.

Babbo's here is Far East Mesa opened on Monday. With that being said - we arrived tonight around 6:00 to a packed house!  We were seated promptly and our waiter arrived within a few minutes for drink orders. The wine and alcohol list was long. We settled for sodas and tea.   We were than brought a basket if bread with oil and balsamic. Wonderful, warm and fresh.  The kids and I ordered the traditional cheese pizza. The pizza was not greasy or over cooked. The sauce was flavorful but not too rich.   Hubby had chicken fettuccine and the portion was large. See photos. He said it was one of the best he has had.   Bathrooms were very nice and seemed well kept.  The only thing I saw that will need some work is keeping an eye on drinks (refills) when they are very busy. The manager walked by and realized 3 out of 4 drinks were empty and quickly filled them.   Overall we will be back! I really enjoyed the dinner and service was good. Hoping they have a successful business and around a long time.

I have been here on three separate occasions twice has been with Tiffany and the last time with Tammy. I have to say I'm truly impressed prices might be a little high but the service is well worth the cost.  I will continue to service them to get my nails done I like their designs the choice of colors and I think the ladies there are really really genuine.

So with all the hype in Scottsdale -another Portillo's has opened in Tempe for us East Valley peeps!  All I can say is what a fun and sassy place it is! While we drove into the parking lot we saw some officers directing traffic which made it nice. Once we were parked, we were impressed with all the outside seating with misters.... Everyone knows it's HOT here!  When we walked in we were overwhelmed with all the people and quickly realized that we needed to get in line to order. While we stood there a man came up and asked us if we were ready to order, and I said no since I hadn't even had a chance to look at the menu :? So he quickly got us a menu and we decided and got in line to be greeted by a wonderful young lady who tool our order on a bag! Than we were handed our bag and headed to the line to check out. Less than 5 second wait and we stepped into the Pick up line.... Daughter went to the Salad line to get her Salad :)  Within approximately 4 minutes they called our random number for our food and off to the table we went!  We all dug into our food!  I had the Italian Beef (DIPPED!), with mozzarella and onions and a side of onion rings. Hubby had the Hot dog with mustard, yellow onion, and pickle, along with a Combo Beef and Char-Grilled Sausage and a side of fries. DD got the Garden salad, and DS got Chicken Tenders and Fries....  I enjoyed mine a lot! Very flavorful. I do think the onion rings might need a different type of batter, just not the way I like them.  Hubby loved his completely! I think the fries could have been cooked or browned a little more - Personal preference.... DD loved her salad, very fresh! DS did not care for his chicken fingers :(  Next time I asked him to try something else :)  Over all I think this is a great addition to the area. I had the opportunity to talk to Sharon (owner) and saw Dick Portillo walking and mingling with guests. You can see they are taking a lot of pride int heir new establishment and I can't wait to come back to Portillo's!

Our first trip to MOD Pizza will be our last trip unfortunately. Three of us went in and ordered various size pizzas on the created their own all three came out burned on the bottom and the top was a little black on my onions especially. This tells me that the temperature of their grill is too high. Unfortunately I just didn't see them outweighing any other pizza companies even though their price is much lower. I think I'll stick to traditional pizza in the future.
