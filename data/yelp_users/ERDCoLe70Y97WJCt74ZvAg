I started going to Darling Nails two and a half years ago.  I love it.  I have now introduced my family and they love it too!

Love this place and Andy is the bomb! Always good but our sushi chef Andy went above and beyond to make our last experience even better. He recommended and added suggestions that put his sushi over the top, we'll definitely come back just to see what else he has in his pocket!

This is one of my favorite places to go for me time!  Enlighten never disappoints you and you will always feel like a million bucks when you leave!  My son refuses to get his hair cut anywhere else!  ;-)

This is a very fun, creative, and healthy way to enjoy enchiladas.  While the setup does have a Chipotle-type feel, the ingredients are more unique.  I especially liked the oven element to warm your tasty enchilada.  My biggest complaint, there was not enough parking and seating was a challenge.  Notwithstanding, I will go back!

I had mother's day brunch at Barrelhouse, and the food was excellent.  A new favorite eating spot for Chandler!

The spicy shrimp with mixed vegetables are super yummy!  Beef lo mein was a bit disappointing although the noodles were flavorful.  Overall, the Jade Palace is a bit pricey for takeout but worth the price if dining in.

My son and I went in last Saturday to make a cake purchase for my son's birthday.  I had previously purchased two cakes from this bakery in the past.  To say the service on Saturday was rude is an absolute understatement.  The person handling the cake order did not provide any type of direction nor pricing on the cake.  The service was rushed and the person appeared to be annoyed when any questions were asked.  After my son had picked out what he wanted, I was absolutely astonished when the person taking the order indicated that the cake was $180 for 30 people.    When my son asked for a cup of water with his cupcake, the person at the counter was rude after a seemingly large purchase -- I had also ordered a coffee which was finally offered to me as I was walking out of the bakery after being there for over 15 minutes.  My sister went in today to make changes to the cake which is not scheduled to be ready until Saturday and was told that because I had already paid in full, there could be no changes made to the cake.  It was further told to her that if we were to go somewhere else it was fine because I had already paid for the cake.  Next cake order, I will go elsewhere.

Definitely save your money if your child is six years or more.  The dinosaur figures are fun for younger kids but were too immature for my 6 year old.  All activities were too young and a bit cheesy.  The advertising is definitely misleading.  For what you pay, it is not worth it!
