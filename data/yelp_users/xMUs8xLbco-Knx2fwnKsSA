Waitress tried to rip us off. Bill was $81 and half our party paid $40! Waitress tried to hand me a $61 dollar receipt. Glad my son who is a server caught it. Unbelievable I won't be back after that trick!

Great hotel, we stayed in the Rush Tower Suites and they were beautiful. Great choice of food options and very friendly staff. Pool is top notch and shark tank is pretty neat!  Only ding is noise, it was very noisy on the 12th floor even being opposite of fremont street.  Probably would stay again if I was to stay on that end of the strip, however we prefer the big strip.

Stayed here for 10 days this month. Had a great experience with everything except for my bill. I asked for a totaled up bill my second night and was given one amount. The night before I was checking out I asked to pay my bill in full. The two amounts varied and when questioned about it I was advised they may have comped a few days for me. Now when I checked out online there was an additional 200 charge. I went to the front desk and asked what the charge was they said it was for my final night. I spent 2 hours in person and on the phone complaining only to be told sorry! We don't give credits or refunds due to our staff making mistakes!! Seriously? Guess my 10 day stay didn't mean anything or the meals I ate at the casino or the clients I entertained. Sorry Flamingo you blew this one.

Wonderful dinner last night, the fish and chips are awesome. Friday nights it's all you can eat for $10.95. My wife liked the small British store for treats and goodies. We definitely plan on being back.

Normally a great dining experience, today not so much. 15 minute wait for a waiter to even show up at our table. Flagged down another waiter to get us a drink. Manager came out and apologized. Daughters glass was dirty and had to be sent back. Manager again came out and apologized. Got our bill and nothing was comped? Not expecting a free meal but geeze at least com our ice teas.

Not ever going back, I ordered a #5 combo and asked if I could pay the difference to upgrade my medium coffee to a cafe latte. Young lady behind the counter said sure thing. She charged me the full price for a cafe Latte on top of the number 5 combo, I questioned this as my order seemed more expensive than I anticipated. I was advised they don't substitute for the combos. SO basically they charged me for a medium coffee I didn't get. I think I'll find another place to get breakfest in the mornings.

Came here today for Mothers Day, absolutely the worst service and food I've had in a long time. My wife's French fries were cold and when we asked to have them replaced they brought out ones just as cold. My daughters chicken tenders were rubbery. The fried pickles were good unfortunately that's where it ended. Definitely will not be back which is Sad because the location decor and patio are great.

been visiting The Australian AZ since October of 2013. Good drinks and the food is enjoyable. I am concerned that it seems very empty some nights. Even on a Saturday during NFL playoffs the bar was half full. I'd suggest bringing in a live band on the weekends to jazz it up. I'm fearful the bar wont last another few months if it doesnt pick up soon.

Stopped in during our recent stay at the Golden Nugget to have breakfast. It was a Tuesday morning at 9am. The restaurant appeared to be 3/4 full. The wait for beverage service was 10+ minutes. A quick scrambler breakfast and French toast took almost 20 minutes to receive. Great food just really long wait times, 2nd time eating at this restaurant in 6 months. Will not be back when travelling thru Vegas for business I don't want to wait for food when there are multiple options.

Great selection, was very excited to see that they offered Kolaches! I thought the prices were average but the selection is amazing!
