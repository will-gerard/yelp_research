Cute little tiny place, with big future ahead! The girl working was really nice and friendly. My bf is from Hawaii and he misses it so much. This is the only Hawaiian restaurant I know that sells laulau. Found them on Groupon and this is our first try getting food there (ordered to go cuz it's already late) and we loved it there! Prices were affordable and reasonable. Music was awesome! Perfect with the theme they got going. We are definitely coming back to dine in next time for sure when we have time it was almost a 40minute drive! I gave 4 stars because it was a bit of a drive.. If only they were by Phoenix or somewhere closer downtown ^_^

We come here almost EVERY Thursdays night because of their awesome "BAND/karaoke" night and the staff is usually chill and cool..   The last time we were here (just me and my bf), we ordered chicken wings, nachos, pizza, mozzarella sticks, southwest rolls, French dip & drinks from the bar.   Got called up to sing up on stage. Took our food to a table close to the stage.. and when we came back, no more than 5minutes later, all our food was gone. I confronted the girl that was cleaning up our table and told her that "We weren't done yet..", all of the plates weren't even empty at all and she didn't even turn around to look at me and all she said was "oh well.." And CONTINUED what she was doing!! I WAS HELLA SURPRISED OF HOW RUDE THAT GIRL WAS WHEN I APPROACHED HER NICELY.  I talked to the lady bartender right away, who by the way is just always super sweet and nice to everyone, talked to the manager that night about the incident and the manager came to talk to me but didn't apologize (I'm guessing he was busy running around the whole placer hat  ) , but the lady bartender was apologizing for the girl's mistake, and the manager said he'll take 50% off everything we ordered that was thrown away so we still paid, I guess since we did eat some of the food that was thrown away, when I'm almost 99.9% sure most restaurants would have comped that if this was the situation but he didn't, maybe he's a new manager. But we just wanted to get out of there so we paid without anymore conflicts.   My bf and I used to worked in the food&beverage industry and we know it's really not just the food that makes the guests come back but the hospitality of the staff and service too.

Ordered a last minute birthday cake for my mom and luckily, Sugarlips Cakery was able to accommodate my request of the customized bday cake in such a short notice (like ordered today, need it tomorrow night. -__-') in a very reasonable price The staff were friendly and very helpful.  The cake was a hit! Everyone loved the cake specially my mom! Definitely got some inquiry where I got the cake and of course I told them where. Highly suggest this place! The cake was not only very detailed in design (even though it's simply just Sully's fur) but the cake tasted really good (red velvet). I will for sure order future cakes here again and let my friends know about it! Thanks for the cake you guys! There was no left overs at the bar because everyone loved it!

I honestly don't remember the last time I've gone to a phone repair shop leaving content and not feeling robbed so I was kinda skeptic getting my phone screen fixed from a bad experience with this other store that I've gone to replace my iPhone's broken screen before, which took atleast an hour to fix the screen while u wait in awkward silence. Once I left the store with my fixed screen no more than 30minutes had passed, I realized the power button didn't spring back up & when I called them about it, they wanted me to pay $50 when it hasn't even been THAT LONG after I left AND I never had that problem before I took my phone to their shop!! So since then, I've never gotten my phone fixed, I would just wait and buy a new iPhone   UNTIL 1 of my friends told me about QuickFix! QuickFix have this 30 days guarantee and unlike other phone repair shops, this store really means business when it comes to quality service :) and Steven here at QUICKFIX really fits the name of their store with the repair service he provided while being careful & making sure everything on my iPhone was working right! It literally took me longer to drive to the store than him replacing my shattered screen lol. I was only in there less than 20minutes, and it felt less because of the friendly staff. I highly recommend and will definitely be coming back for their business.
