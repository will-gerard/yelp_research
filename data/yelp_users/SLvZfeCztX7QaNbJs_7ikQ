My husband works in the office building the Bean is located in, so we happen to frequent quite often.  Sometimes lunch, sometimes just a snack after work, and on rare occasion we grab breakfast there.  Their muffins are absoultely wonderful; especially the cinnamon chocolate crunch.  The croissant menu is fabulous, and the grilled cheese is delish.  My very favorite part of the Bean?  Ginger Peach Iced Tea.  Oh yes!  It is to die for. Tends to be pricey, but I'm hooked on the $2.50 iced tea, so what can you do.

My husband and I are the biggest wing fans you'll meet.  We've tried a lot of places, and by far - this is my favorite.  They make their wings a little crispy, but I love that.  GREAT food, fast service.

This place was such a wonderful experience.  My husband and I went here on Cinco de Mayo.  The ambiance is amazing, the food is yummy (but spicy), and the chips and salsa are AMAZING.  You won't regret going here!!

While I will admit that I can sometimes be overly picky when it comes to chinese food, this place was AWFUL!  I ordered Orange Chicken, expecting a dark glazed piece of fried chicken with a spicy bite at the end, and what I received were fried chicken pieces with orange juice poured on top.    I was told this was by far the best chinese food in Phoenix, and I couldn't disagree more.  Take my advice - go somewhere else!

Homestyle italian food and great ambiance.  The wait staff is pleasant, service is great, and the food couldn't be any better.  It's affordably priced, and if you order off of the classics menu, you get a full size 2nd plate to take home with you.  Seriously, how could it get better!?

All I can really say is WOW!  I absolutely love this place... The Carne Adovada is by far my favorite, and a close second is the Spicy Asiago chicken.  The service is always great, and the renovations they've made to the joint are wonderful - it's really a very pleasant place to visit.

This place is pretty incredible.  The california club and the breakfast buzz are probably the best items on the menu IMO... but seriously, you can't go wrong.  The only thing I've had that I didn't really care for is the Breakfast Burrito, but that was because it was just a little boring compared to the other choices on their menu.  It's a long wait in the drive thru 99% of the time, but it is absolutley MORE than worth it.

This was such a fun evening.  Family friendly, so take your kids, take your girlfriend on a date, etc etc.  The owner, Jeff, is always there, always entertaining, and I was leave with a smile on my face.  It takes so much talent to do an improv show, and this is by far the best I've seen.  Can't wait to go again.  Check in on Yelp or Facebook and get a free item from there snack bar.

I am not gonna lie.  I don't get the Sprinkles buzz.... I think they are dry, boring, and not worth the money.  My opinion, drive north a few more miles to CupCakes...

As an update, I've visited Sprinkle's 2x more since my first review, and both times they were SO much better.  I still don't like the chocolate cakes, but there are many other flavors that are pretty darn good. :)

Went here for happy hour last night - Half price apps and $3 beers, can't beat that.  My husband ordered the soft pretzels, which we super fresh and definitely handmade onsite.  Came with mustard and cheese sauce, excellent!  I ended up eating most of it :)  We got some Fried Pickles, which aren't part of the happy hour special, but are only $4 and worth it.  Everything we got was great, and the atmosphere is even better.

Loved Zona Hotel!  We had a King Suite with a living room,  kitchen and dining room. It was spacious and well priced. The pool is beautiful,  large, and heated. Still a little cool for a January evening, so we stuck to the hot tub, but all in all a great area to relax and rejuvenate.  We loved our trip and would definitely go back.

My typical dish of choice is Orange Chicken with Fried Rice.  It's AMAZING.  I wish I could afford to eat every meal there...  I no longer live in Laveen, but I will be travelling back to Laveen (and who wants to do that) just to have lunch/dinner at my favorite chinese place in Phoenix.  YUMMY!

Went to this location last week - was nervous to go because although I love waffles, and fried chicken, the idea of eating them together freaked me out.  But my husband is a huge fan, so I decided to suck it up.  I'm glad I did... Although I typically prefer my waffles a little crispier than LoLo's makes them, the flavor was to die for!!!  And who doesn't love some delicious fried chicken!  I know I do.... Try it!  You'll love it!

Ate here with my cousin and my husband.  We ordered fried zucchini and shared a pizza.  The zucchini was awesome, had just enough crisp without being burned.  The pizza was very authentic, absolutely fantastic.  We will definitely check it out again.

I can't say enough about Dr. Clyde. He was patient and informative.  I have never felt like I "needed" glasses, I always had a prescription that was maybe a little better than without, but never had a wow moment putting on a new pair. Well, I just got my new pair prescribed by him, and I literally said "oh my gosh!" When I put them on. Thank you SO much Dr. Clyde. You have gained a lifelong customer!

Can't believe I'm the first one to write a review!!  Christy and her team designed our wedding cake back in March, and also made my birthday cake in December.  My birthday cake and the extra sheet cake for the wedding were both Carrot Cake.  It was the perfect mix of cinnamon/nutmeg flavors with the heartiness of carrot.  By far my favorite carrot cake ever!  Our wedding cake was Canoli Cake - white cake filled with canoli cream and chocolate chips.  SERIOUSLY?  In what world could that ever be bad?!  It was fantastic, so fantastic that I went to a separate area to eat my slice so I wouldn't be bothered by wedding guests trying to talk to me.  No lie.    As for service - we literally called Christy and the shop weekly to make sure they had our order.  We were so paranoid that it just wouldn't show up on our wedding day.  They were always so sweet and totally understanding of us being a little overbearing.  Each time we talked she confirmed our order, and was never rude or seemed irritated we were calling AGAIN.  I can't wait to order from them again!

Maybe one of my all time favorite burgers! I got mine lettuce wrapped, the bbq char, and this is a place that does lettuce wrapping right! Plenty of wrap to hold the burger, and not have to use a fork/knife, but you can still enjoy all the flavor of burger!! Very fine line! Perfect burger for my low carb habits! My kiddo had fries, and they weren't super hot, not totally impressive, but I also wouldn't call them bad. Hubs had the double char lettuce wrapped, which was just as delicious. Very yummy tropical tea as well! The best thing about this location though, the service was excellent. Several attentive workers grabbing trash and asking if we needed anything! Although busy, everyone had smiles and it felt like we were the only people in the restaurant. I will definitely go again!

My husband and I were married at TreBella in March.  Every step of the way was a wonderful experience for us.  We visited an open house a little over a year before our wedding.  We were greeted by Kim and her husband/the bartender/the backup DJ, Jim, who were both very sweet and helpful.    We fell in love with the venue immediately.  It is stunningly chic, modern, with just the right amount of fancy to make it suitable for a formal occasion.  They have an awesome man cave with TV, big comfy chairs, and they have a beautiful Bride's room with a big leopard chair, and lots bathroom, fridge, and lots of room for you and your girls to dress.  The day of the wedding was quite a whirlwind, but Kim was absolutely wonderful as our Day Of Coordinator.  She doubled as a cocktail waitress for us and got us drinks before and after the ceremony, as well as during the reception.  She made sure to take care of everything for us and keep us on schedule so the day runs smooth.  Mike was an DJ and he did an awesome job and played exactly the styles we asked him to.  We got so many compliments on how beautiful our wedding was, how nice all the employees were, and how wonderful the food was. We are so glad we found TreBella.  It was all inclusive pricing, at a fraction of the cost.  We paid about 6500 for 75 people all inclusive. (food, linens, cake, champagne toast, open bar, dj, bartenders, wait staff, hand passed hors d'eurves, centerpieces, etc.)   Bottom line: Get a red-carpet style event, for a backyard bbq price.  You won't be sorry!

The best BBQ I've had - and I lived in Texas for a bit.  Tender and delicious meat and the best potato salad.  Just delicious!

After a long trip to the nearby Hobby Lobby, I was looking for a treat before my 25 minute drive home.  Nothing Bundt Cakes is conveniently located amist all kinds of shopping. When I walked in I was greeted by a young girl with a smile, who seemed to really want to help me get what I needed.  They had samples of their flavor of the month, which was White Chocolate Blueberry.  Absolutely heavenly!!  I ended up buying 3 of the bundtettes.  Chocolate chocolate chip, white chocolate blueberry, and cinnamon swirl.  I go nuts for anything cinnamon, so that was a front runner for me.  Perfect balance of cinnamon and cake.  Chocolate one was just a little too chocolately for my liking, but moist and tasty nonetheless.  The -1 star is only because I think they are a little pricey.  But for the occasional treat, I won't complain!

The two stars are only because the guys are nice. However, we went in and asked how much it would cost to have a bike fixed. All we needed was seat and handle bars tightened. We were told it'd be no more than 10 bucks.  So, we brought the bikes in. When we got there we were told that we'd have to get the safety check and that was $38. we wanted our bikes to be safe since we'll have a trailer for my daughter on the back so we decided to go through with it.  well when we picked the bikes up the seat still moved and the handlebars fell right down, and we are $38 poorer. what a waste.
