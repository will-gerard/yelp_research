Absolutely great dentist and staff. Unfortunately my insurance isn't covered there anymore...I would continue to go if it was. Very nice office to visit.

The girls that work there have marbles for brains. Apparently 16 isn't the age to start working. We have tried this place three times and each time they couldn't input the address right. And hour and 15 minutes later they said they didn't have any record of it being ordered!! This happened 3 TIMES! The best part when I asked to speak to the manager the girl says she's the closest thing they got and hangs up on me! Those nits should be let go and hire people that can function and not be rude little girls to customers.

They have great food! Perfect blend of holy matrimony is what I'm told. I always order jade chicken with a Chile reino hope I spelled that right... But they user the huge Chiles not the tiny jalapeno like huge ! It hangs over your plate! God this place is good, and considering I don't really like Mexican food that says alot. Oh and I have a really bad cinnamon allergy so they were super nice and substituted the snicker doodle cookie for me  ;-)

My lovely Japanese friend is always inviting me to the latest and greatest of finds and this one is great. I have no idea what anything was called and I have never had dim sum but this was great! the best was this custard cookie thing, my good it was amazing.... So I recommend it. I just pointed to stuff on the carts and it seamed to work.

Hey this is my place to drink. Great drinks, I can literally hand them my phone and say can I have that drink and they will make it perfect. Haven't been to the gambling/outside part I usually stick with the bar. The careens are very laid back get my drinks quick and the food is pretty good but when I'm drunk it's the best food ever. I recommend it because it's a mix of all people, ghetto, classy, average and everyone gets along. I mostly love it because it's walking distance haha.

Really for a Mexican fast food chain you can't go wrong with their cheap food. Delish and it will give you instant food baby. I adore their fresh salsa bar. The only down side is the front cashier. I watched her open up someone's food poke around a little bit on their burrito trying to figure out which kind it was and then wrap it back up. She wiped the food from her finger nail on her pants. My burrito was good and unscathed from her dirty appendage. My suggestion is watch your food from order to pickup.

I like coming here for cheap, fast, delicious Chinese food. The owner is almost always there smiling and glad customers are there. It's cute. I really just like Chinese food that is more authentic than panda express, so here is my place. Everything is hot, and made to order.  ;-)

I give it for because they have an amazing wine selection! But they need to work on their portions it's bad when you order pricy food and then go home and cook... It's good food just more for presentation not dining. The wait is pretty long most of the time it's just expected for this place.

They were low pressure sales. We bought a very expensive bedroom set and got it home to find cracks in the wood and drawers not working. I called less than 24 hours later they said they would send out a tech to fix it in a week!!! You can't fix cracks in the wood only FILL them so they are just trying to cosmetically fix their shitty furniture.
