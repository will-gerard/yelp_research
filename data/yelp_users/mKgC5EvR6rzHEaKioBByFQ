My boyfriend brought me here for a reservation at 9pm on September 3rd for my birthday. It was my first time experiencing the place and I loved it! The drinks were delicious, the food excellent, and the price was what I expected. Our server was Dallas and she was absolutely wonderful! This girl knows how to make her customers feel welcomed and relaxed! And she was fun!   Thank you for a great birthday, Melting Pot!

Absolutely the best experience I've had going to the dentist. Every single staff member at this office is beyond wonderful. This was my first dentist visit in a long time and I'm very confident in saying I've found my new dentist!

I came here to get a gel manicure by Bea and she did a phenomenal job. She was courteous and professional and I was very pleased.  I ended up getting my hair cut and colored there later and loved it.  I want to say my stylist what Beth or Bethany.  Great customer service and I thought the prices were reasonable.

Went in today to get my septum done by Richard and he was awesome! He was very professional, comforting, and talked me through it every step of the way.  He was informative with aftercare and just all around an awesome guy. I won't go anywhere else but HTC for piercings!

Great customer service, however I was disappointed on the job done to my car. I came in for an oil change, belt replacement, and AC charge. When I got my car back they had done a tire rotation but I now had a low tire. The AC charge cost me $60 but it did not help the AC blow any cooler and caused my car to make a very unsettling rattling noise when idling.  The belt must have been adjusted incorrectly because it started to squeal again 2 days after I got it back from being replaced. I called them and they told me to bring it back in so I did. I had to go to work so I let them know my boyfriend and his mother were going to pick it up. They didn't give him any information as to what had to be refixed on the car.  I would have definitely appreciated more communication from them and a more thorough job. I don't usually have a negative experience at Fletchers but I don't think I'll be returning to this location.

Such a cute little place! The small menu is great, the food is delicious, and the tea is incredibly refreshing. Love this place.

I don't have anything bad to say about this place, they did good job. But I wasn't blown away or super impressed.  The service was friendly, the place was clean and it was pretty busy so I know they get business. I got a pedicure and the young man did a decent job with the paint and the massage.  Again, nothing bad to say about them.

I actually really love this place. However, the last time I was in there (tonight) they were either short staffed or the bartender sucked. We got our first beers and played some video games and trivial pursuit. She didn't come check on us at all.  We wanted to order food and more beer but we never got a chance to. We finished our beers and had empty glasses on the edge of the table and she still didn't come check on us. We ended up just leaving cash on the table and booking it. We had planned on spending money and a good chunk of our evening there but poor service tends to deter you.  What really sucks is that I took my boyfriend there for the first time after telling him how cool the place was, and he was not impressed at all.  Money lost for the business unfortunately. :(

Not a fan. Delivery was super fast but the food was very bland. The fried rice had no flavor, my shrimp was really undercooked, and the egg drop soup needs salt. Most likely won't order from them again.

I used to use the facility up at Carefree and enjoyed it. I since moved and this one is closer to my house, however I'm pretty disappointed with it. For being a new gym I'm surprised at how poorly maintained and cleaned the cardio equipment is. I like using the eliptical and stair climber however they are always filthy, stuff spilled all over and the tvs are all half broken. Not that that's why I go there but it helps pass the time of my cardio workout. I couldn't find small medicine balls anywhere. They had huge ones, but I'm a fairly petite person and could not easily manage those. I feel they have too high of a membership for it's size. I love mountainside however I feel they need some major training for the staff at this one. Pretty disappointed.

I've been here before on a weekend and had an excellent experience. Tonight was a completely different story and I'm a little shocked. We came in with a group for my friend's birthday for ladies night because we thought everyone would have fun. The bartenders were decent, at least to the females, but the males felt like they were acting a bit cold to them. I've never seen that before so I was a little taken aback by the behavior. We ignored it. However, we didn't know the dj wasn't taking requests. One of our group asked if he could play a song. He asked what it was, she answered, and his response was "have you heard any hip hop played here tonight?" I'm sorry, but that is not the proper response WHATSOEVER to a paying customer that didn't realize there was a specific theme that had to be followed for the evening. I was standing there when he interacted with her and he was not only rude but incredibly condescending. Which is not ok in the least bit. DJ Rey or whoever he was, is not equipped to speak with people on a customer service level. He could have nicely let her know he wasn't taking requests or he had a genre to follow. Again, we let it go at that point. What really upsets me is that I informed the bartenders as we were closing out that the dj was incredibly rude to us and their response was "Oh ok, well I'll tell him."  No apology offered, no nothing. I'm just surprised that my previous experience turned into this major disappointment in service. And I doubt I'll be returning.
