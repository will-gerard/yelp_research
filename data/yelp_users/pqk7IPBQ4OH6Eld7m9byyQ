I ordered 20 piece chicken nuggets, sweet tea, and french fries. I ask for extra ranch and it's almost 30 cents for ONE small ranch. To top it off the chicken nuggets were stale, french fries were rock hard, and the tea was more ice than tea. Never going back to this location.

I absolutely love it here and can vouch for these amazing artists. I have work done by boomer and toons and they are both amazing. I am doing a whole horror sleeve with toons and every single tattoo has came out amazing. I get compliments everywhere I go. I have not gotten work done by the other artist but I see what they do and they are just as amazing. I won't ever go to another shop again.
