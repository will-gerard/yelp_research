I have been to several chiropractors and have never had such an amazing treatment.  I had a dislocated rib and vertebrae, didn't know they could do that, he put me right in 3 trips!!! He found several problems i didn't even know I had. I have referred 6 friends to him and they are referring their friends. I highly recommend Peter to everyone in the valley!!!!

You can never go wrong with native! Long live native honey hot wings! I used to come here almost once every two weeks and why the hell have I stopped?!?   This place is the bomb-diggity! The beer God's are alway flowing with cold ones and the wings are always lip-smacking awesome. They also apparently added dry-rubs flavors as wing options but I wasn't in for trying a new flavor, I'll leave it for others more daring. However I wish they never got rid of the curly fries as those were my favorite(even our server agreed), definitely a sad day to all native curly fry lovers.   The atmosphere was pretty chill and a great place to have a guys night with big screen TV's galore. Apparently it's also the place to be for trivia night on Fridays as it was jam-packed. With it being such a busy night (and I realized Fridays are busy) the food and drinks came out fast, a plus service in my book.   I'll see you again before I two weeks my long life friend, native!

This place is great! The staff does a phenomenal job, very fun and energetic atmosphere. Tam is by far my favorite of the ladies that work there, always happy and thorough in her work! Highly recommend this establishment!

Olive garden is always a bit of a crap shoot when it comes to service, but this one is really impressive. There is a dairy allergy in our group, I know I know we chose Italian, the wait staff made sure everyone was aware of it, the manager even came out to personally cover the dairy menu AND even offered to whip something up using what ever the kitchen had! Simply outstanding, well done Olive Garden, we will definitely return!

I have seen this place several times and I really enjoy Hawaiian food, but I was thoroughly unimpressed. I ordered the Ohana plate. Teriyaki chicken, Mahi Mahi and coconut shrimp. The flavor was pretty decent across the board, but everything was really dry, and they really don't have a very good selection of sauces to choose from. The shrimp seemed like it had come out of the freezer aisle at your local grocery store, no pop just breaded with the slightest hint of coconut. The white rice was probably the best part, and that's just it unflavored white rice, and the macaroni salad with all of its ingredients just fell flat. The service was pretty typical nothing to complain about there. It does have a lot of the clich√© decor, surfboards and such.   Overall I have had worse, but definitely do not see myself returning, quite disappointing as its about 2 minutes from my home.

Club west is one of my favorites in the valley. Its a great course, some beautiful views and amazing holes.  The new restaurant is quite good.  The staff is very friendly and quite helpful. Recommend to anyone who wants to play a course with a bit of challenge and amazing views.

You can definitely tell by other Oregano's reviews I am a huge fan of their food!!!   But tonight's experience was simply AMAZING!!! the food was awesome, but the service was TOP NOTCH!!  One of the people in our party has a dairy allergy, I know I know we went to an Italian restaurant cheese cheese cheese, but our waitress Gina knew the answer to our allergy questions, everything from the bread to the sauces, she even pointed our an item we had ordered that had dairy mixed into it and got us a different dressing!!!!  Gina you made this one of the most enjoyable outings I've had in a long time.

Del taco is great for eating on a budget.  You pay a reasonable amount for the food you get and i can never finish it all.  Great place for food after a night of drinking.  Definitely thumbs up from this guy!

Such a great place for food and drinks, minus the whole packer bar :), love going on Fridays for trivia, always good to chill and tear up the all you can eat fish! Staff is friendly, like most places on busy nights they can get backed up but my glass is never empty! Keep it up! Ashley is by far the best waitress on staff!

I had never even noticed this place.  A friend of mine took me here and I was completely blown away.  Such a huge building packed full of home decor items as well as outdoor decor.  Most places I just browse because things like these are usually ridiculously priced, but not garden ridge.  the prices were great and the selection was amazing, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone, there wasn't much in the way of staff that I noticed, which is good for me, so you can shop peacefully with out being bothered.

Very nice location. They had quite a wide selection of items to meet just about anyone taste, and everything was reasonably priced. The men's clothing selection was rather small, but there was tons of women's clothing, furniture and home supplies were plentiful. Would definitely recommend to anyone!
