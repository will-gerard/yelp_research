Horrible service and food. Worst beef Enchilada I have ever had, even I know Mexican Rice doesn't have peas and corn in it, and margarita tasted like it was poured from a can. This is not considered real Mexican restaurant in my eyes. Was definitely a waste of money!!

The only way to watch a movie, this is the best movie theater in Phoenix, little costly but worth it for watching a movie while seating in a reclining lazy-boy and a full bar and the food is pretty good..

Str8 up the worst Native I have ever been to, my fianc√© and I sat 4 10 mins before even being greeted and it was from the manager and she took drink order then we didn't see our actual waiter for another 15 mins. On top of all that the potato skins I ordered were the worst I have ever had as well. The wings were ok but the time it took to get them wasn't worth it at all. We live near this place so it really sucks that we will not b returning bc of the service and we love Native!
