This is one of my favorite sandwich shops.  I have a standing Friday lunch with a coworker and we come here 80% of the time.  I get the same thing every time.  Call me boring, but it is the perfect sandwich.  The Kali Mist is turkey topped with pepperjack cheese, bacon, avocado, diced jalapeños, and chipotle dressing on white bread.  I don't know where they get their bread for certain, but I think it is a magical land of crispy, chewy delightfulness.  They offer other toppings, but who needs vegetables?  Cheba recently added a bar with beer on tap and offer an all day HH on Fridays.  Delivery is available through a phone app, but it takes an hour to get your food.  While still delicious when delivered, it is much better eaten fresh in the restaurant itself.  The stoner theme is the best and they always have a movie on so you can watch as you eat (you won't want to talk once you start eating these sandwiches).

I LOVE Popeye's Chicken, it is the best fast food chicken joint there is IMHO.  This location is terrible.  They have forgotten my side twice now (I keep going back cause they're the closest) and when my BF was ordering dinner the other day, there were four people ahead of him complaining about missing items or wrong orders.  If they run out of an item they will either leave it out or substitute it without telling you (they were out of breasts and gave the person a thigh).  *Always* check your order before leaving the parking lot.  The food is good, just bad service.

We play Co-Ed softball at Chaparral Park.  Prior to the Scottsdale league we played in Mesa.  The fields we were used to were not the best, so when we got to Chaparral we were in Heaven.  During the winter the grass get brown, but in the spring and summer the outfield is a lush green blanket.  The dugouts are enclosed so when it sprinkles you don't have to get an umbrella to protect the scoreboard.  The biggest complaint about the league is that they combine B and C leagues if they don't get enough teams in both, so the match ups can be very uneven and can cause some tension.  The rest of the park is very pretty.  My girlfriends and I ride our bikes here on Saturday afternoons and there are always plenty of people out and about.  The bike paths are really spacious so there is room for everyone.

We went to Pizza Mart on Sunday for a late lunch.  It is a cute little pizza parlor, with plenty of old school arcade games in the backroom.  Our timing wasn't the best, even though we got there around 2, as the line was fairly long and there was one person manning the register and drink station.  It took 15 min of standing in line to order our food (you order at the register then sit down and wait for your number to be called).  Our order took longer than others, we think because we ordered the deep dish.  The menu is simple, with 4-5 different specialty pizzas listed.  They don't tell you what comes on them, so we were a little surprised to see the "Carnivore" was just meatball and triple pepperoni.  We were expecting all the meat toppings.  For future reference, that is the "Porker".  The pizza itself was pretty good, not the best I've had but certainly not the worst.  I think the best part of the meal were the $0.54 soft serve cones we had for dessert.  We will definitely eat here again, we'll just be sure to order the right pizza next time.

This is my go-to wing place, particularly in Sundays for football.  It is also convenient to Hohokam Field for after spring training.  Bike ride and beer.  The food is delicious, especially the buffalo chicken nachos.  If the table isn't getting this as an app, I get it for my meal.  My salsa-snob boyfriend questioned the salsa that came with it, but I don't use it (just extra sour cream).  The wing flavor menu is long and has something for everyone.  Honey hot and BBQ hot are my favs.  If you have a sweet tooth, the apple tart and baby bundt cake are drool worthy.  They have a decent selection of specialty drinks, so I like to try a new one every time we visit.  I have been happy with everyone I've tried so far.  For beer drinkers, there is a fairly long list of draft and bottle options.  Our waitress was really attentive and the manager made sure to check in on our table to see how the service was.  It was a Wednesday night, but not crowded, so we got a table in the bar right away.  Our drinks were never empty before we were asked if we wanted the next round.  This week we were there for trivia night.  I love trivia nights, but this one was a little different than what I am used to.  Rather than being a question with one answer, it was done Family Feud style where you gave an answer and your points were determined by the survey results the host had.  It was fun, but I prefer having one definitive answer.  Because there were a variety of answers we had to debate whose answer was better.  Bae did learn to listen to me more often than not by the end.

I was pleasantly surprised by this museum.  My sister and I took her kids and we all had a great time. The exhibits were quite diverse and had plenty of interactive areas. There is a really cute pan for gold area and plenty of fossilized skeletons. The coolest part is the flash flood display. It's a three story rock formation that simulates a flash flood. It was fun to line up at the railing to watch the show with the kids.   If you have I kids, I highly recommend taking them here.

I went here to catch a game with a friend.  There are lots of TVs and your typical dive bar patrons.  The waitress was a bit flighty.  I ordered a tuna sandwich (brave choice).  She came back to the table to ask what type of bread.  Then came back to ask if I wanted it toasted.  And finally came back to tell me they were out of tuna.  She took my friend's drink order, then came back 5 minutes later and asked if he wanted a drink.  On the brightside, it was fairly cheap.

I live very close to Main Street Billiards so I know how sketchy the area is.  I had intended to go here for pool a few years ago, but talked myself out of it because of the neighborhood (before I moved to it....).  So when my BF took me here to play, I was taken by surprise to see the interior is super clean and well lit.  It was league night (Thursday) and we just stopped in to talk to some folks.  There are plenty of tables to play on, so on non-Thursday I would imagine it is not hard to get a spot to play.  The drinks are cheap and there is food, though I did not try anything.  I know I will be going back, so stay tuned.  I will update the post after spending more quality time at Main Street.

My boyfriend took me to this market for salsa ingredients. I do not do well in really crowded areas. This place was crazy. He was in the zone picking veggies while I guarded to cart in the corner trying to remember to breathe. The selection is really nice, but the prices are hit and miss depending on season. It is one of those markets that are cheap, but be sure to inspect your produce carefully and plan to eat soon after purchase.

When I first moved back to Arizona from NYC I needed to make sure I could find good sushi.  I searched the reviews for a place to start.  I found it hard to believe that a strip mall sushi place could be as good as the reviews said.  But after the first time eating there I could see the hype.  My usual order is a Crunchy Roll (spicy tuna rolled in tempura flakes) and a Caterpillar.  They are consistently delicious and my favorite sushi place in the valley.  When we dine in we sit at the sushi bar and on the slower nights the chef will make us something to sample.  I used to have it timed out where I knew exactly where to call on my route home for pick up to be done just in time for me to arrive.  Sadly I move closer to Tempe, but I will still make the trek to eat here on occasion.  Totally worth the drive to East Mesa for some rolls.

We come to this Zipps almost every week after softball since we play down the street in the Scottsdale league.  We have a decent size group, but can always find a place to sit when we get there mid-evening.  We all like to get the 32oz premium drafts for $6.  Then we get a smattering of apps around the table.  The food is good, but I've only really had the appetizers (having never been here for an actual meal)  The nachos are great, they are not shy with the toppings.  The wings and onions rings are always good too.  There is a shuffleboard table and pool.  The wait staff are all super friendly and are good about checking in to see if we need anything.

Rula Bula is my favorite bar on Mill Avenue, but I'm a huge fan of all things Irish.  Did you know Rula Bula is gaelic for "rough and tumble"?  I sent a photo to my friend in Dublin and he informed me of the translation.  We always get the pickle back shots when we go.  If you've never experienced a pickle back, you need to.  It is a shot of Jameson chased with a shot of pickle juice.  It does not sounds good, but it is flippin amazing.  My friends who aren't huge whiskey fans love them as well as it will kill the afterburn in your throat.  I love the Guinness BBQ sauce (my Irish pal says that's blasphemy, but it's because he hasn't tried it), so try the burger with the BBQ sauce.  This bar is also good for getting the various Irish draughts like Harp (Northern Ireland) and Smithwicks (Republic of Ireland), not to mention the Guinness staple.  We like to hang on the patio, but dining in the restaurant is just as fun.    Sláinte!!!!

I was not impressed by this Dairy Queen.  I ordered a small Blizzard and my BF ordered a hamburger through the drive thru.  We were handed the Blizzard then told to pull forward as it would take time to make the burger.  When we asked how long, we were told 10 mins.  We questioned that amount of time, being a drive thru and all, and he then stated "that is just an estimate, it will probably be 5 minutes, but the car in front of you ordered food too".  By the time his food came, I was done with my ice cream.  The hamburger was not that great.  We are going to stick to ice cream only from Dairy Queen in the future.

I found Vatoci Hair Studio through my circle of friends.  Three years ago I moved back to AZ from NYC and needed a salon to get my do did.  So the girls took me to Spiro for my birthday  (we made a day of it).  I didn't know exactly what I wanted, just that i wanted it short and sassy.  I let Spiro have free reign on my hair and when he was done, I knew I was hooked.  He is an artist when it comes to styling.  I'm a little lazy when it comes to fixing my hair in the morning, so he showed me how to do as little as possible to my hair and still make it look good.  When I decided to color my hair I just walked in and said "I want to color it" and let him work his magic (he picked the colors and everything).  Again, he knew what I wanted better than I did.  If you're not quite as free with your hair, he's really good about listening to what you want and making sure you leave smiling.  Beyond his talent, he is a super nice guy who's good for a laugh or an uplifting thought, depending on your mood.  So if your tresses are in need of love, go see Spiro.  The shampoo session alone will have you coming back for more.

I haven't been to Del Taco in a while. I will not be returning to this location any time soon. I ordered a bacon breakfast burrito with no red sauce and hash brown sticks. My burrito had no bacon but it did have red sauce. What a disappointment. We all know bacon is the best part.

I love this theater!  My boyfriend brought me here to see Star Wars. The loungers are super comfy and the arm rest lifts up so you can sit close. Just be sure to get the right number seats so the movable armrest is between you. My only complaint is the seats are a little low so there is a railing in the very bottom of your viewing area. Being able to prebook your seat takes all the stress out of big opening weekends. You can show up just before it starts and be guaranteed the seat you want. I can't go back to the old crowded, first come first serve seating.

Such a disappointment. Bae and I took the kids to dinner at Red Robin on a Friday night. When we first arrived it was fairly busy, but we still got a table rather quickly. The first person to approach the table asked for our drink order. We requested a kids menu first. He copped an attitude and said "it's the same drinks as the regular menu". Note that the prices are different since some drinks are included with the cost of the kids meal. We think he was a manager because his polo was different from the rest of the staff. The crowd died down shortly after we got settled in. The meal itself didn't take that long to come but it took a good 15-20 min to get a refill on the drinks and longer to get more fries. The dipping sauces we ordered at the beginning of the meal barely made it out with the fry refill, which could have been dessert as late into the meal as we got them. Thankfully the tables have the machines to pay since we never saw anyone else after the first refill of fries. The dishes were dirty and the soda was watered down, the silverware and napkins were sparse. All in all we will not be returning to this restaurant.

I'm a big fan of Taco Bell and have been to most of the locations in my area.  This location is fairly close to my house so I come here more often than others.  The employees are all very nice and my order is always right (I always customize my food because I'm not a lettuce/tomato kind of girl).  I have not been inside, only through the drive thru, but they keep the line moving and it does not take long to pick up lunch.  My biggest complaint is the access.  It is on the northeast corner of the intersection with only one entrance that is north of the light.  The parking lot is fairly small and it is next to impossible to make a left out of there to go south (which I always seem to need to do).  I have to turn right and flip a u-y further down the road.  The lights are horribly timed so there are always cars coming from some direction.  It's a bit of a cluster.

I went to Mastodon to get an industrial piercing and a small tattoo.  I did not have an appointment, but they were able to take me in right away.  I got my piercing first since there was a tattoo in session.  Shane was super chill and did a great job placing the bar.  When I was done there, I got my tattoo with Laney.  Love her!  She is a great artist (her walls are covered in her previous work) and really nice.  I've gone back for another tattoo since with her and plan to go to her for others.  They're not open super late, so plan accordingly.

My coworker and I come here whenever we're feeling like something lighter for lunch.  My favorite things to order are the Deli Club or the California Club.  I get the half sandwich, half soup and pair it with the tortilla soup.  So tasty.  Plus, there are free gingerbread and corn muffins in the salad bar.  We are never disappointed when we eat here.  The tables are a little close for comfort (it takes a grace I lack to navigate between the chairs).  If you're looking for a good soup/salad/sandwich, you should eat here.  Just save room for the complimentary soft serve.

After a decent length stay in Vegas, bae and I stopped at Railroad Pass Casino for lunch. I got a club sandwich and bae got biscuits and gravy, pancakes, and eggs. It was all delicious!!  One of the best and cheapest meals of the trip. Our waitress was really nice and attentive. If you are not in a rush driving back to Phoenix, I would recommend grabbing a bite here before you head out. Not to mention the tables out in the casino all have low minimum bets so you can get a little more gambling in before you go.  The $3 poker had a few $800 wins while we were at the $5 black jack table.

Kabuki is among my top sushi places.  I like to go here with the girls for a ladies night, followed by shopping and a movie.  Of course I get my favorite, the spicy tuna.  We have start the meal with the Tokyo Quesadilla. This is an appetizer that consists of fried wonton skins, mozzarella cheese, and baja tomato salsa.  It is a perfect starter, but be sure to use the salsa.  We usually end up eating our first piece fast so we can beat the rest to a second helping.  Most importantly you must try the mint Sakerita.  We don't know what is it in per se, but it is cool and refreshing and perfect for a hot Arizona day.  Not that it needs to be hot out, as I like it anytime of the year.  If you're not into sake, the Tokyo Mule is a great alternative, the ginger beer is a good compliment to the sushi itself.  We rarely wait for a table, but the bar tends to be fairly packed.  They do not have TVs in the dining area, so if you're in the mood to catch the big game you need to sit in the bar.  Kabuki is one of the little gems that Tempe Marketplace has to offer and will ensure you start your shopping experience on the right note.

I love Ethel Ms. My mom and I used to come here for the tours when I was little. I haven't been in 12 years, but it was the same familiar self guided tour and free sample at the end. We went mid-week at 3p and I was a little disappointed that most of the machines were not running. The only one going was the enrober and it's on the other side of the production floor so it wasn't very easy to watch the chocolate coating action. The best part was the sample. Isn't it always? Since it was super slow we got an extra taste. Be sure to try the toffee. It's so good it makes you drool as you eat it. The chocolate is not cheap so I only bought my favorite for bae to try (vanilla satin cream) and an Irish whiskey truffle for myself.  We didn't go through the cactus garden, but living in Arizona it's nothing exciting for us. If you have a couple hours to burn and need to get away from the hubbub of the strip, come here and taste the best chocolate this side of the Atlantic.

7 Day Spa and Nails is conveniently located in Tempe Marketplace so you can get your nails did before shopping.  You do not need an appointment and I have never waited for a technician to seat me and start working.  The spa itself is very nicely decorated and relaxing.  I like to get a mani/pedi because it makes you feel super pampered.  I really wish they had a customer loyalty program to give incentives to those who get their nails done every month.

I like Clancy's.  We play Wednesday softball and like to drink after.  We went to Clancy's last night (not for the first time).  It was very quiet, we had zero issue getting a table and a very attentive waitress.  The music was some 90s throwback so we were pleased with the ambiance.  They have reverse happy hour so we got plenty to drink for low $.  Wednesday's at Clancy's are great because of the $5 burger.  They have a "4th of July cookout" flavor and are very filling.  I would recommend Clancy's if you're looking for a chill, laid back place to grab a drink in the area.  A quieter option to the louder Zipps next door.

My first time eating at Culinary was interesting.  We went for girl's night and had a table of 7.  At least three times I ordered something from the waitress that didn't come, and when I asked about my order she replied "oh, I wasn't sure you wanted it".  The food was okay, the table shared the pretzels and beer cheese, which tasted a bit like melted Kraft American cheese slices.  I ordered the grilled cheese sliders from the happy hour menu and they were adorable mini-sandwiches.  However (!) the menu said their grilled cheese came with bacon, but apparently the sliders don't.  So it was just bread and a butt-load of cheese, but still tasty.  I ordered the Gypsy Shandy and it was DELICIOUS.  The way it was described was rum and a splash of Mexican soda, but it tasted like lemonade, piña colada, and rainbows.  I had as many as I could fit in before HH ended, then switched to the brown bag special, which was a mystery selection can of beer in a brown bag for less than $2.  All in all it was a nice experience, but with all the selections to choose from in Old Town, I'm not sure this is the best.

Chilis is Chilis when it comes to the food selection and prices.  What I wanted to talk about was the service.  I order fajitas which is NBD, but Bae ordered a steak.  They asked him THREE times to cut his steak and check if it was cooked right.  For starters, you should have more faith that your chef knows what medium-rare is.  Secondly, let me cut my steak when I'm ready.  I think they did that so they didn't have to come back to our table for a while, because our server disappeared after he declined to cut the steak the third time.  Of course when he finally did, it was medium-well.  But, OMG, get the toffee brownie sundae.  We got ours to-go because we were stuffed, but it was amazing reheated.  I can only imagine how good it is in a warm skillet.

My Indiana-born boyfriend took me to Hoosier Cafe for breakfast the other day.  The walls are filled with Indiana school pennants, so I'm sure he likes this place in particular because of his roots.  However, the food was really good.  I ordered over-easy eggs, toast, bacon, and a pancake.  It was all cooked to perfection, the bacon was so crispy and delish.  I have a small appetite, but almost licked my plate clean.  He ordered the Spanish Omelet (chorizo, green chiles, onions, tomatoes and cheese) with biscuits and gravy instead of toast.  Yes, you can substitute toast for biscuits and gravy.  He liked his chorizo, though it wasn't quite what he was expecting for the flavor.  He couldn't quite place why, but he would still recommend it.  Our waitress was really nice and gave us plenty of attention, like refills on our drinks before we were completely finished.  The pricing was great; we left with very full bellies and it was less than $20, including a soda.  I would definitely recommend coming here for breakfast/brunch.

I went to Jester's with Bae and a good friend for some 9-ball practice.  There are a ton of tables and we were able to get one right away on a Saturday night in the non-smoking area (which is more than fine by me).  The biggest disappointment was the table types.  We play our league on a bar table, but at Jester's the bar tables are all pay-as-you-go $0.75 tables.  We wanted the hourly rates, so we were stuck at a large table.  Honestly, I had no idea the tables came in different sizes, since I started out on the bar tables in NYC.  There is a huge difference.  We started with a pitcher of Dos Equis, but it tasted a little flat, so we switched to bottles and mead.  Apparently, there's a local mead company that is just hitting the scene.  It was reasonably priced for being mead, but tasted like cider.  They have more flavors coming, including a prickly pear so I will definitely be keeping an eye on their menu.  There is no food, but they allow patrons to order from next door and they actually go get it for you.  No menus though...  We probably would have ordered a snack if we knew what they had.  Maybe you have to ask for them?

Bae and I stopped here for take out on our way home.  We decided to have a beer while we waited, so we bellied up to the cantina bar.  We ended up filling up on chips and salsa with our beers so we ate our meals later than expected.  Always on the hunt for great salsa, Matta's had a mild and a hot salsa that were perfect mixed.  The hot salsa lacks the chunks of the mild, which is what made the mix so good.  I cannot speak to the quality of the food since it had cooled down when we finally got hungry again, but was still good reheated.  We do plan to return for beers and apps at least.  A pint of Dos Equis was $5 and a house margarita was only $5.50.  These prices were outside of happy hour too.  There wasn't a huge crowd and the bartender was very attentive.  It was a nice experience and I am curious to try their food fresh.

My friends and I have been to Copper Blues several times, the location is ideal if you're doing anything downtown Phoenix.  I like the patio much more than I like the inside area.  During the day they're fairly comparable (depending on the weather) but inside gets way too loud once the band starts.  It's fine if you're there for the music, but if you want to have any kind of conversation you are out of luck.  They have a great selection of beer on tap, with even more in bottles.  The chicken nachos are off the hook.  When they came to the table we had to clear half of the space just to put them.  They taste as good as they look, so fortunately there is plenty to share.  My friends always get the soft pretzels and they are consistently delicious.  The mac and cheese is good, but the bacon is much better than the short rib.  We will definitely continue to come here when we make our treks downtown.

The Brush Bar is the best for girls night!! My friend had her birthday here and it was a blast. I also came for ladies night with another set of friends (they have snacks). The instructors break the paintings down to easy to repeat steps so no matter what your skill level you can be proud of your results. They play great music and have a wine bar so it makes for a fun, relaxing time. Taking your painting home is a great keepsake.  You are guaranteed a fun night with the girls here.

I have never been a fan of post offices.  This one had a long line in the middle of the morning.  If they had an electronic mail station it would be much simpler.  Instead you have to wait in a long line just to have an extremely rude employee assist you in the mailing process.  If you need me to sign the back of my credit card, explain that to me.  No need to be a dick about it.  No one signs the back of credit cards these days.  There are multiple locations in Mesa, go to another one.

I started going to Simplicity Laser due to a recommendation from a coworker.  I had bought a Groupon to see what it was all about, which I ended up using the value as credit towards a three-area treatment.  I get underarm, legs, and Brazilian, paid on a monthly schedule.  I have been getting treatments for over a year now and have been treated by all the technicians in the office.  There is not one technician or employee I don't like in this office.  Everyone is *extremely* nice and friendly.  I am greeted by name when I arrive and always feel welcome when I come in.  More recently I bought a facial special (3 for $99, what?!?).  The esthetician Elisa (Lisa) is so nice and knowledgable about what my skin needs.  After just my first facial my skin was visibly improved.  She recommended a cleanser they sell and it has done wonders for my skin!  I highly recommend using this location of Simplicity if you are in the market for hair removal or facial services.  You cannot go wrong.

If you need to mail something, I would highly recommend using this location.  They have a mailing kiosk where you can process your package yourself and not have to wait in line to speak to an employee.  I went at noon and walked right up to the machine.  I was in and out before I could complete my Yelp check-in.  The only issue with this location is the access.  It's in a neighborhood so you have pedestrians and slow changing lights to contend with.  I will definitely be returning to this location for all future USPS needs I have.

We went on a double date to Osaka. It was a blast. Our chef put on a great show and we got at least three shots of sake, bottle fed to us during cooking time. My girlfriend and I paid the $7 split plate fee and shared a filet/chicken combo. It was more than enough food. And super tasty. Bae got the lobster which he enjoyed. Each meal came with two shrimp as well.   The restaurant was on the noisy side, but half of the noise was the chefs cooking. And it seemed like every 15 min the "Happy Birthday" song came on and the restaurant burst into a loud celebration. By the end of the night we had it memorized and were trying to decide how many nights of working there would it take before the song drive you completely insane.

I always use the cell phone lot when I am picking people up from PHX.  There are always parking spots near the flight board and Terminal 4 is super close.  It's free to park and provides a place to chill until your party has landed.

When I was living in NYC I attended a nation wide food award event. The Fry Bread house won an award that night. When I moved back to Phoenix I decided to look them up and try the food. I had never had a savory fry bread before so I had nothing to compare it to in that sense, but it was delicious. I have had the fry bread covered in sugar and honey, and their version is excellent. I have only been to the old location which was limited seating, but I've heard they moved to accommodate their rising popularity.

I lived in NYC for four years and love the New York Style pizza, with huge floppy pieces.  Zio's is the closest I've found in the area to that style of pizza.  And they're open until 4am.  So it's great late-night, bars-are-now-closed food.  You can get delivery, but it takes an hour (even though I live 0.1 miles from their store).  I would recommend pick up.  The garlic knots are worth getting as well, they are greasy and doughy and delicious.  You can dine in, but the pizza ovens make it a little warmer than I like and there are only hard seats so it's not super comfortable.  Zio's is a great place to get pizzas for parties or late night drunk food.  Do it.

The Henry is beautiful.  I sat at the bar for mules and apps, but had a nice view of the open kitchen to watch the buzz.  Everything we ordered was incredible, though fairly small portions.  I would recommend saving The Henry for special occasions since it's a little pricey.  The decor is very modern with a clean feel, very inviting and relaxing.

I hadn't had my peepers checked in a while and was in need of new glasses and contacts.  I went through my insurance to find local places I could go.  Everyone was super nice and helpful.  It was a little slow.  I made an appointment, but still found myself waiting to see the doctor.  The doctor was thorough and helpful, he made sure I fully understood my eyes and how they are changing over time.  After I saw him I took a few minutes to choose frames.  The selection was not that great, but I found a couple options and finally a pair that worked for me.  The biggest issue I had was checking out.  The computer rebooted midway so I sat there longer than I should have.  When I got home I reviewed my itemized bill.  There was an warranty charge for the glasses I wasn't told was going to be on there and a copay that was much higher than I was told it would be.  Fortunately they reviewed the bill and refunded the money with no hassle.  I would definitely come back here, I will just be sure to check my bill before I leave.  The turn around time was top notch though!  I ordered my frames Monday at lunch and had them on my face Wednesday after work.

I was taken to Pink Pony for a first date.  First impressions from the outside is that it's a small, casual restaurant in Old Town Scottsdale.  In fact, I've been in the area a few times and never noticed it before.  Once inside, my impression changed immediately.  It is very clean and inviting.  The decor is very simple and modern.  We were seated at a booth for two, but it was not cramped.  My date chose the Pink Pony because of the mule menu; there are *seven* types to choose from.  He had never had one, so we each picked one to try and compare.  First round was the traditional Moscow Mule for him and the Tower of London for me.  They were both refreshing and well mixed.  The second round we tried the Bonnie & Clyde for him and the Oaxacan for myself.  The Oaxacan was my favorite, but I like all things prickly pear (blame the desert rat in me).  My date preferred the traditional mule, which is never a bad choice for your first time.  We each ordered steak, I got the NY Strip Steak (only because it was the cheapest red meat on the grill menu and I didn't want to run the tab up too much) and it was delicious.  It came with a salad, grilled brussel sprouts, and fingerling potatoes.  Cooked and seasoned perfectly.  It didn't *need* the sauce that came with, but it was a bacon demi so I had no choice but to use it.  My date ordered the ribeye that was on special and practically licked his plate clean.  The Pink Pony, like my date, really impressed me and will definitely get a second visit.  The reason for my 4 stars is the bathrooms.  The restroom handles were horseshoes welded together into "M" and "W",  super cute and fitting with the theme.  But the W was pink.  I get that it's the "Pink" Pony, so make both bathroom handles pink.  Not just ladies like the color these days.  I'm not an ultra-feminist, but that rubbed me the wrong way.

I stopped in here for a quick drink with a friend.  We were one of two groups in the entire place, they had three and we had two.  We were all seated at the bar where there were two bartenders.  My friend arrived before I did and had his beer by the time I joined him.  It took them 10 minutes before they even acknowledged that I was there.  I ordered a draft and an app.  The beer came fairly quick, but after 15 minutes I asked when I could expect my food only to find out he didn't put the order in.  I asked for the check, finished my beer, and went to get food elsewhere.  I will not be going back any time soon.

I am headed to Vegas tomorrow and desperately needed a mani-pedi before we left.  While Bae went for a hair cut, I went to Chase Nails.  The salon is tucked in a corner of a strip mall and looks like what you would expect from a nail place located as such (i.e. small, clean, quiet).  I went at noon on a Saturday and got a chair immediately. Since my piggies will be on display at the Go Pool in Vegas, I decided to splurge and get their most elaborate pedicure (only $40, so not bad).  John was great.  He took his time and made sure my legs looked "15 years younger" for my trip.  I got a mud mask, paraffin wax, and callous removal.  He also gave me a lotion massage and a hot stone massage.  It was awesome!!  After he was done, he handed me off to Donna to do my manicure.  She was very thorough with my cuticle clean, which is my favorite part.  After my gel was done in the UV, she gave me a forearm and hand massage.  I will definitely go back here the next time my nails need some TLC.

After wandering around Fremont street for a bit, we stopped here for a bite. Be sure to join the players club do you can get $2 off your meals. We arrived about an hour before it closed on St Patrick's Day and got a table right away. I ordered the brisket and bae got the 1/2 chicken and 1/2 rack of ribs. It was all really good, but the chicken won the meal. I think the butter was unsalted, which threw me off, but the two types of bbq sauce on the table were delicious (bae really liked the hot and spicy). If you are on Fremont and feeling hungry, come in here. The price a right and the beers are only $5 for the big glass.

I went with some friends to hike this trail the other morning.  It was a beautiful day in early January, you have got to love living in Arizona.  The full trail is about 7.5 miles in one pass.  It's nice that the trail is a full circle so you don't have to backtrack.  It took us about 3.5 hours to complete the full thing.  In the first mile we made good time because it was a gradual incline, but we slowed mid-way where it starts to get rocky and you have to watch your footing so you don't slip.  I say that but there were people there running on the trail.  I'll walk.  Thanks.  We stopped midway for a snack in the shade.  It's nice being so close to Mesa yet you can find such a quiet isolated desert vista.  The one thing I would highly recommend is going left when you enter the trail.  This allows for a nice incline and a sharper decline vs having to navigate up some rocky areas.

For a great old fashioned diner style meal, check this place out. I got a classic club and it was tasty!!  The turkey was clearly carved from the breast and the ham was thick cut. Bae got the nachos and they weren't quite what we expected. The chips are thick and house-made. The benefit to that is they hold up longer against cheese-sog. Once he got used to the texture of the thicker cut chips, he cleaned his plate. The waitress was very friendly and the food was prompt. They kept offering to get him something in place of the nachos since he was hesitant about the chips.  For those who live close we heard them getting set up on GrubHub so you're in luck for delivery soon!

Even though Chipotle has had some recent struggles, I have not lost faith in them.  Did take full advantage of the free burrito coupon offered the day they closed their stores for the company-wide health training.  This was the first time I have been to the new location for this Dobson store.  The new building is very clean and inviting, and they have plenty of seating now.  The line was long, which is normal for any Chipotle at lunch time, but the employees were very efficient and it was my turn before I knew it.  The folks behind the counter were very friendly and made sure I had everything I needed.  The cashier kept listing things I could get, even offering me a water cup when I declined a drink.  My only issue was the barbacoa was in huge chunks which made the bowl hard to eat without a knife.

We went to Fat Cats for a movie this Saturday. I love the leg room and reclining seats, but the concession stand is on the outside of the ticket taker so you have to leave the movie area and show your ticket to get back in. They call it recline and dine, but you can't bring alcohol past the ticket booth and the recliners aren't really suited to "dining". We will definitely go back since the ticket prices are cheaper than Harkins where you feel like you're in the 3rd class deck of the Titanic.   Biggest complaint? The armrests are all stationary so you can't sit close to Bae. If you want a good date place, try Cinemark at Mesa Riverview.

I have been wanting to do an escape room experience for a while.  My friends and I found a Groupon for Phoenix Puzzle Room.  I was able to get five friends to join me, since you need a group to play.  The room we played was "The Curse of Madame Lumina" with a fortune teller theme.  You have an hour to solve a series of puzzles to find keys and clues to the next puzzle.  We managed to solve the room with 1 minute and 19 seconds to spare.  It was harder than I expected, but had a blast nonetheless.  The room is monitored the whole time by a gamekeeper who provides the three allotted clues (as long as we all had our hands raised in agreeance) and was really good about keeping the game moving along.  Make sure to have a good game plan when you first start, we wasted some time at the beginning trying to find a starting point.  I was very excited to play at the Phoenix Puzzle Room and they did not disappoint!  Looking forward to going back to try the other room.  I would definitely recommend at least four people, we had six and we all participated to find the answers.  They mentioned adding smaller rooms for couples, which would make for a great date night!!

IMHO Casa Reynoso is the best Mexican food in the valley.  A good friend of mine is from Miami, AZ, which is where the Reynoso family originated as well, so we have been eating Casa for quite some time now.  I took my boyfriend there for his first time this week.  We started with a plain cheese crisp (you can't go wrong with ordering one of these) but we also tried the JoAnne Special, which is a corn crisp tortilla topped with green chili pork, jalapeno and cheese melted in oven.  It was AMAZING.  It's on the small side, so you may want to order one for each person.  But SO good.  I got my normal red mixed chimichanga which was just as good as always.  The bae got a red mixed burro and a green mixed burro.  However, his favorite part about the meal was the salsa (and he's a salsa snob), he preferred the regular to the hot.  The prices at Casa are super cheap for what you get ($4-5/burro).  The burros reheat really well, so I recommend getting some to go.  The Xaviers Casa Reynoso is a new location (they just relocated from a tiny to-go storefront), it is nice and clean, with plenty of room to dine comfortably.  The waitstaff are very attentive and the food comes to the table fairly quickly.  We will be dining at Casa for many years to come.

A Girlfriend's Review: bae and I saw X Country while we were in Vegas. We paid a little extra for closer seating, it was a really small space and was first come first serve. We showed up 15 min before the house opened and managed to get a decent spot in line, which was really long by the time the doors opened. We got the second row, I guess the only way to get the first row is to tip the person showing you to your seat. Anyway, on to the show. It was fantastic!!  Being the theatre nerd I am, I really enjoyed the show itself. The music was great and the costumes were cute.  I got to enjoy a good production and bae got to see some cute girls with their tops off. Good times for all. I would definitely recommend this for date night, we got our tickets at Tix4Tonight and saved a little mula.

I don't even know where to start with this review. I have been here on multiple occasions, because this is Bae's family's favorite restaurant. On one of the occasions I ordered chicken fried steak with brown gravy. Call me weird but I like my brown gravy. They brought me chicken fried chicken with brown gravy, when I asked to have it corrected they brought me chicken fried steak with white gravy. Tonight we took the oldest for her 15th birthday. We made it a point to say "birthday girl" in front of the waiter several times but he failed to even say Happy Birthday let alone do the whole birthday dessert deal. The youngest had the kids meal, which comes with a drink. She ordered the special lemonade with no refills. We were charged the full price and she was never offered the drink that came with the meal. When we pointed that out, our waiter said "well, I brought her a water". To top it all off, I ordered a $5.25 drink off the back of the cocktail menu. The receipt came out $7.50 because "that's the happy hour menu" which nowhere even indicated it's happy hour.  He was really attentive, but his flippant reaction to our questions on the unexpectedly overpriced bill was disappointing. As we were trying to leave he hovered a foot a way so he could grab the bill, which is such a major faux pas and rude.

My friends and I attended CrushBrew and had a very nice evening.  It wasn't super crowded, I'm sure due to the hefty ticket price.  The 15 drink tickets lasted a decent amount of time, but some of the vendors were more generous than others.  I avoided the wine booths because most of them used the measuring pour spouts so there was little room for getting a bonus amount.  The beer vendors were the best for getting a decent sized sample of their beverage.  The layout wasn't the best, it was one row of vendors along the river, so you would pass the same booths in both directions.  This is good if you want to get another taste of something you'd already had, but not that great if you're trying to get all unique tastings.  The weather was amazing and it was really nice to be outside after sunset.  We all had fun in the free photobooth and found tons of swag.  My biggest hangup was the price.  I don't know that I would pay full price for what was there and what came with the cost of the ticket.  I've done plenty of these types of festivals and this was the first that came with a plastic collectible cup.  I don't mind the plastic for by the pool, but you know their cost was not as high glass.  Parking was a bit of a hassle, but we managed to find as spot in the underground lot by Olive and Ivy (we arrived around 5).
