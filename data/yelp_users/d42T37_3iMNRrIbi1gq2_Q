When I found out we were going here for brunch while I was in town, I was excited.  I had not had beignets since I was in Nola in April and I was craving them.  When we arrived at 10 to 11 (brunch begins at 11), there was already a line of people waiting outside.  The doors opened and people walked in like they had not ate in years, we knew we were in for a treat.  The restaurant is within what appears to be a house.  The dining rooms are where a living room and a den would typically be.  We were seated by the fireplace, which was running since it was 45 degrees outside.  The decor is very quaint and welcoming, almost like you're visiting a relative's house.  The dinner menu is also available all day but you truly go to this place for brunch.  I originally asked for a coffee with amaretto but they don't serve alcohol before noon (I'm spoiled from NY brunches) but their regular coffee was just as good.  We started off with an order of beignets.  6 perfectly sized fried balls of dough were presented with the most delicious strawberry compote in the middle for dipping.  The beignets were perfect and light and that compote made my day.    For our entrees, we each got something different and decided to pick and choose from the other plates.  I got the bacon, egg, and cheese omelet.  This omelet was thick with a whole layer of bacon going through the center.  It also came with a side of cheesy grits, which were also delicious, and fresh fruit.  My friend got the bananas foster French toast.  The bananas were sweet but good and the toast itself was fluffy and delicious.  My other friend got the rice and beans, which yes becomes an entire meal since sausage is also included.  These were some of the best rice and beans the three of us have ever tasted.  And this is coming from a Puerto Rican, who also confirmed their tastiness.  Overall, this is a fantastic place for brunch.  Get there early, and try a little bit of everything.

I've only been here for connections to other flights but I adore this airport.  It's one of the most organized airports I have ever been to.  There's a bunch of places to eat and shop while you're waiting for your connection.  I've also heard that recently they added free wi-fi and you can't beat that if you have your laptop with you and you're stuck in an airport for a few hours.

I recently returned to this airport since I finally had a reason to travel to Charlotte again!  While I'm keeping it at 4 stars, let me list the ways it is an awesome (and convenient airport): 1) It's clean 2) The main terminal is home to all of the main airlines and therefore if you're flying out with someone else, you can still hang out together prior to their flight departing 3) They have TSA pre-check and also randomly select people (like yours truly) to try it out.  No need to remove your shoes or 3 ounce liquids! 4) Plenty of charging stations 5) A few small eateries so you can at least get something quick before your flight

This place is HUGE.  I was here for Wrestlemania Fan Axxess and it was on the bottom level, which requires you going down 2 separate escalators just to get to.  The entire complex is shiny and huge and amazing.  Of course, it's $3 for a bottle of water but they know they're gonna get you when once you're in, you can't leave again, and you know you're gonna be thirsty after walking around for 4 hours or so.

Minus the fact that there's no dresser and the area itself is kind of shady, this hotel is still pretty nice.  The rooms are huge.  There's a separate area with a desk and a countertop with a microwave, then there's another area with a couch and TV as well as the couch being a pull-out, and finally there's the bedroom area with the bathroom off to the side.  There's not much walking room so it's not VERY spacious, but you can make due with what you're given.  There's also complimentary breakfast every morning, a shuttle for the airport, and a little market place if you want soda or a quick snack in the middle of the night.

This airport is a joke.  So there's one level for both departures and arrivals?  I can only imagine how cluttered this place becomes during peak-hours.  Once you're inside, you realize arrivals go upstairs and each terminal has their security checkpoint.  Why is this so complicated?  And the North Curb and South Curb?  Why?  The whole place, inside and out, appears to be very cluttered.  Maybe I'm just spoiled by spending many years at JFK and LGA.

Spacious stadium with a dome.  Okay, that about sums it up.  I mean, how do you REALLY review a stadium?  I was here for Wrestlemania, not a game, so it was a slightly different atmosphere.

I would like to give this service 0 stars but unfortunately Yelp does not allow such things.  So 1 star it is!  The monorail almost got me a bench warrant in the city of Phoenix. How?  Okay I'm from New York, we have TURNSTILES, you swipe your Metrocard THEN you enter.  This system has nothing!  Wait...It has 1 machine in the only area where you can choose to tap your card if you want to.  Otherwise, you board without a card and risk the Phoenix police issuing you a ticket in court the following week.  I was here on vacation, luckily no ticket for me or I would have been an outlaw in this city.  Ugh!!

I really wanted this bar to be fun.  I really wanted it to prove all the other reviews wrong.  Unfortunately, it's just as bad as others have said it is.  My friend's after-wedding-party was held here.  The friend I had traveled with and I made our way over and were shocked by the line to get in.  We figured the line was simply to check ID, however, it was also to check our purses and get wristbands.  Also, it's a $5 cover charge for men!  1) why is there a cover charge for a place this size? 2) why did security say they check bags for bottles of Jameson?  We got our wristbands and headed inside.  This place is massive.  In the center is the bar which is shaped like a guitar.  To the right is more of a dining area.  To the left is a huge stage with live performers, a dance area, and a couple of private areas for parties.  We found our friend's party in one of the private areas and headed in.  It was nice since it gave full view of the stage but country isn't really my thing so I just bopped my head along to the beat and watched in amazement as couples took over the dancefloor.  We were told to go to the bar to get our drinks and tell them which tab it was under.  My friend and I found an open spot at the bar and were told they don't "take drink orders there and to move to the middle".  Um....Okay.  So we did that, the bartender got my beer wrong, then said, "we don't keep tabs at the bar" but he was "nice enough" to tell our server.  Fine.  Later on, we saw our server coming to the party area to take drink orders.  Overall, this place could be a million times better if they lightened up on security just a bit, got rid of the cover charge for men, and got better bartenders.  The servers were all very nice and like I said, the space is massive.  It has potential.

It was late, we had already been on the road nearly 4 hours coming back from the Grand Canyon, we were in need of a burger and fries.  As two chicks from the Northeast, we knew we had to get THE burger and fries.  Mcdonald's would just not do.  We decided to Yelp In N Out, and there it was, half a mile off the exit.  This location is laid out like any other In N Out location.  The basic menu was a glimmer of hope after a long and exhausting day.  The girl working the register was very nice and it turned out to be her first day.  I ordered a cheeseburger with animal-style fries, while my friend went with a double-double and regular fries.  The orders were a bit slow coming out but this is a place that makes everything fresh and I seemed to have forgotten that.  The food was good, as always.  It's hard to screw up the food here.  The service was friendly and the staff was singing along to songs playing on the radio (it was a quiet night, I can't fault them for that).  This definitely hit the spot.

I've never experienced a "bad" Double Tree so I'm not surprised that this location was just as nice as others I have visited.  This location is perfect if you're staying in the Gilbert/Mesa area.  It's about 40 minutes from the airport which isn't terrible considering how large the Phoenix-area is.  There is an impressive fitness room, a small pool that is perfect for a hot day, a spa (didn't get to check that out), and a solid restaurant with an $11 breakfast buffet every day!  Their room service is also pretty good and not at all expensive.  There is also a pantry downstairs (just like all Hilton locations have) with a vending machine (takes plastic) as well as snacks and other items you may need during your stay.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.    The rooms are HUGE and have massive ceilings.  The only issue is while the room itself is large, the bathroom is small and narrow.  The bathroom door opens right into the toilet.  Water pressure and temperature is perfect.  The rooms (especially the bathroom) are much too dark but you'll make due.  There is also a tv with a lot of cable channels but who makes use of that?  Overall, this is a great Double Tree location.

My friend and I recently came here for another friend's wedding.  Let me start off by saying this place is absolutely beautiful.  You will totally drive right by it if you're not actively looking but that kind of adds to its charm.  There are technically two buildings, one that serves as a setup area (bridal suite if you're getting married, kitchen for food, etc. etc.) and the barn itself.  In-between is a courtyard type area where our friend had the ceremony.  Everything was wonderfully decorated and very rustic looking.  The barn housed the reception and we had a great time!  There was plenty of room to dance and the barn doors were a nice touch when it came to introducing both the bridal party and the newlyweds!  The barn is pretty much open to however you want it to look.  Our friend was very DIY with the wedding process so it went well with the rustic feel of the barn.  There are also beautiful chandeliers that hang, as well as dimmer switches to change the ambiance.  The only issue I had is that the cleanup is on you.  Maybe there's another package available where they have a staff that takes care of it, but that didn't seem to be the case.  Once the event ends, you're given an end time to be cleaned up and out of there by.  The only staff I saw were parking attendants that helped with parking across the street, as well as helping bring the chairs from the ceremony outside to the reception inside.    This is truly a wonderful spot to celebrate a momentous occasion, especially if you're like me and prefer something "different" from the usual over the top wedding (think your typical NY wedding).
