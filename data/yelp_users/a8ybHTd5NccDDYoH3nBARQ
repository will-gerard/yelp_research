Food is AMAZING! best experience I have had in any restaurant! service is outstanding and having a gluten allergy was no problem for the chef! A upscale, pricey restaurant that is definitely worth the drive! Will recommend to anyone!

I am currently on a 12 Week Candida Cleanse and have already lost 15 lbs in the first 4 weeks! Dr. Infantino has been so helpful and is very knowledgable about any questions I have while on the cleanse. I have been on many diet and detox programs in the past and gave up because I did not see any results. Since starting the cleanse at Platinum Wellness I have lost weight, gained an increase in my energy levels and can't wait to see my results at the end of 12 weeks! Dr. Infantino and his staff go above and beyond to keep you motivated and enjoy the program!

went for a manicure as a walk-in. no one was in the place except the employees. kinda strange. did not like the atmosphere thought it was cheap and tacky.  nails were cut uneven, cut my cuticles really bad, nail polish all over my fingers and she smudged three nails. worst manicure and nail salon i have been to in a long time! will Never go back and will never recommend to people!  prefers cash instead of credit, who carries cash now of days??? its ridiculously expensive for the whack job that was done on my hands....  word of advice stay away and go elsewhere!!
