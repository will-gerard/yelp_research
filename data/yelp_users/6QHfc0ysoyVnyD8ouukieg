I LOVE this shop! I was referred by a good family friend after my artist moved up to Seattle. I checked out a few other shops in Scottsdale and Tempe, where the artists were stuck-up and waaay overpriced (I got quoted $900 for a 4 by 2 inch black tatoo, for reals?!). Anyway, I found my way up to Wisemagic and fell in love with Tanner. His work is phenomenal, and better yet, he understood what I wanted. I've been going there for a few years now and have referred all of my friends. Everyone loves the shop, the artists and their tattoos! If you're looking for some talented artists, reasonable prices and you're sick of the stupid tattoo culture of Scottsdale and Tempe, get your butt up to Wisemagic!

I have been going to Jesse Collman at Steven Paul Salon for years now and she is by and far my favorite stylist. Her technique with color is phenomenal! My friends and family all get their hair done with her and we all love her! She listens to her customers, but is also honest about things like upkeep with certain styles. She takes the time to show you how to do your hair every time you get a new cut, so that your hair looks its best all the time. She is friendly, polite and sweet as can be! If you're in the market for a new stylist, Jesse is the one!

This is by and far my favorite Indian restaurant in the Phoenix metropolitan area! They have the most delicious palak paneer and I love their peas paratha! I have never had a bad experience here and routinely order their food for take-out. The staff is polite and attentive and the prices are reasonable.

I will never go back to this store! The associates smother you, which is infuriating and rude after the 10th interruption in 20 minutes. The last time I went in to browse, I tried on a few items and was harrassed into buying a $60 "skincare system" which I really didn't want or need. So tonight I went back to exchange the skin goodies for some shirts. When I came back from the register, the gal insisted that I give her my phone number and address before she could go through with the exchange (I never give out my number). She and the manager refused to exchange my items until my girlfriend finally gave them hers. WTF? No work-around? I was seriously ticked off, because a simple exchange took over 20 minutes. After two horrific experiences, I'll forgo the overpriced clothes and instead go to Old Navy or Babies R Us' maternity departments (or order online). Not. Worth. It.

Yum-O! I've already been twice and I'm hooked! The Burger Brulee was so-dang-good (you can't beat a burger with a fried egg on top!) and the Shrimp Club sandwich was super yummy. I like that they're not afraid to try flavor combinations and they are very modestly priced. My friends had the Country Fried Burger, the Sloppy Joe and the Burger Parm. I had a few bites of each and they were all flavorful and a delight to put in my mouth! I highly recommend the Burger Brulee for those who have not been yet, because it will BLOW YOUR MIND!
