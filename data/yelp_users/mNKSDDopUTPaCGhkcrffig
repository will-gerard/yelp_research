First of all, I just want to start off by saying that I spray tan often (usually custom airbrush, but I have also used automated machines) and have been spray tanned by several people/businesses. I usually don't write bad reviews, but I genuinely cannot think of anything positive to say about Maximum Airbrush Tan. I'm actually baffled reading the other reviews and can only conclude they are friends of Mandy or girls who work in the office with her. Unfortunately, I bought a package of two through Groupon so I went twice. My first experience wasn't good. Groupon made it sound like this was a salon, when it is actually just a single person who uses a very small office at a plastic surgeons office. No one will answer the phone, you have to leave a message and Mandy will text you to schedule an appointment. Very informal and not personable at all. I also called 10 days in advance of the day I needed an appt, she did not have any available appointments for three weeks. I explained over text that I was desperate since I was going to the beach 34 weeks pregnant and very flexible if she could fit me in at ANY time (for a large tip), I had no idea I had to schedule my spray tan a month in advance. She was very short with me and simply said "No" so I ended up going somewhere else. Anyways, when I did get in, Mandy is about as friendly as a piece of cardboard. She stays in the room with you as you undress which I thought was odd. The room is tiny and there's a very small spray tan tent that she uses, your elbows will hit the sides when doing the different poses and get covered in residue (which is also all over the floor too). My spray tan the next day after I rinsed (no soaps or shampoos) was non-existent. I was still whiter than a ghost, which you usually experience the opposite with a spray tan. It was like I didn't even get sprayed. Unfortunately, I still had one more tan and thought I would give it another shot. And even though she schedules over text, she managed to give my appt away to someone else. So not only was she 30 minutes late, but she was not apologetic. I told her that last time was way too light. The tan was very uneven, streaky, and it looked like she didn't even spray one of my knees. Bottom line, don't waste your money.

Abbey did an amazing job on my spray tan! It looks a little dark at first, but after that first shower, it's perfect. And it even lasted 10+ days. I will definitely be going back to see her for my next spray tan.
