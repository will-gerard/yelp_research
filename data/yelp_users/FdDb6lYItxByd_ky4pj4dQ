Whether it's breakfast lunch or dinner, this is the best place to eat in Gilbert. Hands down.

Order delivery today from Thai Elephant without had every trying it and was thoroughly impressed! Very delicious. Just got the Panang with chicken & sweet and sour chicken, both unbelievably good. My cousin is from Thailand and makes obviously the best Thai food, so normally I'm disappointed when I get Thai in the states from different restaurants, but not this place! Honestly, they have high quality, authentic Thai food, made exactly how it should be. I will definitely be ordering again soon.

Ordered chicken pho for takeout and it was soooo good!! Very impressed. Most pho doesn't tastes the same when it's takeout because you have to put it together yourself lol but this place makes it perfect! Very impressed. Good prices too. Ordered egg rolls and they were kinda good, not bad. Asked for siracha to go and they gave it to me no questioned asked. Will definitely be back soon!

Best Cigar Bar in town! I'm a frequent visitor of Fox's and refuse to go to any other cigar bar. The staff is super friendly and attentive. They always have the best craft beers and they know how to make the best mixed drinks!

Best breakfast, hands down. I've never been disappointed by the quality of their food, it's always good. This place is very popular on the weekends so prepare to wait in line for a long time, but know that it's totally worth it. Farmers Market Benedict never disappoints.

Update on my previous review:  So disappointed!! They must have changed their cooks of something because I come here all the time (at least once a week) and the past two times I've been here it's been awful...  My farmers Benedict was missing avocado and had un-ripe green tomatoes on it!! Ew. Next, I came for lunch today... And it was bad. The Roma chicken sandwich was SOGGY! The bread was so filled with liquid by the time it hit my plate that it fell apart in my hands, landed/splashed on my plate, and got on my shirt... Very disappointed.  What happened Ncounter? You use to be so reliable and delicious :(

This place use to be so good and have great service when it first opened, now it's just bad. The past 3 times I've come here, the service has been absolutely awful! And the quality of rolls they deliver aren't as good as they use to be. Honestly, the ONLY good thing about this place is their happy hour prices. That's it. You get what you pay for.

Pretty good fish tacos! Didn't like the shrimp taco tho. Chips & guac were delicious. Will come back to try breakfast burritos.

I try and try to like this place... And I can't. Tonight was the end of trying. A 45 min wait for a table turned into 2 hours so we just left. What's even worst is the hostess ignored my friend when he went up there for the third time to check on our table. Literally acted as if he wasn't standing there. The food sucks, service sucks... Can only be a happy alcoholic if you love craft beer because guess what? No full bar. Bye bye Wilderness.

Glad I came here with a Groupon because I was not impressed. Definitely not a place to pay full price at. Small portions, big price, mediocre food. Enough said.  Oh, also, worlds slowest service. I don't recommend this place.

THE WORST PLACE EVER. BEWARE!! This place is a scam!! The girl that works the front is a LIAR and her 'boss' and 'tech' are full of it too... Worst experience ever!!! Said they would fix my PS3 and replace the laser in 24 hrs... THREE WEEKS later I get it back and spend $75 and it's still broken... Brought it back and they admitted to me it was a broken laser and they NEVER replaced it and denied to me that they said they would fix it... What a joke. On top of it all, they wanna "cut me a deal" on a new laser for $45!!!! Lol! DO NOT GO HERE.. Highway robbery and a bunch of idiots. Reporting them to the BBB.

This place is a waste of space. I've been here twice now and I'm officially not ever going back. This mornings experience pushed me over the edge.  I ordered an egg sandwich, blueberry muffin, and iced triple latte through the drive thru. I get to the window, she hands me my food and a HOT latte... Not a big deal, I tell her I ordered iced and she goes back to fix it. 5 minutes later she comes back and I notice it has foam on the top... She goes "oh that's just the foam from the milk when it was hot" hahaha I look at her and I say "did you seriously just pour a hot latte over ice and try to give it to me?!" She rolls her eyes, goes back and tells me "okay we will remake it" Are you kidding me?? How lazy can you be?? Not only that, when you heat milk up to 160 degrees and then pour it over ice, you're now risking bacteria being formed... Unbelievable. $4.50 for that experience and a gross subpar latte?! No thanks.   Then I get home to eat my food (I live ONE street down btw) and it's soggy, gross, and falling apart. And the blueberry muffin is the WORST muffin I've had in my life.. It tastes like straight grease. NEVER going back here. I'd rather eat Starbucks breakfast and lunch for less money... How sad is that?  Don't waste your time & money.

So happy we went here for lunch. I'm not a burger fan, but I am a Fox restaurant fan, so I may be a little biased... But this was the best burger I've ever had! I just had the zinburger and it was delicious. We also had the truffle fries and they were to DIE for... So amazing. For a drink, I ordered the raspberry acai margarita and it was so flavorful and mouthwatering.. Oh my goodness. I definitely recommend this place! Service was great too!
