Awesome!!!  Loved everything about this place. I had the Cottage Pie and my friend had the Cheese Steak and both were excellent. Little confusing to find and looks closed from outside but worth the confusion!!!

Yummo!   I'm in my happy place right now. This chicken is done right!!!  And granny better watch out cause these waffles put hers out of the running.  Great place. A lot of food for the price.  Would like some gravy to dip my strips in. Keep up the great work my new chicken friends. Almost forgot. The fried okra and mac and cheese are amazing!!!  :-)

Second visit to Matt's. Thought I would give it one more try. The food is ok. I might even say good, but service is always my issue. I don't care how cute you are or how well your make-up is done. If you are my server, all I ask for is attentive good service. You are a breakfast place. Toast should be hot and out with food. Butter my toast or bring some butter out when you serve me. And, if I have to remind you to bring me toast or ask for butter, please graciously do so. Seems pretty basic to me. Maybe Chelsi is overworked or tired today. Maybe she is just having a bad day. I hope her day gets better and she feels more like getting back to business. Probably won't be back. Definitely not worth the wait. PS...  My bill was wrong too.

The food is consistent with all other chipo's but the A/C is either not working or needs to be turned down!  It is always hot as @$&/ in there. Every time I ask the staff why and they have no explanation.  When I asked if other people have complained the said all the time.  It's Arizona...  Every restaurant should have a working hvac in AZ!!!
