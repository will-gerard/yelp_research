Real hit and miss here I've had good meals and I've also gotten sick off their food. Twice! The bar is usually crowded with riff raff and the staff has been not helpful on many occasions. Don't waste your time

Best Panang in Arizona and they have huge plates both dine in and take out. Great deal and some of the best Thai food I've had

These people have no clue how to run a decent bar. Not a chill spot with terrible music and somehow people still show up. Garbage service and weak drinks
