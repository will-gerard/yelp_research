This location has the best merchandise out of any BE I've been to so far.  Of course they're not going to take your Wet Seal shirt from 2 years ago, deal with it.  When you look at their selection, you know why they're so picky.  And yes, some things could be a bit cheaper, but when you find the smokin' hot deals on the designer brands it's all worth it.  (I got a pair of True Religions for $45)

This place really makes me miss living in Phoenix.  Sure, it's not your average upscale Biltmore place, and the atmosphere is definitely relaxed and dive-y, but if that's what you like then the 'Dillo is great.  Drinks are way cheap, bartenders are very friendly and remember you, cheap pool, and I'm sorry, but I absolutely love their fried pickles (they're only $3 after 11!).  What more could a girl ask for?

Oh, Hidden House.  You and I go way back.  It started when all my coworkers and I would come visit you for happy hour after working night shift, mostly because you were the only bar open at 7 am.  But then I couldn't stay away and started coming during normal bar hours (aka at night).  I developed a love-hate relationship with your bathrooms.  I caught a guy stealing all of the quarters out of the pool tables; he felt bad and returned them.  I ordered pitcher after pitcher of cheap Bud Light.  After all we've been through, you haven't changed a bit, and I don't want you to.

My feelings for old town Scottsdale are lukewarm at best, but the Coach House makes me want to venture east more often.    I went for the first time recently, and I'm glad I did at this time of year.  It looks like Christmas threw up on the place, and I mean that in the very best way possible.  The patrons and staff are laid back, and the patio is roomy.  It was definitely packed, but not with the hair-gelled douches I usually associate with this area.  Win!

No.  Just.... no.  I should have just turned around when I arrived and there was already a police cruiser parked outside.  At 10 pm.  One side is country-karaoke, the other is a hip-hop room, and it all sucks.  I would have given it two stars for the sheer entertainment factor but the bathroom was covered in vomit.  Plus, I'm pretty sure some chick was snorting something in the stall next to me.

Southwest just kicks ass.  They always have amazingly cheap flight specials, are on time, and their crew rocks.  Any airline that will let their flight attendants sing the destination over the loudspeaker is ok with me.  Plus, they're not subscribing to this ridiculous fee-for-bags thing that everyone else is doing.  I can't really ask for much more in an airline.

Seriously overpriced, mediocre food.  If I'm paying $28 for a scallop dish, I don't expect 4 scallops plopped onto a plate and sides that I have to order separately.  Why not a composed, complete dish?  The truffle mac and cheese is good, but it's lazy to make the customer pick and choose.  The steaks are well seasoned and tender, but almost $40 and that was it... just the steak.  In the middle of a white plate.  Not even a garnish.  WHERE'S THE PARSLEY, PEOPLE?  I do love the servers and the service but that alone isn't worth dropping this kind of cash on this food.

Being a newly christened vegan, my dining out choices are slightly limited to say the least.  So when I heard about True Food, I got all kinds of ferklumped, especially when a few coworkers told me about how delicious it was.  I bet they had the stuff with meat.  I don't think restaurants understand how important service is to the entire experience.  I can have an amazing meal with the best food I've ever had, but if it takes 20 minutes for a server to come and just take my drink order, it's going to affect how much I enjoy said food.  I am not one to nitpick since I used to be a server myself, and I know how hard it is, but 20 minutes is nothing short of ridiculous.  With that being said, I was expecting the food to make up for the service.  Not so.  I ordered the quinoa salad, which was actually pretty good, although the dressing had waaay too much acid.  The beets were delicious.  My entree, the roasted vegetables with farro and figs, sucked.  75% of the vegetables were so undercooked they crunched when I bit into them.  Not cool.  The farro and figs were decent, but were so overwhelmed by the poorly prepared vegetables that I couldn't enjoy them.  My advice to them?  Don't put a vegan entree on the menu unless it's going to stand up against the rest of the list.  I'd rather eat my usual gathering of appetizers and sides.

This store is stocked to the hilt with all the beauty goodies you desire (except Bain de Soleil tanning lotion- that stuff is so hard to find!  Why is that?!), but their salon is bitchin' as well.  When you sign up for an Ulta card, you get 20% any salon service.  Stella gave me an amazing swingy haircut with awesome bangs.  Will definitely go back to see her!  My roommate gets her eyebrows waxed here and says the experience is very relaxing with a little facial massage thrown in.

Three words:  Bloody.  Mary.  Bar. Feeling a bit hungover on Saturday morning and itching for the hair of the dog, my friends and I head over to FuNuGyz on the recommendation of my buddy Ian (who always has good taste).  Build your own bloody mary for just $2 with well vodka, $3 with Skyy?  Heck yes.  They have every hot sauce, seasoning, condiment, and veggie imaginable to make your drink bomb. You must order their bacon and peanut butter burger, but only if you really like peanut butter.  Sounds disgusting, tastes delicious.  The cream cheese jalapeno burger is a winner as well. I would have to come back and check out the scene in the evening to grant this place the full 5 stars.

The only reason I will be going here is that it's the closest gym to my house.  After my free 1 hour personal training session that came with joining, it will take all my energy to walk back into that place.  I've never seen such high pressure sales tactics.  The dude trying to sell me their outrageously expensive personal training packages just wouldn't take no for an anwer.  When I said I needed to ask my husband about the extra money, he said "I'm disappointed that your husband doesn't support you and you have to ask him about that kind of thing."  What an a-hole.  I walked out at that point (before I ripped his face off).

I was moderately entertained watching all the drunk douchebags try to ride the bull during the Sunday night contest.  I was really hoping one of them would spew chunks, preferably on a spectator, but my wish wasn't granted.  I give them 2 stars because I discovered the aforementioned douchebags, who were wearing bandannas and sleeveless shirts (ugh), actually worked there.  My server, however, was cute.  So not a total disaster.

The only reason why this place gets two stars is because the service was good, very friendly and prompt.  It does not, however, make up for the fact that the food was terrible.  If you have "mozzarella bar" in your name you should know how to make good mozz, not the tough tasteless slabs we had on our cheese plate.  The poor shrimp on my pasta entree were cooked past the point of no return.  The bolognese sauce had no flavor, and even the house made pasta, arguably the best part of the meal, was slightly overcooked.  You're way better off going to The Parlor right across the street.  The prices are the same and the quality is so much better.
