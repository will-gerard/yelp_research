If Costco pulls Dinesh D'Souza's books off the shelf I will never shop at Costco again. I will also return the tv I purchased recently from there and I will never spend money there again!!!

If you are in to Hot Chocolate like me then you know it's hard to find a good cup at any Starbucks because frankly their hot chocolate is awful. If you want a solid cup of hot chocolate you are not going to be able to top Royal Coffee Bar's chocolate. Simply put its the best and it is a great place to nerd out on your laptop to get some work done. The people are super nice and know how to make coffee as well as HC.
