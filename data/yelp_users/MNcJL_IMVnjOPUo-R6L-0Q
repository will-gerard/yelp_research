I have eaten at many thai restaurants and this place is great! One of the best.  They will accommodate my spicy palette and throw in some extra chili's for me as well. If you are in the downtown Mesa area I recommend it highly.

When I started going there when it opened, it was great. But, seems like they are having a hard time keeping spice levels consistent and the amount of protein in the dish is low in comparison.  I've even ordered extra meat and been dissatisfied.  It is possible they forgot to add it to my dish. The chicken has a distinct processed taste that does not make the dish enjoyable. Even with the spice level that I enjoy, I can still taste that unpleasant flavor of chemicals and hormones.  With some people's spice preferences, there "thai hot" level is not hot enough and they should consider adding another type of chili to cater to those that would prefer something hotter and just not more added chili powder which will ruin the dish before making it hot enough for some. Afterall, it is called Thai Chili....I would think they can and would offer those types of chili's in their dishes. Not just plain chili powder, curry and jalape√±os which are inconsistent in heat levels.
