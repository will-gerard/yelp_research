We just moved to gold Canyon a few months ago and are year round residents. We frequent the many small businesses in the area.  My wife and I had dinner there for the first time today.  First the service was not great, our server, Missy was inattentive and really put out the vibe that she hates her job.  The menus smelled like stale beer. We ordered the sage pizza and wings.  The pizza was edible but not great, reminded me of frozen pizza the center crust was very thin and soggy.  The wings were good, we had the MO wings.  To be honest, we probably won't be frequenting this restaurant again.  Which is unfortunate in trying to support the local businesses. Change the crust of the pizza and add more sauce and cheese, and employ better wait staff. Then maybe I'll be back.

My wife and another couple decided to go to Postinos at 7:00.   We were advised that it was going to be an hour wait. No problem  we will hang out in the front couch and have a few glasses of wine while we wait.  About 10 minutes later the hostess shows up and tells us we can't be sitting there, we say ok....   She moves us to a dining table by the bar, and proceeds to state we can sit here for dinner. After sitting for 30 seconds at the table we started getting soaked by the misters.  One of us went back to the hostess to be moved to a different table. She stated it would take a few minutes.  So we hung out at rear patio area, another 30 minutes went by with no call.  We went up front to the hostess and our name was dropped from the list.  Then they gave us another table up front and it too was soaked with water from the misters.   Now an hour and 20 minutes have gone by with no seating in sight.    Very disappointed at Postinos The wait staff with the drinks and water were great, but we will never  go there again.   We walked across the street to Liberty Market and had our meal there within 20 minutes. It was excellent too.

We recently had to leave out of town in a hurry due to a death in the family. A friend recommended perfectly poochy. We called Jake and Megan to watch our dog and three cats.  The both came over to meet our pets and were very professional and personable. Our dog,  Sydney, a large Shepard mix,  took to them right away.  They walked our dog in the morning and made sure she had her two potty breaks in the morning and evening.   When we got home no mistakes in the carpet and came home to a clean litter box!   Will be recommending and using them again in the future!.
