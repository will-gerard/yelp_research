More than your average corner market or grocery store. You can certainly do your everyday grocery shopping here but it wouldn't be the most cost effective option. If you are looking for a high-end grocery store with fresh sushi, meals, salad bar, pastries and much much more than this is the place for you.  OMG!! The wine and liquor section puts Total Wine to shame. As a sales rep / promotional model for a major liquor company I can be picky but always find what I'm looking for here. :) I've never been disappointed with the service, even if it's just coming in for a little gift and card. The gift section is great too.  You must try their chocolate covered strawberries if you like that kinda thing.

I can't say enough great things about this place. But most importantly I have NEVER had a dish that wasn't absolutely amazing from here. Everything is delicious.  Some of my favorite dishes include; The Spring Mix salad. You can add a side to your dish and I highly recommend trying that. The Cajun Jambalaya. Oh my god. This is my current favorite. It's got a bit of spicy flavor to it but not overwhelming. My 2-year old daughter even eats it.  The Spaghetti & Meatballs. Classic and the best that I've found in Arizona.   I could go on and on but I'm just getting hungry thinking about it! Great bar and wine selection as well.   Reservations for parties of 6 or more.  I usually get To-Go and its ready quickly.

Less than impressed with the customer Service after I had gone for dinner with my friends and we were sitting on the patio and found a roach infested Asian where their dining area is.  When we first sat down a little girl at the table next to us noticed a cockroach and said something to the waitress to set the bed little girl was not right must've been mistaken. So we just let it go only to later find that under our table near the brick wall was a huge cockroach investigation and I saw dozens of them after I signed the flashlight on my phone to see why the wall up like it was moving. After being completely disgusted and we ran inside like total girls to have a manager come up to us and act like we were over reacting when this was right under our table.  I'll be the first to tell you how amazing their food is however after seeing that and knowing that the waitress blatantly lied about it I'm pretty disgusted. Not to mention that the manager didn't want to even offer to do anything about it and I was not about to ask.  He informed me that they spray for for the cockroaches every week and that that was enough however I would disagree since they are still there and right where people are eating. If I were you I would highly recommend not sitting on the patio area!

The staff here leaves little to be desired. Never have been greeted, asked if I need assistance or even thanked for shopping.  The name of the store is quite securing since items are NOT 99 cents only. Items can be $2-$3 on average.  The selection is pretty good but they are always so busy and rarely have more than a single register open, leading to long lines and wait time. They sell EXPIRED infant fever medicine! I had to bring it to their attention only to be given a attitude about it.

Now I see why people say awful things about this location and the staff. The customer service is appalling and the staff truly don't care the least bit,.. Nor does the management.  I'm not a huge fan of McDonald's anyways but on my way home from a long day at the base taking care of paperwork since my husband passed away. I decided to stop through the drive-through with my daughter and pick up some french fries and a drink for myself. Additionally since my daughter was so good while I was taking care of my errand I decided to treat her to an Oreo McFlurry.  Absolutely everything was wrong after I had placed my order! I pulled up to the first window and paid for the fries, flurry and drink. As usual the french fries we were absolutely disgusting and not fresh! Instead of a Dr Pepper like I had ordered I received a diet something. Grrr...! Then the worst part of all was the Mc flurry. Which they never told me that her make flurry shake thing was down and not operable. Instead they just let me pay then go to the next window and handed me the Mc Flurry like everything was just peachy keen. But before I handed it to my daughter I looked at it and the layer of cookies had not at all! After I noticed that I had asked them if it had been mixed since the spoon was different and judging by the thick layer of cookie it appeared not. It was then that I was finally informed that they had apparently ran out of the spoons that make the McFlurries. Apparently they ran out of the spoons to do the mixing so they decided to put cookie mix on the bottom and the top and I was to do the mixing myself. I don't know about you but seems a bit backwards. So after I was told that I needed to do the mixing I asked for a separate cup in spoon so that way I could have a spoon for when the one that they gave me breaks from mixing as well is it, so it doesn't get messy. They give me the smallest spoon and the largest cup possible. I would've simply settled for the same size that you gave me the first time and the bigger size of make flurry the snack size cup. But I'm sure it was a direct way to aggravate me since I had asked for the information on where I provide feedback. The problem is very simple to understand they have no concern for losing their job or the location being closed simply because of where they are located which is right outside of the military base so their customers will come to them constantly. It's really a shame.

Love Joann Fabric stores!! You can use competitors coupons and there is no limit to how many you can use unlike the other craft stores. This location is particularly busy especially on weekends so you can sometimes expect a pretty long wait for the fabric cutting counter. The staff has always been really helpful and friendly. Great fabric selection and much more including scrapbooking, miscellaneous crafts and educational craft supplies.

Why does it have to be this location that has all the good crap??  I once found a large Pillow Pet that was a limited edition American flag print. This was a total score since my children are up obsessed with those ridiculous Pillow Pets. It's actually kind of annoying, but that's not my point.... My point is that the pillows are normally at least $20 so finding one at the $.99 only store was a deal!!  Unfortunately, The staff falls short of providing excellent customer service especially when it comes to the horribly long lines at checkout. This has to be the most frustrating part of the whole experience.  Let me just emphasize how busy this location is. But no matter how busy they are for how many people are in line they only have two registers open, that's right only two!! You can expect the lines to go down part of the aisles and be waiting quite a while.  However, I continue to go back for the great deals! I'm just that cheap.

You get what you need. The basics. The staff is not helpful locating anything. In fact the staff was just downright rude.  I got what I needed and left. Hopefully I don't ever need to go back there.

It's a Taco Bell so if your expecting a detailed review on their menu look elsewhere. It's the same shit they are serving at all the other locations.  Review is on the customer service. Super nice and friendly staff that goes above and beyond. I come here occasionally but always drive thru. Is it only me that seems to always get their drive thru order wrong?? This is the only place that has always got it right.

I  love this Nordstrom location. The staff is ALWAYS so helpful and works to find me exactly what I'm looking for. I'm quite the Nordstrom addict, especially because of the way they treat their customers. I have a personal shopper for me. No additional cost but super helpful. I got a random call on my phone one day stating I was a preferred client so I get a designated personal shopper. Woohoo! (I'm going to add that I'm not little miss fancy pants either. I go and shop the sales and the fact that they price match is amazing!!) I mostly use the personal shopper to help me dress my two year old twins and 5 year old. She is so sweet and always gets me great deals!!  It's nice to call or text and have stuff ready and waiting to go through before I even get there in their proper sizes. I mean this woman probably knows my kids sizes better than me. Plus she works within my budget.  If they don't have something in my size that I love they will order it and ship it to my door for free!

This is one of my absolute favorite local treasures. Get ready for greasy but hot and fresh fries wrapped up with your hot dog or sausage.  I personally love the hot beer sausage with no relish.  Trust me about this hole in the wall that accepts CASH ONLY. You won't regret it! The area is questionable and unfortunately I'm deducting a star for the customer service. But if u want good Chicago style dogs this is the place!

I used to see a provider here for a while and departed after I saw how unprofessional the entire staff is. The front office staff is always rude for no reason at all.  The providers have no respect for your privacy and DO NOT follow HIPPA guidelines. I knew they were sharing my medical informations with other patients because I had the other patients tell me what they even said.  If your a DRUG-SEEKER then this is the place for you!  I knew of a patient who was likely abusing their medication that their provider was prescribing. So I called to let them know since I was concerned. NOTHING was done to verify that the patient wasn't abusing their medication. The least they could have done was a drug test, but nope. All they want is your money and will write you a prescription for whatever you ask for without even verifying your claim.  I have no doubt that the providers here will be losing their license to practice medicine. Stay far, FAR away from this place, unless u just need meds to get high.

Nice and friendly staff greet me every time I go in.  I sent in three Gucci handbags to be repaired since they were starting to have signs of wear around the handles and dirty. I also paid to have them cleaned which was an additional $10 each.   I wouldn't have had an issue with that however the repairs were not done well and I brought the purses in needing the repair more than a cleaning which I paid a lot for and it wasn't done properly or at all. I don't think they are capable of repairing the leather and would not recommend even though they're very friendly and nice.  I could've done a better job with scissors and a lighter! Giving them two starts sense they did clean the bags and they look clean for a good price but disappointed with the repair. I will post photos. This place is a total joke. After being screamed at by the Korean man and woman "owner" I left and am out $70. Beware. You have been warned!!

I consider this my home church.  I was baptized here nearly 2 years ago.  I love that I can attend as a single mom with ZERO judgement.  If you are at all familiar with CCV then I'm sure you have heard how large this place is. That is true. And it can make it difficult to connect with others unless you join a small neighborhood group.  You can watch sermons from the comfort of your home via your iPad app.  They have very trained childcare staff. Each age group is divided accordingly. No complaints there. Each time I attend I feel like the message it meant directly for me. I also like the casual setting.  They are always very friendly and welcoming.

At a native to Phoenix I have tried many Mexican restaurants and this place has always been my favorite!  Best chips and salsa! The chips are usually brought out fresh and hot. There is 2 salsa types (mild and hot). I like to mix the mild and hot. My kids eat the mild. So it's not too spicy at all! Burrito Fundito with pollo is the best. But I have also had the pollo quesadilla. Love the enchiladas and tostadas. Basically everything is good!! Margaritas are good. Beer on draft comes in HUGE glass. I ordered a beer and when it got delivered I had to just laugh at the huge glass.

I stopped in for a last minute birthday treat for my sons 5th birthday. I had been working all day and was so exhausted but hoping to order a last minute pizza cookie for my son. Unfortunately you have to place your orders for that one day prior so I wasn't able to order the pizza cookie.  I was kind of disappointed and one of the staff members must have noticed my disappointment so she immediately offered to try to create a happy birthday cookie on a smaller cookie rather then the large pizza size cookie. It was an incredibly kind gesture which turned out to be amazing! Having someone go out of their way to make something so special for my son meant the world to me. We need more kindness like that in this world.  Thank you Paradise Bakery staff. You will be seeing much more of me!!!

I absolutely LOVE In-N-Out burger. Unlike all other drive thru food places they have a simple menu and seldom get an order incorrect.  Look into the "secret menu" items. Some are addicted to the "animal style" fries but I'm not one of them. I do love that they will cut the burgers into 4 pieces for my little ones. They also have grilled cheese on the secret menu.  I'm a fan of the strawberry milkshakes but I've also heard you can get a napoleon milkshake with vanilla, chocolate and strawberry.

Always has the best selection of top designer trends. Selection varies from designer jeans to the latest and greatest accessories. High-end boutique items! Exceptional quality.   Ive been shopping at Roka since they had a location in the salon and spa on 51st Ave and 101. (Oh my, I just realized that's about 10 years!) ..  The staff has always been courteous and helpful. Best boutique on the west side and probably in the entire city Phoenix-Metro area. I need to stop in soon to do some summer clothes shopping.

After a horrible experience at UPS down the road I'm thankful for the help of FedEx. FedEX was able to ship my long awkward size package for less than HALF the cost of UPS store!!  Uriel was super helpful and patient dealing with me. But because of his customer service I will be going to be going back again very soon and continue to use them for my personal and business shipping needs. He even hooked me up with some coupons for next time !! Can't beat that.  Highly recommend coming here to ship for your Christmas gifts since the wait is little to none, unlike the nearby USPS.  Thanks again Uriel!

I really wish they would get with it and price match Amazon! Amazon has books available with same day or one day delivery at no additional charge so I feel like they're missing out on a lot of business. However I tend to be very tactile person and like to look in touch should check out what I am purchasing so I tend to not just buy from Amazon alone. However the price is a major factor at some point and I take that into consideration when making a purchase.  On my most recent visit I was able to score a pretty good deal on a touch and feel book for my nephew that would normally be a $10 book that they had for $4 or $5.  I would simply expect that was such major competition out there such as Amazon that they would be more willing to price match and set of not doing anything at all. I understand that there's cost involved with having a storefront however if I'm gonna pay more I would expect the staff to be a bit more friendly unlike what I experienced tonight. I was on the hunt for seek and find books such as where's Waldo for my kids, which by the way can also be found at CVS. Nonetheless, when I asked if there was anything other than Where's Waldo, the response I got was quite rude and not helpful. I would've expected that the woman working in the children's section would know what products are available and options. But then again I guess I have high expectations. ...So it's off to Walmart I go with my high expectations in search of a couple "Seek & Find" books.....

I absolutely love this pizza place. They have a couple of locations throughout the valley but the location is my favorite. The staff is very nice and helpful.  This location has indoor and outdoor seating areas.  Great for kids since its s casual atmosphere.  The pizza is amazing and the best. The don't have boneless wings so that kinda sucks but the regular wings are good. The pizza can be a bit greasy for me so I just blot it with napkins. Most people wouldn't mind but for those out there that are like me just a heads up.

Love this boutique!  Brilliant idea of adding high end consignment items too! I typically shop the sale items since some things can be a bit pricy but they are quality items.  Family owned and operated!!! Great selection of infants, children's and women's clothing along with accessories. My daughter got the cutest Frozen dress with Elsa and Anna on it. As you can imagine she absolutely LOVES it!!!  Super sweet staff and owners.

Great location! The last couple of times that I went in there I brought my 2 year old twins (yikes)... But the staff kept them content with stickers and the hats. I honestly can't stand going to sit down eat with kids since it's stressful. Maybe it was the stickers or the French fries but my little munchkins loved this place so now they get a strawberry shake if they behave.  Bribery works like a charm! (Don't judge me!) The food is always great at IN N OUT. Fresh and not a long wait. Last time my brother ordered a 4X4 and if u don't know what this is then u need to check it out! It's 4 burger patties!! Yes, 4!! I will be coming back again!

I love Jamba Juice and I feel like it's harder to find a location nearby when I need it. Thankfully this location isn't too far and it's conveniently located off the i-17 and Thunderbird Rd. Everytime I go in there the service is quick, not super friendly but worth it when I have my Jamba Juice smoothie craving.  I'm pretty picky about my smoothies and prefer no chunks of fruit that haven't blended but I also don't like them over blended and watery. I know, I know... But I admitted I was picky. I can't complain about the consistency of the smoothies at this location since everytime they have been excellent.  I love the Strawberrys Wild with Orange juice instead of Apple Juice. Orange juice with strawberries and bananas. Yum!  You can thank me later.

Came through the drive-through to get my regular iced coffee with white mocha and a cool lime refresher.  I noticed that there was cones blocking off the drive-thru but continued to the window anyways, where I was informed that there was a nationwide --actually I was informed by the staff that it is worldwide-- system shutdown of some sort.   They were unable to accept payment but the Barista, Maximo, was so kind and gave me a free iced coffee for me and my mom.  My poor little mommy has never had their iced coffee, 2% milk with white mocha pumps.  She was chugging her coffee faster than me, lol... We both approve.

This place has always been a long time fav. Especially when I was pregnant I craved the Broiled Chicken Salad with Lemon vinaigrette. The tangy goodness mixed with the broiled chicken and fresh greens was absolutely heavenly. In my opinion you'd be hard-pressed to find another salad this great in the Phoenix metro area. Amazing food and I love how rr Love the kids meal with the proper portions of fruit, vegetables, a grain and meat (with the tofu option).... Even my picky toddlers are willing to eat it.  I'm not a big pita fan so I can't give u my personal feedback there, however I do know that everytime I go there with someone they comment on how good their pitas are.

I love this place and the drive-through is especially convenient on my way to work every morning.  They have a video order window and are only one of four in the nation!!! So super cool and I took a picture.  The staff is incredibly friendly and always so nice I highly recommend the ice coffee as well as the cake pops and vanilla scones. Yummy!

Waited around far too long to be helped. Completely ignored by the staff on a not busy Friday at 3pm. The free valet is a nice feature however the staff needs to step it up on their customer service.  If you are lucky enough to get assistance then you are likely to find some great stuff that is fashion forward and good quality items. I'm just not up for waiting around for nearly 20 minutes to get help at the jewelry counter.

Download the mobile app for additional savings with coupons. 1 coupon per transaction.   I am so disgusted at the ENTIRE Michaels staff and how they were so impolite and downright rude to my little 4-year old with special needs and myself. Staff there clearly have ZERO respect for special needs children!! Even the (male) store manager kept giving him weird and unpleasant looks.   So much for going and getting the kids a fun craft for the holiday.  They can count on me no longer shopping at this location and quite possibly all the other Michaels locations. Don't mess with my kids. I completely understand if I was letting my child run wild and destroy the store but that wasn't at all the case.   I'll just let it be at that since I want to keep my review from containing all the horrible things that I want to say to them.

This was my first time actually going in rather than just using the drive thru to just pick up my prescription.  Upon entering the store I was pleasantly surprised with how clean and well kept the store was.   I am honest that when it comes to my produce, I AM PICKY! It needs to be ripe and de-lish. Usually I only find produce this good at Whole Foods or occasionally Safeway. The selection was nothing short of a full grocery store with pharmacy.   But you know how when you go to WalMart and its a ghost town whenever you actually have a question or need help?? Well this place isn't like that at all! I actually had someone offer me assistance within 3 minutes of being in the store. I was in shock.  After doing my shopping I went to pay and there was no line to wait in. Score!  Ok so great selection, great produce but not a full WalMart Supercenter... But the best part is that they are a location for the Walmart.com Site to Store shipping pick-up! If you aren't familiar with how that works then you are missing out so look into it.  Only issue is the wait time of pharmacy prescriptions. I understand that there are others waiting but when it's been nearly an hour over the quoted time frame and my 2  year-old needs his pain medication from coming back home after a surgery, I would expect them to at least stay within the scheduled time or not be rude when I stress the urgency of my son being in pain.   Drive thru pharmacy. Red Box location. Store is open 24-hours (pharmacy hours are different) Excellent parking situation, unlike a super center!

This Circle K is below average due to the cleanliness and customer service. I once went to get a Dr. Pepper Thirst buster from the fountain drink dispenser and it just splashed and spurted out nasty soda water and the woman who was working there (clearly restocking cups, etc) just laughed and said it was out. I politely asked if it could be restocked but was told it would take about half an hour. Huh?? I know better.  Everytime that I'm here I'm approached by someone looking for money. It's unfortunate that this location is so close to my work and not one that is cleaner. And NO I will not give a damn quarter!!

Professional and knowledgeable staff that help with the treatment and management of pain.  Love this office. They don't tolerate drug seekers and they drug test you upon medication request.  They have been helpful with pain relief options for my chronic back pain. I am so happy to have been referred here.  If you are looking for a doctor to just give you pain pills and send you on your merry way then this is NOT the place for you. This is a legitimate pain management provider. Trigger point injections, Lumbar facet injections done at office. My provider has been helpful finding a treatment plan that works to manage my pain.  Tip: DO NOT EVER BE LATE.

Clean play area. Well maintained games for even the younger children.  My children love going here with their cousins to play and enjoy the pizza.  I would recommend this place to other families with young children. Great for birthday parties too! Only taking one star away because the food isn't the best. But let's be honest, it could be worse for a place that is kid friendly.

It's simple, the food it yummy, the staff is friendly and they have a full bar.  But here is the trick, if you are anything like me then u are always eating it at home since I'm not about to haul my 3 little munchkins in there for mommy to get a margarita with her chips and salsa. ... So, don't forget to order your chips and salsa if u have a take out order since it's an addition charge. It's worth it, trust me!  My absolute fav thing on the menu is the nacho supreme with shredded chicken. My kids love the shredded beef taco or cheese enchiladas. Don't forget to use their mobile app for coupons and their loyalty program.  ---after a horrible customer service experience there recently, I'm done with this place!

This is my favorite big box baby store. This is actually a sister company to Bed Bath and Beyond AND they accept their coupons!! So don't forget to bring your 20% off an item coupon!  About the actual store, it has the same layout at Bed Bath & Beyond, which is where im you walk through the store in almost a circle to go through each department. Up front is seasonal items and in the very back, near the restrooms is the clearance items. (That's where you will find me because I'm always looking to score a deal!) The products; they sell higher end baby products including strollers (Bugaboo, Orbit Baby, Bumbleride, Britax, Stokke, Phil&Teds, Quinny, BOB jogging strollers, and so much more! Car seats are also the top of the line (Orbit Baby, Chicco, Maxi-Cosi, Diono, etc) They have the most trendy and adorable baby Nursery decor. They also have the usual diapers, wipes, baby lotions & soap, bath toys, and much much more. Now, the clothing situation,... I have twins so I shop both sections. They carry the basics, by that I mean onesies, cute little outfits for baby showers. They also have some unique stuff too, such as tye dye onesies and beanies. I also found some nice baby and toddler size hats on clearance for $5.! They were Arizona Cardinals and Phoenix Coyotes nice baseball hats that are regularly at least $25. I tend to shop the clearance section for the most part unless I see something I need. Lastly, but this is pretty important, The customer service. This is the only reason why I'm deducting a star. The staff attitude towards you isn't fantastic everytime. I know that some of the staff I worked with have gone above and beyond (typically when I'm spending a bunch of money on stuff) but other times they seem to not go that extra mile. But for the most part they are friendly and helpful.

Advanced Pain Management has 9 locations valley-wide!! With the primary doctor being Dr. Brian Page who is absolutely AMAZING.   I wrote my review on the Dr. Brian Page company so I will mostly just copy and paste but tweak s few things to this particular location since I have also gone to the other location by Metro-center.  Professional and knowledgeable staff that help with the treatment and management of pain.   Love this office. They don't tolerate drug seekers and they drug test you upon medication request.  They have been helpful with pain relief options for my chronic lower back (tailbone) pain. I am so happy to have been referred here.   If you are looking for a doctor to just give you pain pills and send you on your merry way then this is NOT the place for you. As stated you will be drug tested regularly. This is a LEGITIMATE PAIN MANAGEMENT CENTER!!  Trigger point injections, Lumbar facet injections, SI Injections, and nerve burns all done at office. It's so important to me that the only option isn't just pain meds!!  My provider has been helpful finding a treatment plan that works to manage my pain.   Tip: DO NOT EVER BE LATE. Arrive early for all appointments and try to avoid missing or canceling your appointments as much as possible. If you are running late call and let them know.

Large location. Post office boxes available and open 24-7. Self service kiosk is open 24-7 making it very easy to ship your packages at anytime of day or night.  Typically the lines are pretty long and this is during the busy hours however during the day you'll be able to get in and out fairly quickly. The window service hours are Monday through Friday 9 AM to 6 PM Saturday 9 AM to 5 PM and close on Sundays and holidays. The post office at this location is very clean and well kept.  For the most part the staff moves at a fairly fast pace to save you time and the shipping rates are in my opinion the best around. I especially love the option a priority mail shipping with the two day option. This would be my local post office since it's closest to me.

Five Star review because this place is always friendly, the food is ready (everytime so far... Not like other locations in the city), and the prices are amazing for yummy pizza and breadsticks.  You have to order the Italian Cheese Bread!!! It's $4 and it's my most favorite thing from this place.  My kids love the pizza which I will be honest, I was a little leery about feeding my kids food from a place that has $5 cheese pizzas. However, I was pleasantly surprised and now this is my go to lazy dinner place. (No joke!) I used to live in NY and this is certainly not New York style pizza but sometimes after a long day at work feeding my family seems so be much easier with a quick stop to pick up some pizzas and be out in less than 5 minutes, everytime! BAM!! Highly recommend!

This review is specific to the pharmacy. I have had several issues with the female pharmacist. She seems to get great pleasure in frustrating customers with their long wait time or inability to fill a prescription.  CVS has a drive thru which would make it convenient but after the terrible customer service I refuse to go there anymore.

In-n-Out Urge takes over and I need those freshly cooked French fries, cheeseburger topped off with a strawberry milkshake and I'm in fast food heaven.  This location is conveniently located right off the I-17 and always busy. The drive thru line extends around the building and is always so long but in the end it's worth the wait. The food is NEVER less than expected.  Some swear by the "animal style" fries but mine are delish just plain.  The menu is simple but that's all they need.

This location is nice and close to my house and has an excellent selection of snacky-snacks. Which is always a good thing. A great tip is that if you use your Fry's VIP card frequently then you can earn points towards money off gas. You could save up to a dollar per gallon of gas which is great. The program works very simply and for every hundred points that you earn on your Fry's VIP card you would get $.10 off per gallon so for this particular trip I got to save $.20 per gallon which adds up to quite a savings and I love that program since Fry's is right too! I am deducting a star for the flow pumps that they have. I feel like it takes so long to fill your tank unlike any other gas station in the valley. After reading some of the other kids and reviews I noticed that I'm not the only one that has this problem.  The staff in the convenient store is always courteous and helpful.  Altogether I'd have to say this is a great place and I'm lucky to have it near me!

The history of Saguaro Ranch Park is enough of a reason to check this place out.  This is a hot spot for local photographers since there is a variety of landscapes. I've done several photo sessions here and recently was informed that you will now be required to have special permission and/or a permit. If you are caught breaking the rule they will ask you to leave. Please respect their rules and be courteous. As a child I called this place "Peacock Park" since there are peacocks roaming around. Do not scare them or chase them. But if your calm and patient you may be lucky enough to capture a photo with one. In a recent maternity shoot I did there I captured the shot at just the right angle and the to see their completely outstretched feather fan. Gorgeous! Okay now if your looking for a park that you can bring your children to .... They have a great play place for the children of all ages, as well as a spacious picnic area and large grassy area to run and play. My children absolutely love the play equipment which has been recently updated.   Saguaro Ranch Park is certainly worth a visit! But please remember to respect the rules of the park and the precious peacocks!

I called to simply get a price quote and schedule of classes for CPR BLS training.  Yikes!  The woman was incredibly rude and short with me. Thankfully I found a much better place to get my CPR certification that ended up being much cheaper (a student discount) and the staff there was actually kind and helpful.

This place is huge and so much fun for all ages. I love that the park is pretty well enclosed by a fence since I have 3 little ones to chase. The major play place is 3 stories high with huge slides that are state of the art. It appears safe too since the top is completely enclosed by bats so no area to just fall off.  They recently redid the park area and it was well worth the wait!  Now they have almost all the areas shaded (major plus!!) There are 2 areas that have sand with "fossils" to dig up.  Smaller child play area too. My kids absolutely love this place and it give me time to do some studying or work.  Be sure to bring cash to ride the train! $3.50 per person or a book of 14 for $28. The ride is nice. Highly recommend!!

This place is fantastic! The staff is incredibly friendly and accommodating. I got a gel French manicure and I am so pleased with the turn out. I've seen this salon grow and evolve over the years but the owner, Ben, always makes sure you love your nails before you leave and is incredibly friendly. You will love it here!

Let's start with the positives, as few as there may be, I still feel it be fair to mention them... Well,... Ummm.. They have a convenient drive-thru, it's on my way to work and there rarely is a line.  After getting food poisoning here recently I've been much more leery about returning. Especially since the Managment didn't care whatsoever!!. But I can tell you that the Department of Health Services did and filed a report of my family getting food poisoning.   Just a warning.

This is my local neighborhood bar and Grill which is always a go to for me when I want to have a drink with a friend or somebody special but still keep it fun and semi intimate.  I can honestly say that I have not tried the food here. However,  I have seen other orders and they look like more than just your typical bar food.  I typically come in for the drinks and drink specials that they offer.  I would say that I've been here approximately 5 to 6 times at least, and I can't say a negative thing regarding the staff, the location, or the patrons!  This is kind of a hidden gem for us in the Northwest Valley. If you're in the area I recommend stopping in for a drink and something to eat since this place is very friendly and reasonably priced.   I'm not a smoker. However I must add that I love the outdoor patio because it gives you more space as well as the ability to have an intimate conversation without a bar noise.

Love this location since they have a great selection and everything isn't all picked over.  You can find great deals at the dollar tree and I'm a true bargain hunter so I love it! EVERYTHING REALLY IS ONE DOLLAR... Sometimes even less!! Today I scored some pool toys for the kids, a funny dress up dinosaur hat thing for my son who is obsessed with dinosaurs, (really what boy isn't), super glue, zip ties, storage bin and 5 solar powered exterior lights. 10 items for only $10.81 ... SCORE!! Staff is always helpful and friendly.  You can even order online and get free shipping.

I've been a member here for a few weeks now and am so glad I gave it a try. I signed up for a monthly membership after getting a free pass online to try a class. I tried the Hang Yoga and have been hooked ever since!  Now about the actual Yoga Studio, Instructors and variation of Classes that they offer:  Location: 39th Ave and Pinnacle Peak Rd in the Northwest Valley. Also just minutes from my home.  The Studio and Equipment: This studio is better than any others I've been to for a couple reasons but primarily because if u forgot your mat, blocks, bolsters, etc. then they provide it! The Yoga Hang Out boasts 2 large classrooms. One for the BARRE and Hang (inversion) Yoga. That classroom can accommodate at least a dozen people comfortably as well as the other too. The other classroom has ample space and used primarily for the traditional yoga classes. Both fully equipped with music system and all necessary equipment for students.  Instructors: I haven't had a single issue with any of the staff or instructors. Each instructor fits the vibe of their class perfectly!  Classes: They have classes everyday of the week. There is an up to day schedule of classes available by downloading the app. I really love that feature since I can save my spot with the press of a button! They offer Hang Yoga, Barre (Trim Barre), Goddess Yoga (loved it!!), traditional Yoga Flow, Yoga for Older Youth (summer only, I believe) and other classes such as a Stretch and Restore.  I really wish they offered Mom and Tot Yoga, or a baby and mom yoga or even Pre-Natal Yoga. But maybe in the future...   Overall this place is all around excellent and highly recommend!

So pleasantly surprised with Living Spaces. I went in there for my first visit today and as a mom of 3 children I immediately noticed the double push car for the kids to ride in while parents shop. I loved the prices here. When I first walked in I felt like I should turn around and immediately walk back out because everything was so beautiful but looked expensive. After being dragged around the store by my mom I looked at the price of something i really loved and noticed it was actually very reasonably priced.  I count get over how cute the little girls bedroom furniture was.  This place is a must see for any new decor projects.

I love my iced coffee.  This location is located just inside the Frys grocery store.  It's not a full Starbucks free standing location.

I love my iced coffee.  This location is located just inside the Frys grocery store.  It's not a full Starbucks free standing location. They also cannot redeem your Starbucks rewards like a "regular" start bucks location can.  Polite and friendly staff who are always extremely helpful.

I had to have dessert first. It was all so amazing! Pizza takes 3 minutes to cook. Many options of pizza plus yummy salads. Everything is made fresh.  and right in front of you. I went in and there and was able to order my food right away which was great since I was starving. The pizza was thin crust and delicious. I'm not a thin crust fan but it was so good.  The "Pookie" dessert was better than sex. Vanilla bean ice cream on top of a freshly backed cookie.  I also had a soda. All for less than $15!!!  I will be back for more and soon.

A store just got containers, perfect for those type A personalities! I love the acrylic shoe boxes for my closet and they even have some for my purses.  This place really had so much and I think I'm in love.  My mother, who is a total type A personality frequents this store often. Unlike me, where I just come in for what I need or "the basics" This place has put organization on a whole new level.  I recommend checking if out and I will have to post some photos of my shoe and purse boxes shortly.

Had the best experience at this Denny's. The server was courteous and went above and beyond.  Taking 3 kids to eat out anywhere is no fun, especially when they are all preschool age and younger. With that being said it was refreshing to have a server that understood the importance of getting the kids taken care of first. She was even kind enough to do high fives with my boys which made them feel special. My daughter was content just coloring and eating. So while I ate my food she came over to briefly show my daughter how to color a smiley face. It was little things like that that made the experience pleasant. I didn't expect her to do any of that but because she did I greatly appreciate it!! The food was great. I get the Build Your Own grand slam.  The decor was unlike any Denny's I have ever seen before. I noticed they even had a large meeting room for larger groups of up to 50 people. Brilliant!  And get ready for this one.... They will be serving beer and wine shortly. Woohoo!!!  This is not your typical Denny's and I hope other locations will follow suit.  **bonus** get 15% off your entire order when you check in on Yelp!!
