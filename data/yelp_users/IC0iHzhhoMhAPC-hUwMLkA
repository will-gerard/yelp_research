I always have them deliver, it's quick and convenient. I love their Mongolian beef, I always ask for extra spicy. Good chinese and reasonably priced.

Just like all the other reviews have said, this place is totally unsuspecting. When you walk in the front lobby is decorated with granite, tile, glass and high ceilings. I was offered a water right away. After I checked in I got a robe, and sandals. I was taken to the spa waiting area. The waiting area has a small water area, where you can soak your feet in warm water. Or you can rest on one of the couches. The receptionist gave me a warm shoulder wrap while I waited. I had a 1 hour Swedish massage, which was great. I got dressed and then got a pedicure. The salon only uses OPI nail polish and has updated colors. I loved my experience there. Will definitely be coming back.

Waited an hour to get my car cleaned. They did a poor job of it, and I will never come back to this place again. Their employees look like they just got out of jail, and were cussing in front of customers.

I'm big on service. We were ignored when we entered the place. Sat down for another 10 minutes and no one approached us. We left & went to tilted kilt. I'm not giving any establishment my money who doesn't understand basic customer service skills.

Very romantic atmosphere.  Service was excellent. Food was good, and the view was gorgeous. Definitely recommend for date night. Try their homemade gingerale.

Best donuts in west valley hands down. My fianc√© loves the cherry bomber. I love the traditional fritter. They also have a variety of hot coffee. Their Hawaiian delight was awesome!

I wasn't very impressed with this place. I had a large order and every dish was just ehhh. Butter noodles were bland, my son had the Wisconsin steak sandwich and didn't care for it, the Mac and cheese was okay but not very cheesy except for on top. The pad Thai had good flavor but the noodles were soggy. I also had some sort of Asian noodle dish with beef, that was okay as well but nothing I would want to order again. Don't think I'll come back to this place. It wasn't horrible, but nothing I tried made me want to order from there again.
