I got my garage door replaced by them 2 1/2 years ago and the spring just broke a few days ago. For the amount of money we paid I'm sure a spring should last a lot longer than that. We gave them a call and they said it's not covered. Terrible!!! Now I have to go through my home warranty and get a service done by someone else.

UPDATE! :)   After posting my previous comment and being out $100 from the home warranty because they don't fix door springs, the owner of the company Thomas reached out to me. He was very professional about the issue and was willing to work with me on fixing the garage spring. He changed my one spring to 2 springs and just charged a very small labor fee which I thought was pretty fair.   Thanks so much Thomas!

I've been here any times before and the food has been great .. Until today. It is a Saturday so you would expect things to be fresh but that wasn't the case. Quality of the food is not what it use to be before. It is no longer worth $22. And don't even bother coming for lunch.    Let's talk about service... If you get a lady named Vickie you are going to have a bad time. She never came to ask us how everything was which I don't expect much since it's a buffet. But we weren't even eating dessert yet and she brought us our bill. She even lectured us about how much to eat! Seriously rude! I gave her the 10% off yelp check-in to adjust our bill and when she brought it back she pretty much threw the bill at us. This was probably the worst service I've ever had. We also overheard her complain to the other customers about why she didn't get a tip. They said the service was horrible. At first I thought that was rude but now I know exactly why!!

I reserved a table here for my birthday dinner for a party of 10. Table was ready for us right away. My friends brought in a birthday cake for me but we weren't allowed to because if their policy which is fine. They were able to store it for us. I think the manager or owner felt bad so he gave us a bottle of champagne for the table. THAT is great customer service right there. He was so friendly and welcoming! I totally recommend this place!   As for the food, everything we got was delicious! Duck breast, pork shoulder tostadas, steak, pork shank. Everyone loved their food. The carrot cake and Mississippi mudcake was amazing!!!  Thank you for the wonderful dining experience on my birthday!

I LOVED this place and the guy and girls that work here!! They are very helpful and just so nice and friendly! I go here once a week to get my strawberry fields. I can't get this same perfect ripe strawberry anywhere else.   Great customer service! Thank you so much for staying a bit later after closing time just so I can make it there after work!!! :)

These are the best cupcakes ever!!! The cake is very moist and it's a pretty generous size. I love this place!! The decor is also really cute inside. They have ice cream there too, which I will try next time. Wayyy better than Sprinkles. This place is worth a try!

We went here on opening night!! YES we did!! Waited 1 1/2 hours just to order food which I understand because it's their first day so we were willing to wait.   I really hoped that it would be worth it. We got 3 types of ramen since we were getting half off on the 2 for the opening special and a fried rice. They used plastic bowls and tiny plastic spoons... Terrible idea when serving soup... Unless they only did it for the grand opening. The noodles were all bland. We weren't able to finish any of it! And that's with me starving myself in the line. I had to load my ramen with almost the whole container of the flavoring. Best part of the meal was the gluten free noodles that I substitute one of the ramen for and the fried rice. Along with the other Yelpers, I was also kinda drooling over the package of ramen I exchanged. :)   I hope the lack of flavor is just because they're still trying to sort things out. So I might give this place another try later down the road. Service is nice and friendly though!
