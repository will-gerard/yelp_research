Walked in with my mom so she could buy some shoes.  The girls working there must have been having a bad day because my mom wasn't treated well at all.  Tall /red head in a green dress threw a box of shoes on the ground so close to my mom because my mom didn't like the style that was brought to her.    What a shame- we would have bought every pair that fit and had a good style. Bad service.  Bad attitude. For no solid reason.

My boyfriend and I walked into this restaurant to try something new.  We sat outside.  The service was extremely slow.  Our server looked like she was not all there- she could hardly speak in complete sentences and her eyes where rolling around.  We ordered and when our lunch came out - I was totally disgusted by the smell of my plate. I picked at my food and the Quinoa vegetable smelled like sour milk or rotten something. My boyfriend had the roast beef sandwich and the meat was spoiled- he had an upset stomach and soon after he was vomiting. The manager asked us to never show our faces again at the restaurant. Trust US....we won't.  The health department needs to pay a visit to his place.

Daniel Malventano (owner)....is back in the neighborhood and once again...EXCELLENT food!  The Biltmore area is known for outstanding restaurants and Caffe Daniel is one of the BEST in it's relaxed, classic..well lit setting.  Michel the chef- makes this duck that is so tender and delicious (and I'm not the biggest fan of duck..but Michel knows how to do it right!).     Stop in for a panini/salad for lunch or experience Caffe Daniel's amazing dinner menu......

I had the 90 minute Lymphatic Massage and 30 minute Inferred Sauna treatment last week.  What a great experience!  Our bodies need this treatment at least 4x a year...look at it as cleaning out your system seasonally.  The price is excellent for 90 minutes..$135.00!  You will not receive treatment like this at a hotel that is for sure.   I highly recommend.

We were told to use Strawberry Hedgehog for dry irritated skin.  MAGIC!  Love love the product and have been using it for five years.
