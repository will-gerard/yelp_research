It's been robbed on 2 different occasions while I was shopping there.  I go to the one at Osborn and 7th Ave now.  Better selection, bigger store, cleaner, safer.  EDIT  +1 STAR  One redeeming value - Good place to flirt with hipster girls buying hummus or whatever. At least until her girlfriend returns with the chocolate chip cookies and kicks your ass.

Stay away. Far away.  I had been hearing about Fate for a while. I had high expectations, since I had been to Lucky Dragon in the past (the owners prev joint) which was OK.  It was the worst Chinese/Asian I've had in AZ, the service was terrible, the chairs uncomfortable, and to top it off my fiancee got food poisoning.... and has been sick for the last 2 days from it. I took her to the ER this morning at 4:30 AM and decided to finally start posting on Yelp since I've been a lurker for a while.  Aesthetics: Initially looks like a typical hipster restaurant like you might find in another city. Nice patio, cool inside.  However... The seating at a bus stop is more comfy. There is no chair back - just this high bar thing that digs into your back.  I'm going to file this under aesthetics - we ordered the Hot and Sour soup (more on that later) and the waitress suggested it was large enough to share. However, they apparently don't have any kind of serving utensil, so we had to use our little soup spoons to serve ourself soup into another bowl out of this wide shallow terrine. WTF?  Service: I don't know a nicer way to say it, our waitress was a dopey bimbo. It took 20 minutes for her to take our order. She went missing for long periods of time when I had an empty water glass, and then for a while longer after I tracked her down and asked for some. Not good.  Food: I ran into a friend there, and he commented at how he loved the food and was surprised we didn't like it. To be blunt, it was utter crap.   The hot and sour soup was thin and spicy. That's it. It tasted like chiles and a splash of rice wine vinegar- no other flavors present. It's not like any hot and sour soup I ever had.... in a bad way. There are these weird chewy dumplings like things in it that would be better served at protecting the floor from your chair leg.   I ordered some Saigon basil something or other dish with beef, she ordered the Lemon Grass whatever with tofu. My dish was bad. The beef was sliced thin but tough and chewy, and totally lacked flavor. As for basil, there were 2 small basil leaves in the dish, and that's it. The sauce was thin and one dimensional.   Her lemon grass dish was also bad. The sauce tasted like Tom Yum paste from the chinese grocery store mixed with some water. I felt bad for the poor abused tofu.  I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants.... but Pei Wei and Pickup Sticks are about 10x better in terms of food quality and taste. Screw that, even the chinese place in the mall food court is better. I am not exaggerating. It was a very disappointing meal.  Now for the nasty part. I drank water - Fiancee unit drank th 'Green Tea.' It was like no other green tea I ever had seen. It was leprechaun green, with some kind of milk like substance in it.I thought it looked kinda funky, but she drank it.  It was the only difference between our meals. I tried hers, she tried mine, etc. I didn't drink the science experiment tea.  Well... Several hours later she started having stabbing stomach pains. She spent the whole night up vomiting and with diarrhea.  2 days later the vomiting has subsided but she's missed 2 days of school and is still pooping up a storm. I took her to the ER at 4:30 AM this morning and they confirmed the symptoms were consistent with food poisoning. Admittedly she had just gotten back a 45 days ago from a trip to a 3rd world country where she got (and recovered from) a tropical disease so her immune system is not at it's strongest right now, but come on. This shouldn't be the end result. Plus this IS downtown Phoenix so there are plenty of people around with compromised immune systems, if you know what I mean, due to lifestyle choices.  There is some great Asian food in Central Phoenix.   Maxim and Da Vang are great Vietnamese places on 19th ave. The Cultural Center has a few great places, esp Golden Buddha.  Thai Lahna has been consistently good for years. Like I said I don't eat a lot of chain food - but even the Pei Wei at 7th ave and McDowell is way better in terms of food quality.

I'm not generally a fan of chains, but sometimes I eat here.  They follow instructions well. I can get something relatively healthy to eat, with little fuss, and it tastes pretty good. The personnel are polite. The food is fresh. It's clean. It's close to my house. The foot long chicken breast is $5, and they don't act like I have horns on my head when I ask them to remove some of the bread from the middle of the roll. The subway sandwich toasting machine is fast and nifty. I'm a fan.

Kristi's review said, "Great romantic spot to bring a date. Secures that you will be getting action later, trust me." Well, that's good enough for me. And before the Yelp paparazzi shows up to muckrack... no I didn't take Kristi to Cheuvront's. I know better than that - I only hang with Kristi at dive bars.   So I did take my lovely date to Cheuvronts. The decor and ambiance - think wide open and urban and dark without being too dark. It really set a mood. We ordered a bottle of wine from a fantastic list, along with a cheese plate and a pate plate. We had them select the cheeses to pair with the wine we had chosen with a few instructions as to cheese preferences. They have a selection of pates as well, and we had them choose similarly.  The cheese plate contained three cheeses, all superb. It was served with (good!) bread, some nuts, and some dried cranberries. The two pate plate was similarly served with bread and dark, delicious mustard. The pates were fantastic - the cheese plate and pate plate seemed destined to be served together.   The food and drink were great, the service a little spotty especially since there weren't that many people in there. I'm guessing the waitress just didn't want use to feel like she was bothering us. After taking our time to enjoy the wine, cheese, and pate, we were both feeling full with no room for even dessert.   Overall, a great meal, my date thought it was one of the best places she had ever been to, and I'm clearly going to have to pay more attention to Kristi's reviews.

One of the better mexican places in central phoenix - and there are no shortage of them.  All the standards are great. The chips are always fresh. The salsa is HOT. Yum. Their guacamole is freshly made. You can't go wrong. So go.   Some of my favorites Cheese crisp w green chiles Albondingas (mexican meatball) soup Shredded beef taco Green corn tamales  Some of the items on the grill menu are superb!  Pork chops (with fries and beans - ask for cheese on beans!) Short ribs   You really can't go wrong. It's inexpensive, fresh, home cooked, clean, and delicious.   Only downside - the margaritas are kind of weak. On the other hand, they are cheap, so you can have 3 and it won't hurt you too much. :)

Things to order that you might not normally order - but should.  Ask what chinese greens they have. They usually have a bunch that aren't on the menu.  Order steamed with garlic. Chinese broccoli, ong choi, gai choi, bok choi are my faves. Order with black mushroom if you're feeling freaky.  The "casserole" menu is chinese hot pot. The taro one is great. My favorite is the fish filet and tofu. I order it with sauteed, not deep fried, fish, and soft, not deep fried tofu.   The fish fillet and green onion is superb.  On the thai menu, the papaya salad is the bomb.  The frog legs are pretty good! :)  The noodle soups are great. So is the congee, if you're into that.  Try some of the more exotic stuff on their menu. That's where they really shine the most.

Dear fucking lord I am not going to eat again until next Thursday.  A friend took me here for lunch today, in exchange for a little 'puter help. The cook is a friend of hers, he just said, don't worry I'll make something you like.  Next thing I knew I had a Scheiners freshly made hot dog, grilled, split open, on a bun... with a fried egg an some of their pepper concoction on top. One of the best things I have ever ever eaten.   As others mentioned, the fries are sliced to order and fried to a super crisp.  The eggs are organic. The menu is tiny, it's diner food, but the food quality is very, very high.   Has a few bites of a freshly made pear pie.... oh my.  I will be back, but not that often, otherwise I'll be a lardass. (again)

The motherfucking dive bar of strip clubs.  If you BYOC (bring yo own company, bitches!) it is awesome. In this case, I was the company for a totally non-trashy, very classy female friend of mine who was in the mood to slum it. She lives down the block an had been wanting to check the place out for a while, so after a few hours of daydrinking, we hit the spot.   Wow.  Stretch marks. Lots of grinding and wandering hands. Tits everywhere... and shit, that's just the male patrons, holmes. I was wearing all black (as usual) and put on my sunglasses for the lulz now and then, and my exceptionally skinny and lovely companion was paying with a stack $1's that she won in a dice game the night before... so the ladies and waitress probably figured that she was a stripper (she's actually an RN in an ICU) and that I was her coke dealer, and the guys were jealous that I was hanging with a hot babe whom I didn't have to pay for attention. So I guess that made me by default the coolest motherfucker in the place. How could I not give it 5 stars after that?  In reality we had a sociological discussion about the patrons and employees, and discussed a few articles in the latest issue of the New Yorker, which she happened to have in her purse.   Some of the characters we saw:  Saigon '68 - Old dude who only got dances from the asian girls, reliving the glory days in 'nam.  Hombre - in his sunday finest with cowboy hat and boots, looking very confused. He might have jumped the border last week.  PCC - White haired, super thin, wrinkly cracker who probably wandered in from the Phoenix Country Club across the street, in shorts, white polo, knee high white socks, and of course velcro sneakers. He looked reminiscent of a corpse.... except when he got several dances from well endowed black women, at which point he really became alive.   Short Dick Man - He had clearly sprouted some wood, and it wasn't very impressive.   Vatos - galore.  So - think dive bar that is totally ghetto fab. If you wait around long enough, they'll have 2 for 1 drink specials, though I am sure that the "grey goose" I ordered was some shitty well shit and not the goose. Whatever.   Ghetto fabbbbbbbbbbbbbbbuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!

Definitely a hidden gem!  I have eaten everything on the menu.  No, not all at once. I've been going for years.  The best baja style mexican seafood in town.   Even the raw oysters are fresh and delicious.  You can't go wrong.   SRSLY. GO.  They don't always take credit cards. I'm not sure why. Bring cash just in case.

Decent but not awe inspiring North Indian style food in east Phoenix. I haven't been for their lunch buffet in years, but dinner is good and reasonably priced. Their idea of hot is not that hot.  Things to try that I especially like here -  Mango pickle Any of the paratha breads Hot tea Anything with cauliflower

Forget the frou-frou "best in the country" BS hype. You know were I'm talking about.    This is as close as you can get to real pizza downtown-ish. All they are missing is the red checkerboard tablecloths. Red Devil could be in Anytown NJ or NY and fit right in.  No Rays are nearby... Red Devil is a close 2nd. Their wings are great, too, as is the lasagna.

Shortest review ever.  Awesome mozzarella, super fresh basil, tomatoes that taste like tomatoes, real bread. These are a few of my favorite things.   Anyone who gives this place less than 4 stars - don't go back, you don't deserve this place. Go play in traffic or DIAF or something.

I love Bikram Yoga, and I especially love this studio.  Because of some recent changes in my life, I've committed myself to doing certain things to improve myself as a person. I've done yoga in the past on a regular basis - and those were the times I felt spiritually and physically lighter.   If you're not familiar with Bikram, he's this Indian yogi who came up with a series of asanas, or poses, which are designed to increase blood flow to all the organs and muscles and tissues. The focus required is very mind clearing. The poses, performed in a 107 or so degree room, are designed to compress and stretch muscles and organs - compressing to push out blood, and stretching to fill them with fresh blood. Your body will eliminate many stored toxins. You'll lose weight and develop better muscle tone and you will feel mentally wonderful. The closest thing i can describe the feeling I have after 90 minutes of Bikram is to being high on drugs. Only you aren't - you've done something wonderful for yourself.   This particular studio is a Bikram franchise run by a lovely woman named Brooke. She has been practicing Yoga for years and when you meet her you'll see how it's effects radiate outward from her. There's a very inspirational story in an old New Times about her and how she came to do yoga. Literally - it saved her life.   The studio is at Central and Camelback, near AJ's, way way in the back corner and very easy to miss. Just to to the corner, past the fountain, and look to your left.   All the instructors are superb - they all have to be officially certified to teach Bikram. The studio is very clean. It is a very comfortable and peaceful environment. The instructors and other students are very friendly. The mens and womens dressing rooms are equipped with showers. You will sweat like you have never sweated before.  They have all kinds of specials for new members, and a number of different membership types ranging from blocks of classes to unlimited monthly membership. If you're starting out I suggest reading about Bikram Yoga first so you're prepared. Bring water, bring a large towel, bring a small towel. Dress comfortably. Take your shoes off at the door. You can rent a yoga mat if you're just trying it out for a couple dollars.   I've been to a few other studios around town and this one is my absolute favorite.

A&J is the bomb. How have I never written a review for this place is a carnivorian conundrum, given that I have been a customer since the mid 90's.   The links are juicy and delicious. The rib tips and ribs - superb. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The prices are very reasonable, too.   It's a pretty no-frills strip-mall location... but you aren't going for the ambiance. You are going for the smoked meaty treats. The beans and cole slaw are smokin' too, and the owner and employees are are friendly.  OMGLOLBBQ I love A&J.

Joe.... I love your nuts.  Also... I love your cheese.  Nuts.... Mmmm. Raw nuts. In my mouth. So firm and tasty.  I don't even feel funny saying that, and I am a very hetero guy.  I do the bulk of my shopping here, though for veggies I'm starting to hit up the Phoenix Public Market.  But for everything else... I eat from Joes.  The refrigerator case Greek olive medley... wonderful. The cheese selection, especially the choice of feta, is wonderful. There is an incredible Israeli sheep milk feta, and the low fat Trader Joes brand is no slacker, either. I also love their fresh Mozzarella in salt water. Their hard cheeses and brie are great, and I love goat cheese - they have a wide selection.  I also love their organic tofu, their Greek yogurt, and mmm... nuts. Good balsalmic in a mother fucking spray bottle? I am all over it. Their olive oil is excellent. Their wine selection is great, as are the prices. Dr. Bronner's soap? Yay! Free range, organic eggs... Bring it on. Joe, I eat your eggs with abandon!  They have new products all the time. I am addicted. Addicted. Is there a 12 step program for Trader Joes? I hope not. It's one addition I plan on continuing to feed.

I have been to the Apple store 2x for warranty service... Once for a power supply, another time for a new battery. The Apple Geniuses are friendly, helpful, and fun to interact with. The layout is neat, clean, and efficient. Overall they do a great job of using their retail space to communicate what it's like to use their products.

I've been here a few times recently, in various different social situations - romancing, bromancing, and a business meeting.   Wow.... is all I can say. The happy hour(s), $5 wine, is a great deal. The food is superb. I think it's a hoot that it's in the old 'Synthony' location, what was once the coolest pro audio and keyboard shop ever. The ambiance is awesome - cool, urban. cultured. The service and knowledge of the servers is above par. It's usually packed. Definitely one of my favorite places for wine in town! I wish I'd been going for a long time, and didn't just get clued in recently. I'm glad I don't live closer... I'd be there all the time!

I no longer buy jeans anywhere else. For some reason, the brands they sell at Buckle fit me like no others. I don't even mind paying $100 a pair, vs. going somewhere else and trying on 10 pairs to find 1 that fits alright.   If you don't mind paying that much for a pair of jeans which were assaulted in ways that make them look both old and busted yet like the new hotness, all at the same time, then Buckle is for you, too.   Just so you don't feel like a total chump, the $100 a pair jeans are all made right here in 'merica. Yee haw!

I have to say, Yelpers. We have it pretty good in Phoenix!  I fly a LOT. Over the last year, I've taken about  dozen business trips - a few of them multi-leg. In 2007 I took just over 20 trips. So, hardly a month goes by where I'm not flying. I spend a LOT of time at airports all over the country.  When people talk about Sky Harbor, they mostly mean terminals 3 and 4. 2 is primarily international.   4 is the newer of the terminals. 3 is older, but still not bad. Southwest and US Airways use Terminal 4, both of which are popular airlines in AZ.  Either of them are pretty good compared to many other cities. Especially terminal 4 which is crowded but plush by airport standards.  Free wifi. Plenty of AC power plugs for laptops and other devices. Lots of dining options - both behind and in front of the security checkpoint. Clean and plentiful bathrooms.   Sometimes the security line is long. Sometimes it isn't. It isn't the airports fault - they are all manned by the same idiot TSA employees, no matter the airport. The airport doesn't hire these mouth breathers, only the Federal Government is capable of hiring incompetents on such a massive scale. :) And they hire the false security guards for every airport. They'll give you and granny a body cavity search while the guy in the Osama bin Ladin t-shirt or whatever goes right through. Oh well!  The luggage pick up areas are easy to navigate. The airport is clean. There are lots of parking options. We have the largest car rental lot in the country. If you're waiting to pick someone up and you're early, look for the 'cell phone lot' signs, and hang there until your visitor shows up and calls. It's right next to the pick up area.   I mean- compare it to other airports. JFK? JFK is a dirty shithole with a serious mouse problem. O'Hare is a running joke. San Diego - all best dining options are outside the security gate. WTF?

I hate this place, but since they have the only roller coaster in the state... (FAIL!) - they get 5 stars, because folks... this is as good as it gets. Here, at least.  It's an amusement park, sort of, if your idea of amusement involves waiting in line for 20 minutes with a gang of pint-sized thug-wannabees.   On the other hand, it's fun to use your adult driving skillz to put the pedal to the medal and smoke their asses on the go-cart race track. Brakes? I don't need no stinkin' brakes. I mean, seriously - I outran and lost a police helicopter on the 51, I don't need brakes on a go-cart. (See my review if the 51 for details... True story.)  The roller coaster is actually fun, and the line is typically short because the entrance is nearly impossible to find.   If this place had any competition, I'd give it a 2... But I go back, anyway, because they don't.

I am a long time Vietnamese food fan... this place is right across the street from my office, so I hit it up for lunch pretty regularly.   I've had the beef and chicken pho, and the bun (noodle bowl thingy), not tried the sandwich yet, but I will.  The soup broth is great. The noodles are tasty.   The beef soup is my favorite - it contains the yummy viet style meatballs, rare beef, and brisket. Only complaint is that it should come with more herbs, but this is Scottsdale... not Da Vang or Maxim on the Wessyde.   The spring rolls are pretty good. I've had better, but I order them sometimes, anyway. A Viet spring roll is wrapped in rice paper, with noodles, pork, shrimp, and herbs inside. Not deep fried. Yum. Eat with peanut sauce, and some chile sauce or sriracha.  The bun (noodle bowl) is really good, too!  It's clean, the service is fast, and the food is tasty and healthy, unlike most everything else in that shopping center.   To the person who said they never saw a Vietnamese sandwich before... fail. :( It's a wonderful result of the sad history of French colonialism in Vietnam, and these days, typical Viet fare. I love them at Da Vang, and will have to try one at Tea Light some time soon. Expect an update when I do! But... the pho is so good, I don't usually stray from it.   Down side: With a belly full of noodles, I want to take a nap.

I was in the hood and visited for lunch today.... was super impressed.  I ordered the special, which was a Japanese hamburger.   The beef was tender and delicious. The burger was huge, and had a tasty sauce which made the burger, like, super duper umami.   It came with a salad that had a tasty dressing, a bowl of rice, and a small seaweed salad.  What a delicious meal!  I didn't order sushi, but split an order of monkfish liver (!!!!!!!!!!! a favorite of mine) with the guys I had lunch with, it was sublime and wonderful.  Most of their lunch menu items are $9-$11, for the quality and quantity they served, I felt it was a good value.   I will def. be back!!

It's the only "all ages" venue for miles, so it was weird to see 12 year old punk rock kids slam dancing with adults. A little disturbing, too.... but funny, for sure.  The mixed drinks aren't designed to be tasty, they are designed to get people super fucked up and come in a giant mug. That should tell you something. They had to call an ambulance for one girl who apparently slammed 2 long islands and passed out. Two? They are gigantic. Think like 7 in normal terms, maybe.   There was a video on the TV over the bar playing, in which people were beating each other up with metal folding chairs.   I wish I were making this up.  If you want to see a bunch of mediocre bands and maybe a good one, once in a while, bring some friends and get trashed. I repeat - definitely bring your own company.

This is one of my favorite places in the valley - there's always something new here, and it's big enough that I don't often get to walk the entire thing in one visit.   If you visit often, I recommend a membership. $75 gets you in for free, but the $200 level gets you invited to all 4 private exhibition event evenings.  The $100 level gets you invited to two.   They host frequent lectures and all kinds of interesting events. You can always find something  going on, on their calendar.  Some of the permanent collection I am very fond of... Seeing the same exhibitions a bunch of times is kind of like visiting an old friend. There is always something new to appreciate. The rotating and visiting exhibits are always well presented, as well.   Arcadia Farms is a fantastic place to eat, the healthy slow food really fits. I mean, what do they serve at the Met in NY? They have a shitty cafeteria. We have Arcadia Farm bitches! OK so the Met has a huge Egyptian temple and Dutch masters paintings, but we have this weird reflective black plastic concave/convex thing and a dark room full of hanging LED's and mirrors.   There is more culture in Phoenix than the out of date yogurt in your fridge!

I live walking distance from this place, but don't go there nearly often enough... Most recently I showed up and they were having a kooky robot party, where people were dressed in robot costumes badly made from cardboard. DJentrification was playing robot-voiced breakdance music. It was quite surreal.   The drinks are cheap and strong. It's kind of ghetto fab. OK, it's a dirty smelly shithole full of drunk homeless bums, hookers, hipsters who drink shitty cheap beer, ugly people who are also soap deficient, and the occasional confused scottsdaleite slumming it. If you like that kinda shit, you will love Bikini.

5 stars for a neighborhood fast foodish dive? Yup.  Carne asada is great here of course, but really, I love being a 4 minute walk from some of the best Birria de Chivo ever. Big chunks of lamb, little chunks of fat, in a spicy, soupy broth.   Great head, too. By that, I mean I love their cabeza taco.   Plus, they are open late.

Mostly I go here because it's the closest real bike shop to where I live.  Still... the people who work there are all bike enthusiasts and are a wealth of knowledge. Their prices are typical for a LBS (local bike shop) IE a couple bucks more than online.On the upside, you receive your goodies right away and the level of service is good.  Just today I bought some new Maxxis Hookworm tires at Landis, came home, put them on.... went out to hit some local street riding spots, busted some air.... and mashed up my back rim. Sigh! :) I was hoping to get a night ride in.

I bring them my dry cleaning and shirts that need to be laundered. The next day, they're done by 4, perfectly. I bring them 10 or so shirts and some sport coats and pants on a regular basis - they've never lost or damaged anything. Service is always friendly. They do all their own cleaning onsite.  Not a long review, but what do you want from me? It's a freaking laundry. Go launder some stuff.

I went with such high hopes, too.  I had the red curry beef. Well, the beef was very strange in texture and oddly shaped. I hope it was beef.   My friend had some kind of stir fried shrimp, green bean, and curry/chili thing. The flavor was very mediocre. By that I mean, how the hell do you make something with curry and chili bland?  The papaya salad was not very good - too much lime juice, and a bit of an off taste.  We both woke up the next morning with stomach aches. Coincidence? I don't know. But I probably won't be back, either.

Mostly agree with the other poster. It's not so much a sketchy part of town as it is just plain old Central Phx. It's the West Side, but not the Wessyde! if you know what I mean.  The best pho in town, hands down. Pho is a vietnamese specialty - a noodle soup that comes with a large plate of fresh herbs that are torn up and put in the soup.  The rice paper wrapped spring rolls and thin crispy egg rolls are great. The decor is plain but the food is fresh, inexpensive, and outstanding.  Don't even bother with the chinese dishes - they're plain and not the focus of the place, unless you're going to order Chinese broccoli in which case go ahead.  The soups are delicious. Great broth, either pork with egg noodle or beef with rice noodle. The duck soup is also superb.   Better than a lot of Pho joints I've been to in Socal, and that's saying a lot!   It's family owned and run, they are very nice hardworking people, and they go out of their way to make you feel welcome.   Some of the beverages are great - Pennyworth, young coconut, and of course the french press coffee with condensed milk, a Viet staple.   Look on the menu for #72 or #78, forget which, which is ground beef wrapped in grape leaf and grilled - it comes with a plate of herbs, rice noodle with sauce and peanut, some dipping sauce, and dry flat rice noodle type disks that you dip in hot water, put in your hand, and assemble the beef, herbs, rice noodle, etc, inside of.

I have been eating here for years. It's always just as as good as the last time. The service is always attentive, the Pho is wonderful and large, the herb plate is generous, and it's very clean. The level of ambiance is about 0 and it feels a little like a cafeteria, but what do you expect from an ethnic dive where their specialty is a $6 bowl of soup exquisite soup? That adds a certain charm to it.

I love this filthy little shithole!  I have eaten here countless times and swear that I had reviewed it before... guess not?  Much bigger menu than Maxim down the street. I like them both, Maxim maybe has better soup?, but it's great at Da Vang, too.   Just went for lunch with a friend - friend had chicken pho which was good, we split an order of spring rolls, which were tasty as hell and full of transparent rice noodles, shrimp, and pork. I got a lot of exercise in the last few days and my metabolism is feeling fast at the moment so I pigged out... a vietnamese bbq pork sandwich, which had greezy but good pork, jalapeno, carrot, bean sprouts, and cilantro,  and a crepe which was filled with bean sprouts, shrimp, and other tasty things. They bring tons of fresh herbs with your order.   Total bill: $14 and some change... for both of us.    Everything was fresh, the food came up fast despite the crowd, and I felt satisfied. Nap timeeeeeeeeee.  If you like dirty little ethnic dives and Vietnamese food... check it out. OK it's not that dirty. Just a little. Whatever. Think of it as atmosphere.

The other reviewer who mentioned breakfast must have come on a bad day. They have one of the best country style breakfasts anywhere. Huge portions, delicious, and very satisfying. You can't go wrong with their breakfast.  For other meals... not bad. Not great, but definitely a good value and satisfying. One plus is that they serve diet dr. pepper... but not at the 19th ave and Bell location.  (?)  Nothing goes better with BBQ than Dr P.   I like their all you can eat beef ribs when i want to get into a carnivore coma. I prefer them dry with sauce on the side... then us mostly the hot sauce with a little bit o' the normal stuff.  It's a good place to bring out of towners who want to eat at a cowboy type AZ place.

Anyplace you can get a decent drive-thru gyro or cheese steak (get the cosmopolitan) is OK with me!  Their burgers are good too... but gyro and cheese steak ftw.

Best wings I've had in AZ since Minder Binders closed shop. That's all I really need to know in order to be a fan. I see no point in mentioning any other details.   I've only been there at weird hours, never when it's crowded. Off-peak it was a great, non-pretentious place to eat.

So I saw the reviews... and thought.... it can't be that bad?  They have a large list of wine by the glass, but they are mostly in the $12-$15 per glass range... and nothing special.   I was there with a friend and ordered a bruschetta appetizer... I should have taken a picture. There were 4 cracker size crostinis with a tiny piece of mozzarella, a couple little basil pieces, and a half a cherry tomato on each, for $9. Each piece was almost a mouthful. Come on guys... it's a bruschetta, not sashimi. For $9.00 you can do a little better than nearly 4 small bites, where each piece isn't even a mouthful. They were TINY. Where did they even GET these crostini? From the fucking Keebler elves?   On the upside the staff was nice and they were willing to turn on a heat lamp outside for just the two of us. And the "Marilyn Merlot" posters in the men's room were pretty spiffy.   The wine was OK, but nothing special and way over priced by the glass. The Bruschetta was tasty but tiny and overpriced. The 2 stars are because it was not a good value. I am not a cheapskate and don't mind paying for tasty vittles... but I like to feel like it's worth it. In this case, sadly, I didn't.

All the bad reviews have me puzzled. Most of the things complained about are things I see as a plus for this kind of bar. After all, it is a dive bar with a rowdy crowd. It's called Rogue. This isn't your grandpa's Snowbird Scottsdale and it isn't full of  douchebags with shiny shirts, with their blood full of anabolic steroids and their scrotum holding shrunken testicles, and fake tans, and girls with... ok some of them are surgically enhanced. Personally I don't have a problem with that...  Try this as an exercise. Read the 2 star reviews. Look at the things being complained about, but turn the sentence, in your mind, into a praise instead. I picked out a great quote from one review... Think of this one in a positive instead of negative light and you'll get a whole different idea.   "Not to mention if you want a free show of someone blowing someone else, screwing, fighting or snorting things this is THE place to be."  HAHAHA. That's from a 2 star review. I dunno. It's a dive bar. To me, the fact that it's small, crowded, with cheap strong drinks, and people doing crazy shit is a plus.   I don't hang out at bars on a regular basis. I go if there's a DJ I want to hear and want to get my boogie on, or if friends are going. Since most of my best friends live in other cities, it's not usually in AZ. I only drink to the point of being drunk once every other month or so. But.... When I want to go somewhere that is crazy and stupid and full of freaks, this is where I go. I feel a certain kinship with crazy stupid freaks.

As Freud said, sometimes a cigar is only a cigar.  Implicitly, sometimes it's more.  The perfect cigar is to me a reminder that human civilization can still be refined and sophisticated. I love cigar shops. Fresh, properly cured, properly stored tobacco has a rich, delightful odor that stimulates the olfactory senses, and makes it's way to the pleasure center of my brain. It brings to mind a nose reminiscent of leather and a fine red wine, a rich smell.   I played hookey this afternoon to visit with a friend, we had some lunch and then went over to Churchill's for a cigar and to discuss the current state of the human race, interpersonal relationships, and other deep subjects. We each picked out a cigar. The tobacconist clipped the ends perfectly and had a lighter for us to use. The tobacco was rich and delicious, having spent it's entire life locked in a perfect temperature and humidity controlled humidor.   Unlike bars, you can actually smoke inside. The best seating is outdoors, covered by an awning and topped with misters. Its a very comfortable place to relax, even when it's 111 outside.  To top it off I ran into an old friend I lost touch with years ago while there and it made me even happier to see that in the years that passed she turned from being a slightly awkward girl who was all elbows and knees but with an inner warmth that is apparent to all who meet her, into a beautiful, graceful, successful woman - but still radiating the same joy for life. I didn't wake up expecting to have a cigar, either. Sometimes it's nice to just sit down for a while and savor the moment in time you're currently inhabiting. Cigars always seem perfect for that.

The service was not awesome.  My falafel was mediocre. The pita was kind of cold. There was way too much lettuce on it, and the lettuce was also sliced way too big to be practical.  My friend had a veggie burger with cheese, they put 1 square inch of cheese on it - what? And, it came on burnt toast? Hm.  I will not be back any time soon. What a disappointment.

Went for the lunch buffet 40 minutes before they closed - the management let us order off the normal menu but charged only buffet price. The food was deliciously prepared.  Saw some comments from other people about the neighborhood - it's fine, unless you're terrified of Asiatic engineering students.

One of my favorite Arizona style Mexican joints. Their chips are always hot and fresh made. Their salsa is nice and spicy. The red is a little smoky. The green is hot and flavorful. Their guac, if you order it, is fresh made and tasty.They have a few stand out items on the menu.  Albondingas Soup - mexican meatball soup. It's about $5, huge, comes with a plate of refried beans and warm tortillas, your choice of corn or flour. (Corn, bishes!#@) Delicious, filling, and relatively healthy.   Tamales. I love their green corn tamales. They have green sauce on them and some hot chile inside. Yum!  Short ribs. Yup. Grilled and very meaty. Delicious.  Enchiladas. Perfect.  If you like menudo, you can order it with or without the hoof. I don't like medudo or hooves, so you're on your own, but it seems popular with patrons who have that inverse make a run for the border vibe.  The reviewers who panned this place must have smoked crack before visiting. Or filed the wrong report at the wrong place. They can't be talking about Rositas!

I ate here today for the first time since I was an ASU student long ago - it was as good as I remember. Better, because i have a more sophisticated palette now.  The hummus was yummus.  The baba ghanooj nearly made me spooj.  The tabouli ruled me.  I love the olives. Real olives. Not from a shitty can. I am an olive snob. Trust me. Order the side of olives. Do it!  Yes this review is shamelessly blatantly fishing for cool and or funny ratings.  Give me one then go to Hajis.

Location: Awesome.  Downscale, intentionally shitty and cheesy, decent food, excellent happy hour, set up like a giant courtyard,  the perfect place to get sloshed outside in the AZ summer. Or winter. Or whenever.  Plus, think about it. It has the words Gringo and Trailer Park in it's name.   What could possibly go wrong?

This was in 2008 - I posted the review below to the wrong Boa location. Oops!  The last time I visited Cafe Boa, they were in a tiny location on the other side of Mill, and most of the seating consisted of small tables on an even smaller patio.  I visited Cafe Boa with a new friend with the express purpose of chatting and drinking some wine, since wine is usually serves well as a conversational lubricant. As it turns out, no lubrication was necessary, but the wine was sure fine! We ordered the pitcher of red Sangria, which during happy hour is $15.  The waiter brought out a giant pitcher already half filled with fanta (!), some liqueur, and sliced apples, oranges, limes, grapes, and frankly who knows what else was lurking in it's depths. Then, he proceeded to open a bottle of wine, pour it in, and mix it up.  The end result was superb! Not too sweet as some Sangria can be, not too much liqueur to mask the taste of the wine. It was light, refreshing, tasty, and very buzz inducing. I think I might have said a few times, "Woah I am fucked up." Or maybe I just thought it. Hard to say. I'm a big guy, but kind of a lightweight when it comes to drinking.  We ordered the Bruschetta, which was fantastic. The bread was delicious, the tomatoes were fresh and tasty and smelled like tomatoes, always a good sign, and there was plenty of garlic - but after drinking a pitcher of Sangria, who cares about garlic breath, really?  We ordered a side of olives as well... They were mediocre. OK, they kind of sucked, but we ate them anyway. The green ones were semi-flavorless. The kalamata were eh. Given their focus on freshly prepared food, I was surprised that they'd serve these olives.  The service was decent, the price was reasonable, and the wine was fiiiiine. So is my friend, but I'm reviewing Cafe Boa here, so I'm going to try to stay on topic.  From the other reviews, it sounds like the pasta dishes are not what they once were. The bruschetta was awesome. I probably wouldn't come here for dinner, unless dinner consisted of some appetizer menu items and getting liquored up. The cheese plate looked promising... Perhaps next time! As Gen. McArthur said... I will return! Only I'll do it with my thirst, and not a huge naval armada.  Speaking of McArthur, here's a logistical note:  If you go during the week.... Parking is for crap. All the parking meters are 80 mins max.... Parking is free after 4, but that leaves you a 40 minute gap from when your meter expires until parking is free.

The only church I've ever attended.... and one of my guilty pleasures.  Fuck KFC. As the urban legend goes, they don't call it Kentucky Fried Chicken anymore because the freakazoid genetically engineered birds they use aren't chickens anymore.  Church's Chicken is where it's at. Their chicken is about 76435987435x  better than KFC.   Delicious. Crispy. The spicy version is even better.   They have fried okra as a side! Fast food joint that serves okra. How can you go wrong? The family size okra is about a pint and a half. Think of them as the Church's Chicken holy sacrament.  Their biscuits are perfect. Ask for honey. OK it's not really all honey, but at least honey is one of the ingredients. It doesn't matter. Ask for a handful of their hot sauce packets too, which are kick freaking butt. My only complaint is that they don't have greens on their menu anymore. So long as the okra is still there, so am I motherfucker. Don't miss the mac n cheese, either. It goes great with the hotsauce.  I just noticed this ghetto-ass location, which I can get to in about 3 minutes by heading down Grand Ave as kind of a short cut.  My arteries are cursing me, but my belly is thanking me.  Writing this review made me hungry. I'm going to go go make a donation to the Church right now. If you want Church's late at night I recommend you bring a sidearm (this is Arizona! Yee haw!) or try another location. Any other time it's perfectly safe. I'm not talking about protecting yourself from the neighborhood 7th ave/grand ave/van buren crackheads and pimps, either... I'm referring to the idiot hipsters who frequent the art galleries on that part of Grand. They are too pretentious to eat this heavenly ambrosia known as Church's Chicken. You might just wanna get with the vibe of that 'hood and pop a cap in one these dopes who would rather go waste their daddy's ducats at that shithole known as Fate over at Roosevelt and 3rd, just on principle.

Now worthy of 5 stars for replacing their toilet with one that actually flushes. It's always nice when a place that sells diuretic beverages has a working toilet.  ---  The baked goods are baked right there in the coffee house, by their employees.  The coffee is roasted right there, on site. Iced tea refills are free, bitches. The baristas are hep cats who ride fixie bikes. Now, I like to coast, but shit...  Gotta give them cred. If you go often enough, the other regulars will be friendly. If you hate Mac laptops, you probably should stay away. The new tables are great. There are power outlets everywhere. It's next to Pane Bianco. I run into my homies there on the regular. When it comes to coffee shops in CenPho, there is no competitor. Jeff, the owner, is a cool dude. The seating outside is nice. I have been known to spend all day there, and use it as my office away from home and my real office. I seriously probably spend about 16 hours a week there or so, maybe more some weeks, working on my laptop and occasionally people watching. Did I mention that I kind of like this place?

Oh Barcelona, I visited you with low expectations - and you didn't disappoint.  A lovely young woman of my recent acquaintance invited me here recently for the purpose of attending a birthday party for a friend of hers. Neither of us would have come here otherwise.   If you're thinking about going, don't do it. If you care for the deets, read on. If not, stop reading here and.... go somewhere else. Please.   We show up at about 8 for drinks and dinner. I wasn't in a drinking mood, my date's Appletini was pretty Appley but the amount of liquor was tini. Must be why they call it an Appletini. Hm. Highlight was the bread brought to the table - the pretzel rolls were the highlight of the evening. How sad is that?  Now... the place is called Barcelona. Barcelona is a city in Spain. THe closest thing to a Spanish dish on the menu us Paella, otherwise it's a steakhouse menu with a few obligatory pasta dishes. Totally uninspired.  I ordered the ribeye, medium rare. It came out medium, and the glaze and whatever else they put on it were awful, save the two onion rings. I doubt this was USDA prime beef. It just wasn't that good, and the room was so dark that it was hard to see what I was eating. The shoestring fries side were a pleasant surprise - a giant mound of crispy potato.   My date had some kind of pasta with shrimp dish. The shrimp were overdone, the pasta was, ok. Denny's pasta is OK, too, and let's face it, so is Chef Boyardee... So don't read too much into the complement.   Barcelona. Spain. The place doesn't look that Spanish on the inside. There is a giant mural on the ceiling, dim lights, it reminds me more of Las Vegas cheese than Spain.   While you dine, there are two Scottsdouche (or is it Douchedale?) types crooning back and forth to each other on stage. Is this where failed American Idol contestants try to relive their moment of glory? I don't know. They made a reappearance later, singing along with a DJ to a selection of bad 90's pop music with the occasional 80's party jam.   The crowd is douchey. The food is awful and on the pricey side. The service, spotty.   If you're coming for the thing Barcelona is famous for, you'll find a lot of it. If not, stay away. Far, far away.

It's a shithole but I go there because I (less and less) because  live close and the WIFI is free. I like LUX  a lot better and am more and more likely to make the trek.  Every night is either lesbian folk music night, open mic night which seems to attract talentless unbathed losers, or 12 step biker gang night.  I lifted up the toilet seat to pee one time and a roach scurried out from underneath. WTF? Don't eat food there. The roach probably ran right from the dirty toilet rim right to the kitchen for a snack.  Imagine if someone had sat down instead and the roach crawled up on them right between their legs? Shiver at the thought.  I work at home a lot and sometimes go there during the day for the free iced tea refills and wifi, just to get out of the house. Less and less as I trek over to LUX a lot more now which is clean and has a clientle that aren't mouth-breathers.

I lubz me some Famous Dave's.  I first visited one in Nebraska on a business trip about 7 years ago, we ate there about 7 times over 2 weeks. No joke.  I took a client out to lunch today, and he said, "let's go to this BBQ place down the block."  You can imagine my pure joy when it turned out we were going to this palace of pork perfection.    Their lunch combos are under $10 and huge. I had 2 tasty ribs, a giant bbq chicken breast with wing attached, corn, corn bread, and coleslaw. It was as good as I remember.  Devil's Spit sauce is the shit. Don't even mess with the others, homie.   My only wish is that they had Diet Dr. Pepper. Seriously... If you aren't planning on getting totally plowed, you have to have Dr. Pepper with BBQ. Anything else is sacrilege.  4 not 5 because there is better BBQ out there. But not that I've had in AZ, unless I've made it myself.

An evening visit to Fedex (next door) provided the opportunity for.... my first visit to FEZ... How did it take so long? What a cool place.   The semi-dark atmosphere is very intimate. I'm pretty sure it was dark enough for my friend and I to feel each other up under the table with no one else noticing. Pretty classy huh!  She had the FEZ salad, i had the tomato whatever it's called salad. Both were very fresh with lots of tasty ingredients and a nice dressing. Hers had the grilled chicken breast. At most places, this is usually an anemic dry chicken breast... in this case it was hot, grilled, large, and delicious - enough so that I was impressed. The sweet potato fries were sublime but probably 3939484949383 calories per fry.   The ambiance and service are way better than one would typically expect at a restaurant at this reasonable price point. I'll be back!

Got a coupon in the mail.... after reading the Yelp reviews I had to try it.  MAMMA MIA THIS IS SOME GOOD PIZZA!  I'm not ordering pizza from anywhere else again.  I'm an expat New Yorker and was very impressed.   The crust is perfect! PERFECT. Thin. Chewy. Not soggy. Perfect. What, do they import bottles of NYC water or something? I don't know. They nailed it though.  The cheese quality was excellent. The meatballs were home made and delicious. The sausage was great too. They aren't stingy on toppings, either.  The coupon included salad. We ordered the Italian salad - your typical iceberg/tomato/red onion salad as you might get in NYC. I wish they added some olives and pepperoncinis, but oh well. They do get bonus points for sending good salad dressing (Ken's Itallian). They also get bonus points for sending red peppers and real parmesan.   I'm excited to have finally found a decent place in Central Phoenix to order pizza from. Everywhere else I've tried has been an EPIC FAIL.

I was totally underwhelmed - and totally shocked given all the exceptional reviews from other trusted Yelp Elites.  The rice was WEIRD. There were frozen peas, carrots, and green beans in it, and I swear the rice was Uncle Ben's.   They don't really have chips. They broke up some tostadas and put them on a plate. How weird.   2 stars for the authenticity and quality of the food, lack of chips, prices not in line with the level of quality of the food, and totally overdone vibe.  Overall: Not great, over priced, overdone, and... weird.

Decor and service were great. Prices were not unreasonable. Food was delicious - I had the chipotle burger - grilled green pepper, pepper jack, chipotle aoli,  great burger. Appetizers - enjoyed the tuna tartare (served with avocado and corn chips, very creative!), the nacho plate was also very good.  The food presentation was creative. It made a a great place for a business dinner, and would probably make a good date spot, too - especially the heated outdoor area.

Friday evenings are busy, but we found a seat at the bar, and started working on a pitcher of their tasty white sangria before being seated at a table on the awesome patio, right by the fire. Even though it's crowded,  the overall vibe is warm, friendly, fun, and the ambiance is great. The food, as always, was delicious.

Small, dark, themeless, nice drinks, lots of pretentious attitude, comfy booths, everyone stares and sizes up whomever walks in the front door and engages their coolness meter, fun patio, pool table, decent jukebox. Fun!  Or...  Bunch of tryhard scenesters covered in tattoos and piercings, trying to out-weird each other while swilling their PBR or whatever.   OK, do I need to pick one?  It's a fun place to go for a drink. This is not a Scottsdale bar. The crowd is mid 20's through mid 40's. Expect to see some goths, hipsters, rockabilly types, 80's industrial leftovers, lesbians on dates, perhaps a knife fight, people on their way home from work who stopped in to get plowed, and who knows what. I only started going here recently, but each time I've gone I've run into people whom I know from other places, which is kind of neat. I am getting the feeling that it's the kind of place I can show up and not necessarily have to bring my own company, but maybe that's just me. Other yelpers seem to think it's unfriendly. Whatevs! Maybe it's you.  I brought two different first dates here recently. Later, neither turned out to be a great match for me, and neither of them really liked Shady's. There might be a correlation.   I love using the word "correlation" in a dive bar review.

4 STARS???  If I could I would be all up in giving 0 stars in this motherfucker.  I visited Ticoz based on the many good reviews. FAIL!  Is TICOZ short for TOSTITOS?  Because I swear... the chips served by the waiter were out of a cellophane bag from Costco.   Margarita.... more ice than anything. Bleh.  Service.... poor. We waited to be seated. We waited to have a drink order taken. Waited to get our drinks.   The main courses were bizarre to say the least.  The "tamales" were more like 2 scoops of sweet corn polenta.The shrimp were in a pile next to it, rubbery, frozen, slightly off flavored. The rice and beans, generic.  The burgers were more like sliders. I think the burgers are prepared far in advance and assembled prior to serving. The bun was made soggy by the watery salsa. The mayo... became watery from the salsa as well. The cole slaw was bleh. The waffle fries were decent.  The waiter was just weird. He was disengaged, unfriendly, and sluggish.  Yo what be up wit yo foolz an yo fo stah reviews?!@!  One of the worst places I have eaten in Phoenix - super trendy looking, with miserable vittles.  1 star, only because there is no way to give 0 stars.  Word is bond!

If you like South Indian - this is the PLACE.   For those of you who are worried about the bad health dept rating from last year - they fixed their problems and have had all inspections rated gold or silver since then.   Most recent:  SG63642  UDUPI CAFE 1636 N SCOTTSDALE RD TEMPE  85281  E&D 10+ SEATING  SILVER   from  http://www.maricopa.gov Environmental Services website  The lunch buffet is great - delicious South Indian vegetarian cuisine.  Dinner is fantastic, too. One of the best South Indian places I have been to - including in NYC and California. Fiancee unit who has been to Tamil Nadu state in India says the food is very authentic.

Dick's is one of my top 5 all time favorite restaurants.   The ambiance - intimate, dark, rustic, wood, copper.   Sitting at the bar, watching your food being cooked right in front of you.   The rack of lamb is sublime. The "Taos Combo" or anything on the special board, especially seafood, is always incredible. Their margaritas, cocktails, wine - all great. Bacon wrapped shrimp ftw. They come on a plate with a tortilla on the bottom, rice, beans, and sauce on top, and the bacon wrapped shrimp on top of that. The salad, which comes with many entrees, is awesome. And don't forget the flan, topped with prickly pear syrup. You can't go wrong.   It's a testament to how good this place is that they don't need a sign.

4 stars based on the sangria alone.  Order this motherfucker by the PITCHER, without apology.  If you can sit out on the patio, so much the better. if not, grab a comfortable booth near the bar.

Chinese delivery in central Phoenix! Wow it almost feels like a real city.  Almost!  The dishes are all Americanized Chinese style as you might find in many family style restaurants in NY and Cali. I suspect most people in China wouldn't recognize any of these dishes. But no worries - it's actually good in a Chinese delivery kind of way.   I've had fried rice, a couple shrimp dishes, and also beef and pork. All were very tasty. The shrimp were large, plentiful, and tasted very good. The large egg drop soup earned it's moniker. It's actually large.  It's the only game in town in CenPho for Chinese delivery. I'm sure they are doing a brisk business!  I've never been inside. I have no idea what it's like. I'm almost scared to find out!  Their delivery area is      northern 43rd      40th ave       st.    Buckeye  and the delivery fee is only $1.50! I suspect that will change.

There are 2 options for bathing your own dog, one involving you scrubbing, the other costs a few $ extra to have the soap and water pre mix and spray. It's much faster, works great, and is well worth it. The groomer who trims nails has a great natural way with dogs. For the most expensive do it yourself package + nail trimming, it was about $25. The baked doggie goods smelled so good, I wanted to eat some. The staff were friendly and helpful, I'll be back.

The space is really cool, I love the open loft type look and high ceilings and glass.  On the other hand...  - Parking is all paid parking - parking meter. Teh suck.  - Don't go here if you like people watching - it's dead, probably because not many people want to pay as much to park as it will cost to buy a coffee.   On the other hand, the music has been stuff like The Clash and Depeche Mode.   I so want to like this place - I think it's a victim of geography, though.

I live about a mile from here. How did I never know it existed?  I'm reviewing it while sitting here on my Mac Book Pro soaking up the free WIFI and a Strongbow cider, in the dark, feeling cool as fuck.   It's dark. There's lots of wood. Jazz music on the stereo. This place is awesome. I feel awesome just being here. Well, I usually feel awesome, but now I feel double plus super secret awesome and a half. And it's not just the cider talking.   As the Terminator said... I'll be back.  There's no sign. Just look for the blue and red OPEN led's in the window.  Wifi key: speakeasy.   I feel like I'm in one.

The other 4 and 5 star reviewers said it all. It's not huge. It's not perfect. But in Yelp terms, 5 stars means "Woohoo! As good as it gets!" and folks, this is what we got, so it's as good as it gets.  I echo the sentiments of the importance of getting there early, especially if you want to buy local eggs from chickens that can scratch and forage etc. A lot of he best produce goes fast, early. You never know what you're going to find there, week to week, which is kind of neat. Some of the goat cheeses are wonderful, and I don't mind buying apples with some bird peck marks on them. The birds know which apples are the best ;) It's real food. The produce is mostly very reasonably priced, and super tasty. The people watching is fun, too. It's always fun. Caveat: Never been on a Wed., only on Saturdays.

To me this is unethical behavior - to you it may not be. Make up your own mind.  Topher used to cut my hair at The Spot. This was before I decided I had lost enough hair such that It was time to break out the clippers and go bald. Bald is the new black, so not so bad.  Then some time later, I got a phone call from someone at the spot saying, we know you haven't been in for a while, want to make an appt? I said, well, I shave my head now, but tell Topher I said hi. They told me he left. That set off alarm bells. They are calling all his old customers! That just seems kind of weird and low since he was previously involved with but left the business.   I'm not going back anyway, because I'm really happy with a shaved head. But even if I had hair, I wouldn't go back. Just my .02! Take this review for what it's worth. I don't know if this is considered bad etiquette in the hair world, but I always felt like I was Topher's client - not The Spot's.

I was contacted by the owner who explained that their policy was not to contact Topher's old customers. I will take her at her word, and assume that this was an honest mistake. The new rating reflects the talent of the people who work there, the cool massage chairs, and the overall vibe of the place.

This review is for Friday nights - an event called Party Foul.   http://www.myspace.com/partyfoulaz  As the website says... "bloghouse/ bmore/ remixes/ hip hop/ retro/ hyphy/ straight up fuckin bangers all night"  If you like that loud new school dance-punk indie-electro techno-infused music that goes beep-beep and a hyperactive, slightly crazed party crowd, this night is for you.  I invited a friend recently, who asked what the crowd was like... Here is the convo:  Friend: "what type of crowd?"  Me: "Hipsters homos dance music scenesters trannies drug addicts drunk people and assorted perverts."  Me: "You'll love it."  Friend: "oh yes... my type of peeps."  If you found that amusing and intriguing as opposed to totally repulsive, go. You'll thank me later.

I didn't drink there, as I was already intoxicated prior to my arrival. I did have a burger and fries at the bar, which were both fantastic. They serve food late and didn't bat an eye at my red-eyed state. They kept my diet coke full, the overall level of service was as high as I was. Oops, did I say that out loud? I normally wouldn't write a review for just one visit, but the burger and fries were surprisingly great and I had to cut the burger in half to manage it. The bathroom was clean, too, which I find to be unusual in Tempe area bars. I'll be back!

One star. It takes twice as long to ride the line from one end to the other as it takes to drive it. It goes nowhere useful. Christown Mall? Mill Ave with all it's empty storefronts? The cost of the fare, not even counting the subsidy, is more than the gas it would cost to drive this distance. The ticket machines are overcomplicated. It makes driving in central Phoenix a nightmare.If I could give it 0 stars, I would.   My review was flagged and removed by Yelp HQ once "because it lacks a first-hand experience of the business." Hey Yelp HQ nannies. I've ridden it a number of times, it sucks. And I pay for it every time I buy something whether I ride it or not because of the sales tax. And it makes left turns on Central Ave a pain in the ass. So if that doesn't constitute experience with the business, please tell me what does the next time you remove my review.   It's slow and a bad value, and it only is useful if you're going to go from a place within a few blocks, to a place within a few blocks. There is limited space for bicycles.   If time and money have no value to you, I guess that 5 stars makes sense. If you still think it's worth 5 stars, I want some of what you're smoking, because $1.75 for a service that costs $15 out of the pockets of others to provide.  Shocking.  If we bought each rider a brand new Prius III for $23,000 it would cost us just over $425 million, that is nearly ONE BILLION DOLLARS LESS than the $1.4 billion we pay to move them by rail, instead. 80% of ridership are former bus riders, so it hardly removes any cars from the road. Instead, it steals lanes, makes left turns dangerous and difficult, and makes traffic and congestion worse.  Just another example of crooked valley governments granting special favors to real estate developers, privatizing the profits and socializing the costs. Welcome to Phoenix. All aboard the Fail Rail!

I'm not really fan of the Fair Trade system. I want to like it since it's a market approach, but from an economics perspective, it actually harms growers.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_trade#Criticism  That said, I think coffee picked by child slave labor tastes best. The salt from their tears imparts that certain... je ne sais quios.  Not a bad coffee place. The baristas are cool. especially Geraldine who is also dangerous with a hula hoop, so better hope she is baristaing and not hula hooping, or you gonna git straight hooped, sucka. The coffee is tasty, they usually have a decent selection of tea, and their baked goods are fresh.  There is plenty of parking in the attached covered lot, and there's outdoor seating in both the front and back. The indoor seating is ample and comfortable. The tables and bathrooms are clean. It's downtown, and it's not Starbucks - IE the coffee is good and not burnt.  I'm a fan!

It had been a lot of years and I was thinking, you know, some questionable cow and fake horseradish sauce might just hit the spot.  Their signature roast beef sandwitch comes in 3 sizes: small, medium, and something approaching the size of your head.   I think my meal had enough salt in it to pay a Roman legion with, but since the legions today are paid in Federal Reserve fiat greenbacks, the salt goes to Arby's. Maybe I'll try it again after I time travel into the future a few years.

I like southwest. I fly them for business a lot - especially to California and other nearby states, though I've flown them to the east coast, too.   I don't care about unassigned seating. I always get an aisle seat. Just check in 24 hours early! Most people don't. You can even check in, not have a printer, then just pick up a boarding pass from the machine at the airport. I do that a lot for my return travel.   Their frequent flyer program is good, I fly on southwest for free, a LOT. I just earned another ticket this week. I think it's my 5th! I also get free drink coupons in the mail from them. I never use them all, and so on a flight I'll be on right before they expire, I'll bring all I have with me and be mr. popular in the area I'm sitting, because I got the other nearby passengers free drinks.  Anyway, what do you expect? All airlines are more or less the same. If you're going to want something to eat or drink on the plane, just pack it with you. Then you can have exactly what you want.   Southwest is a low priced carrier, but the seats are comfortable and the planes are clean. I mean, I get on the plane, sit in a chair for a few hours, and get off. I don't have too high of an expectation in terms of needing hosts/hostesses to fawn over you or smile or whatever. I just want to get there with my luggage, on time. They generally do that, are usually among the most reasonably priced, and their freq flyer program is great.  So I giver them a high rating!  About their freq flyer thing - when I book my hotel and rental car with it too, I can still use all my normal discount codes etc from membership in whatever, but also double dip on points!!! So - for example - I get say - Hilton points, Hertz points, AND Southwest miles - for booking it through the Southwest site. And the same price as booking directly. I don't know why Southwest doesn't advertise this? With the double dipping and frequent travel, I have been collecting points FAST since I figured this out recently.  Next personal trip - SF!

Best new spot to open in Cen Pho for ages.  The goat cheese app is amazing.  I ate the best (bone in!) pork chop on the planet. The polenta... perfect. The presentation, artful. My date ordered the chicken, hot and smoky. The chicken wasn't bad, either.  The bread is real bread, with a crust that one must chew and chew and chew. And chew. It was heaven.  The service and ambiance are so good, I forgot that I was still in AZ for just a few minutes.

I visited a couple times  two years ago and wasn't that impressed, and decided to give it one more shot a few weeks ago. I had a great experience, and visited again tonight.  Yay! I'm a fan.  I tend not to order rolls with crazy sauces, or anything with krab.   What I did have was knock-your-socks-off fresh and delicious.  Yellowtail sashimi, Mackeral sashimi, and not the marinated to death kind, either, scallop, raw shrimp (with the heads deep fried), salmon. All were super fresh and delicious.  On my previous visit, the hamachi kama and uni were both pretty amazing.  It's not the least expensive place for sushi in town, but the quality of the fish was very impressive.   Arigato!

I'm a Heeb, and my business partner is Palestinian. Hows' that for a combination?   One thing that we can always agree on is that they make the best hummus in town!  The hot Israeli waitresses are a plus, too.

Saturday Nights  Long time Phoenix house music scene innovators Pete 'Supermix' Salaz and Sean 'Senbad' Badger do a bad-ass Saturday night house music event called Solstice, upstairs on the roof area. It doesn't really get kicking until 10:30. If any of you have been around, you'll have heard of the infamous, long running Red Monkey and Chupa parties. These are the guys who made this stuff happen back in the day. I've never been there any other time.   What I'm saying is that if you are into house music, don't even bother going to Scottsdale. Now, Scottsdale is many things, and I like Scottsdale, but let's face it. House Music has soul. Downtown Phoenix has soul. Scottsdale? Not the most soulful place I can think of. If you're looking for the house music underground in AZ, you just found it. The crowd is pretty diverse for a club type event -  a mix of straight, gay, white, black, latino 20's and 30's, all smiling dancing together under the open sky on the roof. That may sound corny to the uninitiated, but if you're into house music... you know that's the real vibe.   I can say though that the food served downstairs is great, think upscale type bar food.  Logistics:  Parking  is problematic, because there's some douchebag club next door. It's downtown Phoenix and there are homeless people etc around. There's also a lot of foot traffic, so it's pretty safe. Still, if you don't want to drive around looking for somewhere to park, then don't - park across the street for $10. Your best way to get there is from Washington and 7th St since Washington is 1 way. Bar Smith will be on the right, parking on the Left.   Don't forget your dancing shoes! You could be a wallflower, but why?

On Thursdays, it's also a happening spot.   DJ's Mara and Brazilia take the decks upstairs and spin a mix of electro, funk, old school rap, and whatever. Mara is a short, cute, hispanic lesbian who has been rocking the decks in Phoenix since her days as a rave DJ in the early 90's. Brazilia is a tall, gorgeous Brazilian woman who knows how to rock a party and play to the crowd like few DJ's I've ever seen. Local electronic musicians often show up with their laptops and MIDI gear to perform mind-blowing, live, improvisational performances. It's much less crowded than Saturdays, but it brings an interesting crowd. You can actually have a conversation, unlike on Saturdays which is mostly wall to wall dancing people. Not that that's a bad thing.   Downstairs is hip-hop, which attracts a hypersexual, young ASU crowd. It's usually super crowded, and they're all grinding on each other with abandon before heading back to the dorms and contracting genital warts or who knows what.

I can't say enough about this place. I love to get lunch there, and leave with stuff to-go. They have some incredible home-made olives with different spices. I am an olive snob and can't say enough about them. You can also get hummus and baba ghanooj to go, as well as their freshly made (they are a bakery) pitas.  They also have some interesting mixes, canned beans, etc. They have a lot of Sadaf products which is cool because I used to actually mail order from them once in a while!   On the lunch side, I love all their vegetarian food and often get a vegetarian platter or falafel sandwich or plate, etc. Their tabouli is out of this world good - lots of fresh mint and parsley, lemon juice, it's perfect if you are into the Lebanese taste. I've never ordered meat there but I've seen other people order it and it looked great. The food is delicious and home made tasting. Their baklava is superb. Split some with your lunch mate.   If I were to succinctly describe their food it is fresh, healthy, authentic, and delicious.   I gave it 5 stars. Not 5 stars like a fine dining type restaurant - 5 stars because they do their type of ethnic food with unfailing perfection and authenticity and consistency across multiple visits.   Middle Eastern Bakery is keepin it REAL yo! ( blatant fishing for cool ratings!)

I feel bad for giving this chain location a good review, especially after displacing Emerald Lounge and Wings n Things.  That said.... it's down the block from my house, it's tasty and fresh, better than a couple local neighborhood non-chain places, and it's relatively healthy and fast. A good mix.

This is the Good Safeway. The Evil Safeway is at 7th st and McDowell.  Good Safeway: Clean Easy to find things Wide selection Fresh produce  Evil Safeway: Ghetto ass shit Wilted produce Limited selection Heroin addict park across the street It's been robbed during 2 shopping trips... wtf?  Only 4 stars though because a lot of the bakery goods have partially hydrogenated oil. WTF Safeway? Don't make me sic Lindsay on ur ass, yo.

I met my business partner here for breakfast the other day. It was his call - I'm glad we went.   I liked the multiple seating options a lot - side by side, small 2 person tables, larger tables, and outdoor seating, plus the coffee only side. Great layout and ambiance. Good place for an upscale type get together such as a business meeting or date.  I ordered the bagel and lox. Next time I will ask for the bagel to be toasted, but it was OK. I'm a bagel snob though, so don't take that too badly. The lox was great, and there was plenty of it.  Maybe too much for some people. It was very fresh and tasty, and the capers were a nice touch. It came with a generous bowl of fruit - a few kinds of melon, some strawberry, etc. Very fresh! As was the strong get-your-own-refill hot coffee.   I'll be back!

RIP - CLOSED FOREVER!  The cool illuminated disco floor was destroyed by a flying keg after the fire marshall showed up at 1:30 and shut it down a half hour before closing time.  Yes, I have a photo. :) (Added to the gallery above)  Faux Show is supposedly moving to a new location.

Mrs. White's is the biggety bomb!   I don't know how else to say it. I can't believe there was only one review so far. This place deserves better!  If you like southern aka food, this is the spot. It is 100% authentic.  My favorites - anything on the menu.  The collard greens are perfect.  The okra gumbo is perfect.  The fried chicken, plain or smothered (in gravy) are perfect.  The pork chops are perfect. Just don't tell my Rabbi I said that. ;)  The catfish is perfect. DOn't tell my Rabbi about that one, either, mmkay?  The cornbread is perfect.  The red beans and rice... perfect.  Starting to see a pattern here?  A few tips:  Get there early. They start to run out of stuff if you show up too late.  You can order a meal and then things by the piece. Like, order the catfish and a chicken thigh or something.   They don't have soda. They do have tea. Sweet tea (already sweetened - too sweet for me but very authentic southern) or unsweetened.  Order extra cornbread. It comes with the meal but you'll thank me.  If you don't have room for dessert, get it to go. The peach or whatever cobbler they have is kick ass, as is the bread pudding.  You will get seated and then order. They don't bring a bill to your table, you go up to the counter when you're done, tell them what you ordered, and pay there. That's why it's called the 'Mrs Whites Golden Rule.' Make sure to leave a good tip. They deserve it.  Being a regular will get you better service, but you aren't going there for the service. You're going there to eat.   There's a good chance you'll spot some Phoenix sports stars. I don't know who they are because I don't follow sports, but you can pretty much pick em out.  They are only open for lunch.   That's pretty much all you need to know. Bring your friends or coworkers, enjoy, and plan to endure a 3 hour food-induced coma when you're done.

Superb gelato - some of the best I've ever had! The guy behind the counter is the owner, and he takes pride in his gelato.  They only use real sugar, not high fructose corn syrup, and nothing contains hydrogenated oil.  I tasted a few flavors and settled on the coconut... it was sublime.   Definitely some of the best Gelato I have ever had. When I need a mid day sugar rush... I'll be back!

The service is good but the food.... Mediocre. Thai Lahna is a lot better. All the food is disturbingly sweet. I ordered some curry.... not a bowl of fucking froot loops. I thought Thai was supposed to be spicy?  The food is not authentic. I went once.... and won't be back.  The Green Curry at Pei Wei is better. How sad is that?

I love the 51 because, many years ago, I managed to lose a police helicopter that was following and tracking me with it's spotlight, in the middle of the night. I felt like James Fucking Bond 007. First of all because I have 0 respect for law enforcement officers and their Nazi-like "just following orders" arrests of people for victimless crimes, followed by locking them in government cages. Second of all, because I knew that the statistical chances of me ever being tailed by a Police helicopter and managing to lose it, at any time again in my entire life, approached 0. Third, because I spontaneously adapted an idea from an entirely different field.  Story time! Pull up a chair.  The setting: mid-late 1990's. Perhaps around 1996, 1997, when there was massive construction going on, on the 51. I lived downtown, on Roosevelt back then. Roosevelt then was NOTHING like it is now - most foot traffic was crack heads and transvestite hookers. But whatever, I'm from NY and I felt right at home. We're a tough breed.   I had spent the evening visiting some people who were friends at the time -  if you remember The Congo, after it turned into the first Internet coffee house ("cyber cafe") in the Valley - it was the couple that made that happen.  It was late at night. I was driving home, tired. I just wanted to get home and into bed, so I was speeding. A lot. Next thing I know, there are light flashing all over my car. I look behind me and see nothing. Roll down the window and look up, thinking I'm about to be abducted by aliens in a Betty and Barny Hill type scenario. Nope! Just the Popos! They had their spotlight on me and were ordering me to pull over on the megaphone.   First thought: Oh shit. I'm going to jail tonight. I had probably been smoking some high grade indoor sensimillia or something similar all evening. I know, dumb to do that and drive. I'm much more responsible now, so if you want to give me a hard time for being a dumbass at the age of 23, go right ahead and I'll probably agree with you - I was a with an outsized ego because I was... a computer programmer at the time. Sounds dorky but unless you've been in that world, you have no idea of the massively exaggerated sense of self worth a kick ass software developer can have. Now that I truly am that awesome, I look back and laugh. ;)  Anyway, I digress, Back to my police problem.  Brainstorm! Amazing what the chemically altered mind can come up with.   I've always had an interest in military tactics and strategy, even though I never joined any army. I'm a history buff, and it makes history come alive. Only I didn't learn this tactic by reading about ancient armies prepping the battle field, or reading about their troop formations, or reading one of my all time favorites, Sun Tzu. I learned it by watching the Robotech and Macross cartoons.   I remembered a tactic called Fokker's Feint, named after a German WWI flying ace. In a nutshell - you're being chased. You gain speed but then slow down rapidly, before your opponent in the dogfight has a chance to respond. He zooms past you, you get behind, and now he's in your gunsights.  Since my car wasn't equipped with heat seeking missile launchers, lasers, or other cool accessories, just a CD player, shooting it down wasn't really an option.   Instead, a plan came together. The best part was, I realized that if it failed, they'd have no idea of what I was trying to do, so I had nothing to lose. Go big or go home! Or in this case probably directly to jail, not passing go and not collecting $200.  At the time, the 51 was under construction Well, lucky for me, this construction involved a long stretch of the 51 that was just ahead of me having no street lights at all. Also, there was an exit coming up - if I recall correctly it was somewhere between Northern and Bethany Home.  I'm thinking Glendale, but as I mentioned, I wasn't exactly sober and this is going back a ways, so I don't recall.  Calculations going through my mind: I am going fast. (prob 90+). Helicopter going same speed. Tracked by helicopter with spotlight, which uses my headlights to tell where I am. Street lights which illuminate the freeway - off. I have one chance to do this right.  I sped up another 15 MPH so I was going past 100. Helicopter speeds up to follow, megaphone guy goes nuts, telling me to pull over. Then.... as I approach the freeway exit.... I turn off the car headlights, slam on the brakes, and pull off the exit. I watch as the helicopter zooms right past me, down the freeway. It then starts circling the freeway to figure out where I went - I watched, parked with my lights out in a parking lot right off the freeway.   My windows were rolled down and I'm pretty sure I heard helicopter guy drop the F bomb over the megaphone. I waited for the flying pigs to leave, then took city streets the rest of the way home, careful to drive the speed limit and obey all traffic laws.   Whew.

Wow.... has this corner of Sunnyslope changed!  10 years ago I worked in an office building across the street, at an Internet startup. The day we moved in, there was a double homicide at the Circle K on Dunlap and Central. After that, I brought my baseball bat to work every day, because I usually didn't leave until late at night when crack zombies congregated in the parking garage below the building. I called it  "Louis," my coworker called it (very Un-PC) the Ethnic Cleanser.   Now.... the ghetto elements are gone, and there is a wonderful wine bar with an even better patio.  We put down a bottle of the Rose - it was very, very tasty and drinkable. We went on a Sunday, all they serve then is their breakfast menu. Well... it rocked. I had the veggie and cheese omelette, my guest had the chorizo wrap. Both were superb! The service was attentive, the ambiance was awesome both indoors and outdoors. The patio is shaded by some giant mesquites, with comfortable couch and chair seating.   I'll be back! Especially for the goat and sheep cheese plate, and to try some of the rest of their fantastic wine selection. Ole!

Fail.  They serve food till midnight, so we rolled through here at 11 PM on a First Friday.   The waiter kept forgetting things we asked for... water, menus, etc.   French fries - oops chips - tasted like they had been sitting out for a while. Cool and mushy... not my idea of a good chip.  My clam chowder was kind of thin though it tasted OK. It was lacking potatoes. Kinda weird.   Ordered a Strongbow cider on tap... and it's flat. Since the server was nowhere to be found, I went up to the bar. Bartender: "Oh the cider is usually a little flat! Don't worry about it!" (WHAAA???) Me: "No - it's really flat. I think my water is fizzier." Turns out it was the bottom of the tap and there's none left, and they aren't opening another till the next day. So no drinkey drinkey for Adam. Fail!   Friend ordered some sandwich, she seemed to like it but it didn't look too thrilling to me. So whatevs.  The wine list was pretty shallow. Other friend ordered some "fruity tart" type flavored white wine. She said it was "tinny" tasting and not good. Fail.  The pool table takes up way too much room such that it's impossible to sit around the wall and not be poked by sticks. After being poked 3x by this daft fool I tapped the back of his cue ball and messed up his shot on purpose, because I was about to get it in the ribs.   The paintings of the Queen and Churchill kind of suck, in a 7th grade kind of way. It looks like Queen E's hair is floating slightly above her head.   I will not be back!

They sell a stimulant from South America and are called "Cartel."  A joke's hiding in there, somewhere.   Stopped by for the first time today. It wasn't easy to find, but that made it fun.  (Look in the BACK of the shopping center). I'm sure it's easy to miss!  All I have to say about my visit is... DAMN these guys serve a great cuppa joe. One of the best I've had. Ever.

Sundays are now "Recovery Sundays" at Canvas, hosted by Tiffe Fermnaint... Enter the parking lot through the alley accessible on 3rd st., right behind Canvas. The party is in the back and in the alley just to the East of the building.   The party starts @ 7PM. Expect a lounge type atmosphere, music, and a bunch of downtown hipster types "Recovering" from a weekend of dancing and debauchery.... with more dancing and debauchery. BYOB.  What could possibly go wrong?

So... this is the only reason to go to Cripstown, I mean Christown. What a shithole ghetto ass excuse for a mall, it's even more ghetto than Metro Center.   On the other hand, Costco rulez.  Their 'store brand' of Kirkland products are super high quality, ad priced low. My dogs love their dogfood. I love their butcher and seafood section, and there is always a great selection of very reasonably priced fresh produce. They have great prices on a limited selection of DVD and Blu Ray disks. They have a great wine and liquor selection, with excellent prices. Eyeglasses. Clothing, Towels. Beds. BBQs. Bicycles. Pharmacy. Car tires. Electronics. If you are a member, you can go to any Costco, and they pretty much are all the same.   As for this location.... despite being in Cripstown, it's great. The only downside is that the area that sells ready to eat pizza, hot dogs, etc is facing the mall... meaning all the ghetto ass motherfuckers who aren't Costco members share my oxygen while on line. I wish they would charge non members more for the food items, or have a members only line. Oh well.  Recommendation - park in the BACK parking lot, off Montebello, not on the Bethany Home side which is full of mall goers.

Never been in - but I get pizza delivered from them now and then. I am a New Yorker and to call me a pizza snob probably doesn't go far enough.  The crust is crispy, thin, and foldable, the outside edges, crispy and bubbly. Great mozzarella. I have never been disappointed by a topping. A little greasy, as it should be; it reminds me of NY pizza, and that's a big compliment coming from me.  We don't have a Ray's in Central Phoenix... but we do have Mamma Mia's.   Yo! Tony! You make a good pizza.

OLIVES!!!!!  I am an olive snob. Olives in cans make me depressed. No joke. How anyone could abuse an olive by putting it in a can... shiver. Forget waterboarding. That shit is torture!  The olive bar is the best anywhere. They have about 20 different varieties. My office is now in the office park right behind Whole Foods, so I can walk there and eat some of the best olives I've ever had, whenever I head up there instead of working at home. Wow. My mouth is smiling. I just got back. The citrus stuffed olives were great. I love the wrinkly black dried olives. The cracked olives are fantastic. The giant kalamata's are incredible. The picholines are tiny and tasty. I wasn't kidding when I said I was an olive snob.  Oh, the rest of the store looks cool, too, I guess.

I live down the block from here, and ordered a pizza from there once. The owner delivered it himself and we chatted for a few minutes.   The pizza - I've had better. The crust was kind of under cooked and there wasn't much cheese on it. I know this sounds silly, but the Large was both not great and too small! :) What I mean is that the quality and size  should have both been better. I'm from NY, so I know what a pizza is supposed to be like. Pizza a Metro? Fuhgeddaboutit.  I'm laying off those kind of carbs for now, so I won't be trying the other dishes any time soon.

Just visited for the first time - previously I had ordered delivery.  Pretty cool! Nice little neighborhood Italian place, small and cramped, reminded me of New York a bit.  The Antipasto was a mixed bag. The mozzarella, salami, prosciutto, peppers, were great. The eggplant and mushrooms, less so. The bread - delicious! The olives were the terrible sliced canned variety. The proprietor said he is going to make his own from his olive tree - that should be better! In the meanwhile guys - a few good olives are better than a lot of shitty canned ones. I'm just sayin'. I wish they had some decent tomatoes, also.  Pasta was superb. I had the lasagna - it was fantastic. She had the special, some kind of linguine thing in white sauce with shrimp. It came with 4 giant shrimp. I felt like it could have had a few more, for the price, but that's just me! The flavor was great.  I brought a bottle of wine, the corkage fee was $5. Very nice.  They gave us a cannoli, on the house, as a dessert! It was superb. My friend, an ex-pastry chef, was impressed. I am from NY and was impressed. Good stuff. Yum!  I will be back! Nice little neighborhood spot, for sure!  They are going to stay open, longer - 9:30 during the week, open at 4 and close at 10 on the weekends, yay!

Not sure about the expensive comment in another review?  Men's shirts are $2.40 each according to my most recent bill... and they do free pickup and delivery... AND they are open till 8 pm.   They do a great job... My shirts are super clean and beautifully pressed. Even the shirts with french cuffs. They do it in house... not farm it out to somewhere else. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable.   Pretty awesome!

Bland, uninspired, mushy.  I had 2 fish and 1 bean taco. The beans were good - the rest of the tacos, not so much! They were kind of slopped together. No fountain drinks - cans and bottles only. So much for being eco-friendly hippies.

It's a nice park on the water. We don't have a lot of these in AZ!   There are 5 miles of multi-use (bike, walk, run, rollerblade, whatever) paths. You can reserve a picnic table, rent a boat, spash in this water thingy during warm months, and take a nice walk. It's a fun place to go kill a few hours, it's free, and it's close to Mill Ave. Kind of hard to go wrong!

How the hell can this place be sitting on top of a Pei Wei and a Starbucks?  It's a hip, urban lounge. Spacious, lots of comfy seating including a wall hugging couch seat thingymabob. Kind of a modern take on a 70's era lounge, without the ferns but with the mood lighting. They mix a damn good drink - especially their Margaritas, which are made with a home made mix, not the neon green shit from a bottle.   The music is aways downtempo. The mood is chill. I've only gone with friends so far, but could see it making a good stop on a date. It's def the kind of place where you want to BYOC (bring your own company) because there isn't much of a social atmosphere. But for a fun, classy place to go with friends, it's awesome. Once you're feeling sauced up, head down the way to Bikini Lounge and cause some ruckus.

I was there just last night, and today received a ROTD for my original review. Too weird.  Updates - They mix a great margarita! No fluorescent green pre mixed Margarita mix - they make it themselves with fresh lime juice. Yum.  The wine list is small but good. My current fave is the Argentinian Malbec.  It's only $6 a glass, and they pour generously. Very tasty wine.  The seating is not comfy if you like to slouch. If you sit up straight, it's fine. But seriously.... good posture is over rated.  It gets a little cold in there once in a while during the winter. Wear long sleeves. :) After 3 glasses of the Malbec last night, I didn't care.  This place has really been growing on me... nice to have such a great neighborhood watering hole!

The Phoenician fucking rocks, OK?  The city view is ++. Serious. If I had taken a date there instead of going with a client, I totally would have gotten some ass.  Service - great. Wine - great. I bet the cocktails are, too, but I didn't have one. I did have the $38 per person seafood appetizer which is pretty much a meal on it's own - a lobster tail, some clams, oysters, mussels... good stuff, and with 4 sauces, not 3, not 5. 4. There will be a test later. Only downside, it tasted like the seafood had been prepared then refrigerated. For $38 per person for an appetizer, motherfuckers, youse betta make dat shit fresh homie. Don't give me no chicken of the sea buuuuuulllllllll shit! OK maybe that's a little over the top. It could have been better, but it wasn't horrid.   The side dishes were tasty. I had the steak frite, a hangar steak with fries, kinda frenchie style and shit, cuz I gots class yo. The quality of the beef was high, it was very tender, the chef understood what "Medium Rare" means, it was like quality and skill in preparation came together to make a perfect steak, om nom nom. The fries though kind of had a frozen safeway brand quality to them. How do you fuck up french fries? One of the other dinner attendees had the filet, which looked tender and juicy and perfectly cooked, and I have to say the salmon was beautiful and translucent and perfect looking, enough so that I was actually impressed. The sides were A OK. We didn't have any creamed sides - just the normal variety.   The food is good but the ambiance is better. I hate writing that. it's still 4 stars.  The best seating is by the window, no doubt. I saw some douchetard there with his lady, sitting by the window - facing AWAY from it. Yo homie! No ass for you, you're doing it wrong.

This McDonalds has been here forever, at the corner of 7th Ave/Van Buren/Grand Ave. I stopped in for lunch today while walking home from an appointment. I figured... I haven't eaten Mickey D's in ages, why not? Plus, I'm walking, and it's a... scenic area.  I was impressed by the cleanliness, especially given the sad state of most of the customers and employees. I think it's mecca for tattooed gangbangers.  2 stars instead of 1 because they have Diet Dr Pepper on tap. Oh yeah.  I had a double quarter pounder with cheese and fries. The fries were luke warm. The burger tasted institutional - think public school cafeteria.   I imagine it might be a really entertaining place to stop by on a weekend evening, what with the hookers and hoes hotels nearby with their $20-something rooms and whatnot.   Next time I'm in the 'hoooooood and want fast food, I'm hitting Church's Chicken across the street.

It is just like the other location, but I like the patio a little better. It's bigger and more open.  The food and wine are great - just like the other location.   I am going to spend a lot of quality time here.

I ordered a teriyaki bowl, to go. 20 minutes later, I was still waiting. Some people who came in after me had already been served - with the same dish I ordered. Two people who ordered before me hadn't been served yet, either. The cashier didn't even offer an apology when I asked for a refund. She seemed to be on some hell of a drug, or perhaps practicing astral travel while taking orders.  Pretty awesome.

No Pop! Champagne, but we did put down a bottle of a very tasty Zinfandel from Lodi, CA.   Cheese plate... Yum.  I had the goat cheese salad. It was superb.  She had some kind of crepe. It was very yummy.  I didn't go inside once. I have too much testosterone. We sat out on the patio and it was very nice, even in the heat, due to the misters. That's kind of funny. The matrons of Scottsdale sit inside, away from the misters.   Everything was fresh, tasty, well prepared, artfully plated, and the service was very good. Hard to go wrong! It's a great place for exquisite food and stimulating conversation, lubricated by a bottle of wine.
