I'm confused as to how this place is getting great written reviews but only four stars. What do yall want, little dancing chilis with your meal? This is some of the best Mexican food in a rather wide radius. It's not typical when compared with a lot of the fake bs Mexican restaurants we have. The only way it can be construed as typical is that it's real. If you want something beyond that (which would completely ruin it) then this isn't your place. If you want the good stuff at good prices, don't miss this place.

The food here is just not good. Not that it's particularly bad, but there is much better available nearby. It's bland in the way that wholly Americanized Mexican food always is, and the ambience of the place isn't really appealing either. The people who only wanted chips and drinks looked like they were having fun, but I can't speak from experience on that. The view of the lake is kind of novel in this area, but you're really only looking out over a big pond at some apartments, which gets boring very quickly. In short, I'm not really sure why anyone would want to go here, I'm pretty certain that regardless of what you're looking for, you could easily find better nearby.

This is, as far as I'm aware, THE casual Italian place in Chandler. There's been more than one occasion where myself and a group of friends can't decide what to eat, and have gone here by default. We all get calzones (which are a bit greasy, my only complaint), which are always huge and hot. There are plenty of choice for the stuffing, so everyone gets something they like. They've just expanded to add a new dining area, which was good since before we'd occasionally have to wait (gasp!) for a few minutes to seated. So no, don't go here if you want fine wine and fancy Italian dining. But do go here otherwise.

Caveat: I don't drink coffee (gasp!) so I'll be commenting on every aspect but that. Read other reviews if you want to know how the coffee is.  The biggest selling point of this place is that it's open late. Yes it has free wifi, but forgive me for being underwhelmed, considering that pretty much every coffee shop that doesn't have a green logo does. Even then, their obnoxious password system resulted in problems getting the wifi working on my iPhone. The indoor seating arrangement is odd, which has left me feeling uncomfortable if I don't get one of the few seats I like. The outdoor seating is nice, but you won't last long in the evening if you dislike smoke nor in the day if you dislike ducks. Some fools who go here see fit to feed the ducks, which during the day results in ducks coming to you begging for food and crapping nearing your feet. And god help you if you kick them way, you'll have to suffer the disdainful looks of the high school girls who often congregate here. The various non-coffee/tea drinks I've tried aren't good. They're usually just a blend of ice, some sort of syrup or soda, and (depending on what you order) milk. A little fresh fruit, or frozen fruit, or any sort of 'real' ingredient, would go a long way. Instead they seem concerned with making these drinks as cheaply as possible. The baklava I only tried once, since it tasted like it had been sitting out way too long. It's possible I just had some on a bad day, but I won't be ordering it again unless I'm really craving baklava. Most of the baristas are friendly, but a couple are real pr*cks who will wipe the smile off your face if you interact with them. I've also been harassed about ordering quickly, even in situations where the place is relatively empty. Sorry if I don't want to order and have my ice melt before the rest of my friends arrive!  As I said, the primary draws of this place is that it's open late and (for indie types) that it's not Starbucks. But as far as I'm concerned, that doesn't excuse the crappy non-coffee drinks and occasional unfriendliness I've experienced.

Whenever I go here I feel like everyone knows a secret about this place that I don't. The food isn't Asian in any meaningful sense, and it isn't particularly good in general. So why is it packed out and the dishes so relatively expensive? I just had the new Lemongrass Prawn, which was pretty good as far as that goes, but not even remotely Chinese. The fake Asian decorations are more annoying to me than anything, and the dim ambience is destroyed by the TVs playing at the bar since they can be seen from just about every table in the restaurant. The general pretense of classiness was ruined for me when I went to the bathroom only to find spanish profanities written all over the stall. Someone in my party was served the wrong dish, and it took a while for us to get the right one. We were mistakenly given an appetizer which we had not ordered. Clearly, the serving system is incapable of handling a full restaurant. I also saw people being moved to different tables to make way for other, larger parties. I understand the business sense, but that's a completely classless move. Our server was very friendly, but rushed us out as soon as we were done eating. Bland food, poor service, long waits, and high prices? I'll pass.

If you want disgusting food, it can be had much more cheaply. Or for free, out of a trash bin. I suppose if you're only eating once in a while and need to stuff yourself when you do then this place is passable. Personally, I'd rather skip a meal than go here. And yes, American buffets are infamously bad, but even so this place is terrible, and rather dirty. You're better off going into [whatever supermarket is in that plaza now] and buying some food there.

Five stars for a fast food place? Hell yea. This is pretty much the only fast food place (other than In-N-Out) that people actually like instead of eating at strictly for convenience. (That said, it's still fast food.) You can either drive thru, order in your car, or eat outside on picnic style tables. The kids meals make for a great snack (who doesn't like a free toy?) and the coneys are ahead of their time as far as AZ is concerned. The real killer, of course, is the huge variety of drinks, slushies, etc. If you go during happy hour you can get a whole crowd of people large drinks for just a couple of bucks. Don't go expecting fantastic food, but do go in lieu of just about any other fast food place.

The atmosphere and staff are really great here. It's rather cozy without feeling cramped, although I've never been here while it's been crowded. The food here is quite good as far as Chandler goes, but you could get better and more at the same price elsewhere if you were willing to drive a little. Although I don't see why the cash only policy would actually deter someone from going, it is rather surprising for a place as nice as this. The salsa bar is very well stocked, and is probably the best reason to eat here. I've never drank here, but the bar always looks nice and moderately busy, if a bit small.

One of the original grimy and dirty psuedo-mex sort of places - and I mean "grimy and dirty" in the best way possible. It's not texmex, but not really real mexican food. Neither the menu choice nor the food itself are particularly good, but if you're looking for a good, say, bean and cheese burrito, this is a solid choice. And they serve Pepsi products, always a bonus for those of who like Dew. If you're looking for something a bit nicer, Guedo's is a block south and is significantly nicer to sit down and eat at. They also have much better food and a bar - but are almost double the price. I may have a positive bias for this place, considering the many times I ate there during my HS days, but any mexican food fan in Chandler needs to eat here at least once.

When it comes to sandwiches, it doesn't get much better than this without going much further and paying much more. The food is ridiculously cheap, but you wouldn't know that just from eating it - you'd have to go to the establishment itself, where the various cost saving measures become obvious. The ambience is non-existent (you might as well be sitting in the middle of a supermarket eating), but it's clean and quick. As others have said, the baguettes are absolutely delicious, but the drink, meats, and vegetables are wonderful as well. Unless you're adamantly opposed to sandwiches, meat, or a plain atmosphere you're going to at least like this place.

My review is based on a weekday lunch, so my experience is necessarily different than the after dinner drinks crowd.  The best thing about this place was the Coke. Aging clientele, utterly bland food, lackluster service, and tacky decor all combine to make this one experience I won't be in a hurry to repeat any time soon. There are so many better options nearby, starting with the downtown Chandler/San Marcos complex.

I honestly don't know how these guys can afford to compete against The Internet and WalMart et al, but they do. Probably by having cool staff, an eclectic collection (for a store this size), and a few other goodies that appeal to music lovers. You don't have to be ideologically driven to enjoy this place, and I've happily killed plenty of time just browsing through things. Sometimes special events happen in store (although that's more true of the other location), so talk with staff to keep up on whats up. If you have old CDs or records lying around, drop by to look around a get a few bucks out of your visit.

I think the five stars reviews must people from people who have never had boba elsewhere before, and have conflated the lovely drink with this particular establishment in their reviews. The boba itself is usually fairly good here, at least most of the time, but this it's not very welcoming. The staff is either friendly or uncaring/weird, depending on who you are - and if you're not friends with them from elsewhere it'll almost certainly be the latter. Service is rather bad, you're likely to be mischarged (check your receipt!), given the wrong thing, or you'll end up waiting forever for your drink. Most of the magazines are Asian, so unless you read then you won't enjoy those, and the games are frequently missing pieces. The computers are almost always occupied and if you go in the evening you're likely to run into annoyingly loud groups of kids.  Go a mile west and get a sandwich + boba at Lee's or just get boba at Boba House.  And to the dude who is impressed by all of the "real live Asian people", seriously? Do you also judge mexican food places by how many mexicans are eating there? Or maybe you were just unaware that "real Asians" existed in Arizona? Stop being (or at least sounding) so ignorant.

The Thai place in the area.  I really enjoy the general feel of the place, the staff is very friendly and the remodeled facade makes it appear much classier. The color and lighting are a nice balance of light and dark, giving the restaurant a comfortable, private aura without appearing cramped or dim. While the dress code is casual, I'd feel perfectly comfortable coming here on somewhat dressy occasions. I've eaten here many times and have never disliked the food. Portions are generous while prices are low. Unlike many other places I've been to, medium here actually is moderately spicy instead of "just short of our absolute spiciest". The meat is always delicious whatever form you're eating it in, and the curries are spectacular. Don't forget to get some Thai iced tea with your food!

This place serves fantastic sushi. I've tried nearly ten different kinds at this point, and have always been delighted. It's rarely crowded, has lovely outdoor seating, and some of the best and friendliest waiters I've ever encountered. I wouldn't take more than about four or five people here as it isn't that big, but it's very well decorated and the many windows make it feel comfortably spacious. The sushi selection is quite wide, so it's easy to find something you're certain to like, and the appetizers are cheap and delicious. If they were in a more expensive location I'm sure they could charge much more, so enjoy the relatively cheap prices! If you become a regular you'll be recognized and extra-welcome, which is good since if you like sushi you'll end up going back often.

Major points for having one of the most wicked cool ambiences of any hang out sort of place I've ever been in. Very cool. Major deductions for crappy service, drink purchasing requirements (and frequently being out of the drink you order), and rules limiting when you can sit in the balcony area. The sheesha itself has been of varying quality. If you want hookah, you're better off going to Tempe instead.
