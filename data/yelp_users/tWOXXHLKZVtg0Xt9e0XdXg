I love this place. The embiance is a cross between laid back and classy. Great wine and LOVE their bruchetta!  This is a great place relax and enjoy an evening or an afternoon.

This place is great! It has a large lounge area, with spacious private dining rooms and an enormous patio that faces the quaint small shops of Old Town Scottsdale.  The atmosphere is warm and weloming and the staff are very helpful.

I stopped here with some friends here on Saturday night because we were told they have the best cocktails. Im all for paying extra for good quality drinks. I bought a round for a friend of mine which was 2 Moscow Mules & a sparkling water. When I got my tab I was completely dumbfounded. The sparkling water was $15! FIFTEEN DOLLARS FOR WATER!!!! Never in my life have I paid that much for water. And if I ever was to pay that much, I best be sipping it on a cliff off a coast with incredible scenery, not some 1000+ sq ft bar in Old town. And to top it off, both my friend and I were not impressed with the Moscow Mules.

Great new concept. Fast food set up with a menu larger than all other fast food joints. My friend ordered a burger and I ordered the Buffalo chicken wrap. This place does not disappoint.
