This is a really cool place for kids to learn and not bad for adults either! We've already been twice this year, my son loves all the interactive stuff they have. There's a pretty cool section on the 4th floor (you have to take the elevator) we missed it the first time around, I recommend grabbing a map so you don't miss anything!  Best time to come is the middle of the week, if you're able, weekends get pretty busy and makes it hard to get around to everything. IMAX and the special exhibits are an extra cost.   I've noticed Groupon has discounts available regularly, that's usually when we go, saves a bit of $$ so make sure to check for deals before heading that way!

My favorite Mexican food restaurant. There is one in Goodyear as well but I actually drive out of my way to come to this location (food is better here for some reason). I usually always get the cheese enchilada meal and its always amazing, chips and salsa are so good too (and rather addicting!).   Always look forward to eating here :)

As far as fast food goes they do well; never a long wait, employees are friendly, and orders are correct.

Haven't been here in a long time, a lot of new options to choose from!   They were super busy when we came in but they were working fast and the employees were very friendly.  Will keep in mind for future ice cream outings :)

AWESOME! I took my 6 year old son and he loved it! We came Sunday afternoon and it wasn't very busy at all which was so nice, we got to see everything and not feel rushed or crowded. He already wants to go back. I think the dinosaurs were the highlight of this museum, really amazing :)   Prices are very resonable as well. I think it was only $10 for an adult and $6 for a child.

Came here about 8:30 pm on a Monday night, not particularly busy. I used the drive thru and ordered a footlong coney and a hamburger with only ketchup and pickles (my son is very particular) as well as two drinks. It took way too long for them to come out to the car to collect the money and bring the food, so long I was about to drive away.  After I got home with the food I discovered the only thing they got right was the drinks. I received one regular size hotdog and a hamburger with EVERYTHING on it.

We (my boyfriend, son, & I) came here to grab some dinner, we wanted to try something new. I got the chicken teriyaki bowl without cabbage, my son got a kids meal BBQ chicken, and my boyfriend got the spam and eggs combo; it was outrageously expensive for the quantity/quality of food you get. The kids meal alone was over $5.50 and it doesn't even include a drink! My chicken had a lot of fat on it but the rice and chicken that wasn't fatty was very good. My son hardly ate any of his meal because the macaroni salad wasn't any good and the rice was burnt and my boyfriend agreed it didn't taste good. I don't think we will be coming back here again, wasn't worth the money. The restaurant also needs a remodel very badly, very run down and dirty.

As far as fast food goes this place does it right!   Never have issues with drive thru orders and the few times I've been inside the employees have always been very friendly.   Today in the drive thru we had Tayler (at least that's what the receipt says) she was very nice and took the time to be friendly and ask if we needed any condiments even though you could tell she was very busy taking orders and cashing out customers.   Way to go, Whataburger!

I haven't been here in quite a while but my husband and I came in for lunch last Thursday afternoon. They have a new lunch menu (new to me at least) it's called the Fast Break Lunch and they actually had some pretty decent lunch deals on there, you can also upgrade the size for an additional charge. We ordered a side of fried pickles as an appetizer and they came out super fast! My husband loves the fried pickles and when we first ordered them I was a bit skeptical but they're awesome and we get them every time we come here now! For my meal I ordered the Snack Boneless Wings with the garden salad, it came with about 8 boneless wings which is plenty for me but like I said if that's not enough you can upgrade to the small for $1.50 more. The salad was fresh and the wings came out hot, everything tasted really good. Our server came by several times to make sure everything was tasting good and they have someone called a Captain that came by our table to offer sauce sampling, which is a cool idea we just didn't take advantage of it this time.

I love coming here, food is really good and staff is friendly. Usually fast service every time I'm here which is nice considering they're almost always busy. Only complaint is that I feel they charge a lot for the amount you get, my boyfriend got a sandwich and it didn't come with chips or potato salad or anything and it was $8 or $9, kinda ridiculous. I usually just get the bread boule with soup and I think that's fairly priced but drinks are expensive too.

Awful service and such a slow drive thru.  Not coming back.  Ordered a smoothie and they let me order, pay, and wait at the other window until they figured out they don't have any...  I sat at the drive thru window several minutes before someone even opened it and acknowledged me and there was a line behind me!  They definitely don't move with much purpose.

This store is down the street from my house so it's somewhat convenient but I can never find any workers! It drives me crazy. I never come here on the weekends or around holidays anymore it's too crazy!

I really enjoyed this, I also went by myself since it was on my way back from working out of town. I love learning new things and I found this very interesting but you definitely have to be into history to enjoy it. Only $5 and that includes a short film about the ruins and a tour, both optional to attend. I wouldn't bring my 6 year old here, he would either be bored out of his mind or want to climb all over the ruins. Gift shop is expensive just like any gift shop, nothing out of the ordinary.

We drive a little farther to come to this theater, but the drive is worth it, the theater is always clean and the employees are very friendly.   We received a Harkins loyalty  shirt and drink cups for Christmas so we always bring those with us when we see a movie, free popcorn with the shirt and $1.50 refills with the cups, it's a great deal!  Can't wait for the location in Goodyear to open!

I love this theater, I always come to this one even though its not the closest one to me. Friendly staff and they keep it CLEAN! Plus I don't feel like its a high school playground on the weekends. As far as pricing goes tickets are decently priced and they have deals for weekdays before a certain time and weekends before noon. I smuggle in candy so can't help with those prices but I know they're ridiculous like every other theater.

I love Sprouts, I come here about once a week but try to avoid weekends as it gets very crowded! Wednesdays are double ad Wednesdays, so both weeks sale prices are in effect, good deal!  They always have a great selection of produce and fair prices. The employees are always very friendly, especially the cashiers!   If you bring your own reusable bag you get a 5 cent discount per bag ;)

The food here was amazing!  I can honestly say that this was the best meal I've had from a restaurant, ever!  We were here for a reception meal for a wedding; served Caesar salad, shrimp appetizer, filet mignon (my son had the chicken, also amazing), and a dessert (have no idea what it was but it was good).  I don't come to Vegas frequently but would definitely recommend coming here!

Love it here! Best bar at Westgate!  I'm not usually the bar going type but I really enjoy this particular one and I don't feel like people are bumpin' and grindin' all over the place (uncomfortable!). Came here with some friends last weekend and we all had a great time and its enjoyable for the designated driver as well ;)

This place is awful, ALWAYS! I have never had a good experience unless I'm just grabbing a soda in the drive thru. We've come here a few times for breakfast and the sandwiches are usually burnt. I have a six year old who loves happy meals but he doesn't like fries and they always give us fries instead of apples that I ordered with his meal. It wouldn't be as bad if they could just get the orders correct without us having to fix it for them. So frustrating.

Came in here Easter Sunday for a quiet place to have lunch, it wasn't busy and this was our first time visiting so we had a chance to browse the menu a bit and see what they had to offer.  We ordered an Italian Hero, Sausage Breakfast Burrito and a BLT. Everything was made very well and had absolutely no complaints! Before we left we ordered a half a dozen donuts (but I was hoping to get a cupcake, didn't see any available!).  It's a very cute little place to eat, could use a little TLC as new paint is needed in the seating area but overall very clean. Four stars, food was great but bakery selection was low, may have just came in at the wrong time. Will definitely visit again, I still want a cupcake!

Came here tonight with my boyfriend without the little one and we had a great time! Our server Jason was very friendly and was a very efficient worker, when we were seated he was at our table within minutes to take our drink orders. The restaurant was of course busy, it being a Friday night, but the staff all worked together very well and you could see they all worked as a team serving their customers. Our food orders were perfect and absolutely no complaints! We look forward to coming back soon and we are definitely happy with the performance of the Yard House team tonight!

A lot more expensive than I had remembered but the food was good.   I came here with my son and my mom, my son and I shared the parmesan crusted tilapia with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli and my mom had the coconut shrimp appetizer. My son is six and he really liked the fish and LOVED the complementary biscuits. Our server even gave him a free kids drink since we knew he wouldn't eat the full kids meal and didn't want to waste my money.  Overall it was a really great experience, the food and service was very good. Prices just a tad scary when you're bringing kids along! My plate was around the $15 range but I'm glad I decided to split it with my son because there is no way I would have finished it.

This was my first time here, easy to find and lots of parking available.   I was greeted when I entered and was able to order right away (I came around 1pm on a weekday) I did check out the menu online before coming in so I already knew what I wanted. I got my order to go and probably waited about 5 minutes, they had two or so orders ahead of mine. The price was a bit more than I had anticipated, I'm not sure if the menu prices are different from what was online but I got the Gyro Sandwich combo with the Greek salad instead of fries and it was about $10. I did receive a lot of food and it was really fresh, definitely no complaints :)  I can't wait to come back and I think I'll drag my husband along too!   BTW they offer Pepsi products, in case you are particular but they do have iced tea as well.

This is my go to place for pedicures! They work quickly and do a good job. Only complaint is the last time I went in I had to get a full set of the fake nails for a wedding and she cut up my fingers a lot more than I would have liked. Pretty painful when they start putting the nails on and cut up cuticals don't really look that great. Pedicure was awesome though and still no chips in the paint, which was put on almost 2 weeks ago.

This was my first visit here, we had guests from out of town and this was a favorite for one of them so we figured we would try it. I was surprised by how expensive it was, I guess I was expecting something different. I ended up having the spicy chicken wrap ( I think that's what it was called) and when it came to the table it was huge!! So the portion sizes are definitely more than generous but I wasn't impressed with the taste. I thought it was pretty bland for supposedly being a spicy dish. Not something I would order again.

I'm not sure why we haven't been here before, we live so close and drive by almost everyday but we did decide to give it a go this morning!  I think we were the first ones in there this morning right around 10:30 when they opened for lunch. We decided to go for the lunch specials, they had 8 options, and they were all very reasonably priced! (Specials all week from 10:30-4) My husband and I got the two slices and a drink special and our son got one slice and a drink, total amount paid was around $11! I just got the plain cheese pizza, my husband and son got the pepperoni and we all loved it, I couldn't finish my second slice so next time I'll just be getting the single slice deal!   The restaurant itself was very clean and well kept. There's a pretty decent amount of seating space inside too. The employees we encountered were all very friendly, especially the girl at the register. We also love to come back to a place with great service!

Came in yesterday afternoon, there was no wait but they were somewhat busy. Our server was with us within a few minutes and took our drink order, she got the drinks right but couldn't remember who ordered what. When we were ready to order she never asked how we wanted to burgers cooked and I found that kind of odd, since the times we've been here before the server has asked.  I can't remember the name exactly but I ordered a BBQ whisky something burger; it comes with fried onions, BBQ sauce, mayo, lettuce, tomato and cheese. I usually order this one when I come in but it was just terrible this time around. There was hardly any BBQ sauce, the onions were burnt, my hamburger patty was split in half and kept falling out of my bun. I ate about half and gave up on it.  They have the tablets at the tables now to pay your bill but our server never told us we can pay whenever we are ready. We wanted a box for my sons food and didn't see her for quite some time. Refills were scare and it just wasn't the experience we expected, we've had great experiences here before. After leaving my husband said he also wasn't impressed and that the food was lacking. If we're going to spend $50 eating out this isn't the experience we expect to have, I've made better hamburgers at home.

Horrible customer service, went in looking for a specific pair of shoes I needed for a wedding and no one greeted me or acknowledged me at all. After I found the shoes on my own I went to check out and there was a woman already checking out and then another customer was waiting behind me and the other cashier rang them up first when I was clearly the next customer. Both cashiers were unprofessional, talking to each other the entire checkout process and never once said hi or looked at me. I'll never shop here again.

We used to come here regularly but the past few times haven't been that great, I think I may be looking for a new spot to get my enchilada fix!  This particular visit my husband and I decided to share the Adobada pizza (I usually get enchiladas if you haven't guessed that already). The pizza was ok, I wasn't thoroughly impressed, it tasted like something I would buy frozen and cook at home to be honest. My husband enjoyed it though.   They used to have .99 margaritas, they're now $1.99 so that's a bit disappointing too :( that was one of the reasons we used to come here so frequently.   The service is mediocre, the server we had this past visit just didn't want to be there. We had drinks when we needed them but we didn't get extra plates for the pizza when it came and she wasn't friendly. It's a turnoff, I'd rather be somewhere where our business is appreciated, customers are providing you a job after all!  The in-laws like it here so we may come back when they visit, hopefully things will improve. I love the Arribas near the mall on Bell Rd just wish this one would be the same!

Great selection of everything and fair prices! Our more recent visit was to build our own 6 pack of beer for my Dad's birthday, they have a ton to choose from!  My husband and I come here frequently, only complaint is that the cashiers are always in a bad mood! The other employees on the floor are very helpful if you have any questions regarding a product or if you need help finding something they always point us in the right direction.

We came here on a Saturday morning and I suppose they're probably busier on the weekend mornings. The woman who took our order through the drive thru was very friendly but they were out of a few types of donuts. The woman at the window wasn't friendly at all. We ended up getting a half a dozen donuts and one iced coffee. The donuts were all really good and very fresh, surprisingly! The coffee was terrible though.

I love JJ definitely my choice over other chain sub shops, employees are pretty friendly and service is fast. Wish they delivered by our place! Only complaint is that is you want peppers on your sub you have to pay extra and there isn't much on the subs already so I think that's unnessary. Other than that two thumbs up.

I've been here two more times since my last review but both times the yogurt I wanted was out! I guess that's either the really popular one and I'm unlucky or they didn't make enough. Staff is super friendly though and I still enjoyed coming here this visit (I wish they had raspberries as a topping though). My son loves picking different toppings and he gobbles it all right up. We will be back & hoping the yogurt I want isn't all gone!

We've been back here several times since my last review. It's always nice and clean inside, we're greeted when we walk in the door and the cashier always makes sure to ask if we need sample cups to try the flavors. I think they have about 8 or 10 flavors to choose from and they usually have something for everyone, a wide range of tastes. They have a ton of different toppings to add if you like those as well. They also have a nice outdoor seating area, it's a pretty decent size if you have a larger group.  My son loves coming here and it's a healthier option for a sweet treat! OH and they have punch cards so after so many visits you get one free and I think Tuesdays are double punch days :)

Never would have came here if it weren't for Yelp, read some reviews one day and just had to come in to try this place out, I was not disappointed!  I think this place is family owned/operated, everyone is very friendly and service is fast! They do "kids eat free" nights so would recommend that if you have children. They seem to stay pretty busy (we came on a Saturday) but I noticed they do carry out so that's very convenient! We ate inside, the seating area is small-ish and we did have to wait for a table to be cleaned but as I said they were pretty busy and they cleaned a table for us right away.   The prices are a little higher than I had expected coming in BUT well worth it! My family and I look forward to coming back!

We enjoyed watching the hockey game and having a few beers, it was a lot of fun!

So I guess the place has been here for about a year and a half, I've never noticed it before but happened to be shopping in the area and my husband and I decided to give it a try (after checking Yelp reviews first!). We were here on a Thursday afternoon, around 2pm, not at all busy which at first worried me a bit but then again it was Thursday afternoon. We were seated right away by the hostess, the server was at our table in less than 5 minutes for our drink order and was back again within another 5 minutes for our food order. The menu prices are very reasonable and if you check in on Yelp you can get a free dessert (I think there was two free options to choose from). I ordered the Carne Asada plate, which came with the standard rice and beans and a side of tortillas. The Carne Asada was good, not the best I've ever had but it was good. My husband ordered a burrito and I can't remember which one it was but he said it was very good. We also saw that they serve Menudo on the weekend, which my husband loves, I'm not a fan but I'm definitely willing to come back to try some other dishes. I want to say they have a Mariachi band on either Fridays or Saturdays but I would call and check which day it is for sure if that's why you want to go :)

I've been craving some egg rolls but couldn't decide on a place to go that was closer to home, my husband remembered this location and we figured we would give it a try!  When we walked in it was pretty busy but we were seated right away and had our drink order taken. It took a few minutes for our server to return for our food order but like I said they were pretty busy during the lunch hour rush. It is a pretty small building and it gets a bit noisy so conversation is a little difficult.  I ordered the sweet and sour chicken with a side order of egg rolls, my husband order one of the spicer dishes. When our food was brought out they brought me the wrong order so I had to wait a little longer for mine but I had my egg rolls to munch on. When my plate came out everything was perfect. My husband isn't big on Asian cuisine but admitted he really enjoyed his as well and that we will definitely have to return!   We ordered from the lunch specials and received soup before our meal, the soup was amazing! The prices were great, very affordable, we will definitely be stopping here for lunch again :)

Such a fun place! I love coming in here to look around and the store owner is very friendly, definitely love having a comic/toy store on this side of town!   Prices here are very comparable to prices I've seen other places online and feel great about supporting this small business. Always look forward to returning here!   They also have a Facebook page, the store owner said they post upcoming events on there, definitely something to check out!

My husband and I got a couch and a love seat here a few months back and have plans to move in a few more months so we've been back here to get some ideas on what we might like to get for the new place. The employees here never hassle you and I don't dread coming here to just look, it's a very pleasant experience. I don't think we will ever buy furniture at another furniture store again, they have very reasonable prices and I've been very pleased with the service (and product) provided to us so far!

This place, simply put, is amazing!   A really fun atmosphere, the whole place was put together really well. The staff were very friendly, the restaurant was very clean and service was pretty quick!  I got the Bison Burger, I was feeling adventurous because I've never had bison before but it was really good! I'll probably have beef the next time around but I enjoyed it, everything on the burger was really fresh! The fries here are amazing, I didn't even order any for myself (I got a side salad with my burger) but I was French fry thieving from my son's plate.   Looking forward to returning here soon!

So glad to have Oregano's on this side of town!   Came here to meet a friend for lunch, middle of the week and there's still a wait time so expect it to be busy when you visit despite the time of day!   I just got a slice of pizza and a side salad, prices are definitely reasonable and the food and service were good. The menu says a giant slice of pizza but it was two normal slices of pizza so took one home. I had to save room for that amazing Pizza Cookie, LOVE that thing! You have to get one if you come here, it's basically mandatory.   I can't wait to come back again, I'm going to have to take days off work so I can come in the middle of the day when they aren't as busy! Definitely want to try some pasta dishes... And eat more cookies!

We needed to bring our cat in to get checked out and they had a special here for half off the check up/visit fee for new patients, so we figured we would give them a try.   When we arrived for our appointment we were roomed very quickly, which was awesome! The staff are very friendly and attentive, they really care about our furry little friends :)  The vet gave us additional info to read up on for our cat and we had to get some medications for him, they gave us a printed calendar to keep track of his doses. The vet also called the following day to see how our buddy was doing. I actually ended up calling the office twice regarding his medications and some questions I had and each time the front desk gal was super helpful.   We look forward to our follow up visit and we will bring our other two pets here in the future!

This was our first time here, used the drive thru. I read other reviews saying it was expensive but I thought we got a lot of food for the price. I just got the carne asada burrito and I couldn't finish it. My boyfriend got a breakfast burrito and my son got the quesadilla kids meal, no complaints!

Tsk tsk señor taco, so disappointed.  I love this place but tonight was so disappointing!  While ordering the worker could not hear anything my boyfriend and I were saying to him through the drive thru and by the time he finally got the order right we were practically yelling so he could hear us.  Got the order, no forks. Opened the order (I got cheese enchiladas) the cheese inside wasn't melted, not even a little. The enchiladas weren't even a little warm. Rice and beans were okay. I live literally 2 minutes away, if even that, my food should be hot. Just really disappointed in service and quality tonight.
