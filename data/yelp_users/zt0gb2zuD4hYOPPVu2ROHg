So Jessica ( I hope that was her name) was amazing. She had great customer service, friendly, personable, and kind. I had been running around trying to find a decent sized icecream cake for a going away party for a friend last minute. Not only was she very helpful she even drew on the cake and wrote some stuff in icing for me. How cool is that?! I thought for sure I wouldn't be able to find someone to do it last minute and so quickly too. I was in and out in no more than 10-15 minutes. Asked my questions, got straight answers, and was out of the door ten minutes later. Maybe not even that Long. Everybody loved the cake when I brought it to the party and complimented it and asked where in the world I got it. Nobody could believe it was a cold stone cake they for sure thought I got it from some place expensive.   Anyway, hands down the best service I've ever gotten. Will recommend all my friends to get their birthday cakes from cold stone and specifically from that location. In fact I'll be back in September to get my friends birthday cake and October for mine(:   Thanks for the great service(:

man I love this place. good spot to sit and do homework or sit and spend time with friends, or have a meeting for work. There is also a seating area outside that is dog friendly. the kale and spinach salad is my favorite, and the mac and cheese in the best in town.

I'm so beyond frustrated.   Time and time again I have to leave this park because there are too many aggressive dogs and their owners don't seem to care.   I just want my dog to be able to play with other dogs without the fear of her getting attacked.   This is the last straw for me.  Won't be coming back here ever again.

Tall guy with blonde hair that works there has no personality. Never has. He may hate his job but it is his job to fake it and if you can't then customer service isn't for you. This guy is never happy every time I go in. Normally I don't care but he's ruining the barista reputation. He messed up my drink, didn't give me my current change back and then acted like I was ruining his life by asking for the correct change.   Starbucks needs to fix this.  It's embarrassing.

Get a different drink every time I come here which is like everyday sometimes twice a day. Everything is amazing. Haven't gotten something i didn't like. Staff is amazing, most of them know me by now. Starbucks has nothing on the Dutch.

Elevate is a good old fashion Christian coffee shop. I love it here. I feel comfortable to sit and discuss the bible with my friends over a decent cup of coffee. Not gunna lie, the coffee isn't that great, but the atmosphere is comfortable.

I am so in love with this adorable little hole in the wall. First off, the atmosphere is perfect. I can sip on my delicious iced almond milk dirty chai outside in the tranquil little garden they have which is shaded by trees and umbrellas while I read a book or catch up with some friends. I wish I remembered the name of the guy at the front taking orders and making drinks, he's funny and makes pretty damn good drinks. By the way the food is delicious. I got the vegetarian sandwhich so I can't say much for the other stuff but mine was pretty great. And if I want to come back later in the evening with my friends and have a couple drinks and some dinner it's a great spot for that as well.   So overall, great service and good people!

Lori is one of the nicest groomers I've ever been to. She truly loves animals and you can tell. And she's pretty inexpensive so that's a plus. Will only go here from now on.
