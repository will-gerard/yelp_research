Maybe I've lived in Arizona too long, but it is freezing in here. At least I won't get caught sleeping. Parking is only 2 hours.  The rest is great.  Plenty of seats to work, friendly service, drink was typical Starbucks.  Nice Patio with ample seating.

I not only have a future Olympic swimmer on my hands, but she will be a gold medalist.  Well, maybe not, but I'm pretty confident she won't drown.  We started swimming lessons in Los Angeles at almost a year old since our doctors recommended them for our daughter.  2 years and 1 million dollars later she's a decent swimmer.    When we first moved here the only swimming lessons anyone mentioned was Hubbard, so honestly that is why we ended up there.  Our first 2 group lessons were free (adult gets in the water still).  If nothing else you should at least give it a try...it's free.  Quickly I moved her to the semi-private lessons (2 students Max), while expensive $122/month (30 minute lessons 1x per week) I had gotten her as far as I could in the water and wanted to see her progress a little faster.  I'm really glad I made the switch even though the first 2 weeks were brutal not only for me but for the entire facility.  My girl screamed the entire lesson, but after the first 2 weeks she really started learning fast and was more comfortable.  Many times we ended up with private lessons just because the other child didn't show.  Now that my girl is 3 years old she is in a group class (up to 4 kids) which is $81/month for a 30 minute lesson 1x per week.  -Don't forget your reusable swim diaper they don't allow disposable swim diapers.  I learned the hard way. -The water is super warm and the air is warm too -8 weeks to 6 months FREE group classes -Immaculate facilities  -Instructors are great  The only thing I don't really like is I have no idea how my daughter is doing.  All of the sudden she graduated to a new level (she's a Jellyfish now) and I didn't even know she was close.  I do wish I got an update every now and then about how she is doing or what she needs to work on etc. Our swimming lessons in LA gave us a quick update after every lesson and let us login online to see what skills they have mastered.  They do win ribbons for passing certain things.  The kids get excited about getting the ribbons which is fun, but if your child doesn't get a ribbon for a few weeks you start wondering how they are doing.  Most important to me she loves it, loves her teacher and is getting stronger.

You don't come here because you are looking for authentic Mexican food.  You don't come back here because you think to yourself "oh wow that chimichanga was the best I ever had."  You come because:  1. They have random fake birds hanging all over the celing   2. They have $1.99 margaritas made from a mix with the cheapest tequila. 3. They put an entire tub of sour cream on your chimichanga 4. They give your kid balloon puppies upon entering 5. They are family owned and always smiling (not even sure how this is possible) 6. The chips are always stale and they keep them coming 7. The salsa is above average and makes those stale chips taste even better 8. You can dine with random cardboard hotties  So, just keep drinking those margaritas, eating those stale chips, looking at random birds and eating your sour cream on top of a very deep friend chimichanga because nothing else matters in life.   And most likely you will find me here because this place is just plain fun.

Don't be confused at how fancy this place looks on the outside the Pho hits the spot and is decently priced.  We arrived around 12:30pm on a rainy day. The place was busy. We had a small wait for a table, but everyone was pleasant.   We got the 2B (Pho), fried rice for the little one, an array of spring rolls, iced coffee and of course the Thai iced tea.  $25  I didn't try the iced coffee but apparently if you need a kick in the pants to wake up this is the stuff. Mr. C was jittery for the next hour.   I was stuffed and satisfied. We will be back.

Mr. C and I were in definite need of a relaxing weekend.  We normally stay with family when going to Phoenix, but we all know that is not very relaxing.  We decided to take advantage of an amazing deal The Phoenician was doing.  We used points to stay here and it was only 6,000 points a night.  Really can't beat that price especially when we looked online the rooms were going for $500/ night.    This resort definitely makes you feel like you aren't in Phoenix anymore.  When we first got there it was first class treatment from the start. We didn't want to pay the outrageous valet parking fee since self-parking really isn't that much further.  The valet guys were nice enough to let us park our car there until we checked in and got settled in our room.  Plus they even recognized Mr. C from the last time we were there.  Oh wait, we've never been there.  ha ha  We had Miss Mila with us and they gave us a crib with free Johnson & Johnson baby products all ready for us.  We mostly hung out at the pools which were the perfect temperature with a plethora of towels for everyone.  One day we even had some family ( a total of 4 kids) come hang out with us without any problems.  I don't want to get anyone in trouble, but we took the kids to go on the water slide only to find out they were all too short to go on it.  After seeing the sunken kids faces the nice man let them go down one time as long as they were with an adult.  I think that was the highlight of their day.  Thank you!  One of the negatives was having pizza delivered to the room was a huge hassle.  Basically Mr. C and to go all the way to the front gate to meet the delivery guy to get the pizza.  I guess they don't let delivery people onto the grounds.    Another negative was we did find one small roach in our room.  We reported it and apparently they thought it was necessary to come to our room and spray the entire room.  Let's just say I didn't want to be smelling that and I sure didn't want my daughter smelling that stuff.  I would have switched rooms, but what a hassle plus it wasn't offered to us.    Overall we enjoyed our stay and felt the resort was perfect for what we needed.  We will be back.  I need to try the spa next time.    Stayed November 2012

I'm not sure how I am writing this because I died after hiking this. Yes, I am out of shape. I admit it.  How do you know you are about to die? You aren't even halfway up the mountain and everyone keeps asking if you are okay. "Who me? Oh yeah I'm great. I always look this pale."  There are a couple sad parts (besides me dying) some people run up this mountain without stopping. Show off much? The people complaining about others going slow well that was me. Sorry I got in your way. Don't worry though I won't be doing this trail again for quite some time.   The parking lot was full the day we went and all the surrounding streets say no parking. We parked a mile away and added that to our hike. It was awesome.   This hike is not good for toddlers. Ours made it about 1/5 of the way. Wish I would have turned around when she did. Seriously though it is a fun hike that everyone should do. It is a little crowded, but worth it. Great views and exercise. Be ready to eat when you get home. I was famished.

After my disaster of a haircut I was very nervous at trying any salon in Phoenix. "Hello welcome to Phoenix let me make you look as ugly as possible."  Maybe they were just worried I would be competition for some of the ASU hotties. I couldn't go another day without getting my hair fixed it was driving me insane. I turned to Yelp and found The Root Salon. They are extremely busy and it was a little difficult to get an appointment, but they fit me in the next week. I had to go one whole week looking like I put my head in a blender.  Luckily I survived.   I showed up a little early and Jillian quickly took me in. She offered me a drink but this time I came equipped with my Starbucks. She asked me what I wanted and I told her "please just fix it, at this point as long as I'm not crying we are good." I got the Yelp deal which was an eyebrow touch up and conditioning treatment with my haircut.   All I can say is Jillian Jillian Jillian you need to charge more girl. She not only fixed my hair but it looks great for only $35.  (Well, just charge more for everyone else. I'm good with the $35.)

This is a great neighborhood park. Very safe and friendly. We come here often. Right down the street from LGO.   The play structure is decent, but nothing crazy. Has a rock wall, monkey bars, a few slides and swings etc. It is on sand so you will be sure to bring home a tired dirty kid. Everyone shares their sand toys and their is water if you like getting super messy, which my kid does.  I wouldn't travel far to come to this park, but I do know families who moved away from the area who still drive over because the people and kids are great. I love this neighborhood.   There are a few tables and one area with tables and shade. I've seen a few birthday parties being thrown here.   Lots of space for dogs to run around or soccer games to be played. Plenty of street parking.   No bathrooms which is horrible because kids aren't very good at holding it, but there is a big tree.

Yes, I do realize my ticket was only $7.25 so I'm not sure what I was expecting...  Give me back my $15+ movie tickets where I get assigned large leather comfy seats, caramel corn, gigantic  screens and amazing audio.   If you are looking for small screens where the movie doesn't even fill the entire screen, barely audible sound, and extremely old and dirty chairs you can watch a movie at my house.  I'll even make fresh popcorn.   This theater is located in the food court of Scottsdale Fashion Park. I had some difficulty finding it since my GPS said I had arrived and all I saw was a parking lot. Luckily I got to walk through Nordstrom on my journey.   Let's all hope they do a major remodel in the near future until then unfortunately I will not be back.

So I get it the joke is on me. I get an appointment at a cute little salon in Scottsdale that gets great reviews. Sit down after rushing from a preschool farm event and I see some lovely iced tea and lemonade sitting in the corner. Wow how refreshing. That would be nice right about now, but no it just wants to sit there and taunt me.   I'm definitely more introverted than most and you don't have to have lengthy conversations with me, but there is such a thing as awkward silence. I tried to fill that void, but gave up asking questions. We will just sit here in peace and continue just eyeing that lemonade.   "So, what do you think?" I was thinking WTF? You can't be done, but of course I just asked if he could layer the back a little better. After trying to do that I decided to leave. It was $50, normally $65 but it was my first time here. I said goodbye to the lemonade and iced tea because neither my stylist or the lady at the front gave me a second thought, basically under there breath said have a nice weekend. I'm not sure what kind of product they have here but I had fly aways all over and my hair is severely uneven. It did not look good. I'm not used to leaving a salon with hair that doesn't look like you could go out on the town. Went home and fixed it the best I could, but I am anxiously waiting a couple months before going to get this fixed. May have to travel all the way back to LA for this one.

This hike is literally 5 minutes and could probably be done in flip flops. You get to take a picture with a hole. You can be in horrible shape and still post selfies hiking. What more could you want?   This hike is right next to the Zoo.  Go to the left and you will see different parking lots.  If you want an even better workout park at the farthest lot.  It will take you an extra 5 minutes to get to the trail.  If your 3 year old can't handle Camelback like mine can this is the place for you.  Recommended for all locals with kids in Phoenix area.

We ordered the Rose macaroons for my daughters first birthday.  I had to order desserts at the last minute because I came down with the flu and was unable to make them.  She was nice enough to make the macaroons for our party despite the late notice.  I ate one and couldn't finish it.  They were way too sweet and had an odd taste.  Maybe it is an acquired taste to be eating rose, but no one at our party liked them and they just sat there.  They cost me about $50.  They did look pretty and were a nice color of pink, so if you want them on display perfect just don't have anyone eat them.

Yes, my 3 year old spilled salsa not once not twice but 3 times. Our sever happily cleaned it up all 3 times.   Probably only 1 or 2 salsas that are mild enough for kids. Ours enjoyed the cliantro one and the Pico de gallo. She tried a few others but immediately downed water and her face turned a little red. She may have grown a little hair on her chest. Our favorite salsas were the peanut and guacamole.   I had the street tacos. Carne Asada taco was on point. Ranking the 3 I had 1. Carne Asada 2. Al Pastor 3. Chicken  Wish I could tell you about the rice but the girl ate it all, so if she ate it I'm sure you will enjoy it too.   Next time I need multiple margaritas. Happy hour, anyone?!?!

I would like to take this time to formally apologize to all the patrons sitting on the patio February 20th, 2015. We had 3 children who were experiencing what is known as sugar high and it would take them quite some time to come down from this.  I was unfortunately taken away by the awesome soundtrack coming from the speakers and enjoying the blissful taste of homemade ice cream, strawberries and shortcake to care that my child and her friends were running a ruckus. Don't worry I am looking into facilities we can check all of us into.  We got 3 children cones, the strawberry shortcake sundae and the how now brown cow.  There was no way I could finish my sundae although I did try, but I don't recommend it.    All the ice cream is made in the shop and is delicious. You can tell it is handmade. It is pretty hard to screw up ice cream, but I've done it so it can be done.  The shop is small, but adorable with lots of cool photo ops.  Can anyone say "Instagram?" The patio is perfect to hang out on.  We will definitely be back to get our ice cream fix.  I still need to get that pretzel cone.  2 of my favorite things into one.  The parking lot is fairly busy but we did easily find a spot.  Next to some cool restaurants, so get dinner and dessert and go home fat.

The first time I came here they had the red carpet and velvet ropes pulled out for me and it was very private/discreet just how I like it, but when my friends and I got there they must not have recognized me as a famous celebrity. (Remember that time I was asked to be an extra on Entourage, but am so cool and popular I turned them down?) They took one look at us and turned us away.  Maybe because I showered and dressed nicely they didn't recognize me.  The bouncer/security guy or whatever you want to call him did get my number and said he would text me later.  I wasn't sure I wanted to give it to him since you know I'm taken. He reassured me it was only to let us know when a table was available, but can you really trust bouncer/security/whatever the h** he is?    The whole thing was very strange to me and a little pretentious.  I get they are trying to be different with the whole "let's not get it crowded in here because I want to look cool instead of making more money," but really is all that BS necessary.  If you are going to put on this big show you better be f'ing cool. While I think this bar/cocktail parlour whatever you want to call it is pretty decent it is far from f'ing cool.  I never have gotten turned away at a bar in LA even when there were mixologists (better known as bartenders).    Anyways, 30 minutes or so later they did text us but we were busy then and were debating on even going back. (Apparently they do let you make reservations.  I am more of a drop in kind of person though).  The next couple times I came here it was during happy hour.  HH is daily 4-7pm.  The happy hour was not busy.  There was no one outside and we easily got a table and/or seat at the bar. (btw-if you are like me you will totally miss the door the first time.  They have no signage on it. I tried a couple doors before actually finding the right one.  Don't worry you won't be the only one or oh wait am I the only one? I'm just not cool enough for this trendy stuff). The crowd is interesting.  You are going to find everyone from elderly, 20 somethings, fancy dresses, cut-off shorts, frat boys, business men etc.  I did not see many hipsters though.  While I haven't tried their signature Ramen Burger from all of the food I had I would skip the food altogether and just have drinks.  The best part of the Fried Chicken with watermelon kimchi was the kimchi.  I think maybe they should just give me a big ole side of watermelon kimchi without the chicken.  The meat and cheese plate was weak and expensive.  Only 2 kinds of cheese, no nuts and no olives (my favorite).  You can get a way better meat and cheese plate at Postinos for $1 less.  The smashed chips were probably my favorite and honestly they were only okay nothing special.  I would like to try the popcorn because I've heard it is good.  Popcorn and a cocktail sounds nice right about now too.  The drinks I have had here have been great and they aren't weak.  I do think the happy hour drink prices are an amazing deal. You can get a good cocktail for $6. I also like the whole concept of telling them what kind of drinks you like and they just make something for you. A lot of bars in LA do this and I think it is a fun way to learn and try different things. I am an avid reader, but the drink menu is a little intimidating to me.  It is a book that I need to take home and study in case their is an exam later.   *After going here numerous times and realizing the service is horrible and treats me like shit on there shoe I will never be returning.  There are way too many cool places in Phoenix where the bartenders are fun, laid back and just plain cool that have great drinks.  Why would anyone want to come and deal with the snooty attitudes at B&T. My prediction is they will be out of business in less than 5 years.  They are all way too pretentious and arrogant.  It is not becoming to think you are better than everyone else.  Why does Valley Bar have a line outside and you are empty? Because of your attitude.  I won't be back!

Not sure why this park gets no love. Someone from my playgroup said you can come across "unsavory" people. Yes, this park is not near $500K homes, their is a large apartment complex across the street and the park goers are diverse, but I'm probably as shady as it gets, so yeah you should probably stay away.  I'm still getting used to the fact random individuals can carry a gun in Phoenix, but I don't know you well enough to start talking politics.  Back to the park...  Put this park in Los Angeles and you would have 100 kids running around. This park is huge.  The play structure is huge and fairly new.  The structure is on sand.  They have bathrooms and surprisingly they are not that dirty for a public park.  There are sand volleyball courts and lots of grass for dogs and/or children to run.  On the weekends I've seen birthday parties and people playing sand volleyball etc., but during the weekday this place has hardly anyone around.    Some people mention disc golf is played here, but I am fairly lame and have no idea what disc golf even is.  Supposedly there is a six station fitness course too, but yeah I'm not into that.  I get enough exercise running after the rugrats.    There's a Starbucks drive thru on the corner of Indian School and 28th, so make sure to grab some caffeine.  We usually go to Kachina Park because it is closer and usually more kids are there, but I come here for some variety.
