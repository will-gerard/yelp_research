I've been coming here for years and will never go anywhere else. Lynn does the best manicures and Paula does a great pedicure that easily lasts for 2 weeks. My only con would be when I make appointments in advance and I come in to find my girl has been given another client and I either have to wait or settle for someone else. This is something the owner should address especially for a regular!

I'm a little late with this review, but it is worth the read!  I have been going to jalape√±os for 15 years. The chips and salsa have always been superb, however, the margs have never been a reason to go there. Over the last few years my family and I have noticed the service and level of quality slowly decline. The last visit I made and will EVER make was the final straw. It was new years day with a one page menu and a way overpriced buffet. To make a long story short we were accused, by the owner, of our 4 year old eating food off the buffet without paying, even though it was free for kids under 5. When we were charged for him and the 10 grapes he "stole" she told us we were "Wasting food".  She continued to speak to us like we were 5 years old and made us feel like criminals. I will sorely miss my chips and salsa, but I will not miss paying too much for poor service and overpriced average food.

Great outside dining and bar is outside but covered. Stickey buns are a tradition and a must! Great place to bring out of town guests.

Went here for my birthday and had a great time. Only negative was they ran out of bread and our server had obviously not been serving long. The pizza is by far the best in the state!

Great classic burger and the fries are Amazing! My only suggestion would be narrow down the servers to 1! Too many people stopping by the table asking incessantly if they could get us something. I was constantly telling people we'd already been taken care of. If you're wanting privacy at dinner this is not your place.

Came here on a Friday for drinks and had a great experience. Was looking forward to trying out the food so brought the whole family for Sunday lunch. Bottom line, no one will be going back a second time. The chicken and the steak tacos (corn tacos which are homemade)  were so soggy they fell apart on the first bite. The carne asada was burnt and the beans were filled with loads of fatty pork.  Chips and salsa were average but you are charged $3. I hope they are still tweaking the menu and will change the "family style" serving style. The portions are definitely not big enough to share and people get confused on who's food belongs to who.

If you're looking for a realtor in the Valley, look no further!  Michelle is the best!  She grew up in AZ so she's seen it grow into the big city that we know today.  She's knowledgeable about the housing market and will guide you thoroughly through the buying or selling of your home.  She just helped my son with his first home purchase which can be a very stressful and daunting experience.  His was quite the opposite!  I can't say enough about Michelle and her professional, efficient style of assistance in buying a home.
