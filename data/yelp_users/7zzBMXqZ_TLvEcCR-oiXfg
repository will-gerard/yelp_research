I started coming here in 2013 I believe. I found the office because they take my insurance.  The doctor gave me tons of options as far as contacts that would work best for me and he really took the time to answer my questions. However, the front office staff can leave a bad taste.   In June of 2014 I bought glasses and unfortunately they broke about 3 weeks ago. I was disappointed because they were less than a year old so I returned to see if they could be fixed. I was surprised to see that the optometrist was up front assisting customers. He kindly offered to replace my glasses for $35 since it was under a year and I agreed. I anxiously waited a few weeks to get the call letting me know that my glasses were ready and I got it at 4pm on a Friday. I was excited to hear that they were in and made the decision to go pick them up first thing Saturday morning. I live in Tempe, so you can understand my frustration when I drove all the way to the office only to discover that they were closed that Saturday due to the Easter weekend. I'm all for the long holiday weekend, I think it's great. However, instead of telling me the normal office days and hours over the voicemail, the staff should have mentioned that they would be closed that Saturday...  I finally went and got my glasses today, and was once again greeted by a cold staff. Long story short I got my glasses, however, I'm no longer interested in getting my eyes cared for at this office. It's disappointing because I really liked the optometrist, but the rest of the staff is terrible.

I've been coming here for over 2 years, this place is awesome. I get gel manicures and they typically last about 3 weeks... the polish stays perfect but my nails end up growing! I'm so glad I found Sam, he's my favorite :)  Everyone is super friendly and the place is pretty clean. I'd definitely recommend.

I took the CNA course here and had an awesome experience! I just took my state boards on 4/9/15 and found out I passed both the skills and written portions, which I accredit 100% to the teachers at AMTI. I took the night class and had Shawnon for my skills instructor and he was great, if you listen and pay attention like he says you'll do great in the class.   As far as the clinical portion of the class goes I thought it was excellent. The instructor that went to the facility with us, Terri, was extremely helpful and always around to answer questions.    Additionally, you really can't beat the cost of the course. Plus it's only 4 weeks of class time and 1 week of clinicals which is shorter than any other program I looked into!

Danny did an excellent job stripping the old tint and tinting the Windows on my IS300. When I arrived I really didn't know what I wanted, he was extremely patient with me and explained all the different types of tints and shades. He was very honest about everything and really took the time to make sure I was confident in my choice! I'm a total airhead and forgot to vacuum my car before bringing it in (I have a German shepherd that loves car rides, so you can imagine what the interior looked like) and when I returned to pick up my car Danny had vacuumed the interior to ensure that there was no dog hair when the tint was applied. He went above and beyond by doing that in my opinion. He also was done with the work extremely quick; I dropped the car off at 8am and it was done by 12:30! I'm very happy with the quality and will definitely be bringing my other cars to him in the future!

Seriously the best! She's been doing my hair for quite awhile now and I always leave happy. She's amazing with color, too! I love how she does my ombr√©, she makes it look natural instead of choppy like some salons :)

I got in an accident over a year ago and took my car to Elevens for the repairs. Not only did they do an amazing job repairing my bumper, they also matched my pearl white paint perfectly (and quickly). They're definitely very detail oriented here and I feel like they treated my car as if it was one of their own. A year later and the paint still looks flawless! I hopefully won't be in another accident but for any future body work or paint I'll be back :)
