I went to mail a package today and was told that if I didn't give my address, phone number and email address to put into their system they would not mail my package.  I mail through UPS and the general post office all the time and have never been told that I need to give my personal information to be logged into a system I order to mail something.  The owner "claimed" that he would need to contact me if there was a problem with the package (yet my package had a return address label that should ensure that if there were a problem that it would be  mailed back to me) but when I told him that I would provide an email address and that is all he said that would not suffice.  I asked why he needed all of my personal information and if he was planning to sell it to a third party or add me to their mailing list (b/c I don't want any more junk mail, telemarketer phone calls, etc.) and he did not answer my question.  He said rather, "Take Your Business Elsewhere," if you can't give me your personal information.  I was appalled!  I promptly went across the street to UPS who mailed my package without any of my information for their system with no problem-- MAILERS BEWARE!  Do not go to this place!  Would not recommend at all!  And, the lady whom was "trying" to put my information into the system could not spell... I had to literally spell my name out three times before she understood and its a common name!

This new menu at Top of the Rock is unreal!  Absolutely amazing--with the addition of new Chef de Cuisine Akos Szabo and Executive Chef Gregory Wiener, this restaurant has been brought to a whole new level!  From locally sourced ingredients & amazing views of Tempe, to live music and exquisite service, this place is a MUST try!  One of my new favs in the valley!  Check out the grilled, honey lime shrimp, the mouth watering Pan Seared Baja scallops and White Marble Farms' Pork Tenderloin--- each bite melts in your mouth!  For dessert, the grapefruit cardamom panna cotta and chocolate mousse are literally to die for!  A++++++++++!!!!

Cibo is literally my favorite restaurant in Arizona!  This quaint, completely wonderful restaurant is an incredible experience.  Love the outdoor patio with the twinkle lights and the food is to die for!  The best pizza I've ever had!  My fav is the Salsiccia con Patate made with mozzarella, sausage and potato!  Their margarita pizza, Antipasto speciale and even the Nutella and banana crepe dessert are also delish!  I would reccomend this restaurant to anyone!

Uptown Bridal was an amazing experience!  I just purchased my dress from them and was so pleasantly happy with their service, the quality of their merchandise and beautiful atmosphere!  They cater to your needs, give honest opinions, do not upsell but rather, assist in finding their customers the best fitting dress for each brides' needs.  I would reccomend this boutique to any bride looking for a great shopping experience with reasonable pricing.  They really made me feel as if I was the only person there and didn't rush me through any of my decision making but really made me feel extra special!  Thank you Diane, Tonia and Nicole--you girls are the best!!!!!

I just went to the newest Spotted Donkey Cantina on Hayden and was so impressed with the food & ambiance!  The decor and lighting is aboslutley fantastic, and the restaurant is very versatile as it offers a bar/nightlife scene but also a dining atmosphere and two outdoor patios.  The food's presentation was exquisite and I am SERIOUSLY in love with the stuffed peppers!  Literally the best I've ever tasted!  They are filled with pork, cheddar-jack cheese, spanish rice in a tomato basil sauce.  And, the shrimp ceviche was also incredible--- very fresh and flavorful with fresh pineapple and avocado!  To boot, their margaritas are very tasty offered in lime, blood orange (the best!), prickly pear, mango and strawberry flavors!  Needeless to say, this is a must go restaurant!  Can't wait to go back soon!

LOVE this place!  I go to Tom's Thumb often for car washes as they always do an impeccable job!  My car is perfectly cleaned and I know that when I'm there, that its in good hands (can't unfortunately say the same for ANY other Scottsdale car wash!) The staff is always friendly, I never feel like they are trying to upsell me for anything I do not want/need and the atmosphere is clean and enjoyable!  The inside is adorable with the best BBQ pork in town-- (we go often for lunch!) and the deli area has the cutest cupcakes you have ever seen!  Planning to go back soon to snag one!  I also love the shop that is full of lots of knick-knacks and eclectic artwork, home d√©cor, quaint gifts and more!  And, my kids just adore the wooden chess set.  The waiting area comes equipped with water (so you aren't dying in this 100++ degree summer heat!) and is chock full of local magazines and newspapers to peruse.   Definitely give this place a thumbs up!  Love Tom's Thumb and will be back very soon!  PS- my husband says this is the only place he trusts me to go and get my car washed ;) I recommend it to everyone!
