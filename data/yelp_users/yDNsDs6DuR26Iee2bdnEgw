Great burgers, fries and a drink!  We love coming here for the family, you get to pick your toppings, dressings and more.  The choices of burger meat and size give you variety.  Can't forget the desert counter and shakes! I've been coming to Fuddruckers ever since I was a little boy with my family and now we bring our boys.  I haven't tried it yet, however I have seen some amazing looking gourmet salads eaten by other patrons.  Thanks for so many great memories!

One of the best experiences ever! I love architecture and Frank Lloyd Wright is my favorite architect. For Christmas my girlfriend bought the extended behind the scenes tour and loved every minute of it. They take you to the guest house, bedroom, dinning room, drafting studio, and 2 performance areas. They serve tea and a small snack and tell stories about the property, school, and architect the whole time. The guide was very knowledgeable, friendly and engaging. The property is beautiful and there is so much to see and enjoy. They have a nice gift shop and I would go back to take more tours anytime!

The sweet pork burrito is were it is at!  I get it with the corn salsa inside and then smothered with the red sauce and cheese on the outside.  The awards they have won for their sweet pork are no joke.  I wish they were open on Sunday, I will certainly be back otherwise!

We came here for a comedy show. Normally dive bars are great but this was very disappointing. They really should have known that having a special show they would need more than one bartender, or a bartender and a  server. We would have loved to order some food but we couldn't get the bartenders attention it was just to packed and once the comic started you wouldn't be able to hear anyways from a distance behind all the people packed around the bar. Never made it past our first round of drinks. I would try it one more time, maybe someone called in or something but we were hungry so that made us more grumpy about it!

While they say their pizza people, what they really excel at is their amazing variety of Mac and Cheese!  We have had several flavors however our favorite is the buffalo mini mac and cheese with added shredded chicken.  We usually get a couple mini's and share them.  We also find their wings to be a great deal with more than just celery on the side you really get some tasty treats with it.  Although I am not a fan of their house ranch personally, I will certainly be back.

Great family fun, we take the boys for an evening of batting practice for all us!  It is fun for the kids and adults..  We really get into the swing of things here!  The pricing is fantastic for only $10 you get 12 rounds and they have a choice of baseball or softball with different speeds for each.  They have a variety of automatic pitching options and cages to choose from including free gear to use at this Indoor batting cage.  With a small snack bar and clean restrooms, couldn't ask for more.  My only complaint is that the free to use helmets are a little too well worn and could use some updating.  We will definatly be coming back!

I have been twice now and surprisingly the chicken and waffles was actually my least favorite thing we tried. It was good but nothing great, the waffles were ok.  I would like to see a nice Belgian waffle. What was amazing is their biscuits and gravy, which we had both times we visited. It is huge and they have a special kick to them which makes them far better than your average biscuits and gravy.  The Oreo pancakes are amazing and are dessert and breakfast all in one! Friendly servers making everyone happy even when it was full.
