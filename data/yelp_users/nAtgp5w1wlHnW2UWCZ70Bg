I cannot explain the nightmare Cox has been. I had been a loyal customer to cox for 11 years, every time I moved on of the first things I did was set up my Cox account in the new house. However, now that times are a little harder on us financially, I had to cancel everything down to just the internet. The sales guy was trying to keep me from cancelling and telling me how much slower the internet was going to be without the phone line and cable bundle, and how I could rent the modem I was currently using for an extra $7 a month to keep the speed up. I simply did not have it in my budget to do these things. So they told me I had to send back the modem and the 2 cable boxes and sent me three packages to return them in. So I sent it all back. Then my last bill comes and it is twice what I was paying a month when I had all 3 services. I ended up cancelling the internet too, and had already purchased my own modem to use with a new company. All of a sudden there is a $108 charge on my account for a "phone modem". I spent many hours on the phone with Cox trying to figure out what this is and where it would possibly be. She explained what it would like, and I had never seen anything like that. So they ended up sending 2 tech's out, neither of which could find it either. So I called back and asked them to reverse the fee. You can't just make up some piece of equipment and say I must have it and charge me for it. They refused and kept telling me that they could give me the serial number of the piece of equipment. Not sure how that would help since I am not confused on what it is, I never received this. Why would I be trying to keep some piece of equipment that makes a cox phone work when i don't even have cox anymore? So I asked her if maybe this was installed at one of my previous addresses and she said she doesn't know. So she knows the serial number but not when or where it was given to me? That doesn't make any sense. So I asked them to check at my previous address. She kept talking in circles and I never got a straight answer as to what this is, when I received it or where it is. This company is a joke and they are just mad that I cancelled my service even though i had been a loyal customer for so long, I simply could not afford it and they tried repeatedly to "punish" me for cancelling by tacking on random charges. I wonder how many people don't even notice and just pay these random charges! Always check and double check any bill you receive from Cox and make sure they give you a specific list of every piece of equipment they install!

Very quick and friendly service. No upselling, in fact he gave me ideas of ways to save money even though it would make him less money! Will use again and refer to friends!

I had the weirdest experience with this company. There was an ad in The Arizona Republic for 50% off of tile, so I called and scheduled an appointment for an estimate. A guy came out and took measurements and quoted me a price that was a good $1,700 less then the previous quote we had. We seemed really happy with him and he even came by later that weekend and dropped off some samples for us to look at. I picked one out and I was ready to move forward. I called the office to have them write up an official quote and when it came back it was $1,200 more than what the guy had told me when he came out. When I emailed asking them about the difference in attached a picture of the quote they simply ignored me. I then sent them another email asking what had happened and they ignored me again. I still have the samples in my living room... Clearly we will be going with another company
