This is now my go to spot. Service is out of this world! Every sever remembers your name and has no problem explaining anything on the menu. The food is also top notch. I loved everything I have tried! The beer on tap is always changing and they have something for every palate! I will definitely be returning often

The food was awesome. I got the Jamaican jerk chicken wrap. Drink deals are awesome. 2 for the price of one on Thursday nights. But the service ruined it for me.....they were standing around and only paying attention to certain customers. I probably won't be back..

This shop is awesome! It's big and feels very comfortable when you walk in. The selection of hardware and juice fits any need you could have. Customer service is top notch. Bird helped me with all 1000 questions I asked. I would recommend this place to anyone and will definitely be returning often!
