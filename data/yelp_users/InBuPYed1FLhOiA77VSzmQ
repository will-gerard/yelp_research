I was really hesitant about this place after I read the yelp reviews....but because I was with a group and someone else was in charge of booking the hotel (and they already purchased a deal on Groupon), there was nothing I could do.   There were so many things wrong with this hotel.  First of all, they had errors with saving reservations made on Groupon.  My friend bought two rooms, but only one was reserved.  They accused us of not calling ahead of time, but we did because we had gone through Groupon and wanted to be sure.  Because they had events going on that weekend (there were 3 weddings that day), they could only provide me a room that wasn't even ready, in my opinion.  I was pretty frustrated because it was getting late/almost early morning after a sucky traffic-y 6-hour drive from Los Angeles.  Second, the guy checking us in was so rude.  He kept telling us to refer to the fine lines on Groupon (He sounded like he didn't read them himself because nothing on the Groupon mentioned anything he was talking about.)  He could not resolve the issue for us, and he was the night manager.  If I hadn't brought up the suggestion (which worked), he would have left us hanging.  Third, that room they provided had 2 maggots on the floor..  Luckily I didn't stay in that room, but that is disgusting!!  Fourth, the room that I stayed in had dripping AC.  Las Vegas is in the desert and it is HOT.  We have to have AC on all day, and it was constantly dripping.  It dripped all day and dripped all night - my friend could not sleep at all.  She had to sleep on the couch because it was bothering her.    Early morning at 7am the next day, we called to see if any rooms became available (my suggestion).  There was a room that we wanted, and they were able to move us.  However, our biggest complaint was that nothing was done on their end to make up for our inconvenience for the night.  They blamed the circumstances on Groupon (whose customer service was SO much better), even though we had called to verify our reservations by phone.   This hotel is really below average.  You get what you pay for..and might even be ripped off.  The gym and 3 pools are freely accessible by hotel residents.  Only the big pool by the office has a water fountain.  Accessing the resort is simple - it's a long oval shape with the office at the front.  The odd-numbered buildings are on one side, the even-numbered are on the other.  Next time I'm going to the Venetian..

Even though their rates are lower than most, I do not think it is worth it. Pay maybe $20 more to stay at Bellagio or another hotel that is newer and cleaner. Monte Carlo is old; the rooms are really average; casino is mediocre. They do have the buffet and M life, so it's ok if you're going for free.  Don't spend your money here.

I think the North outlet has better stores than the South outlet.  My major complaint is that it's outdoors. And in Vegas, temperatures go past 110 degrees.  Even with the misters, I cannot stand the walk from the parking structure to the stores and in between the stores.  Parking is another issue as well. It's so crowded that you might not find a spot until you circle all the way up to the top level of the structure!  My favorites here: Burberry, Michael Kors, Tory Burch, Kate Spade, etc. Selections at these stores are pretty comparable to those of the premium outlets in other locations.    If you go to the information center, you can buy a coupon book for $5!

With so many "voted best buffet in vegas" signs all around, I can assure you - stay away from Monte Carlo "The Buffet."  It is terrible and not worth it - even if it is only $17.99 (as opposed to $30-50 buffets elsewhere).  When I got there at 3:30 pm, it was supposedly the dinner menu (I even double checked with one of the waiters).  To my dismay, there was no prime rib, no sirloin/steak, no seafood. The one star goes to their amazingly moist rotisserie chicken. But who goes to eat chicken at a buffet??  Not worth the $18.  If they did have any sort of beef, it was not memorable.  The dessert selection was so awful; I took a small bite of what I thought would be good and was done.  No ice cream!! They do have a salad bar and a couple soups.  There were two different "chicken soups" when I last visited: one was sweet like carrots and the other was way to salty (even after diluting with water).  They do have a drink fountain, and you get drinks by yourself. The waiters are there to clear your tables.  But even at that, they didn't clear much of our table until plates were piling up and we were done..  Restrooms are just outside the buffet.  You have to leave the buffet and come back in through the exit.

This is one of the buffets I keep coming back to while in Vegas.  Brunch is just under $25, including tax, no tip. Restrooms are inside the buffet, which is nice.  You don't have to worry about exiting the buffet and not being able to come back in.  The line is long. Expect to show up when they open at 10 am and wait half an hour.  I got there at 11 and wasn't seated until 11:45. There are waiters who take drink orders.  I didn't see any soda fountains, like at Monte Carlo.   I liked that had an omelet station, where you could also get fried eggs.  For brunch meats, they had buffalo brisket, turkey, rotisserie chicken, flank, and ribs. The ribs were good!  That's what I would go back for.  Seafood was a bit limited.  They had cocktail shrimp and filets, but no crab (probably because this is brunch).  There was a variety of deserts, including soft serve ice cream and sorbet.  You definitely get your money's worth at this buffet - for the food as well as the service.

Huge Forever 21!!  I wouldn't be surprised if you got lost here, too.  This forever is located in the Fashion Show mall, across from Trump hotel.  When I got there, the mall closed at 9 pm, but Forever 21 didn't close until 10 pm. Yay!  There are so many clothes everywhere..and I couldn't help but feel like they were disorganized. I saw many identical tops but in different racks.  I find that a bit annoying because I don't want to look at the same thing three different times.  (especially if I'm on a time crunch!!)  The people who work here are very friendly.  I was greeted upon entering with a shopping bag and was asked about forever 21 emails.  The girls in the fitting room were so helpful! The only people who weren't friendly were the ones at the registers.  What a bad way to end a good shopping spree!  They had bad attitude and did not look happy at all.

They get 4 stars because of the service.  All the ladies working here were so friendly and helpful!  There's one lady at the front who greets you and lets you know the deals of the day.  (At the time it was 40% off all dresses. Woo!)  The other ladies ask if you need help looking for stuff or just try to chat with you.  So nice!  The reason I took off a star was for the ladies working at the register.  One of them looked up to smile at me, and then looked down and never budged.  The other lady told me to go to another register, where she was very short with me.  She did not smile, she did not talk much except to ask for my phone number, and she did not wish me a good day!    Bebe used to have cute clothes, but recently their style changed.. Hopefully it's not for the better because I haven't been able to find anything that fits me. Anyway, the service here really stood out to me, which is what will keep me coming back!

MMMMMM. I heard really good things about Postino, so I had to try it.  It is definitely a MUST try if you are in Phoenix (they have another location called Postino Arcadia).    I arrived on a Wednesday night, and only valet parking was available.  The servers/hosts inside were so nice and attentive.  The restaurant was dimly lit; there were stringed lights in the outdoor seating area.  The ambiance was nice and classy.  Yelp says they are casual attire; it's like more classy attire.  Try not to show up in shorts or flip flops..   Postino is a great place for wine and small plates.  I can't say much about the wine, but the food was great.  I tried the bruschetta.  For $14, you can try 4 flavors.  All of the flavors I tried were amazing; they were so PERFECT.  I've never had such combination of flavors elsewhere, and I wish Postino would open up in southern California (it's only 4 hours away!).. my favorite was the Prosciutto with Figs and Mascarpone - salty but sweet at the same time!  I also tried the Baker's Block.  They serve it literally on a block with pieces of everything.  It's like an appetizer sampler.  It's good to try, but it wasn't the star of the evening.    Just thinking about it is making me salivate!  I want to go back..

I was so disappointed!  This place is so overrated.  I had to wait outside for 30 minutes for a table, and the desert heat didn't help either.    I probably raised my expectations too high after drooling at all the photos on Yelp and wishing I were in Vegas.  The actual food was just average.  My friends' eggs benedict were so overpriced (but then again, everything in Vegas is 2-5x normal) and not worth.  My scramble was supposed to be made with egg whites and it turned out yellow.  I didn't bother asking them to redo it because they were so busy.  By the time I flagged down a waiter to put the order in, the rest of my party would be finishing up and ready to get the check.  The scramble had way too much spinach and the cheese not cooked enough.    The frozen hot chocolate that everyone raves about was THE worst thing on the menu.  It was like eating chopped ice cubes and cocoa powder.  Just no.  Plus, it's not worth the price, maybe a little better if you share the larger size.   For some real food that is worth your time and money, try getting out of the strip and supporting the local Vegas businesses.

I found Pita Di Vita on yelp and stopped by for lunch because of the reviews.  It wasn't too hard to find, coming down Warner Rd.  It's adjacent to a dance/supply store, near a ginormous gym.  Parking was not hard to find.  It was good to get inside to avoid the heat outside.  (They do have seating outside.)  They are open every day 11a - 9p.    When I entered, I forgot all the recommendations for food that I had just read, so I asked the guy at the counter for his personal recommendations.  He was very friendly and helpful.  He suggested the chicken shawarma, which is like a chicken wrap with pickles!  It was $8.10, including tax, and it was worth it.  They put in more chicken than I thought they would, and the amount of veggies was just right.  I'd come back to try the curry, which is also popular.  One suggestion.. I don't remember if they had sides, but I would have liked to have fries.. Or have lunch specials that come with drink and a side.

One of the better buffets in Vegas!  Almost $50 for dinner, but with very carefully prepared foods - very pleasing to the eyes, nose, and tongue.  Get the gelato (various flavors) and smoked salmon slices!  Minus one star: I was so disgusted with the spilled beer on the register counter and on the ground.  I rested my elbow on one end, and the smell of beer lingered throughout the dinner.  Blegh!

I had some time to kill before a show at the Smith Center, so I found eat. on yelp for good brunch!  Eat. is in downtown Vegas.  Since it was my first time, the area really didn't look as good as the strip. Eat. is on the corner of 7th and Carson.    I found street parking easily on 7th ($1 / hour, max 2 hours).  There are pay stations everywhere conveniently.  I had a party of 6, so I had to wait to be seated until entire party was present.  I was on a time crunch though, so when the rest of the party was still parking, the manager let me be seated first.  We were able to get a table right away and put in our orders before it got too late.  On a Saturday afternoon, I thought it was still busy.  Some parties had a short 10-15 minute wait.  This restaurant reminded me of Cheeky's in Palm Springs - very good brunch place with outdoor seating.  Food was really good.  As I was perusing the menu, I wanted to order everything!  I couldn't decide what to get because they all sounded really good.  My shrimp and grits had plenty of shrimp ($13).  I did not feel ripped off, and there were 2 big pieces of bacon in it!  The portion was enough to share with 2 people.  The cinnamon biscuit with strawberry compote was perfect ($8). The 4 biscuits were not dry at all, and the compote was not too sweet.  They looked so cute - disc-shaped.  My friends who had Huevos Montulenos $12, Chicken Fried Steak $14, and the eggs benedict $13 thought their dishes turned out really well, too.  Everything pretty much had huge serving sizes.  I love that!  Next time I'll probably try the arugula salad or the pancakes..mm..  I really like the service here.  Everyone is so friendly and NOT stuck up, which is something I'm used to with a popular hipster cafe/restaurant.  The hostess was  accommodating, even though she had to get a manager to authorize seating us early..She was still nice about it.  Our server Marissa was nice and helped us quickly since we were in a rush.  I will definitely be back next time!
