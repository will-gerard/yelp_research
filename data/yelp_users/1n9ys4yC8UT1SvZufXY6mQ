Horrible, horrible place......rude management, lazy bartenders, stupid servers. The place literally stinks.......as for being an authentic Irish pub....me thinks not.....its about as Irish as a mexican taco stand and trust me i lived in Ireland for a long long time.....its as though they bought the interior from Irish pubs r us mail order catalog. Clientele are preppy student types with not a lot of gumption who easily buy into the faux "plastic paddy" facade.......if you want a real Irish experience i would suggest O'Connors on Dunlap or Tim Finnegans or Seamus Mc Caffreys in Downtown Phoenix......avoid this place at all costs.....pure and utter crap....

This little Irish themed community coffee house,tucked away in a strip mall in Queen Creek is quite the oasis in a parched landscape. Wonderful staff, great coffee and tea, wonderfully talented artists and musicians coming together every weekend to create a fantastic family atmosphere that everyone can enjoy. Bluegrass,folk,country and rock and roll to name a few. Do yourself a favor and make the short trip to Third Place Cup. You won't regret it...
