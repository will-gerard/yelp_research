The BK Lounge, as my colleagues have referred to it...Dane Cook we dem boys...is an absolute disaster.    I mean it.  Period.  End if discussion.  The only reason why I don't make it 1 star is because there have been some babes, that are struggling in this economy, and I know they're working hard for their money.  And if you've been following me on Yelp (hint: go check out my Little Chicago Pizza review) you know I always respect the star adage to any company because of babes.    So it's safe to say that Hooters will never get a 1 star from me.   So enjoy BK.  You win this round.  But when I become a Millionaire I will take the babes off of your hand, maybe take em out to a nice meal and a shopping spree, and I will give you your one star review.    Until then...Btw BK babes hit me up #BKBabes

No jokes on this review as the team at Brake Masters did a fantastic job of making sure I was fairly quoted for my back brakes, took me to work, picked me up and educated me on the steps they took to insure my confidence in the work they provided.    Best news is that they will replace my brakes for free (pay for labor work, only on the ones they replaced the 1st time.)   No pressure upwelling me on "additions" or "upgrades."    Way to go guys.  You earned this review.

They call this fine establishment The Good Egg.  Not A Good Egg.  Nay!  It's The Good Egg!  Let me give my fans the backstory of this review.  Ahem...  I use to Live with a 63 year old man I refer to as Smoky Joe.  Now this guy is old...like older than 15 presidents...that's old.    He'd teach me bout the whereabouts of aliens, how they visit us on Earth and why we need to find peace within the world in order for these intelligent lifeforms to finally reveal themselves.    He was also the best d#%m cook that I'd ever had the luxury of trying.  From fish with cheese perfectly flexed in the center to ribs that were so tangy and juicy that the meat would literally slip off the bone.  He knew his stuff.  Now we'd always go to this spot on Saturdays to catch up on my craziness as he'd cut out coupons for Albertsons and Fry's coldcuts (Albertsons coldcuts are a joke).    During this weekly event I'd always order the, Say Cheese, and play around with the options available to be put into my omelets (bacon, sausage, chicken, broccoli, etc).  He'd go for a single blueberry pancake and would smoke his cigs in between the wait time.  Wed enjoy some coffee and the fine service of the woman (no babes here, just strong independent woman.  Lets go!)  Overall the service was consistent.  The staff would get us some solid deals with their stamp deals per entrees and they'd treat us to hot hot coffee.    Other times they'd make a few mistakes, but all is forgiven if they'd hire more babes.    Here's to use good egg...you r The Good Egg  #Saycheese #Realwomen #Stampsonstamps

Holy moly this place is a chain smokers dream!  With a steady flow of tourists waltzing aimlessly around this paradise, you know you're gonna spend your money.    Now I'm not talking about the Casino (that's another story), I'm talking about heading to the top of Stratosphere!   With a 108 story journey to the top, you'll feel your pulse heightened at the idea of how high you're traveling in a sketchy elevator (it's a sketch zone for sure).    Once at the top you'll be amazed at the club like scene waiting for you just around the corner.  Its every cheating husbands dream as this spot is surely romantic.     Now go take your date outside, enjoy the view of Las Vegas.  You'll see over the horizon as the city lights up your soul to achieve big things.    However, if your scared of heights (like me), take a step back, its a long journey down.    In fact, there's rides that are hanging on the sides for the daredevils to ride.  I'll tell you what, it's borderline insanity.    But the most palm sweating experience was watching someone get suited up to jump from the top to the bottom on the ride that made my heart drop.    This place defines Las Vegas.    #Scenic #Paradise #RidesOfDoom #GorgeousWoman

Dr Liu, you know I gotchu.  This review is for the peeps that are frightened about hours of dental work.    Let's get into the meat and potatoes...the dental work.    I'd say the worst part about his practice is getting shots to numb your mouth.  It's not his fault he has to gingerly slide a needle into my gums.  I just hate needles.   Period.    But besides that he's my boy.  I mean his intellect in the most severe dental work makes the duration and days proceeding a painless experience.    Not to mention his assistant, Bailey, is an absolute doll.  Make sure to remind her to always bet on black at the casino.    Finally their estimations on the bills are fair.    #Wedemboyz

My man Duke runs this establishment and I'll tell you what it's just straight up wild.    Imagine it's your first day at college in the mid-west.  You've got your backpack slung over one shoulder, your hair is slicked to the side and you're wearing your best outfit for all the ladies to see (Burberry recommended).    During your 1st day you meet a nice girl named Gizelle from the most "interesting" town ever.  You both start talking and everything she says is about how she's a writer, singer, dancer, free-spirit, "student athlete" who's majoring in politics of blah blah blah and whatever she can make up, just for the guy to go..."whoa, me too."   Now at some point Gizelle decides to invite you to this get together she heard about because it's where all the students go to celebrate the big game.  You of course say, "Yes!  I'll meet you there!" (insert disbelief fist pump).   Now it's you're moment.  You head over there in your 2006 Mazda Hatchback that's the color White, because we all know that's a ride any girl wants to hop into, and you open the doors to a sea of red as fans are chanting Husker!...Power!   You begin to panic, "Oh man am I at a cult?  Where a Gizelle?  Why did I bring my backpack with me?  What is this place?!"  This my friends is called home.   They've got pitchers of the most fratboy like stuff, not that craft brew crap everyone seems to adore after college (eyeroll).  The wings are an assortment which vary from hot, spiced chili, bbq or my personal favorite; Radioactive.    Finally, if you don't know what a Shotski is then pull out your big boy pants, go hit on some babes (babes not always included, but it's pretty consistently included), go grab em out of their seats and enjoy the ritual we call Shotski.  You'll need 3 people (yourself included) for this ski that fits 3 shots from the left, middle & right.  Best part about this place is everyone is polite but when the Husker game is on, watch out!  So there you have it.  This review is for you Duke.  You're the man.    #HuskerPower

Shout outs to their Meatball Sandwich.  It's the meal that makes my tastebuds (and my feet) dance.   I'd even recommend heating that baby up the next day.  The sauce is gushed in the center of this carefully crafted sandwich and cut in half.  That means if you're full, just accept defeat because it aint going anywhere!   Now the reason why it's a 4 star is because my wait times always longer than suggested.  Not my fault I'm trying to make moves.    The fries are less than desirable.  I've been there twice and both times I end up throwing away my meal without finishing them.    Finally, the girl at the register.  Holla at me.    Leggo

Mimosas mimosas and more mimosas!  Sunday Funday can only happen at the one and only RnR.    Make sure you get here early as tables are reserved first thing.  The foods absolute trash but the scene is on point.    Shout outs to the babes who work here.  I'd say 7s all around but it's worth a convo after a few drinks.

Are you trying to rage your face off?!?!  Are you looking for ditsy woman with voluptuous figures to blow rape whistles vicariously throughout a fist pumping song?!?!  Did you ever think that Lord Disick would grace us with his presence at a sloshfest like this??  If so then get ready, because you're about to enter the place to rageface Fri/Sat nights & Sun mornings.  With music blast so loud you could hear it in the Grand Canyon, it's no wonder you'll look like a zombie the morning after because it's that wild.  The babes here at tops...I'd say if you go home w/ anything less than an 8 then you must of hit your head really hard on the side of the bar, got completely hammered or just have no game.  You want memories.  Go to El Hefe.  #BabesoftheBabes #NoCoverCharge #DanceFloorOnPoint #8'sAllAround

This place is a solid lunch spot.  Pull out your wallets and make it rain as the food is worth every dollar.    Obviously I'm a picky guy...single btw ladies so take notes, and I asked for a Croissant Breakfast Sandwich (hate mayo which pesto is created with...why an I here???) and you know what?  That shizzz was flavorful.  I said it, it was bangin.     The staff who took our 3 different orders down did not disappoint in creating the next Mona Lisa!   Shout outs to my fans.  The foods a pleasure to munch.  I want give a special shout out to my girl Clair K., earlier I had implied there were no babes at this fine establishment, but she has opened my eyes with not only her looks, but also with her witty humor and cool demeanor.    This is for you Clair.  #Munchies #ClairK'sABabe #realfood #realquick

For anyone who wants to hear about the bs I had to deal with this Saturday listen up!  This review is a shout out to the hypocrisy of their bouncers.    Saturday was suppose to be epic as Little John was in town and I had paid $20 before door prices.  Although I understand that there are 3 different lines to the front door (the normal paying person, the VIP line and the table line).  I was in the normal line, so I understand if anyone wants to "educate" me on raging in Old town, but news flash, I'm literally known as Ratchetman in Old town so save yourself some time.  Anyways, I was in line for 40 minutes, 20 of them we literally did not move and I was 2 people behind during that time before we could get in.    So I figured I'd ask the bouncer a few questions so I could understand the holdup.  At first he SEEMED fair with his explanation as he stated they were at capacity, which ok cool I get it.   But I kid you not 2 minutes later I see them let in 10...I repeat myself TEN PEOPLE...ALL DUDES in who just showed up seconds ago.    So I was livid.  Let him know that I saw what happened and I want an answer, but he got defensive as if my question was personel...well guess what!?!  I was taught if it smells like crap, looks like crap and taste like carp well then it's gonna be crap.  So there was gonna be questions.     After the situation started heating up he told me that even if the line moves he will not let me in...ok so now it's MY FAULT THAT YOURE A LIAR!?!   Congratulations you tool.  I go out at least 3 times a week to Oldtown and I will be telling my colleagues, no matter if it's a good friend or someone who's visiting for the weekend from out if state.    You wanna know what I'll tell them?  I'll tell the about Bottle Blonde, Hefe, The W, Cake, Beevy, Dakota...I'll tell them to go to Mill before I tell them to go to Maya/District (which from my understanding you work at too).   Why?  It's because your final words were, "have fun getting a refund online"  Well I hope you have fun explaining this to your boss when I find out your name

A few months ago my friend was having a raging party for his bday.  Before the festivities began Verdel recommended we go to this gem of a pizza place.    I'm a pizza guy.  Little Caesar's...trash, but it gets the job done.    But for that night it wasn't about getting the job done, it was about making memories.    The most surprising part about this joint is there was not a lot of people.  Good news for me.   Now about this place...ahem.  The scenery was on point as some of the staff members were babes (automatic star adage) .  The wait period was next to nothing as they went 0 - 100 real quick.    The pizza...ahhh the pizza.  Those square pieces were so tasty that it change my reality.   I am a better person because of this experience.    So check out.  If any of the staff members read this hit me up.  #babes #squareslicesofdelight

Restaurant was a 3 star.  The scene was...ite and the food was...ite.    But this review isn't for my experience...nay!  This review is a shoutout to the babes of the babes.  Her name is Carissa.   This server had golden blond hair with some serious volumn.  She was so babin that she could of done the minimum and still gotten my star adage (check out the BK Lounge review that I've written).  However she did her job with what I'd never tell one of my tinder matches, I call it authenticity.    Very professional, a straight up chill girl who made a Tuesday (going up?) With a friend who came into town enjoyable.  Carissa was 5 stars.  Hands down.   Give her a raise.  #TeamCarissa
