I love LUX's everything! It's a great place to enjoy a cup of coffee, study, or simply just hang out with friends for a chat. Their music and atmosphere is very hip (which I love). I go at least once a week for my fix. I love it here!

I have been to this CJ about 3x and the servers are very nice and attentive. Food is always hot and tastes great! I always enjoy my time when I go there. I love the chicken pot pie!!! It's the best!!! Oh and it's HUGE! Can definitely feed two people! I like the pleasant atmosphere. If you're out to have a nice quiet evening it's the place to be.

Blah! I wanted to know what all the fuss was about. I thought it was going to be great since everyone talks so highly of it BUT it's NOT! I won't ever return.
