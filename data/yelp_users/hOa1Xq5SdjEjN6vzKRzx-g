I stopped in to give them a heads up that me and some friends would be stopping by the next day on a bike ride (2pm on a Saturday), to which the manager flat out said we were not welcome. Huge blow and they missed out. I'd say better luck next time, but you not only lost me as a customer, but you lost all of our business that day and for the future.

I've played for over 6 years and in 3 different leagues, I can't say enough about WAKA! From parties to friends, trips to nights out on the fields, I've made the best of friends through WAKA and continue to play for all these reasons!

Very helpful & accommodating! Went in for shoes & socks; left with a free pair of socks & an additional discount for my place of employment.  Will definitely return!

She was fantastic! Called at the last minute for an eyebrow wax, she fit me in and was thorough and knowledgable. She introduced me to new (and healthy!) products and even gave me samples to try. I will most definitely be returning to this bubbly and happy gal!

This was an absolute blast! They answered all my questions promptly prior to our ride via email. And made our ride so much fun and relaxing. We will definitely do this again!
