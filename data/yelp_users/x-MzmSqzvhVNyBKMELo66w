By far one of the best Dental Practices I've ever been to. Dr. Milana is great and always puts me at ease anytime I've had dental work done. I've had a crown and cavity take care of by him and both have been perfect. One of the major reasons they get 5 stars is because of Tiffany, she has to be the BEST Dental Hygienist ever!! She knows how anxious I can get with every appointment and always does an amazing job to make me feel comfortable while I'm getting my cleaning. She also has the best choices of music playing when I come in and that is top notch in my book. I would suggest them to anyone, and I have since 3 of my family members go here as well.

I've now gone to this location twice and both times they have been sold out of most of their donuts and only had plain ones remaining. I've gone in the mornings both times when they should have donuts available. I know it's a new location so i'll cut them some slack but they should be ready to sell. For now I'll go to the Arizona ave and ray location and give this one some time to get ready.
