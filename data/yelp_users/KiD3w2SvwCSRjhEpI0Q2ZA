I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Cheese 'n Stuff. I had the Texan and my boyfriend had the Sicilian with double meat and double cheese.  Both Sandwiches were ample in size and more than enough for any human being. His Sicilian was monstrous. Everything tasted fresh and was FAR better than any sandwich you could get at a chain sub shop.   We also had the house-made lemonade (delicious) and both the German potato salad and traditional American Potato salad. I wouldn't buy any of these bound salads again. The German Potato Salad tasted like warmed, thin cut red potatoes in pre-made, store bought Italian dressing. Oh and it also contained bacon bits and was very vinegary and very sweet.  The American potato salad tasted EXACTLY like the Resers  potato salad you get in your local grocer's deli or amongst the other pre-made salads. Although it did seem they mixed it with extra yellow mustard. Same tangy miracle-whippy taste - same weird texture oddly toothsome potatoes. And little bits of red bell pepper. The macaroni salad also looked the same.  They did have an interesting assortment of sodas (celery soda,anyone?) along with the usual suspects.  And if you need a meat or cheese plate or both- they do that too!  This place is the quintessential mom and pop shop. Its great. Locally owned by a family who has had it for about 63 years.   We shall return!

I like Baby Kay's for a number of reasons  1.Its locally owned 2.Good patio 3.Friendly Staff 4.Exceptional happy hour deals. 5.Great Food!  I've had just about everything on the menu at one point or another and there isn't too much that will disappoint. The Gumbos and Jambalaya are delicious. The po boys are... Well, they're po boys. By their very nature they are just plain 'ol bread and seafood. Avoid the Shrimp Remoulade unless you REALLY, REALLY looooove horseradish and mayo.  The green olive slaw is fantastic and so are the hush puppies. Try the Lulu's wings if you like a spicy/sweet wing. The food overall is fantastic, comforting, well seasoned and filling.  The staff is knowledgeable about the menu and willing to answer any questions you may have. They are always friendly and accommodating. Quick they are not. But the food is outstanding and everyone is always so nice, I don't care that my dining experience is usually a little slow.  My boyfriend and I come here maybe once a month. Its in a great location and reasonably priced. Love this place.

The mind boggles. I don't even know what to say about this place. Where to start?!    I've lived in Phoenix for 6 years. Passing by Pete's a gazillion times, but I never stop because they only take cash and I never seem to have cash on me. Finally, one fateful day I decided to pull in and see what all the fuss was about. I was hoping for some decent fish and chips. What I got was something else.   I understand that this place is important for Nostalgia's sake. People tie memories to food and this place is a part of Phoenix culture. I get that people have gone to Pete's with their parents and grandparents.  At one time, this is what passed for good food. This hurts my heart.  Lets just lay it all on the table here; Pete's fish is pretty darned awful. The Shrimp (if you can call it shrimp) is mostly breading. About 2 ounces of breading with a quarter ounce of shrimp somewhere in there. I felt the need to dissect one just to see how much shrimp was actually present.   The fish is in patty form.  2012 and the fish is a patty. Its a rectangle. Its the filet-o-fish minus the cheese and bread. There is no rectangular fish in the ocean. What the heck is going on here?  I mean, I cant even put together a decent, well written review here because my mind cannot wrap itself around the fact that people LOVE this place. Its so bad.    The sauce is... I mean, really?! Its ketchup and Tabasco sauce.    Word is, Pete's has good burgers and I love a cheap burger . So I will try at least once more. But I won't be going for the seafood.

I'm always on the lookout for a good, inexpensive nail place. After consulting Yelp I found that this nail place had great reviews and is only a few minutes from my apartment! Sweet.  This place is very easy to miss. Although there is a large sign on the storefront, it just doesnt look like a nail salon. Keep this in mind. If you hit Thomas, you've gone too far!      I went in without an appointment on a saturday afternoon and the place was hoppin! I was greeted promptly and only had maybe a 5-7 minute wait. Tina was my girl. She didnt say much but was very friendly and gave me the best pedicure I've had in the 5 years I've lived in the valley. Two thumbs up for Tina. Seriously. I will be back to visit her.     I only went in for a pedicure but after perusing the menu, I would have had more done had I known their prices were GREAT! A Standard pedicure comes with the sugar scrub and is only $17. A manicure is only $10 and the combo is $26. The salon is very clean and  sanitary. Definitely worth every penny. Tina also gave me a pretty design on my toes for only an additional $4. These nail technicians dont just do flowers. The girl next to me had some VERY serious toenail artwork being done and I was impressed at how quicky and efficiently her girl moved without compromising quality.    Top Design isnt glamorous by any means but I had an exceptional experience there. They even do alterations! Couldnt ask for much more. So totally my new nail spot.

I'd never heard of this establishment before being invited here the other night. From the outside it looks cute. The exterior is covered in curtains. Like a living room; hence the name. Inside, its rather small. Its your typical wine bar - simila looking to Postino. I'm not sure how things go here on a regular weeknight, but I can tell you, on a busy saturday night, its a mess. At least that was my experience.   I was here attending a birthday celebration for a friend. They put her large party in the center of the bar area. With the DJ right in front . Oh and just a couple feet away was the bathroom. Which had a large line spilling into our area. Our waitress appeared to be trying her best to do her job but wasnt able to easily make her way around our table to take orders because the area was so cramped.   The wine list was pretty subpar. The cheese plate was, eh.    My real issue here was the Dj. I'm sure hes a great guy just trying to pursue a hobby. Or maybe his passion. Whatever the case may be, in this particular place he is playing the wrong music. If I'm at a wine bar I'm thinking of a place where people can talk while sipping wine. I think something ambient is a appropriate. Perhaps a live musician? I hear they have one on occasion. Something relaxing. This guy was playing full on booty bumpin tunes. There was no room to do the cupid shuffle so I'm not sure why he played it. He played the standard Chandler club tunes. From like, 4 years ago. The music was bad and severely out of place.   If this place wants to be a club, it should be a club. If it wants to be a wine bar, it should be a wine bar. But the two are not one in the same or even similar.    It was all underwhelming. I've lived in Chandler and I know the suburb is lacking in nightlife so I hope this place improves.

I came into this charming little establishment with a friend. We were sat pretty promptly and had drink orders taken. I had the iced green tea and she had water which was garnished with a slice of cucumber. I thought that was a nice touch.   We both started with spring rolls - she had the salmon, I had the barbecue pork. Both looked good and mine was tasty. Then we had both had a bowl of chicken pho. It was really tasty, however expensive for pho at $10/bowl.  That said,  the food was good. Not the best Vietnamese food I've ever had, but yummy just the same.   My only gripes were the little things. I've worked in the back of the house for a long time. So I know how much it costs to put this food together.  I just felt like everything was expensive for what it was. This is not a high end restaurant. Its a teensy little hipsterish Vietnamese place with minimal decor. Its a lunch spot essentially. My menu was printed on paper which is pretty commonplace these days so no big whoop. Unfortunately the menu looked like it had been used about 50 times. I understand re-using menus. Its totally common. To NOT do so would be environmentally irresponsible. It just looked really, really used and abused. Also, my dipping sauce ramekin had a huge chip in it. To be fair, I am hyper critical of EVERYTHING when it comes to service just because I come from a restaurant background.   Rice Paper gets 3 stars from me. It was eh... Luckily I had good company. I probably won't come here again though.
