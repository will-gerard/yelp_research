PB&B was surprisingly delicious! I would have never thought peanut butter on a burger would be delicious, but it's super tasty!! Their fries are crispy and taste like real potato. The second generation cocktail is really good and I can drink those all day!

AMAZING... let me start off with that.  So I originally made reservations to Ruth's Chris for my boyfriend's birthday dinner but I saw the menu for Capital Grille and immediately changed my mind and I'm so glad I did.  I made reservations on their website and mentioned it was my boyfriends birthday.  When we got there, the host and manager both greeted us and were very professional, wishes my boyfriend a happy birthday.  They let us sit at the bar for drinks before we sat down to dinner since the table wasn't ready yet. When we got to the table, there was a card signed by all the staff, happy birthday confetti that lined down the table it was wonderful.  The atmosphere was very welcoming, it was dim and very elegant but not overly done which I liked.  The bread they provided was warm and delicious.  We ordered the calamari for appetizer and let me just say... if you love calamari, THIS IS IT RIGHT HERE!!! its perfectly seasoned, breaded and crispy, and its mixed with banana peppers and tomato which give it a nice kick and some jazz. LOVED IT LOVED IT LOVVVVVED IT!  We then shared the porterhouse steak 28oz and it was delicious and perfectly cooked, a little colder than I would like it but at least they cooked it right.  We also ordered the lobster mac and cheese and paramasean truffle fries as our sides.  Way too much food for the both of us, we had to take half the steak, most of the mac and cheese and fries home but they were all delicious.  The service was amazing, our server was on point and very good, she knew the menu really well and explained everything to us.  The overall experience was a 10.  After our meal, the server came out with a slice of chocolate mousse cake with a lit candle for my boyfriend and it was on the house! They are so generous.  I'm a food junkie and I love food and this is by far my favorite, quality, restaurant.

I think I've been to just about every Thai restaurant around the valley from Thai Spices, Salla Thai, Thai Elephant, Thai Basil, Mint Thai, and Swaddee is by far the best I've had. Their food is always delicious and it's the perfect combination of sweet and tangy and spicy. The service is excellent as usually and the servers are attentive and super nice. I always get the pad thai, tom ka soup, or their pineapple friend rice (to die for). Their thai iced team and mango with sweet sticky rice are both amazing desserts to have after the meal. They have very reasonable priced lunch and dinner specials that come with a salad and egg roll. Their portions are very generous and I always have left overs. I highly recommend this place!

Came here with my mom and brother because we hadn't been there in a long while. it took 20 min to get our water order in when the restaurant wasn't even packed. I ordered the bleu ribbon burger and took two bites and found a hair cooked into the burger. it was gross and I lost my appetite as did my brother and mom. we walked out and I will never come back. the manager did a good job at apologizing and offering us free dessert and a gift card for next time, but I insisted I didn't need it because we won't ever come back.

Came here for happy hour with my best friend to grab some wings and beers. We were greeted and seated right away near the bar and had a big high top table all to ourselves. The server was really nice and attentive and got our drinks and food order. She saw my friend's ID first and then she asked for mine and looked at mine for a really long time, made a face, looked at my friend and back at my ID as if I had her ID even though she just looked at my friend's ID, and that was really annoying but whatever. I'm way over 21 so I don't know what her problem was. The wings were good and nicely sauced, the fried pickles were delicious too. Overall experience was really good except the server we had needs to be a bit more professional with the whole ID checking thing.

Thanks for your no service... We were seated and sat there for 15 minutes with not a single server to come by to get us drinks or our order. It wasn't busy at all and all the servers just stood around and when we stood up to leave is when someone came to follow us out apologizing for the not being attended to... Sorry it's a bit late. This location needs to work on better service

I see there hasn't been a review for 2014 for these guys so I'll be more than happy to start this off. The Nissan dealership recommended I get some things fixed on my car (dog bone motor mount cracked, oil cooler leak needs o-ring and gasket replaced, drive belt cracking). The dealership was expensive as hell and I'm poor so I looked around and called the top 3 rated mechanics on Yelp after reading all the reviews. Arizona Import Specialist quoted me similar prices as the other places but they were super nice on the phone and took the time to explain parts and the repairs to me. When I dropped off my car Monday morning, they had one of their guys drop me off at work which was super nice of them to do and my work wasn't really close by but they said it wasn't a problem. They called me in the afternoon to let me know my car was done and when I drove it home, it felt like a brand new car! I had this clunking noise that would happen every time I accelerated and that was totally fixed. These guys are good at what they do and I now know why they have 5 stars and all great reviews on Yelp. They've definitely won me over and I'll be sure to use them and recommend them for future automotive repairs.

Came here for the first time with my best friend to treat ourselves to some gelato. There were a ton of flavors and everything looked really delicious. There's not too much to say about this place other than it was really good. The girl working behind the counter was really nice and personable. I'll definitely be back for some more!

I don't always give one stars, but when I do, it's because they deserved it. Came here with some friends to celebrate Cinco de Mayo. Their mecheladas are really bad; watered down, no flavor. We ordered appetizers and they came out with our meal an hour later. The table behind me ordered a fajita plate and it came out sizzling hot and smelling so good, so that enticed me to order the same. An hour later, my fajita came out and there was no sizzling happening on that cast iron pan because it was sitting out in the kitchen waiting to be delivered to the table for a long time. The server kept forgetting our drink orders and we had to remind her several times. 5 out of the 6 people at our table asked for hot sauce and 20 minutes later after we had to remind her again, she brought out one little cup of hot sauce for the table that wasn't even enough for two people to share. We asked for jalapenos and they charged us $2 for it. We ordered a chimichanga and if I remember correctly at every other place we've ordered that it comes with green chili sauce and cheese on top of the fried burrito, but this one was dry, the meat and filling had no flavor. The white menudo was salty and really bad. This place is a sorry excuse for mexican food and we will NEVER, EVER, EVER, be back.

This place is really good and tastes better than the Garcias chain restaurants. My department comes here to eat every year after we volunteer at St. Mary's food bank and this place has great service, they're fast at bringing out the food, everything is pretty tasty and overall a good Mexican restaurant.

This place is pretty good when we don't want to drive to Ray and Rural to go eat and Swaddees (this place is the best). this place gets pretty packed during dinner on the weekends and service can be slow sometimes but the food is pretty good. tohm kha soup is good, panang curry, pad thai, and the hot and spicy noodles are pretty tasty too.

my family and I will never step foot in another Outback Steakhouse again. - it took 2 hours to eat and get out of there and there were only 6 customers in the entire restaurant - it took 40 min to get our onion blossom appetizer - their restaurant smelled like dirty, damp, rags - menus were sticky - ordered the steak and lobster dish and the size of the steak was smaller than the palm of my hand and I have small hands! - service was ok but the refills on water need to be worked on.

For a quick sushi fix, this place is awesome because you get to try a little bit of everything for cheap. We came around noon on a Sunday and it was super busy, the entire restaurant was full and there was about 20 people waiting. We waited for about 20-30 minutes and got to sit at the bar and from there it was time to dig in!! I like that you don't need a lot of service once you're seated because everything you need is infront of you, soy sauce, ginger, wasabi. They're definitely understaffed when it's busy though, there were only 3 servers for the entire restaurant.

My boyfriend took me here for an anniversary when we first met and then again for our two year anniversary and I love love love this place!! We chose to do the chef's tasting menu with wine pairing, it was pricey but totally worth it.  We got a total of 5 courses and each course was amazing, from the taste, presentation.  The servers knew so much about each dish and were so knowledgeable.  They were able to explain each dish and how it was made, what was in it.  The wines were delicious also, although I got pretty drunk by my 3rd glass and course meal.  The dessert was fantastic.  I did want a little more privacy but we were sitting by an old couple and surrounded by other couples.  The inside dining area was not that big but it was still nice.  The resort itself was beautiful to walk around.  and to top it off with a gondola ride and they sing to you, its just an all around great experience.

I really don't like giving bad reviews and I've had my fair share of delicious and really bad tasting pho. Today I came here with my family and ordered a pho chin (brisket) and my mom got the seafood pho... my goodness I might as well have gotten noodles in a bowl of plain water. The broth was disappointingly bland even with sriracha and hoysen sauce... we seriously had to reach for the salt. The noodles were kinds hard... Maybe it was an off day for them but I probably won't be back

This place is pretty good! we got a large pizza, half white sauce with garlic and the other half with pizza sauce with toppings. the pizza sauce was whatever but the white sauce was pretty amazing. we got the spinach salad which was also really good and well dressed and had nice portions of Gorgonzola cheese and bacon. The staff is pretty nice and the food was great.

I'll get to the point. Hostess: didn't look happy and never smiled once and couldn't find my reservation. Service: was seated at the back of the restaurant for a party of 8. took 15 min before we had to flag a server down to explain how we're suppose to start eating and took our drink orders. this really pissed me off, but after we got their attention, everything caught up to speed and we went and got our salads and the meats started coming around fast.  Food: the bread they give you is so so soo delicious, warm, soft, and sweet. their salad bar has a good selection of veggies as cheeses and other yummy sides. the meats were so tender and juicy and very flavorful. I wasn't too big of a fan of the chicken cuts, but the prime rib, lamb, house sirloin, and garlic beef were amazing. if you love meat, this is definitely a place for you. we were there to celebrate two birthdays and the server was very generous and allowed the two birthday girls to pick any dessert on the house AND allowed the other 6 people in the party choose between three different types of dessert, so everyone got a slice of cheesecake which was fluffy and delicious.

food was really yummy for my first time trying various Filipino food. the pork adobo was my favorite because the meat was tender and the sauce had a yummy tang to it. the halo halo special was an amazing dessert and the girl behind the counter helping us out was super sweet.

The lady owner/manager was nice and I really liked her, I will start with that.  I bought a groupon for a shellac manicure.  I've heard great things about shellac so I wanted to try.  When I arrived, the owner was there at the front and greeted me, and let me pick out my color.  I got my nails started by this one guy who was very gentle and nice and didn't make my fingers hurt.  Another customer walked in and the owner came to me and told me she would put me with someone else because the lady who just walked in already had an appointment with the guy I was with.  I move over and she yells back  and some other guy comes out to do my nails and that's when it all went downhill.  He made four of my nails bleed while scraping and pushing back my cuticles, so he goes and grabs a  little bottle filled with alcohol and this bottle has a drop top so he smears the top of the alcohol bottle onto my bloody finger and I'm thinking how unsanitary is this and how many other bloody fingers have touched the tip of this bottle? He goes on to do my nails and he didn't file my nails very well so there were clumps and jagged edges.  The nail clippers he brought out had like crusty yellow nail remains stuck on it but thank god my nails were already short and he didn't need to clip them.  As my nails were drying, I brought them up to my face to look at them and the guy comes and asks whats wrong so I point out the issues and he tried to fix them but I think he couldn't see very well because it didn't get fixed.  I had cotton ball lints that were on my nail that he just painted over.  I will not go here again. If you decide to go, I would ask for a lady to do it or ask for Tom.

I'll keep it simple! This place is quick, cheap, and delicious. They give you good portions for the price you pay compared to other vietnamese restaurants in the valley. This is always our go to spot for good pho and bun bo hue.

Clean restaurant- they remodeled and upgraded and it really looks and feels nice.  friendly staff- very genuine and nice. We felt welcomed and the server was very attentive. The food came out piping hot and the portion size is very generous. We got the dinner specials and had enough for leftovers. The Mongolian beef was really tender and flavor was good. The general tso's chicken was good too but different from what we're used to. The happy hour all day domestic beers for 99 cents is really good! We got a bottle of blue moon each which would normally be like $3-4 at a bar. Prices are decent and we didn't have to wait long for the food. Would definitely come back if we ever want Chinese food. Oh and they have sriracha and chili oil at every table which is nice so you don't have to wait for a server to get them for you.

Every time my boyfriend and I want a REAL burger, we come to The Grind! This place is seriously hands down, the best gourmet burger you'll put in your mouth. The size is beyond perfect, they always cook our patty to a perfect medium rare. The patty is seared and crispy on the outside, and soft and juicy on the inside. The sweet and spicy burger is our favorite because it's the perfect balance of sweet and spicy. The textures work perfectly from the crispy fried toppings, candied jalapenos, soft bun, juicy and tender patty. JUST AMAZING. Their mixed fries are delicious because you get sweet potato and herbed fries mixed in one container. The atmosphere is really nice and the service is always quick and excellent. I would highly recommend this place. We've tried burgers all over the valley from Fatburger, Delux, Modern Burger, Zinburger, and The Grind is hands down the best burger in town!

food was fresh and delicious and very flavorful. everything on the menu sounds great! we will definitely be back! prices are pretty good except for the fact that if you order their specialty salads, just be sure you can't get the same thing on the build your own salad menu because that is the cheaper route. we got the sweet thai chicken salad that was advertised as their special for 14 something, nothing special but it was delicious! but you could have built your own salad with chicken and same dressing and added more veg for only 10. we figured this after we got our food and was a little confused and annoyed but whatever.

I'll keep it short. Came here with a group of 8 for a birthday dinner. You would think a highly rated, nice Scottsdale restaurant to be pleasant to dine at. The thermostat read 81 but it felt like 85. Everyone was sweating all night and I could see people at other tables constantly wipe their foreheads. I asked the server if their ac was broken and was given the rudest look. He said he would see if he can do something but it was hot for  the entire two hours we were there. The server forgot our beer order. most of the table ordered a dish on the special menu that said it had crab, lobster, etc. but when we got the dish, the amount of seafood for the price was VERY DISAPPOINTING and the flavor wasn't anything special. The live band and the bread they give you was probably the best thing about this place. All 8 of us agreed we would NOT be coming back here..

I love this girl and I'm so glad I found her! The 5 stars are for a good reason and it's because she's great at what she does, super friendly, doesn't try and rush you, listens to what you're trying to achieve, and she takes her time. She's super funny and quirky and very personable. You truly get what you pay for and I didn't realize it until I came to see Laura. I'll admit she charges more than I'm used to, but when I went to those other places and paid half the price, I'd never come out happy. My first visit with Laura, my brows were a mess, bushy, thick, uneven, yeah gross lol. She listened to what I wanted,took her time and was super careful. She's won a customer for life! And I love my eye brows! Eye brows are everything because it can make or break your face.

I'll start with the worst part... We saw they had xiao long bao  which is a soup filled dumpling, and were so excited to order and eat them. When made correctly, it's delicious and juicy and amazing. The server said that they take longer to make and we were ok with that. About half an hour later they came out and they looked so sad and flat. All of the soup had spilled out before they even cooked it and it tasted like day old dumplings that were just reheated (look at the picture I posted of the sad and unappetizing xiao long bao). We also ordered the twice cooked pork which was pretty good, we would definitely order it again. We also ordered mapo tofu which was not good. It didn't taste like the mapo tofu you would normally find at a Chinese restaurant. We ordered the chongquin chicken which was like battered popcorn chicken sautéed in peppers and it definitely didn't taste like the delicious chongquin chicken we've had at Szechuan palace on 44th and McDowell. The server was really nice, she was an older lady and helped us order the popular tasty dishes she recommended. We did have to wait for a really long time to get someone's attention to get our check and pay.

I order their thai mango salad and enchilada soup every time I go and it's amazing every time I eat it. the ingredients are fresh and crisp and the soup is flavorful and creamy. it's the perfect lunch! and I love that they give you a chocolate covered strawberry with your meal as a dessert. my fave!!

I thought about writing a long review about my entire experience, but I'll just sum it up by saying that this restaurant is HORRIBLE. The staff is horrible, the food is horrible, and the wait to get food is also ridiculous. I wanted to try and look beyond the recent bad reviews this restaurant got but was that a huge mistake. I now know why they are rated so bad and why they will continue to be rated so bad. We wanted to order a tamale with our meal and our server grabbed one of the menus and pointed to the delicious, authentic looking tamale pictured on the menu and said "you see this tamale here? this is not what you're going to get here. This is food photography and is meant to make food look good. The tamales here are not good and I would not recommend them." At first I was pretty shocked that she would bad mouth the food there since she worked there, but was appreciative that she was honest if that were true. If it stopped there that would have been great, but then she goes on to say... "it's like if you guys were craving miso soup.." We stared at her in disbelief and I could not believe what this ignorant server was saying to me and my family. Then she continues on to say "wait, you guys are not Japanese I'm sensing... are you?" and I politely told her no, we're Korean. She then tries to save herself but we're already angry and tuned her out. 45 minutes pass and our food finally comes out. The steak in the ultimate burrito was so chewy like rubber and tasted really odd, the refried beans were watered down and gross, everything we ordered was drenched in cheese and sour cream and that's probably because the meat they use is not good so they try to mask it. Do not come here... there are millions of other Mexican restaurants that serve way better food and have don't employ ignorant people to serve customers.

I got a flier in the mail so I went to check it out and fell in love. the equipment colors are super bright and colorful but they were also brand new. the facility and all the equipment are clean and I always see the staff cleaning. I cancelled my la fitness membership and joined here because it was cheaper, cleaner, and closer to home. I am able to workout in the free weights area because there aren't a lot of people  or meatheads hogging the area trying to out lift one another and show off.  the treadmills and cardio equipment have personal tvs with directv channels which is awesome! I can walk and run and watch tv for hours.

My friend and I were initially at Oh Nails on Lindsay and Warner but they seemed short staffed and pedis were 22 so I called around and found this place and he said 18... sweet! We get there and they all said hi and seemed pretty welcoming. My lady was Tina and she was really nice, asked what I wanted and got a chair ready for me. She did a good job and didn't hurt my toes. I was wearing shorts and she was kind to get a towel to put over my legs and she held my purse while I got situated. I had painted on 7 of my fingernails to test out some of the colors and she offered to wipe them off for me. The standard pedi comes with hot stone massage and hot towels which felt really nice. I didn't feel rushed and the whole pedi took a little over 30 min. It was clean, they used tools out of new packages and cleaned after I was done. I will definitely come back to see Tina. My friend on the other hand, did not have the best experience with the other short haired lady who did her nails.

Piggly's is something I look forward to every year when I go to the Arizona State Fair because they have delicious fair food.  I saw that they were opening an actual restaurant by my house so I was really excited to check it out and get delicious, fried, fair food anytime I want.  We walked in and there was a large man at the door to greet us and he wanted to shake our hands and make funny talk.  The layout of the restaurant was a little confusing because you had to walk to the back of the restaurant to stand in a line to order your food.  The food prices were really expensive (e.g. $4 for an non-sweet corn, $7 for fried zucchinis).  The servers bring you freshly made potato chips on the house which were delicious. I would not come back because it's nothing great, the portions aren't great, the prices are too high.

Amazing, perfectly cooked, juicy, tender, quality steaks! I went here with a party of five to try out this new location. I didn't think this place would be that great and thought it would be comparable to like black angus or outback and let me tell you how wrong I was!  I'm pretty picky when it comes to steak, I don't like sawing off pieces of meat and I order my steaks medium rare and they never come out that way or it's just bleeding everywhere and still raw. we ordered the lobster stuffed filet and the ribeye and omg we were in heaven and could not believe how effortless it was to cut off a piece of steak and chew it. it melted in my mouth and was so flavorful and well seasoned. the service was great and attentive. I will most definitely come back again!

After watching the food network channel, my bf and I suddenly wanted fried seafood. We considered Long John Silvers, Pete's Fish & Chips, but wanted to try something new. After looking through Yelp, Good Guys Seafood stood out because they had good reviews and they were located pretty close to home and it was something new. The restaurant is very clean, bright, and spacious. We were greeted by a super nice and sweet lady behind the counter named Yolanda. The previous posts are true, she's super nice and very helpful. We got the fried oyster po boy and the 3 fried fish and shrimp plate. The food was really good, it came out piping hot and fresh out of the fryer.  I have to say that their fried shrimp was AMAZING! They were really big (we were pretty impressed), perfectly cooked, cleaned and de-veined, crispy, great flavor! I now know where to come when I want fried shrimp. The shrimp was seriously so good and everyone should go try some! The price for the food was very reasonably priced. Yolanda came and checked on us to see how everything was. Their fish was battered with corn meal and was really good. Their portion size is really good, and they gave me an extra fish and shrimp I think because it was my first time there. I would definitely recommend this place!

this place was pretty damn good! Me and the bestie met up for happy hour here and we were the only customers there for awhile but was quickly seated. staff was super nice  and the atmosphere was chill and not overdone. we ordered and shared the chorizo sliders, pork belly, harvest salad, and flatbread and WOW! everything was pretty damn delicious. the sliders were flavorful and seasoned well, the pork belly was thick and had great flavor also. The salad was delicious and so was the flatbread. their happy hour sangria was delicious and perfectly mixed, not too strong but still very tasty. my friend got the bunny slope martini and it was delicious too but a bit strong. the waitress was very attentive and noticed it wasn't being finished and she asked if it was ok and if my friend wanted a different drink. that was super sweet of her to ask because normally restaurants put out crappy drinks and don't care if you like it or not. overall this place was great and I'll be back! everyone should try this place, if their happy hour food was this good, I can only imagine how good their regular menu food is!

I remember this place being a Thai restaurant but that was definitely a long time ago. We came here with a group of 10 to celebrate my friend's birthday and when we got there our table was already ready for us. The servers were great and very attentive and also very personable and helpful. We had to split the check 5-6 ways and they were more than accommodating to that. The alcohol was great and we got my friend a handful of shots that were recommended by the server and my friend said they all tasted great. I got the JJ chicken sandwich and I must say that was probably one of the better chicken sandwiches I've had in awhile. The chicken was crispy and juicy, the sauce they put in the sandwich was really tasty and the texture and combination of everything was just really good! I got an order of friends which were really good, crispy, and well seasoned. I tasted the Salut fries that my friend ordered and they were also really good! if you like that vinegary, tarty flavor, you'll definitely like those fries. Service was great and atmosphere was also very welcoming and the restaurant was clean. My friend got a smores plate for her birthday treat which was awesome because it was enough to share with the whole table. The drinks sometimes did take a little longer and they forgot a few of our drinks, but it's ok, it happens. Everything that evening went pretty well except for when it came time to paying. The checks were not split correctly and drinks were on the wrong checks. The server had to take some of the checks back to correct them and when they were brought back to us, they were still wrong. It took a good while for the server to go back to the computer and update the checks and still drinks were missing from the checks. So we paid the checks "as is" because we were getting a bit annoyed. Then they later came back with separate checks for the missing drinks that they forgot to put on the initial tabs so that was also pretty annoying. Aside from the paying, everything else was pretty good and I would recommend this place and would want to come back to try their brunch.

I was really excited to try this place after seeing this restaurant on Man v. Food. I'm going to get down to the point. This place was totally not worth it. It took about an hour before we were able to order our food after being seated, My friend ordered a margarita and they failed to tell us that they did not have their liquor license yet and it was going to be a virgin margarita. I ordered their asada burrito with red sauce on top and it was horrible. There was barely any meat but a lot of fat and chewy pieces inside. I can honestly say that I've had a better asada burrito at Filiberto's. Our waiter was young but nice. I probably won't come back.

this restaurant is definitely a must try! the interior of the place was super cute, dim, rustic? the staff were very nice and attentive to our needs. we came for their moonshine and bacon board and let me just say that bacon board was AMAZING! it's 5 different kinda of bacon with cheesy bread and two types of jam to complement the bacon. the bacon were all distinctively different and so tender and flavorful. a must try! their house made apple pie moonshine was delicious! I didn't realize the other moonshine a were commercially bought and those were really strong and not too tasty. we also ordered the Mac and cheese and BBQ sampler for 2. the Mac and cheese was pretty delicious, very creamy and had a nice crust on top. the BBQ sampler was pretty good too but we were kinda full from the bacon board. the brisket seemed a bit dry and all the BBQ sauce tasted the same so it got hard to finish, but it does come with tortillas and a delicious coleslaw. the people inside were very chill, not rowdy or overly loud place, I'd definitely come back!

I've heard a lot of great things about this place and woke up early enough to go eat breakfast before the morning rush. We got there at about 7:30am on a Saturday and was quickly greeted by the host and taken to our table. We ordered the mmm mm mimosa and Bangkok bloody mary. The mimosa was good and very tart and gave me a nice buzz. the Bangkok bloody mary was very interesting but had a lingering fish sauce taste that I think most people might not like. We ordered the OMG french toast and the Reuben and the dishes were pretty amazing! the french toast was fluffy and soft and very flavorful. the corned beef was tender and delicious and I loved the soft pretzel bun! The décor is very cute and welcoming and we will definitely come back again to try their pancakes!

I'll keep this short and sweet. Came here expecting nothing great. The inside was very hipster and they had good music. The service was really good but it could be because they weren't too busy yet and they were only open for an hour and it was still early. Our server immediately brought out chips and salsa for us to snack on and the salsa was delicious! Well seasoned and really refreshing. I ordered the short rib, crispy fish, and carnitas tacos and wow were they delicious! The crispy fish and short rib tacos were really good but the carnitas wasn't all that great. There was a lot of meat in the short rib taco and the crispy fish was a nice size and had a great crunch. My boyfriend had a carne asada burrito called "the beast" and wow was that amazing too! The meat was tender and well flavored and the meat had a charred grill flavor to them which made the burrito super delicious! We had their mexican 75 cocktail and almond horchata with armaretto and those were delicious too! the drinks are on happy hour all day till 5pm and they were only $5. Overall experience was great and we'll definitely be back!

they have a pepper bar!!!! with jalapeño slices, pepperchinis, and baby peppers! this alone is totally worth coming here. the service was great, staff were super friendly and asked how the food was and came by to throw away our trash. teriyaki burger was delish and tender and flavorful! their fries weren't greasy and they were plump and crispy. I'd definitely come back

I really love macarons for their crisp coat, soft and chewy center... These macarons were crispy and hard all the way through!! The Nutella didn't taste like Nutella, and when I bit into the macarons the whole thing crumbled to pieces, there was no soft, chewy gooeyness in the center. I probably won't come back for macarons here.

This location is finally open and I can try their food!!! everything was pretty good for the most part. You can't really mess up chicken fingers or fancy them up. The chicken was crispy and tender and so were their fries. The chicken meals come with a garlic butter toast which was good but seemed a bit out of place ad everytime I took a bite of the toast I wanted spaghetti. The service was great, everyone there seems happy and energetic, probably because it's their first day open. It's a fast food joint but the workers came around and provided service like offering to take our trash and giving us refills. overall it's a pretty good spot if you're in the mood for good quality chicken fingers.

For a small hole in the wall Thai food place, this place was really good. We got dinner to go rather than dining in, but from the moment I placed my order over the phone, the lady I spoke to was so nice and wasn't one of those really mean, yelling ladies like at the other Asian restaurants (you'd understand if you've experienced this). When we came home, the food was packaged really well. We ordered the Panang Curry and Pad See Eu. The rice was shaped into an upside down cone in a separate container. The portion size was really good, the flavors were authentic. The Panang curry was not as peanut buttery as other Thai restaurants, it had more fish sauce and lime flavor, but was still delicious. The vegetables in the dishes weren't overcooked to death and they had a nice fresh crunch to them and not totally mush. I'd definitely come back again.

I've never tried the boiling crab in Cali, so I can't compare this place to that like many others can. but as for my first seafood boil experience... AMAZING! the seafood was fresh and everything was huge and didn't taste fishy or old. We got 1lb shrimp, 2lb snow crabs, 1lb mussels, order or oysters, and Cajun fries and my boyfriend and I had the biggest and best feast ever! all were seasoned with trifecta spicy level hot and omg delicious. service was great and food came out fast. love it!

All I have to say is the fatty brisket is life changing and so delicious. It melts in your mouth, so tender and moist like nothing I've ever had before. I crave it all the time. The two hour wait was well worth it!

Came here with my friend on a Tuesday afternoon to beat the Arizona heat of 116 degrees! We were craving mool nengmyun, so we came here for dinner. Mool nengmyun is a cold noodle dish with icy/slushy beef broth, buckwheat noodles, and topped with brisket slices, a boiled egg, pickled raddish and some other toppings. It's the perfect thing to eat on a hot and summer day. The restaurant wasn't busy when we got there and we were seated right away. When we ordered the server said they were out of it and we were so bummed and started looking for other restaurants that had nengmyun. The only other Korean restaurants that have mool nengmyun is Chodang (which is closed on Tuesdays), and Hodori, which is in Mesa and their nengmyun is ok, but they don't give you any meat in the dish and the portion size is smaller for the same price. A short while later the server came back and said that the kitchen actually has the broth and we were able to order it. I'm glad to know that they actually make their broth rather than use pre-made powder or store bought stuff. The mool nengmyun here is really good, great portion size, the buckwheat noodles are soft and chewy. Other restaurants tend to not cook the noodles long enough so it's a little harder and more chewier. The sliced meat was soft and tender and the broth was really refreshing. A lot of restaurants serve the broth cold, but this place served their broth super cold the broth was slushy with ice. The side dishes were really good and there was a good variety of banchan including sweet potatos, fish cake, cucumber, kimchi, etc. They also gave us this steamed egg side dish on the house, I'm guessing for the inconvenience of initially saying they didn't have nengmyun. I would definitely say this place has the best nengmyun in the valley and you get a good portion size and it comes with slices of meat (which Hodori does not give you in their nengmyun and I will never go back to Hodori to eat it because of that).  Our service was good, the manager or owner came by and asked how everything tasted. No complaints here and I will definitely be back many many more times during the summer to enjoy this super delicious and refreshing cold noodle dish!

way bigger and nicer than the other two locations in Scottsdale and Tempe. The parking is a bit tough during peak times. the staff were friendly, the juice as protein bowl was delicious and the amount of meat in the tri-tip bowl was more than generous. This location has a bar with beer, wine, mimosas. I was a little sad that they couldn't tell me what kind of muffin was in the muffin display and they even asked other employees and nobody knew. If you don't know what you're selling, how are you supposed to sell it? either way, it's a super delicious and healthy place to grab a bite and get delicious fresh juice.

Got there right at 5 when they opened for dinner service. The main server guy was pretty quick with giving us out menus and water and getting our orders so I didn't experience the slow service everyone is complaining about. I got the spicy miso which was good and my husband got this other ramen that was written as a special on the white board by the entrance called Jigoku ramen, which is way spicier than the spicy miso and has great flavor! (I highly recommend the jigoku ramen if you love spicy food). We got the chicken heart, chicken gizzard, and baby octopus yakitori and they were all pretty good with good flavor. You have to eat them when they get to your table and not yet them get cold because it's not as good. I probably won't get the heart again because the texture is pretty different. Prices are good, waters were filled, food was great! Can't complain here.

The Korean chili sauce is good... The chicken would be good if they would cook the chicken right. We saw previous reviews of this place serving raw chicken, so the first thing I did was cut into the thigh and dark red juices start gushing out and the chicken is raw. My fiance's chicken thigh was also raw. I took them back and the cook had the nerve to say that the blood is from the broken bone of the chicken. First of all... I don't see any broken bones on my chicken and I've had enough chicken I my life to know that this isn't safe to eat but he reassured me it was. They made a new batch for us and the new ones looked better than our first ones but still really pink. Their donuts weren't anything to rave over, we got the PB and the red wine and they were eh. We won't be coming back.

The parking to try and get here really sucks but then again, anything downtown is hard to get to, especially finding parking. We came here for a friend's birthday and it was a party of 10-12 that he reserved. They put us in this tiny room that comfortably fit maybe half of the reserved amount of people. The decor of the place is really nice, very sleek and clean and modern looking. They have good music, I'm thinking it was Polish music but I enjoyed it. They for some reason decided to turn off the ac in the room we were in so it was super hot and we were all sweating and had to call our server over to look into it. The perogis were not good and I really tried to like them. The texture of the meat perogi was hard to oversee, it was like puréed mush for meat and just didn't taste good at all. I tried some of the other varieties my friends got and those weren't very good either. Costco often times has a perogi vendor come and let you sample them and I'd have to say those tasted way better than the ones this place served. We also ordered the sliders which were also not good. The patty was dry and the cheese was just placed on top of the patty and wasn't even melted on, it was cold, hard cheese. Their food was definitely disappointing. Their French fries were good, they were thin and crispy and I enjoyed them. The drinks on the other hand were really good!! I got this polish lemon beer called Warka and was kind of nervous to try it because I wondered if the beer would be sour because it was a lemon beer but it tasted so good! It's sweet and refreshing and is now a definite favorite. The percentage of alcohol is very low, but I still got a little buzz from drinking it. We also got another beer that was similar to a Guinness and that was also really good. Their mixed drinks were also good, so I'd say this would be a good place to come for a drink, but I'd recommend to skip the food. The server was nice until the end when we decided to go outside and sit by the fountain. Someone in our group asked if she could wipe down the chairs because they were wet from the fountain and the server said, what's the point? It's going to get wet again. That may have been true, but it would take some time before it got wet and at least we could sit down in the meantime. We probably won't ever come back, but I'm glad I came for the experience and found myself s favorite beer!!

I thought all of these 5 star reviews for this brand new restaurant were fake because it just didn't seem real, so I decided to check it out myself with my brother during lunch time. The restaurant was very clean, the owners and server were very nice. The sushi was super fresh and you can really see and taste the difference in the fish. The owner, Jennifer, was very personable and I felt like family after talking to her for 10 minutes and even got a hug goodbye! It's hard to find business owners you can connect with like that. She has a passion for this business and takes pride in the freshness she offers at the restaurant. The prices are very reasonable and the food came out very quick. I'm excited to have this awesome sushi restaurant move into the neighborhood!! I will definitely be back!!

Came here with my husband and two friends on a Friday night at 5:50, waited and was seated at 7:10. The wait wasn't too bad since we expected it and we were able to stand inside and grab a beer by the bar. We ordered the large malnati classic deep dish, hot wings, and the family size malnati salad. The salad was great and had nice big chunks of cheese and bacon and the dressing flavor was really good and well tossed and mixed into the entire salad. The wings weren't anything special but the sauce was pretty good and we enjoyed them. We were all so excited to try this famous maltani classic deep dish pizza and when it came out and we tasted it, it was really disappointing. The pizza wasn't hot with stringy cheese and tons of sauce, but was rather flat and the crust was wet and doughy. We asked our server if the pizza was supposed to be like that and he looked at it and said it did look under cooked and went to grab a manager. The manager came and looked at the pizza and said that's what the pizzas looked like and pointed to the soggy dough and said "that's all the sauce right there", but it wasn't saucy, so we weren't sure what exactly she was talking about. The atmosphere is really fun and inviting. The pizza is really nothing to rave over and if all the pizzas tasted like the one we ate, I'm really not sure why people like this place for pizza. Not sure if I would come back because this was a real disappointment. I was hoping for something better than Pizza Hut, but what we got today did not leave a lasting impression

I love that we're getting so many more Korean restaurants in the valley! I came here with some friends to check them out and they're located in a pretty good spot in Mesa in a new Asian plaza. The restaurant is pretty big and spacious which was nice because I hate sitting at a restaurant where another table is so close they can pretty much be part of your party. They had a good selection of food and they give you a ton of banchan (side dishes). I got the yookgaejang which is a shredded beef, spicy soup. It was spicy and had good flavor and seasoned well. The meat was really tender and it was probably one of the best yookgaejangs I've had in the valley. My friend got this fish roe soup and that was also really good and had good flavor. All of their soups were really good and I would highly recommend this place if you're looking for a Korean restaurant in Mesa.

FYI so you don't get yelled at by the rude white girl with glasses that works the line. if you get a large bowl and get "half and half" which is half rice and half salad to start the bowl, it apparently comes in a bigger clear plastic container that's not listed anywhere, but they expect you to know this and they pack half the container with rice enough to feed 5 people. SERIOUSLY WTF was her issue? She started packing the rice in the container and I simply asked "which size is that one? I just wanted the large bowl" and in the rudest, snappiest attitude, she goes... "You said half and half didn't you??..". Ok.... I did but I didn't know it came in a giant container and I didn't know it came with 5 scoops of rice. Work on your customer service PLEASE. Other than that, the owner was pretty nice at checkout and the food was good.

We came here after seeing their Facebook promo for a free bowl on June 4th, so we stopped by to check them out. The atmosphere and decor is really clean and welcoming. The staff was nice. I got the pad Thai with pork belly and my husband got the ramen with pork belly and we also got their taro smoothie. The taro smoothie was super delicious! Very creamy and sweet and had good taro flavor. They had just added more liquid in the machine to make more so it was more of a drink than a smoothie because it didn't have time to freeze into a smoothie when I ordered it but the flavor was pretty good and I'd definitely be back for that. The food on the other hand was pretty disappointing and we will probably not be back. If you're looking for authentic Asian flavors, this is not the place to go unfortunately. The pad Thai was very bland and watery and there was equal amounts of bean sprouts and shredded carrots as there were noodles. The flavor was truly lacking and the texture of the noodles are definitely not what you would get at a Thai restaurant. Their pork belly was wayyyy dry and overcooked and shriveled into jerky-like strips. Their ramen broth was really salty and just tasted like canned broth and wasn't anything great. I did like the way they cooked the egg, it was medium cooked and still had the gooey yolk center. The lady next to us ordered the pho and when we saw the bowl and portion size of it, we were glad we didn't order it because it was so small and there was hardly anything in there. You can go to a Vietnamese restaurant and get a huge bowl of pho with tons of noodles and meat for under $7 bucks, so to come here and see the portion size and ingredients in the bowl that made up the pho, we were super shocked. Their spring rolls were like 6-8 bucks and the menu didn't even mention any meat being in there and it was like an additional $2 for shrimp to be added in there. You can get bigger spring rolls with meat and shrimp at a Vietnamese restaurant for under 3 bucks!! If you're looking for authentic flavors with good portions, this is not the place unfortunately. It's very Americanized and lacks flavor and spice. I knew this the moment I walked in as there weren't any Asians working behind the counter. I'm sure there are plenty of people who would enjoy this place, but it just wasn't for us.
