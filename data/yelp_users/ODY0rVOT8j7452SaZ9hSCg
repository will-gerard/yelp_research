Just walking in here you know it's going to be all home cooked food. The chicken fried steak was the best I've had in years. Friendly staff, great local place. Highly suggested.

I play in Lost in Lies very often at Joe's Grotto next door to here, so every show night my band eats here before the show. They always take fantastic care of us, almost always with a table of 7 or more with split checks. The food is hot and fresh, the Chili paste is deliciously spicy, everything is just the way it should be. Highly suggest garlic chicken and house special beef.

Put in a catering order to feed our team at work (7 guys with BIG appetites) we got the #1 catering combo with 1.5lbs brisket, 1.5lbs pulled pork, 1.5 lbs mashed potatoes, and 1.5 lbs cowboy beans. Added on 1lb Chopped chicken and 1 dozen soft rolls. We ordered for same day pickup, and it only took them about 20 minutes to put that all together, which is impressive.  I now have 7 happy team members, with 7 full bellies, and NO left overs. All of the meats were fantastic, so were the sides. I'm generally a tough critic on barbecue because I've spent a lot of time back east eating delicious bbq, and this absolutely did not disappoint.   I can't say which of the 3 meats I liked better, as they were all 3 astounding.   I will definitely be eating here again, and I'm definitely going to have to check out their all you can eat first Wednesday of the month like all the other reviews here suggest.

Fried okra was fresh hot and delicious, pulled pork, beef, and chicken were all served cold, so was sauce & beans. won't return.
