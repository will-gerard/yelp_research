I found this gem recently and fell in love with the variety of quality fresh produce and the fact that its definitely less costly then the regular grocery stores...um winning!!! Very organized and clean store with an awesome bakery and food market area I haven't got the chance to try yet.  This will now be my staple for yummy fresh produce :)

Had one of the best tuna sandwiches here!  I have been wanting to check out so I popped in for lunch and was pleasantly surprised at the prices and fair variety of locally grown produce as well as bakery goods, jams, and other goodies.  The debit card dollar charge didn't make me happy but the sandwich gave me temporary amnesia lol I will definitely be back with cash!:o)

I was pleasantly surprised that food was hot and delicious each time.  I enjoyed the combo rice minus pork, kung pao chicken and shrimp and the orange chicken made spicy.  My  friend had the beef and broccoli said it was very good.  I don"t live that far away yet delivery really takes the 35-40min wait they say...I like to think this has a lot to do with the hot fresh made when you order factor:)

Three carne asada street tacos with cheese and the green salsa make me very happy!  Tried other items but I always go back to the tacos so im now in a committed relationship:)

Don't really care for buffets for personal reasons but this one doesn't creep me out as much and the food also very good...the crabs legs bring me back:)

I have now been here quite a few times and enjoy it just as much as the first time! I experienced mostly Thursdays and just a couple Saturdays.  The band and music make it a great place to grab a drink and enjoy a night out of dancing with your special someone or group of friends.

Really had bad impression from first contact just from the rudeness on phone.  If my home warranty hadn't set up an arrangement I would of never used them, but the actual service with LT was the opposite experience

I have been a couple times and already one of my faves!  The rotisserie chicken with bread pudding and vegetables, pork tenderloin and cheese grits, crab cakes, kettle green chile, green chile mac n cheese, and even the bread the serve are all excellent choices!  Also very pleased with the huckleberry margarita:)  Service and ambience very good, nothing bad to say to date.  Can wait to try happy hr!

I am just now discovering this cool spot even though this is just a few hops and a couple skips from work. I went with a group of co-workers for lunch and we had great service.  I had crab cakes and clam chowder both delicious!  Alot of yummy options on lunch menu.  I like the atmosphere and look forward to coming back to enjoy the patio area when it cools down.

I went to Firesky for spa week with a few co worker/ friends...I chose a massage and was pleasantly satisfied with my session.  Great attentive staff and such a beautiful resort, it's right across the street from my fave restaurant Roaring Fork! I can't wait to come back

I tried this place once on a whim as carry out, not sure what the menu name of dish but the description said yogurt chicken also came with fresh naan....ohh my yumminess very spicy and flavorful!  Felt I really scored with this whimsy adventure.  Took me awhile but made it back twice for the lunch buffet and have been very pleased with the selection.  Even though my carry-out and lunch buffet both good experiences I have and will definitely recommend the lunch buffet because if I hadn't gone for buffet wouldn't of discovered they had SO many delicious items available!  The place is clean and blue..lol and the service friendly yet a bit stale.  I do plan on going back again soon:)

I had the pleasure of dining in old town Scottsdale at Mission.  Very quaint and modern Latin.  The food was quite yummy, I had the tostadas before my maui maui tacos and fresh guac and chips oh yeah and sweet potato fries:) I had too!  Everything was fresh and delish and  I will definitely make it back for the pumpkin bread pudding dessert  I didn't have room for.  Mission is one of my new favorites!

Been here a few times and happy to see how well it has grown.  I was very impressed with the enhancements to ladies night on Thursdays.  I was greeted by a nice gentlemen host who presented me with a rose and showed me to a table of yummy hors d'oeuvres that included fresh fruit, pretzels, chocolate fountain and shish kabobs.  He also told me they were doing manicures for five dollars at the back of restaurant as well as massages!  I joined my group of friends and we enjoyed appetizers, drink specials and the awesome live band and as if that wasn't enough they had the gentlemen host come around with complimentary specialty shots throughout the evening.  Only thing I could suggest is getting the word out to the handsome gentleman who would appreciate ladies night, especially since Michael's Cafe is doing an exceptional job putting the ladies in great spirits.  I also think its a great date night for the lovely couples.  All in all another fun night at Michaels Cafe:)

Great spot for an easy hike!  I also like to run the stairs on McDowell side.  Parking is limited by the stairs
