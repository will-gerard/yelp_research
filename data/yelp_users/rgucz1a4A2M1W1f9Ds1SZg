The food here was fantastic!  Thank you yelp reviewers!  The Bloody Mary was super spicy, just like I like it.  The artichoke, kalmata omelette was bursting with flavor!  The staff was personable and knowledgeable.  Definitely going back.

Not cool!!!  I've only ever visited the Phoenix location and had outstanding food and service. Tonight has been COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE!  We were entertaining clients and the experience couldn't have been worse. I made the reservation for 11 a week in advance. We arrived at 6pm and had clients who had to catch planes at 9pm. It took more than 45 minutes to take our order.  At 8pm after repeated requests on the status of our order and communicating that we had travelers on a tight schedule we were told that one of the entrees was burned and it would take longer.  When we then asked to speak to the manager so we could explain the situation, we were given nothing but attitude. At that point we had had enough and got up to leave.  The owner met us at the door and threatened to call the police if we didn't pay the bill. He then offered to give us $200 in gift certificates. Hmmmmm.... Why can't he just accept his mistake and take care of the bill?  At least we would have given this place a second chance. Instead he refused to provide customer service and told us not to tell him how to run his business!  As we stood outside and argued with him for 15 minutes, 3 other parties left and told us it took over 2 hours for them to get their food. Come on people!  I understand that mistakes happen, but for crying out loud just fix it!!! I will NEVER set foot in this place again, and I'm guessing neither will the other 30 people who exited along with us.

The menu is crazy genius!  What a creative mix of flavors!  My husband had the Apricot BBQ feta chicken sandwich on ciabatta bread and I had the Amsterdam Pasta with truffle oil and aged Gouda - yumm!!! Don't miss the crunchy panko crusted Brie with habanero honey! Great service, casual yet current atmosphere and reasonable prices. The back patio is super cozy!  Love it!  Can't wait to go back!

Thank you Yelpers!  I didn't know where to begin and your reviews were spot on!  All my husband wanted for his birthday was a car detail.  Given that his car is a bit older and he had his own mobile detailing business 30 years ago - I new that the quality or work would need to be amazing - and it was!  Scott responded to my email the same day!  He was professional and easy to work!    My husband was incredibly impressed!  The worn leather seats look brand new!  Now he wants to restore the headlights and rims!  Oy! :)  Thanks Scott!  We will definitely be recommended and using your services again!

After four HORRIBLE and unique service requests from Grace Plumbing (through AHS Warranty), we finally found a winner!  When the pipe under our kitchen sink busted, I insisted AHS send out a different company this time.  Alan's Plumbing answered the phone on the first call (no 20 minute hold time), their scheduling coordinator was very helpful in getting a tech scheduled the same day.  I was notified 30 minutes before the tech arrived.  He was punctual, professional and very efficient.  After 20 minutes my sink was good as new.  Very pleased with this plumbing company.

Hello!  Can you say awesome!!!  Stumbled upon this place while looking for a quick lunch before a Sunday matinee. Yes, the pretzel roll with provolone fondue is to die for!  But be careful, it's a large order and will fill you up quickly. My friend had the sweet corn cannelloni which was tasty and wonderfully unique, while I had the apple, currant, blue cheese mixed greens. The variation in flavors was outstanding and I especially loved the paper thin mandolin sliced green apple.  We both agreed this would be the perfect place to come to on a lazy Sunday afternoon; indulge in some good wine and go crazy on the separate, and vast, anti-pasta menu. Some proscuto, olives and a distinctly aried selection of cheeses. Yumm!  We arrived at 11:15am and by 12:00 the place was completely packed. Great atmosphere. Love the long bar, open kitchen and super cozy/comfortable seating. Well done.

Yummy!!!  Just found this place today. We were told they have been open for about 6 months. Everything is fresh and made to order. I had the veggie burger on wheat, which was not even remotely dry (wow!) and the avocado made it more excellent. My friend had the Albacore sandwich (not breaded-yay!), which was firm, juicy and not fishy!  My daughter had the Chicken Cobb salad which was a nice size (not huge, not tiny) and the chicken was REALLY juicy also. My son had a double cheeseburger which tasted just like a fresh burger should taste. Moist but not too greasy. The bun was SUPER soft. Go for the sweet potato fries.  Also, All the nutritional info is on their website. The tuna sandwich is only 390 and the veggie burger is 470. We'll be back.

My 7 year old (who is slowly becoming a sushi fanatic) and I dropped in here tonight after an early movie. I would agree with earlier reviews that there is little to no ambiance. However, the Sushi was excellent AND very affordable. Though the menu is fairly extensive, we stuck to the basics and had shrimp nigiri (no brainer), 2 lobster rolls (excellent), a Caterpillar roll (fighting over who got the last piece), edamme, 2 glasses of a decent Chardonnay (for me, not my daughter) and finished off with some white rice strawberry ice cream. . All of this was just $48 and tasted great!  I don't think it hurt that we sat at the sushi bar and watched the Dbacks win in extra innings. :) Me thinks this will become a regular sushi hang out for us. Good sushi, good service and good prices.

Really like this sandwich shop! The selection and amount of options are huge!  They are a small mom and pop and everything is made fresh so you will need to wait a little, but it's worth it! Over 150 pre-made options and you can customize any of them. We have been here only twice, but we plan to keep coming back. Enjoy!
