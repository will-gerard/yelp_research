Here's a nice story for you. I've ordered pizzas online through zpizza in the past, so they had my contact information. They sent me an email containing a coupon for one free pizza on my birthday, which was coming up shortly. I went in to redeem my coupon later on a weeknight. One of the two employees working at the time told me that since the coupon came from their corporate office in California, I would have to go there to receive my free pizza. What a jackass. He was a young, hipster-looking guy. Pretty sure he was wearing a backwards baseball cap.  LOCATION: Only good thing about the place, it's downtown. Good atmosphere. PRICE: Too high for everything. Pizza's expensive, beer's expensive. SERVICE: Did you read my story above? Every other employee has been pleasant, but this guy really made me angry.   I cannot recommend zpizza because of the terrible experience I had there. I steer all of my friends away from this place. Better experience at Brooklyn's NYC Pizza or the new place that just opened up, I forget the name. Both are located a couple blocks from zpizza at 2nd Street and Washington.

I have had a great experience with Bulwark. Our tech Lance showed up on time, listened to the pest problems we have been having recently, and quickly sprayed local areas. He answered all of my questions. Great service!

I'm surprised at the negative reviews. Granted, I have only been to The Strand once, but I received great service and great food. Their happy hour specials are amazing. I got the best burger I've ever had in Arizona, along with delicious parmesean garlic fries and a beer, all for $10 plus tip. Truly a great deal, especially for happy hour.
