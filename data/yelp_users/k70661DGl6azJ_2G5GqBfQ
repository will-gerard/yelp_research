I started coming here a few years ago. My husband and his family have been to this practice for decades, and I am so glad to be a patient, as well. I really like Dr. Mastores and all the staff. Everyone is friendly and knowledgeable, and they always answer any questions that I have. They have great equipment and everything is very clean and up-to-date.  Even during a recent computer outage, I received an email about the outage and then called before my appt to confirm that they could see me (they could). They were very upfront about the outage and that they were running a little slow, which is understandable. My appt actually didn't take any longer than usual, I just had to wait a few extra minutes to settle my bill.   I have recommended this practice to several friends, and they have reported back that they had good experiences, as well. I would recommend this practice to anyone living in Phoenix who needs a reliable, professional eye doctor.

Last Christmas I bought a beautiful Jason Hill print (the Phoenix Financial Center, if you must know). I needed to get it framed to give to my boyfriend and I knew I couldn't take it to Micheal's. After searching a bit on Yelp! I came across some great recommendations for Framin Works.  The gal who helped me (Catherine - sp?) was very helpful and she took the time to get a good sense of what I was looking for. I am not well-versed in the art of framing, nor do have a particularly good eye for what makes things pop. She helped me pick the perfect frame, double mats, and even ordered a special mat for me! I was a little uncertain about the frame at first, but it turned out beautifully and my boyfriend love Love LOVES it!  The cost was very reasonable for framing and they even had a first-time-customer coupon on their website.  The next time I need something framed, I will take it to Framin Works.

I have been going to Sunflower for over 5 years, but I made the switch to exclusively Sunflower shopping about 2 years ago - and I'll never go back!  I used to hate grocery shopping, shoving my cart through loads of people, trying to avoid the displays full of tempting, unhealthy foods... ugh! Now I love it! Sunflower doesn't feel like a grocery store, but more like a market. The aisles aren't crammed together as close as possible and the produce is obviously the focal point of the store.  A few things I could never do without: - Freshly made pesto (as good as homemade) - Wheat pizza dough - Cascade fresh yogurt - Fair trade and organic coffee by the pound (and there's no douchebags grinding the disgusting flavored coffee in the organic grinder) - Dr Praeger's veggie burgers - Sunflower multi-grain bread - Double ad Wednesday  Additionally, Sunflower has scads of inexpensive, store brand canned and boxed items that seem to increase every week. They have a pretty good wine selection (at least for this occasional wine-drinker), and a great beer selection for a grocery store.  There are probably dozens more things I could list, but I don't have all day! Just one more thing: I have actually spent less on groceries at Sunflower since switching away from Fry's and Bashas! I can eat healthful and even organic food for cheaper than a regular grocery store! It's almost too good to be true :)

If you love hanging out in the Roosevelt District, then you will love the Lost Leaf.  It's tucked away on 5th St just south of Roosevelt in a historic old house. They've torn out the ceiling and left exposed brick in places, giving it an amazingly open atmosphere despite the small space.   The beer selection is incredible, although there are no beers on tap. There's nearly always live music; I prefer the jazz groups over the louder sets since the building is so small.   I heard a rumor that they are trying to expand the patio area and add draft beer - that would make it perfect!

I was really excited when this place finally opened. I decided to go there for post-drinks munchies on my birthday, since it's open 24 hours.  Some of my friends opted for breakfast, and my boyfriend and I opted to split some buffalo wings and a burger.  The breakfasts looked dreadful, eggs looking up from their plates all sad and pale... and it seemed like every side order came quite a while later.  My boyfriend absolutely love buffalo wings. I mean LOVES buffalo wings. He love them so much he once drank the leftover wing sauce from a take-out container (much to the chagrin of his stomach). So we thought we were in for a late-night treat...   The wings came out with no sign of sauce, not even a light coating. We were hungry so we tried them anyways. I don't know how they did it, but somehow the wings were both charred and slightly undercooked. Whatever kind of "spice" they used on them was burnt beyond recognition. And again, NO SAUCE!  I think that my burger was more salt than burger. (I've heard rumors that terrorists have been sneaking into American kitchens and pouring salt in the food to kill us slowly, so maybe Sally's is a victim?) I've eaten terrible burgers, even ones at Applebees, but this one was absolutely inedible - even in my slightly inebriated state.  My roommate ordered the Navajo Taco, but that soggy, bland excuse for the real thing was also too horrible to eat. I hope that Sally's Navajo Taco meets up with a State Fair Navajo taco in a dark alley in South Phoenix...  I hope that after their summer vacation, Sally's hires new kitchen staff - right now I would only recommend it to people I hate.

Worst. Brunch. Experience. Ever.  EVER.  Hubs and I wanted to try a new brunch spot and boy were we surprised!  This place is LOUD. LOUD. LOUD. It was 1pm on a Saturday and there was a DJ. I've been to brunch w/ a DJ before, which is generally pleasant since a good DJ would understand that Rhianna on 11 is not appropriate for broad daylight. Maybe I sound like a grandma, but I felt so sick to my stomach from the thumping bass that my brunch didn't sit well.  The service was quick, although I had to literally SHOUT at our server. The food tasted good and came out really fast. These are the only reasons I will give away 2 stars.  The parties at adjacent tables were shouting so loudly and obnoxiously that I ate my eggs and potatoes at light speed to get out of there ASAP.  If you want a club atmosphere 24/7, come here. If not, stay far, far away.

I bought a Groupon for this place a while back and hadn't gotten around to using it - then my birthday was here! What a great excuse to go out on a Wednesday!  So, went to Centurion last night with the boyfriend for my birthday. We had made a reservation, but there really wasn't any need to since there were maybe 5 couples in and out while we were there. It's a very small space and we sat out on the patio in the lovely evening weather (can't believe I did patio dining for my Feb birthday - but that's Phoenix, eh?).  The beer selection was small but interesting, however the one we wanted was not available, so we chose a bottle of wine from Bordeaux (for $21!). We ordered the strudel since it sounded adventurous and was it ever delicious! We chose to split the Gnocchi with Shiitake Mushrooms and Dijon Cream sauce and the White Truffle Pizza. The Gnocchi was perfectly tender and the mushrooms were delicious in the cream sauce. Very rich but not too heavy to split. The pizza was so tasty and I am now slightly regretting letting the boyfriend take the leftover half with him to work today!  The dessert was the icing on the cake, so to speak. I love tiny sweets, not gigantic slices of cake - especially after a fairly rich meal. They served us a tiny espresso cup made out of chocolate, filled with espresso mousse, with a bit of blueberry reduction. DIVINE! I love the chocolate and espresso combo, and the presentation of it with the edible cup was adorable!  All in all, a very pleasant experience with attentive service, great presentation, and delightfully tasty food. I can't wait to try their brunch!

I don't think my previous 3-star review was the downfall of Mr. G's, but now that it's gone, I miss it sorely!  I would love to know what happened to my fave neighborhood pizza/beer/sports bar.  Elegy for Mr. G's O Mister G, how I loved your buttery, crispy crust! When I was too lazy to make dinner You phone number on speed dial was a must!  Basketball games with the regulars were great, and the crew was so friendly and quick that I nearly always stayed late.  O what happened to you, that you closed? Christmastime 2011 turned cold!  Where are you G crew? I really miss you!  Seriously, what happened to this place?

Finally got a chance to check out this place last Saturday! So glad that I did!  We went to see an indie doc and I was really impressed with the calendar. Upcoming films are actual small indie and foreign films that you would never see at Camelview.  The bar itself is a bit sparse on the decorations, but the style potential is there. Perhaps they are working on the ambiance? They had a great beer list, and although I didn't try any snacks it was nice to see them on the menu.  The theater was extremely comfortable and intimate, and the picture and sound quality were excellent. I enjoyed the film with my beer, although I'm not sure how the cocktail service would work if I had wanted another. Should I have waved the waitress over on one of the few times I saw her pop in the room? I suppose it will become more clear once us Phoenicians get the hang of this new-fangled theater-bar :)  I would highly recommend FilmBar for a date or just a group of friends craving an awesome movie-going experience with a great option to stay and chat over a drink after the film. I can't wait to go again!

Yay! More veg food in Tempe!  Highlights: - Delicious falafel - and more than one kind! - Condiment bar has great hot sauce, and tahini flowing freely - Love the Yam chips (despite an occasional burn victim among them)  Low-lights: - Very sparse decor, sort of like a cafeteria  I still need to try the hummus/salad bar, but I am addicted to the falafel sandwiches! I really hope this place stays afloat since when I'm there on weekends and nights it seems deserted. I wouldn't say it's the best falafel in the world - but it certainly has me hooked on price and selection!

This place is a little off the beaten path on Mill Ave in the old 3 roots location.   Wandered in a couple of weeks ago and was blown away by the selection and prices. Great vintage dresses, shirts, skirts and more for a steal! I wanted to buy at least 5 things straight away!  Hurry up and get here before they realize they can hike up their prices!

I have been to Angels Trumpet quite a few times since it opened. The servers do not know anything about beer and can never seem to make a logical suggestion to me. They always insist on calling the beers by their numbers instead of the names. The food that I have tried sucks and it is overpriced. I haven't eaten a lot of food there because the veg options blow.  I pride myself in patronizing local businesses and enriching the community of which I am a part, however the owner of this establishment doesn't care about his community. Thanks for tanking the Roosevelt BID, A-hole. You wanna know what's NOT free? My business!  I was already accidentally boycotting Angels Trumpet for quite some time because it sucks. Now I will continue to avoid this place and let my friends know that it's not a downtown-friendly bar. I'll be sharing this with everyone I know.

Several reviewers mentioned that the spinach & mushroom filling is vegetarian. If Aaron Pool makes it the same way that it's listed in the recipe he share with the Arizona Republic today, it is NOT VEGETARIAN (chicken stock).  I am shocked that several reviewers (who are vegetarians) seem to have had staff members steer them toward this option, despite the fact that it is NOT vegetarian.  Really? Why not just use vegetable stock? And if something seems veg, but is not, please tell your staff.  Here is the recipe that Mr. Pool shared: http://www.azcentral.com/story/life/food/recipes/2014/04/22/spinach-mushroom-enchilada-filling/8013227/

Delicious, authentic tortillas and flavorful salsa. Always willing to accommodate my vegetarian burrito whims! Excellent service is icing on the cake.

I really really wanted to like this place! Ever since it opened, I have occasionally tried the pizza. I've always stopped in for slices and was a little surprised at the cost, but I do like supporting local businesses, especially a late nite pizza place on Grand! Never been terribly impressed, but I've only ever had the cheese pizza.  This past Saturday (8/8), I finally decided to order a whole pie. I called in my order for an 18" with pineapples and jalapenos and headed down to the shop to pick it up. It wasn't quite ready when I got there, so I paid ($24+) and we waited a bit. They gave us an ample amount of cheese and peppers, which was nice. When I got home, I was soooo disappointed! (I don't know why since it was just the same as all the slices I've ever ordered.)  - Same old flavorless crust, poor spongy texture. - Blah sauce as always, tastes like just plain tomato with no spices. - Barely enough cheese to cover the pizza - about 12 pineapple pieces and maybe 14 jalapeno slices - for $3 each, I would expect to get more than 2-3 of each topping per slice!!  I don't like writing negative reviews of local businesses, but seriously, this place needs to listen to some feedback and pump up the FLAVOR and the VALUE of the pies!

Friendly service and absolutely delicious sammies! My husband and I look forward to our Friday morning date here all week. It's a really beautifully decorated space, as well, with local art hung and you can peek into Monorchid on your way to the ladies room. Great place to do a couple of hours of work- nice atmosphere and music selection is great and not too loud. Check it out if you haven't!
