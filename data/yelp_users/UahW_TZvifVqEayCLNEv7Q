By far, the most incredible HD dealership I've ever seen.

Great place to gather with family and friends!  Jumbo's offers an amazing breakfast.  Definitely an awesome hangout.

Highly Disappointed with the staff.  This location provided a great example of disconnected employees.  Want sucky service?  Come here.  Want inexpensive audio equipment?  Check the internet.  I'm surprised these dummies are still in business.

One has to wonder who Applebee's in Surprise has in mind for their target customer base, because it isn't anyone who desires a clean restaurant or attentive staff.    No doubt that the restaurant industry is highly competitive.  And those who are on the leading edge understand that it all comes down to customer service.  One can find a burger, steak, and other run-of-the-mill entrees just about anywhere... but the restaurant that provides a level of customer service second to none will build a following that propels them to the top of their competitors.  Unfortunately, Applebee's in Surprise seriously lacks this understanding.  My wife and I walked into Applebee's with our 2yo granddaughter Saturday night around 7pm... the place was less than 15% full.  We stood quite some time by the hostess area waiting for the hostess to come around; she didn't.  I walked around hoping to grab the attention of someone working there.  A few wait staff walked by without saying anything while others were huddled up together by the back of the bar laughing and joking.  Finally someone (she might have been the absentee hostess) asked if we had been helped and then sat us.  Where she parked us was a pigsty.  Yes, the table was clean, but the floors all around and underneath were about as filthy as it could get without the health department shutting them down.  We sat there for (no kidding) 5 minutes waiting for our server to come over.   One young lady working there asked asked if we had been helped, I told her no, so she huffed and turned around walking off quickly.  Another 3 to four minutes passed before our server came over introducing herself.  We had our menus when we sat down so we told our server we were ready to order.  A few minutes later a guy server brought our iced teas out, but the way he was holding them he had his hands and finger all over the rims of the glasses.  And he wasn't the cleanest looking dude, either.   There were approximately 24 empty tables all around us on our side of the restaurant and the hostess decided to sit the next group right beside us.  Not a big issue, but with a 2 yo standing in the booth one might think the hostess would've considered given the other group a little buffer space.  Nope.  The food came out was decent.  No complaints... it just wasn't anything to brag about.  At some point during our dinner a different server came by to sweep the area.  I commend her, but this task should be performed when there aren't customers at the table so not to by intrusive.  Apparently their floor sweeper was broke (possibly the handle), so the young lady was on here knees moving the sweeper back and forth trying to clean next to us.  Again, I commend her on her energy and effort.  Yet a different server walked over giggling and laughing very loudly like a very silly high school kid asking the other what she was doing.  The lady on the floor said, "I'm cleaning!  And the sweeper is broke."  The other girl laughed even more hysterically (very unprofessional) and walked off.  All-in-all, I hated my experience at Applebee's last night.  And this isn't the first time the experience has been immensely sub-par.  I don't know anything about the management at this location, but it seems they should consider a refocus of efforts towards customer service as a tangible asset in building their business... as the lack of it will lead to their downfall.

By far, the best kept secret in the North Central Corridor!  Wow!    My wife and I had such a great time having dinner here tonight. Once inside, the ambience makes you feel like you're part of a special club... a secret society, if you will.  I love everything about this place!  From the best Mexican food I've had in a very long time to the incredibly talented (and friendly) staff... There's so much to enjoy at Dick's Hideaway.  This is my new favorite place.

Great venue for the Phoenix area.  Plenty of parking and a staff geared towards guest satisfaction makes this racetrack a must see for locals.

WOW!!!  I visit a lot of the eateries around central PHX and St. Francis is, by far, the best of the best.  From the moment you walk in the staff greets you with a friendly smile and solid directions for the first timers.  The wait staff were genuine and attentive in their care of us even recommending dinner selections.  My daughter and the Forbidden Rice Bowl and I had the Chile Burger (medium rare).  Both meals were amazingly great tasting!  The ambience, the crowd, the food were all top notch.  This is my new favorite place to dine.

Food quality borders on average and below average.  It's gotten to be that I really don't like coming here anymore.

Smokers paradise!  It's a stink hole because of the "outside" bar.  It's a joke, really.  I think the smoke-free laws are being violated here.  My family and I won't be back.  Wish I could give this cruddy place NO STARS.

I haven't been here for several years and decided to visit Vogue Bistro once again with my wife.  On my previous visit I recall being disappointed... and seems not much has changed.  I know Vogue has positioned itself to be an upscale restaurant, but they fall short in so many ways.  I have eaten at numerous of Vogue's competitors in central Phoenix as well as other locations throughout the Valley and have thoroughly enjoyed them all, as one can verify with my previous Yelp reviews, however I cannot say the same with Vogue.  Lots of little things... but the issue was my meal; One of the blandest steaks I've ever had in my life.  I wonder if they've de-savorized their food due to their clientele being mostly seniors.  I don't know, but there are plenty of other eateries where one actually enjoys eating their meal.

Phenomenal!  Every aspect of Arrowhead Grill exudes excellence.  From the staff to the atmosphere to (especially!) the food... It is easy to witness the incredible high level of passion and commitment Arrowhead Grill holds to.  Bravo.  You've made me a Raving Fan.

Normally I'm a big fan of BJ's Restaurant, but tonight... Slow and somewhat inattentive staff.  After a 45 minute wait, we were seated, but it took another 10 minutes just to get our waters, which Michael (our waiter) spilled on the table.  We walked out after that.

I'm trying to like this place... But they make it very difficult.  I come here, with others, on a fairly regular basis.  On every occasion, the food is bland or borders on it, the service is slow, and something is typically wrong with my meal and/or drinks.  They carried the template for a bad experience once again tonight.  My recommendation is to try other places in Westgate as this place doesn't seem to care to improve.  #pitiful

Right around the corner from me and my wife's favorite go-to for lunch.  Great happy hour offerings.  Excellent food... but, by far, the best thing about Postino's is their staff.  Love every single one of them.

I dig the vibe as well as the ambiance and an extremely pleasant staff are always willing to assist.  The food was pretty decent... I had the Luci's famous burger with potato salad, my wife and daughter had pancakes.  They were both very pleased with their meal, I thought my meal was pretty good too.    Overall, a pretty dang good experience.  I'd definitely recommend Luci's.

Great service.  Great food!  Great times.    Outside is wonderful in the evening and especially on the weekend.  Inside is very enjoyable.  The game is always on on the numerous flat screen TVs hung about the place.  I truly enjoy it here.

Customer service was excellent tonight... The atmosphere and ambience works equally as exceptional. I had the pastrami sandwich which had a delicious flavor. All is well at the Windsor.

Stay away from Volvo of Phoenix at all cost.  This dealership is a nest of unethical scam artists.  They are either hyper-incompetent or disingenuous scam artists.  Either way, spend your hard earned money elsewhere.   They lied to me and my wife, then lied to cover up their lie, then made excuses to cover up their lies.  I called them out on it and they made even more excuses.    Volvo of Phoenix is the perfect example of why the public HATES car dealerships.    If you're a failure at everything in life... you can always go get a job at Volvo of Phoenix.  Nothing but unethical behavior here.

A lot of people working, but seemed no one was in charge.  Place only had 5 sets of customers, yet took forever to get our meals.  Staff used rags to wipe tables to hold our plates.  One employee kept wiping her nose with her finger over and over.  I wonder if she has a food handlers card.

Great pizza!  One of the best, in fact.    Customer service was pretty decent... But I think it might be hit or miss, at least as we experienced.  Two of our servers were phenomenal, one was just ok.  It all comes down to customer service, doesn't it.  I would definitely recommend Federal Pizza.

Great steak!  Poor service.     People go where they're invited... They come back where they're appreciated.    Not sure if I'll be back.

I've tried several sushi places around town and have found some pretty dang good places.  My go-to sushi restaurant is Squid Ink.  There's just something about them that has me going back over and over.  Great food and great staff.

Great customer service!!!  What separates squid ink from other sushi bars is the staff and their incredible customer service.  We all work hard for our money and squid ink understands that and, as a result, treats their hard working patrons with dignity, honor, and respect.  Plus... They've the best menu in town.  Say "hey" to Brian at the bar.
