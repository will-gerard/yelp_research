If I could give this location a zero star rating, I would.  I took what use to be my beautiful miniature 5lb maltipoo to be groomed at Petco. Worst experience EVER! Left her there at 11:30 in the morning and at 3:45 she was still wet!  Chris, the "so called-groomer" was trimming her... I questioned why he was doing it basically wet and he looked annoyed by me.... that's when I walked out into the store, as she was clearly not ready to be picked up, and could hear her screaming... I evened asked the retail clerk if this guy ever worked with small dogs.... 30 minutes later... she came out completely chopped up! Nothing about her cut was even and she was completely shaking. Bows would not stay on because her cut was so choppy and you could tell that she was never blown out! The guy must have seen my face as he said he wouldn't charge me. .. but he did say it was "her fault" because she moved a bit!! I am so ticked off as the only thing the manager said to me was that I was the only one who's ever complained about him! ...SERIOUSLY?!?! NEVER TAKE YOUR DOG TO GET GROOMED AT PETCO (unless you like the scruffy mutt look)... I am so regretting this choice. The worst part about the whole thing... nobody there ever offered an apology... just a whole bunch of excuses. =(

Love, love, love this place! I've been going to Jabz about a year and I have NEVER been in better shape! Having always been that girl who spends endless hours at the gym (with minimum results).. a few of us gym ladies bought a group-on (15 sessions) to try it out.. I was hooked! I now spend less time at the gym (45min workouts) and have had amazing results... 25lbs down with more lean muscle than I thought possible! Whenever someone I haven't seen in a while makes a comment on how great I look..  I always tell them to give Jabz a try... they wont regret it! Whether you are already in amazing shape or its your first time working out in years.... Len, Kim, Katie and Lauren will take great care of you and ensure you have the best possible workout! ... What do you have to lose??? ... except the weight and inches!!!!

I've been coming to Smart Gym since the beginning and have seen them go through a few transitions.. all positive and that's what keeps me coming in daily! The variety of classes they offer ( all with great instructors) have really kept my shape. I have always encountered nothing but friendly staff... perfect example: My husband and two teenage sons joined a few months after I did and we're actually never on the same account as I thought they were... I had two different debit cards for my account and theirs... one of which had been switched out (identity theft).... well I was under the impression that everything is debiting fine... but I got a call from the manager (Jonnie) today letting me know that it's been 3months since I've paid... and he wanted to know if there were any issues and what he could do to  work with me on this so it didn't go to collections... I told him I could meet up in a few hours and could we go over everything to see what the issues were.... when I walked in (late) he was right there waiting. Again... he patiently went through my family's whole account and fixed! ... We are all now on the same schedule, debited now from just the checking account itself. I'm glad Jonnie took the time to call me.... otherwise who knows!?! I obviously was not paying attention but good thing Jonnie was! I recommend that people stop having debits from their card and just use the account itself.... saves alot of headaches when the banks send out completely new cards for whatever the reason... Oh! One more thing... I also highly recommend Terri's Tuesday morning 8:30 class (smart strength intervals) as she's got great energy!  Lisa's Thursday 8:30 class (strictly strength) she will really work with you on your form..and I'm always sore after! ..Lastly, really any of Gaby's classes! (my fav is her Wednesday 10:45 barre method).. Gaby will always make you sweat and sore with some of her crazy moves... But NEVER sorry you took her class!
