I was in Phoenix for a weekend getaway and thought I hid a foodie dead end after a few meals. I was not wow'd by much even at places that had good reviews, and disappointed I couldn't find a decent meal. And then I came to Postino! It was bustling on a Sunday morning with nearly all the tables in the restaurant filled. Luckily we were able to snag a table out on the patio. The air was filled with live music and the atmosphere was relaxed and exciting at the same time.   Everyone on Yelp mentioned the bruschetta. Definitely get the bruschetta!!! You can choose 4 different types for $13.50. The bread was perfectly soft and all the toppings were excellent. If I had my way, I could eat this all the time. The two of us also shared an Vegetarian panini which was very good but too filling to finish alongside the bruschette. Mimosas are only $5 too.   Postino's is worth it!

I'm typically skeptical of restaurants in hotels. But for some reason "Prime Steakhouse" was unusually alluring.   We had a late reservation and we got seated fairly quickly. Our server Abram was really helpful and friendly. I got the Petit Fillet Mignon and it was so good! Pure meat cooked perfectly. A side of mashed potatoes and asparagus to share- this was a good meal. All the staff was really friendly to us; great service at Fleming's.   Their wine list is on an iPad, which is pretty fun to play with too!

After coming to Phoenix, I realized that good reviews don't necessarily mean good food. I expected a crowded room when coming to FEZ on a Saturday morning for brunch but it was pretty scarce both inside and on the patio. I was SO disappointed with my eggs benedict. Eggs benny is one of my favorite weekend treats of all time and when done wrong, I am a very sad girl. The eggs weren't poached right and ended up in a little puddle next to the tough-to-chew baguette. The slices of ham looked like lunch meat and overall the dish was pretty awful. Two stars goes for their grapefruit cocktail which was tasty. I wish I could have traded my benedict for more drinks.   Sorry FEZ, just didn't cut it for me.

This was one awkward experience I wish I could forget. Everything about Axis-Radius is awkward. The space is awkward, the people are awkward, the dancing is awkward, even the DJ was awkwardly mixing the music.   Nothing about A-R could get me in the mood to get my dance on, not even a few drinks. I tried in the room with house music until unusually strong fog machines came blasting down on my body from above. Was I being abducted by aliens?! Why can't I see anything around me?? What's going on? That was my cue to leave. I was excited to check out the Scottsdale nightlife but I must have come to the wrong place.

It's a Friday, at midnight. The Vig Uptown has 4 stars on Yelp.....HOW COME THERE'S NO ONE HERE??? Where is everyone? Why is it so quiet? I was very confused- it looks like a place where there should be a ton of people. But no, empty. Sad.
