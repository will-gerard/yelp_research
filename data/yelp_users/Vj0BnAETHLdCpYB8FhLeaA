Genova pizza is amazing.  Pesto that will light up your palate. Potato that smoothes each bite.  Italian brick oven pizza crust. Simply amazing. Go enjoy.

This is some of the freshest, best tasting food - and you will crave it.   The staff - ask for Abner- is friendly and attentive. My favorite is the "soup on the side" but too frequently I have company and it's not a great sharing dish. The curry is great - and go spicy - it's a tollerable heat.  One more advantage - good wine list, all bottles just $20. Enjoy one of my favorite spots.

Best tasting bagels in Arizona and of anywhere that I have tried in the world.  The owner makes you feel like family.  My son loves to go too.   My staple - bagel breakfast sandwich with lox.

Walked out.  Host staff disorganized. Plenty of seating and they say, "it'll be a 15 minute wait." Then take number to text when the table is ready.  They've called non-stop since. We went to Arcadia Tavern -- far better and friendly!!
