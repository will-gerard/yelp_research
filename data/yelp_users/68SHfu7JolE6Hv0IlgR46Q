House of Tricks is one of my favourite restaurants. I've only stopped here for lunch, so I have no idea what dinner's like, but I'm sure it's just as good an experience.   This place always offers fresh options daily, and I never find myself looking at the same menu whenever I come here, which is great! I'm impressed every time I order. I've taken friends and family to this restaurant, and they feel the same about the food here, so that's a plus. The food here is a fusion of many different cultures, and every time, the chefs make it work. I once had a chicken burger with oaxaca cheese and miscellaneous toppings with fried okra, and I've never been able to find a chicken burger that was treated the same way. I also ordered a grilled salmon with a spring salad on top, and despite it being farm-raised salmon, it was still flavourful and complimented the salad very well.   All their food is presented gorgeously, and the service is also some of the best I've experienced.

Best Japanese restaurant in Phoenix. Tip: don't get their sushi rolls there, that's kid's stuff. Order from within the menu, or from the tapas menu ($5 items). I recommend the agedashi tofu and kurobuta sausage skewers!  Food comes in somewhat small portions so I wouldn't recommend coming here with more than 4 people if you plan on stuffing yourself.  I visited here last weekend for my birthday and got the saikyo beef tongue, garlic manila clams, kurobuta sausage, grilled bronzino (Mediterranean sea bass), grilled squid, and a few other things I honestly can't quite remember. Food came out really quick--maybe in under 10 minutes? They also spaced out the time between platters of food to ensure that we'd all enjoy each plate one by one.   I appreciate their take on Japanese cuisine, as most places only offer bentos and maki rolls, which gets boring after a while.

This place has quickly become one of my favourite lunch stops when I'm at school, partially due to the distance, but also because it's tasty! For the portions you get when you order, it's a great price.   I like to order the lunch special whenever I go there, but it's only from 11-2pm (?). What you get is barbequed chicken, grilled strips of steak, and meat jun, which is thiny sliced beef battered in egg over rice, and four different sides! The way they barbeque the chicken is tender, and the grill flavour is apparent whenever you take a bite. The same goes for the steak. I'm not sure I really care for the meat jun, because mostly what I taste is egg. The sides are wonderful, I usually order their macaroni salad, marinated cucumber, seaweed salad, and the noodles. I used to order their kimchi, but it's not tart enough for me, so I stopped.   This is a great joint to quickly stop by and grab a lunch, so I don't have any problems regarding the look of the restaurant since I'm there for only around 10 minutes at a time. The staff is nice, quick, and has great service.

I went here on a whim because my friend and I weren't looking for an upscale dining place for dinner. It was a huge mistake.  I ordered vegetable tempura and ramen, and I've never been so underwhelmed. The tempura sauce wasn't even the right sauce, and I think you'd have to really be trying hard to get it wrong.  I didn't expect much from the ramen, especially it being only $9. Unfortunately for me, I had more to complain about after I received it. The ratio of noodles to broth was 1:3 and worst of all, the noodles were packaged. Meaning they were thrown in absentmindedly before dishing it out of the kitchen and onto the dinner table. The noodles still being stuck together, matched with the alarmingly salty broth was not ramen.   We also ordered food for takeout, and they had the nerve to leave the udon noodles in hot broth to get soggy. We also ordered an appetizer of edamame that never came, but they still charged us for it. Never going back.
