We used to love this place and get take-out from there 2+ times a month but something happened over the last 12 months and their philosophy on customer service became non-existant.   My girlfriend is vegan and we ordered (take out) pad thai without meat/egg. It had chicken, no biggie... We called them up and they told her that it did not have chicken in it and that we would have to take it back to prove they had prepared it wrong. When she brought it back, they hadn't even started cooking the food because they believed that she was lying. We swore we wouldn't go back...   Today we thought we'd give it another go. I ordered chicken pad thai and wanted to replace the shrimp with veggies. After putting the phone down for minutes, I could hear her talking to the manager. They wanted me to get veggie pad thai and add chicken (Another $2). She told me that this is because they pre-prepare their food.   We've decided to just get thai from Sa-Bai and they will get our 2+ times a month thai fix.

Excellent sandwiches, nice young adults working there. Stopped in to kill some time and chow a sub. Kills subway! Super awesome in every way.  If I didn't live 40 miles away I'd be here often.  Give it a shot!

This place is an absolute gem of a restaurant. If you havn't been here, you're missing out. I went for the first time tonight with some friends and had an absolute amazing experience. We met George the owner and when people talk about "the charm of going to a family restaurant" this is what they are talking about. Incredible food and heres a tip... if he asked if you saved room for desert... don't say no. Make this desert your cheat meal... you wont regret it.

I recently had a miss-understanding and an unfortunate experience at this location. I went home and sent a note on the subway website. This location has an incredibly high rating and I understand why. I got a call from the franchise owner within 7 hours. It's apparent that this restaurant is committed to excellence and serves its community with dignity and honor. Thank you for the call, for what it's worth, it ment a lot and I felt compelled to share with the community.

Killer burger but I want to k1ll the owner! I tell the owner (joking) " It's my 1st time here, what's the one burger?"  He pushes the menu at me and says "the menu" then looks past me and yells " anyone here know what they want!?!? " The burger Nazi owns two hippies burger... He was cool after that but wow! Everything else about the experience was pure gold though!   Still left a salty taste tho... ONE STAR FOR YOU! - the review nazi

I've been wanting to try this place out. I got my phone replaced today from the apple store and on my way out I thought I'd get a burger to go.   The place was incredibly packed. Dude at the bar was cool, girls at the front were really nice. It took a long time to get the burger but It's not McDonnalds and I had zero expectations of being in and out.   I just finished my burger and it was so good, I had to jump on yelp and write a good review for the place.   I'll call ahead next time i want one to go but the place was so cool, I'll probably want to just eat there. Check it out if you havn't already.

So I don't leave reviews on Yelp that often... It takes something really really good or really really bad to get me to write reviews on here.   We've ordered from this place 3 times now and all 3 times we've had an excellent experience. I'm really surprised to see the negative reviews because the food is _REALLY_ good! The pizza reminds us of Z-PIzza which we love. It's not greasy, it's everything we love about Z-Pizza but way cheaper. They have vegetarian options which is huge for us because my girl is vegetarian. She said the falafel was really good. Today I ordered a grilled Italian sandwich and it was one of the most delicious things I've eaten in a while.   You should absolutely give this place a shot if you havn't already and if you had a bad experience, I'd say give them another try.
