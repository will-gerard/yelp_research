I'm not one to complain on here. in fact, most of my posts are positive. If your hungry, Don't get delivery from here took my pizza an hour and a half  to get here when I was quoted 30 minutes on a Tuesday night! Not to mention I live less than a mile away. My pizza was cold and there are a lot of other late night delivery places I could have gone to. Super disappointed, tired, and hungry. I will be ordering Oliveo's from now on unless someone contacts me and tries to make this right because the service I received was unacceptable.

Dont go here if you want service. The servers are impossible to get service from. & when I did finally order I waited an hour and a half for nachos just to hear that "They gave my order away to another table".Wait another 30 mins.... finally get my order. & then when the bill comes not even comped or discounted.
