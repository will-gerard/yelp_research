Awful. I had spilled something on a blazer and asked that they stain treat it. After looking over the jacket upon pick up their "stain remover" had left bleach marks all over the blazer and did NOT get rid of the stain. Would not recommend to anyone!

I love going to Ari Sushi! They have great service, everyone is very friendly and the food is fantastic!  Ari is more of a local neighborhood sushi bar which is part of why it is so great! Try it out sometime!  I highly suggest the hot night roll, the kiss my ass roll and monkey brains...yum!

Absolutely love this place. However I just saw that they are shutting down this location and moving to the Miller shopping center in August.  I believe the Miller shopping center is on miller and Indian school
