Ummmm red velvet ice cream?  YES!!!!!  Great ice cream on a chilly phoenix afternoon.  A little pricey, $5 schmoes for a kids cup.  Total for 2 adults and a toddler about $18.00 bucks.  The chicks working the counter were super cool tho and I thought the overall vibe was nicer than ColdSlabCreamatorium.  Thumbs up cats and birds...

I was underwhelmed.  I liked the charcoal grilled taste to the dog but I've had a much better dog than Ted's.  Nathan's for instance is a superior hotdog.  I really wanted to like this place but everything was just okay, not good, not great.

Like most others I was drawn to this place by good ole Guy Fieri.  They even have a large sign in their window that proudly states "SEE US ON THE FOOD NETWORK."    Well Guy, you have failed me again.  My dad actually drove down from Tucson after seeing the same episode of DDD and we made a grand Father's Day event out of it.  I have 2 words for you now, PAINFULLY AVERAGE.  I would have rather gone to Old El Paso BBQ.  First of all they make you wait forever.  Our waitress set waitresses back 100's of years.  She was terrible.  She brought one plate out at a time.  She forgot appetizers.  I could go on but lets get to the food that has apparently won so many trophies.  First things first.  It was cold, all of the meat was cold.  The brisket tasted and looked like dog food.  It just wasnt very good.  mashed potatoes were funky as hell and not in a good way.  Everything is drenched in sauce, everything.  Can good BBQ stand alone?  Yes.  Thee Pitts Again needs lotsa sauce.  Not one of us finished a plate.  So what the hell is Guy Fieri's problem.  Could he really believe this to be great food?  What about all the people stating its the best BBQ ever?  Its a mystery to me.  But Thee Pitts Again really is the Pitts.

I tend to stay away from chains.  I don't know what had gotten into me.  I wanted a steak.  I wanted large portions.  I wanted $10 spinach artichoke dip.  I wanted good service.  I wanted GREAT FOOD!    Fortunately I almost got it all.  Fortunately.  For some reason the proverbial glass was half full last night.  If not for our waitress being a complete angel I could have easily lost it.  The meal was pretty much perfect.  The main complaint was the inability of the kitchen to put out a medium cooked tri tip.  The first one they put out was served rare and well done.  Our poor waitress had obviously had to put with these sort of things alot and was visibly shaken.  I cannot stress enough how awesome our waitress was and quickly reminded her that we appreciated her efforts.  The second tri tip that came out was rare, Med rare and medium.  At this point I said fack it and just enjoyed the rest of my meal.  We then got visit from the manager, a charming gentleman with a shaved head.  We were shocked when he revealed to us he was well versed in the lost art of customer service.  What a Guy.  He understood that his kitchen was stinking up the joint and that we wouldn't be paying a dime for the kitchens mistakes.    Normally I would not make a statement as bold as this but...  Our waitress Jodie and the shaved head gentleman running the joint are directly responsible for earning Claim Jumper a few new customers for life.  What a breath of fresh air to be treated like a paying customer.  ;)  Thanks Jodie and shaved head dude.  You're both bright lights in an otherwise dark night.  Stay gold......

Ahh Captain Bill's Sub Factory.  If you rep the metrocenter area as I have since my birth in 73 then you no doubt have eaten at Captain Bill's.  I've been eating subs there for nearly 25 years.  This place is a true phoenix landmark.  Simply put, I love this place.  I love everything about it.  Where else can you roll in with 3 bucks and roll out full?  I used to ride my skateboard up there in the mid eighties and take the trash out for the many hot chicks both from cortez and moon valley that worked there at the time and they would feed me free subs.  Then I would play 720 until they kicked me out.  Nothing beats a Captain Bills Italian sub.  Nothing.  I continued to go there over the years, I got married, I had kids and I took them there.  As I sat there this afternoon with my 16 year old son feeling sentimental as the faces of those I knew so long ago stared back up at me from the tables.  I vowed to never eat a sub anywhere ever again but at good ole Captain Bill's.  As we left my son commented that the chicks were hot.  "They always were" I said, "they always were."  Thanks Bill.

OK taking the fam out for ice cream on a saturday afternoon to a real live ice cream parlor seems like a great idea in theory but...  Lets take a few steps back.  This Swensen's has been at this location ever since I can remember, 28th drive and Peoria and oh how I love my ghetto MetroCenter Area, MCA fo life y'all.  But just like the area is going to hell so are some of the businesses.  Our waiter was a young lad, likeable enough but had way too many things to do to really give great service.  He was waiting and bissing tables when then saw him behind the counter slangin sundaes.  Now my shit was good, some kind of candy bar sundae.  But I asked for chocolate ice cream instead of the vanilla and got, you guessed it vanilla.  We had waited so long for it that I finally just said fug it.  I'm eating vanilla.  They also gipped me on the sweet swensens wafer cookie and that is some low down shit.  My wife had a wuss bag simple sundae(she cant hang with the big boys).  My 16 year old had a super chocolate sundae and my 2 year old, well she had a scrary clown deal.  We all like the ice cream.  The vibe and service just wasnt to par.  Grand total for an afternoon of ice cream with the fam w/tip - $29.00 buckaroos frenz.  Now that is some insane dinero for metrocenter grindage....

These mother facking dipshits at pong pong.  The sad thing is I actually enjoyed eating at pong pong.  Tonight I didnt want to go out, I ordered delivery and that was my fack up.  I ordered 30 dollars worth of food and was waiting in anticipation until the 45 minutes I was told for delivery slowly passed.  50 minutes.  55 minutes.  60 minutes.  I call into pong pong and ask if my food has left yet.  I told them its been over an hour and if it hasnt left my wife will pick it up.  The girl on the phone actually has the nerve to give me attitude.  She tells well too bad the delivery driver has left.  At this point I'm thinking good because I am hungry.  75 minutes in I call back and just cancel my order.  Meanwhile they have already charged my credit card.  This is the kind of bullshit that just doesnt need to happen.  Do you think anyone gives a fack about customer service anymore?  Fack no, we should be so lucky to eat their food.  The girls on the phone then mocks me and says, "sorry we only have one delivery driver."  I was like TF, then dont tell me 45 minutes.  I live 2 minutes away!!!!!!!!!!!  If I could go back I would just have picked it up and spared myself some more subpar experiences.    You know there is a little Vietnamese joint down the road called Nam Sao.  You wont find better customer service, they'll treat you like family and they are proud of their food.  The sad thing is in this economy they are struggling.  Thats sad to see when places like pong pong are willing to throw customer's (that actually like their food) away like trash.  I guess in this economy pong pong can afford to lose customers.  I hope the management at pong pong sees this and I hope it sinks in that they just lost a family of four as customers that fully enjoyed their food in the past.  Shame on you pong pong.  I wonder how many people would kill for a position taking orders for a chinese joint these days.  Yet pong pong employs people that clearly have no idea what it means to service a customer.  yes I am pissed.  same on you pong pong.   ps the delivery driver actually shows up like 90 minutes in and hasnt been informed of my cancellation.

Pizza By Napoli how I love thee.  This is how I would picture a little mom and pop shop in the big city back east.  Everyone speaking in thick italian accents and the type of people you would love to have as friends.  I always order the large meatball pie and my friends, it fuggin rules.  Thin slices of what you know are a great italian grandmas recipe passed on for generations.  Great mild sauce and thin and crispy crust.  This is in my top 5 pizza joints in AZ falling only to Nellos.  The dine in experience is a must, old school booths, old school arcade games, sports on the TV.  It reminds me of a time before the 30 minutes or its free delivery craze.  When people would sit down and enjoy a pie right out of the oven.  Even the high chairs are old school and full of metal.  If you call in take out, remember your assigned number given on the phone.  They'll love you for it.  In closing, Napoli kicks arse frenz....................

OK so i've been here 9 or 10 times now over the span of the last year.  Each time on a Friday night or Saturday afternoon.  I would always order the italian sub with extra bug juice.  The owners, have always had this thing when you walk in that they act put off to have customers.  Like they are doing you a favor by being open.  Well I liked the fresh baked bread for the sub and just kind of chalked the owners shitty attitudes up to a Soup Nazi-esque situation.  Well last night (Friday) my daughter wanted Villa Deli so we headed on out.  When we walked in we were ignored for a good few minutes.  Nothing unusual for this place until we were finally greeted with a "We're all out of bread" statement from black curly haired lady who acts like she is in hell.  She the says, "I don't know what else you'd want to order.". I say, "Well I come for the fresh baked bread.". As we turn to walk out this lady actually has a very audible sigh of relief.  That's it, I'm facking out people.  I'm pretty sure I can find another deli that bakes bread on site.  I'm done.  Customer service in this day and age is truly a lost art.  Unfortunately the people running Villa Deli lost it a long time ago.

ALLLLLLLLLLLLL HYPE!!!!!!!  Decent mexican, decent chinese, decent.  Thats it.  The ordering process is facking ridiculous.  All those people fawking over the jade red chicken are out of their minds.  The jade red chicken tastes like ketchup and hot sauce.  Thats the sauce.  Avoid the hype.  It is not cool to eat here no matter how bad you want it to be.  save your money, any Bertos or half bit chinese will do.  make your own fusion.

Uggg.  All Lee's are not created equal.  I guess I'm a little bit of a Lee's snob after having worked in San Jose for 3 weeks and eating it almost every day.  I got the grilled pork and I think it was just cut up cheap ham.  I was horrified at this abomination of a Lee's after having talked so much shit to my wife about how good it was.  It was painfully all right.  No green waffles, no chuoi nep nuong, no assorted treats layed out just so.  Not a young coconut in site.  They did have the fresh squeezed sugarcane juice I have come to love.  But it still has nothing on Nuoc Mia Ninh Kieu's sugarcane and kumquat explosion.    I sadly went away with a large baguette and the hopelessness of knowing Arizona is missing out big on the REAL Lee's Sandwiches experience and that is a mofo shame...

Ok so Its time to light Pho Avina's facking ass on fire.  I remember going here when just the old lady ran the joint.  She was top notch, the food was good, she cranked out one hell of an avocado boba.  Those were the days party people, those were the days.  Now let me compound things a bit.  I am talking tons of shit to my co workers about how I love vietnamese food and that you just cant get a good nuoc mia ninh kieu in Phoenix (obviously trying to be a food badass, cuz I am) and Pho Avina goes and sucker kicks my shit in the ballz.  For the record I ordered easy.  I went ZERO pho as it was 142 outside.  I went BBQ Pork bahn mi, spring rolls, bobas.  I GOT SOME MOTHERFACKINGSHITTASTICAMERICANIZEDBOOLSHEEET.  I say again, BOOOOOOOLSHEEEEEEET.  Bahn Mi  Rotten brown HALLOPEENOHS, check. Funky ass pork, chiggitty check y'all. MotherFACKINGCHUNKS of veggies, microphone check y'all.    How do you fuck up a bahn mi?  Spring Rolls  rotten lettuce, uhhh huhhhh crispy rice wrapper, you bet your ass  Boba  Got FACKING syrup?  Let me tell you this vietnamese food experience went over like a turd in a punch bowl with my co workers.  Who now have undisputed proof that I am a dip shit and to not listen to me.  Based on this one Pho Avina experience.  My co workers have shunned me.  Pho Avina just got put on notice.  I used to eat there because I thought it was a cool little AUTHENTIC vietnamese joint.  I dont go in for mass consumption shit.

OUTMOTHERFACKINGSTANDING!!!!!!!!! Loved this experience!!!!!  Started off with the fried wontons with salsa and guac.  Was incredible, I say again, INCREDIBLE!  I asked our waitress if the salsa was made in house, IT WAS MOTHER TRUCKERS and the guac too.  The salsa tasted extremely fresh and the guac was chunky and tasty as eff.  I wanted to hug the guy who made it.  But sadly he wasnt there.  On to the burgers.  The girfriend unit and myself both got bacon cheeseburgers.  The burgers were perfectly cooked to medium and medium well.  The seasoning made the burg.  Facking amazing and crispy ass tots to boot.  Any time i find myself in downtown Phoenix i will be thinking of eating here.  LOVED IT!!!!!!!

EDIT  Ok  walked in and ordered take-out.  I expected a 10/15 minute wait.  There was no one in front of me.  No during the course of' my (what would be a) 25 minute wait.  I watched several more people come in after me and be seated at different tables.  10 mins go by - everyone dining in is enjoying their refreshing canned thai teas and enjoying the apps.  15 mins go by - people are starting to get their lunchs.  I think, "Cant be long now."  Holy eff was I wrong.  The waitress comes out of the kitchen, sets food down on the table next to me and walks off.  20 mins goes by -  some random vietnamese dude walks straight in and sits at the table next to me with the food that the waitress had put down 5 minutes ago.  I know this because there was a clock right in front of my face.  The waitress then comes out and the random vietnamese dude starts bitching about his food and she takes it back into the kitchen.  At this point the chef coming rolling out and sits down in front of him with his food and starts eating it!  Turns out they're very friendly with eachother and the enitre wait staff has a good laugh.  25 mins in kids.  I have a mini meltdown when the waitress comes out of the kitchen to serve someone their pho who has just walked in like 10 mins ago.  finally got up and asked for my money back.    At the point the waiter opened the kitchen door and said its ready.  If its fucking ready give it to me.  I was about to freak out but there were some young buff vietnamese guys there and I didnt know if I started trouble if I would just have to fight the waitstaff and kitchen help at Pholicious or if the vietnamese clientele would join in and fight me as a gang.  The dude refused my money back and handed me the bag of food that had probably been just sitting there the whole time.  What a bunch of fucktards these people at Pholicious are.  With the kitchen storage area in the dining room and your 2 gallons of shampoo from walmart.  I get the food home and I have a hungry wife and daughter.  The crab and asparagus soup sounded great and had gotten great reviews.  What the fuck yelpers?  This was nothing more than canned egg drop soup with white asparagus chunks and diced fake crab meat.  diced, fucking diced.  Thats some old school false advertising there.  Fake crab sucks balls.  I also had the sliced pork and vermicelli with chopped egg rolls.  The egg rolls had decent taste but didnt taste fresh.  Evertyhting else was dry dry bland fuckitty band.  Thanks for the overall shitty experience Pholicious.

God dammit JR's Fish and Chips.  God dammit.  I was so excited when I saw the old Jack in the Crack at 35th and Peoria being converted into the Fish and Chips Joint.    For the record I am a huge Pete's fan.  I dropped in Friday night.  I ordered shrimp and fries and hush puppies.  Their system of walk up order then get in a second line was confusing people.  Add into that mix the woman actually running the register and handling the cash was probably tweaking her balls off.  Or she was an ex tweaker that forgot how to act normal or she was just nuts.  She was openly talking shit to the guy ordering in front of me when he had something to say about her register skills.  Any way surreal experience to say the least.  Down to the food.  Oh I ate that greasy ass shit.  I ate the fuck out of it.  But it was all pre-packaged frozen shrimp and fries and the same for the hush puppies, over cooked balls of hard crust.  So shame on you JR's.  The place had some people in it too.  I wont be back unless the start advertising fresh seafood.

Lemme tell y'all something right now.  Check my profile.  Yelp Elite 10, Yelp Elite 11.  What this means to you is, I aint no bitch.  I eat good food mother fackers.  GOOD FOOD.  Rocket Burger did not disappoint.  I've got 2 words for you.  Rocket sauce.  I'm not going to act like I know whats in, I do not.  I do know that Rocket sauce rocks the body that rocks the party.  I dont even care whats in it.  I only know that it is good and thats all I need.  I was extremely disappointed to find they had no Dublin DeePee.  Which is a staple in any specialty soda shop.  Too many rules and restrictions it seems.    Its pretty easy to make an average burger but something completely different to make a great one.  ROCKET BURGER MAKES A GREAT BURGER.  I put my 2, count them 2, Yelp Elite Badges on the line here and declare that the In and Outs and 5 Guys of the world better watch their back.  Its obvious the guys running rocket burger are developing a rabid following by just being cool dudes serving high level food.  NONE CAN DEFEND!   ps This review is pretty much a 5 star.  I've just started being more stingy with my Stars.

Its official, I'm leaving my wife.  I am leaving this exquisite and undeniably beautiful half eastern indian, half white chick for the Brulee Burger and Paradise Valley Burger Co.  It has to be done, I am in love.  Everything on this burger works together like 100 bikini clad women chasing Benny Hill.  The beef, the bacon, the fried egg with the drippy yolk, the havarti, the burnt sugar encrusted bun, I FACKING LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!  Not to mention, cool dudes run this place, cool dudes I say.    I am going to make my Dad drive down from Tucson just to go to this place.  He is getting old now and shouldnt be making that drive by himself.  But he loves burgers and PV Burger company is worth the risk.  Thanks AZ yelpers, you did me right homies!

5 stars for the vibes. 5 stars for the rad chicks running the joint. 20 stars for the Coyote Oatie ice cream sundae!  Stopped in on our way out from the Glendale Chocolate Affair and found heaven in a bowl.  I got the famed Coyote Oatie ice cream sundae and it was facking awesome.  Its basically the best ice cream sundae you've ever had with one of their signature Coyote Oatie cookies all warmed up and on top.  This is the perfect dessert.  When the cookie crumbles into the ice cream and caramel it is awesome.  Loved this little joint in downtown Glendale, loved the ladies running it.  I'd much rather give my money to a local joint like this rather than a CORPORATE Coldstone or Baskin Robbins.    Already planning another trip.  MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!!!!!

HOLY PHO-CKEN SHIZZ PARTY PEOPLE!  I love this place!  Not only was the food OUTSTANDING but the people running the joint were awesome.  My daughter loves Pho Ga so I took her and my wife here last night for dinner.  We had originally planned on going to Nam Sao (our go to joint) but found it closed for remodeling.  Fate had intervened.  Just to get the pho out of the way, my daughter and wife both loved their Pho Ga.  I on the other hand absolutely LOVED the Com Dac Biet combo plate.  Every bite was amazing.  The grilled pork and chicken had that familiar Vietnamese smokey grilled taste.  The shrimp was cooked perfectly.  The broken rice perfect and the side of clear soup I got was out of this world.  My favorite thing on the plate, the shrimp paste and the meatloaf.  This is the perfect meal.  You cant go wrong here.  I will be back, again and again...
