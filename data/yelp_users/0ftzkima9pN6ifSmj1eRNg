I had an out of town guest with me, I thought shopping in Kierland and having dinner at True Foods would be a delightful evening.  Well shopping was wonderful.....however, our experience at True Food doesn't even deserve a one star!!!  Upon arrival, gave my name and we were told 10 to 15 minute wait, it was more like 35 minutes.  We wanted to have a drink and we had to order from the bar and then go sit at a table waiting to be call for our dinner table.  It should be we can sit down at the waiting table and have a server take our drink order and have the ability to add to our food bill.  Finally, we got to the table, wasn't clean, service was slow, understanding it was busy.  Food finally arrived cold... asked the server to get a manager, and telling the manager the food was cold, he looked at us like we had 3 heads.  Finally, our server, Adele, came over and he said before the manager spoke, that he would take care of it. Why do you need a manager if the server can handle it better.  Terrible management.  Hostess was terribly disorganized.  Will not dine there again!!!

I have been going to Tammy and her salon for over 10 years.  She is the best at her craft and does a great job.  Tammy is always friendly and happy to see me, and is willing to please her clients.  Tammy's salon is easy to find, a pleasant atmosphere, easy to relax and enjoy your treatment, and rates are comparable to other salons.  Once you go there, you will see why I think she is the best!  Try it, you won't be sorry!

Absolutely perfect setting for my daughter's bridal shower, the private room was perfectly set up, black chairs only as requested, everything done to my satisfaction and more!  Lisa Nelson was a delight to work with, she did everything possible to make it just perfect for me.  Always making sure I was in the know and that I got my money's worth.  Nate, the manager, was always making sure I was happy and things were going as planned.  The servers were a delight, always making sure drinks were filled, plates were removed, etc.  The presentation of the food buffet was gorgeous, dishes were marked as what it was, food and desserts were brought out on time, it was perfect.  No one rushed us out of the room, was sat and talked as people started to leave, and we didn't feel rushed at all.    I would return to eat there, for their delicious food, great service, and lovely setting....  you made the bridal shower a perfect success.... Thank you!!
