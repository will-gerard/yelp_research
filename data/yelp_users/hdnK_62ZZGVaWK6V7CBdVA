This dealership was awesome great family owned and operated.  Great customer service gave the price range I wanted to spend and what type of car I want and was surprised at how many selection o had.  Special shot out to Ron and the young lady works there (sorry forgot her name)but they we wonder I walked out with a 2004 dodge durango with less than 80k miles  and it runs like a champ.  I truly would recommend them to all my friends and family.
