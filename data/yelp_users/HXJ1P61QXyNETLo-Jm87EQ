Do you want to start off by saying that this restaurant is amazing point blank period. The Chicken Biryani is the best. And the Chicken Curry is also my wife's favorite, just make sure you tell them how spicy you want it.

From the moment I walked in, until the moment I left, I felt welcome. I was greeted by smiling faces and it continued until we were on our way out the door. The Manager, Dan, was so pleased we decided to come in (it was our first time) and he even gave us a complimentary appetizer! Our food was cooked to perfection, the server kept our drinks full....the atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable. The only thing they could improve on is the way they walk through the restaurant. They were walking in between all the tables, instead of using the walkway they have already. Other than that, I love this place! Friendly staff, relaxed environment, great food....what else can you ask for?

I recommend this hotel, it is amazing. The rooms are clean, The members of the staff are friendly and very helpful. The location of the hotel is in a bad neighborhood, So just don't go wandering after dark. The breakfast buffet is one of the best that I've ever had, they have lots of choices and their chefs are very friendly.   One thing I did not like about my stay there, was that I called the front desk to have transportation set up to the airport and they provided me with a driving service called " First Class Sedan ". This service is completely unprofessional due to the fact that they told the front desk that the ride would be $25 flat, But once they came and picked me up I got to the airport and the driver said it was $30 plus gratuity. He also looked and acted very intoxicated if not he was on drugs. The manager should definitely reevaluate their driving service.

I just ordered from here on grub-hub, despite all of the reviews posted. I am a firm believer of seeing things for my own eyes, in this case tasting it for myself. I ordered the Chicken Crisp which was horrible, It was soggy and absolutely inedible by the time it was delivered. I also ordered the plain cheese crisp. It was a pinch of cheese in between two 4' corn tortillas. I'm not going to even write about everything else I ordered, as you can tell where this is going. But I had to give them a 1 star because the best part out of this experience was the delivery driver, not only was he punctual he was also very polite and friendly. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone based on my experience but feel free to try it for yourself.

I want to start off by saying the Radisson Phoenix airport is one of the best hotels in the valley hands-down. From the time you walk in you will meet a wonderful lady named Joy who is one the front desk associates that works there, to the time you leave you should be satisfied. I am a frequent visitor to this hotel I stay there about 2 to 3 times a month. The beds are absolutely phenomenal, you can also ask for comfort control pillows so you can need to get them soft or firm. don't be surprise if you sleep for a couple weeks lol. The rooms are a little pricey at times, so make sure you get your Club Carlson rewards card and keep track of your points because they build up pretty fast compared to other rewards cards. Also you can use points plus cash which will give you a really good rate on the room when they are high. I have had a problem once with one of the members at the front desk, but the general manager Ted can't remember his last name offhand. Resolved the issue very fast and efficiently. I Recommend this hotel to anybody either staying for a long period of time or passing through.  One thing I forgot to mention is the restaurant in the hotel called the (RBG Grill) is absolutely amazing. I recommend that you try there are hamburger, it is definitely one of the hidden gems in the valley.

I want to start off by saying do not stay at this hotel! Me and my family were in transition in between houses. We stayed there for about 40 days why you ask? I don't even know the answer to that one. Okay where to start for one there is police activity there almost every night. you will never ever get any sleep past 7 AM if it's not the maintenance guy running around with his loud ass garbage can then it is the front desk banging on people's door asking them if they're checking out. Now this parts gonna blow your mind, I had two rooms one for my mother and my children and one for me and my wife both over and under each other. One day we decide to have a sleepover our three-year-old daughter, we had a pullout couch in the room and that's where she was going to sleep. So I pulled out the pullout bed and there was a linen on it, but the worst part was the two syringes dirty syringes that fell out from in between the bed that my three-year-old daughter was going to sleep on let me emphasize was going to sleep on. So I called the front desk this was at about 12 AM, And he said that I would have to talk to the manager in the morning. I had called first thing in the morning and spoke to the assistant manager and she said she would notify the manager and have him call me. Two hours goes by and still no phone call so my wife gets on the phone and calls The front desk. And the assistant manager said that the manager would not have any time today to speak with me or her. But would love to comp our room for one night out of the 40 nights we are staying there. In which I said it was okay I would just contact corporate, but they still comped The night on my room in which forced me to take it. Then when I finally got a hold of The manager he had notified me that there's not even supposed to be a linen on the pullout beds which there was and they were dirty. Which means that subsequently the room that I was staying in that was supposed to be a clean was half fast and not cleaned properly which could've resulted in a very scary situation. I absolutely think that the hotel should be shut down or corporate should do internal investigation and make some changes because it's not being ran properly. I also feel that I should be compensated more than what I was for the incident that could've been a lot worse if it wasn't for me noticing those syringes.

I'm going to start off with the negatives and finish with the extreme positives.  So on Saturday me and my wife decided to order Olive Garden TOGO for lunch. We ordered our favorite appetizer which is the " Lasagna Fritta ". Hands down the best item on the menu. For our entrees, I ordered the " Tour of Italy " and my wife ordered the " Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo " which is the only thing we ever order because we have never had a problem with those dishes. We stand strong by that good old saying " If it's not broken, Don't fix it ". So 45 minutes later when our food was ready for pick up, my wife went and grabbed it. She got home 5 mins later with our lunch. We live right across the street from the Olive Garden let me point out. So it's not like it was a 20 minute commute. I opened the bag and everything was there which is always a plus. Then I open my food which was the Tour Of Italy, and I looked down in disgust. The lasagna was brown and mashed up, it also looked like they tried to cover up everything with cheese because the whole plate was covered with cheese to the point where I couldn't see my food until I picked up the chunk of cheese. My wife's Fettuccine was "Swimming" in Alfredo sauce. And the appetizer was covered in sauce and very rubbery. So I was completely unhappy and I called the Olive Garden and asked to speak to a manager.  NOW LETS GET INTO WHERE THIS BECOMES A EXTREME POSITIVE!!!!  I was put on the phone with the Manager on duty, His name was Marcus. Now I explained the situation to Marcus and he was very apologetic. He also off the bat asked if I would like my order redone. I explained to him that I wouldn't be able to as me and my wife had to go to work. So he said if one of us could stop by, that he would have a gift card waiting for us.   I couldn't pick up the gift card on Saturday due to me rushing into work. So Sunday me and my wife called Marcus and he said it was no problem we could come and grab it today. So instead of going to get a gift card we decided to go have dinner at Olive Garden.   We walked in and asked for Marcus. He came up about 1 minute later and I introduced me and my wife and he knew exactly who we were. So then he asked us to follow him. He asked if we were having dinner with them tonight and we said yes. Then he said okay perfect " I want to take care of you guys " he sat us at the booth near the bar, which is our favorite spot. Marcus brought us some menu's and said " ORDER ANYTHING YOU GUYS WANT, DRINKS, APPZ, ENTRÃ‰ES, AND DESSERTS ". He was buying us DINNER. Let's just say we had a lot of food lol and everything we had was AMAZING!! So his amazing hospitality didn't stop there. We were so full that we passed on dessert, and Marcus came over and said No Desserts??? We were like no thank you we were full. And he picked up the dessert menu and said pick two desserts to go. He was very adamant lol. So we got our desserts Togo with our leftovers and my wife loves the iced tea there so we always buy a gallon Togo. And he went back and made a gallon Togo for us. Marcus was going above and beyond for our dinner. And we were definitely impressed and pleased. That is why I gave them 5 stars because yeah they messed up but Marcus definitely handled the situation accordingly and we appreciate that in service.   THANK YOU MARCUS !!!!

This review requires very little, All I want to say is you have to eat here. Me and my wife are frequent customers and we recommend Mika's Greek to everyone we know. The food is absolutely amazing, like the melt in your mouth chicken souvlaki is a must. They also have the valleys #1 Greek salad in my opinion. Defiantly go for dinner tonight :-)

I love raising canes the food is absolutely amazing. But this location sucks definitely the worst location in the valley. One day I ordered a chicken sandwich three extra chicken tenders and I like everything crispy, first of all the girl asked me six times if I want it crispy. Then it only took 23 minutes for me to get my food. If I wasn't in such a rush I would've snapped and asked to talk to the manager but I didn't have time. I know I want to my food extra crispy, but 23 minutes that's a bit excessive. Either no it's the most convenient location to my work and house I will still drive the extra 5 miles to go eat somewhere else.

Been here several times now, and I have to admit that it is addictive and you should eat at your own risk lol. Let's start by saying that the owner Dave is a amazing guy and definitely treats and runs his business phenomenal. He has been there every time I've been there so that alone should tell you something, he greets all of his customers as he would his family with respect. And that goes a long way in my books. Now let's move on to the food... I have had almost everything on the menu and let me tell you it all is prepared exactly how it is supposed to be AMAZINGGG. My favorite is the Big D with a coney, You really get the best of both worlds with that sandwich. With my culinary background as being a chef let me tell you, I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT BETTER MYSELF AND THAT'S THE HONEST TRUTH!!!! I wanna finish off by saying thanks to all the staff at Detroit Coney for giving me and my family a wonderful experience every time

Me and my wife have ate there several times. We recently moved here from Toronto, Canada, and we have a big Caribbean community back home. Caribbean Palm is hands down the best Caribbean food in the valley, next to grandmas house. I have tried almost everything on their menu. I recommend their Curry Chicken dinner, it is phenomenal. They also have the best beef, and chicken patties. That's enough about the food now let's move on to the service. They are by far the friendliest people I have ever met in the industry, They do have thick Caribbean accents but that's to be expected if you want the real deal. Would defiantly recommend for everyone to stop by at least once and explore something new.

Previously I wrote a review about this restaurant in 2015, and it wasn't the greatest! But I always attempt to give restaurants second chances and I'm glad I did. Since my last review I have to admit that Gus's New York Pizza is getting better and better, and I'm not just talking about the food! I don't know what has changed in the last year, but even the customer service has gotten 100x better at this location. I still have my random mishaps but really its in college town so its bound to happen! The female manager is amazing ( Sorry forgot her name ) but she is definitely going above and beyond from what you expect from them! And a lot of us appreciate it so keep up the great work and please don't let me down, because I will edit it again lol EAT ON PIZZA LOVERS!

Everybody must eat here! I'm originally from Canada, and if you know what a poutine is then you know that us  "CANADIANS" have very high standards when it comes to poutine. Also on top of it I have a culinary background so my standards are so much higher. But US Fries blew me away from day one. Their food is delicious, authentic also is the closest thing to back home. But as the last reviewer said " They have had some serious mishaps when it comes to their employees " but let me tell you the huge turn around this restaurant has done in the last 3 months due to the manager. She has turned this restaurant upside down 100% and is making the experience better and better everytime. So with that said I want to say thank you to US FRIES for bringing us such amazing poutine to Arizona. But a real special thanks to the Manager for actually caring and pouring your heart, blood, and tears into the restaurant because it really shows.
