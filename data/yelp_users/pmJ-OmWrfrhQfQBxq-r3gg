I don't typically write a negative review, but you guys went from being my favorite store to me just making my purchase from Amazon online. Your smart mouth sales person at the door, letting us know we came in just at closing time did a wonderful job at making us feel stupid, not cool. If you are closed, then lock the door, if your salespeople have something to do, let them go early, but never poke your customer in the eye with a stick, cause, we won't be back.

Being from the Midwest, it is real treat to be able to dine outside in January. With the 75 degree temps today we decided to get out for dinner. Scottsdale has an abundance of eateries with patio dining, but we headed downtown and landed at the Tapas Papa Frita. Wow, what a great experience. We had a great table facing the waterway and the service was solid.   We had the Chef's Selection Tapas Platter, which may rank up there with one of our best meals ever. We started with Sautéed gulf shrimp with roasted garlic, Crab stuffed peppers, with a saffron sauce, Grill Tenderloin of beef brochette with adobo glazed, Flame-broiled lamb chops with seven herbs, Marinated Manchego sheep cheese, and Stuffed rosemary cream Medjool dates wrapped in apple bacon  The  Entrée was the ~ Valenciana Paella ~, A masterpiece of saffron rice with clams, mussels, shrimp, chicken, txistorra, peppers, onions & tomatoes. They say the Paella will be cooked in the same pan for the ultimate flavor and it was everything they promised, making for an over the top dinner.  At $45 per person, it was a bit pricey, however it was a wonderful dinner. The fact there was a full moon and a very lovely evening made for a great setting. Highly recommend Chef Joseph Gutierrez Tapas Papa Frita
