Found Sew Now through Yelp and figured I would take 5 button up shirts I had just bought there.  They were a little busy, due to prom approaching, but I was able to get out of there in under 15 minutes.  Price was great and the shirts were done quickly.  The fit on all the shirts was great.  Being a tall and skinny person(17.5" neck, 37" arms, 50" chest, 36x38 pants), I need to get most of my clothes altered and plan on bringing some bigger projects in soon.  The reason for a 4 rather than a 5 was because one of the shirts ended up with a slight tear (only 1/8th" long) in the shoulder that wasn't previously there.

My wife and I have been to Beckett's Table on two separate occasions and both have been extremely underwhelming.  1st Visit:  It was our weekly date night, Friday, and I schedule a reservation for 2 at 7PM.  We arrived approximately 5 minutes before 7 and were told that a table would be ready shortly and that we could order a drink from the bar while we waited.  We decided to wait to grab a drink until we were sat because it would only be a few minutes; boy were we wrong.  We waited outside for a few minutes before my wife got cold, in which case, we headed back inside to wait in the VERY cramped waiting area.  At about 10 past 7, my wife asked the hostess how much longer to expect for our table and she was instructed that they were just waiting for a table to open.  While we continued to wait, we saw several groups of individuals arrive and seated by the hostess before us.  As the clock continued to run, we grew increasingly impatient.  At 7:30, we began to get frustrated, but we decided to wait because of the glowing reviews we had received from friends.  As it approached 8PM, we were ready to head out the door, when the hostess, finally, told us our table was ready.  We were sat at a 2 person table near the kitchen.  On this visit, I ordered the short ribs and my wife ordered the cast iron chicken, which were both good, however, our experience at the front of the house really soured our experience.  When I schedule a reservation, I understand that a restaurant will, likely, not be able to accommodate my party at the exact time specified, but it should be within a reasonable time frame.  At no point should an hour be a reasonable wait time for someone with a reservation.  The other frustrating part was that it seemed that they were waiting for a 2 person table to open up before seating us.  All the groups that we saw sat before us were 4+, which made the wait much more frustrating.  After this visit, we told ourselves that we would not return and that if we wanted Modern American-style cuisine, we would rather visit Chelsea's Kitchen or Rusconi's because their food quality is comparable and their service is significantly better.  2nd Visit:  We vowed to never return, unfortunately, we broke that vow and regret it.  Our friend had heard good things from other friends and decided she wanted to eat here for her birthday dinner.  We had a party for 10 and a reservation for 6PM on a Tuesday.  My wife and I were one of the firsts to arrive, 10-15 minutes early, and we were immediately taken to our table, which was the long bench on the East wall, with tables pushed together.  My wife and I ordered cocktails from our waitress and both came within a reasonable amount of time.  As more members of our party arrived, we all stood up to greet each person with handshakes or hugs and to say our hellos.  Well, that eastern-most table just happened to be next to the server station in the northeast corner of the restaurant.  Apparently, servers get very upset if you obstruct the most convenient pathway for them; not the only pathway, but the most convenient.  We had multiple servers get angry at us for blocking the walkway from the server station to the south part of the restaurant.  Don't forget that the servers could have easily walked west to the next walkway and head south.  This happened nearly every time we stood up to say hello or goodbye to someone.  Don't worry, that was not our only complaint this time.  We went ahead and ordered.  My wife and I both ordered the cheeseburger, both without the bun; she ordered medium and I medium rare.  I, however, ordered mine with a side salad, instead of the chips it normally comes with.  When the food came out, mine had no bun, but it had chips instead of the salad.  When I mentioned the lack of a salad, she brought one out, but forgot to bring the dressing.  My wife's came out with chips, but still had the bun, however, there were no toppings on the burger; no mustard, no pickles.  When she mentioned it, the waitress grabbed a couple of ramekins with the toppings.  Without a bun, I cut my burger with my fork only to find the burger to be brown throughout. My wife's burger was exactly what I would expect, slightly pink inside.  Finally, I bit into my burger only to find that it was overcooked and burnt on the outside.  At this point, I was over it.  Burgers are so simple to grill properly, yet, they seemed to find a way to mess it up.  It really did not help that the waitress seemed to have a snarky attitude every time we pointed something out or asked her for something.  We figured this visit might be different because the food and our waitress were good the first visit, but this time, was the opposite.  We have concluded that in order for this place to be considered good, every aspect of the restaurant has to be on their game and at this point, we haven't seen them able to put it all together.  We will continue to avoid this place, if at all possible.

My girlfriend and I stop into Pete's close to once a week as we cannot get enough of it.  We usually start off with either one of the egg rolls (I like the fried ones and she likes the fresh ones).  We always get a soup, we've tried them all, but like the coconut soup the best and have strictly ordered that the last few times.  For main courses, she always orders the Pad Thai, usually with chicken and shrimp, I rotate between the spicy noodles with basil, rad-nah, and the big fresh noodles.  The food is the reason we constantly come back, but like other Yelpers have stated, the service is pretty bad.  Robert, while we like him, seems to get lost, even though there are only 8-10 tables.  When Pu was there, it wasn't as bad and while they hired another waitress, she only works a few nights.  We have gotten used to the service though and know we need to get there an hour or so before we want to eat and we ask for a pitcher of water at our table.  I have been there for the buffet once, the price is very good and it can be a good introduction or expansion of your thai tastes.  I had never tried the different varieties of curry and this give me that opportunity.  Overall, the buffet is certainly worth trying out.  As for the heat levels, Robert is very good at explaining that Pete runs about 1 level hotter than other thai places.  While this is good, the heat levels vary from day to day.  I always order a 4; my girlfriend orders a 1 or 0.  There have been some instances where my 4 has had little to no heat and there have been instances where I ended up sweating, same with my girlfriend.  In fact, there was even a time where I tried her 1 and thought it was more in the range of a 4.  Keep in mind, if it is not spicy enough, there is a chili bar and you can add some prik nam pla for that added kick.  Overall, of the 15-20 times we've eaten here, we've only walked away disappointed once, which happened to be a few days ago.  We took our close friend there for dinner, ordered the coconut soup, he ordered the spicy noodles with basil and steak at a 4, my girlfriend ordered the pad-thai with tofu and shrimp at a 1, and I ordered the big fresh noodles with chicken at a 4.  The soup was amazing as usual, however, the dinners came out a little wonky.  His dish was fine, but my girlfriends dish came out with chicken and shrimp instead of tofu and my dish came out with the tofu instead of chicken.  We sent them back and got new dishes fairly quickly, however, these ones came out at 0s.  To the chili bar, we went and added some spice, then all was fine.  This one incident won't hurt our decision to return though, since, we hadn't experience problems the other times.

LSS: Asked for the top-of-the-line shave, ended up being cut 6 or 7 times, razor burn, missed portions of my face, and did not receive all the services ordered.  Was taken here by one of my groomsmen the morning of my wedding.  This was my first time at minibar.ber.shop and my experience was bad to say the least.  We arrived around 11am, put our names in and ordered a round of beers as we waited.  From what I understand, this is a new location for them.  The inside is very modern, with the bar area painted black and the barber area painted white.  I opted for the "top shelf" while my groomsmen went with "manzillians."  We only waited a few minutes before they called my name.  I was greeted by the barber and shown to his station.  I noticed early on that he seemed a little flustered because he started preparing me for a haircut, even though I was only there for a shave and the paper he was given concurred.  At this point, I probably should have gotten up.  He began the shaving process with the cleanser, then applied a hot towel.  He followed that with, what I can only assume was more cleanser, then applied another hot towel.  After the second hot towel, he applied the hot shaving cream and began shaving.  He started shaving with the grain on my right side at the end of my sideburn down my cheek.  After this first pass is when everything began to go wrong.  When he started near my nose and went towards my ear, on my right side, he was pressing so hard that he cut me 5 or 6 times along my lower cheek.  Mind you, these weren't your average nicks, these are vertical line roughly 2 inches long and about 1/4 inches apart.  He stopped to apply something to each spot, which I can only assume was intended to stop the bleeding.  He then continued on and finished my right cheek and jaw, then continued to my right neck.  He, thankfully, did not cut me on my neck, but did manage to give me some bad razor burn, to the point where 2 days later, it still hurt to put water on.  My left cheek went smoothly, but the left side of my neck was the same story as the right side, razor burn.  Then when he shaved my chin, he cut me again, roughly 1/2 an inch long on the top portion of the left side of my chin.  Overall, I ended up with 6 or 7 visible cuts on my face and some bad razor burn on my neck.  Thankfully, this was not my first straight shave because if it was, I would never get another, but I have had a dozen or so previously and have never been cut before.  Not only was the shave bad, but the barber certainly did not help his case.  Afterwards, he claimed that my skin was the problem and that some people cut more easily.  This complete lack of responsibility was disgusting and drove me to write this review.  Once I left his chair, I went back to the bar, where my groomsmen were sitting and told them we were leaving.  The lady at the front was very nice and apologized severely, but had no authority to rectify the situation.  She attempted to contact the owners in order to see what sort of compensation could be provided, but they did not answer the phone.  Ultimately, she was very saddened by the result and comped our beers and ONLY charged me for the manzillian.  I understand that she probably did not have the authority to give anymore discount and she probably stepped out of line compensating me that much, but the barber did not even perform all the services of the manzillian.  Being in somewhat of a time crunch, since we needed to go somewhere else for the groomsmen to get shaves, I ultimately paid for the manzillian and made sure she knew I was disappointed and would never return.  The only good thing about this experience was the $2 beers, but I went to get a good shave, not to get cheap beer.

Stopped in here for a quick lunch and a cocktail with my wife.  The wife ordered the Avocado and Pink Grapefruit Salad with a Trade Secret.  She loved every bite of the salad and every sip of her drink.  She liked the salad because it wasn't overly sweet, there was a nice balance.  I ordered the Wedge without lobster and a Spark Plug.  The Wedge was what you would expect, bacon, bleu cheese, tomatoes, but they also add summer squash and cucumbers.  These additions added a very nice variation to the standard wedge.  The Spark Plug is a bit strong in the beginning, but if you allow the coffee ice cube to melt a bit, it becomes extremely smooth cold brew coffee with creamer.  Together, we shared the coconut lemongrass ceviche.  I am known for getting ceviche whenever and wherever I can.  I can honestly say, this is one of the best ceviches I have had in the world. There is a nice sweetness to balance out the salty.  I will warn you though, there are fresh jalapeños, which will provide a kick, but this kick is balanced out very well with the sweet and salty.  The only issue we had was when our waitress brought my wife the wrong drink.  The waitress entered a watermelon mule instead of the Trade Secret.  My wife tried one sip of the mule and did not like it, but recognized it as having none of the properties the Trade Secret was said to have.  When the waitress was made aware, she quickly apologized and bright the correct drink within a few minutes.  Overall, the food was amazing, the service was good, but very responsive to questions and mistakes, and the atmosphere was good, but a little worn.
