So, this place was my absolute favorite Thai restaurant in Phoenix until today. The service was pretty slow for only having me, my friend, and another costumer in the restaurant. The food was cold when is was brought out to us -with no radishes like they usually put on them, and those make the dish!- My friend ordered medium hot, and she got no spice. She didn't even eat it! Plus the spring roll I ordered wasn't the usual one they serve, it was small and gross AND my friend didn't even get the sticky rice she ordered, the waitress still tried to charge us for it. Needless to say, they have let me down :(

So I cracked my phone, spider web looking get-up, but it still worked! So I was going to tough it out for a while till I found a cheap/safe way to get it fixed. Well I Yelped "iPhone cracked screen repair" and found Miles! Called him the same day it happened and made an appointment for the next day! He was super friendly and speedy! 90 dollars to fix the glass vs. 300 dollars for a new phone? Awesome deal! He also recommended a few awesome cases! I highly recommend Miles and his terrific service!   Well his Scion was pretty cool too!

My all time favorite sandwich shop in Arizona!! All the sandwiches I've ever gotten have not lacked in meat and sauce -without being too saucey- Seriously bomb!! I highly recommend the Sky Harbor!

Baristas aren't the friendliest, and for the price, their drinks aren't the best.  For around $4 I got a medium -which was pretty small- iced coffee that tasted like a watery Starbucks iced coffee with TOO much ice, there were seriously only three sips.
