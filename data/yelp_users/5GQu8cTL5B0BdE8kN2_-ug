The girls and I really like to go here after work (which happens to be 3pm or so), which means there is always happy hour and there aren't huge crowds. Ive been here on a Sunday, and it's crazy. This is why I love going after work...  Mondays are also a great drink special day, $4 margaritas, but make sure not to go too crazy, or you'll end up taking a cab home...which we have also done... but we always have fun!

Four peaks is my favorite Phoenix bar/restaurant. I'm always excited to visit (I used to live here). Sooo when they put in a four peaks in the airport, I was beyond thrilled. Layovers were now filled with good food and beer....well...kind of. I wish they had a full menu - the real restaurants have KILLER daily food specials. I've now been to the airport location 3 times and each time I have been rather disappointed. The soft beer read overflowing with gooey cheese at the freestanding restaurant/brewery can be found crusty and seemingly overcooked. Why? :( I thought it was a fluke until I ordered it three times.  No pasta salad (four peaks literally has the best pasta salad on the planet. Think creamy, ranchy pasta with big chunks of artichokes and cheese...so good). No pizza either (go to the non-airport locations and order the pesto pizza-it's amazing). So alas, we are left with beer bread and burgers. Yeah, they're good but please stop over cooking my beer bread. And for the love of all things good please please start serving pasta salad!!!  Side note - this place still gets two stars because the beer remains consistent (but how could it not). Try the peach ale or hefeweizen. When in doubt, go with oatmeal stout :)
