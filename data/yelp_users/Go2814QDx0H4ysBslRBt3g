My hubby and I celebrated our first wedding anniversary by staying at the Royal Palms Resort. We journeyed windy walkways surrounded by manicured lawns, beautiful trees and blooming flowers. Our casita was lovely, private and had an incredible view of Camelback mountain. The staff surprised us by delivering a plate of yummy chocolates that said Happy Anniversary on it. We enjoyed a delicious dinner at romantic, Mediterranean T Cooks. We relaxed in the jacuzzi under the stars. The service at the hotel and the restaurant was impeccable-everyone was very friendly favorite person was James-the bellman-he has been there many years and really knew the history of the resort. We enjoyed the intimacy of this smaller resort-it was a memorable celebration, worth the investment and we plan to go back.

HORRIBLE Quality and Customer Service! My issue is not with the store on Bell Road but with their Service & Repair Dept and the Protection Plan from Ultra Shield they sell. After our house fire we purchased almost an entire home of La-z-boy furniture ($15,000) because it is one of the few places that still is made in America. I am sad to say the quality of the furniture has declined horribly since my parents generation! Within a few months-the recliner chair we bought broke-the seat bottomed out and one of the recliners in the reclining sofa broke. (we have no children crawling around on them!)  They got someone out to look at it, but then heard the part wasn't in and would be another 6 weeks! After 15 calls to them and FOUR MONTHS-they finally took the seat from another chair in stock!  We also bought rugs with an extended warranty by Ultra Shield because we have pets. The warranty covers pet stains. At first Ultra Shield was prompt and got a serviceman out to clean the rug-(each rug had its own protection warranty) but after two days the stain reappeared. I called them back and spoke to them about one of the rugs, they asked me to take photos, which I did. This one rug they agreed to replace after cleaning it twice. Here is the catch-the item is not in stock-so they would need to order and it would be TWO MONTHS before we got it-then they wanted us to pay for half the shipping because we are moving out of state! I refused and after much discussion they agreed to pay for it. Now the other rug is another story. After they came out and cleaned it they called me to follow up. My husband was in the hospital and very sick -so calling them back was not a priority for me. With each message she left me-she got mean and threatening. My husband came home from the hospital after a week and life resumed. A few months later I called again to have the rug cleaned and they told me because I never called them back the warranty was now VOID! She kindly advised me the rules are in the fine print of the warranty we bought! Funny how in all her nasty calls to me she never mentioned that the warranty would be voided due to my not returning a call!  I will NEVER buy La-Z-Boy furniture or an ULTRA SHIELD protection plan! I suggest you don't either!

Dr Ryan Ainsworth has been caring for all the furry critters in my family for several years. We are thrilled that he has his own practice now. Even though we live in Peoria-he is worth the drive to Gilbert! We trust Dr. Ainsworth completely and love that he integrates wellness (acupuncture and nutrition) into the care of our "babies".

I love Cerreta's! They make the most yummy caramels, sweet pralines and awesome chocolate mints.  The factory feels like stepping back in time. I always try to support locally owned businesses over chains and Cerretas is family owned and operated! Support local and stay sweet!

Amazing service by Levi! I called him on a Sunday-I live in the West Valley and his phone # is East Valley. He was at my home in 40 minutes and re keyed all the locks to my home in an hour! Thanks Levi for you fast response, quality work and for helping me feel safe again! I highly recommend him!

I have hosted lunches here for The Conscious Community for the past year and Cindy, the owner and the wait staff have always done an excellent job catering to our needs. The food is fresh and yummy. They offer gluten free items that are incredible. I also went to dinner there one night when I was on the East side of town and was amazed at the gourmet offerings, paired with a great wine list. Cindy and her husband make you feel welcome. You'll be glad you tried it!

My hubby and I came in here to buy some pastries for a friends birthday. They have a beautiful display of hand made European cakes, cookies and pastries.  Along with the treats for my friend, We also ordered a Black Forest  sub sandwich, loaded with ham and cheese, crisp lettuce wrapped in fresh baked bread.  The bread was so good we bought a loaf for home. The owners were friendly and made us feel welcome. Will definatly be back.

I had taken my car into AAA for a 36 point inspection. They told me they found $2700.00 worth of work that needed to be done and soon! I decided to get a second opinion and I am so glad I did!! I researched on YELP and found Ken from KARS. I called him up-he got me in right away, I  took the list from AAA-he looked at all of the issues and told me that I only needed one thing done!!! He saved me $2600! Wow-what a find Ken is! Honest and friendly! I highly recommend him!
