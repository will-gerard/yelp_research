I'm happy to report that the food here was fresh, abundant and varied. Often times with buffets  you never know what you're going to walk in to. But I was pleasantly surprised and happy with the offerings.  For about $16, my dad and I enjoyed the buffet and two drinks. We chowed down on salad, soup, pizza, tacos and dessert. Well not ALL of that, but those are the options available.   What really makes this location special is Barbie. She walks around clearing plates and offering refills on soda and coffee. She is truly a sweet heart. Extemely friendly and outgoing. I would drive all the way to this location just to experience her kindness. She works on Tuesdays, FYI!

Of the three different music supply stores I stopped in, Central Music is the only one I would go back to.   Their selection of music is extensive and their staff are friendly. If they don't have what you're looking for in stock, they will either download it for you on the spot or have it delivered in a few days.   I like that the staff left me alone to search through the racks. I never felt like someone was hovering over me but I always felt like there was someone available to help.   The racks are extremely easy to understand and locate what you're looking for. And of course they have step ladders every to aid the vertically challenged.   Happy music making!

You know that person (I won't say girl, just to avoid sounding sexist)  who walks into a hardware store with that look on their face that just about screams: "I don't know what the hell I'm doing"?  Yeah, that was me. The staff here were extremely helpful, they knew exactly what I needed and where to find it. The gentleman helping me even opened the box and made sure it was the exact size item I needed.  The whole trip took about five minutes. Easy.   Would definitely come back.

What a beautiful experience. The views, the atmosphere, the perfect weather and good company plus good wine.   He and I came here at around 4 on a Sunday and had our choice of tables on the patio, there was only one or two the tables occupied. If you can, you simply MUST sit along the railing outside. You are treated to a beautifully unobstructed view of the valley and mountains in the distance.   Overall we had a really lovely time and would definitely return. However. The service left something to be desired. The girl taking care of our table was very sweet but seemed extremely unsure of herself and made things a bit uncomfortable. She didn't know much about the wine list (granted, it is huge, but still) and was awkward opening the bottle we selected. The cork ended up being rotted so we were able to get a new bottle which a gentleman opened for us. He was much more sure of himself and made us feel more at ease.   By around 6:30 it started to fill up outside, so be aware of when you get here to pick out the best table.   Cheers!

This place is beat.  It's the size of a normal Ross, but has way less than half of the stock of a normal Ross. It just looks picked over and sad. I dont understand what's going on here... Are they going out of business? Clearing for new inventory? Stocking up for the Zombie Apocalypse? Who knows.   Never returning.

I used to make fun of this place as a teenager but secretly buy everything here. I'm pretty sure everyone did that in high school, right?  Well now I'm an adult or whatever and I stopped in to pick up some things for a party. The girls working here are spunky, fashionable and extremely nice. They were friendly and helpful and also went away quickly when I just wanted to browse.   The prices are a bit high for what you're getting, but that's nothing new.

I don't really shop at Barnes and Noble anymore now that I have a Kindle growing out of my hand. But I used to work for one a million years ago when I was a youngster in college, the golden glow of my youth when I got angry at housewives asking about the new Dan Brown book, had I heard of it? UGH.   The fiction section of this store is comedically small. It's almost an afterthought, tucked way in the back corner like an accident.   But fear not, you can get a latte and a bunch of games and random crap that has no literary, or educational value whatsoever. Yippee.

I enjoy this movie theatre. It's clean, the seats are comfortable,  the staff are friendly and they sell reusable cups. Bring the cup back and your soda refill is only $1. Pretty sweet deal. What else is there to say?

I don't normally write reviews about fast food joints... In fact, I don't normally EAT at fast food joints.   I pulled into the drive-thru for a quick chicken sandwich before a movie. I ordered my food, nothing crazy, just a crispy chicken sandwich with a little ranch added. I pulled up behind a car at the second window and then WAITED FOR TEN MINUTES. I know that isn't a huge amount of time, but what the hell were they doing in there? It's McDonald's! It's supposed to be super fast! When I finally got to the window, it was then another almost five minute wait. I asked the guy what was going on and said "there was a mixup with my food". Huh? You mean my lonely little chicken sandwich with ranch and pickles? Jeez, sorry to confuse you all!  Well, i finally got it, with like 5 minutes to spare before my movie. There was barely any ranch on it and it was cold. Blech.  This just reinforces why I never eat at crappy places like this. I guess it's my own fault.

You can enter this shop as yourself and leave as whatever you want. The options are nearly endless. There are costumes for purchase and also for rent, and all of the staff working are friendly, creative and totally nuts.  The costumes are pretty well organized by genre and theme, just scan the labels on the shelves of each aisle to determine what you're looking for. All of the bigger stuff, or more delicate and expensive is up high and you need help to get them down.   When I was in high school, we used to use this shop for plays and shows and now that I'm an "adult" I come here for Halloween and theme parties.   Most recently, I needed a Super Hero costume for the Yelp Helps party. The selection for women wasn't all that extensive, but I found a Super Girl suit that fit perfectly! **See Picture**  The reason for the star deduction- some of the costumes are in pretty rough shape. It's natural, when you have people taking them to parties and doing all sorts of God knows what in them... but I think some of them need some serious work if I'm going to pay good money to rent them. I wanna look good, damnit!  Happy costuming!

Jolta Java. I've had you on my radar for a few months. I remember stopping by once a few years ago and had a pleasant experience. This time... Not so much.  The coffee drink I got was tasty, and I'm very happy that they carry both almond milk AND soy milk for us lactose intolerant folk. This is where my happiness ends.  This place needs a SERIOUS deep clean. The floor was covered in crumbs, the tables were littered with debris of various food and paper products. The fake plants were dusty and if you look up to their massive ceiling, all the huge pipes are COVERED in dust. It's an asthmatic nightmare. People would finish their beverage or food and then the table wouldn't be cleaned for a minimum of ten minutes.  The staff were completely apathetic to all of this. It wasn't busy, so they stood around behind the counter either looking at their cellphones, chit chatting, or watching the Olympics. Sad customer service.   The more I type out, the more I realize that this shop needs more than a cleaning. It needs an attitude and staff adjustment.   I doubt I'll return.

I can't say I'm much of a fan of this shoe store. The prices are pretty high and.. This may seem mean.. But they only seem to carry "old lady shoes". For all the times I've wandered in here, I have never actually felt drawn to any one pair. I always leave empty handed.   Recently, they just got in their Fall boot selection, and there are actually a few pairs I would buy, and the prices are actually pretty good! Right around $100.  So, basically, if you're 55+ and have money to blow on overpriced flats, this is the shoe store for you.

I seriously love this store. I wish I didn't live so close because I always find myself here without even realizing it.   I can always find something here that is awesome. I pretty much never leave empty-handed. They have some really great deals and prices on clothes, shoes, accesories and purses.  Their high end stuff is still kind of ridiculous though. But that could just be my broke-ass opinion.

What a great place this is. I've recently become obsessed with sushi. I used to hate it, now I crave it on a daily basis. I want to eat everything with chopsticks... pizza... hotdogs... soup. whatever.   I was really in the mood for something spicy and I'm totally over the chain "Japanese/sushi" establishments, i really wanted something authentic. Yelp to the rescue!   It was a Friday night at about 8:30 and they were packed, I take that as a good sign. If the food is that good, I don't mind waiting. I was able to use my time to read the menu and decide on my meal.   My seat at the sushi bar was great. The chefs are so animated and alive. They all talk to each other in a funky mix of Japanese and English while they make your meal.   I started with the potstickers and they were delicious. Flavorful and hot and the perfect moistness, tenderness and crispy bottom. Perfect! Loved the scallion soy dipping sauce.  Then i had the Crazy Roll. This is shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, avocado and cucumber. Huge and fresh and great. Could definitely have been way spicier for me, but I guess that's what wasabi is for.   I would definitely come back and try everything else!   One glass of wine, one appetizer and one roll = about $25 with tip. Not bad!

Bowling? Sure why not.   For about $40, the two of us had unlimited bowling plus shoes on a Saturday night. Not too shabby!   This joint is clean, up to date and well run. Which is huge! Considering how most bowling places are falling apart and operated by swamp people that collectively have 17 teeth.  You've got your fun colored lights, trendy music mixed with oldies, lots of operating TVs playing music videos, game room, food and beer. The patrons were a happy mix of young, old, families and pros.   My only complaint is the ball selection. They're color coded to make it easy to find the weight you're looking for, but the finger holes are pretty much the same size within each weight. Meaning you have to have tiny little girl fingers to use the lighter weights or massive bear hands to use the heavier ones. I kinda fall in the middle and had a hard time finding a ball that I liked. Uh... That's what she said?  I would definitely return!

Sometimes it really doesn't matter what the food is like when the people are just this awesome. My coworker and I came here for a quick lunch the other day and were greeted as if we were old friends. The Lunch Bag is a family run place with mom, daughter and son working the counter and making the food.   They were laughing and joking with customers that they clearly knew very well. We felt like we were really apart of something fun and special.   The food was good too and a decent price for lunch. I had the New Yorker (minus the cheese) and it was super tasty. I would get the coleslaw on the side if you don't like soggy bread but otherwise would totally eat it again.   Absolutely will return.

I can't stop staring at my nails. I know it's probably vain, but they just look so good! My eyebrows too... What's that song...? Oh yeah! I'm sexy and I know it!   They really do a fantastic job here. Efficient and friendly, and very professional. Christine did my gel French manicure and I will only go back to her now.   It's a bit pricey, but since it lasts almost three weeks, and dries before you leave, it's totally worth it!  They take cash and card, but tips are cash only.

Delia's is on point. They know what they're doing, they're fast and organized and the price isn't too high. My family has been bringing clothes to this location for years and have never had an issue. Keep it up, Delia's!

Jack in the Crack. Good lord, seriously? I hate living so close to this place. When I was living on the East Coast, I would go into Double Cheeseburger denial and get the shakes. Now I've moved back here and pretty much always end up in line ordering a meal after a night of drinking. With a Dr. Pepper and curly fries with ranch on the side NOW. I mean PLEASE... please... not NOW, that's just crazy and rude.   I very rarely get a crappy burger. They really do make everything right when you order it. The bun is nice and soft, the cheese is actually all melty and the burger patties are hot and juicy. The fries are crispy, hot and well seasoned. For a fast food place, Jack in the Box totally wins.   I don't even want to think about the amount of fat, sodium, calories and evil I'm ingesting when I eat here because it's just so damn tasty. Oh well.

So the only reason I ever stop in at this particular Starbuck is because it is on my way to the gym and I almost always need a Double Espresso to get me through the cardio.  I always, always... always get the same thing. Doppio with no lid, and then I ask for the soy milk. It's kind of a bummer to me that they don't remember. I'm not expecting it or think I'm special or anything, but I've seen two or three of the baristas every time i go in. Hmph. My mom always told me I was special...  Beware when there is a line. The Scottsdale Mommies or whoever they are get all in a tizzy when their Venti Black Tea Lemonade is made with Green Tea instead. I mean REALLY, i TOLD him Black Tea. Wasn't he listening??   Yuck.  As a side note. There is always a very cute guy with a beard sitting outside working on his laptop. Just sayin'.

I genuinely feel bad writing a negative review about this restaurant because I totally get it... being a server in a badly run, poorly designed restaurant sucks. It's not the server's fault but.. still.. this place sucks.  Ambience: in a word? Awkward. It was nearly empty on a Saturday night. Probably because it's stuck way in the back corner next to a chiropractor's office. The lighting is much like a doctor's office, overly bright in an artificial way. The music is canned muzac... again like a doctor's office. And the layout of the place is terrible. The sushi station is in the center with a small bar and the booths line the way facing the bar. So basically the booth people are staring at the back of your head if you're at the bar. There are a few random tables on either side of this strangeness.   Service: Clueless. Was the guy who seated us our server? Or is the sushi guy our server? Who do we order drinks with? Who do we order hot food/sushi from? So confusing. They seemed just as confused as us because when we ordered from the sushi guy, he clearly was annoyed and said he'd "Take care of it"... uh ok.. thanks? Then we ordered some hot food which... never came. Until I asked for it, which of course was too late.   Food: Good enough, but not good enough for me to come back.   I don't know how Sushi Ko stays in business considering how they're hiding in the corner of the Chompie's shopping center, especially with such poor service and atmosphere. Pretty much what I'm saying is, go to Hiro Sushi down the street and just endure the wait. They have a wait because they're good at what they do.

My dog, Riley, is a total disaster of a dog. She's so pretty, but there's not much there in the way of smarts. But we love her!  So when she was bitten by a rattlesnake, I of course raced her here for treatment. The staff are extremely knowledgable, smart, friendly and forthcoming with information. They told me upfront that this was going to be expensive and all the different options. No beating around the bush, nothing vague or general, just to the point. It was great, totally got the hard part out of the way.   She was treated with kindness by people who obviously love animals. Yes, it was expensive, about $1700, but obviously completely worth it.   So remember when I said Riley isn't the smartest? Yeah, well two days after the rattler incident, she ate a bottle of midol. I again found myself back in the clinic. Most of the staff remembered her and treated me and her with the utmost in professionalism and concern.   That was another $650. (I love my dog.. i love my dog...I love my dog .. I keep reminding myself...).  Oy. Well anyway. I would reccommend this clinic to anyone with a pet in distress.

I'm over the moon with happiness over my new piercing. I couldn't be happier with it and with the whole experience of getting it done.  Ana answered every question I had and more. She made me feel so comfortable and empowered. She is truly talented at her craft, knowledgable and professional to the core. She explained every step she did and was the utmost of sanitary, sterile and clean. I mean honestly, what a fricken rock star.  Not to mention her sexy accent.   The prices for the piercing and the jewelry were perfect, the shop is beautiful and clean, the staff are incredibly friendly and open and the whole process was swift and efficient.  I seriously cannot express more positivity about this shop and my experience here. I will recommend anyone I know who is looking for a peircing or even just advice about one they already have.

Ladies shoot and rent for FREE on Fridays! (Still have to purchase ammo, but duh, that ish ain't free.)   I had a good experience coming here with my two guy friends. The employees were knowledgeable and respectful. Even though I'm not very familiar with shooting ranges, I never felt spoken down to or made to feel uncomfortable in any way for being a woman in a "man's world". In fact, there were more women shooting than men. There was always someone monitoring the lanes and available to offer advice or assistance.  Don't forget to clean up your shells and don't be an ass. That's pretty much it.

This place is terrifying. If you're scared of clutter, I would stay miles away. If you're allergic to dust. Stay away. If you like searching through miles of random bric-a-brac and haggling then you'll love it.  This is definitely the place to find unique, random and interesting things. If you need it, they have it. Have fun searching!

This theatre is a mini, modern looking Metropolitan Opera house. I'm pretty sure it was designed with the same shape and space in mind, but with less tiers and no swarovski crystal chandeliers.   I came here last night for the death cab for cutie concert and had a great time! Everything about the experience was easy and pleasant.   Parking: there is a garage behind the building that is $5 per event. It is large and easy to maneuver.   Willcall: fast and simple. Give them your name and ID and receive a ticket, pretty standard. Located to the left of the entrance and beyond the concession counters.  Performance space: comfortable and spacious! The ushers are very friendly and efficient when guiding you to your seat. The rows themselves are so wide, you don't have to move much when someone is walking by you to their seat. Unless you or them are really big I suppose...  The performance itself: varied and interesting light design. The sound could have been at bit louder for my taste, but it did make for easy conversation if you chose to talk during the music.   The building itself is beautifully designed, and as others have mentioned, the water feature outside is very nice, with tables and chairs surrounding it for extra lingering and relaxing in nice weather.   For concessions, we ordered two beers and a double captain and coke. This came to $22, not cheap, but not breaking the bank either.   I would definitely return for more concerts!

There is pretty much always a wait on the weekends. It's a very popular spot, and for good reason. The food is great, the atmosphere is nice and the service is swift.   I like how light and airy the room feels, everything is white and spacious so even though it's 3,000 degrees outside, it feels cool inside. The service was a little cold, and at times we weren't really sure which girl was assigned to our table, but everything worked out so it wasn't that bad.   I would definitely come back.

I am a cigar novice, a newbie, you could say. My boyfriend is pretty much an expert. And God is it sexy when a man smokes a cigar while sipping on cognac.  Is it getting warm in here..?  Ok. So he comes here all the time and loves it, I've only been in once or twice, but never really paid that much attention. This time is for me. I'm buying my first cigar.  The lounge area was pretty full of friendly people who all said 'hello' when we entered. We perused the shelves for a bit since we had a pretty good idea of what we were looking for.   After a bit, one of the friendly gents introduced us to the owner, Scott. He liked my selections and made another recommendation of his own. He even introduced us to a vendor who had just arrived.   Overall, the staff are incredibly friendly and knowledgable, and from what I can tell, the selection and price are great as well.  As a girl who's never smoked a cigar before, I felt very comfortable and well taken care of here. I will definitely return.   Oh, and my cigar was awesome. **See Picture**

I can see myself coming here a few times a month, easy.  The dark atmosphere, the live music, the wine, the finger foods, the great service, these all add up to a fantastic evening. The company I was with  just made it that much better.   Let's put it this way, I just moved to Scottsdale from Manhattan about two weeks ago and I had already heard about Kazimierz from at least three different people. With such a great reputation from word of mouth alone, I had to come check it out.   We told our cocktail server that we were looking for a bottle. Specifically a Cabernet blend with either Shiraz or Petite Syrah. She offered her suggestion of the Australian Cab/Shiraz blend called The Scribbler at $35, and after a quick taste, we went for it and loved every drop.  The only thing I didn't care for was volume of the band. Perhaps it was because we were too close to the front, but they were pretty loud. It made conversation difficult, I found myself shouting at times.   The service is great, they're on top of things without constantly interrupting your conversation.   The bathrooms are neat and tidy as well! I love me a clean bathroom, who doesn't?   You'll definitely see me here on a regular basis.

Really not all that happy with the experience we had tonight.   We were told to move lanes three different times.   First time: we were placed too close to the league games and might disrupt them, so we were told to move ONE lane over. Huge difference, I know.  Second time: the lane they moved us into was broken somehow. The computer kept glitching and getting off sync with the game.  Third time: the computer screen worked but the overhead tv did not.   It's a strange environment, there are signs for food EVERYWHERE. On the walls, on the booths, on the tvs,  in the bathroom. I mean seriously. It's creepy. And then you look at the leaguers and suddenly realize why they're all overweight. You can't even call it subliminal messages because they're so overt and in your face.  Everything here is shabby and old, which I guess that's what bowling is... But does it have to be that way? Especially for the money we all pay? I mean come on.

No, but seriously, I love this place. I would eat here everyday if I could.   Either eating in, or taking it to go, the food and service is stellar. I've had a couple different appetizers and entrees and I've narrowed it down to two favorites. The Siamese Kisses app is fricken delicious and the Pad Thai is :drool: amazing.   They do their spice level from 1 to 5. 1 being no spice at all and 5 being Thai hot. Ive ordered the Pad Thai at a 3 and a 4 and I think I prefer the 3. Level 4 is definitely manageable but it kind of burns the tummy afterward.. Which is just slightly unpleasant.   I absolutely love eating here and consider them my "go to" for dining out. They also have a rewards card, which for every 200 points, you get a gift card. They also send you stuff for your birthday and anniversary.   Yummmmmmm!

Wanna go to....uh... Whuzza place... The one widda Christmas lights and stuff? Uhhh.. :hic:... Coach house! Yaaaaa riiiiight. :burp:  Goes our conversation after bar number two or three. I never start my night here, we always end up here somehow. Either by cab or rickshaw or bike or golf cart. All signs point to Coach house when you're wasted. Followed by Philadelpha Sandwich Co, which you can stumble to if you're up for the walk.   Even if it isn't Christmas when the place is light up for the world to see, Coach House rocks. Inside is small, but there's a small bar outside as well. The only time I've ever had to wait to get in was when the Fire Marshall was there making a show of keeping the numbers down inside. Something about safety and fire hazards and other such nonsense.   Bring money for the jukebox! And don't be an idiot or you'll get kicked out. Scratch that... Just don't be an idiot.

No, thank you, but no. Here's the short of it: the sushi took FOREVER and it came out mushy, falling apart and zero flavor.   We sat at the bar hoping to just grab a couple of rolls and a drink before heading out for the night. It was definitely crowded so we were lucky to find two seats together. This is the hang out for the young Elite Scottsdale douche and his girl, so lots of 30,000 dollar millionaires.   He ordered a safe Captain and Coke and I made the mistake of ordering a dirty Absolut martini. It was awful, it was weird tasting, I can't even accurately describe it. I drank it so it would go away. I obviously did not have another.  So our food finally comes out. We ordered a shrimp tempura roll and a spicy tuna roll. They were HUGE. I hate that, how the hell am I supposed to eat this? The chop sticks could hardly even hold the weight and size of the thing. So I pick it up... it falls apart. So that answers the "how do I eat this thing" question. The answer is: AWKWARDLY.   Blah blah, I could say more but in the end, it's just not worth it to come here. The food sucks, the drinks suck, the atmosphere sucks.

Hey buddy, I was pleasantly surprised with this little joint.   It was my first time at the rodeo, and the guy behind the counter explained everything on the menu so a little pigeon head like me could totally dig it.   I chowed down on the Thai Dymamite with steamed chicken instead of fried, cuz momma don't need any more junk in the trunk. It was pretty good, brown rice of course of course. Not nearly spicy enough for sure. The spring roll appy was mighty tasty as well, crunchy and hot in all the right places.   The style of the place is hard to pinpoint... It's not quite a chipotle, but not a sit down. You order and pay at the counter, they give you a number and then bring your comida to you. Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.  Definitely, and I mean definitely, check out the ridiculous soda fountain. It will knock your ever living socks off.

Absolutely beautiful church, moving sermon, impressive music and warm and inviting congregation.   For anyone looking for a new church to join, please consider Saint Barnabas on the Desert Episcopal Church.   The church's namesake, St. Barnabas, was loved and revered for his openhearted acceptance of the Jews and Gentiles into the church during a time when this was unacceptable to the general population. His name (though disputed) is known to mean "son of exhortation" or "consolation", due to his wonderful sermonizing. This past Sunday's sermon focused on loving your enemy and hating the sin, loving the sinner.   Taking a moment to think about the martyrdom of Saint Barnabas allows for reflection on freedom of religion and loving the sinner and hating the sin.

We decided not to order from Malee's because we wanted something a bit cheaper. God, that was a mistake.  I ordered the spicy chicken combo. I asked for noodles instead of rice. Crazy.. I know.  Pick up the food, take it home, open the container, get immediately pissed off.   They didn't mix the noodles with the chicken and sauce and the noodles were so overcooked they might as well have been liquified. And I swear to God, they were spaghetti noodles.  (white people problems.. Yeah yeah yeah)  I was so grossed out and annoyed that I didn't eat any of it. I hopped in the car and went straight to Malee's where they know how to cook noodles.   My boyfriend ended up eating the nasty, pathetic overcooked bland noodles the next day and he wasn't too thrilled with it either. And I quote "it's just something to eat".  Ps. They have a fish tank stuffed with two HUGE koi that hardly have any room to turn around. Is that the fish special? Or do they just enjoy animal cruelty.   NEVER GOING BACK.

Wandered in this jewel of a shop today during the Yelp Scavenger Hunt and wow! I can't wait to come back and buy some goodies. The owner is extremely friendly and is good at reading a person's tastes. He noticed my necklace and was quick to point out other Judaica I might like. He clearly loves his shop and all the items found therein. And boy is it full of colorful stuff!  It's a bit off the beaten path of Mill Ave, but certainly worth a stroll over.

This place completely underwhelms me.   At first glance, the decor seems cool, but then you sit down in a booth and sink four inches in the impression made from the hundreds of other asses that sat there. Not a pleasant thought. After that, you look around and realize that it's just an Asian version of Applebees or some other chain.   The service comes from a totally mediocre cute college girl with the personality of a tea cup. Adequate and boring, never really there but nothing you can truly fault her for.  The menu is absurd. It's huge and broken down into what seems like six unintelligible sections. Some of the sushi rolls are explained on the back, and inexplicably, some aren't. A lot of them have cream cheese, which in my opinion, is nasty.      Ive been here twice and both times I said I wouldn't come back, and yet I keep returning. I guess because it's easy and it's there. Between the dining area and the bar, definitely sit at the bar. At least the bartenders are fun to watch while they tweak out on whatever uppers they're on.

It's a massive jam jar full of delicious, hang over fixing, spicy, beery, Bloody Mary. It's topped with a pickle, olives, lemon, lime, sausage links and a damn breakfast sandwich. It's brunch, it's a snack, it's fucking amazing. I saw it sitting next to me, and I blushed like a virgin.  On a Sunday early afternoon, the place was lively and full of happy brunch folk. Great atmosphere for beers and food and watching whatever sports you like on tv. Everyone behind and around the bar was friendly and engaging in conversation, pretty much everyone felt like a friend.   I would totally come back! Again and again and again...

Here's everything you need to know:   A 16oz domestic beer is $8.25 A 24oz domestic beer is $11.25  Well ok, there's other stuff you should know too. The facilities are very clean and neatly organized. The staff are friendly and helpful and you never have to go very far to buy something to eat or drink. They smoking area is actually kinda nice, but not shaded and no misters (take THAT smokers!). There are bathrooms everywhere, and they're super clean! Never a line for the women's room... Whoa!  There's a ton of free parking and outside in Westgate, you have like five or six different restaurants to choose from.

Go Diamondbacks!   I've been coming to this stadium since their inaugural game back in 1998! I still sport my purple and teal hat to the games... I just can't get down with the Sedona Red. We had season tickets for the first three or four seasons and I remember when they won the World Series, my family nearly died with excitement. What a great year!  Even though I hadn't been to a game in quite a few years, the stadium hasn't changed much. Sure it isn't Bank One Ballpark anymore, but the people working here are just as friendly as ever.   Be prepared to shell out some cash for in stadium food and beer, but that's pretty standard at this point. If you're surprised to spend $7 on a hotdog, then you're too broke to go to a game. It's just the way it is.   One of the things I love about this stadium is the retractable roof. This past game we were lucky enough to have nice weather so they opened that sucker right up. Try to listen for the awesome music they play when it's opening. Very epic.   Baseball is still the All American thing to do and everyone should go to a game at least once in their life. Make it a dbacks game! BEAT LA!

I am In Love with Lux.   They have everything I have ever wanted in a coffee shop. Good coffee, great homemade pastries and food, desks to study, comfy chairs to relax in, open and airy atmosphere, friendly employees, clean bathrooms, indoor and outdoor seating, spacious parking lot, great music playing and a huge tv with sports. Holy crap, that pretty much satisfies everyone.   AND they serve booze! I mean, jeez. How can you not love it here?  Ps, it's a great place for a first date.

Look at this stuff... Isn't it neat? Wouldnt you think my collection's complete! Wouldn't you think I'm the girl... The girl who has.. Everything?  No? Ok.   To the mall!  I remember being a teenager at this mall, spending hours wandering, window shopping, wishing, gawking at boys and generally being awkward and pimply.   Things are slightly better now, ten years later. I'm less pimply, have no patience for wandering, and I'm certainly not a teenager. God, how I still gawk at teenage boys though.   As a wizened adult, I find myself at this mall with a game plan. I choose two or three places, I go there with my purchase in mind, I buy the thing and then I leave faster than a ... Than a... Tween running at the name of Justin Beiber.   You really do have everything you could want in a mall, the cheapo piercing pagoda, the obligatory hair extension thingy kiosk all the way to Prada and Gucci. Decent food court selections as well, with real restaurants on the outer edges.   Avoid like the plague on any major sale day. Or come equipped with steal toed boots and sharp elbows.

I've got to say, even after all the day drinking we did before stopping it, this place STILL was a disappointment.   I'll be honest, we only came here because Geisha had an hour and fifteen minute wait. Crazy.  There were four of us. Sitting on the patio. In the dark. Bring a flashlight, seriously it's dark. And something to stabilize the table... they wobble. Good thing there's no cutting involved.  My buddy and I ordered edamame to start, and then  the Crispy Spicy Tuna and the Spicy Shrimp and Scallops. The Scallops is $21!! We were a little hesitant at the price of just one item but to use his words "Oh man, we're in for a real treat!".  Out comes the food. The Crispy Spicy Tuna is FOUR pieces. Womp Womp. All it is... is crunch. No real flavor or spiciness. Just super hard and crunchy.  THEN the real joke comes. Our Spicy Shrimp and Scallops is literally ONE overcooked Jumbo Shrimp, TWO smallish scallops and four rice cakes sitting in a bowl of broth. I'll give them this, the broth was delicious. Super spicy and awesome. But the portion size is a joke considering the price. We were laughing hysterically at our gross overstatement of a "real treat".   Oh and the edamame was never brought out. Our server... Jennifer? Jessica? She was sweet and apologized and graciously removed it from the bill.   The bathrooms are super weird also. The sliding door is like wide open for the restaurant to see in to and I wasn't sure if i was supposed to shut it... strange. Each stall is closed, but you can see the urinals in the men's room as you walk in to the women's. Very awkward and not too clean.  I won't return.

Mediocre breakfast.   We were in the neighborhood and STAHHHRVING so we yelped away and found T.C. Eggington's. Awww what a cute name. And such cute decor. I simply must know where the waitresses got those high waisted pleated khaki shorts. Anyway.  I ordered two eggs over easy with bacon, english muffin and fruit and he ordered the strawberry pancakes.   My food was just not very hot, the bacon was super greasy and the muffin was cold with only a kiss of butter. It ate it all after covering it in Cholula (which makes anything good) and it was fine.  The strawberries on his pancakes had clearly been frozen and there was no sauce to speak of. It was all topped with about a liter of whipped cream making the whole thing more like dessert than breakfast.   Overall, the service was good, but the food came out slowly and wasn't worth the wait.   I would not return.

I have a very foggy memory of coming to this theatre when I was in high school. I seem to remember awkward, sweaty hand holding followed by being picked up in my parent's minivan. Eesh.  Well, all that aside. I enjoyed this theatre. It has an old school feel to it which just barely walks the line of shabbiness. The seats are newer in style, thank god. They're big squishy recliners.     The most important part of this theatre is they offer films not found in your traditional stadium seating, blockbuster, mega money theaters. That's a huge plus in my book.   Prices are pretty standard for the movies, not budget breaking, but not cheap either.  The staff here are extremely friendly!

My mother, sister and I are annoying. I recognize this and embrace it. We involve shopkeepers, cashiers, janitors, sales associates, servers and anyone else in the near vicinity  in our squabbles and lighthearted  disagreements.   Last night's dinner was no different. Our server Tony was great. He played along and totally made fun of us. We loved it.   Highly recommend making a reservation on the weekend as they get very full. I overheard a couple leaving saying there was a 50 minute wait without one.   The drink menu is full of fruity froo-froo drinks but they have plenty of wine choices and full bar for any other drinks. My sister loved her Lemon Drop Martini (ugh) and my Hendricks and tonic was damn strong.  We had the Stuffed Mushrooms to start and they were delicious. Loaded with garlic and butter and there were probably 15 of them!  The entrees are good, not amazing. I had the Lobster Carbonara, which isn't really a true carbonara but it was pretty good otherwise. They put snow peas in it which I find weird, but the lobster pieces were massive. For $20 (the most expensive pasta dish), they had better be!  If you order a 'classic pasta',  you get to choose another order to take home for free! What! That's the weirdest, coolest concept I've seen in a chain restaurant. Be prepared to walk out with tons of food.  Overall, pleasant experience.

My dog Riley offered to write this review, but she doesn't have thumbs. I'll interpret her barks for you all.  Riley- "bark bark baaaaaark woof". Translation- I love this park!   Riley- "woof howwwwwwlllll woof bark." Translation- The dogs here are soooo nice!  Riley- "bark ruff ruff woof." Translation- I love all the space to play and the water fountains. There's even bushes for me to sit in the shade. Sometimes I like to hang out in the Active Dogs side when I want to run around and play, and I can go to the Passive Dogs side when I'm feeling mellow.   Dog speak is a complicated language.

Animal. Style.   I see you baby, slathering my cheeseburger with special sauce and pickles and onions. And oh God, is that mustard in the burger?   How dare you! To think I would ruin such an amazing creation with a tomato or lettuce. No such healthy stuff here. Puh-lease.   Oh and the way I pour that Root Beer. Oooh baby, that's it. So refreshing.   Why do I make your fries so limp, baby? If I could change one thing about you, sugar, just crisp up those fries... For me?   We don't have to fight, just hand me that stack o napkins and everything will be all right. You know I love you.  Animal style.

Oh breakfast, you're my best friend. Let's be pals forever and for always.  Butterfields offers so many choices, it's almost absurd. You can choose between breakfast or lunch.. Although for me, it's no contest. Breakfast wins every time.   The skillet I ordered started with a hash brown base, topped with peppers, chorizo and avocado then topped with two over easy eggs. It originally came with cheese, but they left it off for me. This comes with your choice of pancakes or grits. I picked whole wheat pancakes. Sooooo good. Everything was delicious. Even the fresh squeezed OJ and I don't even really like oranges.   The service was very friendly and prompt. I could seriously eat just about everything on the menu. I can't wait to go back.

I really was not pleased with my experience here. I came in looking for diet pills to add to my workout regimen. What I did NOT come in for was a condescending lecture from the guy working here "educating" me on what is healthy.   I had come in once before to see if they carry my vitamin, which they did not. The guy working then was friendly and offered different information about diet pills. He was not condescending or critical or try to use medical terms I had no hope of understanding. This other guy, however, did all of that.   I ended up leaving empty handed because I honestly would have felt embarrassed to purchase what I really wanted to when he was suggesting so strongly against it. If your company wanted you to only sell one type of supplement, then they would only carry that one item.   I'm still very frustrated and embarrassed by the way I was spoken to. If I wanted to be treated like a child who needed a lecture, I would go back to my ex boyfriend.

Books, clothing, household items, furniture, records, jewelry, little old ladies maning the register, teenagers stocking shelves, men hauling in furniture.   I came here in search of the perfect Horrible Holiday outfit for an Ugly Sweater party and good Lord I found exactly what I was looking for. There is no shortage of little old lady clothes from the 80s and 90s in this place.   The only really annoying part is there is only one dressing room, stake it out early and try to beat anyone to it. Otherwise, like my experience, you'll be standing there with your Christmas clothes hanging in your arms wishing evil thoughts upon the woman on the other side of the fitting room door.   They also have discounts running at various times. I had an item with a green dot on it which made it %25 off! Hey why not!

They have a very organized system here. The receptionist was extremely friendly and approachable. She told me the wait would be about an hour and a half to two hours and was extremely appologetic about it. She was right about the wait, but as soon as I was admitted into the exam room the doctor was very quick.   They have an internet service that allows you to check the wait online but it was completely inaccurate. If you're unsure, you can always call the receptionist and ask.   While I did feel completely taken care of by the doctor and nurse, I felt that she was rushing because of the large number of patients waiting to be seen. There were some questions that I had wanted to ask but didn't because there wasn't really the opportunity to do so. I was able to ask the followup nurse.   For someone without insurance the walk in fee was $129, and and x-ray is $50.

This place is beyond gross. It's sad and pathetic, with sad and pathetic people gambling away money they clearly cannot afford to gamble away.   Our group was given $10 vouchers from the Yelp party we had gone to, which at first seems pretty damn rad! No. It's not.  The voucher must be redeemed by becoming a member of the nast-tastic casino. And of course, they put the redemption desk in some far off corner at the end of the maze that is this murky, foul smelling bed of sin.   After waiting ten minutes in a line of interminable length all while standing next to chain-smoking slots players, we decided these vouchers were simply not worth the ruin our souls would become by standing there any longer.   For the thirty minutes I was stuck in this hell hole, I was ogled and gawked at by disgusting men with huge bellies and no teeth, I brushed up against women (I think they were women) not wearing bras, their teats hanging to their knees, I inhaled so much stale cigarette smoke that I'm sure it took time off my life and waited in a drink line for a soda that took so long that I didn't even move up a foot.   I can't express to you completely how unfortunate this whole place is. Maybe some people can come here, block out all the people and the smell and sit down to win some money, but I can't. I was so overwhelmed by the sad state of humanity here that I wanted to go home and scrub myself in a scalding hot shower.

This gym is exactly what I need it to be: inexpensive and efficient. It's not the place for bells and whistles, so look elsewhere for the pool and sauna and juice bar.   I come here for the treadmill, the elliptical and a few machines in the ladies gym. When things are broken, they get fixed. The staff are friendly and always available for questions or advice or assistance.   The members are a mix of pretty people, meatheads, old dudes, wrinkly old ladies and everyone else.   I used to belong to one of those fancy, expensive, bells and whistles gyms and I ended up using the same machines I use at Golds. So for me, it's a no brainer.  Happy sweating!

Came here to get my peepers checked for a new prescription. After calling around, I discovered that this location is by far the least expensive. For a prescription renewal without insurance, the fee is $49. It's extra for the full eye exam.   Everyone I spoke with was extremely friendly. The technician who does the preliminary exam was extremely young, but he was professional and courteous and seemed like an expert at his job. The doctor was friendly and concise, she answered all of my questions in an easy to understand manner.  The gentleman who checked me out was super friendly and helpful. He cleaned and tightened all the screws and nose pads on both sets of my glasses (at no cost!) and explained what everything meant on my prescription.   I decided to purchase new glasses online and when I didn't know what something meant, I called in and he remembered me and helped me translate all the information.  The star deduction comes from the very high price of glasses in the store.

OooooooOOOOOoooh! Soooo soft and soooo pretty!  This is an ecstasy rave kid's fantasy, this store! With all the bright colors and soft fabrics, whether high or not, you're sure to be entertained by the glut of sensation.   Cathrine was very helpful with my questions and gave me all sorts of information, including the classroom schedule. She advised which class would best suit me and I can't wait to go and learn some new stitches!   The amount of yarn here is really overwhelming. It's easy to get off target and spend a boatload of money. A word to the wise, enter with a plan and a project so as not to go crazy.

The only reason I ever come way out this way is if I'm going to see a concert at Jobing.com Arena. I don't really see any other reason to. Sure, there are a bunch of restaurants, and  I think some shopping, but it's only there to kill time before or after a show.   The parking here is THE WORST EVER if you're coming for a concert. Especially if there is also a football game happening next door. There are a ton of people directing traffic, but none of them are aware of what the other is doing. We sat in one spot for, no joke, like 20 minutes. Meanwhile we could see a parking lot not even half full right next to the road we were stuck on. Once we finally made it into the parking lot, there was no discernible reason for the traffic besides the people directing it stopping it for their own amusement. It's a nightmare.  I almost decided to just say "fuck it" and leave because of the horrible traffic.  Leaving wasn't too bad, except you have the same problem but in reverse. The traffic directors trying to control traffic, and the drunk and tired people completely ignoring them. Then once you get onto a major road, they have half the lanes blocked off for no apparent reason.   Other than the terrible traffic, this place is all right. If you come on a night where there is a sold out show, be prepared for waits up to an hour and a half at every single restaurant.   Eat and pee before you get here and bring a flask and you're good to go.

My poor iPhone 4s screen shattered. It was devastating. And embarrassing! The apple store actually recommended MacMedia when I asked for alternatives to their expensive solutions.   The guys at MacMedia are super nice and easy to talk to. They really know what they're doing. The whole procedure took about an hour and a half. Luckily it's in a great part of town so I just wandered off in search of entertainment. And even when I came back and it wasn't finished, there's a couch you can hang out on.   It cost $135 to replace the glass and I bought an awesome new case at $35. Not too bad and now I can show off my phone with pride! Oh happy day!

Wow. I'm seriously impressed!   Redendo's had been popping up in my Yelp nearby Feed for a few weeks now and I kept meaning to stop by. I'm so glad I did.  I ordered a small Caesar salad, an order of garlic knots and a calzone to go. About 15 minutes later I walked out the door with a package of food that smelled like an Italian heaven.   The "small" salad was huge and fresh. The garlic knots were delicious, as was the side of marinara that came with it.   The real star is the calzone. I don't know what I was expecting, but this far exceeded any ideas I could have had. The thing is huge. It's basically a pizza folded in half. Mine had ricotta, fresh tomatoes, sausage and roasted garlic. Ridiculous. So good. I'm still enjoying it and I had the thing like three days ago!  All that was $16 and it lasted me about three days. Highly, highly, highly recommended!

This bar is very swanky and NYC in style, it really made me miss home. It has a pretty small interior bar area that never got too crowded on a Friday night and what looked like a spacious outdoor patio area.  The service wasn't the best and the drink I chose wasnt the best either but I'm willing to overlook these problems given how much I enjoyed just being there.   I have one gripe. What is with the stupid TV playing ESPN? It pretty much guarantees any man with even just a fleeting interest in sports is going to stare straight at the stupid tv and not at me. It took a long time to get my hair and makeup to look this way and I would rather he look at me and not at the game taped earlier in the damn day.   Bars, especially high end martini bars like this need to be bold and leave the TVs out of the equation. End rant.  I would definitely come back.

Bashas, my castle, my kingdom. I am the Duchess, after all.   There are a few simple things I require of a grocery store. Fresh produce, abundant organic and dairy free selections, alcohol, and all the things I like to buy *on sale*. Oh and a friendly staff don't hurt none either.   Bashas is my go to. I shop here pretty much exclusively. The sales are frequently rotated, up to date and seasonal.   It's important to shop local and support an Arizona based company and it helps that I enjoy shopping with them. Keep up the good work!

Pick out the girliest, most floral covered dress you own and put  it on. Make sure it's pink. Next, double check that you have pink nail polish, lipstick and blush. Ok you're all set.  Do you have a mom? Sister? Wife... Daughter... Aunt... Female caregiver...? Are they in the least bit girly and celebrating a birthday or mothers day or divorce or whatever?  This is where you take them.  You sip tea and nibble scones all while surrounded by pictures of the royal family, flowers, dogs, kittens, tea cups and other feminine knick-knacks. And of course, the hats. They have a basket of hats available to borrow for your afternoon tea. Some of them are clearly for little girls and are a little beat up, but there are plenty of nice new ones as well.  The tea menu is extensive and will satisfy any taste, available in small pots and large. I had the English Rose and it was delightfully light and aromatic.   The food offerings allow for both breakfast or lunch with savory and sweet options. And of course save room for the scones. The scones they serve are the highlight. They are served warm with clotted cream and strawberry jam, like in any good English parlor.  After you have had your fill of tea and scones, walk over to their little shop next door. In it you will find jewelry and hats, home decor, soaps and fragrances.  Quite the lovely experience, indeed!

I'm a firm believer that cooking an egg should take longer than 30 seconds. Also, it should not be formed in a perfectly round and oddly fluffy disk. And warm cheese that doesn't melt is disturbing. And sausage patties shaped to the exact same size as the egg disk is bizarre as well. Food just doesn't exist perfectly in nature like this! It's wrong!  Otherwise, the bagel was alright. Just know that the everything bagel is covered in rye seeds, which is weird.   The coke from the soda fountain was the best part of the meal. I was wicked hungover.

This theatre is old and musty and outdated. The rooms are small and not very well sound proofed. I remember coming here when I was in high school and clearly not much has changed since.  On the plus side, I think they're going to be re-doing it soon.

I am completely and thoroughly obsessed to the core with Pad Thai. I love all the different flavors and textures. I probably eat it about once a week. At least it isn't too horrible for you.   Thai House is my 'go to' Pad Thai place simply because it's less than ten minutes from my house. For a little over $9 you get a huge portion of Chicken Pad Thai, it usually lasts me for about two meals.   I always get it 3 out of 5 spicy, with extra peanuts. Sometimes they remember the peanuts, sometimes not, so I usually check before I leave.   Sometimes it's perfectly prepared with a good amount of sauce and tender chicken. Other times, it's dried out and and kind sad and pathetic. It's hard to tell when it will be a hit or a miss, so I just keep going back.   God, now I think I need Pad Thai for dinner.

Everone be starin.  My car is like new. Only a few days ago you would have thought it was tan, but once the dirt was washed away it's a sparkly white again!   Troy was the first person I met here, he asked me what I was interested in and prepared the perfect package for me. For $80 they cleaned the entire car. And I mean entire. They vacuumed and scrubbed and rinsed and soaped and wiped and God knows what else. It took like an hour and a half but when they were done it was shiny and beautiful.   $80 is kind of expensive for me, but it was completely worth it for how it still looks about two weeks later. So fresh and so clean clean.

Wowoweewow.  I've never been so fascinated and grossed out in a sneaker store before.   Let me explain, feet aren't really my thing. They're pretty nasty, if you ask me. So the idea of spending like 10-15 minutes talking to someone about mine specifically and then watching a SLOW MOTION video of them is just way too much.   But it was pretty awesome. I learned I have really high arches, and too much ankle flexibility and tend to keep my weight all on my heels. Fascinating.   So they mold a pair of insoles specifically for your foot and then recommend a pair of sneaks that compliment your needs as a runner. I ended up with a sweet pair of Nikes. And with the VIP membership, it took about $30 off the total bill.  All of the associates are friendly, knowledgable and down to earth. I never got the 'holier than thou' runners attitude from any of them.   Now I've been running on my new kicks for a few days and I actually do see a big difference in the way I run. And that's the biggest return, actual results.  Happy trails.

My experiences coming here have been nothing short of amazing. Mr. Ariel is such a professional craftsman and his prices and timing are great. I have had two boots completely resoled and one pair of heels retipped. He is swift and friendly and is so perfectly gentlemanly and old school. I recommend all of my friends to come here. You will not be disappointed!

Mmmmmmm butterrrrr.   I'm speaking specifically of the Edamame with truffle butter. We probably could have eaten a few orders of these.   Sugar cane pork. Ohhh yes. Falls of those teeny little bones right into my mouth. Very finger foody. Delicious.   Spicy "Sirring" Shrimp. Comes out sizzling and spicy and delicious. As the server mentioned, "Sirring" isn't a real word, but who cares!  These three were the stars of the five tapas that we chose. I cant really remember the other two, so they clearly weren't that great.   The atmosphere is cute, artsy and pretty comfortable. The music was a little low, so we could hear the conversations of the couples on either side of us pretty easily. Kinda awwwwkwaaaard.   I would for sure return.

I was pretty surprised with how awesome Fear Farm turned out to be. The amount of actors is staggering and the corn mazes were definitely scary.   For $25, you get five different mazes/houses. Each one is a different theme, some indoors, some out, some a mix of the two.   Besides the attractions, there are actors wandering around to take pictures with, carnival food and games.   The parking situation wasn't too bad, but it is a bit of a walk from the lot to the entrance. The exit is right next to the lot.  The only negative is partly our own fault. We went later at night so the actors were starting to get tired and antsy, some of them just weren't taking the whole thing seriously. I would say go right when it gets dark out when they're still "fresh".

What can be better than sitting in an open air bar on a beautiful Spring afternoon, sipping on a freezing cold Moscow Mule while listening to live music?   Answer: not much.  I had a really great time at this bar. It was packed with Spring Training out of towners, locals both young and old and just all around good people. The vibe is super chill and down-to-earth. The bartenders are busy, but friendly.  They always have live music here, but it's never too loud to down out your conversation.   I loved the Moscow Mule and the cool copper mug it comes in ($15 if you don't return it!), but the margarita on the rocks was not too good. Stick to what a dive is good at: beer and the occasional house cocktail.  Will definitely return.

I'm very happy (but my love handles aren't) that I live right up the street from Bagel Nosh.  I stopped in one hungover morning on my way to work for a breakfast Sammie. The girl working the counter and her dad maning the grill were super friendly! I was deciding between the Jalapeno bagel and the Sour dough. She recommended the sour dough and oh man, it was so good. I had it toasted with egg and sausage. Delicious. Next time I'll ask for the egg a little more runny, it was a bit overdone for my taste but it was still good and hot.    Being from New York, I have a hard time finding a good bagel place, and it looks like I might have found it!

Whenever I go out to lunch with my sister and my two small nephews, this is where we end up. Matt (five years old) LOVES the kids turkey sandwich. Pretty funny. He devours the thing, slurps down the gogurt and loves the huge chocolate chip cookie that comes with it.   Chris (three) loves the Mac n cheese, and ya know what? It's actually pretty good. Aunt Andrea usually ends up finishing it for him... Not complaining there.  I usually get a different sandwich each time, but I always get the Greek salad and it's great every time. Very fresh ingredients.   The only thing I don't like about this type of store is how confusing it is. Especially when people are in line behind you, there's so much pressure! There are too many options and it's hard to take it all in. But when I do finally pick something (usually at random just to be done with it), it's always enjoyable.

Absolutely beatiful hiking area. The Gateway Loop in particular is my favorite. It really takes you away from the noise of civilization and back to nature. It's not too strenuous, and definitely dog friendly. On the weekends, it does get very packed with walkers and runners alike, so be aware of your surroundings.   Something very special about the trail head is the educational nature walk they have installed. There are about fifteen stops along the path with information about the plant life, animal life, weather, ecology and human interaction with and of the Sonoran Desert. Im glad I took the time to check it out because I definitely learned a lot about the desert that I hadn't known before.   Highly recommended way to spend a few hours.

How is it possible that 7 people ordered 6 bottles of wine and 6 huge bruschetta boards and their check is only $130??   I have no idea, it must have been a rip in the space/time continuum. That's the most obvious answer to me, anyway.  If you haven't eaten at a Postino's, I mean seriously, what are you waiting for? An invitiation? Well if that's it.. then here. I cordially invite you to dine at Postino's.  The service leaves a little something to be desired- like a server pouring my wine. All they did was open the bottle and then set it back on the table for us to pour out ourselves. We even opened one of the two bottles of Prosecco we ordered. To me, that's absolutely ridiculous. This is a wine bar, if I wanted to serve myself, I would go to Total Wine and take that shiz home with me.   But whatever, it was still a blast and the bruschetta were delicious. I will definitely come back. Many times.

I've been to two different European Wax Centers and always have a great experience. I much prefer this style of waxing over the strips. It's cleaner, less painful and faster. All good things when you're having hair ripped out of your unmentionable areas!   Nadia was wonderful and I of course booked my next appointment with her on my way out the door. I do not find the girls at the desk to be pushy at all. I simply told them I could not afford to prepay for multiple sessions and that was the end of it.   Highly recommended.

Everything looks so pretty and neatly organized that I almost feel bad touching anything. This store reminds me of those chotchke stores that are full to the brim with candles and art work and home decor and floral EVERYWHERE and everything is expensive and you can't tell if it's for sale or if you're even allowed to pick it up, where the woman who owns the place is covered in floral and beads and stuff so she blends in with the walls. Yeah, like that.   The produce is fresh and beautiful and the meat section looks like they just cut it off the animal and the fish just flopped in from the ocean. The wine selection is wide and varied and expensive. There's oils and juices and breads and stuff I can't pronounce and wouldn't know what to do with in the first place.  The only times I ever shop here are when I don't feel like baking and need to bring a pretty dessert to a party, or when I don't feel like making my own hummus. They have a really great selection of hummus and spreads and dips with all sorts of chips and pita to go with it.  EXPENSIVE. I would never shop here on a regular basis. I just don't see my self that way. You know... that North Scottsdale, I drive a Jaguar and my kid goes to Notre Dame Prep while the cleaning lady neatens my mansion off Pima and Happy Valley. Not to judge or anything, those people sure are blessed.

I want to review the food I ate here, but I can't because I didnt actually get to eat.  I had 15 minutes before work to grab something. The line wasn't too long so I didn't think anything of it.  Except there was only one cashier ringing people and taking orders. She chit-chatted with the man in front of me for so long that I ran out of time and had to leave empty handed. I tried to make eye contact with her to let her see my distress but she was too engrossed to notice.  I will not fault her for being polite with a regular guest or whoever he was but this is the morning rush hour. You can't take that much time on each patron when people have such limited time.   Annoying.

Hooray for my 200th Review!  I wanted to make my 200th kind of special so I chose my newest Favorite place.   Don't get me wrong though, I kind of hate this place too.  My reasoning: you work. You work damn hard. And that's the whole point.   Harrison does not go easy on me because I'm a girl and I sometimes whine. He kicks my ass and then I say thank you! Kind of sexy.   Everytime I leave, my arms and legs are shaking, I'm sweating my face off and I'm thinking nasty thoughts about how I'm never coming back, but then I find myself texting him the next day to see when I come back and train.   Each time I come to the gym, I learn something new and I get just a little bit better than the last time. And he's great at mixing up the routine, some days we focus on arms and other days on legs.   Nothing is more satisfying than defying your pain and growing your resistance and willpower. It's hard and it hurts and if you keep doing it, you and you alone get better and better. It's a lifestyle and I'm never giving it up.

I lurv this place. The smoothies, the food, the pastries, the service, the atmosphere all rock. I lurv that they have a punch card for smoothies and coffee so you can get one for free! There's patio seating when it's nice out, tables inside for studying, couches for lounging and a HUGE chess set. Like massive. I will always have fond memories of this chess set, it's where I first learned how to play.   I lurv that you can add supplements to the smoothies- they've got vitamins and caffeine and other neat stuff. So much better than Jamba Juice simply because they're locally owned and operated by some really nice high school kids.   You really get a community vibe in this place, there are posters, cards and pictures on the walls made by local kids. I really dig it.   They're currently waiting for a liquor permit, so I'm excited to see what they do with it!

Ya know, if it weren't 376 degrees outside most of the year, I would like this shopping area even more than I already do. There are plenty of shops and eateries to keep me entertained for a few hours.  Mainly I hit up the same three places, listed thusly in no particular order:  -Apple store to feed the addiction, nom nom apple products nom nom  -H&M... must... buy.. cheaply made... inexpensive... trendy girl ... clothes omglolcat  -Press Coffee Roaster... BECAUSE I'M JUST NOT CAFFEINATED ENOUGH.   Runners up:  -West Elm, to drool and fawn over adorable and ridiculously overpriced home decor.  -True Foods Kitchen, because it's just yummy but I never get there often enough.   -The bathingsuit store, Have no idea what it's called. Cuz who doesn't like exposing their flub to the world in overpriced bathing suits that you cant even get wet, probably.   And so ends my mini-tour of the Scottsdale Quarter. Questions? Good, I didn't think so... let's go get drunk!

Whether you're looking to play by yourself or with someone else, you are definitely going to find something to suit your needs. The toy section in this store is extensive, latex, plastic, glass, leather, beads, pulsing, throbbing... you know, all that fun stuff.  Don't be ashamed if this is your first time in the store, the woman who was working was extremely friendly and knew when to step in and when to walk away.   The other thing I liked about this store is the clean lay out. The store is spacious, neatly organized and free of clutter.   I came in for the apparel and while I saw at least four or five corsets and cinchers that I liked, when I tried them on; none of them fit right. I don't have a super weird body type, so I was surprised when NONE of them fit. Like not even a little bit. Oh well. The other thing that bugged me was the shoe selection. There were some killer heels that  I would absolutely want to buy- but I felt they were way overpriced. Like I've said before, that just might be my broke-ass opinion.  Don't forget to check in, they had a 20% off Check In offer when I stopped by!

This is not an easy hike. But it's an awesome hike, for sure. If you aren't an avid hiker, my main piece of advice is to STRETCH YOUR CALVES before you start. Seriously. You'll thank me when you don't have debilitating cramps. And bring water, you're going to be huffing and puffing.   I entered at the new trail head from the north. There is quite a large parking lot, a small educational area, clean bathrooms and NO RUNNING WATER. This is important to take note of if you plan on filling your water bottles at the gate.   There are many steep switchbacks and several beautiful scenic spots. If you're into rock climbing, there are a handful of locations here for bouldering.   Getting to the Thumb feels great emotionally, but for me, it was a bit anticlimactic. There is a better scenic spot about .5 of a mile prior to reaching it where you have a beautiful panorama of the McDowells.   High heeled shoes may give you great calves, but Toms Thumb will give you a great butt!

I absolutely love this museum.   To put it simply, the curators did an amazing job. The museum is well organized, neat, high-tech,  fun and constantly engaging. As a musician, I found it particularly interesting, but even for the everyday music lover, there's a display for everyone to enjoy.   We thought two hours would be enough, but it wasn't even close! Sure you can whizz through, but my buddy and I watched, listened to and read every single display. We only got through maybe 1/3 of the whole museum! We are definitely going back to finish it all.  As a strange and frustrating side note, I thought it was interesting that they displayed a violin made in Germany on the Israel wall. They couldn't find an Israeli made violin? I find that hard to believe.

"Why is everything I touch sticky?"  That pretty much sums things up for Saddle Ranch. We sat at the bar for a quick drink before heading in to Jobbing.com Arena. We were robbed, sweated a bit in the lack of air condition, and got sticky in the process.   Also, what's the deal with the plastic cups that are supposed to look like glass? They just look scratched up and dingey. Nasty.  For $25 all we got was 1 beer, 1 mixed drink and 2 sad shots. Waste of money. Go  to the Yard House for better beer and atmosphere.

I love the food here. Like... Way too much. I work down the street and even if I bring lunch with me, I will drive down and order some hummus and chicken anyway. Sack lunch be damned!  The chicken in every dish is juicy and so fricken flavorful. The veggies are really fresh. The pita is soft and warm. The hummus (three kinds!) is creamy and delicious. The staff are friendly. So many excellent things.

Hellooooooo...... :echo... echo...:  Myself and three other customers were waiting in line for about ten minutes with no one behind the counter.   Not a sign, not a shout from someone in the back. Just a counter and delicious donuts mocking me... Just out of reach.   What a frustrating experience. I even left, went next door and came back to see that people were STILL waiting for assistance.   I eventually gave up. No donut for me.

I have never been impressed with the clothes and shoes they sell in this store. Everything is outdated and looks very worn and faded. It's like shopping at a garage sale, but way more expensive. I did find one dress a few months back, but after wearing it once, the seam fell out.   I brought in a bag of clothes to sell to them and they rejected all but one of my items and said that they were out of season. Seriously? Everything in this store is out of season!  By years! I haven't seen clothing like this since the early episodes of Friends. I mean, come on.   No thank you.

Yum. Seriously yum.   I still kind of feel guilty about this massive breakfast I ate, but... I'll get over it.   The pancakes are the star. As many people have pointed out. They're fluffy and have great flavor, and they're dripping with butter. Heaven.   I had a plate with two pancakes, two sausage patties, two strips of thick and delicious bacon and two eggs over easy. Ridiculous.   Joe himself even came around to see how things were.   One star off for the kind of runny, undercooked eggs. Here's a solution to that problem, skip the stupid eggs next time and stick to what's good... Pancakes.

So it's the post office, a service we all need at one point or another. You'll most likely have to wait in line, pay more than you want, and have your boxes get busted in transit. This is the reality. Deal with it.  The gentleman who assisted me was very friendly! Take that, bah-humbugs!

Excellent coffee. Very rich, deep flavor. I dig the atmosphere of this place. Ya know, the whole 'house turned coffee shop' vibe. There are tables outside on the front lawn and patio, tables scattered throughout the house and a bar in the front room. It gives the place a very comforting mood. Like going over a kooky Aunt's house.  The only thing I was sketched out by was, if you look into the back room next to the bar there's a shelf covered with electrical chords plugged in and going every which way. It looks absolutely crazy, like an electrical fire waiting to happen. Makes me wonder what other crazy shit is going on back there.   Other than the imminent death, the coffee was great and the scone I had was tasty. I'd definitely return.

Yes. Yes, yes, yes.   So fresh and flavorful and delicious and modern and healthy (mostly) and varied and spicy, sweet, crunchy... Seriously. So good.   We sat at the bar. Always sit at the bar.   It's not on the menu, but one of the bartenders (I wish I remembered his name!) makes a damn good spicy Bloody Mary. And it's not Sunday Brunch without a Bloody Mary.   I had the Spicy Shrimp noodle something or other. It was awesome. The broth was spicy, there were a lot of shrimp and vegetables and the noodles were the perfect texture.   I had the hardest time picking what I wanted because everything on the menu sounds and looks awesome. I can't wait to go back!

My buddy and I had brunch here before our day at the MIM and wow, what a great experience!  We are totally "those" people, he's a vegetarian and I'm dairy free. I know, I know, annoying. Tryst totally doesn't mind! Their menu caters to all types of tastes and requirements. They proudly serve a creative and organic menu.  We each had a spicy Bloody Mary. Fricken delicious, they're made with cucumber vodka and all sorts of veggies: olives, pickled green beans, celery, cherry tomato. The works. Totally hit the spot.  I had the Huevos Rancheros. Anytime I see this offered in a menu, I get it, so I'm kind of an expert. I wasn't overly impressed, but it was all right. There were way too many tortilla strips, which made the dish hard to manage. It was more like a "build your own" since all the ingredients were separated on the plate. Good flavor though.  The service was great as well, you could tell the girl was knowledgable and fun. The manager (or owner?) also stopped by to check on us and was super friendly.  It's really nice to have a small mom and pop type eatery in the land of chain restaurants and shops.   Highly recommended!

Searching through the racks of clothes in this store is like searching the heavens for the face of God. You look and look and pray and get down on your knees and dig through the meaning of it all and you come up with something that looks just about right but when you put it on, you realize it doesn't fit. So you keep searching. You might find something, you might not. But always the search continues. And there are always people in your way. And never a room to enter to try on your new found God.   Did this analogy work at all?

Very solid red eye. Coffee plus espresso plus soy milk. The espresso gives the coffee that lovely crema on top and the soy milk rounds out and softens the flavor. I thoroughly enjoyed sitting out on the sidewalk sipping my coffee and chatting.   I think I'll have to stop here whenever I come to the Quarter to shop.

Narcisse is the perfect spot for a bit of bubbly on a lazy Sunday afternoon, or a sexy Friday night out on the town, or Tuesday lunch, or Wednesday dinner. Wait.. Bubbly is good anytime. Well whatever,  The atmosphere morphs very easily from day to night because of the ambience of the space. The space is very white and airy, with lots of tables, comfy chairs and couches everywhere. They gave us the pick of the room and didn't try to rush us out even though they were closing down to reset for dinner service in 45 minutes.   The food and cocktail menu looks great and I thoroughly enjoyed my freezing cold glass of Schramsberg Blanc de Blanc at a very reasonable $9 a glass.   Would definitely return.

I'm pretty easy when it comes to my yogurt needs. Give me a cup of the "original" flavor with some sliced almonds and a bit of dark chocolate chips and I'm good to go. I don't need none of that crazy Cheesecake flavor or boba or pound cake mix-ins. There's just something very satisfying about the tangy original flavor with the crunch of almond and the sweet and bitter dark chocolate. Fricken yum.  Unfortunately, yogurtology didn't have any almond slices, so I went with mini dark chocolate chips and coconut. Which is not a bad combo, if I do say so myself!   Note: you're supposed to ask an associate for any samples, which I did not realize at the time because I don't read signs and there wasn't an associate around at the time anyway. Whoops.

No. I don't think so.  I'm in the service industry. I get out of work and want to have a drink. This means I'm going to be arriving at your bar later in the evening.   We walked in at around 11. We ordered two glasses of wine, paid for them and plopped down on a couch to relax. At exactly 12 on the dot, they turned off the music and turned up the lights. One manager came over to ask if we were finished. I looked at my 1/4 filled glass and said No.  Another bartender comes over and asks if we were finished. Still no. But he chose to stand there and watch us while we finished the last few sips.  Aside from the weird ambiance (is it a lounge? A bar? A sports bar?) the way were treated was beyond rude and unacceptable.   I will never return and I will tell everyone I know not to come here. You do not treat people (especially ones who work in the same industry) this way and not expect a backlash.

The girl who helped us is an evil, seductive temptress with her ice cream scoop. Here's the deal, I'm wicked lactose intolerant, I had just eaten a bunch of Mac and cheese and was already seriously regretting my life decisions. So of course, instead of just calling it a day, I suggest wandering over to Churn. Ya know, I hadn't been there before and I only want to LOOK. What's the harm in browsing?  And then this girl, this adorably sweet and friendly girl behind the ice cream counter is all "oh, just try them! Here.. Have a sample of every flavor we have". So I do, I try them all. And then I order a brownie, and then shes all sweetly saying "why don't I top this off with a scoop of vanilla? And whipped cream with chocolate sauce? You cant just have a plain brownie.. That's just not right." And I'm like putty in her hands. I nod my head weakly in agreement, mumbling something like "no you can't have a plain brownie."  And then I buy a bag of mini gummy bears, because, well because they're there.

Wow. The Jersey Shore meets the Real Housewives of Scottsdale.   This was our second stop of the night, and maybe because the first stop was so cool it made Copper Blues all the more lame.  I'm looking around and I'm seeing popped collars, gelled hair, really dark eyeliner, Ed Hardy and Uggs with leggings. Seriously? People still dress this way?  I will say, they have an amazing selection of beers on tap; about 60, plus a large selection of bottles as well.  The reason we came here in the first place was for the live music. Above the bar is a stage for a band but unfortunately, there was a "DJ" last night. This guy sure was moving around a lot like he was doin stuff and having a grand ole time, but I have no idea what he was actually mixing. He just played Top 40 songs from start to finish. So. Lame.   Picture this if you will. 40something MILF wearing a mini dress with a slit down the back and thigh high stockings grinding on your dad. They were basically dry humping one another in the middle of the bar. If you're that old, can't you just go home and bone? I don't get it.  This is definitely not my scene and I will never return.

I have a confession to make.   I am... A hipster. It's happened. And ya know what? I'm okay with it.   We came here last night in search of PBRs and live music. We got that. And so much more. As we're standing there sipping our Champagne of Beers and someone says:  "Damn, that's a really good Jimmy Eat World cover band playing."  And then someone else says:  "Wait a second! That IS Jimmy Eat World!"  So awesome. So 2001.  The atmosphere of this place is great. You have a big outdoor area with space heaters for the cancer lovers, a nice sized front area for the boozers with high top tables and low tables, also plenty of room to stand and chill. The music venue is spacious and well amped.   Apparently the food is great, I would definitely give it a try next time.  One star off for the minimal bathrooms. There was always a huge line.

I love this place. I love the concept, the food, the coffee, the atmosphere, the location. It all just works.   You go up the the counter at the back, you order and pay for your food, they give you a card, the food gets delivered to you, you eat and you leave. There's a person who even cleans up your mess. It's simple, it's easy, it's fast and the food is just as good if not better than other sit down restaurants.  I always get the chorizo scramble thing with eggs and potatos and tortilla on the side. It's ridiculously good. It's great hang over food. They have other healthy stuff too. And booze! They've got mimosas and bloody marys. It's great.

I am beyond thrilled with my haircut! Zach did an awesome job.   We cut off something like six or seven inches and drastically changed the color. He was encouraging and supportive and excited about all our choices. His coach was always nearby if Zach had a question. I never felt nervous about having a student cut and color my hair.   His attention to detail and conversation was perfect. Everyone I've seen since has absolutely loved my hair.   By the end of the cut, two students stood by watching to see the final product and they were really impressed with his work.  Highly recommended.

Dog friendly patio!   Dude, seriously brah, I love taking my dog Riley here to chill on the patio with a beer and a burger. The beer list is extensive with local beers and imports. The burger list is huge! So many choices, or a build your own option. They're served with your choice of tots, sweet potato tots or fries.   I've eaten here twice and both times were great. The patio is a little on the small side, so I try to come during an off time so my dog isn't bothering anyone, she's just way too friendly and nosey. She'd be all up in some lady's tots like "gimme one of your tots!".   If you arent a burger person, although why wouldn't you be?!, they have chicken sandwiches, salads and wings too.   Check it out, and look for me and Riley on the patio!

This is such a hip place. Mainly because they're dog friendly and serve really delicious beer and food. There's isn't really much else needed, but they've also got a great patio, bar and dining room. Parking kind of sucks, but I guess no one is perfect. One star off because they had a couple of beers listed on the menu that they were waiting to tap, which was pretty irritating, since most of the people at our table wanted them.   They make dog biscuits for you to take for free!

The Things that Work. Really well:  -the burgers. Seriously delicious, imaginative and well constructed burgers. Every time. -the beer. Options! And real knowledge from the bartender! Like 10-15 on draft and a handful by the bottle. -the liquor. Again, options! And fun specialty cocktails. And bartenders who know how to construct shots with more imagination than pouring cold jäger in a shot glass. -the desserts. The brownie and ice cream is so good that I'm willing to throw my calorie counter out the window and devour the thing by myself, while growling at those trying to share with me. NO SHARING! -the TVs. Lots of them! Playing all different sports! And different teams! Not just the same game on every tv. They switch on music videos after the games are over, later in the evening. I become completely mesmerized by this and will lose at pool because of it. -the billiards: ---On Monday nights, it's $9 unlimited all night play. Other nights is $7/hour. You can see the value there.  ---the tables are beautifully maintained. ---the cues are straight and true. All in excellent condition. ---the pool tables are appropriately spaced from the walls and tables. You never have to worry about twisting yourself in some weird shape because you're too damn close to the wall to make your shot.  -the bartenders. They care abut you and your beers. They will come out to you while you're playing pool to see if you need a fresh drink.   The Things that Don't Work:  -I live too far away and can't come here often enough.

I'm not impressed. The gas is expensive, the food inside is expensive and not fresh. The employees are very friendly but that doesn't make up for it.   I've stopped in a few times to pick up some veggies/ fruit as a snack at work and they have never been fresh or even ripe. I have been disappointed each time.    The first time I stopped in, I bought a container of sliced cucumber. Later at work I ate one and it was so sour and clearly had gone bad. I tried to call them to let them know to remove the product from the shelf and could not for the life of me find the phone number. It is not listed ANYWHERE.   When I went in to return the product they were very appologetic and sincere but at this point I doubt I'll come in again.  Maybe they just need time to settle in, so I might come back in a few months.

This is a review for the Banfield Pet Hospital.  Riley (the famous ROTD dog) and I came here for her rabies vaccination and had a very easy and pleasant experience. We made an appointment since they're pretty busy and were shown in only a few moments after the scheduled time.   Checking in was very easy considering how all of the staff are extremely friendly and kind and most importantly- patient.   Let me tell you, dogs do not like it when you put things up their butt. The nurse who took Riley's temperature was extremely kind with her and the ordeal went very smoothly.   Just two or three minutes later, the doctor came in to administer the shot. She spoke sweetly and calmly to Riley to ease her discomfort and really took her time to make sure she was ready and prepared for the shot.  Afterwards she was thorough in explaining what to watch for in case there was a negative reaction.   Checking out was simple and they made copies of everything I needed.  "wooffff growf howwwlll bark" Riley says she highly recommends this location for all your pet doctoring needs!

Very friendly owner, fresh ingredients and customizable menu.  It's great to have a salad place so close to the gym!

The staff here are friendly and readily available, they'll even stop what they're in the middle of doing to assist you. The selection is wide and varied. Youll find all the popular brands you're used it. A lot of items on discount.  The thing that really pisses me off is how expensive the clothes are. Even with a discount you can spend up to $40 on a sports bra. That's just crazy to me. If you're savvy you can get out of that store in under $100, but it's tough. I spent almost $20 on one pair of socks!

The drink I had was named The Darkness, in it was some kind of lavender infused something or other, egg white and about six other ingredients of unknown name and origin. And the bartender who suggested it was neither pompous nor pretentious.   This is the type of bar I would go to in New York City on a daily basis, but not tell anyone about because it's that good. I don't really want anyone to actually come here,  thus making it too busy to enjoy.   The drink menu is extensive and changes seasonally. Almost every cocktail is $10, which is insanely inexpensive considering the craft and talent and quality they are made with.   They also offer food late night, I think the comestibles are available until 1am?   The decor of this place is so perfect it's ridiculous. It plays off Hotel Palomar perfectly with a little bit of a ranch style with mod touches and who knows what else. It's impossible to describe and impossible not to fall in love with.   Why am I not here right now?

Thank you Yelp for providing me the opportunity to learn about a wonderful local business!   The General Manager, Brandon, told me all about how Mood Swings Salon is dedicated to giving back to the community as much as possible. They donate their time, money, services and wall space to local artists and the community at large. I never would have known!  We were able to get make-overs, massages with Aveda Chakra aromatherapy, sample facial products and get our nails done! So much generosity! AND we left with a goodie bag with samples and coupons for services.   While we were there, the salon was fully operational and I was observing the stylists while they worked. They all have a unique style with clothes and tattoos and when their clients were having their hair washed, they received massages and warm towels on their face. Such service!  I can't wait to go back and try out this salon. Thank you Lindsey for introducing me to Mood Swings!   And sorry for exploding that bottle of champagne everywhere!!!

Vovomeena means Grandma Meena. And if this is how Grandma Meena always cooks, then I would kindly ask to be adopted, immediately.   We came here for brunch to take advantage of the beautiful patio weather. I had two eggs over easy, taters, buttermilk biscuit and sausage. He had .. get this... Banana bread pudding french toast with some kind of whiskey sauce?! Decadence to the extreme. The French toast was delicious, but you need to have a serious sweet tooth to be able to put the whole thing down.   Everything we ate had delicious flavor and looked great too, good portion size and all.   The style of service is very simple, you order and pay at the counter, they give you a numbered card and bring your food to wherever you choose to sit.   There is also a coffee bar where they have Japanese Cold Drip coffee! Exactly what we need in the sweltering Arizona summer.  Keep in mind that they close at 1:30.

I want that mural in my house.   Everyone mentions the Spam Sliders, and for good reason too: they're awesome. If you have any hesitancy about Spam, just knock it off! They were so good. Spam sorta tastes like a hotdog, with a different sort of consistency. Topped with feta slaw on a toasted mini bun, they're damn tasty.   You've also got an excellent beer selection. It's chalked up on a huge board by number, with a description and ABV and Price. As the tap runs dry, they erase it and put in a new one. The rotation is ever changing. The servers are also really knowledgable about all of the beers and can give you a taste if you're unsure about a selection. You can also do a flight of six if you're looking for a varied selection of beers. No liquor, but they do have some wines.  The atmosphere is lively and loud and the clientelle is all over the board. If you're a smoker, you've got an outdoor patio with heaters.   This is also a great place for a date. The loud atmosphere makes it a fun place to talk and not feel like you have to whisper or feel awkward if there is a pause in the conversation.   I would absolutely come back!

These Charming Charlie stores are overwhelming with a capital O. The amount of rings, necklaces, purses, earrings, bling, glitz, sparkle, estrogen and pleather is off the charts. Thank the Gods of accesorizing that they organize everything by color because, holy crap. I wouldn't be able to handle it if everything were jumbled together like a flea market. My head would pop off in a spray of sequins and fake gold links.   I walk up to the cashier with my one little $6 fake gold ring and feel pretty damn proud of myself when she says "that's it?" with a smile on her face.   I'm all... "hell yeah that's it! I almost lost my mind in this place. I'm proud of my one, tiny, insignificant ring. Bish."  The ladies working here are comically nice. They're all, "can I help you find anything?" and I'm all, "um... No. Unless you found my OCD cowering somewhere on a shelf with the purses and sandals... I'm good."

Gigi's is my 'go-to' for Birthday or celebration cupcakes. I haven't actually eaten one myself, but everyone I have gifted them upon has raved about them! I buy them one at a time, so the price doesn't bother me too much, but buying a full box would be way out of my price range.  There are traditional flavors, but also fun things that rotate like Bourbon Pecan and Red Velvet, etc. Also gluten free options in the right hand case.   The girls working here are sugary sweet and very nice. They will try to sell you on their free membership for discounts and check in offers.   Enjoy!

A whole wheat mini #7, please. Hold the cheese. With spicy mustard, lettuce, tomato and jalapeño. That's about 410 calories and makes me oh, so happy after a workout at the gym.   I love that they slice your meat for you when you order it and all of the toppings are really fresh. I also like that it's a pretty simple set up. There's something like 15 sandwich options, with some hot, some wrapped and others on subs. You can also have a sandwich in a dish if you're gluten free.   I'm a big fan. I also like the rewards program. You get points for every sandwich you purchase and eventually they earn you a free sammich! Heck yeah!

I loooove the Cajun Style Salmon. Seriously, it's so delicious. It's probably got enough sodium to float a person in a pool for a couple days, but whatever. Who doesn't love salt?  This is the place to come for good wings and good beer and 34 televisions to watch the game. I was here for the BCS game and so was everyone else in a 10 mile radius. It was fun! Rowdy, but everyone was very cool and no jerks to be heard.   As soon as the game ends, the place empties out pretty quick, but it's never dead. Being right across the plaza from the movie theatre makes it the perfect place to grab a drink and bite to eat before or after your flick.   I'm a big fan!

Absolutely beautiful atmosphere. Everything is silver and gold and subtle with beautiful chandeliers everywhere. But not glitzy, the designer has a great eye, that's for sure. This is a great date spot. The booths are large and the tables aren't too close to one another. The bar is a good size and separated from the dining room.   The food was delicious. We came in for their restaurant week menu and it was lovely. What I don't really understand is the direction of the menu. It's part Mediterranean, part Italian. But which is it? I had a house salad, a salmon with rice and vegetables and while everything was cooked perfectly, it was neither Italian *or* Mediterranean! Oh well.   I would come back, but I'm not running.

The food here is super fresh and delicious! They let you try all of the meats before you pick your meal. Everything is made to order like at Chipotle but with way more flavor and variety.   When we arrived we were STARVING, like DYING of starvation. No exaggeration. And of course we just happened to walk in after a group of like 9 people and they totally clogged up the works. After us was like four or five people so they became very quickly overwhelmed by the sudden rush of people. When we went to eat our food in the dining area, almost every table was covered with dirty dishes. I guess the people who had come in to eat didn't understand you're supposed to clear off your stuff.   Other than the service hiccup, I would definitely come back to eat here. The prices are great too!

Have you ever had Boba Tea before? Yeah, me neither. But I've heard from my Asian friends in NY that it's super popular in Japan. And with beverage sizes like *hug*, how can you not?   So we got a boba tea, it was tropical fruit flavored with "peach nunus" on the bottom. You watch them make it and it gets sealed in this fancy machine and then they hand you a GIGANTIC straw. It's weird.   It was... very different. The peach nunus on the bottom definitely taste like peach, but the texture is just strange. They don't melt in your mouth, they don't pop and they don't ooze.. they just.. are. Like a gummy candy I guess.   Overall, it was tasty, but probably a million grams of sugar.

Dr. Battaglia is the best! He's very gentle and understanding and explains everything he needs to do.   I'm a huge Nervous Nelly at the dentist, it all started when I was little with a mean old crotchety dentist yelling at me to settle down when he had to pull out a broken tooth. That scarred me for life. Luckily though, Dr. Battaglia is young and friendly and really sympathetic. He's swift and thorough.   They take most major insurance companies AND they accept the Care Credit program.

I don't know what everyone's deal is but I have never had an issue with the staff, either here or at their old location. Most people seem to complain about attitude and demeaning nature but the staff have always been friendly to me. Maybe you get what you give?  Anyway. This store is great, a TON of clothes to sift through,  which I really enjoy. I love the thrill of the hunt for cool clothes.    It's organized by item and then by color so it's pretty easy to narrow down what you have in mind.   One star off because sometimes the items are a little beat and overpriced. But that's not that norm.  I'll keep coming back for sure!

No but seriously, I love this place.  $3 House Margaritas.  Queso Dip with chips.  These are really the only two things I need to be happy.   But if I'm feeling like cheese and tequila aren't enough for a full meal (wait, it isn't?) they also have amazing tacos, brunch, appetizers, beer, mixed drinks and whatever else their awesome chefs and bartenders come up with. The cool thing is they are constantly reinventing the menu and trying out new things.   Want live music on the weekend while sitting on a shaded patio? Yeah, they've got that.  Want cool a cool space to chill during First Friday? They've got that too.  Highly, highly recommended.

I don't get it. It's a lame hotdog in a soggy bun with annoying seeds. It also had neon green relish that had next to no flavor. I ate it because I was hungry and on the way to the bar. But otherwise I would never come back. We also ordered fries which look like the frozen Oreida kind you get in the super market and make at home. They even have the nerve to charge you for ranch dressing for the french fries! Nuts!   Not returning.
