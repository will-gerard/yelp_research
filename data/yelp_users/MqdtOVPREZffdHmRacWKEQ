Let's pretend for a moment that we're bigshots! We want huge steaks, giant glasses of wine, and beautiful waitresses serving us. It's Friday night and we're getting drunk. That's the feeling at Bandera. Excess is normal and we love it!  Bandera intends to be a serious steakhouse, but they only have three steaks on the menu. That's pretty good compared to the rest of Arizona though. I ordered the fillet mignon with spiced curry powder. Perfectly cooked to my liking (medium rare), the curry powder was balanced, providing a nice zip that vanished as soon as it was detected. The grill masters really know their stuff, as the wood fire grill provides a beautiful aromatic char.  My entree came with a gargantuan piece of broccoli, fitting the theme of excess, as well as an accompaniment of shoestring fries. The fries were thin, crispy, and dainty, being the only reminder to an outside world where things aren't always super-sized. It was a great balance to everything else that evening.   Service is gorgeous and polite. At the bar, the wait staff is a bit hectic as they need to handle two types of requests at the same time. But it's forgivable and the food more than makes up for it.  Highly recommended if you're a voracious carnivore.

"The freshest oysters in all of Arizona" may sound like an oxymoron, but it's what Bluewater Grill boasts. They proudly showcase two types of oysters a day, one west coast and one east coast. That may not seem like a lot but hey, we're in the middle of the desert -- what do you expect?  East coast oysters are brinier and saltier. They sometimes have a funk that comes from the merroir (like terroir but for the sea). West coast oysters are sweeter and have more fruit flavors like cucumber or melon. Pick your style or try them all!  Happy hour prices are pretty good. On weekdays they're 3:30 - 6:30 and you get discounts on some food and drinks (including oysters!).  I also tried the King crab, which was delicious but very expensive. If you are sociable and make friends with the bartenders, they may be able to cut you a deal (half order of king crab, for instance).

This place is gigantic! They have a million bottles of whatever you want, and at bargain prices. The staff is knowledgeable about spirits and wine and their passion shows. A bottle of Laphroaig 18 that normally retails for $100 in NYC sells for $75 here. I am buying a few bottles to take home at that rate.

Not as good as its Tempe counterpart, but equally as creative. The menu omits a few things that the Tempe CDO establishment proudly showcases. However, it has the mainstays from the menu, such as steak with gorgonzola sauce, fried chicken, and 36 hour ribs.   The space is airy, spacious, and perfect for relaxing with a beer or glass or wine while watching Sunday football. Come here with some buddies and split a charcuterie plate. During brunch, it's not on the normal menu though (strange).

It just goes to show that you don't need a formal culinary education to cook beautifully. Culinary Dropout hits all the right notes with its delicious food. Take great ingredients, interesting compositions, and beautiful presentation and you have CDO.   The place can be quite boisterous as it gets later on in the day. Sit at the bar if you're dining alone and have a few beers or some wine. There's local Arizona beer as well as canned beers in paper bags.   Don't miss the charcuterie. It's only $5 for a healthy one-ounce serving of any of these meats. It's sliced paper thin, almost transparent, leaving the flavor no space to hide. Prosciutto is classic. A supplement of $8 is what it'll cost you for the Jamon Iberico, a truly special kind of meat that comes from special, acorn-fed Spanish black Iberian hogs that will leave you hungry for more. Rarely do I see it offered at restaurants but when I do, I always order it. You should too, as their slicing technique is perfect and the meat is perfectly salty and flavorful.  I also ordered the special (very limited) Korean style ribeye-cap. Ribeye cap is the fattier end piece of ribeye that is normally discarded after grilling or broiling a whole ribeye steak, but the kitchen does wonders with it, recognizing with a keen eye that we should not treat it as a second-class cut of meat. Instead, they marinate it in soy, ginger, garlic, spicy Korean paste (gochujang), and other aromatics, grill it until nicely charred on the outside and medium rare on the inside, and serve it dressed with sliced zucchini, bean sprouts, beech mushrooms, onions, cilantro, raw garlic, and more of the soy dressing. The raw garlic is amazing, providing a zip and delivering a respectful nod towards authentic Korean BBQ.  "Yesterday's soup" also caught my eye -- the name on the menu is meant to do that. The name will definitely solicit questions; maybe they should change it. But I enjoyed a bowl of chicken noodle, rich with flavor, as if my grandmother had been simmering a pot of chicken bones for hours. My only complaint is that the white meat in the soup was dry and flavorless. In the future, maybe the kitchen will learn that tender chicken meat in soup is welcome (either dark meat or white meat that's just perfectly cooked).  In any case, the service is wonderful, the space is lively and noisy, and the food is amazing. I'm looking forward to visiting again and seeing what a culinary dropout can do.

This friendly and very gay restaurant tries hard, but the quality of their food doesn't match the niceness of the staff. I never felt uncomfortable, unwelcome, or idiotic at the restaurant until the food arrived ... then I thought, "Why the hell did I order this?"  A "Grill Platter" was edible -- but only the protein portion. The vegetables were soggy, disgusting, and forgotten extras of a play. The main star, the salmon, was tender, but a little small.  A salad of Strawberries, Blueberry, and Cashews was not mind-blowing, but a salad is a salad.
