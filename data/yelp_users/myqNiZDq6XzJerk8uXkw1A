I have to say, since I wrote my last review in late 2011, Cyprus Grill has made significant improvements to their service and consistency. We stopped in the other day for lunch on the way to do some shopping, and it was busy, but not crazy. It was too chilly to sit on the patio, but we found a seat with plenty of natural light. Our server was extremely polite and cheerful; she didn't hover, nor was she difficult to find when we needed her. The atmosphere was simple and relaxed, and they had a few TVs on (muted).   We split an appetizer of Greek fries - which are a MUST order, and an excellent hangover delicacy - and since we weren't heading straight home, we also asked if we could split a chicken souvlaki dinner. The waitress didn't miss a beat, and the entree - Greek salad with lots of delightful feta, dirty rice with herbs and carrots, tzatziki, and a single kabob each - came out neatly plated separately. We asked her to hold the pita because my hubby is on a strict GF diet.  I was pleasantly surprised to see no split plate charge when I got the bill, so I tipped them a couple of extra bucks. Before tip, two soft drinks, Greek fries, and entree came to $23. Not bad - but if the Middle Eastern Bakery is open down the street, that'll still be my #1.

I love Ted's! Just ask for your dog extra done if you like it charred and charcoal-y like I do. I love their hot relish, and if you ask for "everything," you'll get everything BUT ketchup: just the way it should be.  Their chili is delicious! Tip: if you ask for the chili or cheese on the side, you get more for the same price. They do offer Udi's gluten-free buns now, which is awesome, but I've gotten in the habit of just asking for no bun and using a knife and fork...basically, you can't go wrong eating a Ted's dog.

I am so happy I found this gem! Bill & Gwen put my poor Tercel back together after Brake Masters demolished her brakes and failed to catch a bad axle. This shop is honest and old-school genuine with reasonable pricing. Ask if you can get a tour of the restored cars in the back ;)

My husband had a prior decent experience with this location, so I had him bring my car in last Friday to get my brakes serviced. I knew they needed some serious work, but had no idea what I was in store for.  After ordering not one, but two incorrect parts and spending an entire day with my car, I'm not quite sure what they did under there. I got in my car the following morning and was horrified to find that my brakes were actually worse than they had been previously. Also, my emergency brake was completely loose and I had to fully extend it to park comfortably - and even then, the brakes creaked ominously. When I began driving, I noticed a clacking noise on my passenger side. This is one of the few times in my life that I've actually been scared to drive my own car.  Desperate for some real expertise, I contacted some friends and received a referral to a locally-operated, family-owned business that has been in the same location for 50 years. They got right to work and after lecturing me about the hazards of going to chain brake shops (no kidding), they told me that not only was what was described on my Brake Masters receipt incorrect, but they'd done a bang-up job while they were in there - literally. This mechanic guessed that the Brake Masters techs had been unable to re-attach one of the bearings properly, so instead of taking the thing apart to check for an issue, they actually bent a backing plate so it was scraping on he drum -THAT was that clicking noise I'd been hearing. To make matters worse, the front axle needed replacing, something the Brake Masters techs would have (hopefully!) noticed had they bothered to complete the service to the front of my car.  After the local mechanic called Brake Masters and tried to ask what they'd actually done to my car, I finally got a few calls from the area manager, Adrian. He was a nice enough person, but it became clear fairly quickly that the techs at this location were flat-out providing him with false information. They informed him that my husband had declined service to the front brakes. As I told the area manager, that makes NO sense. Why would I request a half-done job? The manager then obtained my actual paperwork from the store, and realized what the tech at this store had told him was incorrect (as I had told him).   His only solution was to ask me to bring my car back over to the store to let them take a look at it. I let him know that I would, under no circumstances, let his techs touch my car again. He offered a $50 store credit, which was insulting considering the original bill. Finally, after speaking with the owner, he was prepared to offer to charge me half of what the independent store was charging. So essentially, they wanted me to pay them again to fix what they 1) didn't fix in the first place, and 2) might have actually made worse.   I learned my lesson the hard way and will be filing a complaint with the BBB tonight. Ask around and find a reputable shop, because there's no concern for quality here.

I stopped in with a friend on a Saturday night after a friend had recommended it to me and was totally thrilled we did. We sat at a table for sushi and waited no longer than 10 minutes for a table - amazing for 8 pm on a Saturday in old towne.  Unfortunately, they had sold out of the oysters, but the other dishes we'd ordered were fabulous - starting with a seared tuna dish, then softshell crab roll, rainbow roll, and the green mussels. The seared tuna was cooked and cut perfectly - just the right temperature with a peppery "rub," the rolls were a decent size with thick cuts of fish and plenty of flavorful crab, and the mussels were a tad overcooked for my preference but the creamy texture and buttery flavor still made it a winner.   The thing I appreciated most was actually the service - we weren't rushed or hassled, and the food came out a dish at a time, giving us a chance to eat and enjoy before getting our next dish. At other sushi joints, I am constantly feeling rushed while trying to fit all of the dishes on the table (and I'm not what you'd call a slow eater!). This was a happy medium for me. The server confirmed that we were ready for the bill instead of just dropping it off without asking - it's the little details that make a big difference to me.  My only other con was creepy old men leering at us from the bar...but that's what you get in Scottsdale.

Legit yummy! A friend and I met up for early lunch last Saturday and we loved the character and charm of the remade house, complete with potted plants and picket fence. As Yelpers suggested, I parked at the thrift store parking lot just north of the restaurant, but there's also street parking available on 57th Ave.  We showed up close to open because we were both starving and hate crowds. The inside was small, but I loved the nice touches like flowers on the table along with a full assortment of condiments, curtains on the windows, and fairly intimate setting.   I wasn't sure what to expect in terms of service after reading the below reviews, but it started off great - the waiter was friendly and offered to answer any questions we had. I had a Vietnamese coffee and my friend ordered a plain boba tea. Her tea was great, and my coffee was good, but not awesome. I enjoy watching the coffee sit and drip into the condensed milk myself and savoring that rich aroma, but here, they prepped the coffee in the back and just brought me the finished glass. It could have been a bit creamier, but it wasn't too sweet, and the coffee was delightfully strong.   We started with the shrimp and pork spring rolls (#2), which were a bit bigger (longer) than the ones I'd had in other restaurants, so they were sliced in half - $4 was fair for two of these bad boys. They were absolutely scrumptious and very fresh, but packed a little loosely, so the goodies kept falling out as I was trying to dip the roll. I'd recommend grabbing your spoon and scooping the peanut sauce as you need it. Also, try it with the red chile sauce on the table...yum.   We both had our hearts set on pho and ordered two bowls of sliced beef & shrimp pho, #12. The server remarked that it was his favorite menu item, so we were excited. The plate of goodies on the side did not disappoint, but we could have used some extra cilantro and basil. The flavor was just salty enough, the shrimp were more generously sized that I expected, and the beef was tender and not fatty or oily. I've noticed that some Vietnamese restaurants tend to add oil to their pho, and thankfully, Little Saigon did not. The bowl wasn't very greasy at all.  When we had gorged ourselves on delicious pho, we hung out for a few minutes and caught up. This is when I could see what other Yelpers had experienced in terms of service - as soon as the restaurant started to fill up, the servers became stressed and harried, checking tables with visible impatience. That's a bit ridiculous when you're making your way through a giant bowl of pho. I always tip extra if I stay a little longer, so I wasn't about to guilt myself into leaving. When we left a few minutes later, there was a grand total of two people waiting out in the foyer.   I also noticed that Little Saigon has a sizeable patio area out front with lots of potential, but a sign read "patio closed." If seating's an issue, guys, open up the patio. Shame too, it was a beautiful day. Unfortunately, indoors got a bit stuffy and warm, especially near our window seat. I even checked to see whether the window would open...lol.  Before tip, a boba tea, Vietnamese coffee, two spring rolls, and two bowls of delicious pho came to $30. Not bad for being stuffed out of our gourds.  Overall: solid Vietnamese cuisine, frankly the best (excluding homemade) I've had in the Valley. For you Vietnamese noobs, the menu details everything clearly and is organized by types of noodles - a must for gluten-free eaters (the rice noodles are great!). However, I'll be sure to get there during their non-peak hours to skip the attitude.

The mojitos!! oh yes. I just wish they were more gluten-free friendly - everything is fried or sauced or battered.  My favorites - pork chile verde enchiladas topped with a fried egg, ceviche served with a side of the sweetest grilled corn, oh! and did i mention the mojitos?!  The patio is GORGEOUS, great ambiance and great for groups. The inside is a bit dark for my tastes. It gets so quiet and dark in the dining room away from the bar - great if you want that romantic date setting.

I was surprised to see so many low ratings for English Dermatology, so I wanted to chime in. I have been seeing Mindy, the PA, since 2010 for acne that has persisted since childhood. I've never had to wait more than 10 minutes in the waiting room, even when being early for my appointment. I love a punctual office that's respectful of my time!  I have to admit that when I went in for my initial appointment, I was a little defensive. I was sure a dermatologist was going to take one look at my skin and recommend a slew of over-the-top treatments and medications to deal with the years of scarring, cystic acne, stubborn blackheads, and eczema.  I was pleasantly surprised! Mindy was incredibly calm and respectful and she took great care to let me finish every thought. She listened to my concerns, then presented several options for medications and explained the pros and cons of each. I was really impressed that she didn't pressure me to choose one or the other, and she emphasized that we could always adjust dosage or prescriptions as needed. I've had quite a few doctors over the years who could learn a thing or two from her bedside manner.   I have had some frustrations over the years with the office staff. Especially around years 2011-2012, the MAs and office assistants were extremely disorganized, impatient, and copped an attitude when I had to call numerous times to straighten things out. Looking at other reviews, several of the complaints surrounding missing Rx forms seem to have occurred around that time period.  Thankfully, the last time I visited, I noticed many of those ladies were no longer there, so I'm hoping that situation has been resolved. All in all, I would happily recommend Mindy and this office to a friend!

As a young petite woman, I dread dealing with condescending mechanics, and particularly dealerships. I was SO delighted to find Independent Auto on Yelp. These guys are punctual, professional, and their estimates (time and cost) are spot on every time.  I've dealt primarily with Lee, who is quiet, respectful, and knows his stuff. My '10 Jetta Wolfsburg is still under powertrain warranty, and Lee advised me that a tranny problem I was experiencing was actually quite common and should be covered under my powertrain - but I'd have to go to the dealer. (Groan.)  After several days, the dealer still couldn't duplicate the problem, and I was beyond frustrated with the rep's flippant attitude. I called Lee, described what was happening, and asked for advice. He told me to ask to drive my car with the mechanic riding along to duplicate the issue, and told me if they wouldn't agree to that, I should call VW corporate, who would definitely take care of me.  He assured me the issue was totally legit - and that I was not hallucinating, as the dealer seemed to think. I was so impressed that Lee helped me nail down a fix when he didn't stand to make a dollar on the repair. After the dealer's mechanics got on the phone with corporate "super mechanics," they eventually traced the problem to the mechatronics unit in the transmission - which was not only covered under warranty, but it was exactly what Lee had diagnosed in the first place.

Hana is great! The service can be a bit scattered at times, but the food is consistently excellent AND they have gluten-free soy sauce available. Just ask. The chefs are also aware of gluten-free considerations and don't drown everything in soy sauce and crunchy stuff.  I'd love to see a bigger, more varied menu! And maybe stop writing the specials on the whiteboard in orange marker - impossible to read. It's not pretentious or fancy schmancy but can totally be a fun date! BYOB!

I've been to other mediocre Chili's in Phoenix, but this location is my favorite. The bar looks like it's been recently remodeled and has a cool modern vibe. I love the padded, high-backed barstools and we've only experienced friendly bartenders who know better than to rush you through your meal.  I LOVE the blackberry margarita (and I'm not even a big marg drinker) and the chicken enchilada soup (I add extra lime to mine). The sliders were so-so, but for five bucks (happy hour), what the heck.

Hubby and I tried out Gallo Blanco for date night and we were legitimately impressed.  The vibe reminds me of St. Francis on Camelback - young, hip, a little loud, smallish menu, hoppin' patio. Hubby had the Picoso - muddled pineapple with jalapeno and a smooth Reposado finish. The drink was a masterpiece, but he admitted it gave him a little heartburn later (well worth it, anyway). I enjoyed the Prickly Pear Margarita complete with Sauza Blanco, which struck a perfect balance between sweet, tangy, & fruity.  We started with the Queso Fundido appetizer and added seasonal veggies - a mix of caramelized zucchini, summer squash, mushrooms, onions, sweet corn, and spinach. The sweetness of the caramelized veggies complemented the salty nature inherent to Mexican food beautifully. The queso did get a touch greasy at the end, but c'est le fromage.  We dove in with a variety of tacos for dinner - ordering an ahi tuna, slow braised pork, and carne asada beef taco each. I highly recommend ordering a side of beans for the table, to add to the tacos or to eat as a side - these were some of the richest, smoothest refried pinto beans I've ever come across. They didn't skimp on the taco filling, either - three tacos each was plenty for each of us. I love a place that doesn't skimp on the protein!! I also love a place that serves breakfast ALL DAY. You better believe I'll be back for that.  The tacos & queso were both served with corn tortillas, and my gluten-free hubby had no issues diving right in. The service was top notch, too - our waitress was incredibly warm and chatty and made helpful suggestions with each step of the order. She also did a great job of pacing the food perfectly, despite how slammed the kitchen must have been at that point.  We were both too stuffed to go for dessert, but I'd love to try the orange layer cake or crepes on a future visit. But $50 for two drinks, app, two dinners and sides - not too shabby in my book. This would be a great place to stop in for drinks & dessert, too, maybe at the bar or lounge area. I'll be back!

Hubby and I made the trek up from Central Phoenix today for something different for lunch. We were pleasantly surprised to find this wasn't a pretentious Scottsdale joint - the atmosphere was actually quite unassuming and welcoming. We were greeted immediately by the hostess and seated at a table near the bar, in the middle of the dining room.   Our waitress seemed genuinely happy to be there, giving us a quick back-story of the restaurant (food's local, trucked in each morning, lots of gluten-free options) as she took our drink order. I'm a bit of a coffee freak, and there wasn't anything remarkable about this coffee, though it wasn't bad. I added a decent amount of (fresh) cream to my cup to cut down on the bitterness. Perhaps I'm a stickler for tradition, but I prefer my coffee in a good ol' ceramic mug, rather than the glass, handled Irish coffee mug presented. I don't think the glass keeps the coffee hot as long as ceramic - which was unfortunate, because after ordering our food, we didn't see the waitress again until after our food was delivered by another waiter. Me + lukewarm coffee = sad :(  I settled on the Monte Cristo - two slices of french toast with melted gruyere, ham, and strawberry jam - with a side of roasted red potatoes. I was concerned about the saltiness of the ham overpowering the sandwich, but it was a delightfully balanced blend of savory and sweet. The maple syrup provided on the side was a perfect complement. My potatoes were also done perfectly - with sliced white onions, not too crunchy but not slimy, either. Hubby ordered the steak & eggs with two slices of gluten-free toast (from the Gluten-Free Creations Bakery in uptown Phoenix) and black beans. The waitress mentioned that all of their breakfast sides are gluten-free - it's nice to have some variety for a change. He hasn't stopped talking about his eggs all day. He ordered them over medium, and they tasted fresh and were actually cooked to his liking - no wiggly white, no chalky yolk. The seasoning in the tenderloin (roughly six ounces - all meat, mind you, no fat or bone to carve away) was seasoned perfectly to complement the eggs.  By the time our food had arrived, we decided we wanted to try the bloody mary after reading Andrea S's review below. Our waitress didn't mind at all that we wanted to "split" the $8 drink and it arrived promptly. Made with cucumber vodka and stuffed to the brim with produce, this was one of the lightest and freshest bloody marys I've ever enjoyed. I've never seen pickled green beans in a bloody mary before - Hubby and I spent a good ten minutes trying to guess what they'd been marinated in (cloves? cinnamon??). The verdict - spicy and refreshing!  In short...the pros and cons:  Pros -  - Delicious, local food - Friendly, decidedly un-Scottsdale service - Clean, modern, spacious bathrooms (they even have those nifty Dyson hand-dryers, ooh!) - Unique & varied drink menu - Urban, industrial decor with colorful splashes of art deco - Filling (!) brunch for two for $40 - not too shabby  Cons -  - Coffee was meh, went cold in between touch-ups  - Dining room was a bit crowded (I think my chair was bumped five times), and metal & concrete furnishings makes for a bit of a loud breakfast  All in all, we felt welcomed and appreciated. We'll be back!

We returned the other day and, remembering how salty the monte cristo was, I asked if I could sub some of their amazing bacon for the traditional ham. Our waitress was happy to oblige my request (no upcharge) and the sandwich was amazing. The gently sweet, smoky bacon flavor was a much better complement to the buttery gruyere than the salty ham. Try it with the bacon - perfection!

Growing up in Phoenix has made me a bit of a Mexican food snob, and in the land of many 'bertos, I was wary of trying yet another place. I'm happy we did - the food has been consistently delish and the service incredibly friendly.  What hasn't been consistent are the hours. The menu says the place is open 8 am to midnight, with a 24-hour drive-thru. (Yelp thinks it's 7 am to 10 pm.) The last several times we've driven by, the lights have been off. I've tried calling the number on the site (also the number on Yelp) and all I get is an automated "this voicemail box is full." I tried sending an email to the address listed on the site, but that came back undeliverable. So, what's the deal? Does anyone know when this place is open?

Can't believe I've lived in Central Phoenix for five years and am just now finding Melrose Kitchen. Hubby and I stopped in on a Saturday morning around 10 am, and I was expecting the place to be packed - but thankfully, it wasn't. In fact, aside from the shrieking kids behind us, it was pleasantly calm.  The first thing I noticed walking in is the mix of colorful and eclectic decor - it has a real personality, not a cold cafeteria feel. The second thing I noticed was that the eating area was very clean - no dust on the decor, no torn seats, no forgotten crumbs on the tables.  We were helped by three different servers throughout the meal, but our primary waitress was very friendly and bubbly. Our coffee arrived quickly, tasted strong and fresh, and was refilled frequently - a must-have element of any respectable diner. I ordered the huevos rancheros and my husband, who is on a strict GF diet, had the homemade corned beef hash. After reading Yelp reviews, I was prepared to wait for the food, and we were in no rush.   The food was worth the wait. Our eggs were cooked exactly as we'd ordered them, the beans had a gentle spicy kick, the tortillas weren't soggy, the hash browns were fresh with good texture, and there was just enough cheese to add good flavor without drowning the dish in a pile of oil. The homemade corned beef had a rich and unique flavor that I couldn't quite place - I'm not usually a corned beef freak, but theirs might just convert me. There was a full bottle of tabasco right on the table, which always makes me happy.  After we scraped our plates clean, the wait staff was happy to clear the table and keep topping off our coffee. We didn't feel rushed as we enjoyed the atmosphere (and caffeine).   Would love more GF-friendly options on the menu, but at $20 for two (pre-tip), I've found my new local diner!

I liked the concept, but found the product mediocre. For example, I was excited to try the steak & blue salad, but the "steak" was dry and crumbled, not sliced meat as I was expecting.  They offer GF crust, but there's plenty of cross-contamination and the staff makes no effort to know or check on the ingredients in the toppings (like the meats). If you're truly gluten-sensitive, skip it.

I really tried to give this location a fair shake, but in the last 3-4 attempts, I've experienced the following... - screwed up orders  - orders screwed up even after re-explaining the order (iced coffee with coconut milk? Is it that hard?) - fancy new order screen where you can review and approve your order...if they bothered to use it   And, the icing on the cake: - getting stuck in the drive-thru for 30 minutes (no exaggeration) and failing to get as much as an apology from the barista. (But my order was correct!)  That last (and final!) time, I actually called corporate from the drive-thru to tell them to get some new management in here, pronto. Props to corporate customer service - they were very gracious and loaded up my gift card in apology.   Save yourself the agony and go up the street to 7th Ave & Missouri. Thank me later (maybe I'll see you there!)

I was a little nervous trying out a new location, but found myself pleasantly surprised! It's clear corporate brought in experienced employees from nearby stores to get this one off the ground on the right foot.   I work up the street and visit once or twice a week to get out of the office. The staff is friendly and my order is accurate and speedy. On a recent visit, the lady ahead of me was trying to buy a bunch of gift cards in the drive-thru (wtf?), and the barista comped my whole order in apology for the wait. Solid customer service.   My only complaint is that because the plaza is still fairly new, some of the contractors from nearby businesses have a habit of taking a smoke break behind Starbucks (along the drive-thru). So if you dislike smoke, roll your window up in a hurry as you pull around ;)
