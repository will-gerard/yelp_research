Moved back to Arizona and had no idea who to see for routine dental work. Started seeing Dr. Schwartz a couple years ago and now the whole family sees him. He's a perfectionist!! He has helped me find an orthodontist for my son, put me in invisilign to straighten my smile, fixed cavities, done whitening treatments and done all of our cleanings, etc. He's done it all and I would proudly and confidently send anyone his way. The entire staff are amazing - welcoming and warm. I look forward to all my dental visits!!!

Not impressed at all- poor service, poor attention to drinks, orders etc. our server rarely made it by to check on us regarding food drinks and water- order was messed up and it took til the end of my meal to fix it! For what you pay at such a nice upscale resort , service was far below par!
