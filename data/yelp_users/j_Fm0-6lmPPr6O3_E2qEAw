I bought a brand new book recently and did not notice it had some damage to the pages. Went back a couple of days later as I was busy throughout the week. They told me that the damage was my fault. I was shocked that they would blame me, I didnt notice it until I arrived home. And to top it off I had to pay the original price to get a exchange. It was on sale when I bought it.  I tried shopping here previously before this experience and always had high hopes. But im sad to say I will not be back. I will be taking my shopping elsewhere.

I live right down the road from this place and never have been in before until today.   My first experience with BOBA was in San Francisco in 2002.  Ill admit that the first time i tried it i was really taken aback. Well fast forward to today, me and a coworker were having lunch at lee's sandwiches across the street and i told her about this place.  Me with my very lame description, She had no idea what i was talking about.  I forgot what the BOBA balls were made of.   Well today after lunch i said we should go over to the Boba Tea House and give it a whirl.  We ordered a iced coffee and BOBA, only thing that was kinda annoying was having to pay cash. They do not accept cards if it is under 5 bucks.  But i can get over that.    Now to the description, and ill be honest i really enjoyed the iced coffee the drink was made pretty decently, this is no sour tasting coffee.  The drink it reminded me of 2003 all over again, seeing my surprised coworkers face after drinking her first drink of BOBA.  After a long discussion about how weird it was, but a fun drink. I think we will be back again in the near future . I know i will be with my wife and daughter!  this would be a fun place if your just hanging out and want a cold drink, especially here in the desert.  Or if you are on a date or in high school.

I have been to this place twice so far, and each time I have enjoyed my visit. The parking is a little pain, but not so bad you drive around in circles for half a hour. The staff is very nice and very courteous but a little bit slow. I have noticed this both times I have been there. The food is a little expensive but with huge portions.  I must say though the menu is long and extensive and that worries me a bit. When I think long menu I thing frozen lots of frozen. But that could be just me. I do notice that they serve mimosas which is a big plus in my book.  Now the food portion of the review, the other guests that I have been with said there food was delicious, it looked to be really good. The first time I went one of my coworkers had the "Old Fashioned Borenstein Burger" and the other had a "Monte Cristo" and it was huge. Today I went with my family, my daughter had the "Silver Dollar Pancakes" which were not silver dollar pancakes, but crazy HUGE pancakes. It makes me wonder what a normal pancake looks like. My wife had a "Classic Belgian Waffle" with candied pecans mixed in. sadly the pecans came piled on top and were not candied.   I must admit I have not tried anything but there "Old Fashioned Borenstein Burger". And it is huge and delicious I usually get mine with bacon and cheese, the fries are awesome they are not your usual wimpy fries, they are steak sized but have a flakiness to them if that makes any sense at all. Overall I'm in love with their burger, but you would need to do something seriously wrong to make me dislike a burger.  And one more thing, its dangerous to have a bakery right there displaying awesome sweets. I'm usually not into sweets but on a whim my coworker told me to pick something and the "Like Heaven" little cups caught my eye. Tried the Oreo one which is a chocolate cup with cream and bits of what look like crumbled Oreos on top, which might explain the name, and just to let you know good lord it was like heaven! If heaven is like that, I will gladly serve the lord so I can get some more of those tasty little treats. Today on my visit I bought three, one for my daughter and two for me. I know, I know.  Well in the end this place is decent the prices are a little high, but the food is good and you get your monies worth. Next time ill try something else maybe breakfast who knows.

This was me and my wife's First time here, and we had never been to palette before, But from what everyone tells me this place is a step up.   We had gone on a Sunday about 2 in the afternoon with a group of friends. The atmosphere was really laid back, On first glance the outside is pretty nice if it didn't look like it was going to storm I'm pretty sure we would have sat outside.   We were seated promptly inside the building. The inside was nice and basic tables and chairs, a older phoenix home converted to a restaurant a nice cozy place. With local artwork placed on the walls. I like to go to the bathroom and on the way back check out the art pieces.    The waitress was really nice and very fast she gave us our menus and left us to make our drink choice, I ordered a mimosa and water, and when she came back to get our food order for my dish I ordered a Coca Cola Ham Omelet with Pumpernickel Toast.     First off let me say the mimosa was pretty damn good.  Nice and strong.  So good in fact we finished our first glass and ordered a second.   Yes I was buzzed, but through my little buzz I noticed that our food was taking awhile to get to us. There were 5 people at our table and I know it takes time to get those orders ready. But it did seem like it took some time. I think that was the only real complaint.   When the food finally made it to us, It was hot but not super hot I would say more like lukewarm. Not to my liking and my wife and friends agreed. The Omelet was big with lots of ham and eggs. Just to make sure of the taste I made sure to clean my palette with the glass of water I believe if you are trying something for the first time the first bite determines how everything else tastes.  Well let me say that it was good real good, but wasn't the best. I expect a Coca Cola Ham Omelet to have a distinct taste of Coca Cola. I want it to be sweet and flavorful releasing all kinds of sensations on my taste buds. Who knows maybe the mimosa threw off my taste buds.    But don't get me wrong it wasn't awful, it was a good effort on the chefs part. But maybe it needs to marinate a bit more. I don't know I'm no chef but I know I like to eat.  But I will admit the flavor finally made a real appearance in the last 2 or 3 bites of the omelet. And yes I ate the whole thing cause hey I like to eat.  Would I order it again? Maybe but I would give something else a try first.    All in all it was a good experience the food and company was good and we enjoyed it. I will be back again, but as I said trying something different. I think this place has a real chance of becoming something great. They just have to work on getting that food super hot.    And a side note my wife who does not drink tried my omelet and she liked it better than her plate.

This shop is one of the best I have found, I live in chandler and live less than 2 miles away from other shops, But instead i love going here. The prices are always excellent and the mechanic is always willing to help, One time he even took about 30 minutes trying to fix a part for me.   I recommend this shop to everyone in the area as well as surrounding areas, give them a visit as it will be worth it.
