Worst service ever! Guy could barely speak English, confused 2 tacos with no cheese for a breakfast jack and a biscuit sandwich, pulled up to window and he was talking in his headset to another employee and said "wish we could just turn this sign off". Seriously? Messed up a simple order, went back through the line and he just put the bag out the window and didn't even make eye contact and said "dat it". Didn't receive a receipt and food was gross. Will NEVER go back to this location. Go to whataburger on 43rd and bell, the night guy there is awesome!

Absolutely LOVE Buffalo Wild Wings but will never return to this location. Went for dinner on a Sunday n I was pretty patient considering they were slammed cuz football. Waited about 40mins for our food which came out wrong n I had ordered 8 boneless wings n received six. Service was terrible. Manager took 20% off our bill, but was rude n server appeared confused about it. I will drive 30 mins to a different location. Highly disappointed.

I had a completely flat tire that could be heard leaking air. Took my car in and they fixed my tire at no charge within an hour. The shop was busy so the short wait time was impressive. Great customer service and very quick. Best experience with a tire shop that I have ever had. Will definitely be returning for any future tire issues.

I have never rented a bounce house before and received Mr. Bs by referral. Did an awesome job from the start. Everyone I dealt with was professional and answered all my questions. The guy who set up, kept in contact and told me to call when I was done. Highly recommend their services. I will only use them in the future.

Horrible experience. I went in for what I thought was a kidney infection. Although i had tender kidneys and bladder, i was diagnosed with a uti because "i didn't look sick enough". Doctor came in chewing, as if I was interrupting her lunch, and spent less then 5 minutes with me. I asked her if I had a fever as i was leaving and her response was "I don't know. Did you have one at home?". I will NEVER go back to this place.

We went there because my little guy's name is Leo so we thought we should give it a try! The pepperoni pizza was delicious and they had local craft beers on draft. We did meet Leo the owner who was very friendly and made us feel welcome. The cashier Samantha was adorable and very nice. They both acknowledged my son beyond expectations (which is huge for a mommy) and even surprised him with a yummy cannoli at the end. We will definitely be back!
