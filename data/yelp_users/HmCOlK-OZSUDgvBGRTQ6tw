I've been there twice now and had excellent service.  Had 3 friends with me who all liked their dish.  3 out of the 4 dishes were amazing while the 4th was good but nothing to be happy about.  gemeli was great.  and my chicken f alfredo was great as well.  Bread and pesto was great too for the price you are paying on the meal.  I will be going back more often.  Once a week.

This is by far the worst rental company I've had to deal with. The staff are horrible. Their customer service skills are worse than mcdonalds employees. Maintenance is required monthly. Takes about a week or so before they even show up to do the maintenance. A/C goes out during the summer at least once a week. Hot water was shut off for days at a time. I could go on...

Amazing Food!!!! Place looks like a dive and it could use a better AC but the price and taste of the food made it all worth it!!! New AC and they get 5 stars!

EVERY time i order from this place it takes them a minimum of 45 minutes to get my food.  This is supposed to be the fastest delivery.  They do not make any attempts to make it right either.  Horrible customer service and slow delivery.  Food is typical jimmy johns except by time i get my food its been in a delivery drivers vehicle for at least 20 minutes while he's making other runs.  Never again.

The place is great.  Great seats. Great sound.  Worth the extra money depending on what I am watching.  When i found out they don't do child prices after 6 pm.  Well, that's just greed at its finest.  I will never go to Camelview ever again.  And if its convenient for me to go to another theater instead of Harkins I will choose them to make a point.

Sooooooooo good. Fast and seemingly fresh. Not bad for 11 bucks. Not sure what else there is to say other than that.
