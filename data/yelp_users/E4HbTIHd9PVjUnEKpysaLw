If you're looking for a place of elegance, this is not the place for you.  It's dark, dingy and a hole in the wall ..... and the food is AMAZING.  Five of us went in for lunch on a Friday afternoon (one being a former Texan, only just moving to Arizona two months ago) and the wait for a table was non-existent.  Our service was very good and attentive.  Three of us ordered the chicken fried steak and two of us ordered the BBQ brisket sandwich.  Every single one of us was extremely pleased with our food and SO MUCH FOOD.  I would definitely recommend this place for some good Texan food!  Prices were unbelievably reasonable as well.

My husband's and mine new favorite local dive bar .... only a $7.50 uber ride back home :) The place is dark, old, and just divey but awesome! Cheap drinks, tons of dart machines, foosball, and two pool tables ... plus bags/cornhole in the summer.  They have a nice big outdoor patio too.  The bar starts getting really busy around 8:30 to 9:30 pm on the weekends with a late 20's to late 30s crowd, which I was extremely surprised about.

my fiance and I absolutely love Chompie's Deli .... this one is not nearly as busy as the location in Tempe, which is definitely nice.  This one, instead of the 18-22 year old clientele, is definitely the senior citizen location :) They still have a deli, take-out, and sit-down options, along with a full bar :) I cannot go without getting the Jewish sliders ... they are just too good!!!

my fiancee got my engagement ring here and we both bought our wedding bands as well.  Their customer service is well above any other jewelry store we had been to.  We went browsing for my engagement ring at the end of 2012 and so many jewelry stores do not listen to you when you discuss your budget and that infuriates me.  Everyone we talked to at Shane Co kept our budget in mind, listened to all questions, explained everything in detail, without ever making us feel rushed.  Their service center is fantastic as well - I have had to get my engagement ring resized twice and my wedding band once and everything is always done on time.  They also clean your ring whenever you come in :) Always a nice perk! It's no wonder they won Arizona Weddings best jeweler in 2013 and The Knot Best Of Weddings 2013.

I have found my favorite dive bar on the west side ..... I went with my bf and a couple of friends and this place was an absolute people-watchers dream come true!  All ages are welcome here from your barely legal to just starting a family to retired and everywhere in between :)  Drink prices are fantastic and this place is way bigger than you would think.  There were three completely separate bar areas and it was huge.  Karaoke night on Fridays! They advertise off-track betting but I didn't see it (nor did I look too hard)  Cash only!

We went to see Louis CK on Friday, 10/28.  The layout is very good and the ticket prices were EXTREMELY reasonable.  Acoustics were great for a stand-up show.  The only negative was that, I'm a pretty small person and I feel kinda squished in the sold-out arena.  The leg room is fine for legs but small when considering the amount of people who get up to go to the bathroom throughout the show --- like a movie theatre, it took everyone getting up and people struggled to get through which obviously made it difficult for the people behind it to see anything.

I volunteered here with about 20 other co-workers and I full recommend donating or volunteering your time to assist them.  They are the 2nd largest food bank in the country and AZ statistics are not favorable in seniors, families and children not knowing where their next meal is going to come from.  They were extremely organized in getting us all together and I am very proud to have volunteered my time there.  Several of us are planning on going back once a month to give back even more.

This is a mom-and-pop shop ... .I believe the wife does the tailoring and the husband does the shoe repair.  All I know is that I brought my favorite black peep-toe shoes in hoping for a miracle and he did an absolutely wonderful job.  My shoes were in AWFUL condition (which just as another reviewer got, I received a mild and endearing scolding for how awful I let my shoes become!! haha) and he wasn't 100% sure he would be able to fix them.  Let's just say, he worked a miracle.  I had worn the rubber piece of my heels down to the nail and the soles were a mess.  For $65, he fixed both of them and completely cleaned up the worn parts of the leather.  They looked absolutely beautiful and I'm wearing them now :) I thought they were going to have to be tossed (which I was hesitant to do because girls - you know how hard it is to find shoes you love and are comfortable!!!) and now I don't have to!!!

absolute hole in the wall but by far the most tasty subs around.  Forget subway!  You drive up to this tent-like circus building and you can't prepare for the interior decor :)  You find something new to read every time you're there!!  They have a good variety of hot & cold subs and very tasty!! I would definitely recommend for a fast lunch spot!

I head to Romanelli's for their deli section and eat in .... their food is fantastic.  True Italian food ... no one I've been there with has been disappointed.  Make sure you come hungry because portions are BIG and you will leave stuffed.  They also have a huge assortment of grocery items (ie - pasta sauce, pasta, etc)

I've only ever been during NFL football Sundays and it's PACKED!! Which is fun but make sure you get there between 9:15-9:30 to guarantee yourself a table where you can actually see your game!  They do have a TON of TVs, although some are 13" so you better sit close ;)  They have a breakfast buffet between 9 - 11 am until their kitchen opens.  The food isn't great but it gets you through the day.  Some good beer specials, which is rare on game day.

How am I the duchess and haven't written a full review yet??? Dos Gringos is my total go-to for happy hours and nights out.  Mini chimis are absolutely delicious and frequent beer specials.  It's my #1 spot for day drinking, which they proudly advertise!  I've spent New Years Eve here two years in a row, my 30th birthday, AND even the start to my bachelorette party! As I said, it's one of my favorites in Scottsdale.

My bf and one of our friends had gone out to dinner thinking we would grab something casual and watch the Coyotes play at "The Keg" ..... we were VERY wrong about the atmosphere of this restaurant!! With a name like "the Keg", we assumed sports bar (we should have looked it up on Yelp first....) and we were dead wrong as we walked into a white linen tablecloth restaurant and NOT a sports bar!  We ended up sitting in the lounge/bar area though because, well, we DID want to watch the Coyotes' game!  Our service started off horrendous ... you would have thought we were a group of 14 years olds after a school dance the way our server didn't want to wait on us.  I'm not sure if she was just super busy or ditzy or what but I was pretty irritated since instead of some casual sports bar, we were now paying $25 for a steak and $10 for martinis!  After we hadn't seen our server for a good 10-15 minutes and then she botched our drink order, the manager had stopped in to see how we were doing.  I was honest and said our server had been inattentive so we were kind of frustrated.  Oh my god did he make things right.  I felt bad for the server because he obviously went to talk to her but then we had the manager and the server checking in on us to the point, I was actually slightly embarassed for so much attention.  The manager absolutely made our experience a complete 180 from our first 20 minutes and I was very thankful .... let's just say, she deserved her 20% tip by the end of our meal :)

let's be serious ..... it's Ruth's Chris, how could I be disappointed?  My husband and I had our rehearsal dinner there and except for a small hiccup (my father-in-law had said we could NOT go over 2 hours, without exception, and our dessert had been held up because my hubby and I were giving our bridal party gifts and speeches and the staff didn't want to interrupt so we never got our dessert .... it was promptly removed from my in-laws' bill without question or hesitation), the service, food, and atmosphere was amazing.  We, along with the in-laws, dealt solely with Chelsea Helstab (sales and catering manager) and she couldn't have been more responsive. The wait staff that night was so on-point .... available whenever we needed them, refilling drinks quickly, yet never seemed to be hovering or there "too much".  It's pricey but for a special event like this? You can't go wrong.

My experience here was absolutely amazing.  My boyfriend and I had reservations for 7:30 pm on a Saturday night and the service was amazing and the food was spectacular.  It was extremely pricey but oh my god, was it worth it.  My bf and I have both lived in Baltimore, MD for the last 7 years so we are extremely picky and spoiled when it comes to seafood .... Salt Cellar completely changed my mind that you can't find good seafood in AZ.    Only recommendation?  Make sure you have reservations because the seating area is tiny.

The staff here is great.  I got into a fender bender with a State Farm customer so I went to one of State Farm's preferred auto body shops.  I went in on a Monday afternoon to just get an estimate done and they were able to take my car that day with a promise it would be done by the end of the week.  I wish I had gotten a call a little earlier than half an hour before they closed on Friday (since they are closed through the weekend) but bright and early on Monday morning, I was able to pick up my car and it looked great.  I don't have a single complaint about the work done here or the staff

Apparently this place underwent a renovation and let me tell you, it's a fantastic renovation, whatever they did! The pro-shop is large and extensive, you can find all of your golfing needs there (clubs, bags, shoes, clothes....).  Note this is NOT a course, it's only a driving range and pro-shop.  The driving range is awesome.  It's a double decker range, which I have never been to, plus it's automated balls & tees! You pay inside the golf course for a certain number of balls and it will keep track for you, plus the computer tells you exactly how far each of the flags are from you, which is pretty nice for a beginner .... and MISTERS in the summer!! For all you Phoenicians, you understand how important this is!!!!! :)  They also do lessons but I have not signed up for them --- yet.  I plan to though!

I had two experiences with Los Sombreros .... One dining and one trying to get a reservation for a large party. My future in-laws were trying to decide on a place to make a reservation for about 20 people for dinner two nights before my fiance's and mine wedding.  They sent us on a mission to try out Old Tortilla Factory and Carlsbad Tavern.  We knew the atmosphere of Carlsbad Tavern, knew it wasn't what they were looking for, and found Los Sombreros on yelp.  They had good reviews and what looked like a very cozy atmosphere on the patio so we gave it a try.  We tried both restaurants and could not express how much better Los Sombreros was, the atmosphere, the food, the service .... hands down, we wanted them to book the dinner reservation here.  Well that's where my five-star review is a one-star review and I felt the experience trying to book the reservation outweighed the dinner service so they now have a one-star review.  My in-laws called them, spoke to Miriam and requested to reserve the patio for the night in question (mind you, this was about 6 weeks out so we were giving them plenty of time .... they said the more time we could give them, the better it was for them).  Miriam took the reservation but needed a credit card to hold the spot.  My in-laws thought that was weird but gave it to them anyway.  There were a few questions that she couldn't answer so requested their contact information to have her manager Jesus call them back the next day. No one ever called them back so two nights later they called again and reached Umberto.  They explained what had happened and that no one called them back and requested to speak to a manager. Umberto asked how he could help so my in-laws thought they were speaking to a manager and proceeded to tell him that they spoke to Miriam but because no one had ever called them back, they wanted to cancel the reservation.  When my in-laws said they were going to cancel the reservation, Umberto said "well we already have your credit card number".  My in-laws had to cancel their credit card number because they were afraid they would be charged for the reservation of 20 people anyway! How can you ever recommend a restaurant that you're trying to give them a party of 20 people on a normally not too busy night (Thursday night) and they still threaten to charge your credit card because they have the number? We will never go back and I definitely can't recommend it to anyone.

I didn't stay at Bellagio which is why I cannot give a 5-star review (although, let's be serious .... it's the Bellagio, I'm sure the room is amazing).  We spent the majority of our time at the sports book, which let me tell you, if you're looking to have a few cocktails and bet on sports all day, GO TO THE BELLAGIO! They are the only sports book that will give you a drink for free and without spending like, over $100 on one bet.  We had gone to the Wynn on our last day and couldn't order a drink because we didn't have a drink coupon ... because we didn't place a large bet.  Definitely go to the Bellagio for sports betting.  Huge room, tons of seating and tons of TVs :)

This place is delicious.  Five of us went for breakfast after running the AZ Urban Race and it was exactly what we needed.  Huge menu and the food was great.  I heart breakfast food!  The prices are slightly pricey for a breakfast menu but nothing unreasonable.  Plus - you get a LOT of food.

suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuch a dive bar in Old Town, which is refreshing!! My husband and I even took the after party of our wedding down to DJs ... what a sight we were --  my wedding gown, tuxes, and dresses galore taking over the bar.  I've been there a few times otherwise and service is always good and beer is cheap :)

Biggest. Waste. Of. Time. Ever. Hubs and I sent them multiple pictures of a dining room set to sell and their response times were lackluster at best. We gave them our desired price and scheduled a last minute inspection of the furniture. "Last minute" as in I had to ask to leave work early about 3 hours before they wanted to come. Luckily my job is flexible but seeing that they wanted to be at the house at 3, I left work early. The appointment was confirmed and we asked for a text when they were 10-15 minutes away. Take a guess what never happened. They never showed and never texted to cancel so I got to sit around for nothing. My husband called them and the guy started giving a bunch of BS excuses like we live 30 minutes away.... Okay? You knew this when you scheduled the appointment. Told my husband that he couldn't even say whether or not the guys coming to see the furniture would come. Wait, what? This is the way you do business?? Make a last minute appointment, cause someone to rearrange their schedule, and just never come? Waste of time ... Don't bother.

Staff is extremely nice (especially John). As a female, I didn't feel like I was being taken advantage of, which I get skeptical of the chain auto places. I had gone in for an oil change and to have my brakes checked out but found out all of my tires had to be replaced. They showed me the interior of my tires and pointed out the reasons and gave me options of brands to choose from. When I came in to get them replaced, they said they had been worried about me driving on them and took my car right in. I would definitely recommend them.

Places like G's is reason #74 why I love yelp. I would have never stumbled on this little gem without my boyfriend searching yelp for food close to the driving range we were at.  They have a ton of options for hotdogs and cheesesteaks, plus they deliver (no charge) ANYWHERE in the Valley!! Nobody does that!  Prices are super cheap so you can easily buy two of anything without it hurting the wallet ..... AND they have soft serve ice cream as dessert when you buy anything on the menu!

I never stayed here or visited here .... the one-star rating is because after my fiancee and I got engaged, he and I really wanted to take a tour of the facility as a possible wedding venue.  I emailed two different people three times with NO response.  We had seen ratings online and pictures on the website and were really excited that we could potentially have the wedding there but they never gave us the option since no one ever responded back to us.  I contacted Mari Lambie directly and their general email box mccormick@mhrmail.com both both were completely ignored.  These are the two email addresses that I had found online and my only contact information.  It is disappointing a venue would have this kind of customer service but I am very happy I did not follow through because I would never want to have a wedding venue where they do not respond back to you.

we were here for a friend's birthday (my fabulous maid of honor actually) .... the food is very tasty and there are plenty of options.  Good prices ..... the best thing?  They have these amazingly cheesy margarita mugs (you can buy them in either male or female ... I recommend one of each) that you can buy for about $10 but then you get $3.99 margarita refill!! Only $0.89 for flavors :) Limit two but they are strong :) It's a fun place, especially when you embarass your friends during their birthday with a singing staff! (bring your own sombrero for when they bust out the song .... the one thing they lack)

My parents were in town and rented a car with a local Enterprise while visiting me.  They made a week-long reservation and to be picked up at 9:30 a.m. on a Saturday, so we called and verified the pickup time.  They said they would be there between 9:30-10 am .... 10:30 am rolls around and my mom finally called them, to which they replied that the van had been outside for 45 minutes waiting for them to come outside.  This is ridiculous because we had all been looking outside every 10 minutes between 9:30 - 10:30 to make sure they didn't miss them.  They said they were calling my mom's cell phone, which unfortunately our house is like the Bermuda Triangle of cell phone reception; however, there were no missed calls showing and no messages.  We have an outside entrance and they knew our unit number and never knocked on the door or rang the doorbell.  The "great" CSRs (I don't want to even spell out the acronym because customer service it was NOT) then proceeded to tell my mom that if she wanted to rent from them, she had to find a ride or take a taxi.  Screw that! We decided to rent from Hertz.

this Philly girl was extremely happy :)  I was shocked to find a cheesesteak place that truly reminded me of home! but make sure you get 'wiz wit out' !!  Tiny tiny little place .... we were there in the middle of the day on a Saturday before school started so service or lines were definitely not a problem.  I can definitely see this place being crazy busy at around 1 am on a Friday night :)

Very good place for breakfast and their pies are to die for.  We've been here about five times and they never seem to be crowded, which is a shame.  Their staff is always friendly and the food is always good.  It's like a Dennys-type place, but I think the food tastes better.  I've honestly never had a lunch or dinner item but I don't think that's what you go here for :)  The prices are very reasonable.  Once again, pies are TO DIE FOR! We've had their strawberry pie (x2), pumpkin pie, peanut butter chocolate pie and most recently, their mixed berry pie.  We're going to be moving across the valley and I'm actually a little upset this location won't be coming with us.

I am definitely a fan of Joe's Farm Grill.  My bf and I went on a Sunday morning for breakfast and we were definitely pleased.  You order at a counter, find a table and wait for your buzzer to beep when they are ready.  The place was CROWDED with a ton of parents & kids, which was kind of annoying but hey, just because I don't have kids doesn't mean others aren't allowed to ;)  I had the Joe's Big Breakfast and my bf had the meat & potatoes .... everything was delicious.  Just make sure you're dressed for the weather because you are likely sitting outside at one of their picnic benches.

Well I've never actually reviewed a movie theater before but management went above and beyond my expectations. I stupidly bought movie tickets through Fandango at Harkins in Tempe but at Arizona Mills instead of Tempe Marketplace. The movie was starting in about 15 minutes and since I was meeting a friend, obviously couldn't just go to the other location. Management was extremely considerate, listened to what happened, and allowed me in the theater for the same movie. I was so surprised and thankful that I had to write a review.

my boyfriend and I went with another couple on Christmas Day and we were all very pleasantly surprised.  There was zero wait, the prices are extremely reasonable and you get a lot of food for your money.  Good service even though they did have a little mix-up on my order.... the other three meals came out on time but there was a mistake on mine so I had to wait a little longer.  Not a huge deal and I only had to wait about 5 minutes before mine came out.  Atmosphere is so-so ..... very casual. Two of us had the honey crispy chicken (very yummy), my bf had the General Tso's chicken, and the last had teriyaki chicken.  We were all very pleased.

I've eaten here three times and three times I got the Jewish sliders.  You really just can't go wrong with them :)  The only downside is because it's right on ASU campus, this place is PACKED basically at all times during the weekend but it's SOOOO worth the wait.

I can't believe I haven't reviewed our vet yet .....so my hubby and I had found a vet very close to our house and was just going to them (typical vet, worked mainly with dogs) until one of our boys got sick and the other vet had zero clue what was wrong.  Our friend had been going to SCC for a few months by that time so they came highly recommended.  Let's just say, my hubs and I are moving to Gilbert in a few weeks and I have zero intention of finding a new vet. From Tara at the front desk, to Katrina, to Dr Judy Karnia, everyone is just so pleasant, they know your pet and greet you warmly, and really care about the well-being of your feline.  When it comes to rush appointments for a sick feline, they have yet to disappoint and try to fit you in as soon as they can, which is such a nice relief.  I never want to go back to a multi-animal vet office again because they are specialized in felines while most vets tend to be more specialized/familiar with dogs.    House cat Christina is always there to greet you!

I won't lie .... I saw this restaurant featured on Man vs Food and had absolutely ZERO desire to eat here.  The sight of the food did not look appetizing to me.  OMG was I wrong! I went here to celebrate a co-worker's promotion and I absolutely raved about it for the rest of the day.  I had the Alambre de pollo Torta and I couldn't have been happier.  First off, the torta is massive. The only reason I got as close as I did to finishing it was because it was so amazing, I couldn't put it down.  Second off, well, it's amazing.  The only downside is that it gets crowded easily because it's still a pretty small place and because we went at lunch, it took an awfully long time to get our food ---- granted, we were a party of 8 so I'm not surprised.  I would definitely go again and would DEFINITELY recommend it to someone who's hungry!!

My boyfriend and I came here for dinner on a Friday night with his parents for his birthday celebration.  I had heard it gets backed and that I should make a reservation.  Trying to ensure no annoyances with waiting, I made sure to call early in the afternoon to ask for a 6:00 pm reservation.  They don't take reservations during that time ... okay, that's fine, I understand BUT they will accept call-aheads and they will make sure your name is already on the waiting list before you get there.  Woo! that works! I call at 5:30 pm and let them know we will be half an hour.  Due to the fact they did not have a wait at that time, they would not take my name or party information.  When we got there at 6 pm, they had a wait.  I was decently annoyed but since it was only a 15-20 minute wait for our table, I wasn't overly annoyed.  We got our table, our server, and placed our order.  Sadly, there were multiple tables around us in and out before we even got our entrees.  There were several tables that ended up having three parties in and out before we were finally done.  That was a pretty big annoyance to say the least, especially since we were pretty hungry and we saw other tables getting served at a much more rapid pace!!!  The place does extremely well because the food is absolutely AMAZING.  The seafood gets flown in daily and not too many seafood places in Arizona can say the same thing.  Despite the waits we had to have to get seated and to finally get our food and then the wait for dessert, I still managed to embarass myself with the amount of amazing tasting food I devoured

this location has an absolutely amazing cafe section .... I've never stepped foot into a Whole Foods so I won't lie, I don't know if that's normal at all locations or specific locations but I'm a huge fan.  There are several different stations, including sandwiches, Asian/sushi, pizza/italian ... AND a bar! haha.  Can't deny - I have never seen a grocery store with a full blown bar that has happy hours but that's kind of cool.  I went to the sandwich station for lunch and got a turkey, mozzarella, olive tapanas wrap which was delicious. Everything was extremely clean and well stocked in the middle of lunch hour, which is always a good sign :)

GREAT BBQ joint!!! Very hard to find, it's tucked away in the back corner of a shopping center but so amazingly tasty it's worth the few extra minutes it'll take you to find it.  Great lunch or early dinner spot to quench your BBQ craving!  I had the BBQ Beef Sandwich and my bf had the ribs.  Both of us were incredibly pleased.  Plus, the side dishes are a hearty helping so you can share :)  Very casual setting .... and it's a Steelers joint!  The owner went to school in Pittsburgh so my boyfriend was hooked the second we saw the Steelers flag hanging from the wall ;)

how haven't I raved about Camelback Moving yet????? My fiancee and I moved from Glendale to Scottsdale back in March 2013 and wanted to hire a different moving company at first (from a referral) but they were booked.  We saw Camelback Moving also had great reviews so we figured, might as well.  Omg, they were so professional and so fantastic, despite the fact mother nature really wanted us to have a miserable move.  It's Arizona ... in the desert .... why there was a monsoon and storms the one day we wanted to move, I have no idea but mother nature wanted to ruin our day!!! Our foreman and his two guys were so great ... we had packed everything ahead of time and taken most boxes down (we had a three story townhouse) to the first floor to try to get things moving quickly.  It took awhile to get things packed up but that's normal for a three-story townhouse and lots of furniture that you have to take apart :) So not only was mother nature not on our side, neither was their truck, because a tire blew out on the way over and they were about 2 hours delayed waiting for it to be changed.  Okay, kind of obnoxious but definitely not their fault.  Sooooooo the new house?  While the one-story layout looked fantastic to them ... our white carpets did not.  We did not have to say one word ... the foreman walked through the house, took a look at the carpets and instantly told his guys that no one was allowed to walk on the carpet with shoes on.  They had to drop everything into the kitchen first (tile) and take off their shoes before walking on carpet.  How awesome is that?!?!?!?!  They worked quickly, efficiently, and were very polite.  I would recommend them to anyone.

One word: impeccable. The staff is super friendly, the room was beautiful, you can order room service after a night of drinking .... What more can you ask for :)

I'm a big fan of BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse.  My boyfriend and I have been there three times and each time, were extremely happy.  The service has always been good and the food is delicious (especially the parmesan crusted chicken! yum yum).   I am usually a little hesitant with breweries because I have a very small range of beer that I find tasty but they have a few options that even I love! I definitely recommend!

I really like this place .... we've been there twice (once during football Sunday and once on a random weekday) and both times, really enjoyed the food and the service.  We just moved from Maryland recently and I graduated from the University of Maryland so I loved our UMD alum server too!  Yum yum wings and there are PLENTY of TVs throughout the restaurant, including TV & sound on their outdoor patio.  I would definitely recommend; however, if you're going for football, go early to guarantee yourself a table.

This would be a 3-star if I have ever received even remotely decent service.  I have been there twice, one time with almost no one there and one time during pre-season football and both times, I thought I was invisible, which is a shame because the food is actually pretty good.  When I was there when it was SLOW, we were at a table and we weren't really sure why we were getting ignored so badly.  The second time, we sat at the bar and maybe the bartender thought the groups of guys would tip better than my bf and I because she didn't give us the time of day .... come to think of it, NONE of the bartenders gave us the time of day.  I had to resort to putting my empty bottles on the edge of the bar for them to notice me and that was the only time they even looked our way.   It's a shame too because like I said, the food is actually pretty decent.

my boyfriend and I stopped by for an early dinner and there are zero complaints about this location.  It's a small shop, family-owned and the food was amazing (as long as you like cajun-style food).  My boyfriend is a huge fan of cajun food, spent a lot of time in New Orleans and loved the authenticity of FOL.  I am not nearly as familiar with cajun food and tried the fried pickles and alligator combo.  I loved it.  The helping was GENEROUS and definitely enough for leftovers.  The restaurant is going to be opening a second location in Phoenix and it should definitely be visited.

Very clean and nice stadium.  Went there for a spring training game and while the prices are your typical baseball/stadium pricing, I was impressed by how well the park was maintained.  Beware though - parking is on a dirt lot so your car will get dirty afterwards :(

I would like to point out first that yes, this resort is OFF the Strip (about a 15-20 minute drive off the Strip).  I stayed here for two nights for a work conference and it did not disappoint.  If you're looking to stay in Las Vegas but be away from the Strip craziness, this is a fantastic place to stay.  It's extremely modern and the hotel and rooms are absolutely beautiful and comfortable.  Sadly the spa was booked for a private conference/party while I was there so I didn't get a chance to check it out but there is absolutely NOTHING I can complain about here.  If you do not rent a car, they do have a shuttle until 8:30 pm to get to the Strip.  We had a car so I don't know exactly how often it runs or when it starts or where they drop you off from but I do know they have one.  We ate at the Vig Deli one night, which was great for a much less expensive meal (side note: if you order the $3 side of fries, you will probably not need more than one for your table .... we didn't know that and had more fries than we even knew what to do with!).  Baby Cakes is also a very delicious coffee and dessert shop.  I didn't have the dessert but I had the Vanilla Cream Latte and I definitely had to have two! I'm not even a latte person!!  As expected, drinks were expensive but it's a casino in Las Vegas -- you can't be surprised :) Go to a liquor store beforehand and drink in your room if you're looking to get drunk.  Besides the obvious priciness, I would recommend The M for anyone looking to stay at a great place off the Strip

I can't recommend Serendipity 3 for anything but going there just to say you did.  Our service was TERRIBLE, it took probably about an hour and a half to get our food (and we went in between the breakfast and lunch crowds) and one of the meals was sent back.  The prices are astronomical, which I'm sure is because of the name and not because of the quality.  My egg-white omelette was not good enough to be $14, I'm sorry.  The mother/daughter duo that I went with ordered the shrimp fritatta ($18) and on their plate was a small egg-white omelette, one large shrimp cut in two, one asparagus spear and covered in a huge helping of arugula lettuce.  They ended up sending it back because, well, it had one shrimp and one spear of asparagus.  When they asked to order something else because it wasn't what they thought it was, we received a snotty response from the server.  Let's just say our 9% gratuity was about 4% more than he should have received.  The best item our group received was the kid's fruit bowl for the 3-year old in our group.

Stop by here for breakfast and your morning coffee :) I was pleasantly pleased when I was looking for a small breakfast place (and not wanting to get the buffet).  I had a fruit, yogurt & granola parfait and two of their Vanilla Cream Lattes .... delicious!  Since it was early in the morning, I tried to avoid the fantastic looking desserts that they had but based on what I DID have, I wouldn't be surprised if they were just as delicious!!

I've given McFaddens two chances, both at incredibly slow times and both times, the service was terrible and slow.  The first time we were there, I'm pretty sure our server didn't realize she was supposed to be working and it was NOT busy in there.  I wish the food was good enough and it outweighed the bad service but it's just typical bar food.

My bf and I both got make-your-own burgers (I ordered bison and he ordered kobe) and thought they were absolutely amazing.  There are so many choices. Make sure you go when you're hungry bc it is a LOT of burger! Service was fantastic

My boyfriend and another couple came in a few Friday nights ago after seeing some comedy at Stand Up Scottsdale; we didn't have full meals but had a few glasses of wine and some bruschetta.  The bruschetta is absolutely to die for (we had four different kinds) and they have an extensive wine menu.  There was live music outside on the patio and the atmosphere was pretty good.  I'm not really sure why it's not a 5-star .... it's not a completely RAVE place but I definitely didn't have any complaints.  The service was very good, food was delicious and wine was tasty :)  We will definitely be going back!

Dillons is Dillons .... the restaurant itself is nothing spectacular (it's not bad ... it's actually pretty good) but the view at Scorpion Bay Marina is absolutely beautiful.  When we went, we ate outside right on the deck on the marina and it has a gorgeous view, literally on the water.

I do like the facility here.  It's very big with a large staff and very easy to get an appointment.  They've even been accommodating to me as a walk-in when I first got my concussion.  I was seen within a half hour and I didn't have an appointment.  I definitely can't complain about that.  You're able to make an appointment online (or at least make the request for the appointment), which is convenient.  There's a pharmacy on premises, which is always helpful when you don't want to make a second trip.  The only reason this is not a 5-star is because before I moved, my PCP was a one-man practice.  It's hard to get used to being one of hundreds of patients and not really getting a connection to a single doctor the way you can with a small practice.  I've been trying to see the same doctor (Kimberly Brabentz) and she is really good.

So I have to leave two separate comments about this office. From a personal basis, since the day I walked in (well, actually kind of hobbled at a 45 degree angle and was probably limping a little bit), the staff (everyone from Cole, Yvonne, Shelly, to Dr. Wasserman) is so incredibly friendly,  personable, and easy to get along with. That's just from a personal level, let alone how many times my back has been worked magic on. I have moderate scoliosis and loving my Beach Body workouts with Shaun T just isn't a good combination but Shelly and Dr. Wasserman have both gotten my back in great shape and pretty quickly (as quickly as they can). Definitely recommend. They've also been expanding their practice so you never know what magic they can do!

I love this store .... I literally tripled my Philadelphia Eagles gear with absolutely adorable tees.  My boyfriend has found several shirts and hats that he loves and I LOVE coming here to get tees of my favorite team.  As a girl, it's difficult to find sports gear that's flattering and feminine but Just Sports always has a huge stock of a big variety of teams .... that's also key.  THEY DO NOT JUST SELL AZ TEAMS!! That's so exciting to me! As an out-of-stater, all of my teams are from PA and I'm thrilled to find a store that carries a nice chunk of memorabilia and clothing.  Yes, last week when I was in there, a good 25% of the store was dedicated to the Coyotes White-Out theme but let's be honest, it was their first time to the Western Championships so I can fully understand.  Staff is nice and the store is well organized.  I love having an in-person option and not having to order everything online anymore.

No no no. My hubs and I tried Hot Wok Feng after getting a menu on our door and never again. First off, it took an hour and a half to get our food ... On a Tuesday .... Ordering at  7 pm. Come on. Every other Chinese restaurant  in the area has it to us within 25-35 minutes. So we got the steamed dumplings, general tso's chicken, and chicken lo mein. Lo mein was greasy, general tso's was underwhelming, and the dumplings were literally inedible. No thanks. Once was enough for us.

Happy hour prices = AMAZING.  I can't find $2.50 blue moon anywhere!  The food smelled delicious (but I can't comment anymore on it since I did not eat anything) but the happy hour prices were fantastic (includes both food and drinks) and it doesn't get too crowded.  Small eating area and even smaller parking lot.  You'll have some trouble finding parking but there are shopping centers on either side so you may just need to walk a bit.  PLUS - when you check in on Yelp, you'll get a free dessert!

I dunno what it is .... maybe it's the fact they're SO over-priced or maybe it's the fact they are so over-priced and the food isn't better than Famous Dave's.  There are DEFINITELY better BBQ/steak options for the same or cheaper prices.  I currently live at the condos at Westgate but once I'm not living there anymore, I don't see myself ever coming back.  It's just not worth the money..... unless you're there for staff eye candy.

Maybe I'm just too old for this place but as a 30 year old, I felt like an outsider.  Everyone there seemed to be between 18-22, which to me, seems strange at a bar in downtown Phoenix.  I would have expected feeling that way on Mill Ave! Not that I go to Mill Ave ;) but seriously.  I was with a group of people ranging from 26 to 35 and we all felt extremely old and out of place.  It's a young, hipster place where there's only one beer on draft (it was some vanilla Hefeweizen.... I never heard of Hefeweizen with vanilla and I think there's a very good reason) and nothing good in bottles either (budweiser, miller high life, PBR, schlitz, etc).  How couldn't I find even a Bud Lite or Miller Light?!?!? We stayed for about 10 minutes before calling it a night.

Ehh it's nothing fantastic.  The staff is always pretty nice and service is fine but the food could definitely be better or have better prices.  We've gone a few times just because it's so convenient to our house but it doesn't really get any better and never completely satisfied.  Our last was on an event day, which made the experience worse because prices were higher, menu was limited and we still weren't that thrilled with our food choices

I went here for the first time for a work happy hour and it was pretty decent.  As someone that's not a huge partier anymore, I would recommend getting there closer to happy hour time but as someone who loves a crowded bar scene, it's a great option for late night as it got packed around 8 p.m.  Typical Mexican food options.  There's an awesome HUGE outdoor section that I'm excited to take advantage of in the non-115 degree weather!  There are private cabanas that you can rent (I think it's $250 to rent them) with a TV and a server.  Service is usually pretty good - plenty of staff on a Friday night

I will never go back to standard airport parking.  Blue Sky Airport was a fantastic option (unless you're literally running to make your flight ..... it is a little tucked away off-site) and SO MUCH cheaper than on-site parking, especially when it seems you can always get $2 off covered or uncovered.  First off, there is an employee waiting at the machine where you get your ticket who radios someone else in the van.  By the time I put my car in park, there was a van waiting to take me to the airport and straight to my terminal.  No waiting for anyone else which can definitely add to your total wait time.  On the ride back to my car, there was a van pulling up as we left the baggage claim and, once again, no waiting for others (ie - to get a full van) before heading back to the parking lot.  Quick and easy payment and make sure you get your frequent parker card - 7 days parking gets you 1 day free!

I would like to start off that the two stars does not reflect their food .... their food is actually 4 stars. However (and it's a big however), out of the last 10 times my husband and I have tried to order from Sidewinders, we had to cancel our order or leave it incomplete online.  Why you ask?  Somehow, a sandwich place is consistently out of white bread.  I literally can't understand it.  That's like going into Subway and they are out of their Italian bread.  It just doesn't make sense.  It's not just their white bread (although that's the most frustrating because that has caused 100% of our canceled orders since my husband won't eat wheat) but 2 of the 4 times we actually have placed orders, they were out of something else.  Once, they were out of the corn nuggets... I accepted and understood that.  The second time, they were out of croissants.  Once again, I accepted and slightly understood that.  That last 6 times we went to order and they're out of white bread?  I can't accept that. It's gotten to the point where I will give my husband two options for delivery (usually between Sidewinders and Chinese food) and while we want to order from Sidewinders, it's not worth calling for the high likelihood they are out of the most popular bread order.

This has become one of our favorite local hangouts. Great happy hour prices, everything I've tried tastes good (quesadillas, burger, chicken fingers, fries), and OFF TRACK BETTING!!! My fiancé and I love to grab a group of friends and take over their pool table area and just spend hours there. Staff is friendly and service is fast. Love it!

I went here for lunch with a co-worker after trying to find someplace new.  It's a nice little breakfast & lunch diner.  Food and service was good and the prices are very affordable. Our waiter was very on top of our drinks when they would get low and checked in just the right amount of times.  Good find in a large shopping center :)

Everything tastes delicious, I can't deny this.  It's expensive for a lunch though .... I don't think I have left without spending at least $12-15 but I guess it's to be expected in Scottsdale Quarter! I've always gone during weekday lunch and it never seems overly busy ---- good service.  If you go at a busier time, I would recommend a reservation as there are only about 20-25 tables inside but they have a nice outdoor patio as well.

we made reservations for my 30th birthday celebration and we couldn't have gotten better service and food.  We were welcomed and seated right away and our server was absolutely fantastic. He was attentive and helpful with his favorites of meal and wine recommendations.  My parents, brother, and fiancee were all there, chose different meals and appetizers, and couldn't have been happier.  The steak literally melted in your mouth and every bite that I put into my mouth was delicious.  It's expensive, definitely expensive .... but for a special occasion? Worth every penny.

"I have no idea what I'm doing right now".... The exact sentence an extremely long line of people waiting want to hear from one of two employees working at 4:36 pm when the location closes at 5:00 pm. No wonder everyone in front of me has a frown and looks to be in a bad mood.

There's a very good reason we had a 25 minute wait on a Saturday afternoon..... Food is phenomenal!! My fiancé and I went with another married couple and we were all just so happy with everything that we ordered. I ordered the veggie omelet with feta cheese... NOM NOM NOM. Literally just melted in my mouth. Delicious food for reasonable prices. We are now an easy bike ride and I see Butters being a normal spot for lazy weekends :)

I would like to mention first, this could have EASILY been a three- or four-star review.  My bf and I went on the Friday before Halloween, which was 80s night and I liked the live music; HOWEVER, our server never put in our dinner and we were on a tight time-frame to get to the Louis CK show down the street.  I loved the atmosphere of the place.  The menu was extremely selective, which kinda sucked but I can't even say whether or not the food was any good because we never got it :\  Nice beer selection though

For someone artistically challenged, I felt like Picasso over here :) The staff really walks you through step-by-step and makes the painting WAY more manageable than you would ever first expect.  The first alcoholic beverage free doesn't hurt either :) My funky wine bottle painting is hung proudly above our wine rack AND I won a free painting night while there!! Friends and I will be going back for their bottle painting night .... without instruction so let's see if I'm as successful as the first night :)

The owners of Yellowtail Sushi are extremely sweet; my bf and I went on a Sunday and surprisingly it was dead.  We really weren't sure why but it's a sin they do not get more business.  The food was delicious, the atmosphere was cozy, prices are right in line, and (most importantly) happy hour specials ALL-DAY Sunday through Thursday.  I highly recommend Yellowtail Sushi if you are aching for some tasty food!

I'm making sure to write this review the day after going so my annoyance has gone down a little. So I've been here twice. Once to eat in the middle of the day and then last night for drinks. Four of us got there around 9 pm so really not late or very crowded yet. We went straight to the bar to order some drinks and play shuffleboard. Getting a refill on said drink order turned out to be impossible. THREE bartenders for a really not busy bar (maybe 20 people) and I had all three either look directly at me (I know because we were the only ones on that side of the bar) and turn away OR walk towards our side of the bar and then completely turn around to go to another patron (we had that happen twice ... They literally walked over to our end of the bar, then turned around towards the other side of the bar where there was more people ... I guess their money is better than ours?). I was standing with hands on an empty pint glass looking at someone to help for the majority of the night. I had to interrupt one bartender flirting with two guys after about five minutes because her back wasn't turning around to look at her other customers. Apparently you better not be a girl and if you're a guy, take off your wedding rings, because unless you're flirting with them, they won't give you the time of day.

I had the absolute worst experience here.  It wasn't the specific doctor (he was just fine and nice) and the location is beautiful .... but the medical assistant(s) for Dr. Syal either have no sense of patient need or have their heads up their asses.  I have several examples to show this but here's the back story.  I suffered a concussion and seeing a neurologist was one of the final steps because the intense headaches weren't going away.  I don't mean, pop an OTC medicine and I'm fine.  I needed prescription painkillers to even somewhat reduce the pain.  So here we go:  Example 1: I saw the doctor on a Wednesday afternoon.  He gave me two prescriptions - one migraine medicine and one narcotic painkiller if that first prescription did not work.  He asked his medical assistant to call it in for me so I gave her the pharmacy name and location.  Was it called in that day? No.  Was it called in first thing in the morning? No.  Was it called in after I called around 11 am the next day? Yes.  I had to call the doctor to REMIND HER to call in my pain medicine.  Thanks dear, the last 24 hours, I had no medicine and nothing to help my headaches better.  Example 2: The migraine medicine was rejected by my insurance because I had already had the maximum amount filled from an earlier primary care physician appt.  The pharmacist was so apologetic and told me she would call the doctor that morning (Thursday) to try to file an exception with my insurance company.  Did I hear back from the doctor that day? No.  Did I hear back from her within a couple of days? No.  Did she finally call me back after I called the following week to follow up on the exception? Yes. Then she had the audacity to tell me it would take another 72 hours before hearing back.  Well, if you had called the week before, it wouldn't have been another 72 hours.  Mind you, I'm still waiting and it's been about 3 weeks since this happened.  Example 3:  The doctor wanted me to have a brain MRI done so I was waiting to hear from the imaging center to schedule an appointment.  When I didn't hear back for a few days, I finally called the neurologist.  The MRI authorization was never released.  Are you kidding me? They released it after I called and got a call from the imaging center the same day.    Example 4:  I finally got the brain MRI completed so I called the neurologist for the results.  They told me they would only call if something was wrong.  Okay, we may have different opinions here but I am the type if a test is done, I want to know the results, whether they're good or bad.  Don't make me sit on my thumbs for a week and just have to assume it's okay.  God forbid my results fell through the cracks and there was actually something wrong and I'm just assuming everything is fine.  It's a brain MRI.  I'd like to know 100% that nothing is wrong but apparently their time is more valuable than their patients' peace of mind.  Example 5: Since I didn't hear back about the MRI on Tuesday (it is Thursday) like I was supposed to, I called around 9:30-10:00 am and was told the medical assistant was away from her desk.  It is 4:30 pm and she never called back, although she had enough time to....  Example 6: Deny a prescription refill for me.  Go back to Example 2 regarding the fact I was supposed to have that first prescription filled and never got it.  Now, they're denying a refill of the only prescription they gave me.  I'm not really sure I need any more examples.  This is a doctors office.  This isn't a restaurant with a bad server or the food wasn't great.  A doctors office should NOT have this many complaints.  Plus, this is a specialist office.  It's for patients that a primary care physician cannot help them with their neurological issue.  Shouldn't they be a little more concerned for their patients' well-being?  To add fuel to the fire, examples 5 & 6 occurred on the Thursday before New Years and they were closed Friday- Monday.  It would have been nice if they had the decency to return their calls before their four-day weekend.  I finally called my health provider after examples 5 & 6 to have me referred to another neurologist because I can't take medical assistants having their heads up their asses and being completely incompetent

I found heaven in the middle of Scottsdale .... I've had cupcakes and cake bites and every bite is DELICIOUS!!! I will be blaming a co-worker when I start gaining weight because we come every Friday to get our fix.  I love the interior of the shop ... and you just walk in and smell the amazing aromas.  I'm drooling just thinking about it.

Definitely not impressed with this place ..... the food is terrible for the prices.  The drinks were tasty but $10/margarita gets old pretty quickly.  Four of us went for dinner and drinks on a Saturday evening, before it got busy.  We went into the main bar area and actually had to move before we got our food because there were about 20 flies just attacking our area -- it was pretty disgusting thinking that we were going to try to eat there.  We moved into the main restaurant where we were definitely happier - lower music so we could actually hear each other at dinner and no flies but the food was not good.  We started with the steak kabob appetizer and it was literally inedible - absolutely disgusting and way too rubbery.  None of us were impressed with our meals and we ended up leaving after dinner to go to TGI Fridays so we could actually eat

Hubs and I decided to go outside our bubble for dinner and saw Bourbon Jacks. High rating with a ton of reviews so why not? The bartenders were friendly and the food was delicious. Do not skip the spicy Mac n cheese bites. Omg so good! The fried pickles were good but massive portion - def not a one-person app! My sandwich was so-so (Arizona Cuban) and the sweet potato fries were worth the extra dollar. They have a huge selection of Mule drinks for reasonable prices and a two page menu of Bourbon (shocking? Nah!).   The odd thing was we were there around 6:30 pm and a customer must have been doing some serious day drinking. She was wasted and the staff handled it very professionally despite the scene she was trying to make. I added some pictures of her just because she was being crazy taking pictures of the staff. Trust me - the staff handled the situation correctly and appropriately.

It took me about 18 months of living in Arizona to stumble on this and it was by pure accident.  This place is DELICIOUS!  Think of a chipotle/subway-esque place but for Italian food.  You can choose between an Italian-style "burrito" (the Pellini), pasta bowl, or salad.  I got the pasta bowl and not only was it amazingly good, there was enough for two meals so I got to enjoy it all over again the next day.  Everything was fresh and tasty and I can't say anything bad about this place.  So many different options for an extremely reasonable price.  You decide between the three styles and then choose your meats, sauce, and extras.  Once my b/f and I move to Scottsdale, we'll be making many more trips here and I raved about it to several of my friends to try out :)  They had already beaten me to the punch and I was upset they hadn't told me about this place earlier!!

So. Well. The service was okay unless you actually wanted to receive all of the items that you ordered. The server missed my entree and missed my husbands drink refill. And then our appetizers and my husband's entree all came out at the same time. Mine just was never put into the system. At least we didn't get charged for the missing items so that's a plus, right?

I love these outlets..... maybe it's because I'm only walking distance to them! I've been to several other outlet malls and I think the construction and layout of these outlets are extremely cool and interesting.  You sort of feel that you're in an indoor mall but since it's Arizona and it never gets cold, you're still outdoors.  I don't know how to really explain it but it's different than all other outlet malls I've been to.  Cute little seating areas are there around fire pits and PLENTY of parking, especially since Westgate is right across the street which basically triples the amount of available parking.  Since these were just finished in November 2012, everything is still extremely new and beautiful

i love love LOVE the revolving sushi concept ..... it's a small and very casual spot - good for lunch and dinner.  The chefs are definitely on top of making sure items do not just stick around for hours at a time .... I noticed that there are stickers on each lid, which must signify what time they put it out and when to take it off the conveyor.  When dealing with sushi, that's HUGE!!! Everything tasted delicious and they will take special requests :) Amazing prices --- you really can't beat a $1.50 roll!!!

This place is a ZOO!!!!!!!!!! I'm kind of happy I waited so long after it opened because although it's calmed down greatly, it's still very hectic! Two lines for customers, six registers, everyone yelling, orders being called over a microphone .... it's an interesting experience your first time but those employees have this down pact!  Everything came out tasting fantastic and I was extremely satisfied :)  I had their regular hotdog with everything on it, tried a jumbo chili dog, and shared their cheese fries :)

Schaffer's is a stock store so if you're a small size, prepare to spend all your money on the alterations. I was so incredibly lucky and found a discontinued Maggie Sottero gown (originally $1700) on sale for $99. Add more luck when it was a size 8 and fit my body very well. It's $185 to hem and $185 to bustle which they admit can be high compared to other tailors, but for the quality and price of my dress, I went with them for the tailoring. The entire staff is so professional, from the reception desk to the sales staff to the seamstress. Excellent work.

My husband and I had an inspection done on our house and had some minor tweaks needed with some plumbing work.  We contacted about 7 plumbers and by far, Lawson Family Plumbing had the best prices.  We had them out to get a formal quote and the serviceman was awesome and said he had availability to make the corrections while he was there without needing to schedule a separate appointment (yay!).  One of the repairs that we needed involved the lint duct from our dryer so when our dryer didn't work a few days later, I obviously reached out.  Jeff not only responded back to me quickly, he responded back on a Saturday and offered to research the problem for me (to ensure it wasn't due to the lint duct service).  In short, it had nothing to do with the work his staff performed but he spent the time to research the problem, which I felt was above and beyond as I feel most people would have just waved off my concern.

It's so funny .... when Yelp sees that you've checked into a place on multiple occasions, it asks "what keeps you coming back?" ... oh I will tell you what keeps us coming back! Their $5 margarita happy hours!!!!!  They have $5 until 5 pm every day ($5 margaritas or pitchers of beer), then they have Taco Tuesday (which then includes an array of $2 tacos) .... but man, the margaritas are delicious ... the tacos are delicious .... THAT'S what keeps me coming back :)

a large group of us went for a birthday dinner on a Friday night .... you would think between the number of people (12) and the time of day/week (Friday at 6 pm), the service would be horrible or food lousy or SOMETHING but that wasn't the case at all!! The service was great and the food was amazing .... I had the cheeseburger sliders and tastes of the chili tots.  So good!! Plus, their happy hour specials are really great too! I highly recommend :)

my two girlfriends and I came here on a whim after our first choice was closed (why we didn't check Yelp hours until AFTER we got there, I just don't know).  It was a great find! They make individual pizzas to your order and everything tastes great and fresh! It's a little more expensive than your typical chain pizza place but since everything is made to order, worth it.

I was just introduced to Firehouse Subs and having been a fan of Potbellys and Subway, figured it would be essentially the same thing ..... WRONG.  I had their Turkey Verde sandwich and it was DELICIOUS.  For under 500 calories, I assumed I would still be hungry after and WRONG again.  I walked out completely stuffed.  Fresh ingredients, fast service, and helpful staff.  Next time someone wants to go to Subway or Potbelly's, I'll be taking them here instead :)

Regina was my lifesaver during my engagement. I went from a "I can do this myself" bride to an "if I see one more Pinterest board or idea, I'm going to scream" bride. I was originally assigned to another lead planner..... who ended up leaving the wedding planning/event planning business about halfway through. Regina picked up midway and it was like she had planned everything from the beginning --- absolutely seamless transition. She was so responsive and so helpful with bouncing ideas off of. I think having someone helping saved my relationship ;) even before the day-of, I was recommending her to anyone who would listen and now that the wedding is over, I can't imagine having done it without her. Everything was flawless day of and she was there anytime I needed her (like when my dad stepped on my dress.... twice and broke the bustle.... twice haha).

I love this place haha .... what a refreshing sight from all the super expensive places on the Las Vegas Strip.  They completely play up the old, divey casino and know how to do it! Where else can you play 10-cup beer pong and buy two pitchers of domestics for $23.50 (which was about 1 1/2 games of that 10-cup beer pong!!) .... it's smoky, divey, dirty, trashy and AWESOME.  Trust me when I say "this ain't no Bellagio" but that's what you're going there for.  It's a bunch of younger 20-somethings getting drunk - just make sure you know that's what you're walking into (come on now, there's a tattoo shop connected!!) and you'll be sure to have an absolute blast!!

love me some Fired Pie.  So they took over Pellini's spot, which I was extremely upset when I found out they closed.  Fired Pie keeps the layout of Pellini's, which is basically a Chipotle-type assembly line but for pizza and salad :) my coworker and I tried it out one day and was instantly hooked.  I've tried both the pizza and salad and both were delicious! They have a fixed price for pizza and a fixed price for salad, no matter if you choose the custom or the house recipe, which is really nice considering most pizza places charge you about $0.50 to $1.25 for toppings!

I really wish I didn't have to give Kaard zero stars, but I have to. While he was responsive before and up to the wedding (which thankfully he showed up to), I have not heard a word from him since July 28th. At that time, he had been fully paid, song choices provided, and had indicated my husband and I would have all of our footage by the end of the week. Note that our contract had mentioned we would have at least our raw footage within 30 days of the event (05/10/2014), which we had not received, but since I had been promised all of our edited footage before the end of the week, I didn't mind. Today is September 5 and I have tried emailing Kaard six times, along with three phone calls, since that last email and he will not respond. I have no choice but to give him zero stars and warn other brides to hire someone else. As of now, we are out the full payment and we do not have any video footage of our wedding.  Married since 05/10/2014

Warning: If you're from Maryland, you will get homesick for blue crabs.  Angry Crab is expensive, that's without saying, but it's WORTH IT.  Seafood is flown in daily and you order it by the pound.  Get ready to get dirty because there are no utensils ... you're digging in manually!  I can't say one negative thing about Angry Crab .... reminded me of all the crab feasts back in Baltimore :)

I've only recently discovered Kneaders for lunch and it was delicious! I somehow walked by the pastries (I'm still amazed that I was able to) but managed to grab a sample of a cherry pastry next to the cashier :) I ordered their Turkey Avocado on sourdough .... mmmmmmm.  They certainly don't skimp on portions so their half sandwich is definitely enough for me!

Super cute location in Gilbert (newly open).  I had never been to a Petersons but I loved the 50s theme and the ice cream was delicious.  Be prepared to take your ice cream to go if it's a Friday night ... there is limited seating and the town gets BUSY.
