Huge fan of Dr. Steve and the whole team at Kai Zen.  Love that they offer so many services and provide great resources as well.  I always feel so much better after visiting them...I have more energy, more balance and more focus!  Absolutely recommend Kai Zen!

Awful.  Service was pretty slow (although server was super nice once he was able to give us some attention).  Ordered black bean burger that was a lukewarm garden burger patty topped off with a black hair in the fries.  Won't be back...ever.

Seems silly but when you have a shoe issue, getting a fast, quality and reasonably fix borders on necessity (note to self:  carry some form of shoe in car for such instances).  I called Cobbler's Den at 9am and was back in my office with new heel tips by 935am.  Really awesome!  Many thanks for the great service!

Super quick service (came out within 2 hours of my calling), did a great job replacing the sad-Mac-cracked glass on my 5s (under 20 mins) and were very reasonable from a cost stand-point.  A thumbs up from me!

Love, love, love Kale and Clover!  Delightful spot with the best black bean and quinoa tacos.  I always leave feeling like I given my body some delicious and nutritious food!
