This subway is ALWAYS stingy. It doesn't matter who is making the sandwiches there is always more bread than meat cheese and veggies. I do not recommend ever going to this subway. My sandwich sucks everytime

I love this salon. It's quite and cute. The owner and nail tech is the best nail tech I've ever had or been to. She's so caring and sweet. I also love the hairdressers. Meagen is the best cosmetologist ever! I've never had a bad experience at this salon and I will continue to go back because I like the environment because its down to earth and I feel comfortable there

This salon is so personal I love it. It's very small and quiet and a great place to receive a hair service or nail service. The environment is very relaxed and calm. The owner and nail tech Jennifer is a very caring person and AMAZING nail tech. I've never been disappointed when she does my nails or toes. And the hair stylists are just the sweetest thing. I definitely recommend this place To someone who wants quality service and also a personal experience. It's not a walk in walk out place like great clips and the nail techs won't yell or be mean to you like at the Vietnamese nail shops. This place is awesome

This is my favorite hungry howie's location. Because of their $5 large 1 topping pizza, it definitely makes it the one with the best deals. They're always friendly when I go in there and if you're a regular they remember you. I recommend this place to anyone in Tempe even if they don't drive to you.

This is my favorite smoke shop. They have the best deals and the best products. Their pieces are so well blown and there are so many different designs and shapes and colors. The employees are Awesome too. Always helpful and chill. They're also open until 2 am on weekends which is real convenient. 12 on weekdays I believe. Check this place out you won't regret it.

This place is absolutely AMAZING! I haven't been able to find many places with eggs Benedict and I found many different kinds here and it was amazing. I will for sure be going back there. I recommend this place because the food and service was pretty fantastic and thinking about it makes me want some now :)

This place is absolutely fantastic, I've been there so many times and every time the food is served quickly and the food is amazing. They have such a great variety on food and drinks. There's 52 beers on tap and idk if ill ever get to to trying them all when the time comes. I love the environment, sports, great music and awesome employees and managers. I definitely recommend trying this place.

I have had my eyelash extensions done twice by Alex and I will never go to anyone else. Not only does she do a fantastic job making the eyelashes look realistic, she's very gentle with the application. In fact, so gentle I fell asleep the first time and tried not to fall asleep the second time. Alex takes pride in her work and cares about her clients. I would recommend her to anyone and have referred several friends and family members to her.
