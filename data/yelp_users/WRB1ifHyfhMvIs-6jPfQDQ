I have a smaller dog, and I'm upset that my dog got attacked by a bigger dog. The park is not safe at all for smaller dogs. I would like if there was a smaller area in the lake section for smaller dogs.  -10 year old dog owner

The service here is phenomenal. The entire staff makes you feel like you're a part of their family. I recommend you make your way here. I've been 5 times in the last 2 weeks.  thank you for providing the best service in the Gilbert area. Furthermore the Pizza is AMAZING!!! You can't find pizza this good unless you're in Brooklyn!

Well I've been to this place once and it was over a year ago. The place was very buys and the service was ok. I loved the atmosphere and they had Karaoke that night also. However my one question is this... Why does the Owner not reply to the bad reviews? This is their chance to answer the questions why only respond to good reviews? That worries me.   ** Had to update the review** I called The Watershed just now to check and see if they were going to be playing the game tonight, and the person who answered the phone was very professional and helpful. I love when people have great customer service skills over the phone. Thats a huge plus... now let's hope that service is the same in person.
