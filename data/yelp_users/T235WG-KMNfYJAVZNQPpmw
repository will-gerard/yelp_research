This store is totally unorganized. I walked in around 10:30 am to a short line. My order was taken yet I still waited for what seemed like forever. I ordered a panini and a Frap. Sandwich was out rather quick however, it took them yet another 10 mins (I'm being generous) to get my drink to me. There were not that many people in front of me yet, there were at least 7 drinks sitting on the counter with no identified patron to match them up with. While I waited for my beverage, I watched the counter worker continue to place food and beverages on an extremely dirty counter (no bueno). The lack of attention and service leave me with no choice but to rate them a 2. Additionally, the taste of my beverage was absolutely horrible. I've been purchasing the same drink for years (Salted Caramel Frap = Toffee Nut Mocha Frap when not in season on the menu); its not that hard to make since it is a menu item and there is a recipe for it. I was quite disappointed and do not plan on ever going back.

The service here is absolutely horrible. Just horrible! The drive-thru wraps around the back of the building and into a medical facility parking lot (definitely not the best of situations and could absolutely be a nightmare). The drive-thru baristas come across as rude and not very customer friendly. I've been inside several times and each time the counter baristas are also less than customer oriented. Maybe its something in the water in that area. The ONLY reason why I tend to stop at this facility is because it is almost one of the last Starbucks options when driving up to Flagstaff.

I typically go here for a breakfast burrito or chicken rolled tacos (taquitos). Based on the location of this particular Los, they are often busy and the tables aren't always clean. Though I don't sit and eat often, when I do, I'd prefer a clean table (wiped with a cleansing agent and not a rag from the sink in the back).

No one should EVER be able to sit in the drive-thru and write a review on Yelp while waiting for their order! There is no GOOD reason why it's taking this long. My goodness! And don't just throw my food and money at me! And these cold ass fries! Im so glad I dont eat this bs any more! Holy cow!

Quick service. Went in to purchase a macbook for my daughter; was literally in and out in 15 mins (and that was WITH my one million questions and the fact that they were seriously busy).  The store is often busy but, they do make an honest effort to service everyone....at least that has been my experience.

I LOVE salads and find that the variety here is better than Paradise Bakery. Not only that, I feel that I get what I pay here. Of late, I've been stopping by WFBC in North Scottsdale and ordering a petite Wildflower Salad (it fills me up and it's absolutely delicious).  Today I ordered one for pickup at Chandler Mall and, as an added bonus, a slice of Ginger Biscotti Cheesecake (never had it but looks devine). Upon getting home I was rather disappointed to find that my cheesecake was haphazardly thrown into it's package and in pieces....I can't tell if I got the whole slice or half. I immediately called the manager when I got home, she was very apologetic and offered a gift card for the mishap (I'll be picking that up this weekend ).  I'm always satisfied with the service I receive from WFBC and the quality of their food. Though this incident was disappointing (I was looking forward to devouring that cheesecake), my salad is absolutely wonderful!   I will continue to patronize WFBC.

Though I generally go for a nice bowl/cup of oatmeal, today I opted to try something new and I'm sure glad I did. I tried the Slow-Roasted Tomato, Feta, and Egg Sandwich....IT WAS EVERYTHING! The feta gave it a real special taste, the bread was perfect, and it wasn't overly buttered.   I called my order in and it was promptly ready to go by the time I walked through the doors. The staff at this location are always friendly and courteous. I especially appreciate the fact that someone now confirms that my order is correct and all items are accounted for; there have been several instances where key elements were missing (i.e.; jam for my toast, utensils to eat with, no salad dressing, or not enough, for my salad...not sure exactly how that happened, but ok).  I haven't had one bad food item yet! The food is plentiful. I never feel like I overpaid. The customer facing experience is always pleasant. I'm always satisfied. And, it's not junk-food.  I WildCompany!  p.s. I hope Mr. Basile will consider a reward program of sorts; I'd be on a role and working free entree numero veintidos or something like that. Lol

Not worth the money; $115 for 4 people and that doesn't include the tip! It was a zoo. We were seated by a table of about 7, 3 were children. I was amazed at how the parents allowed their children to run around, as if it were a playground, absolutely ridiculous!   For the amount of money we paid, I was expecting to had received more bang for my buck. The ONLY positive thing was the super great service from our server.   Definitely wont be returning.

Mr. B and I LOVE LOVE LOVE pizza! Good pizza that is. If it were up to us, we'd have pizza at least 5 out of the 7 nights of the week. The building setting is a house turned into an eating establishment. The service was good and the food was GREAT! In reality, 2 people can share a pizza and large salad and be good. Mr. B and are selfish and greedy so, sharing was not an option on the pizza situation; we did share the salad. The bill was a little hefty for 2 pizzas, a large salad and 3 glasses of vino but, you can't put a price on good food and service. The servers were extremely attentive, which was a huge plus. We will definitely be back for date night. Definitely a must try if you're in the area.

Mr. B and I stayed here over the weekend to celebrate is 21st Burt-day again (hee hee). We had such a blast! The 50's deco is absolutely gorgeous. I opted for their 10th Anniversary Special which included a room upgrade for a measly $10 (score), 2 complimentary drinks, and a $10 resort credit to use as we pleased. (Yes, we used it at the bar!). Upon arrival the staff was extremely pleasant. From the valets when we drove up to the guy who checked us in. Nothing but smiles and courteous service. 5 stars for the service.  Our room, was so awesome! We had a studio room that was the perfect size. The tub in the center of the room was the best feature (I've asked for one just like it at home), which we THOROUGHLY enjoyed. The room accommodations were quite spacious. If you have the option, select an upgrade.   For a Sunday the pool was full but not overly packed, which we definitely appreciated. We were able to grab two chairs close to the pool steps and still take a dip without feeling crowded. The service at the pool was good as well. We were going out to dinner, which we didn't want to spoil, so we opted for chips with queso, salsa and guacamole. Surprisingly, the guac was very tasty. It wreaked of freshness and the right amount of everything that makes a good guac (5 stars ZuZu!). The salsa was decent, could've used a tad bit of salt, but it was devoured all the same. The queso was great as well. It had a mixture of black olives, and either green chiles or jalapenos (they weren't spicy so, we couldn't tell). Nonetheless it was still good. I enjoyed 2 Blackberry Mules (damn tasty) while Mr. B. had a Cadillac Rita (their house name I'm unsure at the moment) and one of their specialty drinks of the day. So, 4 drinks and an appetizer cost me all of $17 (remember, I had 2 comp drinks and a $10 resort credit. SCORE!). 5 Stars for the food and beverage hook-up.  The overall experience of the hotel was great! It was clean, beautiful and the staff was courteous and friendly, which made us feel very welcome. We will DEFINITELY come back for another stay-cation. Perhaps we'll try out the Tower (insert double air fist here).

We've eaten here dozens of times, but I'm so disappointed with this evening's dinner selection. My daughter and I decided to share an order of shrimp fried rice and crab rangoons. The rice was salty and greasy (reminded me of a cheesy Ma & Pop Chinese restaurant in East Oakland), while the rangoons were just ok.   Being part of the PF Chang's chain of restaurant's, my expectations are higher than the norm; we don't have meal issues at PF Chang's.  This is the 2nd time eating at this particular location and I've been less than satisfied with my meal. Perhaps Pei Wei is not the restaurant for me, which is sad being as we love PF Chang's and Pei Wei is a little easier on the bankroll.

We booked a stay-cation here for the recent 4th of July weekend and we are certainly glad we did. We rented a casita right next door to the water park; we also had a pool right outside out suite which was really nice. Friday and Saturday nights they played movies by the poolside in the water park. Families laid out on lawn chairs and wadded in the pool while enjoying Despicable Me and Despicable Me 2.  The rooms were just ok. For a casita, I'd expect a small stove of sorts being that you're given a kitchen area with full size fridge, sink and microwave. Our small couch was broken, but my nephew found a creative way to sleep on it anyway. My daughter said the sofa bed wasn't all too bad. My accommodations upstairs lent a huge king size bed all to my lonesome and it was surely nice and comfy.   Parking was awesome; there are 3 spaces under the casitas and you can park on the street in front of your door.  The staff was fairly pleasant; except for the kids that work the water park (they acted like they didn't want to work).   Calling reservations is useless; you're better off booking online and calling the front desk with any resort specific questions. Book with AAA if at all possible. Download the Hilton app which allows you to check in online and choose your own room. Fantastic! No long checkin lines.  Admission to the water park is included in your stay, regardless the type of room. Regular hotel room gets 4. 1-bd casita gets 6 and a 2-bd casita gets 8. Anything over that and they are supposedly $30 per wristband.   I'd recommend. We're definitely going back!

I recently took a decorating class at Sweets Unlimited and had so much fun!  The owner and her staff are kind, friendly, and knowledgeable.  During the two hour class we decorated 6 cupcakes and 6 cookies each.  They provided all the fixings and a clean working environment to learn in. Although I initially took the class to learn, I was pleasantly surprised when I finally tasted the cupcakes.  They were really tasty.  The chocolate was moist and light.  The vanilla was also very good.  The instructor who taught the class was a recent Chef Pastry graduate and she was really patient.  Although she was quick, she was also thorough to ensure that no student was left behind.  That means a lot to the inexperienced decorator.  Another staff member also walked around and assisted the 10 students in attendance.  Once class was over we had a light lunch which consisted of wraps and salad.  Eva makes a really good chicken-salad wrap!  Family recipe....superb!  What I appreciated most was that they were not afraid to share their knowledge.  I can't wait for them to offer additional classes.  I will upload pictures of my decorated cupcakes and cookies tomorrow.  Thank you Sweets Unlimited for opening up your doors!!!   UPDATE 8.28.11: I just uploaded my pictures from the class.  I thought I had a close-up of the Spider-Web cupcake however, I guess I didn't take one =(  You can see it in the box of finished cupcakes.    Enjoy!

Dakota (he's a guy) was awesome! My nephew and I were waited on immediately upon sitting down (after a brief 10 min wait for a table). Our food was brought out promptly AND my fries were fresh and hot! The manager greeted us after our meal to ensure all was well. My Thorny Señorita Rita was GRRREEATT as well.   No complaints from this girl about this place.

I've been to this Z'Tejas a few times. I typically enjoy their catfish but today I found it rather bland and tasteless. The Chambord Margarita I had was awfully watery; they are usually quite tasty (this was good, but not great). Now, my Tejas Mule was absolutely delish! The service was pretty decent as well. 4 stars  There'a ALWAYS interesting sites at the Scottsdale Z'Tejas.  Always!

I didn't want to do this but....(i'd like to take my 3 stars down to 1)  I had visited Sunday and experienced DECENT service. So I decided to try HH to see what's its all about, nothing fancy. I arrived around 6:30 pm to plenty of space at the bar, so I sat quickly. After being seated for several minutes I was offered the opportunity to order.  Las Vegas Roll, Crunchy Shrimp Roll and a Tokyo Raspberry....Meeeh! Tasted like watery juice.  By 6:50 pm I'm ready to order, but FIRST I must have another drink. I quickly ordered a Yozu Margarita (I think thats what its called) and mom ordered another Benihana Punch.  We then proceeded to order our food. I opted for a bowl of shrimp fried rice and side salad, mom ordered the Sea Bass. After quietly waiting 20 mins with no second  beverage, I made note to one of the bartenders about our drinks. By 7:40 no food and no drinks. I watched 3 people behind the bar make drinks and clean. Where in the heck are my drinks?! When inquiring about the food, we were advised that it was almost done (someone told me that 15 mins ago). Now I'm hungry and thirsty. What makes it bad is that I ordered the drinks TWICE! At this point we're ready to go, so we ask for the food as such. 10 mins later the food arrives...Plated. I THOUGHT I ASKED FOR THIS TO GO! Why is it so difficult to get good service?  Benihana is hit or miss these days. More miss than hit.

I've been under the weather the past few days and it was suggested to try the Pho Gà (Chicken Soup); I was told it would "Bring me Back". The items came neatly packaged allowing me to add as much veggies, noodles and extras as I wanted to my broth. The combo was very flavorful. There was enough for me to eat for dinner last night and lunch today. My children are bringing more home now. This is my first time trying Vietnamese cuisine. There are definitely a few other items on their menu I'd like to try. I'd go back

After coming down with a sinus infection I needed something to fill my belly and make me feel better. The Seafood Pho (I believe P8 on the menu) gave me LIFE! Snow crab, shrimp and scallops (not a big fan of scallops so, I requested extra shrimp instead).  The place was clean and the service was fast, yet friendly. I especially appreciated the fact that the containers were neatly placed on a piece of cardboard in the bottom of my bag. This small detail added stability to my package to assist in avoiding spillage during the car ride home. All of the ingredients were neatly bagged and separated. (5 stars)  The actual Pho was DELICIOUS; though I was expecting a tad bit more shrimp and crab. If I counted correctly, there were all of 5 shrimp, 1/4 of the crab body and 1 inch of crab leg in my container. I had to literally ration the portion out so that I could have a second bowl later.  For the price, I wasn't expecting a lb. of seafood however; it would've been nice to have a decent amount in my bowl to fill my belly. (4 stars)  Overall, I rate them 4.5 and, since you can't give 1/2 stars, I'm rounding up (like the IRS). I would recommend this restaurant. I'll definitely be back.

Thanks to the recommendation from a friend, I'm finally trying the joint.  The server at the bar immediately assisted by taking our order. My desire to want the Mahi Mahi burger prompted her to suggest a burger not on the (quote unquote) regular menu...The Salmon Burger. Fresh dill. House tartar. Fresh spinach. Steak tomatoes. And I substituted the wheat bun for a wheat pita. The parental ordered the Pesto Pizza while the juvenile ordered a Steak Philly.   While waiting for our order, I inquired about wine choices. No Moscato, but the server politely suggested their house Sangria and provided a generous portion for my sampling pleasure. Needless to say, I ordered a glass while we waited (my glass was filled to the rim). Very tasty and recommended.   Additionally, the server was nice enough to throw in some fresh tomatoes and sliced cucumbers. Crisp and refreshing. Everyone enjoyed their meals. We even shared the cucumbers with the barker, which he thoroughly enjoyed as well.  While I can only speak to the service at the Gilbert location, I'd definitely return and recommend Pita Jungle. This place was clean and the servers were very friendly.  Thanks Benerific for the suggestion!

This place is ridiculous! Its sad that I can sit in the drive-thru and write a review. They are horribly slow (and it's Saturday). We arrived at 9:15 am and waited at the speaker for every bit of 4 mins before the barista came on and asked us to wait before she could take our order. At 9:21 am, the order was placed. There were 3 cars in front of us so, my expectation for the line to move smoothly was shot down when we waited another 8 mins before we approached the window and another 2 before they opened the window to take my card and pass me my drink.   Why is it so difficult to provide great customer service? No one should have to sit in a drive-thru from start to finish for 15 mins for ANYTHING! I stepped outside of my box and ordered a drink that I figured they couldn't mess up (Caramel Frap); boy was I wrong. The drink was watery and did not include the extra caramel drizzle that I requested 15 mins prior. The sticker on my cup said extra drizzle so, why was it not included?   I can't say that I'll be back to this location. My time is valuable and won't be spent waiting on a mediocre beverage. If you are in this area (32nd St. & Thomas), buyer beware.

We initially came under the impression that HH was all day on Sundays. Bummer to find out that that is only extended at the Chandler and Scottsdale locations only. Not an issue, therefore my review is not based on that.   Service (5): Danny was awesome and honest. He told us what was good, bad, and iffy. Although I don't know him personally, he appeared very honest and knowledgeable about the menu, which is a huge plus. It is extremely important that servers are familiar with the menu items.  Danny continuously came back to check on us, which was much appreciated.  Environment/Vibe (3): For the location, my expectations were set higher. I would've expected the bar area to have larger t.v.'s; that area (including) outside is larger than most. They definitely could benefit from larger screens; especially when they tend to have games on.  Food (4): We ordered 5 rolls: - Sunshine  - Shrimp Tempura - Shrimp & Lobster - (2) King Crab  All pretty decent. The avocado was fresh (super plus); over ripe avocado is not tasty in sushi.   Drinks (4): My Moscow Mules were decent; sent first one back because the ginger beer was flat. But, replacement and 2nd round were delish. The parental unit ordered  Chambord Margarita; must've been good cuz she had another round.   Overall, everything was decent. Food was a tad bit pricey for not being a standalone establishment (total bill before tip was $135). I may try again as there were other 'non-sushi' items on the menu that caught my eye.

I came to this location because it is extremely close to my house.  There are 2 people working the registers and  CLEARLY one line. I've been standing here for over 7 mins to make a simple return. These cashiers are extremely slow. If you cannot chat with customers and work the register, perhaps you should try one or the other but NOT both!  It's now been another 3 mins and I'm still standing here. There's something seriously wrong with this picture. It shouldn't take 10 mins to process a 3-item return...but it did.  And for the customers who believe that they can stand on either side of the counter to be serviced...inappropriate. There is ONE line clearly marked on the floor, get in it! It should've been obvious with the two people standing behind me. Don't be offended when others, waiting to see how the cashier is going to act, state that they are next. You see other customers gathering in one line...follow suit!  The store was quiet. There were all if seven cars in the parking lot. I should NOT have been in line that long! I'll drive to Chandler before I come back here. This is a joke!   Stay away! Stay very far away!

I'm on Sears battery #3 within a 12 year timeframe . Yes, its the same car. While I don't agree completely with their warranty policy, I haven't had to pay full price for a battery or installation.   I called first to confirm the price of my replacement; $85 credit towards a $140 battery and $20 off installation ($67.80 out the door). I was a little miffed when I walked in because I stood at the counter long enough to hear an entire boring conversation (that wasn't work related) as I stood waiting for someone to come and assist me. I literally had to walk to the office where the two guys were to show face that a customer was waiting (insert rolling eyes here). Once assisted, the service was great. I pulled up at 5:20 pm (it's Thursday) and was out by 6:05 pm.    The guys there were nice and the place was fairly clean (considering it was an auto repair establishment where grease and grime have a party 24 hrs a day 7 days a week).   Thanks Sears for helping me get on my way in a timely manner.

Last week we stopped on a Thursday and got free breakfast entrees. In addition, we ordered a side of fruit. I decided to save the fruit, and held onto it until Friday. I was quite surprised to see mold on the strawberries. Yuck! Fortunately for me, I held onto my receipt and politely took the bad fruit to the establishment where I'd purchased it. Please note, that this is NOT the reason for this poor review. We stopped for breakfast again and sat in the drive-thru line for every bit of 8 mins; though it seemed liked 20.   Why hold up the line for someone's missing waffle fries/tater tots? Why can't they pull to the side and have their meals brought out when ready? Sort of like their nameless neighbor on the East side of the building (eh'em!). There no apologies, no explanation or anything. I find it completely unacceptable to have customers waiting that long; but in the early am commute? Seriously? Who does that? Then, to top it off, we get 15 miles away to find that the key piece to those biscuit chicken bites is no where to be found. No honey! Even after it was confirmed that there was some in the bag. Argh!  The ONLY thing that Chick fil a can get me right now is a strawberry milkshake.

First let me say that this place is hidden yet, very popular amongst the locals; there was plenty of street parking upon arrival but, close to nothing once we left. The venue is reminiscent of a small house that one's grandmother or great-grandmother may have owned. We arrived around 10:20 am and was advised of a 20-30 min wait; more like 45 to an hr. For that I give them 4 stars as they are a but unorganized.  A new restaurant (The Perch) opened a few weeks ago and they share a courtyard with Yoli's which, could be both good and bad. Yoli's is quite small and it appears that the property lines for both restaurants is very awkward; there are a few tables for The Perch that are right next to and surrounding tables for Yoli's Cafe. This might be ok PRIOR to The Perch opening at 11 am but, anytime near that, they have no problem kicking you out. Both restaurants should work together to work this out as it could potentially cause customer service issues.  The food was reasonably priced, I'd return.

Ok, so I haven't written a review in a short while but, this one is worth it!   I love Oregano's. I do! And I haven't been in a while. But today I decided to go because my mother, who just moved here from Louisiana, thinks she's eaten at every restaurant there is since she's been here...she hasn't...so I decided to take her here since it's in walking distance (too cold tonight though). There was a line outside that looked like forever. But, we walked right to the bar and sat down.   New menu! New Options.   I order oldies: Stuffed Mushrooms and Pesto Pizza. The parental unit orders the new Kale salad (I don't do meat products, so I pass. Smelled/looked good though).  Everything was on point! Best of all...my two Top Shelf Cadillac Margaritas! Hand squeezed with homemade Sweet & Sour! Who does that? Not many, that's for sure. 1st one was made with lemon instead of lime. Tasty, real tasty! 2nd....had it made regular (with lime) but with a lemon wedge. Man! Those drinks were on POINT!   Hands down to the manager over there! His menu suggestions were righteous and his rita's were the best I'd had in weeks!  Good food. Excellent service. And hearty portions. A little pricey...$85 dollars later, and worth every penny. But, hey! That's the price you pay for good food AND good service! Right?  I'll definitely be back!

While I do not have a pic to share, the tacos here are the truth!   The Mr. and I decided to try something new last night for Taco Tuesday last night, which landed us at this spot. Located on a busy street, this place serves up some delicious grub.  The service here was great. The young lady at the counter was helpful in menu options and patient with explaining them. It's apparent that it is family owned and operated; something one could appreciate. Small and original. You can tell that its been there forever. The place is old but they keep it clean.   We ordered Carne Asada and Chicken tacos. The meats were very well seasoned on both. Each tortilla was grilled to perfection and filled from edge to edge with meat, onions and cilantro. Everything tasted homemade. The side carrots and jalapeños are pickled in-house and were absolutely delicious! The red salsa was tasty but a little too hot for my tongue; Mr. B. loved it. I prefer the green chile salsa as it added additional flavor to my chicken tacos. We took our order to go and arrived home to food that was still pipping hot (huge plus).  We will definitely come back and try other options. If you're in the area, Tacos Sahuaro is a place you won't be disappointed in.

I've been to BLD for breakfast twice. The prices are fair for the amount of food you get. The breakfast menu has a good variety of options and the place is clean. The wait, however, is questionable. Both times I went on a Sunday and waited 10-20 mins at most for a table. The service could be better. Those who wait on you tend to take your order after you've looked around for them; busy or not, service is critical. The community table gets the worst service in my opinion (will never sit there again).This place is convenient and provides a break after Sunday church service. One day I'll try lunch and dinner, they have a decent menu.

Wanting to try something new, Mr. B. and I stumbled upon this spot. Well, actually it's been on my bookmark list for a while now but that's besides the point.  The service was good. Our waitress was attentive however, it would be great if she would've been more suggestive of the menu items. There are so many awesome options on the menu that it was hard to make a choice. Especially after confirming that we'd never been there before. We waited about 30 mins for a table and opted to walk the perimeter to check out the shops in the area. But, once we were seated and ordered our food, the order came rather promptly and was served hot.  The food was Grreeat! It was in abundance and extremely flavorful. I opted for 2 scrambled eggs (more like 4 but, NOT complaining), potatoes (gotta try), bacon, and sub'd my toast for pecan pancakes ($.99 up charge but damn sure worth it!). Mr. B. had Swedish pancakes with bananas, pecans and some other additions that he felt necessary. Although I don't care for all the extras on my cakes, I found them very tasty (thin, and crisp with the right amount of sweetness).  We didn't mind the wait (we expect it in most places we frequent) and will definitely be back....several times.   A must try!

My children took me to dinner at Federal Pizza across the street so, being in the area, having ice-cream was a must! I opted for the Salted Caramel Lil Freezie (the only exception was, I swapped out the sweet cream ice-cream for butter pecan). OH EM GEE! It was absolutely scrumptious.   The line for this place was literally out the door and well into the parking lot (I'm so not kidding..who knew ice-cream could be so good on a chilly November night). You could literally smell the homemade goodness of the fresh baked goods.   Customer service was great! The folks behind the counter truly made the customers feel like they enjoyed what they were doing and loved it! (These did not appear to be high school students, rather young mature adults....huge plus). From the moment you walk through the door you are greeted with a smile. And, they are extremely helpful when it comes to making a selection. There is almost too much on the menu to immediately walk in and know what you want.  In addition to ice-cream and fresh baked goods, there appeared to be quite the candy selection there. And not just any candy either. I'm talking almost nostalgic....kinda coincides with the theme of the establishment.  Too bad they don't have a Churn on the East side of town by their other sister restaurants (hint hint).   Overall, Churn is 5 stars in my book.

Mr. B and I decided for pie this evening. We arrived at a good time (Happy Hour; best time of the day). We immediately sat down at the bar and began to peruse the menu. There were 10 patrons throughout the entire establishment (including the tables outside). That in mind, I'm curious why the service was so mediocre (3 stars).  We started out with an order of french fries (parsley, garlic, lemon zest, pecorino cheese, chili flakes with garlic aioli). There was another couple at the bar having the same and they LOOKED delicious. For an entree we decided to share a Humble Pie Signature Sausage Pizza (roasted fennel, house-made mozzarella, tomato sauce). Mr. B has a thing for everything sausage. All of that was washed down with a few glasses of Pinot Noir.  Though the fries were visually tasty looking in front of others, I have to say I was rather disappointed when I received our order. Its apparent that they're frozen pre-cut fries however, they shouldn't taste as such. The wet ingredients overpowered the fries making them horribly soggy and extremely cold. If I were to rate the fries on their own merit, they'd be worthy of a whooping 3 stars.  The Signature Sausage gets a good 5 stars (we've been back several times and Mr. B gets the SAME thing every time). The combo of the ingredients is perfect! Something about that fennel. If you are really hungry, grab a pie for self. Should you adore your company (as much as I do mine), I'd suggest sharing a pie and perhaps a salad to bring your meal full circle (you won't be overstuffed). Definitely a pie you should consider.  I am quite disappointed with the level of service that we received, or lack thereof. For there to only be a few people in the restaurant, I found it unacceptable that servers were not attending their respective areas as they should. Our bartender spent more time away from his area than he did behind the bar (there were only 4 of us at the bar). The disappointment that night has not stopped me from returning (I LOVE A GOOD PIE) however, I am cautious as to whether we dine in or take-out.

Visited here a few weeks back for Thursday Ladies Nite. I really enjoyed the Karrage Chicken salad. We ordered a lot of food and didn't realize how quickly things added up. The service was a bit slow; the place was not crowded at all. Be careful of the bill, the promotion was not added to the bill the first time around and there were additional drinks added to our bill due to too many people servicing the table and no communication amongst themselves. Nonetheless, the servers and the management were very cordial and friendly.

For airport food, this was pretty decent. Ordered fish tacos and they brought me shrimp. Waitress felt bad and brought me two extra fish tacos, so I could taste them. AND AND they are hardly selfish with the avocado! I got over a 4th of an avocado on each taco. Do the math!   The waitress was helpful and extremely friendly.    And don't get me started on the margarita! Don Julio Cadillac Margarita, and MAN! It was RIGHT! She was not selfish with the tequila and I sure appreciated that!   I will DEFINITELY try again.

I've been dying to try this place for months; I bookmarked it over 7 months ago. Mr. B. and I decided to give it a try on Sat. (we loved it so much that we went again after our Monday morning workout). The customer service here is second to none and the menu is perfect (not too little, not too much).  Saturday the cashier suggested we try the potato salad along with the jalapeño chips (key here is to use the chips as the spoon..holy toledo Batman!). As a first timer she asked if we like Kale salad and offered it up for free (another excellent selection). The dressing is made of mandarin oranges and it is good.  I had a #33 (feta, parmesan, tomatoes, spinach, fresh basil and 2 poached eggs [they were more on the soft boiled side in my opinion but, good nonetheless]) and added bacon. My entire face was in my plate but, Mr. B. had a #66 (cheddar, 2 poached eggs, bacon, tomatoes, green onions and zookz ginger cream cheese sauce). That sauce that was absolutely divine.   Monday we tried #'s 45 & 60 with a few modifications that didn't disappoint. This is definitely a place to stop by if you're in the area or drive the distance if you're not. Regardless, you won't be disappointed.

I am a fan of donuts, especially those that melt in your mouth. This was clean and the staff was friendly and accommodating (huge plus).  There is something about the dough that makes these donuts very light and moist. The glaze is everything! It's just right--smooth and not too sweet.  DEFINITELY a stop on my way to work.

I've been coming here for several years now and have seen many waxers come and go (all good waxers I might add) but, Tambra is awesome!  She's very professional and takes her time with each client. She is extremely meticulous and ensures no strays are left behind. Tambra is also the resident trainer so, all the newbies are trained right.  Jezzerae, one of the receptionists, is so sweet and professional. There are other girls but they are not as courteous as Jezz. She's not pushy with selling and is not rude. I always try to deal with only Jezz when purchasing packages or making appointments.   Although I moved 20 miles away, I can't see going to a closer EWC and exposing my hoo ha to a complete stranger

Mr. B and I attended this shin-dig today...and quite free I might add. 2 thumbs up to the lady at will call. Even though someone made a boo-boo on our tickets, she happily gave us two passes for the day. (Will Call Lady you are a superstar!)  I have to say that I was quite impressed with the event that WM put on; being there in person makes watching it on television seem unreal. I couldn't believe how many people were actually there. Though quite rowdy in several areas, the event was well organized. For the MOST part, the Pro Em workers were courteous and friendly.  Parking was free and they had nice buses to transport to and from the course. WM had plenty of concession stands spread out throughout the course. I can only imagine how much money was made on beer and water alone. I paid $4 for a bottle of water; thats an entire 24pack from Sam's thank you very much! To think if only 1/4 of the attendees purchased ONLY water. The only downside was the main grub station (where all the main food vendors were). It appeared as though there were 5k sardines packed into a corner; it was absolutely absurd.  It is quite the event to people watch; wasn't surprised at the spectacle that people made of themselves. We'll be back though. Mr. B and I could ALWAYS use a good laugh.

Still on a quest for the absolute BEST donut, so far, even with my unpleasant drive-thru experience last Thursday (another story for a different day), Arizona Donut Co. in Tempe is at the top of my list.  The ladies here were very friendly, solely what my rating is based off of (even got a free sample of Chai tea w/Boba). The donuts, on the other hand, were JUST ok; they get a whole 2 stars at best.  I tried an old-fashioned glaze and a glaze twist, half of which is sitting in a bag on the counter.  I don't care to taste the oil that the donuts were fried in. Let alone, see it through the dough. Doubt I return for donuts however; there is a slim chance I might try their boba drinks (the guy in line said they're really good here).

This place reminds me of Project Pie (San Diego) except not as Urban. The price is perfect; 1 price whether you choose one of their creations or pile the goodies on your own. The ingredients are fresh and the pies are delish. Hats off to the originator of the concept (it's not Fired Pie but, all the same). I created my own:  Pesto Traditional Mozzarella Fresh Mozzarella Feta Grilled Chicken Sautéed Spinach Artichokes Sautéed Mushrooms Kalamata Olives Fresh Tomatoes (after it came out the oven)  11" of heaven  The Bellini's weren't bad for $5 either!

It's sad that the people behind the counter recognize me and remember my order (same thing every time!). The ingredients are fresh, which you can taste with EVERY bite.  I really appreciate the fact that I've seen the owner behind the counter during our last two visits, and he wasn't just giving orders, he was starting pies. Seeing that says a lot about his passion for his business and his customers. In the few minutes that we were there (we ordered to-go) he started a few pies (mine included) and walked around the restaurant to personally speak with the customers. Two thumbs up and 10 stars for that!   My new favorite pizza spot!

So I've been here twice within the past 2 weeks (it's the Moscow Mule; I'm hooked). Having changed my diet 6 months ago (Pescatarian only) I am skeptical of trying new places in fear that they won't have anything to satisfy my tastebuds.   I stumbled across this cute spot one day via Groupon. Knowing I was dining alone, I called the manager and was informed that, while the Groupon was for two, I could use the discount granted I purchase an entree. Done! After perusing the short menu I opted for the Crab Fried Rice and Egg Rolls. I wasn't mad either! The Crab Fried Rice was delicious; though for $17 a plate I would expect a tad bit more for my palate, I'm not complaining. I washed both down with, not one but, 2 Moscow Mules (one with plain Vodka and the other with Cranberry). Absolutely delicious! I typically stay with my top shelf Cadillac Margarita but I'm glad I tried something new. Deep Eddy Vodka is a must try!  Now my second trip...ehhh. While my two Moscow Mules and the live music were on point, I tried something new; Papaya Salad. Now...the first item of the description reads: Grilled Prawns. Oh boy! It's on and poppin'! Added an order of Egg Rolls and I was good to go. I guzzled down my first Mule and my food arrived. Right on time. Salad piled high and Egg Rolls delicately placed on the plate. I dipped and chewed, dipped and chewed. Mmm!   As I gently cut up my salad I noticed two shrimp sitting cute on the corner of the squared plate. Great! I thought, garnish. The rest must be under the julienned papaya and carrots. I was a little miffed to find that there were NO more shrimp (they weren't big enough to be labeled as prawns in my book). I politely called a waitress over and asked if the salad came with only two shrimp. And she pleasantly said, "Yes". WHAT?! I would've been embarrassed to admit that. There should've at least been 4-5. My goodness! I cut each one into fourths to spread out the goodness I WAS expecting and kept it moving.   Nonetheless, the service is great! I just wish the portions were plentiful.

After dropping my phone hundreds of times without cracking the screen, it finally happened on Sunday. Usually I would go on and not worry but, this contraption was cutting up my fingers and the side of my face (no joke) I'm talking shards.   I looked around and found this place on Yelp. Upon calling (Rob) quoted a reasonable price and timeframe for completing the services. I arrived late in the afternoon and Troy fixed my phone in less than 10 mins. The price for the screen was actually $10 cheaper than quoted due to the version of iPhone I have (5 vs. 5s). I also got tempered glass added to the screen, which took another 5 mins to install. All this and good service for under $80! Score! Troy was quick and super professional. Would definitely recommend.   Shh! There are two other perks you should make note of: 1) by checking in on Yelp you get a $5 off coupon to use right then and there; and 2) if you leave a review (of any kind) on Yelp you get a $10 off coupon that you can use on a future visit or share with a friend (caveat is the review must be left within 2 days of your fix). Not a bad deal at all.

11,628 Flavor combinations from 19 glazes and 14 toppings. How can you possibly go wrong? We purchased 1/2 dozen of their favorites (pics to follow).  The donuts were exceptionally warm and delicious; probably would've been the bomb dot com had I eaten them right then and there. Not that they weren't hood when I got home, simply knowing that they are ALWAYS warm makes me drool with anticipation of eating one freshly dipped. Mmmm!   The place is rather clean and bright. A nice sized flat screen tv adorns the wall in the dining area, and the patio (though not going to be inviting in the upcoming months) will be a cool ticket on those beautiful Fall, some Winter, and Spring days. Do we even have Fall here in AZ? Lol.  The staff was very pleasant. The ONLY downfall are the prices. $1.89 for 1 donut! Holy cow! Its a regular sized cake donut. Nonetheless, you gotta pay for good food, right?  For all you really nice people who adore your fellow office coworkers (or not), they do have a "Corporate Card" that lends $2 off if you buy 2 dozen donuts. And a free dozen if you purchase 5 dozen...all must be purchased at the same time. Nothing fancy smancy, but at $1.89 each every damn penny counts!

Changing one's name does not change the fact that the establishment still exists. I've experienced the WORST service with "The Sushi Room" now Rock Lobster. I purchased a Groupon a few months back to eat sushi with my daughter and that is where the horrible service saga began.  Making reservations is an absolute joke! When I first purchased the Groupon, we made the reservation as required in the fine print. We arrived 15 mins early and sat outside. 15 mins later our drink orders were taken. Another 10, the drinks arrive and we order. We sat outside for 45 mins with NO food and no real service. The restaurant was NOT crowded! When I requested to cancel the order and pay for the drink I drank, I was told my food was almost ready. Not quite, I'm leaving! We were offered the food for free, but by this time I was quite upset because I was hungry and irritated. Stuck with the Groupon, I was forced to use it before it expired. Thanks for nothing Chase Bank!  Today, I had my mother call and make a reservation for 5:30 pm and she was told they only had a 5:45 pm open. Upon arrival at 5:35 pm we were told that we had no reservation. Hmmm. Really?! Why is this the same girl who provided no service the last visit? And why does the sign on the wall state that Teppan ressy's start at 5 pm? Could the night get any worse? Hmmm, let's see:  - With the addition of the Teppan, the waitress should ask whether or not a guest wants a regular or Teppan seat. Don't automatically walk me to a tray table (too small for 2 people). I made a reservation for the Teppan table that apparently NEVER made it to the book - You have happy hour, but I could only get HH drinks at the Teppanyaki table. Suggestion: Make a special "Teppan HH Menu". This might serve your business well - No real Vodka or decent beer options; at least not for me. Absolute Vodka and Bud Light are low budget. Step up your game - While it is restaurant week, I had to request the RW menu. No bueno - We were told we could sit anywhere at the Teppan table however, should more people arrive we'd have to move down. Great! Right when my a$$ has warmed the seat. Though Benihana's has gone downhill, this place could learn something. Seat people correctly the first time. I'M NOT GETTING UP ONCE I'M COMFORTABLE!  NOTE: I actually saw her ask a family with a disabled child to move once others arrived. Rude and unprofessional. The family was there first and shouldn't have been asked to move. If anything, the incoming family of six should've been sat at the Teppan table in the back.  - The waitress barely came to inquire if we were ok or if we needed anything. And being the nice person I am, still left a tip. Shame on me. - And last but not least, when I showed her the Groupon she went to touch my phone. (Excuse me! You're in my personal space and attempting to touch my personal property! No bueno!) I will mark the Groupon as redeemed. Don't ever touch a customer's phone.   BUYER BEWARE! NEW NAME SAME OWNERS (APPARENTLY) AND SAME WAITRESSES, WHICH IS HARD TO TELL WITHOUT THE CHANGE IN SERVER ATTIRE (FROM BOOTY SHORTS TO BLACK PANTS AND A BLACK UNIFORM T-SHIRT)....THE ONLY THING THIS PLACE DID RIGHT. NEVER AGAIN!

It took them a while, but these Barista's are on it. Though they've only been open for about 2 months, they are picking up and quite anxious to provide good service.  When first learning my drink order they stumbled a few times. Nonetheless they always offered to remake until they got it right. Kala and Sam are always super friendly (the other Barista's are too, I just don't know their names).  Just like the other locations I frequent, they know my drink before I order, making my visit expeditious.

I absolutely LOVE coming here for brunch! Although the wait tends to be quite excessive, I usually can grab a single seat at the bar within minutes of my arrival. When there are 2-3 of us, we are usually seated at the bar within 15 mins upon arrival (Tip: ALWAYS ALWAYS head for the bar.) I've frequented this location over a dozen times and have yet to sit at an actual table (I've lost my appetite after 45 mins and, once it hits an hour I've gone from hungry to borderline postal...no thanks).  Service (5 stars all the way): Not one time have I come here and not been greeted with a warm smile and friendly face. The bartenders are the best servers (since that's all I've experienced). Being a regular helps, they always know what drink I want before I order...makes my life so much easier. It seems that they get tastier and tastier with each visit. Try the Mmm Mmm Mimosa.  Food (5 stars): Some of the food items tend to rotate with the season. If you have an opportunity, try the Sweet Potato Pancakes. Man! They're so good. I typically get The Snooze Classic (3 cage free eggs cooked anyway you like, hash browns, choice of meat and toast), which I sub the meat for avocado and the toast for a pancake for a small up charge (sweet potato of course)!  If you love Eggs Benedict, they have quite the selection. And these are NOT your obvious selections either. You have the option of mix and matching those bad boys for an optimal experience. I opt for either the Benny Goodman (Lox style salmon and cream cheese, poached cage free eggs, cream cheese hollandaise blended with sun dried tomato and caper relish on sourdough) or the Bella! Bella! Benny (Thin slices of prosciutto, Taleggio cheese, perfectly poached eggs on toasted ciabatta, topped with cream cheese hollandaise, balsamic glaze and arugula). I'm certain at some point I will try other menu options however, for right now, I'm sticking to the items that pacify my cravings for good food!  Atmosphere (4 stars): I've visited 3 of their 4 valley locations. Gilbert has been my place of choice (perhaps they make the best drinks..or maybe its because I'm a creature of habit..who knows...LOL). Tempe is ALWAYS crowded due to the location near the college. It may also be the fact that another awesome restaurant shares the sidewalk and entrance with Snooze so, folks probably toggle back and forth. They could use additional seating for those waiting. The Phoenix location is in a prime area (Biltmore-Camelback). I've only visited there once but, the crowds are not as popular as the other locations I've frequented (maybe folks in the area haven't caught on to the Snooze concept. LOL). The decor almost reminds me of the 50's.   Snooze is a definite must if you haven't tried them yet. Expect a wait on the weekends. It's worth it if you're hungry.

I'm a fan of pizza! I especially enjoy these eateries where I can dictate the amount of toppings on my pie. The whole made-to-order concept is pleasing to the stomach. There are other made-to-order pie places that I frequent however, not as much as I do Pielology. This establishment is larger than most so allows for the larger crowds to stand in line, order and not feel crowded by people. Ugh!  The service here at Chandler Fashion Square is exceptionally good. I'm always greeted with a smile and a nice gesture when I exit.   The addition of olive oil on the crust before baking adds a slight crunch to the bite that...Ohh Emm Gee...it's hard to explain. They offer both regular and wheat crust (wheat is the way to go). The pie size appears to be larger than most places leaving me with 1/2 a pie every time (perfect for my inner chubby kid). The toppings here are fresh and the tomatoes (they have the cherry tomatoes halved...just how I like 'em...way better than regular sliced or roma).   Pieology is my first choice for made-to-order pizza; even though there are two different places closer to my home. The longer ride is totally worth the pie!

Mr. B. and I stopped here Sunday for pizza to watch the Basketball game at home. Immediately upon walking in, we were greeted with friendly faces and courteous service. I'm a fan of 'Build Your Own Pie'; this is the only BYOP restaurant that I know of that offers 2 sizes. I was exceptionally pleased with the level of service at this location. The shift manager (young girl) was extremely engaged with her staff (something you don't see to often). The staff as also friendly and courteous. No matter what they were doing, every time someone walked in or out of the building, they were spoken to accordingly. The prep station was clean and inviting; the staff wiped up after each of order.  I LOVE greens but, I have yet to try their salads. But how can you go wrong? You control the outcome.  OASN (on a side note): The Marion Berry Lemonade is to die for! (One of these days I'm going to bring some home and mix with some vodka. LOL)

I'm giving them 4 when they should really get 3.5; my rating is based solely on service. When I'm in the area, I tend to try whatever is around. Being as this place is new, I thought I'd give it another try while in the area shopping.  When you walk in you are immediately greeted by someone standing at the door; at least I have on both occasions. The place is generally clean and the workers are super friendly. 5 stars for that.  For a soup, sandwich, salad establishment I'm not all that impresses with the sandwiches.   The line starts with salads and sandwiches. Moving down the line you have toppings at the second station and soup at the third (you can sample every single one of their soups). So far, I haven't sampled one that I didn't like. The fouth station is the dessert window; quite the variety to choose from. (You meal will come with either a chocolate dipped strawberry or Oreo cookie and a section of french bread).  While I only tried two different panini's, they didn't taste real (if that makes sense). I don't know if it was the sauces/spreads but, I definitely won't try those again. Their soups are rather tasty! DEFINITELY will try again; Wild Mushroom and Wisconsin Cauliflower are delish!   As an fyi, toppings are $.69. Now, while I have NO problem paying for anything extra, I do expect to get what I pay for. Rather disappointed in the lack of cheddar I paid for to top off my soup. My next visit I may try salad only.   This isn't my first choice for soup/salad combo's but, they're not totally off the list of options.

We stopped here one night after I noticed that they were the "Hot New Trending" business on Yelp! We walked in on a Sunday about 30 mins before closing and received (IMHO) stellar service.  We were greeted by the owner who was patient enough to give us an overview of the selection process and the toppings (not every topping is self explanatory; he's got a varietal of meats and sauces and could suggest what works best together). After we ordered, our slices arrived about 15 mins later and it was well worth the wait. The artwork on the wall tells a story of it's own which will have you staring off while you chomp down on your meal.  There is no way to come up short in a place like this. The options are in abundance from the toppings to the sauces. You drive what goes in your mouth here. Either select from a creation on the wall or craft your own masterpiece.   It was definitely nice to buy slices vs. an entire pie, even though you have can do that as well. Doing so allowed us the chance to explore their menu options without the commitment of an entire pie. Mr. B. and I love pizza and will definitely keep My Slice of the Pie on our list of contenders.
