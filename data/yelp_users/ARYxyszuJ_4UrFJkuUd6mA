This place is horrible. I spoke to a manager about a charge on my card from a gas purchase the day prior. He started yelling at me and ran to his car and took off. Come to find out he was lying about the gas station's policy on authorized holds on cards. He stated he had nothing to do with it. Then he invited me to complain to Chevron Corporate and said they can't touch him, he owns the place. I've been to many gas stations, and never encountered a manager or supposed owner that had such a lack of professionalism, and customer service. He said people come in all the time asking about the $100 hold on their cards... Well, don't you think it would be wise to post something on the pump then? Since it is the MERCHANTS choice to set the authorization amount (Chevron Store 4737). I have several gas stations in my area that don't put $100 hold on your card for gas. It was ridiculous. Never going back, and will make sure to advise my friends and co workers to do the same.

I had been wanting to try this place for a while, and finally stopped in today for Christmas Eve lunch. Soooo happy I did! I ordered the Catfish, which came with grilled veggie kabobs and the most delicious rice with slivered almonds and raisins. The service was excellent, fast and friendly. The food was fresh, well seasoned, and the portions were generous. I ended on a sweet note, with the baklava. The layers of phyllo dough were flaky, and it wasn't overly sweet, which is a good thing. A lot of times it can be soggy and super sweet. This wasn't, it was perfect. I can't wait to go back.

I have loved Zipp's for years, and have been to their locations all across the valley. I was craving a burger, and they've never let me down before. And was pleasantly surprised to be able to get a table for 3 so quickly with the college bowl games going on; that was a plus. Our waitress came over to our table and took our drink order promptly. When she came back with our drinks we placed our dinner order. 30 minutes go by and our burgers come out, 1 was the wrong burger, the other was ice cold, the 3rd was fine. So, 2/3 of the food goes back to the kitchen as we watch and wait. 30 minutes later the 2nd burger comes out, then 15 minutes after that, the 3rd burger comes out. At this point, none of us were eating together. The waitress apologized and said she'd get it right next time... The food & the service didn't warrant a return visit honestly. I won't be going back to that location again.

This place has plenty of seating, good happy hour, and knowledgable servers. The drinks were very good and strong. The food came out fast and was delicious. There was a good selection on the menu for drinks and food. The patio area was perfect. And there was live music inside and sounded great.

I can't believe this place has practically been in my backyard and I just discovered it. The food was OUT OF THIS WORLD. We had the crispy Korean cauliflower for a starter along with the chilled car dip and plantains. For dinner we sampled the Thai ribs, salmon, and Grilled steak salad. All of which was excellently prepared and tasted outrageous. Dessert was a warm mixed berry bread pudding and was the perfect way to end the meal. Not too sweet, just right. Atmosphere is great, service is excellent, staff is very friendly. We didn't have a reservation and day out on the patio and it was perfect, watching the sunset and drinking their skinny super fruit margaritas. Definitely would recommend this place and will be back very soon!

This place is such an easy choice! It's super close to my house, the menu choices are plentiful, healthy, and delicious. The service is phenomenal. When Richa handles our table, she is always so friendly, the food comes out fast, and right the first time. She is very attentive, and always makes us want to come back. I have recommended this place and taken friends here, and they all love it.

There are so many delicious options for brunch at this place. No matter what you order, it will come out fast, right, and always taste good. They are consistent every time, come in once a weekly, once a month, or once a year, and the food will always taste good. The staff is always friendly,  service top notch. The cocktails are strong and the espresso is very good. There is always a crowd, but the wait is minimal, and so worth it. The counter is truly the best spot.

I have been to this place on and off since it first opened. And it's always delicious. They have a great variety of flavors on a good rotation. It's always clean, and the staff is always friendly. They have really good perks too, like double points or buy one/get one. Especially now that it's getting warmer, I will be there on the regular. It offers a good lighter option for lunch. The fruit is always fresh, and the toppings provide a good selection.

I heard about this place from a co-worker. It's close to my office, so I checked it out. I am a New Yorker, born and raised, and I love my bagels. This place is hands down THE BEST bagel west of the Mississippi. If you love authentic NY style bagels, search no further. Puts Chompie's to shame. Delicious bagels, friendly staff, great prices, and fast service. Please check this place out!!

The grooming salon was extremely helpful. They were able to fit me in today to get my dog groomed. They even took the time to transfer his records from the Desert Ridge location. I wanted to get my Aussie mix a Summer Shave. Holley the groomer did an unbelievable job! She was super nice, and Jax looks incredible! I will definitely take Jax back to see Holley. What a great groomer!!!

Food was mediocre. We had breakfast; waffles, eggs, bacon. Nothing outstanding about the meal. Coffee was cold, had to wait for a place setting. The service was horrible, staff couldn't care less. Absolutely NOT worth a repeat visit.

This place is great! I've been to the one on the west side many times, but today was my first visit at the Tatum location. Got a perfect seat to watch my football team, our waitress was the best (Kristen) very attentive & friendly. The food was good, came out fast, the drinks are strong, and the prices are reasonable. Will definitely be back for the rest of the season. There are plenty of TV's, so no worries on finding your game. So glad we stopped in!
