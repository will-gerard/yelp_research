Excellent service. I walked in at 9 am with a pool pump that was inconsistent and they had me out the door ten minutes later with a repaired pump and bill under $15! Talk about a great way to start the day, I was expecting a much bigger bill! Thanks Checker, Ill be back!

One of the worst la's out there. It's dirty and many of the machines were down when I went in. I don't expect much with la fitness, but this visit was below the low bar that I'm used to with la fitness
