This place is designed for the super drunk masses taking part in the Fremont Street Experience. If you aren't super drunk, which we weren't, you're going to regret paying the 50 cent fee to use a credit card. I mean, who does that? Joints that cater to captive, stumbling, money-is-no-object audience do, I guess.  Take one of the other reviewer's advice and hit up the McDonald's down the street.

Cibo has a great patio, a few quality happy hour offerings, and the exciting promise of gluten free pizza. Sadly, the good things about it didn't make up for the not so good things. On the plus side, the polenta fries were fantastic and the wife was a big fan of the gnocchi. On the minus side, the pizza was relatively tasteless (like it needed salt) and I'm pretty sure it made me sick. I don't know if it was the gluten free option or the cheese, of which I rarely eat, but I woke up the next morning violently ill. My wife ate the same thing and didn't have a problem, so perhaps it was a fluke. Either way, it just didn't excite us the way the Yelp reviews did. Much sadness ensued.

I feel sorry for people who go to Vegas and never find themselves downtown. Yeah, it's seedy, trashy, uncomfortable and low-class... but it's also pretty damn fabulous.  If you're serious about gambling and don't own a professional sports team, it's also the best place to lose your money. Drop your pretenses, grab a plastic football of your favorite alcoholic beverage and enjoy the most honest experience Las Vegas has to offer. If you don't have fun here, you're doing it wrong.

I'm about as nostalgic for the 50's as someone can be for something they've never experienced. I'm certain I've over-romanticized it in my head and created a world where life was simpler because everything was a perfect little polished version of what we have now. It's likely because of this that I had the biggest, most juvenile grin on my face when we walked into Bettie Page.  They had an awesome selection, at least to my undiscerning male eyes. Most aren't very practical, at least not for us east coasters, but I'm guessing you'd get a ton of use if you were into the Rockabilly scene in California (Yeah, that's what we think of you Californians in these parts!) or work as a pinup model etc. If it means anything, it's probably the only time I've ever been in a clothing store and pulled a half dozen dresses off the rack for Mrs Chris D to try on. :-D  The staff were aloof and indifferent... but their hair looked cool! Not like it really registered 'cause everything was perfect in the 50's and as such, there wasn't anything negative to notice. What's that you say about how poor service should impact the overall rating? Lalalalalala... I can't hear you.

I've been holding on to my Joe Beef experience because humans, especially those with OCD, place an unreasonable amount of significance on round numbers. When I realized I was coming up on my 250th review, I figured I would save the honor for what I consider to be one of the top five dining experiences in my lifetime. Yeah, it was that good.  First, special thanks to my friend Mike H. for pointing us in the direction of Joe Beef. I was laser focused on eating at Au pied de cochon during our time in Montreal and prior to him enlightening me, had never heard of ole Joe. We ended up eating at both restaurants and in my (not so) humble opinion, Mr. Beef blows the other place out of the water.  I have to admit that when we walked in to JB, everything about it was uncomfortable. The lights were dim, the music was loud and the small space was so chocked full of tables that you couldn't help but feel everyone was staring at you. This feeling was amplified by the fact that our waitress asked us to study the blackboard menu on the wall while they pulled our table out for us. The two things of note here are that there are no paper menus, so the person with their back to the board needed to decide before they sat, and the tables were so close the staff have to let you in and lock you down... like some sort of culinary roller coaster.  Our food came from nearly every part of the animal kingdom. We had oysters. Great. We had foie gras. Fantastic. The wife had schnitzel. Good. I had a horse steak (yeah, horse... or is it naaay, horse?). Very Good. Everything was expertly prepared and presented in a "Hey, we like food but we aren't all prissy about it" sorta way. I don't like prissy. I liked this. The drinks were just as expertly prepared and equally as delicious. Putting a raw oyster on top of my Bloody Caesar? Uhhh, brilliant. (see pic)  Truth be told, the food was not the highlight of the meal. Our waitress, Vanya, may very well be the best server we've ever had. Not only was she knowledgeable, efficient, witty, professional and everything else you look for in wait staff, she was quite simply... lovely. There was something about her warm and friendly way of interacting with you that made you feel like you were the Greatest Person to Have Ever Walked the Planet. I know what you're thinking, Chris is just a sucker for blondes and his enthrallment with Vanya was probably because he'd love any blonde that feeds him. That's not an entirely invalid perception, however my wife had pretty much the same opinion of Vanya... and she's not in to chicks... or so she says. Hmm, give me a minute. Where was I? Oh yes, Vanya. We loved her.  Perhaps the most surprising thing about the restaurant, besides the buffalo in the bathroom, was just how homey it became by the end of the night. I can see how people wouldn't like the close quarters, but have a few cocktails and suddenly the tables around you are welcomed dinner companions. For what it's worth, I went from telling my wife "I don't want to eat dinner with them" to high-fiving one of the two guys eating next to us by the time we left. We didn't have to pop our collars. We already knew we were cool.  I firmly believe Joe Beef is going places. They don't have a ton of reviews, but with some of the press they've been getting lately, I expect that number to explode. If others' experiences are anything like ours, they will be firmly rooted at 4.5 stars well into the triple digits. They deserve it.

Yes, I am writing a review while traveling. Some things are just worth talking about as soon as you can so you can move on. That's pretty much the case for this place so here I am. We stopped mid-day on the Thursday before the Canadian GP to have a beer and soak up the street party/festival outside. They had open tables, had poutine on the menu and it seemed like prices would be comparatively decent. $19 for a pitcher of good beer wasn't bad, but everything else was pretty much crap. With it's marginal bar food and wet floors, it's obviously a place where people (who aren't us) party into the wee hours, spill drinks on each other and swap communicable diseases. Definitely not my thing.

Two pitchers of sangria later, I approve.  Seriously though, this is clearly a family run joint where the father is in the kitchen and the children are working the front of house. That, plus food which was far more authentic than I expected (umm, cactus garnish?) makes for a small business that really deserves to be rated favorably. Was everything a home run? No, not really... but it was still better than every other Americanized Mexican joint I've been to in the States.   Whatever you are doing Restaurant El Meson, please don't stop. Merci.

Much like prom night as a teen boy, Au pied is one of those things you fantasize about long before you ever experience it. Also much like prom night, it ends up being a bit of a let down. Not because you built it up so much in your head that it couldn't possibly measure up, but because no matter how good an effort is made, it'll still end up awkward.  I wanted to love Au pied, I really did. The space was very cool, the setting intimate and service exemplary. The food, however, felt like it was trying hard... too hard... to be different. I can appreciate a chef taking chances, or making their own way, but dinner here was more like being a guinea pig in a mad scientist's experiment than it was being along for a culinary journey with a genius. Black bean sauce on a seafood platter? Ehh, not feeling it.  Make no mistake, everything was good. They are doing some interesting things with quality ingredients and for the most part, they're successful. What they aren't doing is blowing me away with every course... or even really convincing me that I have to go back. In a city that kicks most other cities' asses in the food department, there are better options.  As a side note, we did get to see what I'm convinced is the largest lobster to ever be captured. It was ordered by a table next to us, had to be carried by two men on a large wooden platter and was clearly inspiration for a few sci-fi flicks. Think I'm full of ish? Check the pic below. See? Massive! (That's what she said.)  Super mutant lobster: http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/cKdox2gt3L1Dbb7MpOPdWg?select=V6jWNIwBBnP7NR0Q7_VP_A

I was actually kinda dreading getting to 299 reviews because that meant I would have to man up and write this review... one I've been holding for four months. Well, the time has come and I can't hold it off any longer. It's time to put Sage in the books and celebrate another hundred.  If you haven't figured it out yet, Sage was one for the ages. Or is it one for the Sages? Ha!  It's interesting what you remember four months after eating at a restaurant. The little things are gone and what remains are the things you probably won't ever forget. At Sage, it was the impeccable service. It was my awesome veal cheek entree. It was the oh so tacky (and historically inaccurate) way of lighting the sugar cube for our Absinthe. And most notably, it was the ab-so-loot-ly ah-may-zing foie gras brulee appetizer. I haven't taken the time to rank them, but that delicious, delicious blend of gamey creaminess is in the top three starters of all time. It was just that good. Honestly, every bit of that meal made it a fantastic way for my wife and I to celebrate our eighth anniversary.  That's it. That's all I waited four months to say. Now go eat.

It took me until my fifth visit to Las Vegas to take the time to see the sign. I always figured "Oh, I do it later" and never got around to it. After finally taking the time to walk the two miles from our hotel (I have no idea why we walked) I can say I've seen it. Will I see it again? Yeah, probably not... unless I somehow end up there at 3 o'clock in the morning after a night only Vegas can offer.  Did you know the circles that make the word WELCOME are coins? I didn't.

Fan-freaking-tastic. I was skeptical given it's name and temporary looking tent in front of Ceasar's make it seem like a lame attempt to impersonate a Cirque show. Turns out, this is one of the most entertaining shows I've ever seen. The jokes were hi-larious, the acts entertaining feats of physical prowess and the music/lights perfectly designed to suck you into the show. We even Shazamed a few songs to get them for ourselves later. I'd see it again in a heartbeat.  Pro tip: There are sometimes guys handing out $20 off coupons near the tent the day of the show. Pick up one of those and buy at the box office to save a whole heap of cash.
