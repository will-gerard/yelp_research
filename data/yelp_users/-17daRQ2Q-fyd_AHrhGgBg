Soo.. Lets start from the very beginning. We had a very good friend pass away who loved Gucci (why I don't know) but he did. So for all of this we wanted to purchase bracelet for his girlfriend and several other people to remember him by. We started our search online and found what we wanted. Great! A cute little silver bracelet with a heart on it, it was a great gift and a great bracelet for each one of us to wear on our wrist to remember him by. We decided to go in to the store to see if they had any in stock. After circling the store several times FINALLY we got someone to help us who treated us like minions. Thanks. Turns out she looked in a few drawers and said she didn't have what we were looking for and to order it online. The next day (Wednesday) we went online and tried ordering - Not Easy - we were not able to add items to our cart - Again Annoying. After all of this we decided to call to order, we wanted to do rush delivery so we could get them on time so we had to get basically everyone they had in random sizes. Not a huge deal but it took about an hour on the phone with them for this process. They had to complete 3 separate orders and although we were paying $35 per order for next day delivery she couldn't guarantee it would arrive by Friday. What? We are paying for next day shipping and you don't know if it will be here 2 days later?  As I mentioned we did rush delivery and had them sent to the office because we knew that we would not be at home when fed ex came and had to sign. After I stressed the importance of this they sent some boxes to the office and some to the billing address, what is their problem! That being said we missed some of them so had to go to fed ex at 6pm on Friday when we needed them by 5pm and then we get them and may I mention they cancelled 4 bracelets last minute and refunded us - Not Ok. Now let's get to the real bad part. Over half of them came TARNISHED with spots all over them. Who goes to a luxury brand and wants defected bracelets - Amateur hour. Again we get back on the phone with customer service who hangs up on is when we tell her what's going on, call back and explains the story to someone else to tells us to chill out. WTF! At this point we don't want the merchandise, they are defective #1 and #2 they have been absolutely awful to us. Game over, don't want to deal with this any more. Next day, go in to store again to see what they can do, maybe clean them or return. They say NO you didn't buy from here so we can't help you with anything. I give Gucci the big FU and will absolutely never do business with you again.

I couldn't be happier with Canine Perferred. My dog is a bit of a handful and is probably not their favorite client. However, every time I bring him in they remember him and are excited to see him. Not only that but they do an amazing job and he always comes out looking great! Not only are they great groomers but Bruzer has also stayed there several times while I have been away. They have a living room area for the dogs to hang out and play with the other dogs during the day so they are not locked up. Again I am not sure if Bruzer is ready to leave when I pick him up, He love it there!

This didn't go so well...YIKES!  Let me start from the beginning. . .  I made a reservation for 8 girls. It was a very special night for us--one of our very best friends just found out the sex of her baby, and wanted to reveal it to all of us together.   Things started off pretty slow, and by slow I mean I had to SHARE MY WATER with my neighbor (not big in the sharing game). Secondly, it took about 10 more minutes before I got to order my glass of wine. (This girl is thirsty)! Thank God for the big stack of bread they brought out--that cooled me down. Time to order...Since I had a work function before dinner, I wasn't that hungry so I asked my water buddy to share a meal with me. Lo and behold the menu says it's an extra $5 to share. WTF, but why? Needless to say, we decided to order separately- I got a small side Caesar and she really wanted the tortellini but right before we ordered they ran out. DARN. They had cheese ravioli though so she just asked for that but with the tortellini sauce-pretty close! Ravioli was $13 and the tort was $15, so we assumed she would just be charged the $15. Stay tuned for how that turned out. Salads came out and mine is a dinner size (not what i was expecting clearly) but the server then tells me that there is only one size. (I would have just not ordered one if I would have known). Then our entrees came out. I tasted her ravioli and it was great, no complaint on the quality or taste of the food. It was legit DELISH! But this is where things go downhill. . When the bill comes out - (by the way they don't have a POS and there is absolutely NO SPLIT CHECKS, real cool) - we look it over and see that her ravioli is $21, so we ask the server how this happened (it's about the price of the 2 entrees together)! She replies, "Well since you switched the sauce its an up-charge of $5, and since you got the caesar thats another $3." Jesus, Mary, and Joseph -- yea I was beyond shocked and ticked off--and this was not even including my "Caesar" that just so happened to be full sized.   Basically, I think it's safe to say that I won't be back which is a shame because I have been coming here for years and have never had a bad experience. :( This was not only the absolute worst service I have ever had, but never in my life have I experienced being up-charged with out being notified first.   Oh yeah, and then the server auto-grated herself 19%...I normally give 20% (even for bad service) but I think she maybe deserved 5 or 10% -- it was the service that ruined this experience in its entirety.   The one good thing that came out of this is ... It's a GIRL! and I got to spend time with my friends.   Bye Felica, xoxo  Allison

I don't even know where to begin. I came in with two of my girl friends. Two of us get there about 5 minutes early and we had said we would like to wait and look at gel colors, no big deal but lady kept insisting that it was her "turn" and couldn't seem to wait another second. We stated that we planned this together and wanted to be sat together if possible. I figured this wouldn't be a problem because there were 2 areas that had 3 chairs in a row together. Again we said we want to all be seated together and we are looking at colors because we didn't know what we wanted yet.  Once our final member came she sat by us and we all started looking at colors. Again the same lady came up and said ok one of you come it's my turn we go my turns and it's my turn. We were not ready since it had been about 3 total minutes since we walked in the door so again we told her we want to be sat together and we will look at colors together since they are all in a big basket and we needed a few more minutes and we would let he know when we were ready. Again she said no which one of you wants go go it's my turn- you can pick out your color in the chair.  So we then felt so awkward and pressured that one of us went. At that time we basically just had to pick a color quick cause we were being separated. They sat her down then the next lady came to take the next one of us and tried sitting her down. She picked a place completely far from the other and again we said there are 3 chairs together and we want to sit together like we had already said twice. So at this point two of us were sitting leaving the 3rd alone, again all of the gel colors are scattered so it was hard to choose. Finally the 3rd sat down and she was instructed to pick a color (out of the 1/3 available) with out being able to take the time to look. We had all wanted to get a special design since this was a very special occasion but they made us pick so fast no one got what they wanted. Since they immediately started our manicures it's hard to look at colors or designs when your hand is in a bowl a luke warm water. Finally after not picking the colors and not getting anything that we wanted they all did a quick terrible job.  The last one if us to start was the first to be done, filing job was inadequate and gel was on our nails as well as all over out finger not sculpted at all. We all had on watches and none of them were removed for the massage. Our "manicure" basically consisted of a rushed polish change. one of us literally got yelled at by her nail tech to stop talking and sit straight and not to move. I was dumbfounded by this experience. I have come to tips and toes over 10 times and have never experienced anything like this. Finally to top it all off all 3 off us woke up the next day with chipped nails, NOT suppose to happen with gel especially since we all work in an office. All and all I can't believe I chose your nail salon to celebrate this special occasion. I have never had a worse experience at a nail salon.

I have gone in to Ken's a few times with decent results and I do not get the HYPE. They are always busy which is a great sign, I have several friends that go their regularly and they seem to like it but clearly I missed the boat on something or am getting the newbies!!   I recently went in with a girlfriend who I have not seen in a while to get Pedi's and catch up, the actual pedi went OK but my guy never even asked me what kind I wanted he just gave me the normal cheap one. I think he was trying to rush but we had an appointment so it was kind of rude, literally i was in the chair for no more then 15-20 minutes. Setting all of that aside they looked a little less than OK but the shape he created with the file was not at all what a toe should looked like AND they chipped after day 2.  Rewind back to my girlfriend now, she was debating if she wanted to get her nails done too and since she had some extra time she figured she would get a quick manicure, the nail tech obviously talked her in to getting gel. Which I guess is no big deal, it last longer and it's a better bang for your buck. Well not in this case, what do ya know with in a few days her nails are chipped! WTF? This is completely the biggest Manicure Fail I have ever heard of.   Honestly, together we have been trying to find a great place in Scottsdale and every single place I go is a fail...  Overall, I would definitely not recommend Kens.

Can you say AMAZING! I honestly can not say one negative thing about this place but I wish that it was closer to me so I could go everyday! I went there after an unexpectedly  great tour at the Rosson House. It was early like 3ish so a few girlfriends and I were the only ones there but that was probably what made the experience so amazing.   We sat at the bar, which is small only fits 5-6 people but Mr. Nobuo; James Beard award winner, himself was behind the bar preparing for the evening. The lady helping us said he is normally very quiet but for some reason he was an amazingly talkative host to us and made the experience impeccable!  We started with flights of Shōchū which they have imported in and it was so smooth! Then we ask Nobeu to pick out a few dishes for us to try! They were absolutely amazing that we couldn't stop there and ended up getting just about everything on the menu. You know a restaurant is great when you have a girl that her diet revolves around ketchup, hamburgers and chicken nuggets and didn't have anything bad to say!  Overall it is a little spendy but worth every penny and recommend it 100%!!!!  Thanks so much for the experience and will be back soon!

So writing this is awkward.. but what was even more awkward was our dining experience the other night. On a serious note: if I wouldn't have been so happy to be with my friends (one of whom was visiting from SF) I think I would have flipped a tit at this experience in its entirety!  Lets start from the beginning - EVO is a nice restaurant. I have never been blown out of my mind, but I have never been disappointed either... until now.  We arrived at 7 and got seated right away--things started off ok. I am not sure if our server ever told us his name but either way, he got us some water and got our drink order. It took a little long for the wine to come out but whatever-- things happen, who cares. Us girls hadn't seen each other in quite sometime so we had immediately started talking and got caught up telling stories. Our server came back and asked "what he could get us." We had a few apps picked out and he also recommended another one. We were all STARVED so we thought the more the merrier! - Check - got the apps ordered.   He started to walk away, leaving me confused over my empty wine glass... he didn't ask if I wanted another. "Ah excuse me sir may I have another glass of wine... thanks." Wine came out (great) we get back to our conversation, intense gossip stories :). These stories were going and going and then I started to think...(This is where it gets awkward,) 'we ordered our apps like 30 minutes ago where are they?' I was not the only one in out group to take note of the incessant delay either. I was so very in to this story thought so I thought I would let it go, and maybe 15 minutes later they finally came out. We all noted how annoying it was but got over it, who cares, we're hungry, lets eat! So start eating our "APPETIZERS" and continued conversation only, fifteen minutes later....where did our server go?? Crickets... Bueller?? Bueller?? Oh there you are, and thanks for stopping by to drop a few ice cubes in the water glass, where is the water though? This is where it gets good...  (30 minutes later..) Server comes back...  "So, could I offer you dessert?"  Our reply... "ummm we haven't even ordered our dinneryet, can we maybe do that and also get some butter cake if we are doing this all at once?" Salads and desserts came out at the same time. At this point we don't even care so we eat it all at once. Finish that.. HELLO where are you now!!! CHECK PLEASE, hello??? 20 minutes later got the check and pay.  By far, this was the most awkward restaurant experience I have ever had and I hope to God if I ever end up back at this restaurant that this sever is no longer employed. I guess not everyone fits the bill.  XOXO

Where to start? It's coma Sunday and all we want is some good delivery food. BBQ sounded like a great option. Started off ordering online and several menu items are not even on there to order. We decided to call and order and it was comical I had no idea what was going to be delivered or if it would even come. On the plus side it was pretty fast but probably because they forgot half the stuff. No utensils, no BBQ so the pork and ribs were dry - the Mac and Cheese tasted like noodles with no cheese and cake tasted like it came from a school cafeteria or a retirement home. I just can't. Ending on a good note I give a hells yea to the slaw.   After this madness we called back and ask them to bring us sauce because otherwise the meat was not eatable and they said they would bring it right over. Great! Unfortunately they never came. Left still hungry and very upset.  Xoxo
