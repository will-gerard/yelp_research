The saying "wash your veggies before you eat them" takes on a whole new meaning for me today.  The lettuce in my taco tasted like dish water! The taste was an instant turn off.  I no longer go in to eat as the overwhelming smell of bad meat hits you as you walk in the door!   The beans on the nachos reminds me of mud and tastes about the same.  Truly a fast food place with increasingly nasty food every time I go.

Dirty store to match the parking lot. Smells like sewage by the self check outs and staff is quick to run and hide before helping.

Last Monday (9/10), I called my doctors' office to ask for a prescription to be refilled (that I have been on since 2002 for seizures and restless leg syndrome) called Clonazepam. I was told that the script would be called in to Walgreen's. It wasn't. On Tuesday, Kylie, my daughter, went in to the office to drop off an update d Power of Atty and Living Will (for an upcoming surgery) and asked about the prescription, and was told that it would be called in to the pharmacy that afternoon. It wasn't. I called again on Wednesday, now three days without the pill, only to be told that it would be called in, and again, it wasn't. On Thursday, I was told that the pharmacy had to send over a fax request to have the script filled and that the doctor would not be back in the office till this Monday, which means I would be without the med for a total of 7 (SEVEN) days! I was then put on the phone with a man claiming to be the office manager who told me that the message (which I have never heard, because if you are placed on hold, 623.298.4642, there is no message, just dead silence) would tell you that your pharmacy must send in a fax request...NOT! He refused to listen to my story even telling me that it was my fault and that he didn't care that I used to be a nurse and that he didn't care who screwed up that it was my fault. He yelled at me, wouldn't let me speak and told me that there was nothing he could do. Consequently, last night, I had a grand mal seizure that could have killed me. Google Clonazepam, and look up what happens when you suddenly stop taking this drug after so many years. I have complained to AHCCCS and will complain to Dr. Jeanette Cruz, of Estrella Family Medical the next time I see her. LAWSUIT? POSSIBLY. You don't have to put up with the bull. I could have been told on Monday to have the script request faxed, and problem would have been solved. My daughter could have been told that on Tuesday or handed a script when she was there, but no. At no time were we told...This office dropped the ball, but it's my fault... I COULD HAVE DIED. I WANT HEADS TO ROLL AND PEOPLE FIRED. AM I MAD, DAMN RIGHT I AM MAD. I HAVE KIDS TO RAISE AND A LIFE TO LIVE. JUST BECAUSE SOME OFFICES REQUIRE A PHARMACY TO SEND A SCRIPT REQUEST, DOESN'T MEAN THEY ALL DO, AND I HAVE NEVER HAD TO DO THIS BEFORE!!  ~~ I got a certified letter today, 9/20, telling me that I have been fired.  That tells me that this office can't admit to their mistakes and that I am glad that as of October, I am glad I am no longer their patient.  I have alerted AHCCCS, the Arizona Medical Review Board and will be filing a Medical Malpractice Lawsuit as well.~~

In March, I asked Nindi to make a 49er ice cream cake for my sons' 18th Birthday...it was amazing...I have never had ice cream as yummy as Scooptacular, and look forward to going as often as possible.   By the way, the ice cream cake was a hit, and there wasn't much left after we cut into it! Thanks Nindi for making it a memorable and wonderful 18th Birthday!

Debbie made a gorgeous gift for my husband. I urge you to avoid over priced jewelers and go to Debbie for your unique jewelry.

For the best cupcakes, cakes, dessert...Pixy Cakes is the bakery for this family. Tina made our sons cupcakes for his 18th birthday, they were amazing!  She made our daughters cupcakes for her 14th birthday; too!  I won't go anywhere else, ever!

Great cupcakes, great atmosphere, wonderful place to get fantastic desserts...  The cupcakes are made fresh daily, and ARE NOT stored out in the open, there are cupcakes displayed on tiers, but those aren't sold to the public, they are merely for display only.   There is a monitor on the wall that shows the creativity of the bakers and Tina, the owner. Many professional cake decorators, just starting out, need to develop a portfolio, and that is what these ladies are doing. They have made Treasure Chests, Dolls, Tiffany Boxes and many others... the idea is for you (if you are planning a party or wedding) to come in and tell them you vision...and they will make it happen, from Angry Birds to Princess Ariel...all you have to do is give them a chance to delight you.  Pixy Cakes is going to stay...please don't give up on Tina or her staff...this is a 16 year endeavour that has come to fruition and you won't be disappointed.  I was there for Grand Opening on 8/25 and the cupcakes were fresh, moist, GOOD.  They are not $37 a dozen, they are $29 and well worth it.
