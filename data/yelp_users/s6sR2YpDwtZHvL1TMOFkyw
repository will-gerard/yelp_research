Okay first the good news - they are really nice here, and that about sums that up.  The bad news? I got a pedicure and a gel manicure on Tuesday. They did the pedicure first and then once she was done she looks at me and tells me that they don't have the same color (royal blue) in gel. I asked her to do whatever was closest and ended up with a dark purple. It bothered me but none of my friends seemed to notice.   As for the actual manicure? She cut two cuticles so that they were bleeding, only did 2 costs of color (supposed to be 4) and you can tell! She also did not buff my nails so the gel started peeling by Friday (which was the day I needed them). Also, when I got home Tuesday I realized that the gem on my left big toe was completely out of place, it also fell of by Thursday.  Basically: this is the worst mani/pedi I've ever received. As nice as they are - I won't be back.

Omg That Pumpkin Curry is ah-mazing! The amount they delivered to me has made 5 meals for me (the actual curry of course not the rice), five oh-so-delicioso meals! They do lose a star with me though because I was given a choice between a tapioca almond drink or a boba almond drink & I chose tapioca (So I was expecting the super small tapioca balls) but instead received boba, it also took them 70 minutes instead of the quoted 45-60. But I would definitely order from here again!

I really liked Plush. I took my mom here on mother's day for facials. The esthetician (I forget her name) was very sweet. She listened to what both of us wanted and personalized the treatments accordingly. I thought the price was very reasonable for service. I do have one complaint however. I had asked her to concentrate on my blackheads but she did leave a few stray ones.

I absolutely LOVE Rita's. Is my ultimate favorite dessert spot. The workers are always in such good moods and you can tell they really enjoy working there. Then again, who wouldn't!?

My cousin and I went here for the first time today. We had wanted Sprinkles but Gigi's is just down the street from my place so we decided to go ahead and check it out. We got the Margarita cupcake, chocolate salted caramel and miss princess.   The Margarita cupcake was pretty disappointing. Both my cousin and I had gotten one. It tasted more like a yellow cake with lime frosting. Not to mention that the frosting was rolled in sugar, we had assumed that out would be salt, but were displeased when we bit into it and it was sugar. The cupcake was topped with a candy lime slice that I think was tequila infused but my cousin couldn't taste it. overall: the cupcake was way too sweet, and absolutely mundane & bland tasting.

Oh, my, gosh. These cupcakes are everything. I've past this place a ridiculous amount of times, mainly because of all the glitter and the general presentation of the cupcakes seemed kind of blas√©, but oh how I regret how many times I've let that stop me from trying them.  Finally I was at the mall w/ my Dad and he offered to buy some for us. (I was not about to turn down free cupcakes!) We were both blown away.    I had the bananas foster, my Dad had the red velvet & his girlfriend had the Fox 10, all were little pieces of heaven.
