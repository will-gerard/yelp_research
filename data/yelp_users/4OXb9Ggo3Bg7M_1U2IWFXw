This place is super ghetto.  Teens pretty much take it ocer from 7 am to 9am and then all afternoon.  And if it is not the teens then it is the homeless begging for food or money! However the bright spot is this smoking hot young mexican woman named Kim. Totally a little cutie!

I've only had lunch here but now that Pugize's is closed this is the only place I order a sandwich! It's veggies seem more fresh and crisp and as always the meats are great! I love their selection of tea. In the winter I love to sit outside. They have a very nice patio. This is just a nice place to have lunch!

This place is a run down dump. I felt like l was going to get a mersa infection just sitting at the table. The food is terrible, even for lndian food. The buffet is over priced. There are some great Indian places in Phoenix and this is not one. You can just tell that they do things as cheap as possible and don't care about quality. My guess is that the chef is mexican and not lndian! Move along.

This place is the WORST. The older brunette woman behind the counter is not only incredibly rude but she an amazingly small amount of knowledge for all things shipping! I could grab any homeless person off their medication and place them behind the counter and their endless ramblings about the C.I.A. putting a chip in thier brain would make more sence then this older woman. This is the problem with the ups store no two are alike. This ups store is like a private sector version of the DMV! Steer clear!

MEH... 1st time here, had 2 chicken tacos... It's OK. Service is fast and friendly. Portions are big. The beans are a little runny. A HUGE plus is that they have NO violations with the health department. Very unusual for this type of restaurant. I wish l could give half stars, I'd do 2.5, but you live by the full star you die by the full star.  Also this place has NO broads working here.

The copy center here is amazing!!! By far the best copy center around. They are ALWAYS on time and very helpful. The boss lady is so sexy sweet... I wish one time when I went in to get my copies she would just slide me a piece of paper with an address and time... damn lady... you sexy Anyways get your office supplies here...

This place is gross. They drive down to Restaurant Deport and buy their fruits and vegetables and then drive them all the way back in their warm car. There are some great juice spots around here that actually buy quality produce and store it properly. The service is so so and you definitely don't  want to sit here and drink your unhealthy juice.

This  place USED to be a favorite of mine. IDK what happened but it really went down hill. I've been in twice in the last 30 days and both meals were not up to standard. I probably won't  be back for the food. I enjoy the OTB and the booze is still wet... so they have that going for them. I'll  just grab something to eat before l come down for poker...

I HATE this copy center. They make you email your documents to some stupid address instead of the regular store address  like the one on Tatum. Getting ANYTHING printed is an ordeal and takes WAAAAAAAY to long!! Additionally  there is a big ole broad behind the counter and she like to wield it!

Steer clear of this run down dump!!!! IDK where to start with this place. The people on United flight 93 were treated better than I was. Very SLOW service, VERY poor attitude. I can't stand bad service. If you don't want to wait tables or have to provide a service to customers go work somewhere else. I had to shave twice in betwixed refills. Also don't offer free refills and then get pissed when I drink more than one coke. Listen I'm not looking for Morton's here but the officer's club at the Four Oh Double Natural was in better shape than this place!You can tell there is no pride in ownership and that the person or persons who own this business try to get by a cheap as they can. Now hey I own a small business, I know you need to save money where you can, you just don't need to do it at the expanse of the customer. A business should thrive because of it's customers not in spite of it's customers. To see what I am talking about you only need to visit one of the other restaurants in this very strip mall. This place gives off the feeling that it is held together by popsicle sticks and chewing gum. I'm afraid that if I sneeze to hard the whole place will fall apart at the seams. It must have taken a lot of effort to make a place in a building this new look so run down. There were nicer places in Berlin at the end of ol WWII. Now on to the food. The worst part about coming to this place is having to eat at this place. I'm afraid to think of what I was really eating... I really have to wonder how Subway a few doors down can turn a profit and still use fresh bell peppers, onions and spinach and this place feels the need to use produce that was swept up off the floor after a busy lunch rush at said Subway. Again pride in ownership. The owners clearly feel that using cheap second rate ingredients is the only way to make money. It really sucks too because when you blow the dust and hair off of the menu they have some things that sound really really tasty. The price also makes you feel like you are in for a treat. The Pièce de résistance of this meal would be the hour I spent getting to know my toilet. I spent the first 20 minutes forcing out what resembled a can of Campbell's condensed cream of mushroom soup followed by what I can only describe as 40 minutes of dirty sock water.

The problem with this place is that they are the only pizza place around and they know it. Food is fair to midland... salad was not the freshest... wings were alright... and the cheese from the pizza made it greasy. I just out that greasy pizza is caused by cheap cheese. But like I said around here it's them or nothing so suck it up buttercup.

This place is has really gone down hill. Business is so bad that they have been forced to raise their rates. Their counters are over run with chotskies and the place looks to be in a complete state of disrepair. The service has really dropped off as well. I have been driving out to the 17 for my copy and shipping needs. It's  a shame what happened to this place.

This place has really gone down hill in the last few years. Stopped in tonight 1/17 and was told over a hour wait. So we waited and waited and waited some more.  Then we finally got seated and waited some more! Then l finally got up and asked for a server. When she came to the table she was very pissy. She didn't refill the drinks and the food took FOREVER!!! We won't be back and it's a shame because this placr used to be awesome!

Yeah, meh. MEH! The steaks are par for this course! Outback, Black Angus quality. Sides are ok as well. The rolls however shine! Shine on you crazy rolls, shine on!!! They are sooooo good. You can watch them make them while you wait for your table! And wait you will!!! Even if you call ahead you will wait!!! The other plus is you can throw your peanut shells on the floor. . . just like a regular saw-dust on the floor whore house! The reason this place gets the 2 stars and not 3 or the elusive 3.5 is the salad! Twice, that's right I said it, TWICE now I've gotten a salad with bad lettuce. Gross lettuce. Lettuce past the prime of it's life! Not knowing or caring that the best days are behind him now. Just clinging to the chance to be someone's salad.  What I'm trying to say is that the lettuce on my salad was bad. Both times the server said "We've been getting bad lettuce lately." It must happen often because they have a whole little spiel about it. 2nd time I asked for the manager and some 'ol boy named Garrett (He looked like a Garrett too!) saddled up and gave me the Manager's Special of the same story I just heard!!!! People. . . How hard is it to find good lettuce?!?!?

This is a great little place! This is the kind of diner that most places in the valley wish they could be!!! The food has FLAVOR! The staff is FUN!!! The other customers are nice! Yea there are a few cops that go there, however I've never seen a cop put food down. Even if there was a 211 in progress!!! You'd never think of looking for this place and I drove past it TWICE when I WAS looking for it!!! This is truly a hidden gem!!! It is just a good diner that brings all of what a good diner should be together nicely!!!!!  BTW yourself a favor and try the BLT!!!

The owner of this run down dump is a little Oompa Loompa looking guy with a giant inferiority complex. This place is the bait and switch masters. Pay cash and don't trust this little guy with your credit card. In fact just avoid the headache and side step the little fella all together!

I was here Friday May 9th 2014. This is one of those place you can tell from the moment you walk in the door has a very cheap owner who takes no pride in ownership. From the old cracked celling tiles to the cheap art on the walls to the food (more on that later) to the old cheap broken down equipment behind the counter. The bathroom was gross dirty and smelled terrible! It's a seat yourself type of place so we saunter over to a booth and wait for someone to come check on us. 5 minutes go by and no one has check on us. So I walk up to the cash register and ask if we could get some service and I get a major attitude from the lady sitting back there. Before I could get back to my seat a nice woman was dropping off menus and taking our drink orders and saying how sorry she was about the delay. Fair enough things happen and she was very friendly! I order a coke and water with lemon and my friend orders an iced tea with lemon. When we get our drinks the 1st thing we both notice is the brown spots on the lemons. When we ask about fresh lemons she says they all pretty much look like that. So my friend ordered the burger and the waitress asked if he wanted French fries and he said yes. I ordered the grilled salmon with a salad fries and veggis. When the waitress brought me my salad I though it was a joke. GROSS GROSS GROSS! The lettuce was wilted and the tomato looked freeze dried. I could not believe that this was what passed for a salad around this place!!!! I mean the lettuce was seriously BROWN!!! UGH! I ask if they maybe had something fresher and she said that this is how the lettuce looked! OMG! REALLY?!?!? God I still can't believe it! So here comes our meal. My salmon was dry and bland! My friends was about on par with one you'd get from McDonalds. Nothing real bad just not something homemade. Then the bill comes. There was a charge for my friends fries. Who the hell sells a hamburger A la carte? So over all we were not impressed with any of it! The waitress was friendly and kept our drinks refilled so that was good. It's just one of those places you can tell the owner wants to do things as cheap a possible and is not worried about quality! I really hate to say this because I love to support local businesses but just do yourself a favor and go to the Denny's on Grand.

I have a love hate relationship with this place. I hate the service and how the place is always messy. I hate that the teenagers behind the counter can screw up my order when I'm telling them what l want. I hate that workers are always standing around when there is a long line. I love that l can help myself to milk. I love that l can take 2 or 3 vitamin waters without paying.  I love l can keep going back for more chips and no one notices.

I won't be back. They completely chaned the format of a document I emailed them to print so instead of it being 20 pages it was 40. On top of that they charged me a $4 computer usage fee???? I email documents to UPS stores all the time and NEVER have I been charged a fee. I guess they have enough Snow Birds that they don't feel the need to take care of anyone under 50. There are too many other stores in the area.  I won't be back!

UPS stores are inherently flawed because each store is free to do whatever they want. This location is a perfect example. Every Monday I've been emailing documents that I need copies of to this store. And every Monday the old lady behind the counter prints me 50-100 copies charges me .10 or so a copy and sends me on my way. This Monday she decides to charge me some sort of $2.50 internet charge. This is a problem at all UPS stores, you never know what they are going to charge you for. It's one of the main reasons I use Staples. The other problem the old lady behind the counter is slow and rude. If she has more than one person in the store she gets overwhelmed and all flustered! She is not good with technology and is always mumbling under her breath.  It seems like having to print my copies is more trouble that it's worth for her. I won't be back...

This place is what I'm talking about! The food is hand made and it shows. The hamburgers are awesome! The consistency is great! The servers are really good and the booze just flows. They also have the NFL ticket so that rocks! This is what a sports bar should be like.

I don't  come here in the summer because of the way I'm treated in the winter. Snowbirds and Bluehairs take this place over, especially on Monday  and Tuesday for the cheap spaghetti... The service  really takes a hit when they are busy. However the Sarah Palin looking waitress does a good job... if she is still here. I haven't  been here in over a year. The other thing l REALLY dislike is that they don't have a sling for my baby... really?! Spend $100 and buy some slings already!   The food is good for $6.99 spaghetti and meatballs. The bread is definitely above average and the highlight of the meal. I've never tried anything else and only come here when someone else suggests it. There are other Italian restaurants around, try them.

I'm not sure what happenedto this place. Over the last 2 months they have not been as good as my previous experiences. The food is definitely not as good. The service is still above average, but the food has definitely taken a hit. I would classify them as a Filibertos with a wait staff... There are a couple of really good choices in Surprise for Mexican food. I'll be crossing this one off that list.

This place is sad! If you're looking for food in Westgate just go somewhere else. The Lettuce is wilted!!! This place is a bar that serves bar food. They are more worried about selling booze... Not a bad place if you are looking for a typical overpriced place to have a drink. Long story short I doubt they make it through the summer. I wish it would just close down so they can get some place good in their spot.

Here's the deal. If you own a restaurant and shop here you're an idiot. The time you spend puttering around in this place doesn't equal savings. Their prices on same items are noy that much cheaper. If you have a good relationship with your broadliner and use a produce house you'll save money in the long run...  This place is primarily people that have burnwd every bridge in town. If your time is worth nothing have at it.

Hands down the best part of this place is the hot ass latinas behind the counter. The service is terrible and all they donis chat with each other but god damnit they are fine!!!

Meh, This reminds me of the place my Granddad had breakfast at with his friends back in Nebraska. It's not very good. However the people there don't go there for the food. They go there to meet their friends, and they go there because they don't know any better. Bland food, so so service,Don is a GROUCH and the place is only half clean.  This is the perfect place to go if you are 60+ and just want to talk to people your age.  I won't be back and that won't affect or effect the bottom line of this place Don is happy with the retiree crowd and they are happy with the same no frills no surprise bland food they've had for 40 years!!!

UGH! Typical diner and not in a good way. The problem with this place is that it's never the same. If Costco has bacon on sale she's buying it from Costco. If Restaurant Depot has it on sale she's driving all the way down there. Biscuits Cafe is so good because it's ALWAYS the same. This lady just buys the cheapest and it shows!!! I won't be back!

Meh, is right! It's a cool idea. And let me tell you this partner, I can dig on some mushrooms! Portobellos were nice size. Everything is cool and the gang there! However when it comes to the button dish it was like they had a mix and match sale at the mushroom store! I don't want to sound like Goldie Locks but 1 was very big 1 was ok and 1 was teency. I know that no 2 shrooms are the same BUT they were not is the same ballpark. I asked my server what was the scoop and she said they have been having trouble getting the same size mushrooms!!! REALLY?!!?! How does a mushroom bar not know where to get good mushrooms?!????!?!??!? That seems like an easy problem to fix!!! Anywhoo It is a neat idea just needs some fine tuning! Call me when you find better mushrooms!!!

I saw these folks at Flavors of the West in Litchfield and it looked like maybe they had turned it around. So like I said last time I can get down on the mushrooms. I really want this place to get it right because I live in the north west valley and don't want to drive all the way over to Mellow Mushrooms. However it seems things have gone from bad to worse at this place. Sad. The Portobellos were now smaller than the 1st time I ate there and a LOT smaller than they were at Flavors of the West. Now I know you bring your A game and stack the deck in your favor at a rodeo like Flavors of the west but this was night and day. Same goes with the buttons. Also I noticed that the romaine seemed a little past its EXP date. Over all the food was good but for the money I am spending I expect to leave full. I don't think that is unreasonable. They have some pretty good wine and dine deals but I don't feel it's worth it. I guess for now I'm heading over to Mellow Mushroom OR next door to Oggi's for a large with extra mushrooms. Too bad for me...

Son! Where do I start? This place is sonice, and everyoneknows that is better than so nice! Fresh fresh fresh! You can tell they make it there and not from a can! I've been going for awhile now and it seems things have gotten better in the last month or so! I'm telling you now that you need to try it! All the flavors just come together so nice! The only thing keeps me from going more is the drive! Open one in Surprise already!

This is the worst type of place! 1st of all it's in a strip mall so you know 6 months from now it will be a T-Mobile. 2nd of all the staff is RUDE! I asked what kid if cheese they offered and they elderly lady behind the counter seemed very upset that I was even there ordering. The walls and floors were not clean my table needed to be wiped down and I had to ask twice before it was cleaned. It took forever to get my food and they were not that busy. Some old man and young guy were fighting so loud in the back room I could hear them at my table. They offer free refills on drinks but you have to go back to the counter to get it and they act mad that you want a refil. 3rd the food. Average at best. I was so hoping the burgers would be good. The bun was nice. But the lettuce was turing brown and the tomatoe was soggy. The patty itself was dry and over cooked. I also ordered zuchinni sticks and they were ok. They chop them long ways and bread them but one was not cooked all they way. Surprise needs a good burger joint and this is not it.

I've only had copies made here, so idk about the rest of their services, however I can tell you the copy machine is the worst. It leaves a black line down the left side of the page on every copy. I use these copies for work and need them to look semi professional. I always try to support locally owned small businesses like thisone it's a shame I can't!

This place is  hit or miss. And today they missed... The last 2 times I've been in here  they had to 86 a couple of items.  Today they were out of fries... they have amazing parmesan fries... how can a burger place be out of fries?!?! And l guess they only have  1 waitress today? The service is really slow, but this poor lady is running around like crazy. I feel bad for her.  Plus this is a sports bar, where is the 20 something hot chix l can stare at inappropriately?!!? 2 stars today, 3 on a good day.

Fairly cute Asian lady was the hostess and waitress.  Place was pretty dead. Just me and a mother of 2 who ordered a Coors Light and Saki bomb at 1 in the afternoon.  The lunch special is a good deal and the quality of the food is haymazing! I will definitely be back here to get my sushi fix!

What sucks about this place is that it could be SO AWESOME if they got their act together. It seems like EVERY TIME I go there the staff screws something up. My latest example was tonight when I wanted to play laser tag. We called ahead and said all systems were go. Then we show up and they say it is closed for a private party? The bowling is expensive. There is nothing special about it to justify the higher price. What sucks is that they know they don't have to provide good service because they are the only game in town. Oh well...

Not surprised this placed closed. Service was terrible and the owners had no knowledge of what they were doing. I got the feeling they lost their house and sunk their life savings into this venture and were very sour about the situation towards the end. I know they were so upside-down in their house that they were forced to sell it without a realtor. I'm sorry this happened but these people were just not business people.

This the worst type of place.... I've eaten here about 4 or 5 times now and it is never the same. IDK if they have no recipes or they never buy their stuff at the same place but it always is different. Today we got the same as we always do,  large 1/2 mushrooms 1/2 sausage and it was 10x better than last time. Whatever they did this time they need to do it again.

This place is the WORST!  The service is terrible!!! The owner, an old man, who needs to remember he is in the SERVICE industry. He has NO issue yelling at staff in front of customers. It makes it very uncomfortable...my daughter actually asked why he was being so rude! The food was nothing special. My wife had the sun-dried tomato, goat cheese & pine nuts omelette, pretty Plain Jane. I had the same problem with the asparagus, ham & gruyere crepes. I'm sure he is just using a Swiss cheese and not a true gruyere. This is the type of guy who seems more worried about prices than quality. My daughter did enjoy her chocolate chip pancakes.  I saw the menu online and thought this place might be a delicious change. It was not. Again, I'm sure that quality is 2nd behind price when this guy does his food buying! We won't be back. We will be going across the street to the U.S. Egg. They at least have an attentive wait staff and FRIENDLY owners!!!
