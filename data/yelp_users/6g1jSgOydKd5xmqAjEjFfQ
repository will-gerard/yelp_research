First of all there was only two people working in this bank and there was only one other person in there with me and yet I do not understand why there is a waiting list just to see the banker. Customer service was bad, they take forever to do one simple transaction. Save yourself sometimes and go to a different branch.

Friendly Walgreen with staff that will go out of their way to help you find what you need. I was in a hurry and they helped me out and will come back here from now on. Will recommend to friends and family. A friendly place is always worth visiting.

Not very good costumer service, came in and got the wrong hookah e-liquid and came back for exchange and they will not accept it. It's a simple mistake and easy fix but they will not help out, not recommended.

In a neighborhood where there isn't much around beside a small complex with a few restaurants but mostly fast food. Their price are awesome, clean store and friendly staff who are always happy to help you with anything. Got anything you need here but I is more toward business items and wholesale products. Come here often and will recommend.

They're very friendly and more than happy to help you with anything you need but is not just because it's their job, it's pricy but worth the money. Weather it's getting start with a new home or just wanted to make some changes and upgrade furnitures, this is the place to check out. Recommended. Will be backs

Stop by to get a sundae as walk in there wasn't anyone there until we said hello then the employee came out, the place isn't clean, they use to be better and been here for awhile, but I guess things change. But it's okay if you just want to grab something to eat really quick and leave.

I came in a little late almost toward closing so I ordered take out, got the pad thai noodle with tofu. Friendly employees, got water while waiting and the wait was alright not too long. Pretty big restaurant with over ten tables. Will come early next time to check out what else they have and stay to eat.
