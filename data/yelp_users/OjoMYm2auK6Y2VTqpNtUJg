WOW!   A little taken back by the last two reviews I just read as my experience here is quite different.   I am a long time regular at this location, popping in about twice monthly for the past three years.   When I come into the store, many of the floor staff great me with a hello and JESSICA always says hello to me by name!  When I drop off in the back at intake OLLA and CHRISTINE are usually there to welcome me and take in my items.   They always ask how my week is going, how my daughter is and are caring individuals.   If the wait is going to be out of the ordinary or unusually long they let me know!   In the Mens side (Well Suited) LYNN and KATHRYN are always there to greet me and always by name before i can even say hello to them!!!  Today they pointed out some great new ties that had just come in!  **FIVE STARS** MSC Pima is my favorite store location to shop!  It is always clean and organized and the people there are willing to help!

I have been here twice.  The 2nd time not much better than the first.  (Lucky we even came back after the first disaster). Manager on duty both times checked in with tables and parties all around us but never stopped to check on us.  It was apparent management only talks to people they know and are not interested in welcoming or getting feedback from new customers!   Drinks went empty.  When we ordered replacement beers for the table only one was brought.  Salad was just okay. Nothing special for the money -  I don't think We will be giving his place a third try.
