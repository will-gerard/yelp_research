INCREDIBLE! Naam yoga is an experience that cannot be described justly. You have to literally experience it. It is so emotionally healing and fun. The studio is lovely and inviting. I practice yoga all over the east valley and this is my one of my top favorites. I've practiced Naam in Los Angeles also. Nicole is still my most favorite instructor! You will not regret it! I'm so happy Naam is here.... Thank you! Namaste

First I'll say the decor is the best part of the restaurant.  Unfortunately the decor also set a high expectation for the food, which was alright.  It was overpriced.  I've had a couple salads, and a sandwich.  The sandwich was bland, bread not that great.  The Kale salad was understated, the dressing great but not much else.  The other two times I went my order was wrong both times with the salads.  I've decided I'm done with Modern Grove

The food is consistently EXCELLENT!  My husband and I appreciate extra effort from the chef who makes all the food fresh. Never microwaved, from bags or processed.  The steak medallions literally melt in our mouths. And we always finish a meal with a crepe. If you like crepes this is THE PLACE! We're here once a week (sometimes more!) thank you Orchard Eats for having an amazing restaurant!
