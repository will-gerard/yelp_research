Three of us that ordered the seasonal sunfish special all agreed it was excellent!  Husband and I split the small Sanora? salad (had figs, apples) and the sunfish and it was a perfect amount.  Our group ordered 4 different desserts (brownie, creme brulee, cannoli, and tiramisu) and the tiramisu was our favorite- one of the best I've ever had! Did not really care for the cannoli.

My father has been a patient at Tri-City for years & should have left a long time ago. I can't even begin to list the number of times that the doctors and staff have dropped the ball with or been incompetent his care. If you are considering Tri-City for your heart care, you deserve better.

Beautiful resort with great amenities. Amazing staff & customer service. We stayed here for our anniversary and the staff helped make this a very memorable getaway. There was a complimentary chocolate & fruit plate waiting for us in our room. We got upgraded to a room with better view for no extra cost. Had a great dinner at Prado restaurant and enjoyed a relaxing afternoon poolside at the adults-only pool.
