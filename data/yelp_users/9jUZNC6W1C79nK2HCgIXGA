Facility: 3.5  Group Fitness: 0  Seriously, if I could give this gym a zero, I would. Of course, my negative experience is only because of its garbage quality (yes-garbage) fitness classes. Have they ever heard of in-stru*cto/r cert#ification????? I figured out how they cut corners. it's simple. They cut all the really good instructors that take fitness seriously, and replace them with either wannabes or old retired women that are looking to fill up their time (I do not have a problem with old retired people btw but if I'm going to the gym, I better sweat! And that's not even that hard) Every class I've been to, the instructors obviously know nothing about toning, strength, or cardio. A little rhythm wouldn't be so bad either.... The instructors show up LATE.... or they don't show up at all. This gym only cares about its numbers. This goes for all locations.   My motto: G.I.G.O. Garbage in =Garbage Out.

Where does one go to escape the working man's district and the monotonous 9-5? Crackers. The menu is fan. Friggin. Tastic. I always get the Roma tomato melt sandwhich. But everything is always good. The soup. The breakfast is good too. very popular at lunch time though.   You come with a hearty appetite and you leave with a hearty-full tummy!

This is my go-to for Korean food. No place will I venture off to in search of a home cooked bowl of kimchee chigae. I would rather go to an actual sushi place for sushi but this place is the bomb.  Reasonable lunch specials during the week Their kimbab is the best The owner (Richard) is super nice and always personable  Multiple locations! Everybody can be happy now!

1. Awesome job in ambiance and location 2. excellent service 3. Menu variety  This place is a diamond in rough. It's got class and appeals to a variety of appetites, tucked away in the heart of downtown Tempe (party central), yet it's got a private feel or rural-ness. It's a little expensive, however, I've been known to turn the other cheek with price/value issues, when bribed with good hospitality, a memorable experience, and good coffee :)  The fire place is a nice touch.

This place kicks ass. Kudos for the buffet and various assortments in baklava!  Perfectly cooked gyro meat, however their hummus is typically overblended to the point of pure cream. BUT that didn't kill my appetite or anything. Great value for the $$, they are very generous with portion size. I love this place. And it's not overly popular (read: crowded) as other places. I would totally recommend this for lunch hour, a quick takeout for movie night, or dinner. I am looking forward to my next visit here.

I was soooo looking forward to this place. It's got great curb appeal. But I had a horrible experience.    ....IT STARTED AND ENDED WITH THE COCKROACH IN MY FOOD. I'm not lying. Makes me question their best practices in the kitchen... I gave it 2 stars because the food wasn't particularly bad (what they replaced it with)... and things happen. I know, but. Still...

"Mahalo!"   Ahhh.... the calm my soul feels when I walk into this place and hear local words that welcome me back to the island. This place beats out ono's on their katsu hands down. Their Mac salad is always on point with l&l Mac salad even on the island. My typical order involves lau lau but because they had to raise their  prices to nearly $12 a plate, I'm afraid I will have to settle for a mini plate.    For first timers, get the chicken katsu. Or teriyaki (BBQ) chicken. I never liked the short ribs (Hawaiian style).

OMG why aren't there more reviews for this awesome place? The pizza is fresh, and has tasty ingredients, and for the value you cold order 2 pizzas and be fine for the week to live off of. This place rocks. Great concept.

Are Koreans really giving this a half decent review? NO. Because it kinda blows.  On Service-food and beverage is not a natural skill, but it would be good if they trained their staff to be more attentive (and friendly)  The food: Poor representation of real Korean food.what Korean place doesn't have kimbab outside of the lunch menu? When I went here it was considered only on the lunch menu and way overpriced and wasn't even that good. Wtf??? Their panjan is not fresh. Not to mention that they are stingy with it. The deji bulgogi (spicy pork) was not at all good and their kalbi was very fatty.  I honestly think this place is good for people who think they know Korean food (who really don't) because their friend's friend was Korean or something but most Korean loving hungry souls will go straight to Takamatsu.

What I love most about this place is:  1. Pesto Chicken pasta 2. Portion sizes are big 3. Endless samples of their bread of the day    I've told people this before, that I'm a true 'bread person' through and through. You don't know what that means? It means that I tend to get full off the complimentary bread before my meal even makes it to the table. There's just something about bread+butter.... mmm..   ANYWAY, this is a nice "let's talk over lunch" or "read my book over lunch" kinda place. Definitely a bistro meets internet cafe tone. Perfect ambiance for a lunch date, a working lunch, or a hungry bite if you're getting your tires rotated next door. It's not really an "in and out", as it takes a while to get your order but you can kill time here easily.

This place is like a breath of fresh air tucked away in the land of Agritopia of Gilbert. I love this place mainly for its:  1. Picnic tables outside 2. Its a perfect place to take an informal date, kids night out, or solo 3. The menu has some variety although the burgers are its main staple 4. Its got a coffee shop, bistro right next door. It's a completely different yet the same vibe. The younger folk generally hang out here. Great coffee. 5. They appreciate our country's VETS! On Vet appreciation night :-)

Do yourself a favor and bookmark this place.  I love Palee's Crown and if you've seen my past reviews, you'd know I'm a tough cookie to please. I've had my fair share of Pad Thai and Spicy Basil garlic chicken and I must say that this is by far the best. No pad thai is EVER created equal, there is just no such thing. Restaurants typically have their own version of pad thai (albeit very similar, some are more saucy while other are more dry) but this one suits my palette the best, with just the right balance of tamarind and fish sauce to make a yummy saucy base. I stumbled upon this place after denouncing Benjarong as one of my favs ever since it went through what seemed like an eternity of renovations, I just gave up.... But that's another story.   When I want quality thai, Palee's is it. I'm the only "ethnic" one in my office so introducing my coworkers to new foods is a challenge. Of all the Thai places I've taken them to, they always vote for PC. And whenever my mom is in town she ALWAYS wants to go to PC.  There's just too many things to like about this place. For one, aside from the quality, the location is good since it's located in close proximity to a lot of businesses (hotels, the fiesta mall, etc). Second, the quality is excellent. Third, the price is competitive and on par with a lot of local thai joints in the area.   ......And last but surely not the least, did I mention the cute and friendly hostesses/servers? Seriously, it's like watching an episode of Cheers every time I come here, "sometimes you want to go, where everybody knows your name"!  Great customer service!    And to everyone who is rating this place as a $$ instead of a $.... WTH are you  ordering? Lunch plates are usually $8 while the standard size is no more than $10 per person.

I don't know know what it is about this place but the way it's built makes it very hard to have a conversation, in every corner of the bar. It's just very LOUD. I'm not a beer drinker, but I am a social drinker, regardless. Their chicken nachos are good, probably the best thing on the menu (although I would pick Four Peaks chicken nachos any day).   4 stars for excellent location, and social scene.

The K.I.S.S. Review:  Pros: -good quality grade SUSHI, the truest I've tasted in all the valley -portion size -good variety in happy hour & reverse happy hour menu -good ambiance and social scene -good location  Cons: -poor replicas of some "Asian" dishes (evident in the tonkatsu and Korean Kalbi) -price vs value   If you've heard that this place is expensive, you heard right. HOWEVER, you just need to know what to order and decide if it's worth it. My favorite rolls that I'm always willing to pay top dollar for are:  Lotus on Fire roll Lotus roll Volcano   I'm accustomed to sushi in HAWAII, and I've got to say their spicy tuna is on pay with the island. That being said, those are probably the only items on the menu that I splurge on, hence why those are the ONLY things I get when I go there. Soo yummy. Happy hour is the bomb.

Review is overdue, but this place is awesome for BRUNCH. The food is ok, but the bottomless mimosas are a nice touch. Nice for an intimate yet friendly setting for a good price.   Favorite dish: Breakfast Tostada   Although I've heard.... not so good reviews about their dinner menu. Apparently the value goes way down for the $$

This place has something for everyone. Their bruschetta is to die for. try the sampler. You'll see what I mean. The shrimp bisque (I think) is good too. I don't remember what I had here but I just remember my meal being quite pleasant.

A few things one should expect when coming NOCA:  -you will never be thirsty, waterboy is there stalking empty glasses like a hawk -the pasta is not at all impressive -cotton candy is complimentary and served at the end of the meal -this is "casual fine dining" = large rimmed, heavy expensive ass plates with dallop of *insert food here* -great venue for a date -menu changes NIGHTLY  Dim lighting,  small cozy atmosphere, but not excessively loud either. Reminds me of a sophisticated restaurant in a place like NY city. While the food will come in sample size portions, the flavor is packing. They had this braised pork with some kind of cheese that was just.... I mean, who wudda thought that'd be like dynomite in your mouth? However. Stay away from pasta. You can get that anywhere.     Whatever you don't do, make sure you DO get the salted butter gelato. O. M. F. G.

It's either a really good or bad thing when I feel I have to turn to Yelp IMMEDIATELY after eating somewhere..... I just ate there like literally 10 minutes ago and I could see how this would appeal to the masses that have given this place a decent rating, however, this place? Typical college town business that skimps on portion size but most college students won't care because they're usual starving college students. But I can name numerous places that serve more on a plate of hummus than this hole in the wall!   Their plates are $9.75 a piece and light in weight to say the least. Both the red bell pepper hummus and jalepeno hummus were lacking flavor (and not spicy) and the meat was dry as hell. Rice was undercooked. Baklava was old and soggy and lacking that crunchiness and nuttiness that true baklava is known for.   I will not be returning here for a Greek fix. There's no point. No value. No flavor. And definitely not authentic.  If you want Greek, PITA JUNGLE, MEDITERRANEAN GRILL OR FLAMING KABOB is where its at (and cheaper).   POST 1 HOUR UPDATE: I just got home and had to yack it all. I am officially sick off of this food.

I'm a local, but this was my first time here.   PRO: Ambiance is a major plus (live music will have that effect on you). Very 'chillaxing. During the day, the view is just beautiful. You can see all of fountain hills below the patio, and the backdrop is what most Arizonans will be proud for--the breathtaking view. The food is pretty good, not overly proportioned but just satisfying in appetite.    CON: the service takes FOREVER. You're lucky if you get your food within 20 mins of ordering. And I mean at every part of my dining experience, this place is slow. The time it took for me to get my food was  long, the time it took to get a refill was extra long, and the time it took for them to bring out the check (let alone getting back your credit card), makes it not even worth it.   in summary, I'd go here if I wanted to casually impress a group of friends for a good value, but be prepared to wait.

exactly.... me thinks NOT.  The photos of this place are highly misrepresentative of the reality of this nail DIVE.   I bought  facial GROUPON for my hubby's bday as a nice little treat since he loves getting facials. What did I have him walk into that day for his 2pm appointment? An empty bizarre-like swap meet of a nail salon. The facial area was not set up in a private room or anything it was right by the nail stations. Which were set up right next to the jewelry station.... Which was then set up next to plants for sale station. For real. So while you're getting your face pampered they let nail shavings and acrylic clippings re-enter your skin? W.t.f.    Anyway, he arrived 10 minutes early and yes, maybe they were busy even if it wasn't obvious. The rude lady told him to wait. But then 2:10 rolls by and they're still empty, yet busy?? Time is money, ok? They clearly state that their is no rescheduling appointments so we were prepared to surrender the Groupon.    But then... at 2:45 the owner calls him and says "you can come back if you want?" As if they just realized he had walked out to take a smoke break? You're crazy for coming here in the first place!

4 stars for the greatest fullness my tummy feels just after finishing a sampler ($8.75) with the following items:  2 (big) empanadas de carne Croquetas de jamon  Mashed potato balls   Mmmmm mmmm mmm.  The tostones are usually hit or miss. I prefer mine with just the right balance of crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. I think depending on how old their grease is it will vary the taste.   Anyway. The bread. The butter.  OMG. Good.  The bistec is just alright. But the Cuban sandwhich is good :)

Quick and dirty, I think this place is far better than Dirty Pretty or PCL in Scottsdale. For one I love the uh.... diversity? It's got a diverse age group which I was very surprised by but it wasn't an unwelcomed one since there were still plenty of young folk. What I like when I go here is its location, you really forget you're in the desert when you're here but step outside and you'll be thankful you are (in the desert).   I love: the club ambiance, grade A Awesome DJ, I mean this in the best way possible, he really keeps the ball rolling the concept of gogo dancers the on point security (they are patrolling the floor for any riff raff) the gorgeous view on the patio (a very nice breath of fresh air when you can snag one unless the smokers beat you to it) abundant parking (should you be prepared for a tiny walk)  I hate: the poor fact that these "gogo dancers" need a lesson in dancing 101, I've been tempted to get up there myself and show them how it's done Some of the VIP douchebags actually try to make it rain.... no-no the bartenders are not very friendly but who gives a ****? drinks.... $$$.... wtf?

I just left this place after a fantastic pedicure and gel mani. The pedi experience is phenomenal. Hot stone massages that are extra long is the standard here and it's the same price of a normal pedicure! Unbelievable. The place is very clean, I might add. Most places wreak of acrylic fumes but they keep acrylic workstations separate am enclosed from the main room.   This place is 5 stars in my book. Highly recommend!!!
