This is definitely the place for a quick bite to eat. I love their garnish and salsa bar and I can honestly say I had the best carne asada tacos in downtown Phoenix! Everything was Cheap, fast, and delicious. I am definitely going to frequent this place.

I've been trying to let this go. I really didn't want to do this to Harley's but it's been weeks and I still can't get over it.  My girlfriend and I went in on a Sunday night and it was moderately busy. Upon entering we were told that it would be a "bit of A wait for food" since they were short staffed in the kitchen. Fine we were in no rush. We waited and decided to order drinks. Waited about 20 min for a drink order. Ok cool. I got a Moscow Mule. It tasted funny so I sent it back, to which the bartender replies, "oh! I didn't have ginger beer so I tried to make my own recipe but you noticed". ?!? Ok fine whatevs just give me a house glass of red. About an hour into sitting down we order our meal. I order linguini and clams and my gf orders ravioli. We wait another HOUR and TWENTY min. We get our food and I don't even know what to do at this point. I can not even describe what my meal looked and tasted like. I guess... The most accurate way to describe it was as if a child was combing the beach and picked up 8 or 9 dried up baby clam shells and threw them into a bowl of boiled linguini... This might be an understatement. After trying to doctor it up myself I just couldn't handle it so I sent it back. Here is where I get utterly annoyed. The hostess/waitress Insists... INSISTS!! I let them Remake it just to "let them know what I think". I said fine. IF YOU INSIST. when the food comes back our home alarm went off and we immediately asked for the check. It was $80. For a salty as hell caprese (which I forgot to mention, nor which my left foot couldn't mess up) three drinks, one plate of "edible" ravioli and a dish we were INSISTED on retrying.  Btw, another table got fed up with waiting and walked out. We should've walked out as well. I felt bad and we tried to be oh so patient. I understand bad nights happen. I was in the food service industry for 10 years. I get it. But this was a terrible night. I don't think we will ever be back and it's sad because it came highly recommended. And what's worse... Even the "good" meal tasted generic. :( boo.

Awesome pet food store. They carry grain free foods for dogs and cats and awesome natural treats!  They also have an anesthesia free dental cleaning once a month and vaccine days to keep your pets healthy! I've been coming here for two years now and just love it. Prices are fair staff is always friendly and helpful and never pushy.

I am super unimpressed.  To start, they have managed to mash in as many pedi chairs as they can squeeze into the tiny place. Then I sit to soak in the tub for at least 15 min before anyone starts me.   My nail tech was not good at scrubbing, filing, cleaning etc.  When I asked for a simple design, instead of just telling me she couldn't do it on my toes she tells me she doesn't have an orange polish in the salon. Ok????  I was just looking at your colors and there are at least four different orange polishes.   I was trying to get a cute pedi before my trip to Hawaii and I just left disappointed. Wtf ever. Not coming back.

How can I explain my experience? If You could imagine massage, acupressure, yoga and mediation all rolled into John's hands, that's all I can say.   I am a hairdresser and have been aching in pain from the tightness I've been feeling in my neck and back. John is the first to ever give me any kind of relief! What can I say? This was such a great experience and I'm truly looking forward to an ongoing commitment with John as my therapist.   He is unconventional but very experienced and knowledgeable; I wasn't put off by his approach or methods and felt extremely relaxed and refreshed afterwards! THANK YOU, AGAIN! See you next week, John!   *Btw, prices are right on par for what he offers and the studio is clean, relaxing and very serene.

Reasonable pricing, convenient with compassionate and knowledgeable staff... Excellent experience so far. And it's so close to our place!   Dr. Hansen is super friendly and very thorough. She didn't leave me with any questions. I love that!   We have two cats and a dog so finding a good vet was important. I'm glad to have them here.

I saw Dan for a deep relaxation session. He was awesome!  I am a naturally tense person and after my first visit I felt much more relaxed.   I will say, you have to go in there with an open mind. His technique is different but not at all creepy or anything.   His prices are very reasonable and he was right on time!  I will definitely be back.   I also want to check out the health store. I didn't have time but it looked like it had a full stock on anything I might need in the homeopathic area.   Bonus that its across the street from my place!

I went a few months back and am really wanting to get back there. The dishes are unique and new and everything was delicious.   I ordered a special.  It was a seafood broth that was loaded with charred octopus, potatoes, mussels and veggies. It was amazing.   The katsu is great! Such a simple and overdone Asian dish that becomes new again with the freshest ingredients and house made sauces.   Great beer selection too. I didn't get to try a cocktail but I will next time.   Also, the banh mi and ramen are next on my list. I can't wait.   Pricing was on point, portions are definitely reasonable and atmosphere is an A+

Yay! So glad we found a new neighborhood Thai place we could get takeout from. Food was delicious and portions great for sharing. I'm sure we will quickly become regulars.
