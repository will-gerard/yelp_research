My husband and I decided to try something different for Valentine's Day, so went here last night. Wow what a mistake. First of all we had a reservations and waited an extra 20 min just to be seated. After being seated at one of their private booths (not a good idea if you are claustrophobic), I put my hand into something gross and sticky on the seat.  I couldn't help but notice the old decor,  the place looks like it's falling apart, and it has a funny smell. The cheese fondue was ok.... The girl took it away while I was still working on it, and replaced it with the meat plate. The shrimp tasted like it had freezer burn on it and was definitely not fresh. I ate a few of the scallops and was just hoping I wouldn't  get food poisoning. The desert plate was decent. It had some cheesecake that seemed like it was sitting outside for a while and one of the strawberries had gone bad. I'd normally not say anything but if we are paying 99 per person with a tip of 40 put on their by them.... I'm going to say something! Our bill came out to 250, and it awesome because they do have a spot for an additional tip if you'd like .  I wish we had gone to a nice steak house instead of this.... Trust me it's not worth it and you'll leave hungry!  Btw Marie is really great and responding to bad reviews, yet she does absolutely nothing to fix the problem! We saw a lot of people there that felt the same way we did!

Recently I had the need of Brian and his expert services.  I can not say enough about him as a professional in the wood flooring business but also as a good and honest man.  It only takes a few minutes talking to him to see how well he knows his business.  It really is great to work with someone as knowledgable as Bryan.  Not only was he able to answer all of my questions but was able to teach my husband and me things we had never even considered.  He was honest and forthright with us in all aspects of our needs, never selling us in the least.  He was most concerned about our happiness and not about his company getting the job.  He also pays his installers more than most companies and pays them in a way that they are rewarded for getting the install job perfect, not fast. Yet even with that they move along very quickly.   It was our great pleasure meeting Brian.  We are so happy we found him.  If I ever have to have another wood floor installed I would not hesitate for a second. Brian is the man to work with when it comes to wood flooring.

This place is awesome! Great food great ambiance and desserts to die for!!! The manager Christopher was so nice and personable. He took the time out to talk to us and was very informative. We loooove the orange rolls... Honestly anything in their desert case is awesome. This place is definitely a new favorite!

Beautiful resort.... But unfortunately run by incompetent front desk staff.  They (Jenny) seem to forget that they are the face of this place and made my check in a nightmare. Even the bell guy said they were very rude. News flash if your own staff complains about you something is wrong. Be happy and go out of your way to give a pleasant introduction or maybe you should find a different line of work, that doesn't require any interaction with people!

As a very long time loyal customer of Southwest I was saddened and extremely disappointed today due to horrible treatment. When I read that Southwest had won the 2014 Freddie for Best Customer Service because "we pride ourselves with positively outrageous customer service for our Members" I didn't think they meant outrageously bad customer service.  Their website goes on to read "We're dedicated to doing the right thing to continue earning your trust and loyalty."  I only wish that was true.  There are many options for my extended family and friends to choose from unfortunately that choice has been reduced by one today as we will no longer be patronizing Southwest!

We came here twice and the first night was decent but the second night was awful.  Our food seemed like it was microwaved. The service was good, and that's why the got 2 stars instead if one. I suggest you try somewhere else if you have money you'd like to burn.

There isn't a high enough rating available for me to give this practice for what they deserve.    I recently had to have work done on a broken tooth. Fortunately for me I found Dr. Condie and her extremely professional and friendly team.  I broke a molar on an M & M chocolate peanut of all things. Aleisha, at the front office, was happy to fit me in to doctor Condie's schedule within a week.    For whatever reason I'm extremely uneasy at dental appointments.  But I had nothing to worry about.  From the moment I walked into her beautiful office until my treatment was successfully completed, I was made to feel like a very welcomed guest.  All of Dr. Condie's team are super friendly and yet extremely skilled and proficient.    Rebecca was not only able to put me at ease but was very gentle as she worked on me.   Dr. Condie was also incredibly caring and so skilled in completing my procedure.  The results were spectacular.  I can not recommend a dentist any more.  I've never been so pleased seeing the dentist in my life. Whether it's for a simple teeth cleaning and exam or a crown to fix a broken tooth, I would use Dr. Condie and her expert team every single time.  ~Leeda & Jack

Dr. Swenson has been my doctor for approximately 4 years.  He has been amazing!  Not only is he a phenomenal doctor but he's also a very caring and gentle man.  I travel more than 50 miles one way to see Dr. Swenson but feel that it is well worth that inconvenience to be treated by such a kind and competent doctor.  I am in the health care industry (work at a surgery center) and know how important good patient care is and how difficult it can be to find.  I absolutely enjoy the amount of personal care I receive from Dr. Swenson, never being rushed and always receiving answers to all of my many questions.   The great thing is not only is Dr. Swenson such a wonderful doctor but his staff is great.  I'd recommend Dr. Swanson to anyone who is serious about their health and the relationship they have with their health care provider.

By far the worse experience ever!!!  The manager here is very dishonest and goes out of his way to not help you!!  We purchased 4 suits and paid for tailoring on all four.   After the 1st pair of pants they tailored, we decided to wait to do the others due to the fact that she was absolutely awful at it.   I went back today and the manager Bill, not only had a very bad attitude, but said he couldn't find it in the system.  I'd go anywhere but here for suits!!!

I took my family here while they were visiting after having them over for dinner! They absolutely loved it. They thought I was insane when they saw the line but it moves fast and Is definitely worth the wait! You can try as many as you'd like and everyone is super nice!

If I could give this store 0 stars I would!!! They replaced my daughters phone that was under warranty and then came back and said we need to charge you there was water damage! They never said anything while we were there, I believe it's their way of making money off of people!!!! I will be changing all three phone lines to another carrier not to mention, telling everyone i know to not use them!!!

Came here on a Sunday night for dinner, by far one of the worst experiences ever!! We wanted to purchase the 24 hour pass that I was told was 54.99 and you can use it at 5 different buffets.  Well when you finally get ready to pay....mind you this is after a two hour wait and we are starving, the lady tells us that if we purchase it at any of the other 4 locations it is 54.99 but at this Buffett it is 30 more per person. I swear she was full of it. She did not honor the price listed online. Then she proceeded to ask me if I wanted a manager.  As for the service, our waiter brought us our drinks then never came back to take any plates away.  The food is nothing to rave about. They have pasta that is so over the top spicy it's inedible.... The paella had grains of sand in it I could feel as I was biting into it...  Spend your money anywhere else... Trust me you'll be grateful you did!

I'm not one to post a review usually but when a business far and away exceeds my expectations I gladly give them a review.  The move we just experienced with the help of Dose Moving compels such a review.  The three man team assigned to us couldn't have been better in any way.   Not only were Ian, Seth and Markeith super positive and friendly but we're so thorough in the way they wrapped all of our furniture as well as being so careful.  They unassembled and reassembled all and anything necessary such as beds, legs on furniture, piano etc.  Markeith, the bed-smith, went out of his way to tighten and even fix furniture that had become lose over the years.  Ian and Seth worked hand in hand in a very methodical precise way one would expect from a military operation.  So it was no surprise to discover both men have served our nation with honor and distinction, Ian a navy veteran and Seth an army soldier who had served in Afghanistan, Iraq and other countries around the world.   The respect they treated our homes and furniture was truly remarkable.  My wife and I were absolutely amazed with all three of these young men.  We recommend Dose Moving 100%.  Moving is such a traumatic experience for most of us but having Dose Moving and these three incredible men made the ordeal almost fun.  Thank you Ian, Markeith and Seth we really appreciated your help!!!!

They weren't kidding when they said super small servings.... I placed an order to go and after waiting 20 min she brought me the wrong order. Then she proceeded to say the chef messed up. I ordered the pesto chicken and they made me the protein burger.  She also asked if I'd like to add a side... So I did for $5.50 ( the chili) well when I opened the container, it was full 1/3 of the way.   Seriously?!?!! I pay almost $6 and over 50% of the product is missing. Worst $17 I've ever spent for lunch. If you go here, plan on another stop somewhere else for the rest of your lunch.

Came here for an early dinner with my husband. They have amazing bread! The side salad was a little skimpy.... The portions on the food was huge! We had Alex as our waiter and he was perfect!!! He asked the right amount of questions and was very professional and prompt. Will definitely come back and ask him for our server
