Just went there for the first time last week and had a great experience!  I was able to stock up on a ton of infant girl clothing for my expected bundle of joy.  You can't beat the prices, $1-$5 for pretty much every item I got, and the clothes were all in excellent used condition.  The young girls at the register were also very nice and helpful.  I will be back!!

Just ordered tonight.  I got the honey walnut shrimp and my husband ordered sweet & sour chicken.  The shrimp was smothered in what seemed to be mayo and cream cheese, it was really disgusting looking so I couldn't eat it until I wiped all of that off.  Not impressed with the dish at all, could only eat a few bites.  It was truly the worst meal I have ever ordered at a restaurant...in my life.  No joke.  The sweet & sour was edible but again, not impressed!  I have never seen chicken served like this at a Chinese restaurant; it looked and tasted like a frozen breaded chicken strip with sour sauce on the side.    Needless to say, we will not be eating here again.    For $30 plus a deliver tip this was highly disappointing.  I do NOT recommend.  I'm trying to figure out how they stay in business...surely they receive zero repeat customers?!
