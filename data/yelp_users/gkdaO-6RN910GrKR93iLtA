Absolutely the WORST customer service and LEAST professional business I've ever dealt with. Run the other way and spend your money elsewhere!!!!!!!!!  They installed a pool light at my home and it shattered less than 10 months later. When I called them to see if it was still under warranty, they advised that it was under warranty by the product manufacturer and gave me the name and number of the manufacturer to contact them. Very helpful.  I called the manufacturer and they agreed to replace the light. When the company they had contracted to install it for me came out, they said that it wasn't even the correct brand of pool light. So, I had spent weeks working with the wrong manufacturer because of information provide by AARON POOLS - THE COMPANY THAT INSTALLED IT TO BEGIN WITH. I had to pay a service trip fee to the company that came out, which was money out of my pocket due to the incorrect information provided by AARON POOLS.  I contacted Aaron Pools to let them know about the error. The two people I spoke with - one person who worked in the office and another a manager - both got immediately defensive and started questioning my story, as if they didn't believe me. The manager, Mike, told me that there is no way they would even know what brand of light they installed??? How is that even possible? Do they not keep records? Even so, if that WAS the case, someone from their office confidently advised me on what brand of light it was and how to contact that manufacturer. And she never ONCE said that she wasn't sure if it was the correct information.   At the VERY least, I deserved an apology for getting incorrect information from an employee of the company. I have NEVER felt so disrespected or unappreciated as a customer. I have no idea how this company stays in business.

This is my favorite sushi in the valley, especially when someone else is paying because it's pretty pricy. The sushi always tastes incredibly fresh and the menu has several creative options. I'm not usually a big fan of yellowtail but a friend insisted I try their yellowtail sashimi appetizer. The fiand was so fresh and delicate and the ponzu sauce was so fantastic that I had to restrain myself from licking the plate. I tried big eye tuna sashimi for the first time here and was blown away. I've since tried it at other places and it didn't come close to the flavor and texture of the dish at sushi roku. We had some standard rolls which were also great but my absolute favorite thing I had was the lobster Roll with soy paper and a misoyaki butter sauce. It was so unbelievably delicious! I've been back several times for that roll alone. The ambience is very cool and is great for a special occasion or business dinner.

Crackers is our favorite local spot for breakfast.  There is usually a wait on the weekends but well worth it and they tend to over quote the wait time and seat you sooner. To start, they have delicious coffee which is always a nice way to start the morning. My favorite dish is the California benedict with avocado, spinach and bacon. The ingredients are fresh and theprtion sizes are hearty. I've also tried other dishes such as the cinnamon roll French toast and crepes which were also yummy. I haven't tried their lunch yet but am excited to!

This place is super cute.  It's an old gas station remodeled into a retro, casual restaurant.  They have a fantastic happy hour menu which includes drink specials and a menu of $5 appetizers.  We all tried one of their specialty adult lemonade drinks.  They were delicious and refreshing. Whatever you do, make sure you order the happy tacos. Both the fish & short rib tacos were AMAZING.  I'm looking forward to going back for dinner sometime.

Delicious treats at an amazing price. This is not a combination that is found often. I had heard so many people rave about these donuts and when I finally tried them I confirmed they were not lying. My favorite is the apple fritter. The standard glazed comes in a close second. They are open until 10pm and their drive thru is open 24 hours. Great for a late night sweet craving. Yum!!!
