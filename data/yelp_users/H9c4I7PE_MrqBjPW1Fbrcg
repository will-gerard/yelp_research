I tried contacting them twice through their website's "Contact Us" form with a couple questions, and never got a response. Also, their website does not provide business hours (pet peeve).

We made an appointment with one of their events people, Danny, to check out this place as a potential wedding venue. Saturday morning 9 a.m. We showed up, he wasn't there. We waited 20 minutes. He never showed, never called. We waited a couple weeks, never heard from him or from anyone Doubletree. So ... that's pretty rude and disorganized. Blah.

We chose the Sleep Inn for our wedding hotel. They were extremely friendly and communicative with everything we needed: discounted rooms for our guests, shuttle service, welcome bags, etc.  Great location and very affordable prices for all our guests. Thank you for being so helpful and easy to work with! Especially Danielle!  They even went above and beyond and got us aspirin from a sister hotel at 6 a.m.

They have always been friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. The entire staff really loves animals. They have great hours (open weekends) and are very accommodating. I also thank them for being up front/honest/clear about billing -- overall just very good communication.  In addition to the vets being great, we also like their boarding facility. It's similarly well-organized and well-run, and they have good dropoff and pickup hours, too.  We've had our dog and cats treated here over the past 2 years, and it's always been a nice experience!

Great company! We have used them twice in 2 years, and both times they have been very friendly, punctual, and honest. Communicating with them is very easy via e-mail, and they seem to be able to get you a house appointment within a few days. They were also great about calling ahead of time on the day of the appointment, with a friendly reminder.  Really appreciate their honesty: 2 years ago they opted not to clean our chimney because they said it didn't need it, and today they reduced the price on the dryer vent cleaning because it just needed some minor things done. So they don't overcharge, they are prompt, and they do good work. Will absolutely call them again in the future. Thanks!

They catered our wedding. Their prices were competitive, and the food on the day of the wedding was quite excellent -- even better than we were hoping for. The service and communication was also great. Thank you Jillian!  Overall, highly recommend Heidi's. They're professional, helpful, and executed everything flawlessly at our wedding. They also offer free tasting events in the weeks/months leading up to your event. Thank you!

Very fun, very delicious. We ordered 120 bundt cakes for our wedding. They were excellent -- everyone loved 'em!  NBC was very helpful, friendly, and easy to work with. They delivered the 10 dozen cakes on the day of our wedding directly to the venue. Thank you!

SO great! We had SnapBooth at our wedding, and It was the hit of the night.  They brought tons of hilarious and creative props, practically all of our friends and family tried the photo booth and loved it, and EACH person who went into the photo booth received INSTANT printouts (very cool). We also got a fantastic scrapbook at the end of the night with all of the photos and personalized notes.  Mike was awesome at communicating with us in the weeks leading up to the wedding. He was very pleasant, enthusiastic, and informative, answering all our questions. HIGHLY recommend having this at your event or wedding. People LOVE it!

We hired the food truck for a backyard party we were hosting. Katherine, Ariel, and Megan manned the truck for 2.5 hours and were GREAT! They were so friendly, pleasant, and helpful. The hot dog truck was the hit of the party - the food was just delicious!  Short Leash was on time, supplied all the necessities (dogs, chips, other snacks, napkins, plasticware, etc.), squeezed into a tight spot in our backyard, and made sure everyone was happy. It was a great time. Thank you!

They installed 2 new garage door motors and the corresponding switch buttons. We've had the new openers for about 6 months now, and they have been great. Fast service, very straightforward with the work they did and the products they offered. High quality work - would absolutely recommend to neighbors, friends, family. Thank you!

We decided to have SubZero at a backyard party we were hosting for about 90 people. SubZero was awesome! Such a fun idea, and a very nice group of people.  They showed up on time, served a ton of delicious and creative ice cream (so many cool options!), and brought smiles to a lot of our friends. It's so neat to watch them make the ice cream. Highly recommend hiring them. They were also excellent e-mail communicators in the weeks leading up to the party. Thank you!

We reserved a specialty keg for our wedding reception 2 weeks ahead of time. I showed up to the store the day of the wedding, and the keg we ordered was nowhere to be found. The staff offered no explanation. Infuriating and absolutely unacceptable.

Great service! Bought a 2" Yakima bike rack from these guys last week, and they were excellent! Very knowledgable, helpful, and communicative while the rack was being special ordered for my car. They even put it together and gave me a quick tutorial on how to use it, load it, and dismantle it. A+! Thank you for great customer service. I'll be back.

Recently attended a food/beer pairing event - one of the very best dinner experiences I have EVER had. The brewmaster and head chef visited us before all 8 of the courses, explaining what they had made and why they were pairing them together. It was so personal and thoughtful, and unique and entertaining. Absolutely wonderful event, and we can't wait to go back to NMBC for more beer and food during regular hours!

Nice hidden gem in Scottsdale. Food was amazing (burrata app & flat iron steak were standouts), and service was impeccable. Small place with about 12 tables. Absolutely loved it and will be back!

David was awesome! Very friendly, knowledgeable, and insightful. He carefully inspected our home, inside and outside, to come up with the best plan for our satellite TV needs. He arrived on time, completed the work quickly, and offered suggestions for the future without being pushy at all. Fast communication (text) and very professional work. Will definitely contact him again for future projects. Thanks David!

Food = very good. Service = very nice. Definitely will be back.  My suggestion/complaint is that the website and the Yelp profile says "Delivery: Yes." No, that's not correct. They only deliver for orders of $100 or more.
