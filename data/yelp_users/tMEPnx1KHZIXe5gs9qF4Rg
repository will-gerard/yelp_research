so its official~as much as im a beer snob....im a sushi one too....my last nite in phoenix after a 49er victory was craving the sushi goods...my cousin/his lady said this sakana brand was a chain in az...kudos to him for the plug...this place didnt disappoint...urban legend says this place has a line/long wait....mainly due to the size of the joint...luckily no wait....walkin into this place...your treated like royalty...the sushi chefs & the waiters greet u once u enter & when u leave....so about the food...had to have the tuna shashimi/spicy tuna roll...the icing on the cake was this sushi dish that was called a salmon dynamite/salmon cake on top of this roll...this place was good...jus havin flashbacks now

over 600 reviews & counting....a new one was jus built in sf n never have time to go....why not not fly down to vegas n try it lol....this burger bar should be the standard for all burger bar locations...i walked in the joint & in every seating area had lil tv monitors playin espn....tooo bad we were the unlucky ones to sit in the middle of the chaos & foot traffic...as my reviews on certain foods here on yelp get more & more descriptive i start to ask myself am i becoming a food snob~i never would have thought that i would become a burger snob or even pay $17 for a kobe burger.....but i did here hahahha....kobe beef/medium rare~that juicy burger jus melted in my mouth...it was my first time ever tasting that type of beef...lil shroom/cheddar action to accomodate the taste...& the menu has alot of choices if u really wanna get in depth wit yo burger....so many types of bacon~cheese~toppings...its sucha burger lovers wet dream...ill for sure visit the sf location...

was in vegas for a wedding & did the fancy/smancy thing cuz i love to eat...big fan of the food network & this guys antics on tv...but this place was horrid & over priced~it fits the picture of u receiving a small piece of the main course & paying like $50/plate wit no sides~calamari was watered down...trus me im all about payin the big bucs if its quality....this one wasnt....this was the only party pooper of the sin city trip

so this was my first stop over here after i got off the plane for my 49er weekend....it was rite next to dave/busters....shouldve went to dave/busters first & never step into this establishment =x....i knew not to even look @ the menu when the free salsa tasted nasty...i think this place is for peeps that dunno what tru authentic mexican food is...it gets one star since there are flat screens showin college football...our bartender was classic...we asked for hefenweizen....he said "we dont have that beer here"...then we asked can we have a blue moon...he said "sure~we have that"....that made my day
