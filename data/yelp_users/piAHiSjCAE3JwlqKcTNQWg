I love this place! Great unique gifts, good prices and it seems like they're open nearly round the clock! Nice added touches too, like live music and artists in store demonstrations..

What an amazing end to a really stressful day. We were there for Happy Hour (after being turned away from Upper Crust Pizza on 24th street for having our 19 year old son with us)  We were lucky enough to have Eddy as our server and he was attentive, polite and funny! We sat on the patio, which I believe to be one of the loveliest in the valley and thoroughly enjoyed every moment of our meal. We had the Frito Misto and Cauliflower Gratinata for appetizers and we each ordered our own small pizzas. I had the Calabrian pizza which was amazing, just the right amount of spice, my friend had the Fungi which I believe to be the best mushroom pizza in town, she loved it! We also had the Summer corn pizza and the Salciccia, two of the best pizzas on the menu. We all agreed that this was some of the very best pizza in town.The Parlor certainly knows how to do it right, we will be telling all our friends to go there and will definitely be back!

I am really saddened to have to write this review. I have been a customer since they opened in my neighborhood, for a few reasons. I really like the fact that they are super close, have good pizza,friendly service and great specials. Every time I have been in, whether for eat in or take out, I notice there are never more than 2 other tables of customers. We keep wondering if this place will make it, and we feel good giving them our business and perhaps making a difference in their sticking around.  This afternoon I took a friend in for the first time. It was 4:30 and we were literally the only ones in the entire place, so we had our choice of tables. We chose the bar side inadvertently, I guess, though it wasn't near the bar. We let our server know we were going to be joined by 2 more people. We ordered drinks and appetizers (from the happy hour menu) while we waited for our friends.When they arrived, my boyfriend and his 19 year old son, we were told that we could no longer sit in that section of the restaurant because the son was underage. So, we could move, but not to the patio either because apparently that was considered the "bar" section. (Though it was further away from the actual bar than the "dining" area they wanted us to move to) We could however, move to the dining area on the other side of a small 1/2 wall which was reserved for dining, underage and NON Happy hour dining! Our server informed us that she understood why we were upset and told us it was not her rule but the owner's and she had to enforce it. I wondered why , when we told her we had 2 more people joining us, she didn't let us know of their wacky age policy in what is clearly a restaurant, and not clearly a bar. So, we had 2 choices, move and pay the regular prices rather than the happy hour prices (which was why we had come there in the first place) or send our underage person home hungry. Well, we did what I'm pretty sure anyone else would do, we left and will will never return. Perhaps this explains the empty seats in their restaurant. I have been to many restaurants with bars where children could be served food, this is ridiculous! The server told us the law permits that but it is up to owner's discretion if they want minors in their bar/restaurants. We headed straightaway to the Parlor Pizzeria on Camelback and 19th street where we could be served at any table in the house with our 19 year old family member and still get happy hour! Yay for smart people running good businesses!
