The pizza we had was very greasy. server was nice but I'm rating it on the food and I just can't do more than 2 stars because it was too greasy.

I was so impressed when I went here. The guys that run the place are super friendly and do a great job. They have local beer on tap for growlers and a great selection of beer and wine. The selection of groceries seems a little better than the other local corner stores as well. If you live anywhere near here you should take a look. It's not what I expected.

They carry some good mountain and BMX bikes. I don't ride road bikes so I can't tell you much about the selection of those. Last time I was in the mechanics seemed a little young but overall I have had good experiences here.

I could not be more impressed with this shop. They are primarily dedicated to R/C stuff so don't expect to find your crochet needles and hemp necklaces here. I called looking for a battery for my DJI Phantom drone and they were so helpful and professional I have stopped ordering online parts and I now buy exclusively from them. They do great work (they were even building some professional drones for a movie studio when I was in there).

I was blown away by these guys. Tony was great in helping me decide exactly what would fit my needs and price range. I ordered flowers for a friend whose mother had passed away. She had worked at a florist when she was younger and she could not believe how beautiful the flowers were and how long they lasted. I then ordered flowers for offices who had sent me referrals and got an amazing response. The flowers were always gorgeous, long lasting and prepared on time. I will never use another florist.

The experience started off very well with Jeff, who was helpful and friendly. I was getting quotes for 31" Goodyear MTR's from different shops, he quoted me $972 (within $20 of one of your local competitors) and said he could have them by the end of the week. Since he was helpful and friendly I told him to go ahead and place the order. I also told him I would leave him some good feedback online.   A few days later the tires came in. I told them I would come in at 7 (Google says they are open from 7-7) but I was told they open at 8. Minor detail but it could easily be fixed. I left the truck with (I believe it was) Gary Summitt and told him I was here for the MTR's that had been ordered for me, that I would leave the truck all day and come in after work.  I arrived at 10 till 6 (thinking they closed at 7 per google), and met Ken (I think his last name was Lewis), who was very nice but handed me a bill for 1150, nearly $200 more than the amount quoted by Jeff. I asked if they had replaced the spare and he told me no. When I protested, Ken asked me if Gary had called to tell me an amount or if he had asked me to sign anything. He had not. Ken then asked me if I was OK with paying the higher amount, and I told him no, I wanted the price I was quoted. The next hour was spent with him calling Gary multiple times and trying to modify the price in the computer, periodically asking me if I was OK paying a different amount. I persistently told him I wanted the price I was quoted for the work that was done. Ken was nice enough but he told me he was worried about getting in trouble from Gary. On one of the calls Gary told Ken he wanted me to come back tomorrow morning to talk to him in person about it (my wife had dropped me off at the store 45 minutes earlier) but I told him no, if they couldn't do it for the price they could put my old tires on and I would take my truck and go elsewhere. When (after an hour of fighting) I finally got the price down close to the amount Jeff had quoted me, I signed the paperwork and then Ken tried to get me to sign an additional higher estimate as well. I refused, and told him that I didn't want them to charge me the additional amount and I was never quoted that price.  This experience has left such a bad taste in my mouth that despite how helpful Jeff was in the beginning I will never visit another Goodyear Auto Center, and most likely will never even buy Goodyear tires again from a non-goodyear store. It was one of the WORST experiences I have ever had with a store.

They do great work and pricing is very reasonable.  I had an issue once (there was a cutout on a specific trim level) and they fixed it immediately (within 5 minutes while I waited). Great customer service and a good product at a very good price.  What more could you want?

The sandwiches are tasty but at almost 8 bucks per sandwich it's one of the pricier sandwich shops around.

I generally come in at lunch time, their lunch special is still a HUGE meal and it comes with a drink. The food is always super fresh and the kitchen is open so you can watch them cook in the giant Wok's. Great place, the dining room is very small as it's in a strip mall so it's great for take out or if you come when it's not too busy.

The lunch special is an incredible value. I may never eat fast food again. Dinner is more expensive but is enough food to feed 2 hungry people. Great value, very fresh. The best Chinese food I've had in the east valley. Best for carryout or groups of. 4or less.

Brian and his team have been great. They answered all my questions and really seem to care. Insurance is complicated but they help explain things in ways I can understand. They do all kinds of insurance here as well as some financial services.

Great food and great service here. I always come at lunch time so I'm not sure what it's like in the evening. The sizzling salmon is my favorite. I've tried about 10 things here and they were all very good.

My car was muddy and I just wanted to knock some of the mud off. The gatekeeper told me that he can't let me do the $3 wash with that much mud. He didn't say it won't get very clean (I would have been fine with that). He said he couldn't do it to try to sell me the next step up (2.25X the price). It's a gimmick. I told him that's ridiculous and went to Clean Freak on 44th st and Mcdowell. I will never go to this place again.

The bad reviews must be old,  this place is fantastic! The food is always excellent and the service is friendly and attentive. Seems like they get a late rush, Monday we were in at 7 and the place was empty but by 8:30 there were at least 10 tables full. If you like Indian food or have never tried it you should check it out.

The food was great. Obviously if you don't like Shawarma or you don't like trying new things you shouldn't go here. For the rest of us, the quality is great and the staff was helpful.

They were quick and efficient. It's sometimes hard to trust your home to strangers, especially when something is wrong. These guys did a great job and I would use them again if I needed their services.

Kristin is a miracle worker.  I have been coming here for 3 weeks now. I have been suffering with back and joint pain for over 20 years.  My body feels better than it has in ages.  My stress levels are lower and I walk away feeling more relaxed than I ever thought possible.  Plus Kristin is medically trained and certified so I can pay with my HSA. Her rates are reasonable and her skills are amazing! I have knots in my back I thought she'd need a chisel to break up and she is able to reach the deepest ones. I have seen 5 or 6 massage therapists over the years and Kristin is my favorite by far.

Food and service were great. Lots of TV'S, 2 patio's (1 smoking and 1 non smoking). Full bar, seems consistent. A little hidden but it's behind the McDonald's so you don't get much noise from the road when you're on the patio.

Wow. I was so blown away by the flavor in the brisket. incredible. I never knew meat could be so euphoric. I kept hearing this place was amazing and I am sooooo glad I stopped here. The only problem now is I won't ever be able to pass it without stopping!

These guys are awesome. They seem like they know their insurance and have a good variety of products. They are helpful and have been happy to answer all my questions. The location is a little hard to see from the street so if you go there in person keep your eyes open.

These guys are the best. They know their stuff and they take great care of their customers. I went to at least 15 bike shops before I found Rage. I haven't been back to any of the others since.

I have been in 3 times now for parts and I was very impressed how helpful Aaron was. I haven't used their service department but I will. This is for sure one of the most professional and well stocked shops I have been to. I highly reccomend them.
