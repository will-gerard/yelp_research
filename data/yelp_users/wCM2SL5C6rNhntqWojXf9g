I normally order the Gambos Con Ajo and kids normally get the traditional hummus.  I have been going to this location for the past 3 years and is a huge fan.  From location to location the taste is slightly off but tonight, it was way off at one of the best tasting locations that I LOVE to dine at (Chandler).  My Gambos dish was very sour, it tasted like they forgot the garlic and put a dash too much tomato paste.  As a matter of fact that was all that I had tasted.  My children's hummus tasted like mashed fava beans with a dash of tahini...no flavor at all.    I had asked my waitress if the ingredients has changed and she advised me that they have a new distributor and cut back the oil portion used to mix the hummus.  If these changes are permanent, it appears my frequency in dining here will change.  Pita Jungle, PLEASE go back to how you cooked things from the beginning!

The Crepe Bar in Tempe finally has a stiff competitor.  I absolutely am in love with this place, price and the right variety in menu.  Their menu price is anywhere between $3-$7.  Very affordable!  The facility is very small, and you may have to wait a few minutes prior to being seated.  The service is a little slow and takes a bit to warm up to the staff because initially because they did not come off too friendly.  My 3 kids and I ordered 3 dessert crepes. We ordered Nutella w/whip, banana Nutella and a savory cheese, egg and avocado crepe! Delish!!   My son does not like crepes because he is very particular with what he eats however this crepe hit the right spot because he guzzled it down like water.  The portion size is enough to fill you up! The crepes were soft, fresh and just right! The fillings were made with fresh vegetables and fruits without the gooey preserves that normally comes with any fruit crepe.  We would definitely come back! We spent a whopping $17 for 4 orders of crepes and an iced vanilla latte!

I don't really want to give them a star but a star is deserved for the nurse who provides children with immunization because my kids loved her.  I had a very long discussion with them over their billing practices and long story short if you seek this office for care, please check your explanation of benefits as they will double dip at every opportunity based on what their billing manager had explained to me. If you had scheduled for a well visit, and your child has a scratch, they will charge you 2 visits (1 well exam and 1 sick visit). Makes no sense but apparently it is clear in their minds and they say they legally could. Is it ethical? I think not!

What can I say? This place hits the hangry button inside my stomach somewhere every single time!  The venue is a bit small and lines are always out the door. I do not mind waiting for those delicious Wildberry pancakes smothered with marscarpone cheese. The wait is usually not too bad...average 25 minutes every time. The staff are super duper friendly and very accommodating.    The service is incredible! The minute that you place your order, you will receive your food within 10-15 minutes! The ingredients are all fresh and clean!!! What do I mean by clean? No gooey substitutes for fruits, always fresh fruits and veg! What can I say? I absolutely love this place....I have been here 3 Saturday's in a row and the food is always consistent when it comes to taste!! Highly recommend!

I had the Summertime Omelet and coffee. My dish was $12.00; a bit pricey for the omelet however it was very fresh and passed the palette test. There were bits of avocado, crumbled feta cheese and fresh crunchy peaches seared on the side with a slice of brioche toast.  The serving size is decent. I will definitely come back.

I ordered Chilaquiles.  $8.50 - the menu is very vague, I would recommend asking what their version of a specific dish is because I was fairly disappointed with mine.  I received a platter of chips, cheese , salsa n an egg prepared over easy.  Looked like a platter of nachos.  They had missed one ingredient...chicken.  They apologized and asked if they could just give me a side of chicken. Then they gave me 20% off of my bill...not sure how I feel about that.  Anyway...just ask questions before you order!

I am a regular here and had absolutely loved this place! My kids also love dining here when we are trying to grab a quick bite!  We always ordered the same thing every single time! Thai steak salad lightly dressed, banana Nutella pinwheels and turkey cucumber pinwheels.  I discovered that they had changed their menu this morning!!! I was complaining to my husband the other day that he got me the wrong salad because the ingredients did not jive! Now I owe him an apology because they totally took away the Thai Asian Salad and replaced it with an Asian salad! The current Asian salad has pieces of pineapples and the dressing just did not go together. I am so sad to have discovered that they put the previous Asian salad in it's grave....I guess this will not be my go to anymore uhhhh....so sad!  I hate when restaurants do this...they have something that a lot of people like and decide to pull it away for whatever reasons.
