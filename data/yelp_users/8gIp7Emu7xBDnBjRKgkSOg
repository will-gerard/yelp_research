Love Unbacio for happy hour! Great location as well!  We've always sat in the bar at a comfortable high top table. I've only stuck to the Seafood Salad, it is very light and fresh. The bar has a fun atmosphere with quite a bit of regulars and people watching!

Literally two minutes from my old home and we were desperate. The place was totally empty at like 8pm on a friday night. My friend ordered the appetizer sampler and I order the spinach salad with no dressing add grilled shrimp! The waitress asked if we'd like to eat "together", weird way to phrase it, and I asked to have both dishes served at the same time.  Well, within 15 minutes the sampler was dropped off, no salad nor waitress in sight.  After about 10 minutes she tops by and I ask about my salad. She sneaks back to the kitchen and three minutes later informs me that it should only be about 10 minutes. She asks my friend if she'd like to have the kitchen "hang on" to the sampler and serve the dishes together in a couple minutes!  It was so absurd, especially since the appetizers were supposed to be served hot and the odd dip had already congealed.  A manager finally delivered  a salad, but definitely not the one I had ordered.  When I noted the error she asked what I wanted her to do, and I asked for the check and sent the salad back. Eventhough no food had actually been consumed she neglected to comp or amend the check! What horrible customer service!!

Once was great..... lost it's touch with changing of kitchen staff. We would always score a prime booth and have the best  spot to watch the ridiculousness that would ensue. Cougars, bikers, confused tourists, and a sprinkling of elderly folk! It was a riot, while the food was good!  Great salads, the best blue cheese dressing in the valley. The old kitchen manager, the owner's daughter even taught us her trick! I've had the Caesar, spicy Thai, both with grilled chicken or shrimp. Friends would have either salmon sliders or quesadillas.   Some places just loose their magic.........

I have a soft spot in my heart for YC's. I used to go there all the time on my way home from ASU. I, like many others, have my special concoction. All veggies no sauce, mostly broccoli, shrooms, water chestnuts, and baby corn. The best trick i use is to line your bowl with the crunchy wontons before they ladle your cooked food in to it! It tastes so good, but I am one to like soggy cereal!  Also, they'll cook without oil if you prefer, which I always ask!

We went here early on a weekday afternoon. We were seated in a comfy booth behind a quintet of cougars. They provided all the entertainment we needed, and it was quite sad when they were cut off at 5:15pm on a Tuesday afternoon. Once they were given the no-go to more booze all hell broke loose. They were literally escorted out kicking and screaming by 4 manager/security guys. I feel bad for the kids they were probably picking up at soccer practice later that night!   We had crab cakes, Miso Sea Bass, and a shrimp salad. The miso sea bass rivaled the one served at Nobu. It was so fabulous, something we weren't expecting. The salad was average and the crab cakes were served with a scrumptious citrus sauce! We were impressed with this chain and will be back!

It is seriously all about the diet lemonade. I have purchased gallons for my house, it is that addicting and delicious!  At first the cashiers would give me strange looks, but now they accept and embrace me!

The first time I went, about 4 years ago, we sat in the dining room . Service was adequate, the food was good enough, and it was just an average experience. As we walked out, we noticed that the bar was the place to be! Since then we have been for happy hour at least 20 times.   We make reservations and a booth is always waiting for us! Live Jazz and the people watching is always a plus. Skip the bread, it's not worth it. I think we've tried pretty much every appetizer on the menu. Hands down favorite are the Shrimp and Shitake fritters. The Kung Pao calamari is unique, the addition of peanuts and crunchy veggies. The sauce is divine and we always order extra for the fritters! The Ahi in soba broth (not the tartare) is light and fresh.  Don't waste the cals or tummy space on the Tempura scallops. The Jumbo shrimp and crab salad is a treat and the portion is huge.  They also have amazing blue cheese dressing, even though it is quite garlicky.  Also a miss were the lobster spring rolls, they were too fried and crunchy with no trace of lobster!  We tend to stick with the happy hour offerings, but we tried a special soft shell crab tempura once. It is one of the best things I have ever had!

It's a chain, but I love it! Practically everything we have ordered here is fantastic! I usually get a southwestern Caesar salad with no chicken sub shrimp! It is the best Caesar salad. The jerk chicken salad is awesome as well, as is the chopped chicken salad.   Sometimes we go for happy hour because their half off specials are amazing. They used to have the most delicious nachos with black beans, but they have since vanished from the menu. Oh how I long for those nachos, haha. The shrimp dumplings are top notch, and the ahi is delectable. Misses are the catfish beignets and the fish tacos, just didn't hit the spot.   We go here all the time- the servers are attentive and always remember our quirks and orders.

I love appetizers, especially Asian appetizers! My favorite thing to do is to split a bunch of appetizers. We do not eat sushi because of the rice, so we were delighted to see that they offered quite an array of other choices! We ordered the giant shrimp spring rolls, duck egg rolls and tempura shrimp. The tempura shrimp was absolutely divine, but everything else lacked. The tempura were huge and a perfect crispy and light crunch! The shrimp egg rolls were quite odd, a giant shrimp stuffed in a spring roll wrapper with a stalk of asparagus and drizzled with an unnecessary mango sauce. We took one bite and stopped! The duck egg rolls tasted prefab and completely not worth the calories! The place was quite busy, probably because of the happy hour specials. They seemed to have great deals on the sushi and assorted typical appetizers (gyoza, edamame, pork egg rolls). We will definitely go back for the shrimp tempura, it was a STEAL at 3.75 for 3 pieces!!
