So I call in and ask if they have tofu. They say yes. I ask if it's cooked. They say yes. I ask for low mein with tofu on top. She said she couldn't do that. I asked for tofu on the side and just plain low mein, she said she couldn't do that. I had to twist her arm by asking the simple question "are your cooks not competent enough to throw some tofu on top of some noodles?" and she said they were, then she goes on to tell me that if we did that then it would cost 4 dollars more. 4 dollars for tofu. Tofu is cheaper than meat. I asked for the tofu extra crispy THEN she goes "oh yeah we can't do that" so I just asked her to have the cooks cook it longer than they normally do and she said they can't do that. If they literally can't do some really really basic simple stuff like that then that's sad. I hung up at that point and went to good china.

These guys know me by name at this point. They're awesome. Best Thai on the East Valley. Like the red curry... omg... or the perfect Pad Thai. Don't be scared to try it with tofu. Extra crispy if you don't like soft tofu. Spice level 3 is my sweet spot. I enjoy 4 every now and again. They deliver quickly too!

Michael was amazing. I have been combing my hair the wrong way the last 4 years and he simply just told me. I assume no other barber really wanted the confrontation possibility but he is a professional and I took his word. My hair is way easier to comb. Even if you don't make an appointment with these guys it's totally worth even an HOUR wait. I drive out from Gilbert to have these guys clip my hair. (it's conveniently on the way to my parents house two birds one stone haha) I don't trust anyone else with my hair. Honestly. I used the same review for yelp as I did for good. Excellent craft from these fellas.

The outside of the building is awesome looking. Might be an old Denny's but they redecorated nicely. The inside is very clean. The servers are nice and courteous. The hot and sour soup is some of the best I've ever had. I ordered the orange chicken extra spicy. It was the perfect amount of spice. Overall the best Chinese I've had in the west valley. Don't mind bad service reviews these guys just opened a week or so ago.
