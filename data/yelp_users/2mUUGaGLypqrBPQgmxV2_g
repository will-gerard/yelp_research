Always packed so get there early or hang around while you wait, esp on weekends.  We like to go with a small group for their HH! Good deals and quick service. Will have to try the teppanyaki next time.

Went it for a haircut and it was so quick and inexpensive. Cash only to keep the prices low. Thank you for the haircut! Will try to get a color treatment next time.

Super tasty lunch spot! Look like the combo lunches (different proteins like beef or chicken) with creamy mac salad and a little orange slice. Will try the spam masubi next time. Simple mom and pop place, support local businesses!!

I moved and needed a new dry cleaners. This review receives one star for the ridiculously high prices. One pair of pants and dress was over $11. They also never took out the spot on the hem of the pants...beyond awful. I'll make it a point to check out Happy Cleaners across the street.

My dog Lexie has been seeing Simone for about a year now. Simone is a very sweet groomer who takes really good care of her. The prices are very reasonable. It always feels good to support a local business.   Lexie doesn't even mind the pretty cat that naps on the front desk. Check out Aardbark if you need a reliable, consistent grooming company.

I have been a customer at Liberty for years! Highlights are the Salmon BLT, cuban, the sea bass special, coffee bar and my all time fave dessert there the Salty Bar. I remember a while back I was craving the salty bar, chocolate, peanut butter pastry with sea salt on top...they just closed up and I pressed my little face begging them to let me buy a salty bar even for $20! The owner opened the door and gave me a corner piece on the house. THIS WAS CHRISTMAS to me. The coffee bar is our favorite place to take out-of-towners as they have very tasty espresso or Vietnamese iced coffees. We love downtown Gilbert but Liberty makes the top of the list.

After the holiday, I went to try breakfast for the 1st time at the Farmhouse. The first impression is that the place is very charming and Pinterest-y. The servers are all female and helpful. We ordered the specials - chorizo and black bean omelette with salsa verde and the veggie scramble. It has asparagus, broccoli and other green goodness. Both meals were served with whole wheat baguette and potatoes. I was not a fan of the potatoes and they were sliced in large discs and were not crispy. I was a fan of my omelette and the portion of it was huge we had to take some home. They were good with refilling our iced tea and coffee and at the end of the meal we split the cinnamon roll. Very homemade and the most delicious cream cheese frosting. That was definitely a hit.  I ordered a meal for my brother to-go, he said the Farmhouse Ham steak and eggs were very tasty as well.   There seemed to be a wait for other folks so we hustled out of there. Tip is to come early like we did, around 8:45 AM, even though this was a random Tuesday. The place is small and the wait might be annoying in the outside heat.  I enjoyed my meal and looking forward to the other Sunday tip when they serve country fried steak, but only on Sundays.

Very cute deli and market, love the gyro special lunch with extra sauce. Cheap, delish and authentic food! We always get a mix of all the different flavors of baklava after as well.   Will have to try the lamb next time!!

Going for restaurant week and we sat on the patio. The service was excellent!  Highlights for me: Duck Panzanella, tasty modern tacquitos, super crispy with cauliflowers, creme brulee was fantastic with thinly sliced peaches as well. Ordered a bottle of red to share with the 4 of us and the server had a cool little fact about the Sean Minor wine.  Friends enjoyed the short rib app, the pork dumpling. For dessert we had amaretto as well.   The only lowlight was the chocolate cake. My guy took a few bites and gave up. The server was very kind as to offer him the creme brulee which was so much better. It was a lovely evening and everyone enjoyed themselves. We love House of Tricks.

I have been going to Tott's since my college days - it used to be on McClintock and Guad.  Faves: walut shrimp, pork rolls, orange peel shrimp. Young owns and manages this place and I have noticed that this somoe of his staff has been with him for years. That says something. The place is always clean and the staff is very friendly. Quick counter service and I always get at least 2 meals from my takeout order. They do the share a meal deal with app, two entrees and dessert for dine in only and that was a tasty good deal as well. I'm a total regular and very proud of it. It's nice to support a great, local business. Check out Tott's!

We went for HH...we have been to both the Gilbert and Sky Harbor locations but wanted to try the OG. Sadly, they are all pretty disappointing.  PROS The Chambord Horchata was very tasty Queso Fundido was very very cheesy and can easily be shared between 2-3 people  CONS Small space Our server could not be bothered to help us - the service was pretty atrocious. Example: ~10 min for someone to greet us, ~30 min for water, sitting in the corner in a super drafty area...  Since we have tried 3 Barrio locations and have not been wowwed at any of the locations, we will not be dining with them ever again.

Checked in late Friday night and was told that we were not able to have Club Access during our stay. Even though it was listed in the rate details in our confirmation and was half the reason why we booked this hotel. The pool was messy and there were people there who were not hotel guests, you can easily tell. Called in the AM to let front desk know about the access issues and was met with attitude on the phone. I called Customer Care after the trip and am waiting a response from the hotel management.

Me and my crew of 4 went here after a Cardinals game.  Pros: -Large space -Nice servers -Huge selection menu, good enough to split between 2-3 people -Sporty, had the games on -Tasty sauces   Cons: -We were stuffed after just a few bites -Very Very far! -Mac and Cheese was underwhelming  I would only try Bobby Q again if were in the area but will not make a point to drive from the East Valley.

I have been here a handful of times. It's in a convenient location where you can get soem shopping done or grab a drink in Old Town after. The restaurant has a good vibe; great modern decor. The wait staff and hosts/hostesses are incredibly attentive. Bonus: they are crazy good looking too. The last time I ate here, I was with 4 other girls. One of my friends broke her sandal and I asked the host if we could have some tape. Bonus points to him for giving us Velcro. We had an Open Table rezzie so we were seated right away in the dining room. I will have to ask to sit outside next time when it cools down...  We ordered much needed wine and cocktails and started off with the bruschetta. It was super tasty, seasoned perfectly and was great to share with the girls. The girls ordered shrimp and grits and salads and other dishes I can't remember off the top of my head but I went with the scallops. Moral of the story: great, fresh food and at a decent price. I didn't have room for dessert but we ordered gelato for the table. The waiter messed up on the number of scoops but that was the only thing that went wrong. Everyone cleaned their plates and was swooning over their meals. I think on the weekends they have a DJ right in the entrance, the music was actually pretty good but not sure if it fits with the crowd. There were very few people/tables who were our age (mid 20's) If you're in OT, check this place out.

Very authentic very fantastic food! Our faves are the tapatio burrito, chimichanga, and al pastor tacos. The same lady helps us each time and she is very attentive and helpful. Eat here and you won't regret it!! We love taking our out of towners here for the authentic experience, great prices too!!  Sometime, they have empanadas on special - cheese ones are very delicious!!

I have been going here since my ASU days. I love that it's a mom and pop place. I love the funky wall art and the sweet owner who makes it a point to ask me how my mom is doing. (Asians know all Asians. Fact.) I love boba. I do, I really do. Banana and chocolate boba, please! There are plenty of tables to just hang out and relax in to stay out of the heat. If I'm meeting someone and they're late (BC I'm always early) there are always good mags to flip through. Go support local businesses and grab some boba from The Street. Total win win.

I had lunch here with my team to send of a co-worker who is leaving. The lunch specials were a little different than what I am used to. I hadn't heard of a few dishes that were listed. There were about 15 of us and it didn't take that long for our orders. I ordered the pork with pineapple, others tried the pad see ew, curries and and pad thai. I could tell that the pineapple was not fresh but it wasn't bad for less than 8 bucks. The iced tea was very tasty and refreshing and I will for sure try the Thai iced tea next time. There wasn't an empty table in the whole place. All lunch specials come with soup and an eggroll, both yummy and seasoned well.  Take it for what is, a quick and easy Thai place to grab lunch.

Tasty boba, good snacks, super cute and friendly service! Took a few girlfriends from work here for their first time and they loved it. Our favorite flavors are lychee, chocolate and banana, and papaya! The space is really relaxed, TV's and music playing. Good crowd and I like going here for a quick drink to go or to sit and chat with friends for a bit. Thanks Boba Tea House!

We are a fan of this place for lunch as it is way less pricier than dinner.  Love the little salad apps that come out before - the apple one is my favorite. Love the BBQ and bibimbop, flavorful and the egg is always cooked just right. The service can be really packed on a Friday lunch so get there early to avoid long food wait times. The good thing is there are quite a few asian folks that dine there so you know it's good!

I have been going to Desert Eye for years. I am going to divulge my age here but I am 25 and have been seeing Dr. Pearson since I was 10 years old. My parents and brother have been going to Desert Eye for years as well. Dr. Pearson is very knowledgeable as well as his staff. I was very pleased with the selection of glasses. During my most recent visit a few months ago, I couldn't decide between 2 pairs. Luckily, Matt was there to convince me that these gorgeous Gucci frames were the best fit for me.  I am surprised to read about the logistical nightmare that W.H. had but I cannot recall this ever happening to me. I actually called the office the next day to compliment the staff on the wonderful customer service. The glasses arrived 2 weeks later and I have received many compliments. Thank you Desert Eye!

Great patio and it doesn't feel like you are in AZ. The self serve drinks and coffee was a little annoying but the food was very tasty. We shared the apricot scone and I had the special, chilaquiles with chorizo, beans, guac and sour cream. My guy had the trout omelette that was served with home fries and a biscuit. They first didn't offer jam so he  had to ask for it, doesn't seem like they are well staffed on a Sunday morning. This was my 1st time here and we went early ~9AM and I suggest you do the same as there was a wait as we left the restaurant. It's a   short walk as there is not right in front but it's cute to see the farm/greenhouse and little open businesses. Will go again as it is cooling down in AZ but I don't really see us coming in the summer, maybe for brunch after a hike at South Mountain.

I have been to Spices about 3 or 4 times. For today's lunch, I took my team here. Only 3 of the 7 girls have been here. The place was packed. I think I witnessed someone on their kitchen staff quit. He threw his hat and apron on the ground the owner went after him. Not sure if he came back or not? This could be why the kitchen/service/experience was so horrendous. We were told the food would take 20-25 minutes. We were able to grab a large table (not a lot of seating) and waited for our food. Every dish that came out, was cold. Our group's entrees (falfel sandwiches, gyro sandwiches, lamb schwarma) staggered and side dishes (chicken kabobs and fries) took forever. There were no clean forks, we had to use plastic silverware. The worst part, the part that make me cringe - my friend's chicken kabobs were raw. I really hope my friend doesn't get sick. This restaurant is always packed for lunch but dead for dinner. One of the girl son my team confirmed that dinner service was never like this. I was really disappointed with today's service. I was waiting to flag a guy to help clear some tables and I overheard the woman next to me communicating to one of the bus boys that her fries were cold. He asked if she wanted him to fry them again...not acceptable. Going back to the raw chicken....the owner wanted to cook another batch for us but I didn't want to bother I was so frazzled. We were about to leave but one of the folks on his staff came by with  $5 gift card. My GF didn't even want the card and just gave it someone else. This was definitely not a good first impression for the girls on the team and will be the last time I ever go to Spices. The consensus was that the wait time, service and experience was not worth our time for mediocre food.

My work lunch crew used to love this place. Used to love this place. This place used to serve my favorite rice soup the avogolemono soup. It was heaven. Since the change in ownership, this restaurant has severely declined.   Last week, the 6 of us sat down for a fun Friday lunch. 20 minutes later we ordered our meals and when they came out we were all disappointed. Sadly, the food was all cold. My friend and I had to return the rice soups. It had a baby food like appearance and tasted even worse. My halloumi and eggplant had no flavor and was cold. The waitress came back and when asked how it was going, I responded with a "Meeh, we have had better, what happened here?" Doing a round robin of what we all thought was going on with our dishes...falafel was dry, greek salads might as well been named onion salads, bland, cold...it was a tasty lunch to say the least.   What a shame. There are few Greek/Med places near Intel...looks like Cyrpus on Queen Creek and Alma will remain our go to place. Let's hope they get their act together soon! I will no longer be a customer at this restaurant.

Great HH before a game! Mac n cheese (tasty and crispy cheeze it topping), dirty fries (cheesy and seasoned well, good spice) and the buffalo wings w/blue cheese are our faves. White sangria for me and cheap local beer for my guy as well. Tried the meatloaf sliders recently and they were disappointing, will stick to our usual.

For the last weekend of summer rates, my honey and I stayed at the Biltmore and purchased the Ocatilla package. It was a separate building that had a separate lounge that offered different amenities during the day. It is also included GC's to Frank and Albert's and Wright's.  Pros: -Easy to check in and out -Allowed for early check in -Self parking -Food @ Wright's (lamb and tartare was delish) -Pool open 24 hours  Cons: -Guest rep at check in was asked to book the reservation for our dinner @ Wright's...didn't do it -The food and drink options were limited and average at the Ocatilla lounge -The chairs against the tile in the lounge sounded horrific -customer service was so below average t the Ocatilla lounge. No skim milk, no real "Full continental breakfast" -Dinner @ Wrights, my guy had a scorpion crawl up his leg and killed it right before dessert. The server and manager made excuses, was sorry but not REALLY sorry. They comped the souffle but was a little uneasy with their response -elevator in Ocatilla building was a hot box - felt like a thousand degrees -Could not accommodate late check out  Based on the list above...I would not have another staycation here.

Will be switching to TMobile today. The representatives at this location are really good at hiding the hidden costs I will see on my bill after. Went do Tmobile for their awesome plan and I will be cutting my total bill in HALF.  Do not make the same mistake I did and overpaying for my Verizon bills with their overall crappy customer service. On all ends, in the locations, on the phone, through chat.  So over it!

Been going to La Vida for years. The membership allows your monthly credit to roll over. Will miss Jessica, the aesthetician who left. The best masseuse is Ann. If her calendar is booked, I wait - it's not worth it for the other therapists.

Ordered teh pineapple fried rice and pad see ew. Both were very delicious. More than enough food for two people - leftovers are great.  'The decorations were very pretty. The only thing I didn't like were the menus that were in binders, a bit tacky.  Will definitely try again!

Brian was very nice and professional. He cleaned all the tile in my house for a reasonable price. The tile looks great, we can definitely see a difference in grout color. There were a few spots that didn't pick up the sealer and he was kind enough to come back the following week and redo them. He was very knowledgable and I would recommend him for any cleaning job. I was very pleased with how attentive and detail oriented he was. Make sure you use Bradley Carpet Cleaning!!

This pains me. We have been to CPH multiple times, they have the best HH in the valley!  However, last week during HH after ordering multiple snacks and cocktails, my date ate the oysters and was violently ill later that evening. I didn't eat any oysters and felt fine. I am concerned with how they handle their seafood.

We gave CPH another try for HH and enjoyed cocktails and bites such as the nuts, bone marrow, hush puppies, chopped salad and the duck burger. All were good but glad to have split the burger as it was very rich and intense. Loved the fries as they cooked very crispy on the outside but pillowy soft inside.   Bone marrow - wasn't a ton of it but liked the mini pancakes underneath. The hush puppies were the best out of the apps. Chopped Salad is always a winner, great crunch and flavors.  It wasn't too busy for a Friday night but our Server wasn't around as much and noticed he was more attentive to the other tables around us. The only difference was that we were around 20 years younger than the other tables. Other than that, enjoyed our meal and drinks @ CPH.

My boyfriend made a terrible mistake tonight. For our last day during restaurant week we chose this restaurant. This was a poor decision on so many levels. It all started this afternoon when I called to confirm the time of the reservation and pushed it out an hour. The person on the other end sounded like he was 12. I am sure he wasn't but perhaps he wasn't the best person to choose to be the first impression of the restaurant as you walked in the door. He mispronounced the name of the restaurant and was unprofessional. Strike 1.   We arrived and noticed that the audience on the patio was older. Very much older. We were greeted by said 12 year old and were not even escorted to our table. My guy said he could tell that this was going to be a very slow experience, We were thirsty and anxious and the 12 year old took our food over before even taking our drink order or filling our water glasses. Strike 2.  What else can I say? That the female cook came out and complained that there was a "rush' with zero people in the dining room and empty tables on the patio service? for the prixe fixe menu - I ordered the escargot, lamb chops and creme brulee. He ordered the shrimp casserole, short ribs and apple tart. While we were waiting for our food we looked around and people were just...not very impressed. The gentleman next to us asked for bread and when the 12 year old told him they don't serve break, the customer retorted with, "How does a French restaurant not serve bread?" Strike 3.  The dishes were fine. They were average. They were underwhelming. It's not even worth describing the dishes, they cons definitely outweigh the pros. This "creme brulee" was not one at all it was more like a souffle. The short ribs were a less flavorful version of your mom's. We are on strike 23 but whose counting?   It might sound harsh but why are there no good French restaurants in AZ? Why is it that I have to travel out of AZ to find a decent French meal? Does anyone remember Citrus Cafe in Chandler? I do, it was spectacular. And I have never missed it as much as I do tonight.   Save your time, money and calories on anything else but La Petite France.

For the Women's Cup Final, 14 of us went to BLD to watch the game and to have a drink. There were 3 parties there. Our big party, 2 women in a booth and a sad lady at the bar. We arrived a little late and it looked like my friends had ordered drinks and snacks and when the US scored, we cheered! How exciting! We loved watching sports @ BLD. Then...the female bartender "shushed" us. She shushed us? For cheering in a bar/restaurant? In a very, very empty bar I might add. This is not a library, my friend.  Game over.  My girlfriends saw that terrible act and gesture as well and said the other bartender was giving them sass so that was the final straw. He said something along the lines of, "You guys need to be more quiet since there are other patrons here." Right, ONE other patron. Give me a freaking break.  We asked for checks and left. The sad lady at the bar seemed to be the female bartender's friend. She looked like a hot mess and was visibly frazzled. Sorry, not my problem. She was still drinking champagne though so it couldn't have been THAT bad. The two girls in the booth left by the time we got our checks. They were most likely not impressed by the staff as well. It was appalling. Did something change? Ownership? Management? BLD just lost a TON of business. Yesterday and the future. It was convenient since we all work at Intel and live within a few miles. BLD you have lost patrons that used to love going to your place to watch a game. But this type of service has unraveled the fact that your menu is mediocre and over priced. We found out later that evening from a friend that BLD has had a number of food code violations. No wonder the place is empty. Link for last year's article:  http://phoenix.about.com/od/healthinspectionsbad/fl/restinspectbad031614.htm  BLD - Below average, Low quality Dining. I'll be going to The Ivy Mediterranean Lounge right next door from now on and so should all of you.

PROS Charming little restaurant with authentic Cambodian decor Spring rolls were made just right and had the right crisp factor  BYOB - we brought our wine and they provided a bottle opener  CONS No host/hostess at the front door so we sat ourselves and waited for over ~10 min and another party walked in as well. Awcko taco. The AC felt like it wasn't on and had to ask for the ceiling fan to be turned she didn't, so we turned it on ourselves. The papaya salad was a little "too authentic" for me. There were little fish heads and the first bite I felt sick, it was OVERLY fishy   The overall experience was just a little underwhelming. The noodles we had were very average they are comparable to the Chinese version of beef chow fun...this was way out of way and we won't be dining here again.

How does this place have such a high rating?  We went on a recommendation and were excited for the healthier versions of wings!  VERY disappointed. The wings were too spicy, the salad was underwhelming, the fake chicken had no flavor. Luckily, we were in downtown PHX so it wasn't too out of the way otherwise, we would have been even more bummed. We are both non-vegetarian but LOVE vegetarian food and will have to keep searching for our go to place.  Save your money and cook better veggie dishes at home.

We went with another couple and their 1 year old baby who was a bit hit with all the other patrons. I ordered the 6 pierogi plate with potato, cheddar and it came with tasty bacon, sour cream and saukerkraut. The star was definitely the saukerkraut. I also ordered a side of the smoked polish sausage with sauerkraut as well.  BF ordered the stuffed cabbage that came with pierogis and the lunch special with 6 pierogis that were all the same flavor. We devoured our plates. The place is adorable, deli style seating in the front and inside but very small, with giant shelves of pickled veggies and dips. Service was a little odd, it was a younger guy who had to do it all, take orders, bus and run out food. It was getting very busy around 1. Next time we are around we will have to stop in and buy the frozen ones.  It was a very chill lunch and happy to report that we will be back soon.

Handlebar is our usual place on Mill. The atmosphere is a little less ASU-y and more chill with a great patio with picnic tables. The bartenders have been there a while so that's a good sign.  Tasty beer and cider and snacks and we sometimes play jenga if we have a group of friends with us. The service is prompt and always fun to interact with the bartenders when there is a game on.

5 of us went to HH. There was no wine menu, the server had to recite the wine list for us. Chardonnay was not chilled very well. The list of cons is as follows:  Weird table set up, only tables and seats for 4, had to grab an extra chair. 2 servers for the entire restaurant. BF ordered the wagyu burger and onion rings - confirmed the burger was cooked to death after asking it to be medium, onion rings were cooked in very old oil. My watermelon salad was sad and underwhelming - there was no flavor and the presentation was lackluster. Service was a little slow in the beginning but towards the end of our meal, he kept trying to take my plates multiple times as I was eating.  This was everyone's first time here and we were not impressed. The reason why I tried it is because it is next to the hot yoga place I used to go to. We won't be coming back as it was such a disappointment!

Our group of 7 tried this place for HH. There are only drink specials which were pretty decent prices.   Everyone love the food so much. We ordered the garlic/butter naan, kati rolls, gobi manchurian, tikka, eggplant curry, okra, so many other tasty dishes. Everyone was sharing the dishes and I loved how the Tikka Masala actually tasted like tomatoes.  The reason why I am giving this place 1 star is that the service was pretty slow, our water glasses were empty...but my guy and I felt really sick after we ate the food. Our tummies were not happy a few hours later and for the rest of the night. What worried me what the most recent reviewer about him and wife getting food poisoning...  I don't think we will be heading back to PTI any time soon for fear of getting sick again.

Got there early for lunch - ordered the popular Gangnam meal for 2 - diff types of protein.  PROS: variety of salads and apps served first, multiple cuts of meat + shishito peppers, crab wontons were delish. favorite salad was the tofu and the pasta salad.   CONS: not enough servers for lunch on a Sunday, certain requests had to be made twice, low on water refills, staff spread way too thin, bibimbap was not good at all, did not have that crispy layer and there was no fried egg. The NY strip was flavorless.

Good atmosphere but the food prices were a little high for what you get. Good deal on wine during happy hour: buy one bottle get another bottle for $1. I was in a large party for a birthday and service was prompt she was kind enough to grab some candles for the birthday girl. We ordered appetizers and my salad which I ordered as an entree was very tasty. I ordered the s'mores for dessert as well. It looked neat at first but the heat was very overwhelming for the table. I would try this place again.

Very fun and lively place for a late dinner with loud music and great people watching. Tons of large groups with bachelorette parties. We had a late night dinner @ 10 PM and ordered a pitcher of red sangria, stuffed dates, skewers, firefly fries and other tapas. The place was very busy on a Friday night so different people helped with our service. We were seated next to the kitchen and can hear all the hustle and bustle.

This place has stolen my heart. It will always be known as the first date restaurant for me and my guy. It was our first time during restaurant week and loved the charming decor, low lighting and excellent service. It reminded us of sweet little Portland restaurants. 2 years later, I selected this place for my Check Please, AZ audition...and was chosen for a segment! It aired earlier this year and was so glad that such a local gem was able to showcase their talent. Unfortunately for us, the secret is out!   You must try the cocktails (ALL OF THEM) preferably the Ice Queen (vodka, my drink of choice), anything with bourbon in it and the wine selection is extensive and fantastic. Pricey, but fantastic, the scallops with corn 5 ways and the squid with chickpeas. The dishes are plated beautifully and the servers are great at recommending items if you have never dined with them before.  You can tell that the chefs take great care in the food they are putting out there and of course it is all cooked to perfection. Seasoning, sauces, sides were all scrumptious. It's in a great little spot next to the Bespoke Inn. Even though we are locals (I am a Native Arizonan) it makes you want to stay at the inn so you get to enjoy the restaurant for one more day.

PROS: Great patio seating, Refuge IPA, chicken confit wings, breakfast burger, chill atmosphere.   CONS: No longer on No Wait app, crappy parking, long waits, spotty service...can be a little hit or miss.  I have been to AZ Wilderness for lunch and dinner, with my SO and in a large group. I think they are expanding the restaurant. This was on a list for my Check, Please AZ segment and we really liked the beet burger and fries. My go to are the pork belly sliders and chicken confit wings with blue cheese dipping sauce. We like taking our friends from out of town and it's a fun brewery and is closer to us than Four Peaks. Tasty food and beer, can't go wrong.

For date night, we decided to try Harumi before the ballet in downtown. We were seated right in front of the sushi bar and right in front of the owner Juno, who quickly became our new best friend. We ordered sake, the Omakase (Chef's Choice), blue fin plate and Cali roll. The chef's choice had salmon nigiri, spicy salmon wrapped in pretty thin slices of avocado, toro, squid, octopus salad, it was all wonderful and beautiful!! Juno handed us a yellowtail sample that was light and citrusy that was on the house because he said I was too pretty. I shall take all the compliments and yummy sushi I can get! The blue fin plate even had little flecks of gold. Our server was very helpful and had nice recommendations which we appreciated as this was our first time aft the restaurant.   Juno checked on us a few times and was kind, asking us what we were up to this weekend. He's playful with his staff and greets and thanks all the customers that walk in. He was at the right level of in your face customer service.   Great date night, we highly recommend this place. Looking forward to our next visit.

We decided to stop by for a drink after dinner since our friend recommended this place. It was decorated like something out of a dreamy Pinterest board.  PROS: Great live music Tasty coffee Cute decorations Patio seating  CONS: Service was very underwhelming - she didn't say hi to us and just waited for us to order. My mangorito wasn't spectacular, it was cheap but didn't taste like anything  We didn't try any of the food since we just came for dinner. Maybe next time, we 'll stop in for a few bites. We noticed people on the patio playing board games but we were just enjoying the great weather and people watching,

Even though it is right next to Sapphire, we really enjoyed our first time at this restaurant. Loud music, Shakira playing on their TVs we were hydrating after day drinking so were just on a water mission.  This place has the best salsa verde of my life. Could not stop eating the free chips + diff salsas. We ordered the nachos which we annihilated Ino protein added) split the chicken enchiladas served with black beans and rice + al pastor (2) and carnitas (1) tacos. Out of these dishes, I would pick the enchiladas over the tacos. They pride themselves with being organic which is noble but the al pastor lacked the fatty flavor which I love in taquerias.   It slowed down when we dined around 10 PM and our food came out quick but our server Roark was a little spotty with service. It took a while to get our waters refilled and he didn't really check on us. Another female server came by to check on us to let us know that he stepped out for a moment. Tasty and fun atmosphere, we are fans.

We went for a drink during HH before our dinner reservation. When we arrived there was a little miscommunication with the host on this, it was a little annoying. Sitting at the bar, I ordered the house white and my guy ordered the house red. The bartender gave us both reds. I didn't say anything, I let it go. The wine was good so I didn't mind too much. He was chatty but VERY chatty I couldn't tell if he was having a nice conversation with all of the patrons or if it was condescending. Both of us thought this. Our friends arrived and then were seated. We wanted to try this place during restaurant week. My guy and I actually ordered the same meal, deviled eggs, steak with chimichurri and the bread pudding. My friends ordered the salad, cod and steak, ice cream cookies and bread pudding. The deviled eggs were the biggest disappointment. I am such a huge fan of them but they were so mediocre. I should have chosen something else. The steak was rare just as I ordered it, it was good but I have had better. The bread pudding was very tasty and came in a cute mini cast iron pot. The server was present but he wasn't fantastic. Bottom line - no one at the table was wowed by the service or food. The only thing that stands out is the very cute decor and we loved the table in the middle that slides in ad out for larger parties. We decided that we won't be revisiting this restaurant for dinner, maybe for only HH.

My guy and I work at Intel right down to the street and we decided to try this place for lunch. I haven't been here since it was the Sushi Room. Pretty much same decor and same vibe.  We both ordered bento boxes, mine was the Korean BBQ and his was the salmon served with white rice as well. The miso soup was a very generous serving and wasn't too salty. The bento came with a very tasty and perfectly spiced squid salad, mixed greens and a 3 piece California roll. My lunch was very tasty the beef was very flavorful and super charbroiled just the way I like it. His salmon was tasty with a glaze and we both finished our meals. Not much to complain about food wise. There is a patio and we enjoyed the weather before the tough AZ summer hits. The service was fine, the girls were attentive and our water glasses were never empty.  I am trying this place this week for HH so let's see how it goes! Might be a little more fun and crowded as it was kind of sparse during lunch.

We had a comped stay and meal at the Graduate Hotel. We decided to do a staycation during the Tour de Fat weekend. When we checked in it was a very cute retro room and had great style. I had to request different towels because I found a hair on them....the room was no as clean as what I would have liked.   It was a little dusty and there was so candy wrappers by the sliding door. I was not that impressed. The only positive things I can say is that it has a great look but beyond that, we would never come back.

Service was slow, the french toast was underwhelming. The only positive things was the cute decor and the cheese curds. It's just a okay place for Brunch.

4 of us went for Friday lunch. It is a convenient area since we all work at Intel.  I am very big on 1st impressions. We were not greeted properly when we went to the front to order. She just stood there waiting for us to say something. Not even a smile. I ordered the eggplant parm sandwich and she said they ran out. It was 11:30 AM and they already ran out? Poor supply chain. She wasn't apologetic or anything. I ordered the prosciutto and asiago sandwich, my friends ordered meatball sandwiches, chicken parm sandwich, pasta salad, and lobster bisque. There is very little seating and really hot outside, with no misters by the way, so we decided to order to go. I was already annoyed by the Russian girl who took our order and when my friend wanted some more info on the cheesecake she said she had no idea about the cheesecake. This was going to be tough, I just knew it. He ordered the Italian cheesecake and that was the only thing that I enjoyed eating at this deli.  My prosciutto sandwich was boring and underwhelming. I had bite of the chicken parm and there was nothing special about it. The pasta salad was really sad looking, not a ton of veggies and it had too much dressing. Was not a fan.The soup of the day, lobster bisque, was not a bisque. At all. It was just a thin tomato soup with rubbery lobster. We waited a long time for the food in the small cramped place hovering over people while they had lunch. It was claustrophobic and I will probably never eat here again. It's worth the drive from here to Di Falco's. Just go there.

We love this cute mom and pop Peruvian restaurant. It's a little cheesy with the mural and paper place mats but it's still sweet and a little charming. Our faves are the Ceviche Mixto with scallops, squid, shrimp and white fish. Lots of sauce on top with corn and yams.   Our other go to are the different rice specialty dishes the Lomo a Caballo is with beef, sauteed veggies and plantain chips. We always order an extra side of the plantain chips since they are that good. The owner is adorable and welcomes compliments as we walk out of the restaurant. Sometimes, when the place is packed for dinner service can be a little slow but it's just because it's usually just 1 server. We don't mind waiting a little for our drinks to refill in return for dinner and leftovers. Thanks Tumi!

Close to Intel and had a lunch date - Buffet is the only option and you can't order from the menu. The staff was pretty friendly and tons of options.  Pros: eggplant dish briyani rice was great and lots of it! dosa comes with naan as well multiple levels of spice - it wasn't just all spicy pitcher of water at the table  Cons: Could not order off the menu - craving Gobi manchurian that day!  after drinking our entire pitcher, slow to refill that waters after that

The green chili chimichanga is my fave! It's a cute little lunch spot. Counter service but it can be pretty busy. The remodel is better and they improved the parking lot as well. Will have to try their other dishes as well. It's a very low maintenance, no frills Mexican place. The churros were quite tasty as well.

The owner recognized me from his other restaurant, Cyprus Grill. Great space, beautifully decorated. We went for HH and tasted the garlicy Ivy fries and spanokopita. The spanokopita could have been a little flakier. We had red and white sangria and it wasn't overly sweet.   We stayed for dinner and that is when the place started to really fill up. Around 6 PM on Friday night, there was a DJ. He played trendy remixes and it wasn't overwhelming loud at all.   For dinner, I ordered the seabass and he ordered the lampchops. My seabass was melty and had a light crust on it. It was over this olive oil and balsamic sauce. I devoured it since seabass is my favorite. He likes to call them lamb lollipops and they were. Instead of potatoes that usually come with it he requested the kale salad, which the server obliged to. The kale was very lemony and it was a quite a large "side" salad. There wasn't any food left and since we participated in HH we didn't have enough tummy room for dessert. The few cocktails each was more than enough.   I have to say, I have hopes that The Ivy will stock around. The space used to be a Thai place that didn't last very long. It's a great space for work HH or group dinners, as I saw there was a private dining room in the back. It is new but there wasn't a ton of hiccups with regards to service. The hostesses were pleasant and my server was as well. You can tell the owner runs a tight ship since he seemed very engaged with the staff throughout the evening.  Looking forward to our next visit to The Ivy.

The service has really declined. We came for happy hour before 6 but waitress did not grant happy hour special on apps, since it showed 6:18pm. Just because she rang it up after is not our problem. Then, she said "Well, your wine came up as HH." Shouldn't everything be then?   Servers are all different and can see why the place is half empty for happy hour and dinner. Such a disappointment, will take our business elsewhere.

Group of 6 went for Sunday night dinner. The place has a pretty cool, modern ambiance. The menu looked tasty, but no one had any alcohol due to the night before. Iced teas and waters for everyone!  Then...Mike the Server happened to us. I had to ask for chips and salsa because apparently you have to ask for that first they don't bring it to you automatically. That was unappealing. He stacked too many salsa bowls on the serving platter and spilled salsa over my friend. It was on the table and floor as well. They were cleaning it up and salsa buddy went to go get cleaned up. Mike the Server (MTS) then walked to the other side of the booth and spilled a bowl of the chips next to me on the table and floor. MTS was having a rough night. He communicated it was his 3rd day. Shocker.   I ordered the pozole and chile relleno. The pozole was way better than my entree. It was green salsa based and was very tasty. I shared it and had leftovers to take with me. The stuffing was better with the chile and was not breaded like other chile rellenos I have had. Not sure if I liked this version as much. Everyone else ordered enchiladas and my guy ordered the brisket. That brisket was very tasty with the pickled onions. Everyone had leftovers to take home as we filled ourselves with tasty chips and salsa. The manager came by and wasn't very apologetic like MTS. She made little snarky jokes to try to be funny but I wasn't that amused. MTS gave the table flan on him since, you know, he spilled everything on us and made the evening rocky. The flan was very dense and had a nice sauce with is. I had one bite and that was enough. My buddy did in fact earn it since it looked like he got shot.  Would I go again? Probably not. There are so many better restaurants in Downtown Gilbert with not only better food but better service. I understand it's a new place but I've already made up my mind. My advice: don't wear white to Barrio Queen.

Great HH specials! The 7 of us ordered delicious cocktails and Tiger/Tsingtao beer...  Everyone enjoyed the lettuce wraps (chicken and tofu), wings (takes ~20min), crab puffs, Mongolian beef and spring rolls. Everything was tasty! It is newer so a slight wait on our server as it got more busy for HH and dinner. It is a cute place and cannot wait to use the patio when it gets cooler. Expect us to go there again!

PH has used this space wonderfully - very modern and great energy. After having a drink at the bar while we were waiting for our large table, we ordered the chicken pot pie and mussels with fries. Very tasty but they should have put the fries on the side instead of making it soggy with it being in the same pot. We also shared the bacon wrapped dates and they were super yummy and flavorful, cooked to perfection served with a spring of herbs.  Cannot wait to come back and try other dishes! It's fun for a group event or to watch sports!

Very cool energy at the Ostrich. low lighting, fun music, booths and capacity for larger groups. It's nice to have this place in Downtown Chandler, great cocktails, tad pricey but worth it since they are generous with their pours. People ordered Manhattans, French 75 and others and there were no complaints. The bartenders definitely know what they are doing. Great talent on the servers as well - my guy friends were drooling all over them, so that's a bonus.   Would love to take folks from out of town next time.

Pros: Helpful with dress fittings and measurements and provided good feedback on what looked best on me. Good with communication as I emailed the owners to have the list of 6 dresses pulled for my appointment.  Cons: Closed on Sundays and Mondays and only does appointments Tuesday - Friday. Not very convenient on the weekends. Had to leave work a little early and was traffic-y to and from.

Spacious, well designed restaurant! This was my first time but my brother has dined here before. Loved the little apps, especially the daikon and potatoes. The server was kind enough to give us more. We ordered the Korean dumpling hot pot, spicy pork belly and hot stone bulgogi which had rice and mixed veggies as well. All dishes were very authentic and flavorable. My brother's favorite was the pork belly and it was pretty spicy but not overwhelming or painful. They also served white rice and purple rice which has more of a brown rice texture.   Lots of leftovers to take home for future lunches and dinners and we will try this place again. We think it'll be good fro groups!

We went during their grand opening this weekend as it was a 50% off deal. The line was exceptionally long but that's a good sign, right? After about 20 minutes in line, we were greeted by the super busy staff/assembly line and they were pleasant yet efficient. I ordered the regular with brown rice + 2 scoops of spicy tuna and octopus tossed in the citrus sweet sauce with crab salad, seaweed salad, cucumber, jicama, edamame, crispy onion and red onion sprinkled with sesame seeds. Such vibrant colors and flavors! My date ordered the large with brown rice with 3 scoops of regular tuna, salmon and octopus with all of the toppings + house spicy sauce (+roe, wasabi, ginger, chili peppers) minus the avocado/crab salad since it was $1/each extra. His tuna was in larger chunks and he said that was his favorite protein in the bowl. The place was pretty packed but we sat at the window in the corner which was fine by me as there were traffic jams through the restaurant. For AZ standards this is very tasty seafood and the best part was that our total bill was $10.62. Great taste and prices and if we are ever around in Scottsdale this will be a main contender for a quick and cheap pit stop.
