I've never left a bad review before but I was extremely disappointed in my experience in the bar of The Keg in Tempe Wednesday night. While I must say our server was fantastic, everything else was blah.   I met some friends for drinks and appetizers. The first drink I had was the Orange Slice. I've had this in the past at a different Keg location and enjoyed it. But this time, I thought I could taste the chlorinated Phoenix water in the drink. I didn't say anything to our server but I decided to order a different drink the next round. My second drink was an Old Fashioned. This drink is made with bourbon, bitters, lemon, orange, sugar and soda. So I couldn't understand why it tasted extremely watered down. This time I said something to the server. I thought it might be the soda water that had ruined these drinks. She checked with the manager and then returned recommending I avoid a drink made with soda. The manager did not stop by. I sent the drink back and ordered a Manhattan. The Manhattan is described on the menu as being made with bourbon, vermouth, and "house-made drunken Bing cherries". Cherries. Plural. The drink arrived with a single MARASCHINO cherry. Not the house-made cherries I was expecting and looking forward to. This drink also tasted watered down, as if it sat in the mixer cup over ice much too long. My friend ordered a spiked tea. It, too, was extremely watered down! I blame the bartender for our disappointing experience. One of my friends had a steak and was quite pleased with her meal. In the future, IF I ever do return to this restaurant, I will only choose wine or beer because the bartender either does not know how to make cocktails, or she was skimping on listed ingredients to save the restaurant money.

I had a wonderful experience with Ideal Image. I did a lot of research before choosing this facility to have laser hair removal performed. Everyone that I encountered during my 10 visits was incredibly kind, sensitive and professional. Yes, the prices here are little higher than what I found elsewhere but it's definitely true that you get what you pay for. It's a laser! It can be dangerous if used improperly. It was clear that the nurse who worked with me truly cared about my results and my satisfaction. I am incredibly happy with my results!

This place is close to my work and I was told I had to get the strawberries there. That was great advice. I went in on my lunch break for some berries and was happily surprised to see that there is also a lunch counter in the back. The women working at the counter, however, don't seem too happy about it. They all seem flustered and are brusque and impatient with the customers ordering their lunch. I shrugged it off the first time I went there. My sandwich was great. I ordered the half sandwich and soup combo. Looking at my receipt later, I feel like I was overcharged. Well, maybe I wasn't very clear with my order because I felt rushed by the woman taking my order.   I returned a couple of weeks later during my lunch hour. I planned to order one sandwich to go, for a coworker, and my own sandwich that I planned to eat in the restaurant. The line moved forward and the customer in front of me had just ordered. As he was putting his money away, the woman taking orders leaned over and took the order from the man BEHIND me! Apparently he was a regular because she knew his order. She was still writing his order down as the man in front of me walked away and I waited for her attention. She sent in the order for the man behind me and then looked at me to take my order. I ordered my two meals, one to go, one to stay, paid and took my ticket with my number to a table to wait. I listened for my number to be called as people who ordered before me, including the man behind me, got their meals. Then I noticed several people who ordered after me getting their meals. After 25 minutes of waiting, I walked up to the counter to check on it. My meal, the one I had ordered to eat in, was boxed up and sitting under the counter. The other order was still waiting on homemade chips. 5 minutes later that order was boxed up. I waited 30 minutes for 2 meals! The woman bagged up the sandwiches and gave me an apologetic shrug as she handed them to me.  I may be back for the strawberries. But I will NOT return to the lunch counter! That was TERRIBLE customer service. They certainly won't be gaining any new "regulars" treating people the way I felt I was treated.

Awesome experience! The bar and wait staff were attentive and friendly despite the huge Saturday night crowd. The band was phenomenal! I'll be making the trek from Scottsdale to enjoy this establishment very soon!

I had a great time at Hi Fi. I met a friend there for midweek Happy Hour which, by the way, runs until 7pm. The service was excellent! Our server was friendly and attentive, the manager stopped by to check on us and the bartender was very generous with their pours. After my great experience, I was surprised to read the poor reviews here on Yelp. Perhaps we just got the best server in the restaurant. I'll definitely be going back soon for another Adult Milk Shake!

I was REALLY disappointed with our service last night. It was a Monday night so it wasn't very busy. My friend and I ordered a charcuterie board, which arrived in a timely manner. Our waitress, while polite, set it down and turned to walk away. We stopped her asking her to explain all the items. She did not know much of what we'd been served. Another waitress came by to help and she wasn't very familiar with the items either. I ordered a glass of wine, one that is on tap and listed on the menu for $7. Our waitress disappeared. Quite a bit of time went by and I did not see her so I flagged down the bartender. He brought me my drink with apologies. Another friend joined us and nobody came by to greet her so we flagged down the second server, who appeared to be on break. Eventually our server came by again and we ordered a round of drinks. This time I ordered a slightly more expensive glass of wine that was not on tap. Soon after, we saw our drinks sitting on the bar. After some time passed, the bartender delivered them with apologies again. I was given the wrong glass of wine. Once I realized this, I walked up to the bar to get what I'd ordered. Given that our server was absent the majority of the time, I'd assumed she'd ordered it incorrectly. But when our bill came, the items on the bill were correct. The bartender had poured me the cheaper glass of wine and I was still being charged for the more expensive glass. Not everyone would recognize this mistake so I felt as though he was intentionally trying to rip me off. And then that first $7 glass of wine showed up on the bill as $8. I wouldn't normally complain over a dollar, but given the series of circumstances that occurred during the night, I felt like we were intentionally being mistreated. The bartender said he'd fix the mistake.   When I receive awful service, I don't want to return to the establishment. I've been a server. I understand everybody has bad days. But I felt like all 3 people waiting on us made our night stressful. Stress is exactly what we are trying to escape when my friends and I go out together. I don't think I'll ever return to EVO.

The flavors of the food are fantastic! The truck was parked in the parking lot of my work during lunch. There was a bit of a line given that it was just after noon, but the wait for my food wasn't very long... Maybe ten minutes. However, I think they may have been short on a few ingredients. I ordered the Cajun Crabcake slider, the Brazilian Churrasco Steak slider and the side of Crispy Brussels Sprouts. I nearly inhaled the crabcake slider. The texture was perfect and it wasn't too spicy. The steak slider was not served with the crispy plantain that was listed as an ingredient but the serving size of steak was quite large. The Brussels sprouts did not seem to have any bacon in them, also listed as an ingredient. I also thought there was supposed to have been pecans in them. Maybe it's just a pecan flavor in the glaze. But despite what was missing, I truly loved all the flavors and will likely eat at Street Spice again in the near future.

My friend and I had such a great experience at Eggstasy! We made reservations for brunch on a Saturday, late morning. When we arrived, we were quickly seated. Every employee that greeted us seemed genuinely friendly. They were attentive without being overbearing. And the menu! Oh, the menu! So many unique options! It took us quite a while to make up our minds. We decided on sharing a sweet and a savory dish. Our fantastic server Elena split our dish for us. We shared the quinoa, kale and sun-dried tomato omelette and splurged on the pumpkin cheesecake pancakes. Wonderful choices! The pancakes weren't too sweet. My friend got the fresh-squeezed orange juice. I had coffee which was served with real cream. The carafe of water on our table had cucumber in it. Every detail was perfect! I wish I had discovered this place earlier! I'll be back soon. I want to try the chocolate covered bacon!
