Ahhhhhh.  This place was a bright spot in the somewhat shitty ass time I had finding a good place to grab a drink, watch some sports and eat some good food.  This place had all three, not to mention a COMPETENT staff who actually believe the customer is right.  Go figure.    I stop in across from the conference which had wrapped up earlier.  I ask about drink specials.  The bartender apologized, since she had forgotten what it was, but within a minute she told me it was strawberry vodka lemonade.  Well, that sounds fantastic.  So I had that and a strawberry fields salad, which was this glorious field of greens with strawberries, feta and walnuts, with a strawberry vinaigrette.  Oh, hell yes.  This is what mama needed.  They also understand that hey, we're like five feet away from the local sports arenas, and we're named after a local sports god, let's get some good shit up!  And lo and behold the Rangers playoff game was on.  Well all righty.  No one was moving me at that point.  I also got to try their cheese fries.  It's real cheese, but the fries were just ok.  They were the super skinny fries but the flavoring was good.    After the shitty time I had with food in this region, this place was awesome and I would just go back SPECIFICALLY for the salad, that's how good it was.

AVOID AT ALL COSTS.  Baja Fresh is a poor man's chipotle, but that's an insult to poor men everywhere.  First off, I think everyone in Phoenix is missing the gene where they actually listen to directions.  When you order something, you shouldn't get ANOTHER.  Totally got that, it ruined the start of my vacation and it made me sick the entire time I was in Phoenix.  Ironically, I never stepped into a Baja before, but I learned my lesson to eat dirt rather than eat here.  I ordered a burrito bowl (I think it's called "bare" burrito), and I asked for whatever the hell it was, and you have to special order steak or chicken.  I said neither but Iwanted guac.  No problem they told me.  I hate chicken and I got it anyway.  I didn't know until I got back to my conference.  Note to self: they fuck you in the drive-thru.  Anyway, it wasn't even that GOOD.  And it made me sick.  Did I mention that?  I don't totally blame Baja though.  Chipotle did its part in pissing me off for the whole trip.  Baja unfortunately just fell out of my butt hours later.

I was last at this place in 2004, and it was great.  My favorite band was playing and I had a great time dancing, drinking and just listening to music.  It's a must-see for any rhythm and blues fan.  Of course, it wasn't open when I just visited.  Ah well.  But still a good place to catch a show.

DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY TIME OR ENERGY COMING HERE.  No.  Seriously.  Stop it.  Don't even think about it.    Okay, if you must, don't do any of the tours.  It's nothing you really can't figure out on your own and at least then it's free.  The triple-tour (the train, the mine tour and funhouse) were $18.  Buying two tours is $16 - so if you want to do all three it sounds like a good deal.    I know nothing about this area.  And I could have given a better tour than these toothless backwards and racist rednecks.  1) The train tour - took them about 5 minutes before they acknowledged I even wanted to buy a ticket.  I'm sorry - can you smell my feminist liberalism from NYC?  2) the train was cute but was not educational at all.  The guy was kind of an asshole and know it all by not telling you anything at all, then wanted tips.    3) The mine tour was not fun AT ALL.  The tour guide was terrible and an idiot.  My personal favorite was when he started to slam President Obama.  Look, I could give a shit what your political leanings are and you have every right to dislike the president.  But I could give a rat's ass what you think when you voted for Bush twice.  Moving right along, he says "I'll move if he's re-elected."  Good luck in Mexico - you hate Mexicans!  And Canada is far more socially liberal.  Like I said, good luck but I guarantee in 2017, he'll still be there.  If he's still alive.  Asshole.  By the way, that's the only thing I retained on that stupid tour.  Not worth time, money or energy.  4) The mystery house was kind of cool, I guess, but again, the guy was a real dickweed.  Is there a dickweed gene in Phoenix that has yet to be identified?  Because there is a HUGE sample set, at least in the people I met.  5) Everything else was kind of nondescript.  If you have a lot of time to kill and you're in Phoenix, trust me...take the extra two hours total in round trip travel and go to Sedona for better pictures, vibes and jeep tours.  Don't do it.    PS I thought a ghost town would be eerier.  I didn't get that feeling at all.  It was kind of hokey and dumb.

I came, I saw.  Feh, I was unimpressed.  The two star rating Meh I've experienced better was the closest to that sentiment, so that's that.  So let's go over the pros: it's in the downtown area, it's close to the old "Igloo" where the Penguins used to play, close to the new Fill-in-the-blank Energy Arena (forget the name)...close to businesses (think I saw a convention center there?).    Pretty pathetic though for a hotel to offer "shuttle service" to major city points (such as PNC Park, which was what I was there for) and a) only have ONE operating on the weekends (while several things were going on in town) and b) not run after game nights?  What gives?  now, I understand that around the stadium, it's tough to pick up since it's mostly pedestrian only and one of the draws to the area.  But something's gotta give.  Luckily, I'm a New Yorker, I walk everywhere, and it was about a mile away from the stadium.  But it was raining and I was none too happy.  What else?  I got this as a Priceline deal, so I guess beggars can't  be choosers.  Room was good, I was there for only an overnight...will i be back there?  I'll visit Pittsburgh again sooner rather than later, but this place? Never. Again.

^shrug^  I stayed out by this place.  It was basically the only gig in town besides the hotel bar and well, that was just a sad sight.  So we came here.  I had a nice salad, some greens with feta and walnuts.  A glass of sauvignon blanc.  Bartenders are bitchy.  Is that some kind of prerequisite in Phoenix?  You have to be douche or a bitch?  Hands down, Phoenix takes the prize.

Waste of money.  The tours were nondescript and the tour guide works for tips and but doesn't act like it.  The tours in Sedona are far superior.  I guess this place figures it's the only gig in town so they'll charge what they want and not care.  Well, bye.

YES THIS IS THE STUFF RIGHT HERE LOOK NO FURTHER FOR AUTHENTIC INDIAN ART JEWELRY   Well, okay.  I went here by default because Chief Dodge was CLOSED on Sundays.  Sigh.  Chief Dodge has the nicest selection, staff and they always remember me (though I haven't been there in 8 years, but I swear, they'd remember me).  Anyway I struck up a conversation with the lady, Diane, who works here.  Turns out, she also lived in New York back in the day.  She was incredibly helpful and patient, and I bought a nice pair of earrings from her.  When I am back in town, I will definitely go back to check the merch.  Thank you for a lovely experience!!

Siiiiiiiiiigh.   IN N OUTTTTTTTTT  This was a good In N Out, as far as In N Outs go.  The fries were probably some of the best.  And I love the burgers, nuff said.  Even if I didn't have the bad food experiences I had in Phoenix that weekend, this took the prize of being the best experience.  NOM.

Um.    Happy hour specials on the board.  Fine enough.  I was attending a conference across the street so it went without saying we'd try this joint.  I first ask if I can charge my phone somewhere.  Lazy asshole douchecanoe bartender lazily waves in the direction and says "Power strip over there."  Over where?  I figure it out but guess what.  NO POWER SOURCE.  I know this is first world problems but seriously WHAT THE FUCK PHOENIX NOTHING FUCKING WORKS IN THIS CITY.  So I order the $4 margarita.  It was ok, nothing special. They also seem to have some kind of happy hour food special, like free apps by the non-functioning power strips.   They have two TVs in the joint.  Mind you, this place is like 3 feet from Chase Field and US Airways Arena where the Dbacks and Suns play, respectively.  You'd think they would invest in a package to get out of market games.  Nope.  Now, if you want like local softball teams from Joe's beer league, knock yourself out, but I asked about MLB and they were like "no."  Not even an explanation.  Well fuck you too.  Between the attitude from the bartender (he was such an asshole), the owners (I presume they were the owners) know-it-all righteousness, the bitchy waitresses, well fuck this place in the ass.  I give them an extra star because the margarita wasn't bad.  Oh and the bathrooms were clean and they at least had toilet paper.  Trust me, in Phoenix you can't leave things to chance.

OMG I loved this place! I wish I could have tried more food on the menu, but I guess that will be next time I visit Old Town Scottsdale :).  The happy hour specials are every day, $3.50 margaritas.  Aye carumba!  They were big too.  I was hungry and they have 1/2 price apps.  I didn't order any but got a fajita salad which comes in this ginormous taco shell.  It was SO GOOD and I had the best dressing, creamy jalapeno.  It even had hockey playoffs on - Pittsburgh vs Philly.  I'm in love, I'm all shook up.

Siiiiigggh.  This place is no longer, or at least I couldn't tell you it was opened.  It looked abandoned.  But man I am so upset.  Back in the dizzay, I was known to have a few cosmos, sit in a lounger, and dance with the house band to "Brick Howse."  in fact, my friends often call Brick House my song because of this legendary status.  Sad to report Chez Nous is no longer, and that makes me very sad :(

HEY CHIPOTLE!  Here's a big BRONX CHEER and big middle finger to you.  You totally ruined my trip and attitude merely hours in my time in Phoenix.  Know why?  You ran out of goddamn guacamole before 1 pm.  BEFORE ONE PM.  IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK.  ARE YOU FOR REALZ?  I waited in line, which by the way would have moved a lot faster if not for the incompetence behind the counter.  I waited in line, patiently, figuring I'd get my burrito bowl in no time.  I swear, Chipotle workers just work SLOWER so as for people to buy into the hype for their product (they do that here in NYC so it's no different).  So as I order, I say I'd like the veggie bowl.  Veggie bowls come with guac.  Don't you think THEN would have been a good time for them to mention - oh, hey, by the way, sorry for the inconvenience but we're actually OUT of guac.  Nope!  I find out only when I'm about to finish my order.  I left because I was so disappointed.  You people BLOW!  Now, the worst part is that because of this snafu I had to go to the far less superior Baja Fresh.  I was sick them entire weekend because of this meal.  All because Chipotle didn't have the common decency to have guacamole or enough.  I mean, isn't that your JOB??? To have INVENTORY???  What the FUCK? Meanwhile, this set off a chain of events that I didn't get ONE of my food orders right when I was there.    So a big FUCK YOU to Phoenix central Chipotle.  I will never set foot in here again, which I guess is good for you because I don't live there.  But unfortunately I am an elite reviewer on Yelp so sucks for you that I had a bad experience. #BlameChipotle

I am from Jersey.  I know good pizza.  This was just okay.  This place did well in a pinch.  But not saying much.  It's frickin PHOENIX, not exactly a hotbed of pizza choices.  I had a red creme Barq's though.  That was the best part.
