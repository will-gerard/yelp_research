Awesome steakhouse deserving of the 5 stars for the atmosphere/service and the chateubriand for two.  First, the atmosphere.  If cowboys went to a black tie dinner, they would feel right at home here - formal yet rustic at the same time.  Nice dim lighting, great for a date (my wife agreed).  Service was phenomenal - prompt, courteous, just attentive enough without getting overwhelming.  I am still not sure whether the complimentary veggie plate or the awesome cornbread were on our table when we sat down or if they were brought out later but they were already there when I wanted them at just the right temperature.  Now on to the chateaubriand - to me this is their staple as I have not seen this cut in Arizona yet.  This is basically a large cut of tenderloin, too large for one person, hence offered on a large plate cut for two with different veggies, potatoes and mushrooms.  To me this was the best non-Kobe steak I've head in a long time - tender as a filet mignon but with more meat flavor.  My wife and I were barely able to finish it just because of the sheer amount of food - but it was so amazing that we did.  I've heard that things at this place can be hit or miss, but to me the chateaubriand is an awesome hit, so can't go wrong with this.  Throw in the amazingly attentive service and the nice atmosphere and this is one great steakhouse to visit.

You don't have to be a pothead to like this place, I promise!  You just have to like really good sandwiches, which this place offers in spades.  I am a big fun of the White Widow - chicken, cheese, all kind of toppings, and ask for the special chipotle mayo.  Oh yeah.  Awesome lunch spot every day.  No brownies included.

It's rare I give anything one star as I tend to be very forgiving.  And I like food.  And I really like island food and boba.  And I gave this place about 12 chances.  But...  The food is always semi-bland and the boba drinks are a complete bust every time.  Sometimes you get a cup half full with ice and the other half something resembling syrup.  Other times the consistency seems ok but there is no flavor whatsoever.  And the boba is crunchy in the middle half the time - I wonder if that's what happens to really old boba...  Anyways, go to a real boba place and avoid this one.

Let me start by saying that a part of me wishes I did not come her for the All You Can Eat, because my score might have been a lot better.  However, AYCE is what I will rate this place on, and our experience was a dishonest disaster.  In a nutshell, an AYCE it is not.  Once we sat down and ordered it for $20 per person, we were informed that the AYCE is limited to 5! orders of nigiri per person and the rest can only be rolls.  Bad.  Next we were told that AYCE only included "things in bold boxes".  The selection was laughable - the only nigiri that counted was salmon, tuna, whitefish, crab, and smelt roe. Roll selection was slightly better.  Seriously?  We were informed for about 5 minutes about the "rules" they had - leave 1 piece of roll, pay $1, leave a kitchen item, pay 1/2 price, leave a nigiri rice, pay full price.  These "rules" are also all over the bar area.   By the time the fish was brought out, I was pretty annoyed.  It didn't help that the nigiri had the biggest pieces of rice and the smallest pieces of fish I had ever seen.  When I commented to the waitress that the AYCN was actually not AYCN, I got a lecture that their fish is so good that they have to limit it.  Funny.  I got the impression that the owners were extremely cheap and someone told them to do AYCE for marketing but they really, really, really don't want you to get it and if you do, they treat you like you are trying to steal from them.  A real pity, since the fish quality was quite good and they had some rare specials on the menu like abalone, blue fin, and monk fish liver.  So 1 star for tasty fish, 1 star for everything else.  If you are looking for AYCN for now, look elsewhere like Orient Sushi or Takamatsu within a 1-2 mile radius.  Hopefully the owners read some of these reviews of AYCE and change their ways or even get rid of the fake AYCE altogether.

As someone who has lived in Spain and loves the culture and the food, I am picky about my Iberian culinary adventures.  And as much as you'd think tapas would be a fantastic choice for a meal, for one reason or another the whole concept often tends to get lost in translation with the food barely resembling its Spanish counterpart.  Having been disappointed by another Spanish restaurant in Scottsdale that I won't name here, I was cautious about Papa Frita as I got there for my birthday.    Luckily the place was a pleasant surprise!  The mood was great, great lighting and atmosphere.  Our party of 20+ was accommodated with no problems and set at a large table in the middle of the floor.  Flamenco dancing was in full swing.  We settled for a taster menu and got about half a dozen different tapas each leading up to the seafood paella.  While the bill was pretty pricey (may be 3x what it would have cost in Spain), it was pretty much in line or even a bit less than a typical Spanish restaurant.  Overall, good stuff.  Great for very large parties too, as it's difficult to find places like this in Scottsdale.

If you judged a book by its cover, you probably would not consider going into this sushi joint flanked by a movie theater and a Starbucks.  Luckily, if you are here, you like to get input from fellow foodies.  And as you can see - this is the place to go for sushi!  What makes this place great are the creative offerings and the super friendly service.  Start off with the House edamame (special hot sauce).  Then continue on to the very creative rolls.  Surf 'n turf was a fantastic fusion of steak and spicy fish while yellowtail lover was one of the best yellowtail rolls I've ever had.  But the crowning achievement was the appropriately named What the Heck roll - a mix of a whole bunch of stuff that translated into hot deliciousness.    I heard the tempura ice-cream here was great too, but we were too full from the great sushi this time.  Definitely one of the top sushi places in the Valley.

One of the best tasting phos in the Valley!  Very flavorful and abundant choices on the fillings - from tripe to tendon, flank, steak, meatballs, and so on.  Just the right ration of noodles to broth and veggies available upon request.    Very weird music selection (in a good way) - 80's and 90's music that seems odd in a Vietnamese place, but no complaints here.  The minus 1 star is for the hit-and-miss service.  Sometimes you get a decent waiter.  Other times you get a stoner that messes up almost everything on your order.  Be more selective in your hiring and you get the full five stars from me.
