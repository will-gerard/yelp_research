Absolutely the worst car wash I've ever had. Swindled into the detail, high pressure, long wait times. Didn't clean the tires or wheels and I had to do it myself when I got home. I wouldn't have paid $10 for the job they did. Please to do not waste your time or money.

Absolute worst waste of money ever, and it was basically free. We did the wine tasting dinner, and it was a decent price, and it was awful. The wine "expert" so rude, arrogant, and not pleasant whatsoever. I do not recommend this place. Spend more money to have a better vacation experience. Shuttles were always late. Rooms were okay. For a staycation, there is much better in Phoenix. If you are paying for this as a vacation rental, please look further. Worst ever! And in a great part of town! Not impressed.

Food is good. Service is absolutely wretched and the staff have poor manners. Would not recommend this location. For better and kinder service, try the Filmore Vig.

Room was not ready at 4:30pm, staff was rude and unhelpful, sat in a lobby of pissed people for an hour, and not one offer to make our frustration better. Poor service, smelled like smoke, and not worth the money. Wish I had known beforehand.

These guys are amazing! Awesome staff! Awesome workout! Awesome trainers! I have so much fun and work harder than any other workout in town. Well worth the money. Great schedule with several options each day. Try it out!

Your Art Party helped us raise money for a charity by sharing proceeds from our party. The event was a blast, the instructor was awesome, and the experience was so special for our friends. If you are looking for something unique, fun, and creative to do as a group event give them a call. I would work with them again in a heartbeat.
