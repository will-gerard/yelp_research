Olive garden is basically the cheap and fast food for Italian.  If you're expecting fine dining Italian, not the place, you're better off at Brio.  But if you want no non-sense, dirt cheap food at fast service, Olive Garden fills that roll.    They always have specials going on, so its best to go for that.  I went for 2 for $25.  That's unlimited soup and also salad, 2 entrees and your choice of desert or appetizer.  Salad is alright, just a house salad nothing special and also you can choose from 4 different soups and you change your soups.  I tried 3 of them.  They're not the best soups but they're not bad.  It is what is.  The entrees are alright too, good portions, the Seafood Lasagna had actual seafood and even the scallops are real and plentiful. which was surprising to me.  Overall the quality and taste are sup-par nothing special.   But you already knew that.  everything is on the cheesy side if anything.     As long as you come go to Olive Garden with the right expectations, fast italian for cheap, you'll have a good dinner and a good experience.  If you're expecting fancy high class authentic Italian... you  will be disapointed  Pro Cheap italian food good selection unlimited soup and salad  Con generic tasting soups and pasta

The best Korean bbq in the east valley...dare I proclaim... Takamatsu is deff in the top Korean bbq. But what puts Taka ahead of others is 3 things, size of portions, ability to grill your own meat, and cheap cheap sushi.   The only con I can think of Taka is the price. But that is expected of any Korean bbq. But if you are going to pay $15 plus for kalbi or bulgulgi, it better be good.  Taka has the option that you can cook your meat at the table, a 2 meat dish min is required.  But I prefer to have someone else do the dirty work.  Both the Kalbi or the Bulgulgi are excellent.  The meat is just right, soft and not chewy and marinated to the bone.  Always comes in a cute "cow shaped" hot plate.  And the sides are always different and plentiful.  My faves are the kimchi and the pickled cucumber.  And you can ask for a refill on the side dishes.  I've tried a multiple of their soups and they're all good also.  One thing is they have a fresh sushi bar at the place also. Not only that, they have it as reasonable prices.  Most of the rolls are under $10.  I had the Baked Scallop Roll (my gauge to how good the sushi place is) and it was big, and the scallops were actually baked (seperately) and  had its own sauce.    With that in mind, Takamatsu is by far the best bang for your buck for Korean BBQ.  I'm sure you'll agree to after you've tried it.  Pros: Good sized portions can cook your meat at the table SUSHI- good sushi and cheap food always good prompt service  Cons you'll smell like Korean BBQ chopsticks are a lil uncomfortable to hold.

It was my 2nd time there so i kind of knew what to expect.  Practically the only Vegan place around town, unless you count those Ethiopian places.  But i like green for the effort, tastes, and ambiance.  The variety is pretty good ranging from salads, pizzas, burgers, "po-boys" and noodles.  This time i had the Mexicali burger and my lady friend had the spicy peanut sause noodles (with is pretty much like a Thai noodle bowl, with mock-chicken).  The burger was sup-par.  the patty was more of a ground meat texture than a patty so it broke apart easily.  The flavor wasnt really there and it took ketchup and siracha sauce to bring it up.  The fries however very very good.  Thin cut, light and crispy.  Definitely a highlight of that meal.  as for the Thai noodles, it was pretty good too. The mock chicken was very good. not too dry and had a good texture to it...dare i say almost like chicken.  My only complaint is the price.  You really dont get for what you pay for.  the portions  are a lil small and the tofu/mock meat are far and few in between.  but still relatively inexpensive to eat, all entrees are about $10.  but we could get a lil more fries, or noodles or vegies for that much.  another complaint was didnt save enough room for the tsoynami ice creams they looked absolutely delish.  next time... next time  Pros -only vegan in town -flavorful with a good selection of dishes -cute decor   Cons: -meals a lil small for $10, but not that bad.

This place is what you would call "quaint".  has a boutique feel to it.  Hard to find even though it is located in the hot spot of Gilbert (right across the street from Postinos).  The place is small but the food is good and authentic.  The menu is HUGE and overwhelming.  Its really amazing how big their menu is when their kitchen is not the biggest.  I guess you cant say that they have a particular taste or menu other than European.  The dishes are pretty big and hearty and the prices are decent.  Definitely a good restaurant to goto if you want a change of pace and something different then the box restaurants. And the dessert menu/selection is GINORMOUS! and very delish with a big variety from Chocolate, creme brule, carrot cake, cheese cake and they rival that of fancier bakeries.  Pros -fresh and authentic food -big selection of food -good service and knowledgeable staff -BIG DESSERT MENU -they have wine tasting nights (call to find out more)  Cons -small, deff not a good place for big parties -overwhelming menu -dessert menu will DESTROY YOUR DIET PLANS

This last time was meh.  Service was meh, didnt get greeted, just took my order. (typical though) but this time it took a lil longer than usual to make.  plus the drinks were also meh, not very good for the milk tee and the slush was too artificial tasting.  is it too much to ask for a decent tasting DRINK?!??!?!  PRO: - the boba itself is always perfect, nice and soft and chewy  Cons -everything else is meh.

If you're looking for a nice sports bar that is a step up from Natives or Buffalo Wild wings, this is your place.  Natives and BWW are nice when you want the down and dirty bare bones experience like in your college days for wings and such.  But now you're not in college, time to upgrade your sports bar and palate. LOTS of TV with lots of channels for sports.  Big bar area with TVs or booth seating for just family dining.  The menu for food is impressive, the burgers are big and juicy, wings are ok. fries are ok.  But they have just a big menu for everything and the quality tastes just better then Natives or BWW.  The beer selection is good, and for mixed drinks they're decent.  And its CLEAN!  Pros: -LOTS OF TVS (think wall to wall) -good food (esp the burgers) -big selections of beer -spacious bar and regular dining area  Cons: -CLOSES AT EARLY (or earlier than most) - gets very crowded during big games so there might be a wait -parking lot can get full real quick

One word that describes Thai Spices is "meh".    Located in MeKong Plaza, it took over the old BoCa 7 space.  When walking in the place, you'll notice its nice decor.  alas, it was left behind by the previous tenant (yes that is real gold wall paper fyi).  The place was quiet for a Friday night and we came there for my bday.  Apparently happy hour is extended till 7:30pm but its not stated or noted anywhere.  Since we had a big party, we ordered a multiple of their appetizers.  The most notable ones are surprisingly not thai related.  The crab puffs were very unique and good as well as the calamari rings.  Who would of thought the secret sause (thousand island) would make a diffrence.  After that, everything pretty much went down hill from there.  The thai dishes were not very good.  We had the pad thai, a little on the sweet side, plus the portions are a little small.  Also the green curry was salty, i have a very salty palate, but even this was more than my liking.  But it was good though, good with rice that is.  Also even though we got it "mild" it still had a healthy kick of spices.  The Thai fried rice was also mediocre and a lil on the oily side.  The Tom Yum soup was good.  Again nothing special but atleast it didnt taste off.  Again this was a lil on the salty side too.  The only notable dish that we had was the Papaiya salad with salted crab.  That has a unique after taste.    So in review, if you were at MeKong Plaza and had a craving for Thai food, then lucky you.  But its not a place you'd actually actively seek out if you werent literally already there.    Pros: -happy hour specials daily 4 to 7:30Pm (supposedly) -great happy hour specials that are actually delish! - great decor hahahha  Cons: - food is sub par - thai specialties are sub par - thai tea wasnt a home run. - prices are not reflective of the quality and quantity.

Great little sushi joint thats tucked in shopping center.  There's plenty of sushi places around but this one is one step above the surrounding competition.  Its family owned and operated so service is warm (surprisingly for an asian family owned joint).  The great thing about it is the menus HAS PICTURES of the actual roll itself and a description.  My biggest pet peeve is not knowing what my sushi will look like.  Most sushi have ridiculous names and the description generally barely helps (THINK RA SUSHI).  I like the non-tradtional concoctions that House Sushi has made up.  2 things that i look for in sushi is portion and taste.  The portions are HUGE (unlike RA SUSHI) and deffinitely filling.  And second is the taste, i love it when my sushi has its own separate sauce to it.  not too much to drown it, and not too little to make it seem like just decoration.  But enough that you can taste, dip, whatever.  So kudos to that.  All in all good food at even better prices.  All their specialty rolls are UNDER $10!  HUGE ROLLS THAT ARE UNDER $10 is great.  Cant beat this place if you're in the area for great sushi.  PRO -Pictures on the menu -HUGE portions (1 fills me up) -great sauces -great sushi -CHEAAPPPPP PRICES -happy hour specials too!  Cons -small place -not big on drinks -the male waiter is a total hottie, so distracting to eat.  (hahahha)
