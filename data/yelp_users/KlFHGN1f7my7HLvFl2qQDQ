Food is spectacular. Best american food in this city hands down. Staff is exceptional, friendly, everyone knows your name. Wally... he's kind of a grouch. But whatever. I think he's just getting old... and tired of it all. The bar is adorable, the patio is so cozy and quaint, and the laughter makes this place a joy to be in. Great place.

Yummy, yummy, yummy. Very gormet, cute atmosphere. It's a little pricey though for pizza and soda though. So pricey that I would say a 3.5 star would be more appopriate, but based on the service, and the ambiance, and the flavors of the food they get 4.

It's hard giving someone a 5 star review becuase there is always something they can improve on... So, my only complaint is that you cannot call ahead and order food to go. Sooo annoying. You have to actually valet your car, sit at the bar, order and wait...by yourself, and chances are you will order a drink becuase you look weird if you don't. Probably bc the place is so packed that they don't want to be just a food joint... they want you to drink. They weed out the cheaper customers and get the more bang for their buck customers this way.   This place gets 5 stars for the patio, the staff, the bbq seasoned french fries, the burgers, the tacos, pretty much any dish... yummy, yummy, yummy. It's tasty American food with a rustic/modern ambiance. It's great for a date the fire places, twinkle lights, and the comfy seating make it a warm place to enjoy a good dinner with your family and friends.

Best sushi I have ever had, hands down. I thought I was going to be so dissapointed that they didn't serve alcohol, but nope! The food was so damn good that it doesnt even matter. Love the idea of BYOB, just have never tried it before. Huge servings, healthy, tasty, my favorite was the Las Vegas Roll. Holy hell. Amazing.

We really wanted to like this place... especially since we live less than .5 mile away... it was that same cold vibe when we were there. So sad. I don't get it, it looks like it would have so much potential. Too bad they went so modern with the design of it all. A patio dining experience to me is twinkle lights, hanging plants, cozy chairs, laughter, a friendly bar tender who likes their job, tells jokes, has a warm vibe... but no... none of this. Also, why do people decide to open places like this without great simple food? They should make friends with the owner of Wally's, and take a few notes. Good food+ laid back vibe= talk of the neighborhood. Not a difficult business model.   I'd like this place to add some fun tables out front, where you can sip on wine and enjoy the vibe of the hood, some nice outdoor music, hanging planters, a courtyard with grass instead of the 5 parking spots they have there...a doggie dish outside of it all with a menu that has the best wings in town, the best pasta dishes, a nice breakfast menue, and a neat coffee bar!

I'm not one to slam a service, especially if I haven't used it, unfortunately here's my experience. I called Insectek becuase of everyones' 5 star comments on Yelp. I was calling for a quote. I told the owner that I had brown dog ticks in the backyard and some in the house on the dog beds. He asked for my address (Arcadia) and the size of my home and lot. I told him 2400 sq. feet, and the lot I wasnt sure of but that it was around 3,500 sq. feet. He quoted me $700 for the size of my property for outside and inside treatment (visiting a total of 3 times in a 30 day period so every 7-10 days or so), then the bi-monthly service would be $68 every 2 months. It sounded expensive. He told me that it might even be more than that depending on how hard it would be to get to the ticks and the size of the property and conditions... I thought to myself hummm... that ounds odd. He said that they charge a normal price for how long they stay to do the work and treat tthat they would do my carpets as well. Not the entire carpets but the very edge up to the baseboards on all areas of each room as well as the corners and any crevices that may be on top of the baseboards they would spray in. It sounded very thourough. He offered to have Lucio come out to give me a firm quote 2 days before my appointment bc i ne. If you click on their website from the yelp add on the right hand side you will see that you get 50% off your initial treament... I asked the owner about that while I was on the phone and he said that has nothing to do with treating ticks and that its entirely different and a different process... so there went that discount. However, it doesn't say that on the website. Oh well, I set the actual extermination appointment for this Friday at 10:30 am, I arranged my father in law to watch the house while I take the kids out to the park and lunch waiting for the chemicals to dry. I told him that It was still good for me to know the firm quote though so we arranged for Lucio to be at my house at 12:30pm today (Wednesday). Mind you, I have called 3 other companies since my convo. with the owner of Insetek. They have all quoted anywhere from $200 to $300 for the extermination and $45 to $50/month after for upkeep. I was starting to get the vibe maybe I was over quoted but I didn't call to cancel my "firm quote" appointment with Lucio just yet. I wanted to see what Lucio had to say about why it was so much money upfront for coming 3 times the first month and higher on the monthly side, with no guaruntee if it didn't work... also maybe there was some magic potion they used on brown dog ticks that I had never heard of, so I wanted to give them a chance based on the reviews. He arrived, yes he's very nice, and friendly and calls you mam and shakes your hand is well dressed and wears booties... but the second I asked him about what chemicals he was going to be using it threw him for a loop. He was off his game. I told him that I just wanted to know the names of them and the gallons he was going to use on the size of my property and about how long it would take. He stumbled on his words, told me that the office could email me that kind of thing and that he would just walk the property and see. I also told him before he walked the property that I had gotten 3 quotes since my phone call with him and that they were sooo much less and I was just curious why. He asked me how much and I told him.. He hopped on the phone and called the owner while he was outside. He came back inside and said that he would charge $500 if I did the bi-monthly service for $68 a month and wanted to set an appointment. I told him that I already had an appointment for 10:30 am on Friday and that I would see him then after he could somehow get a list of chemicals that were to be used on my exact property and size.... He said, well I filled that spot since you needed a firm quote first so we need to reschedule and we need to do it tomorrow. He said he would provide a list of chemicals. I was not feeling too great about things becuase they just lowered the price randomly... at that point I had a feeling this wasnt the right place to do business. My gut was telling me that I should cancel by the end of business today and go with another company. What made things so obvious that this is a shady company is that Lucio stayed in his car in my front driveway for 10 min. talking on the phone, I was on my phone as well calling the other companies to see if they could give me an idea of what the exact names of the chemicals they use are called to see what they are called. Just then Lucio walked up to my door and rang the doorbell. I opened it up and he said, "The names of the chemicals are Temprid, Suspend, Bifred granuals.... but we don't usually do this. Will you be keeping the appointment or no?" Cancelled. Nice guy, bad business play. Expect the unexpected. Never expect a sale.

Yep, this is a perfect lunch dinner spot. Bright, friendly, healthy, neighborhood and family friendly, and the food was very flavorful. The menu was a little confusing at first but I always just ask what the most popular dishes are and go from there. I wish it was a little less expensive as I would go there a few days a week for luch, but I cannot justify spending over $9 or $10 on lunch, so it's a once in a while kind of lunch eatery.
