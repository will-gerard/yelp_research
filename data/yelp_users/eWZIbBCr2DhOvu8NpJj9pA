Been coming to see Lynnette for over a year for my color and cut...by far the best. She is terrific in her trade, and her personality is awesome! She is smart and professional and you will never leave here anything but pleased

Love this place. Fish and chips is awesome. Place is packed all of the time. I can't comment on the service because I have always ordered to go, but the food is awesome

To order take out is an unbelievable feat. First of all, the manager/owner or her son ( on the weekend) will answer the phone but can't or won't take the order, you have to wait while they try to grab a  busy server walking by.  Grandma then answers and writes your order tells you it will be ready in 10 to 15 minutes Upon arrival when you try to pay... Low and behold the cashier ( the same person that answered the phone) is unable to ring you up you have to wait for the person that took your order.after paying they walk over to a two top table where your food has been sitting waiting for you to pick it up...not under the heat lamp kept warm! It is crazy While the food is only ok, I have serious reservations...in addition you are charged .25 for having a take out meal and .25for each take out container you have

I called before going to see what the wait time would be and was told to come on down parts were in stock and he had time right now. I said I will be there shortly. I arrived ten minutes later and was greeted with "can I help you?" or something to the effect, which caught me off guard becasue I seen no one, I only heard someone as he was behind the really large monitor of the computer. I stated I was the person that called a few minutes ago about the 6+ screen repair ( my fiance owns a retail store location in which I handle all operations for and so I should have known better than to represent myself in that manner, but it happened anyways) to which I was asked if I had any idea how many people he talks to in a day and has no idea what I was talking about.! While I can respect that and understand his point, we have the same happen when people stop in our store and introduce themselves as the person  that called about the restaurant equipment...he could have rephrased that statement in more respectable, business professional manner, and although it initially pissed me off that is not what this review happens to be about..I am not reviewing the way they greet people when they arrive and I am not reviewing responses they make..This review is about the service/work I received when utilizing this Nextech Repair to repair my phone. I gave Nextech Repair five stars...this wasn't my first time here, it was my third time here. I originally found this place by accident a couple of years ago and received the same quality of service then as I did today...perfection! Every time I have utilized Nextech Repair to repair my screen  I have always received my phone completed and looking brand new within 20 minutes or less. I have never experienced any issue with the home button not working or the touch not working, or any other issue. These folks know what they are doing here, and they know how to do it fast and efficient. The amount of the repair is fair and reasonable and less than having it completed at the Apple store. I would have no qualms about recommending Nextech Repair for screen repair. They are good, they are fair and they are fast. I can even say they are friendly as the same person that at first pissed me off with his attitude engaged in a conversation with me while completing my repair as I was seated on his couch, that was friendly and enjoyable.  Should I find myself in need of a screen repair in the future, I will no doubt find myself here to have the repair completed.

Rudest person I have ever met,  was here the other night. Had an excuse for anything I tried to order, with an attitude to top.  If your unhappy with your position...by all means please find another position!  Your sassy and abrasive conduct first thing in the morning was needed or appreciated

I really enjoyed my experience here. From the initial phone call I knew I would have a good experience. Very relaxed environment, very clean as well. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. Missy did a wonderful job on my tattoo and was I couldn't be happier! I would definitely visit her again.
