This place is the best. My nail guy even gave me his cell phone number so I can text him when I'm coming in to make sure they have a spot for me. My acrylics are gorgeous and Jimmy always takes great care of me. I won't go anywhere else.

UPDATE: After going here for over two years, I am done. I tip well every single time and used to really love the service here. However, I think because I tip so generously, my quality of service decreased dramatically with time. When he does the top coat now, Jimmy barely puts on enough to give it a shine and my nails look like crap in a day. He is very talented and knows what he is doing, so either the salon is trying to save on expenses or he doesn't want a $10 tip for a fill. I'm mad, I've been a loyal customer here for so long and I've been paying for junk. I got my nails done while visiting family on the other side of the US and that reminded me what it's supposed to look like when someone does a thorough top coat. When jimmy did my nails they would start lifting within a week. It's now two whole weeks since I got a fill from another salon and they still look amazing. Don't go here. They don't care for good customers.

I am so grateful for Four Legged Friends. We brought in our four month old boxer the morning after we took her to an emergency clinic and received a diagnosis of parvovirus. The contrast between the care at those two veterinary hospitals only emphasized how great Four Legged Friends is. Because of the dangerous and contagious virus she was diagnosed with, 4LF asked we call when we arrived so they could clear the lobby. They used bleach behind us and had a bleach tub for us to wipe our shoes on to prevent spreading the virus. Both the vet tech and the vet were warm, caring, attentive, patient and loving. We were sent home with a comprehensive knowledge of what we needed to do to give our girl the best chance at a complete recovery and all the tools we needed. 4LF has called every day to check on her. I'm so grateful and happy to say our boxer is thriving and while we have a long road ahead I'm really grateful for the great care they took and I think she's going to be okay.

Clearly, they're doing something right, because I was back within a week. This time got a Great White with mushrooms. Of note, the white pie (duh) doesn't have the red sauce of which I was so fond, so I got to experience a whole different side of Fatso's. I just have to say, I'm hooked. This place has a completely unique taste and I love it. Strongly recommend the Great White. I'm craving it now, but I'm going to be the size of a house if I eat here as often as I want to.

Awesome food and friendly staff. The restaurant is a little small so it's great for takeaway.

This is definitely "my store". I'm here almost every other day. There are several sales associates that I have gotten to know and make polite conversation with; it's nice to have such friendly people but then I don't want to run in when I look like crap, which is probably a good thing for everybody. I love Fry's because the prices are closer to Walmart than Safeway, but the self checkout gets me out of there quickly (as opposed to Safeway- doesn't have one) and the store is large and has most things I need without being a day trip just to reach all four corners (like Walmart). I'll miss this Fry's when I move!

I just used these guys for my move yesterday, and I can't say enough how happy I am with the service we got. I almost chose 2 Men and a Truck again, as I used that company last time, but the reviews for Camelback Movers were so good I felt safe trying them out and wanted to see what everyone is raving about. Now I know.   First off, before my move, customer service took a thorough inventory over the phone. They explained different insurance coverages available and helped me estimate how long the move would take. I was able to pick the time of day that worked best for me and got a special rate thanks to a promotion / an off-peak moving day. Be advised there is a trip fee, which some competitors don't have, but please believe me when I tell you Camelback Movers is worth it.   The movers 1. Called about half an hour before arrival and 2. Were on time to the minute. I had a two man crew and they were both friendly, personable, funny and absolute work horses. They provided us with wardrobe boxes we filled while they were taking apart my L-shaped sectional- which, by the way, they "fixed". It's a power recliner at either end of the L and one of them was stuck in the up position for over a year now. Turned out it was faulty wiring in the power source and using a different power source they were able to put down the recliner. Awesome. They wrapped said leather recliner in thick furniture pads and then shrink wrapped it before moving it, the same with our (heavy) wooden kitchen table with lazy Susan, and my bed's leather headboard. One of them (I'm sorry I forgot your names guys) remarked "We're gonna keep it pretty!"  None of my furniture was damaged and no boxes were handled roughly. The move ended up taking about what we had estimated at the beginning and I was more than happy with the price. My boyfriend was very pleased as well and thought it was so kind that when they left, one of the men told him "it would be an honor to be pulled over by you". It was nice to have movers that didn't mind we are law enforcement.   Lastly, while moving, I somehow managed to get a complete tear in my ACL. It started as a minor work injury and steadily got worse until it just ripped and I buckled. It happened at the new residence and I was fighting off tears as my boyfriend helped me walk to the car to go to the hospital. The movers saw what kind of pain I was in and advised my boyfriend they were going to work as hard and fast as possible so that he could come be with me, and I really really appreciate that. I was in a LOT of pain and I was pretty embarrassed. They finished up in 7 minutes.   I'm now laid up in the beautiful new house with a full leg brace, all my furniture is set up beautifully and looks fantastic from the move, all the boxes are where they need to be. I'm really happy with the service we got and if we had the money I would want to re-hire our crew to come UNpack for me while I lay here. Lol! Thank you Camelback Movers, if we move again in 2 years we're hiring you again no question.

Our server Cassy has been super attentive and accommodating! We asked for an appetizer that contains bacon to just put the bacon on one side (I'm vegetarian; he is definitely not) and she said no problem and they would have the chef cook the halves separately! How nice :-) We are having a great time, will definitely come back!

Always love coming here. A trip here always boosts my mood! Costco treats their employees well and as a result we get great service, across the board, every single time. Not to mention smokin' deals!   I'm sad to say I'm moving presently and will soon have a different Costco. I hope they measure up because from pharmacy to butchers to front staff to greeters/checkers, everyone here is sweet and friendly. I wish everyone at this store the very best. Thank you for your exemplary service.

I really can't complain. Here's my story: I swerved and narrowly avoided a full on head-on collision by a wrong-way drunk driver on the SR51 on January 16th, and my personal car was screwed. My front drivers side panel is ruined and my drivers side mirror was 400% GONE. Thankfully I'm fine and I'm glad I had good reflexes, or a guardian angel, or something. So once I stopped crying and had called work and 911 and the insurance company, at 2300 hours, I was tired and upset and felt like my insurance after hours adjuster was trying to get me to admit the whole thing WAS my fault, after all. I wasn't so sure how well my exigent circumstance would be taken care of. My cynicism was unfounded.  My insurance set me up with Enterprise. I called and spoke to a nice guy named Ian who promised he would have a car ready for me when I arrived the next morning (I work nights). I advised I would be there early. He said, no problem. So after work, boyfriend and child in tow, I arrived at opening time on the nose.   Checked in with Ian, small talk about my job, etc. He stated he remembered our conversation and my vehicle was ready. Now mind you I had had a rough week... I looked out front and saw a sneaker-white Versa waiting... My exact words were, "Bro, please don't make me leave here in a Versa. Bro..."  Half an hour later - yes I was initially grumpy about the wait time (I had no right) - I was driving away in a gorgeous Dodge Journey which is perfect for my family and work commute, and the best thing I could think of to drive for a month while I wait for my car to be repaired.   The staff was friendly and cared about the customers concerns. Ian listened to my wants and found a way to make it work, and quickly. Out of such a small service center, that's definitely commendable. And the vehicle has been excellent- very low mileage, evidently excellent maintenance, clean as a whistle and just an overall pleasure. Thank you guys keep it up. I'll return your Journey when my insurance makes me ;) Haha. End of the week. See you then.

Very pleased with our service. Good communication prior to him coming out resulted in having the part for my washer ready for the repair, and his price was fair. So happy we have a 1-year warranty on the part/repair and he was able to come out so quickly. Excellent service and we wouldn't hesitate to use this company again.

Absolutely delicious dinner. I didn't mind much because I love getting out for a while and people watching, but even with a reservation the wait was significantly longer than expected. Reservation for nine, weren't sat until close to 9:45. This was fine for us but would have been a headache if we'd had our young son with us instead of with a sitter. The customer service was amazing, and we could see the team running around like chickens with their heads cut off, doing everything they could to please everybody. Management ought to provide more staff for such a busy location.

Dear Burger King, I have given you a try 3 separate times now, over the course of several months, because you are on my way home from work and sometimes I am hungry and make poor choices. I'm really not trying to be rude here, but after a seriously messed up order on all 3 occasions I am afraid we have to call it quits. Order 1: 2 BK Veggie burgers with cheese. What I got? 2 BK Fish. Let's try again. Order 2: 2 BK Veggie burgers with cheese. What I got? 1 BK Veggie, no cheese, 1 BK fish. Let's do this one more time. Order 3: 2 BK Veggie burgers with cheese. What I got? 2 cheeseburgers. I'm so over you.

Rob, the owner, was fantastic and made time in his schedule to clean our carpets for a last-minute move out. I then had to reschedule on him due to landing myself in the ER... We left him a key and left the money in the oven. Lol. We were nervous about the results because our carpets had such wonderful features, to include pet stains, wine stains, koolaid stains, and more! And truthfully our apartment looks better and smells better NOW than it did when we moved in. He really does clean all the way down through to the carpet padding. Not much else to say, but that this guy has integrity, and he delivers what he promises. We are going to hire him to clean the carpets in our new rental home. Anyone reading, I recommend him over Stanley Steemer; Rob actually cares about his end result. Give him all your business Yelpers!!!

After reading positive reviews on Yelp I was eager to check them out. However when I called in to discuss my appliance the woman on the phone cut me off and informed me they won't discuss appliance issues on the phone, that I need to pay to have a tech come out and it's $55 for said visit which will be waived if I use this company. She impatiently waited for me to give her my address. That's gonna be a "No"... I had run a diagnostic on my washer, as I attempted to explain, and after researching my model I was reasonably sure I knew what part needed to be replaced. I was hoping I could discuss this with them on the phone prior to a visit to ensure they had the part with them when they came. "No," she told me, "that's not how it works. They will come out and see what parts they need to get, what is your address?" So I'll need two trips to fix my washer? Because she wouldn't even listen to what type of appliance needed repair, much less a model number! No thank you! I went with Wright's appliance repair instead and am so glad I did. Check out my review there.

Breakfast at this place is straight up amazing. I've taken multiple friends and coworkers, as well as my parents when they visited, and everybody has loved it. My go-to is the five egg whites scramble or the French toast.

Can't speak highly enough of this place. I was a new patient, UTTERLY MISERABLE, with strep throat that had gone undiagnosed and untreated since Tuesday (it's now Friday). Probably a bit of a mess and I cried talking to the doctor because I feel so miserable and was so frustrated with the "care" I received at Cigna. Staff here was empathetic and helped me be seen quickly, sent my scripts over to my pharmacy of choice before I even left, and were friendly, caring and understanding. Less than an hour after I left my house I'm back home with my prescriptions and so relieved I saw a doctor who would listen to me. I will never go to another clinic/Urgent Care again. This place is it!!! Thank you so much!!!!

Updated review: I had to go AGAIN today - I can't seem to stop getting sick this winter. Despite a full waiting room and approaching closing time, everybody was very friendly and helpful, and I was in and out in an hour. Just like before, the providers were friendly and kind, listened to my concerns and I feel did a very good job. I can't stress enough how nice it is to have a fast, easy, friendly place when you don't feel well. So glad this place exists!

Updated review. I waited two months for the balance to be deducted from my checking account, as I left my card info and authorization with the office for them to use once my insurance notified them of the balance. The balance just so happened to be withdrawn at the worst possible time (that's how it goes, isn't it?) after several unexpected expenses related to moving. I called the FastMed front desk to relay my story and ask if I could possibly have the funds returned, and then pay my balance after the next pay period. The front desk person assured me that the people in billing should be able to work something out and I was instantly relieved. She transferred me over to Billing and the female I spoke with was disdainful, snippy, dismissive, and rude. She told me there's "probably nothing we can do, once you pay us, that's it" but agree to let me speak with her supervisor. I was sent to the voicemail of a Ms. Castaneda, ostensibly the supervisor. I left a voicemail containing all pertinent info, acknowledging that I was asking a lot but made a point to explain the urgency (to whit: the $107 in question would allow me to pay my rent on time). I left my contact info and waited for a callback. The rude lady had said Ms. Castaneda was in a meeting and would "probably call you back. Soon." Guess what? Never called me back, not that day, not the next day, and now its a month later and no call. It's a shame because on the front end the staff here is phenomenal, but the billing department treated me like a second class citizen, less than garbage and then completely ignored me. You've lost my business and I'll let all my coworkers at the County (who provides my health insurance!) know not to go here. Very unprofessional and I am extremely disappointed and angry.

We love coming here. Portions are definitely large, so come in hungry! I always get Eggs Benedict with avocado and it's a fantastic, filling, delicious brunch. Staff is always pretty quick with service and beverage refills, despite how busy they usually are, so props to them!

This review concerns the urgent care and specifically Dr. McShane (or something along those lines). Went in Wednesday sick as a dog. He treated me like a drug seeker (I would know, I worked in a pharmacy for some time), didn't listen to my symptoms and now three days later I'm significantly worse. Called the office and broke down crying out of frustration and pain and he begrudgingly agreed to give me a Z Pack when I just told him- in broken sentences- that I can't swallow. How I'm going to take it I have no idea. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE. He's going to tell you to drink lots of water and get lots of rest, meantime your infection will get worse and you'll feel like me.

A service that lets you shop locally and delivers your items to your house within the hour for a nominal fee. What's not to love?! At first blush, PikFly sounds too good to be true. Their website boasts an impressive catalogue of just about anything you could want, and the prices- get this- aren't inflated at all! There has never been an excuse to get a DUI, but with this service there's just no reason to leave the party to re-up supply. I was particularly impressed with the safety measures they have in place; PikFly texted me a link to a picture of my "Navigator" (delivery guy) with his ETA. My navigator also arrived with a prominently displayed ID badge. He also called to let me know when he arrived. All in all 5 stars- I was impressed with the pricing, loved the great service, was impressed by the safety measures and just wish I'd known about PikFly sooner.

Prices beat out everyone else, sketchy pawn shops included. Moreover the staff is so knowledgable and meets you where you are to teach you what you need to know without being condescending. It means a lot that they prioritize education and responsible handling over making a quick buck. Made my first of what will be many purchases from them yesterday and I guarantee I will be back for classes and further purchases. Also, they offer to order in accessories they don't have in stock with no shipping costs. Bitchin'. Shout out to Carol, girl you're awesome!
