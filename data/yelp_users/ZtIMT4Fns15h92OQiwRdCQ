Dr. Mary Deka is an amazing gynecologist! She makes you feel comfortable and at ease. I always look forward to seeing her. I am sure that sounds strange when one is talking about their gyno. :-)   The office is extremely clean, welcoming and modern. The staff at PV OBGYN are amazing as well! Dr. Deka's nurse, Grey, is wonderful.    If you need an annual, or are looking for an amazing DR to deliver your baby, Dr. Deka is your girl! I would sincerely recommend her to anyone!

We recommend Dr. Amols and the staff at AZ Assoc for Reproductive Health! We ended up needing an emergency ultrasound on our way out of town over the holidays and they were so kind to squeeze us in (where many others couldn't, since it was so last minute.) They provided us with the necessary information we needed with our diagnosis! They also provided us with important phone numbers in case we needed to contact the DR in the event of an emergency - which made us feel so comforted!   Karen, the office manager is also amazing! She is going far out of her way to help us with insurance benefits. I am sure many know how rediculous it can be to work with insurance for infertility...and Karen has been SO helpful to assist us with billing and other insurance issues.  They have a great team and would recommend them!!

I recently visited Focal Point had Kaylee cut & color my hair and she is so talented!! The salon is super cute and the stylists all seem amazing. The front desk staff is also superior to most salons I have visited. Very helpful! I would highly recommend Kaylee!!

This place had potential too! Bummer. The decor is lovely, but the service is AWFUL. We ordered dinner and drinks...WE ended up having to go up to the bar ourselves to get the drinks after waiting 15 minutes. Our food took over 30 minutes to come out, and my bruschetta came out totally wrong. They have a pick 3...and the server brought out 1 out of the 3 I ordered. My husband ordered a burger and it was just ok.  I wish they would have executed the service, because it really is a cute place. Definitely will not be returning to Modern Grove.
