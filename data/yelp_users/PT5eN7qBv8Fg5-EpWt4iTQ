Great place to bring family on a Saturday or Sunday.  Lots of shade with picnic tables for you to enjoy the beautiful scenery while eating a good sandwich with organic ingredients.  At the end of the farm you will find the morning glory cafe that offers a great brunch.  Price is medium/high for breakfast but it's worth it.  Once you are all set and done you will spend about $20 per person with tip.  Worth the trip.  People that work there are great too.  I almost forgot to tell you to bring your camera and you best smile as there is a lot of cool spots to take pictures.  If you have kids bring them over and let them run wild in the nice grassy areas and let them check out the chickens and ducks.

Great Mexican food.   Been here before and the quality of food is great specially the hand made tortillas you get with your molcajete. Would have given them 5 stars if my water stayed full all the time and the wait to check out was shorter.

Their customer service is what would bring me back to this facility. Guy at counter was nice, fast, efficient and made my experience a breeze. If you need a moving truck, go to u haul.com make your reservation and pick up at this location. Won't be disappointed.   Guy at counter- keep up the good work.

Fantastic Cuban food at great prices. The exquisite sandwich I had(sandwich de bistec) had great flavor and looked awesome. Note: many of the dishes have a lot of onion so be careful if you don't like onion just like my wife.  My beautiful wife had the classic Cuban sandwich which was really good, however it was huge.  See picture compared to my wife's head.  Got to try this place.  I'm given it 4 stars because my wife said the pastries she tasted had too much egg taste. I thought it was great. Overall and definitely recommend it.   Service was great too and loved the authenticity of the people that work there

Awesome place to have a nice dinner. Decided to check it out on a Sunday evening after church with my brother Jairo and his beautiful family. The place is beautiful so please bring your camera.  Service was great too with very friendly and attentive staff.  Ordered appetizers from the happy hour menu which were fairly priced. AppetiZers were surprisingly awesome. Menu offers good American selection at decent prizes.  Kids options are fantastic and definitely priced correctly.  Not the most affordable on the main courses but is worth it as food was good and the view was all worth it.  Will definitely be back. I would have given it 5 stars if they didn't charge for refills on fountain drinks and if they didn't charge me an extra $4 to split a meal with my wife.

I expect better from chipotle. There was six people in my party and we were all excited to eat here as we where coming from rocky point and decided not to eat in anywhere in between.   We got in line asked for green salsa and guess what???? NO GREEN SALSA!!!  Seriously???    Steak??? 4 min wait which I can understand as it happens but then I they forgot my nephews quesadilla.    We then go to the drink station and the water dispenser is loose, NO NAPKINS and then no kids for my drinks, I then go sit down and I have to clean my own table . Come on chipotle. Here is my assessment of this store.   Restaurant definitely seems understaffed and the only staff that is available is more worried about the back end. Get your act together. I'll be back again on Sunday and give this location a second chance.

So here is the deal. In the phoenix area you will find plenty Mexican food however this one is different.  Here is why. Most the Mexican food you find in Phx has a northern Mexico/Sonoran influence which is good but it is different than central Mexico.  This is one of the best authentic central Mexico restaurant. If you don't believe me just try the Mexican enchiladas with chicken and green sauce.  Don't forget to ask for avocado.  You will not be disappointed.  Your welcome!

Ok so I was hesitant to take my truck to these guys but I decided to give them an opportunity regardless of other reviews and because they had a great deal on an oil Change. You can't beat a synthetic valvoline oil change for under $20. Showed up at 8am dropped off my truck to ED and a couple of hours later called me to tell it was ready.   What else can you ask for. I really recommend them. I also found out they are under new management so give them a shot.

great pizza and fantastic pasta.  They are very nice people and attentive.  At first I was confused because I thought there was waiters but it turns out you order at counter first and then they bring you the food... definitely will be back soon.

Want to try a really good torta(Mexican sandwich?  This is one of the best places in Phoenix.  It's in a rough part of town but don't worry I'm positive you will like it.  Place is always clean and their menu is awesome. You can also try the ribeye tacos as they are also pretty awesome. On the way out don't forget to pick up some Mexican sweet bread or an ice cream cone.   I would have given them 5 stars but I believe their food is expensive. They should have at least a 1 special of the day.  Expect to spend between 9 and 11 dollars for lunch.

Tacos a fantastic. Specially the Al Pastor.  If you want authentic Tijuana tacos without  the TJ thrill, this is the place to go.    Place is very clean and all employees are very friendly.

Great little Mexican restaurant with an authentic taste in the food.   Kids soup is a traditional Mexican soup that every kid likes and the adult meals where really good too. We had enchiladas with a pork chop on the side and a huarache.  The pork chop was perfectly cooked and had a great taste. Everything else was also good. Spicy enough to to enjoy comfortably.

Love it. My goal is to try every dish on the menu.  So far everything is amazing.  Try it, you will not be disappointed.   Be sure to end your meal with a Mango and sticky rice. It's awesome.   There is only 10 tables but their service fantastic and fast.   Did I mention that they always make my daughter her own soup?  We'll she loves it too.

Favorite international Asian spot.  This place is so authentic, and amazing you will not be disappointed. It had been a while since the last time we where here as we moved but every time we come back is just as amazing. Love the owners as they always take care of us and always give a little gift to my daughter.  If you have kids they will be more than happy to make you a kitchen broth soup. The Tom yum kah is my favorite with extra chicken.  Don't forget dessert(mango and sticky rice is amazing.

Another fantastic international spot.  First time trying the PHO and I liked it.  The stir fry's are my favorite. My wife got #35 which comes with shrimp, beef and chicken and it was delicious.  I got the spicy noodles which already comes with the spices and its was pretty good.  Service is awesome and they are pretty quick.  I didn't realize they also sell steak which I will definitely have to try them next time.  Workers are very nice and helpful if needed. Will definitely be back.   I would give it 5 stars if the bathroom was a little cleaner.

So I ordered frozen strawberry and real strawberries snacks along with pepehuates for my mom.  After I specially pointed to the size I wanted and was very clear with what I wanted they still gave me the wrong order.  After I mentioned it to him he said he charged me incorrectly and I had to pay the difference to get what I originally asked for.  Instead of apologizing he decided to charge me more.  Never coming back here again.  Please please get some customer service classes.

Awesome service and professional barbers that are service minded.  Haircut for the whole family.  Eli is the owner and he is a down to earth guy that is always in a good mood and offers great consistent service.    Call ahead if you like but not necessary.   All barbers are super awesome and professional.  Definitely recommend this place.  Check out the pictures

Wow. What a beautiful jack in the box.  Pulled up thru the drive thru and order taker was very nice and helpful. I was expecting people in training but totally not the case. I immediately noticed the big window that allows you to see inside the restaurant prep area from the drive thru. It really makes me feel good to know nothing shady is happening with my food.  The interior looked great and had a modern feel to it however I didn't get a chance to go inside as I was in a hurry and I just wanted something to drink. I hope they maintain this place clean and in shape as new. We definitely don't need another crappy fast food place.
