I had a decent time here the other night while visiting Scottsdale... It was a Thursday, 2 for 1 drinks til midnight, but I thank my good time to the company I was in and the lovely people watching the crowd here provided.   Let's start with problem numero uno- The place is located in a Safeway shopping center... no joke! So get your groceries and come shake your booty all in one trip ;) Now I know Scottsdale has a rep, and to be honest, I do enjoy surrounding myself in that scene once in a while but seriously could not get over the fact that while sitting on their "posh" patio, I was watching the cart boy rounding up stray shopping carts. Location location location, this place fails miserably at that.   The drinks were okay... call me crazy but I actually prefer to taste some alcohol in my martini.   And the decor in the place was a joke! You walk in to a big open room... think Rocky Pointe spring break style back in HS when you went to those 20$ all you can drink parties. All that was missing was the video crew recording the raunchy females, cougars in this case. The chairs/seating in the car were cheap looking and overall reminded me of Ikea.  On the plus side, it was pretty busy but chill enough were my friends and I could enjoy each others company without being knocked into by others.  For wanting a chill night with great people watching this place is great. But please get over your posh sophisticated attitude because you are far from it and the place would actually have more potential if you realized it. My favorite part of the night... A cougar with a much older sugar daddy. She walks away from daddy to be swept away my 20someyhing boy toy, only to turn around, and hang her purse on daddy before heading to the dance floor to grind on the boy. Poor daddy was left outside, purse and all, looking like a fool. Made for decent people watching. I sadly left and don't know the outcome of this.... If you were there last night and saw these scene please do tell :)

A fabulous job done. My car was sparkling clean, no residue of my highway travels from California noticed anywhere on my vehicle.  *I got the Basic* Plus it was fairly quick process from start to finish.  Only downside... pricier than most places UNLESS you get the $4 Drive-Thru (that is a great deal).  Love the shaded seated waiting area, would be perfect for the hot AZ summer. The grounds are very clean and the cashier has some interesting little trinkets to look at while waiting.

Let me start out my saying this is my type of bar/club...  from the live alternative bands that perform here (usually good!) to the music played, this venue has a lot to offer... multiple bars, live music, bottle service, dance floor, and an outside area. Come here with a fun group and it's guaranteed a good time.

A city dedicated to luxury- Scottsdale really does have it all...   fabulous shopping, great dining, resorts & spas for golfing & pampering, and of course a great nightlife.   The city is pristine with gorgeous views of desert life.   Although the people of can come off a bit superficial, it's all what makes Scottsdale alluring and give it it's appeal.

The vibe exuding from this place is pure awesomeness. Reminiscent of a trendy hipster coffee joint, this is actually a casual vegan restaurant.   I am a pescatarian and unless I am eating seafood, I steer clear of meat, even the mock kind usually however once in a while it's delicious... so why try it here at Green I thought. The menu's style is comfort food, which as we all know traditionally is heavy on the meat, sauces, and fat content... so at least if you're going to be bad, you can do it with organic and pure ingredients.   So as I wanted to sample as much of the menu as possible, my lovely friend, her fiance, and I shared a few items:  *Artichoke Gratine: The corn chips were amazing, lightly salted and crisp. The dip was a bit too garlicky and runny for my liking. Ate a few bites of this but could not see myself eating the entire thing solo.  *Spicy Buffalo "Wings": first things first... do not let looks dismay you... true it looks gross but they taste legit! The flavor of the buffalo sauce was perfect, although could have been spicier. And the cucumber ranch dipping sauce was perfectly creamy and lightly flavored as to not overpower the "wings". This dish is a must try!!  *Vegan Chili Fries: the fries are thin cut and tasty. The chili sauce was good, at first, but I quickly got sick of the flavor. This could be because I was never a huge chili fan even back when I ate meat. Hmm, I think you are better off ordering the thyme fries.  *Crab Puffs: Perfectly crisp with a delicious creamy filling. Another must try!  Lastly my friend's fiance ordered that day's special which was a green chili burrito... delicious and huge. A bit too much rice but besides that a great option. It came with a side, which he ordered the curry pasta salad, mmm.   Green serves bowls, sandwiches, pizzas, salads... next time I am back in the area I will be checking out more of the menu when craving "meat" and not my usual tofu, seafood, veggie diet.    Might I add the service is friendly. Perfect place for a casual friend date.

I love the "Parisian sidewalks" which let you stroll around to the shops and restaurants inside this casino hotel. I love the decor of this place. The location is centrally located on the strip... a prime location with decent prices. The casino itself hosts an average crowd of gamblers... from the old to the young. The rooms are a bit on the boring side, but then again who spends much time in their room while in Vegas?! I certainly do not! The restaurants are delicious, from the buffet to the crepe place and various other restaurants, and lets not forget the one up in the Eiffel Tower. The service is friendly throughout the casino/hotel. Only downside is there is not a decent club inside this hotel... good thing it's in a great location and other clubs are close-by.

There are plenty of hotel/resorts to stay at on the Las Vegas Strip... Monte Carlo is in the top running for one of the best places to stay on the CHEAP.  The rooms are normal, slightly dated. Nothing fancy yet you also don't feel like you're at a cheap motel.   One of the best parts of this hotel is the pool area. Various pools, spas, and a lazy river! Plus, you don't have to wait ridiculous lines or have a promoter get you in. It's a low key yet still a fun pool... perfect to spend a hot Vegas day.  Perks Pool area Free WiFi Normal rooms   Overall, if you are in need of a place on the strip to stay for minimal $, Monte Carlo will not disappoint.

Clubs may come and go however Tao has established itself in the Vegas nightlife industry, and for very good reason.  Like anywhere worthy, the more you have to play with, the better your experience will be.  The gorgeous ladies in the bathtubs covered with rose petals and being displayed as art throughout is an appealing visual to both sexes... we all appreciate the human body.  The music is a great mix of everything... Perfect since it'll appeal to every type of person in your company.   Vegas pricing on cocktails and table service (which is honestly the only way to do Vegas).   An FYI to those traveling in mixed company- eat at the restaurant (yummy) and get into the club free although once again must stress that table service is a must to truly have the "Vegas experience".

So there I was in Phoenix on a sunny Saturday afternoon. I had just met with an old friend for a much too quick lunch before she had to go on a field trip. Guess they still do those in college, who knew?! We parted ways when I received a call from her that it was open to anyone and we could continue catching up... sure I said, as I love exploring random interests.  I board the bus with my friend and a group of Sustainability degree seeking students. We soon find ourselves in Glendale, AZ in a very normal neighborhood in front of a very normal, clean, green landscaped house... nothing screamed farm at me and the only reason I knew we were in the correct place (besides the fact the bus stopped here) was a tent which said Urban Farm on the side.  He was very into himself and the conversation was more Q and A style than anything else. Great as it involves the crowd however I felt more educational topics could have been covered. It felt at times as though he were speaking down to a group of second graders instead of the college students and adults in front of him.  Diverse plants and trees were explored as were different ways to cultivate.  Also loved the chickens.   An interesting time for those interested in the not so average.

Impromptu 24-hour trip with a guy I had just met in San Diego to meet up with about 10 of his closest friends? Sure why not?! It is Vegas after all... why not be spontaneous. (Long story short, we were in a relationship for a year, so sometimes it is worth it to take a spontaneous chance). Anyways, onto the real reason you are reading this review... what I thought of PH.  Three of us arrive in the evening on a Saturday. The rest of the group who arrived the morning before are all passed out. We wander around the hotel, nothing too exciting or boring, just average... lots of shops and of course the casino. It appeared the crowd as this place was mostly those in their twenties/thirties, a plus! We grab some liquor and head upstairs to start pre-gaming and getting ready. The rooms were clean and simple with a modern vibe going on. The bathroom was big... as four girls were able to get ready without much problem. The view was spectacular, we were able to see much of the strip.   So we drink, we party, and drink some more. Decide on staying in the hotel for the night so we wander around and find ourselves inside the mess that is the "line" to get into Prive. It was a madhouse. The guys begin to get annoyed but we calm them down as we know it will be like this anywhere considering we didn't head out til about 12am. So we work our girly magic and in we are! Inside is a typical club scene: plenty of dance floors and VIP seating areas. Danced the night away til about 4 am.   Next day we spent time at the pool. A few nice large pools with plenty of lounge chairs everywhere. This is no Intervention pool party but still a fun time. Then it was off to explore the strip before headed back home to the real world after a fantastic whirlwind 24 hour trip.

My first thought upon entering Chompie's, "what a neat little restaurant". It's a sit down restaurant, diner style. It's a bakery. It's a deli. All in one.  Right after being seated we were served our drinks and a plate of pickles and cucumber pickles (yes, I know all pickles are cucumbers but these were halfway between still being a cucumber and a full blown pickle). Odd but a delicious and surprising appetizer.  The menu is expansive... I was overwhelmed. I was originally craving a sandwich yet after quickly scanning the menu I noticed there was not a single veggie option. Sad, I moved on and quickly found 3-4 other entrees to decide between.  I finally settled on ordering the Israeli Couscous Fitness Salad *see picture*. It was HUGE and delicious. The lemon infused olive oil dressing was perfection. And I love that it came with a bialy as I badly wanted to try one here. If you are curious it's like bagel only not... it's a yeasty soft centered, crusty on the outside roll. A staple in Jewish and Polish dining. My friend ordered the Fitness Omelet which came with choice of healthy side and a bagel or bialy of your choice. She and I both enjoyed our meals and finished each bite.   Being a NY style Jewish Deli, I knew not to expect too many vegetarian choices,... there are however a few options, they accommodate special requests, and there is the daily soup which is vegetarian chili.  I was also impressed at the Polish-esque  entrees, I did not try since nothing compares to my grandma's cooking in that department.  Service was friendly and attentive even though the place was quite busy. As a UofA alumni, I could have done without every single server wearing ASU gear but I was in their territory after all.

Giddy up boys and girls!  This is a fun, casual evening spot to grab drinks (& food) with your friends. From hanging out at the bar, the spacious patio with stone fire pit, or at any of the oversized wooden tables... you will recieve prompt and friendly service.  Drinks are well poured. Had a few too many drinks and want to ride the bull? It makes for great entertainment for those like me who love people watching anyways.  This place is definitely a 'high energy, rock-western experience'.  *please note, this is a review of Saddle Ranch as a spot to hang out, the food has not been tested by yours truley*

The Jersey Shore called... they want their guidos/guidettes back.  Kidding, but in all honesty, being surrounded by Affliction, Ed Hardy, and getting someone else's tan (obviously the spray kind) rubbed off on you only means one thing... the 30K's that frequent here really wish they were on that MTV show.  I suppose I cannot blame Cream for the crowd that chooses to frequent here. The "lounge" itself is a very TINY space.... you can barely move around and forget about avoiding a creeper in there... no where to run except for maybe the ladies room. The music, decent yet LOUD! Turn it down a couple decibels as I couldn't even make out what my friend standing right in front of my face was screaming at me. Lastly, isn't a lounge supposed to have seating to in fact be classified as a lounge?! Because although Cream is about as big as a dorm room, having one couch in the "VIP" area really does not count.  On to tha next...

I am officially the owner of a fabulous pair of cowboy (cowgirl, to be exact) boots thanks to this store.  Located in Old Town Scottsdale, this is one of two Saba's locations only a mere block apart from one another. Despite the name and merchandise, they could not be more different in service, with this location exuding friendliness and smiles from the get go.  I tried on pair after pair after pair... and the sweet older man helping me was so patient and helpful. From answering all my questions to giving me some advice on different boots and styles. I walked out confident and content with the pair I chose. My wallet however was not as happy but a girl needs a good pair of cowboy boots so it was totally worth it!
