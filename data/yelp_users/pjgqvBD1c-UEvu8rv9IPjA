I Love Carolina's ! Great Mexican food!  Yummy all the way. Thanks to the power of Yelp, I did this place instead of some chain restaurant near downtown. I was kinda nervous in the ghetto neighborhood it was it but well worth it.   What a great discovery. Its hard to get all the basics exactly right but  Carolina's has delicious beans, rice, tortillas, and the Carne asada tacos are bomb!!. The service was quick and very pleasant. It's a counter order service and then they call out your name like a Starbucks but its yummy Mexican food.   Its fast enough for lunch if you work downtown and have a 30 min lunch break. Call it in and have a coworker pick it up. 602-252-1503  10/15/2012 update: I went to an event one of our customers had, and it was catered by Carolina's. I diden't know they did that. It was awesome!

When I first saw reviews on the airport, I was like "not like there is a choice what a silly thing to review" but upon pondering it for a quick moment, I'd have to say PHX Sky Harbor is a pretty good airport. Plenty of parking, pretty clean, not way out of town like alot of airports are, and free wi-fi too. In comparison to other airports I have been too over the years, PHX Sky Harbor has consistently been pretty good!

Great food and service. Not stuffy or "fancy". The ginger salad dressing is killer. A very pleasant surprise in a busted-down strip mall. You will not be disappointed.

The food is "bar food" however, it is done very well. Chicken wings, sandwiches,  fries, burgers, etc. This is a bit of a dive bar but its cool none the less

This place is good. Worth checking out if you are on that side of town. It's in the ghetto, but most good places are

some how this place is a "shell" station, Its really a bodega/smoke shop that happens to sell gasoline. stay away unless you are out of gas or jonesing for some strawberry e-juice for your killer vape rig.

Went back, seems to suck even more than before. Only went there because I had to, not much in this area if you need gas

This place is a classic, it used to be one of my regular places, good food, decent service, been around a long time, good vibe here. I sent in last month and they had new menus - they at least DOUBLED the prices on the menu. 20.00 bucks for a taco plate, no thanks! one of the nice things about mexican food is that it is affordable. Not here!  this place just lost my long term business.

Scam, inflated prices, work not done on time. Good shops are hard to find, and if you want a good mechanic, keep looking, don't go here.  Mike and the crew DO bullsh*t you! this place is dishonest! 300 bucks and 2 days for a part that is 50.00 and available in-stock at every auto-zone in the valley. And that is just the part, add another 300 for "labor".  So, the work was not done on time and I was WAY overcharged. Some overcharging is OK and expected, but this is ridiculous.  Have to hand it to them, these people are good actors.  UPDATE: I was just doing some service on the car, and I discovered that nothing was ever replaced, so Granite Reef Service Center is a total scam. If this was discovered more recently, I'd call the police on these CRIMINALS. They charged me for work not done, and parts not installed.

This is the best ihop in the valley. So go there because they have great service and everyone is nice. The food is really good. My favorite food is the pancakes. They are the best, so next time you go try the whole wheat pancakes. This is also a very good place for kids. That's all Folks.

Suzie's has a lot of good Mexican food, like cheese crisps, tacos, enchiladas, and more. The service is sometimes slow but it is worth the wait. The Shrimp Javier is my favorite. I am a regular here, it's that good. The cheese enchiladas are  pretty good too. It's also kid-friendly which is nice. They also have cold beer, which is nice. Its not expensive, and that's nice too. Its a nice place to go to!!!

This is a good park, its small but fast. There is an anti-graffiti coating on the concrete that makes for a unique surface to ride on. I wouldn't go as far to say it is slick but it takes less lateral force to throw wheel slides and they go a bit further. Watch out there are kids, but don't sweat it kids have more resiliency than you'd think.

There is not much in downtown mesa that is not closed, closing, or newly opened. Most shops in dowtown mesa last a few months at best then fold up. Mango's is an exception to the rule. They have been there a while, the food is excellent, the price is inexpensive, service fast and freindly, and the outside seating is nice. Check this place out, its pretty much your only choice in downtown mesa, but it's still pretty good!

Pretty good food and service. I got the Drunken noodles which were excellent. Its clean and is a pretty typical thai place. One thing is the hours are kinda limiting. I was there on a Thursday night, and they stopped seating people at 8:15. That is a little bit extreme, its not even dark by then in the summer. I have to deduct 2 stars for that, because that is really stupid to do.

Are you kidding me?  I was disappointed after seeing all the good reviews. It is fast food BBQ. If you want a McRib and McDonalds is not Serving them go here. Do not go here if you want real BBQ. This place sucks!

This location is new and food is delicious. I saw it open up on my daily commute and had to stop in.  **I love this place**. The fact it's less than a mile from my house is a extra bonus. Their approach is classic Thai. They are nice with the spice and use quality ingredients. Maybe it's because they just opened but you can tell they take pride in what they do here. The service is polite and attentive. The dishes arrived quickly and were well sized. Although I had Dinner here, I am sure this place would have fast enough service for lunch. I have to do my weekday lunches downtown, there is a Thai Basil there too but its an absolute zoo at lunchtime.   Thai Basil A +++(A great dish and the namesake) The veggies A+ (Very fresh) Noodles A++ (Perfectly cooked)  Price: Very Reasonable

This place sucks, overpriced and no flavor, its really a zero star place. If you like taste less chain restaurants go here, it is one of those chili's or red lobster or some such

Its hard to find a good shop, ans its also hard to find an honest mechanic. This place is both, which is very impressive. I usually do mostly all my own auto work but in my current situation I don't have the facilities. It is super annoying and typical to get overcharged and lied to when going to a mechanic, since i know cars I can not accept this type of B.S. This place has a very knowledgeable, helpful staff and has the right equipment as well. I highly recommend AK Automotive. This place is a good 1/2 hour drive from me, but it's well worth it. "These guys are straight up good"

Other than the grocery store, this is the best place at Mekong. Large servings. Clean. Great texture on the shaved ice. They do it right.

This place is legit. Good size portions and good price. You really can't go wrong, one caveat is that their primary meat is pork, which is correct and cool if you like pork, but I can see it being a problem with some ppl. Clean and friendly staff. Disco bathroom. Cool art. Cool place
