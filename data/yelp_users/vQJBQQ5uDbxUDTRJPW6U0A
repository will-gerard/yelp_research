Watch out for the shady Phoenicians who can't keep their freaking hands to themselves!!  My boyfriend and I had booked a trip to the Phoenix area to go mountain biking.  We only live about 2 hours away, so we had a nice few days away from home planned, including biking, a movie at a theater that serves food and beer, a trip to the Botanical Gardens, and a visit with family. This hotel is super cute...and it's dog friendly, which is a plus since we get tired of boarding our dogs every time we want to take a trip.  The people at the front desk were incredibly friendly and helpful.  The hotel room was very unique and cute.  The rooms were well appointed, clean, and quiet, and I loved the greenspace across the way from the hotel to go biking, walking, etc.  That's the good.  Now the bad.  So we went to Scottsdale for a mountain biking trip.  And on the first night, our bikes were stolen off the back of our vehicle.  Not that we had left them on the back unsecured...we had a pretty burly cable attached to our bike carrier securing our bikes.  Apparently not secure nor burly enough.  The hotel doesn't have any sort of security cams in the parking lot either.  We had booked a double queen room, and unfortunately there really wasn't space in the hotel room for two big mountain bikes, so that's why we left them locked up outside.  It ruined the entire vacation and we ended up leaving the very next day.  The hotel staff was really good about working with Hotwire to get us our money back.  So just be careful about what you leave in/on your car.  I don't think this situation is unique to this hotel either...the Phoenix metro is crawling with human vermin looking for any opportunity they can to steal whatever they can.  It's disheartening and awful and truth be told, I really don't care to go back to Phoenix any time in the near future.  But if I do go back, I'd definitely stay at this hotel again.  At the right price it's a great place to stay.  I just won't leave a dang thing outside/inside my vehicle.

What an interesting find in the Phoenix metro!  Brought to you by the same folks that run Joe's Real BBQ (also in Gilbert) this place is so fresh and so good.  Located in south Gilbert, you feel like you're eating outside in the country.  Phoenix couldn't feel farther away.    The food was fantastic, and there are a lot of fresh, whimsical, and interesting players on the menu.  I went for a burger with BBQ sauce, onion ring, bacon, and blue cheese...pretty much my standard burger toppings, and it didn't disappoint in the slightest.  Simon got the ahi tuna sandwich, and he said it was excellent.  We shared some garlic fries, which were covered in fresh garlic and parmesan cheese, and dripping in butter.  They were fantastic.  Luckily all of us ate them so that no one could accuse the other of having bad breath.    I loved that you have the option to eat outside, sitting on picnic tables underneath giant trees.  It's just not an environment that you see much in the valley.

I'm in love.  This place was amazing, and I wish I lived in Phoenix so I could come here more often.  I was here on a Monday night with some friends, and Monday just happens to be $5 burger night.  And these are some amazing burgers...good enough to pay full price, but what a steal at $5 a piece.  We all had the burger with the onion-bacon marmalade and garlic aioli.  I have no idea what onion-bacon marmalade is or how one goes about making it, but it was one of the best toppings I've ever had on a burger.  The beef was very flavorful and while I ordered my burger medium, it was slightly overcooked, but still good.  Brioche buns topped them off, and they were very tasty as well.  The fries were nice and crispy, and a perfect compliment to the burgers.  Nice selection of beers on tap and in bottles, and a few specialty drinks in addition to the full bar.  There were also a few musicians taking turns performing, and they were very nice to listen to.  Not sure if this a regular Monday occurance or not, but I enjoyed the music.  It wasn't too loud either...we still have conversations without shouting while the artists were performing.  Great pub!

I live in Flagstaff and have been putting off getting my pants hemmed for years. Finally I went in with 8 pairs of Wunder Unders to be hemmed. The associates working at this location are amazing! They were all super friendly and nice and took the time to have me try on every pair of pants to make sure they were measured appropriately. It was right before Memorial Day weekend, so I assumed it would take longer than usual to get the pants back (I wasn't in a rush, regardless), but the pants were shipped to me via FedEx and arrived less than one week after I dropped them off. The manager even enclosed a handwritten thank-you note with the pants. :) So not only are these guys friendly, they're efficient as well! The hemming is perfect, and I'm looking forward to wearing my improved pants! Thanks guys!
