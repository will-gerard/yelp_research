First & foremost let me express my utter discord & pure bewilderment at the astonishing lack of basic human understand of the concept of what customer service actually means & or is.  I signed up of for a membership, and enjoyed the massages at this spa. The masseuses there are fantastic & very professional.  I recently canceled my membership because I received a job offer & would be moving out of state & unable to use their spa.  They proceeded to charge me $100 as a termination fee. When I called & questioned them about this, they agreed that "logic has nothing to do with this" and "it is what it is, sorry"  This is simply unacceptable, a business should not be so greedy that $100 is the price they pay to show the true colors of the owners & the back office.  I would recommend this place, but in moral good conscious I can not. I feel sorry for the employees that work for people who are so barbaric in their approach to business that "common sense" is not a part of their moral conduct.   If I can prevent further experiences from happening to trusting patrons then I have done my job.

There are Jewelry people, then there's Ryan.  I was referred to Ryan by a close friend of mine to buy my Wife's Engagement Ring.  Seeing as I was on a budget & had as much of a clue about Jewelry as Vin Diesel has for acting, I was naive and just knew I wanted something awesome for my bride to be.  I'm in sales myself & know retailers will rip you off & rob you blind, so the idea about going to the source (no pun intended) was very logical to me.  Not only did Ryan instantly make me feel comfortable, he held my hand through the entire ring design process & from the jump was mindful of my budget.  Where a lot of retailers make you feel like an idiot for not knowing their terms & how diamonds & rings work, Ryan spoke to me in laymen's terms & made it extremely easy to know what I was doing.  After helping me design a stunning one of a kind engagement ring, Ryan called & kept me in the loop every step of the way as the ring was being created.   Not only did he deliver on his promised date, he also got it in early!  He then followed up consistently to make sure it was perfect & that of course the ring did the job!  My wife & I went back to him for my wedding band (which btw is Badass) and we're going to be designing my wife's wedding back later this year with him as well.  You have a lot of choices in buying jewelry, but very rarely can you work with someone who has a genuine passion for serving others & making you feel like family.  Thank you Ryan, God bless you man, you made this dream a reality!  - Jared Sawyer -

The wait time, and general customer base of pompous douchers & douchettess are worth it.  The food here is over the top good, and obviously healthy. While it is a bit on the pricey side, what you're eating is worth the cost. Love this place!

Trinity is simply amazing, probably the most relaxing massage I've ever had. I was insanely stressed out & it basically melted away. It's hard to relax at a lot of commercialized chains, so me to basically fall asleep was awesome! I'm referring everyone

Apparently being fast only applies to locations that are with in a .5 mile radius. Make a note if you live in Old Town but you're more than .5 miles away they won't deliver. Great marketing ploy though. #FirstWorldProblems

I'm from Portland Oregon, I am from the land of coffee perfected. No I'm not talking Starbucks, gross. I'm talking local hand crafted coffee micro brews who aren't commercialized and actually take pride in their coffee, and believe it should be an enjoyable experience.  This place has it in spades.   If you're looking for a great environment, incredible eats, and absurdly awesome coffee, you've got to plan on making a stop here.  Mavericks makes you feel like it's 48 degrees and raining outside, even when it's really 126 & sunny.   The customer service is beyond excellent, you can tell these guys take a ton of pride in their work & it comes through in their incredible coffee.  I got the flat white, & I would recommended this to anyone who loves coffee.  If I could give this place 10 stars I would.   I will be a regular!
