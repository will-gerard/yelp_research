I will never go elsewhere.  They offer free checks, rotation, and they fixed the screw hole that I picked up at no charge.  As far as I'm concerned, there is no other place for my tires.

The lobster spinach queso is a must!  I've been here 3 times and never been disappointed.  I've also tried something new every time..

Disgusting!  Priceline listed this as a 4 star resort in Scottsdale.  Bait and switch, this is at best, 3 stars.  They claimed it was like a Hyatt...  Lies.  There's a $30/night resort fee which seems like, I over paid for spotty wi-fi, because every hotel in Scottsdale has pools and hot tubs, so there's not much worth paying that for.  Frankly, turning on my phone's hot spot is faster and cheaper.  We walked into our room, and immediately smelled mildew, which we identified later as mold in the bathroom.  No matter how low we turned the A/C down, we couldn't get rid of the smell over the two days we were there.  Next, we find a stain or dirt on our pillow case.  Gross.  The bedding had tears in it too.  There were cracks in the bottom of the door seal, allowing for plenty of room for Arizona's famous scorpions to walk through.  Stay away.  There are 4 star hotels very nearby for the same price.

So, Travis took the social media "Norm" of tackling this online, and tried to fix on the phone... Sadly, he challenged every negative I posted, essentially calling me wrong, starting with "it's not mold, because mold can't grow with our cleaning schedule". But after five minutes, he admitted it was mildew... So, mold can't grow with their aggressive cleaning plan, but mildew is acceptable to them.  Then he suggested that they are 4 star, because they have suites, restaurants, a spa, and their pool/hot tub.  And in the same sentence admitted that their standard rooms leave something to be desired, but they're working in it...  Allthewhile, trying to convince me that they're four stars...  Don't let the attempt at chatting with me in this post fool you.  They don't care, and Travis tried to prove me wrong the entire conversation.  In the end, he suggested if I wanted to try the mildew infested, cockroach-ridden, "4-star". 'Because they have a spa and restaurant (meaning they agree that quality has nothing to do with that rating)' I should call him, since I have his number now"..  Seems easier to just skip this craphole, and go Hyatt anywhere...  Or, La Quinta... Same room quality.... And they have a pool too, and faster internet, with no resort fees.    Dropping them from 2 stars to 1.  If I could go zero...

Tried a few items and a flight of all of their craft brews.  Service was great as well as the food.  The manager came over and chatted us up and offered up a sample of their Octoberfest, which was really good as well.  I will definitely come back.  Try the baby brats

The pharmacy is filled with insensitive, rude, and unprofessional people.  My wife had an issue with a new insurance card, after they called and told her that her prescription was filled and to come pick it up, and when she went in the card showed invalid.  So rather than find solutions, they stood around and looked at her like she was stupid.  No, "can you pay out of pocket?" Or "maybe we can call your insurance carrier?".  Nothing!  I will, not only never fill a prescription there again, I will also be shopping at Winco down the road from now on.  No fuel points are worth being humiliated by a staff of service workers.  And frankly, you can get better gas prices on Litchfield and Bell.  After 15 years of going to the same store for just about everything, they alienated a customer in 5 minutes.  Service is dead at Fry's.  Update - After talking to our benefit company, Fry's input a number wrong when processing our insurance and rather than trying again, or confirming with my wife, they made a decision to embarrass her.    I repeat, my insurance was valid, Fry's made a mistake that my wife paid for.

So, I'm reading the reviews and notice that the super angry ones are a little older.  I think it's important to say, from my perspective, that if Yelp were around when they first opened, I might have given it one star too.  But, like a good business should, they listened and replaced people that needed to go.    My wife and I decided to walk in again, but told each other "we're not buying from them, we don't like them" we were just going to learn.  A young salesperson named Steven (or Stephen) asked what we were looking for.  He was nice, informative, not pushy, and frankly somewhat consultative with us in what we might need.  Well, when you like a sales person who's that helpful, you have to buy from them, so we did.  Now, 9 months later we had an ignition switch die on us.  As my daughter was pulling out the Ranger, it died right in our front yard.  I called Tony over there (he has an east coast accent, but we'll let that slide) and told him what was going on.  First thing Tuesday, when they opened, Tony calls and says the truck is on the way to pick up my Ranger.  Today, Wednesday, Tony calls and tells me it's fixed, covered by warranty (including the pickup), and to come get it.  As I started to write this, I was going to mark it at 4 stars.  I don't just give out 5 unless it's mind blowing food.  One of the low score reasons was 1 person during the purchase of the Ranger, we just didn't like him.  But Steven was great, Cody was incredibly informative (and in fact stayed open one night when I blew a tire, until I got there so I wasn't stuck on a jack on Bell Rd.)  But my wife and I just didn't like this one person at all.  But, between Steven, Cody, and now Tony's fast service and response to our needs, I decided to add the 5th star.  Seriously, if you're looking to get started with something for off road or hunting, go in there talk to these guys.  If a business is represented by it's people, then Ride Now Surprise is doing great!

Good food, as far as I can tell since in 45 minutes we have only gotten our appetizer.  So far, the only reason to come is to get $35 in free drinks.  Stay away!

I'm not a big breakfast eater but when I'm in the mood, I'll drive the 110 city blocks to eat here.  They have great iced tea.  And their green Mama Burn sauce is better than Tabasco.

We read reviews on this show before we went and anything less than a 4 is a bitter bitter angry troll.  This was hilarious, scary, entertaining, and worth every penny!  Go watch this show, I would do it a second time.  Very family friendly!

This place is a must hit.  I had a Cabernet burger, and hands down its the best gormet style burger I've ever eaten.  It's messy, just ask for extra napkins, and don't mess with what it comes with.  As is, it's mix of flavors will soon make you disappointed with any other burger.  It's an unusual environment, as someone said earlier, it's a little intimidating when you walk in, but stay, sit, and enjoy.    My wife and I will be going back.

I was surprised to see this hotel pop up as 4 stars, usually us West-Siders have to go all the way downtown or to Scottsdale for a nice hotel.  Seeing as I go to Westgate often, I thought, 'what the heck, it's my anniversary'.  Well, was I surprised to see this beautiful hotel with a stunning water feature inside, amazing service, and a great restaurant.  Immediately the woman at registration upgraded us to a king sized bed, even though that was a more expensive option online.  As she checked us in and we were chatting, we found out there was an event at the Cardinals stadium next door and a dance event there as well, which explained why it was so busy.  When she asked us what brought us in, and we told her it was our 23rd anniversary, she immediately comped us 2 breakfasts in the morning, and waived our parking fee.  I already thought the hotel was worth what we paid for it, but they went so far beyond my expectations, I'll stay again.

Best place to buy wine in town.  Buy their brand Zinfandel, and you'll be pleased in your investment.  Some other stuff, is a little pricey, but they're all non-GMO.

It's been a week, and I really like this place.  When we were looking online, it was hard to find places that offer yoga in Surprise, AZ, come to find out, these guys have a ton of classes each week for lots, including yoga.  It's a little more expensive than I've seen in other fitness centers, especially because there's usually a line for the ab machines, no matter when I've been there, which is why it's not 5 stars (not enough ab/oblique machines).  It's clean, they give you towels for your workout and shower afterwards.  There are plenty of cardio machines and have cardio-theater, which is great for people like me who just need to push through it.  Really nice staff there, always with a hello/goodbye for the members.

The tropical tea is delicious!  Really well cooked burger.  They have bison, angus, Kobe, and more.  Amber was super fun, and never missed a beat in the 7 iced teas I had.    Also, start with the bacon cheese jalape√±o fries.  Comes with an aioli that's great.  And, only $5.  We'll be back for sure.

They get one star only because there is no zero star option on yelp. They have now ruined two of my shirts both from Nordstrom both extremely expensive both had holes ripped in them by their machines. Basically when my wife went to tell the guy that it didn't have a hole when she brought it in, he pretty much called her a liar.  Have a look at the shirt.  Notice the pressed lines that would be post cleaning, as they come home from my trips I a bag.

This place is quite good, we came for the lunch buffet at noon on a Friday.  It wasn't too crowded, and it was very quiet.  They do a cool thing where they keep the rice in a closed cooker, so it doesn't dry out in a chaffing dish.  There's a rice paddle in water next to it.  This is also valuable info if you've not been here before.  Just pop the button and open the lid.  I had spinach, goat, and chicken tikka masala.  The spinach was bland, stay away.  But the goat was quite good.  You have to fight it off the bone a bit, but it was worth the struggle.  My favorite was the chicken.  It was tender and moist, not what I was expecting from a buffet.  It is what will bring us back.  They also had gulab jamun in the cold section.  They are small baked balls made of sugar, flour, sugar, yogurt, and sugar.  Try them!

Waffle nachos were good.  That's where it ends.  Service was slow, ran out of iced tea twice, took 10 full minutes for my kids' shake, and the burgers were bland.  Skip it altogether.

Holy cow!  The server recommended her favorites and we ordered both and they offered to split them for us to try both.  Bothe were out of the park!  My wife even liked the cole slaw, and she hates cole slaw.  Start with the pretzel and fondue appy, it's fantastic.  Come hungry, nothing is bad!  Oh, and she brought me a to go cup of their delicious iced tea.  Killer service

JenCor has taken care of my lawn and trees for 7 years, and I wouldn't change a thing.  I have had the best small patch of lawn in my neighborhood for years, and he know exactly when it's time to trim my trees, as they can get in the way of my pool entry.  He's never raised his prices on me, though I know gas has gone up, and he always reseeds my lawn, so I have winter grass.  I have recommended them to several of my neighbors, and many are customers as well, due to their price and consistency.

The owner promised they'd do better, and he's a man of his word.  They confirmed my ride home, which I hope is a new process.  Again, the drivers are fantastic.  A great bunch of people to be stuck in traffic with.

My wife and I went in tonight, as we had planned a party and completely forgotten to get food.  We asked if we could buy a few sandwiches and maybe get a tray to deliver them to our guests, as they have a 24 hour catering notice policy.  Someone, who I can only assume is a manager of some kind, said, it's not busy right now, why don't we see if we can pull it off.  So, we went and grabbed our other items for the party, came back 20 minutes later, and they had our catered sandwiches ready to go, packaged up with condiments.  Life Savers!!!  I will cater with them again, without a doubt!

Skip it, skip it, skip it.  Food was just okay, service was less than okay, and the prices for the food were the equivalent to spending steak money on a 10% patty.  When my wife asked the server what was on tap, he said "nothing" and walked away with no suggestions,  If you find yourself stuck at Mandalay Bay on a Sunday night, understand: They know it too.    They shut everything down but this hole, so you have no choice on where to go.  Tip, order a Pizza or walk to Jack in the Box!

Frankly, I can't rate the food because after twenty (20) minutes of waiting for someone to take a drink order, or even be welcomed, we walked out.  There were at least a dozen empty tables in the restaurant.  Do yourself a favor, go to any of the 15 restaurants nearby who want to earn your business.

Friday night, sat in the patio area, food was great.  Pleasantly surprised by the brats and sauerkraut.  Pitchers are reasonable, and the other three in my party enjoyed their food.  Will come back for sure!

Start with the cheddar bacon dip.  Don't think about it, just do it.  You'll thank me later.  This place is really pretty good.  Their appys are tasty, and not too expensive, and the lunch menu is very reasonable.  I had a steak sandwich, which was fantastic, and my wife had mussels.  All around good.  The only downside I would give them is they tend to over-season their steaks for my tastes.  They're good steaks, the seasoning is good as well, just too much of it for me.  The remedy for us, was simply to ask for only one side of the steak seasoned or light seasoning, that seemed to do the trick for us.  I will go back.

It's like our own Carnegie Deli in Surprise!  Bagels and lox?  Check!  More pastrami on a sandwich than any one human can eat in a sitting?  Check!  Bialys? Knishes?  Corned beef?  Check, check, check!  If you love a New York deli, but hate freezing your arse off, Archie's is for you!

My expensive TV I bought at Conns started to go on the fritz about 9 months after I bought it.  Lines through the picture, messing up the images.  They sent someone out to look at it, told us it needed to be replaced, then disappeared.  They claimed that Sharp would call to make arrangements.  So the holidays come and go, no call, and 6 weeks later I have to track Conns down on what's going on.  She shortly looks up my account, tells me we should have called Sharp (which no one mentioned ever).  I told her that the service person told us someone would call, and her response was "We can't help it if Sharp didn't call you".  While that's accurate, in my company, someone would have followed up to see if we had our issue resolved.  After calling Sharp and tracking down the issues, it turns out Conns didn't actually complete the process with Sharp.  Amazing, two giant companies like that playing the blame game.

YES!  All the deliciousness of table tepanyaki, but about $10 a plate less.  I had a steak and chicken combo, the steak was perfect, but the chicken was teriyaki.  Not my favorite, but that's on me, not them.  For a couple of bucks more, I will do the fillet mignon next time.  Have you ever cooked broccoli or a green vegetable so perfectly, it's that perfect green color and still has the right amount of crunch to it?  All the veggies come out that way.  Piping hot, perfect veggies, gooey fried rice.  All the elements of a killer meal, not to mention the miso and salad.   This is our second time here, and we'll probably be back for lunch tomorrow.
