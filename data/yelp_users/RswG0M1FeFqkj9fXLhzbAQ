We had such a great experience. Rocky, the bartender, was such an amazing server. We recommend her every time.!!!!

I just moved and this location was closest to me. When I first arrived my thoughts were, "It looks big on the outside.... But I bet it's sooooo ghetto in there. Ugh." But as soon as I walked in, I was greatly met with smiling faces and a two story gym.!   I have gone at every time you could possibly imagine. Weekends, weekdays, night time, morning, evening. And no matter what time I go there, it is always empty.! I love it.!!!   I would say the only thing that bothers me is the people who ARE there are men and they just stare with no shame. Quite annoying, but I try to ignore it.

I love Olive Garden.! I took my boyfriend here for his first time the other week. He enjoyed it very much! This restaurant is pretty busy, probably because of location. We lucked out, a huge party left as we say down. Our waitress was amazing.! She definitely more than made up for the crowdedness. Food was quick and delicious.

Here is an Awesome story. My boyfriend and I went to get pedicures together and this was the chosen place.! We LOVED them. They were attentive, friendly, and most importantly CHEAP.! Super close to home and did such a great job. I was very impressed, being it was the first place we checked out randomly. Would definitely recommend .!

Me and the parental unit decided to have a day together :) We were walk-ins, but were sat down right away for our pedicures. The service was fantastic!! We had the basic spa pedicure with callous remover. The pedicure includes lotion massage, hot stone rub, and hot towels. They offered us water and premium customer service. I will definitely be coming here from now on. 100% recommend VS Nails.

We came in for a cold/checkup. There were many people in the lobby, but service was quick and appropriate for how busy it was. The staff were nothing but polite and friendly. We will definitely come here again, if need be. :)

We live right down the street, and always go to this location. I mean it's convenient...... BUT This location is horrible.  The drive thru is sloooowwwwww.!!! They never get our order correct. Ever.  The ladies are decently nice, but still have attitude.  The meat is always dry and overcooked.   We will be driving a little farther to a different location. Hopefully that one isn't as bad.  This one needs to shape up a little more. But I guess it IS fast food.

Very, very impressed.!! When me and my boyfriend first walked in, we thought, "oh man, this is a tiny store." We didn't have too high of hopes for what was inside. I was skeptical at first, thinking this place would be like rent a center, where they charge you x300% above with major interest and shitty products. But I was wronnngggg,  we were greeted with a friendly face who wasn't the least bit pushy. Our salesman was very helpful and knowledgeable of any questions we had.  And we had a TON of questions. But he stayed patient with us, let us roam around, and encouraged us to compare beds.  We got a king bed and 2 pillows within 45 minutes of being there. They have 0% interest, as long as you pay on time, low monthly payments, a great warranty on their products, and great customer service.   Also....... we were able to schedule a bed drop off the next morning. Between 9 and 12. I figured they would be like other places and not show up until 11:59. But nope, sure enough the movers showed up at 9:15.!!!! We were ecstatic. They brought the bed up, no problem. They moved our old bed into the guest bedroom instantly. And they were out of the house by 9:35. Amazing.!! I would 100% recommend this store. And this company. It's a great way to build credit and get what you want.
