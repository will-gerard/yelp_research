This is consistently one of the slowest Starbucks I go to. There seems to be constant turnover in staff. Quality of products are similar to all other Starbucks

Great atmosphere, great steak. Pricey though. If too pricey for you they have a great happy hour

Found this dog park 3 months ago & it's great. There appears to be a very conscientious group of regulars that help make it very pleasant experience.  I believe my dog got an eye infection there but I guess that's an expected possibility just like taking your kids to the park where they may catch something from other children.
