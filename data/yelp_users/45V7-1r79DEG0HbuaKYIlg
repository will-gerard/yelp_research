I've been to performances both on the Main-stage and the Little Theatre. The acoustics are good, not a bad seat in either room.  Ticket pricing is very fair - especially compared to most other major cities. There's also a great mix of events - at least two or three every season that I look forward to seeing. Also - one advantage both Phoenix Theatre and Gammage have over most venues in other cities (Or Herberger) is the abundance of free parking!  Convenient to a Light Rail stop as well - almost like living in a "real" city!  Conveniently, I work second shift close to the Theatre - so weekday matinees fit into my schedule (and budget) perfectly.  Glad to have this venue - and glad to see how many people support it locally - not a lot of empty seats at any performance I've been to!

So nice to have this gen across the street from my office!  The good and bad news - the sushi (spicy tuna and Cali rolls.) while they are everything I've come to expect and want from them, they are made in limited quantity.  All but once, they are sold out by the time I get there.  So, good that I know they're fresh and not sitting for days on end - bad that I don't get them when I want them.  Love the iced green tea. The teryaki chicken and veggie bowl is one of my favorites!  Everything I have ordered has been very fresh and flavorful.  Fair prices, large portions.  It's American style Japanese fast food at it's finest - and much better value than most (Yoshi, Tokyo Express, Shogun Express, etc.). Plus - it just feels better to deal with locals than a chain.

Over the past decade or so, I've had plenty of opportunities to attend events at the Alwun House. Engagement parties; a recent liqueur, beer and mead tasting; and fetish soirees.  I really like the space. Well, the yard. Sure - the house is cool - and I do love the concept of an art space in a historic home.  I am happy to support a place that supports local artists and artisans . But I LOVE the yard. Koi ponds, sculpture, private areas and mature landscaping. It's a fantastic place for an intimate event.  Whether the group has been 40 or 200, the place is cozy with plenty of room to mingle.   Overall, Alwun House is one of my favorite venues for an event here in town. And I am still looking for the perfect event to host there.  Another reviewer mentioned the neighborhood has gotten shady. Or something like that.  I was confused by this.  The house is at 12st St and Roosevelt.  TURNING Shady?  I've only been in town since 1985 - but it's been "shady" at least that long!  Hello, it's just beyond the bright lights of downtown. It's not a bad area by any means - but you should pretend you're just outside the downtown area of any real city. Alone at night is silly. Alone at night and wearing flashy baubles or having an expensive camera dangling from your neck is just downright stupid.  Follow the rules of common city sense, and there's no need to fear.

My roommate and I were throwing a party, and I was brave enough to decide to do a full Louisiana style shrimp boil. It's not shrimp season. :( The price per pound was more than I expected - and I realized that either a Hispanic or Asian market is the way to go for getting a good deal. Ranch Market had medium shrimp, shell and head on, in frozen 4 pound boxes. Perfect - as I was getting 20 pounds! The roommate and I headed down around noon on Saturday. We were both hungry, so decided to grab a bite before shopping. He had a bowl of posole and a quesadilla. I wanted the sopa - but they weren't offered that day, so opted for the taco salad with carne asada instead. Delicioso! I opted for a jamaica to wash it down - but now the watermelon agua fresca is calling to me! The dining area (lots of picnic tables) was clean. The salsa/condiment bar was fresh and well stocked. Every employee we dealt with was friendly and efficient. After filling our bellies, we got some produce (all was very fresh, well displayed and notably less expensive than the Fry's near the house), picked up the shrimp and headed out. I know I will be back for more specialty items, produce, meat and fish - and the bakery section! It's a bit far out of my way to do the regular weekly grocery shopping here - especially as we're getting into summer and I don't know I could get perishables home before they perish...but Ranch is hitting my rotation for sure!

I was introduced to Ryan's many years ago when I needed a crate. And while I was thrilled with the price and how quickly they shipped, I had forgotten all about them.  Until this week - I found myself in need of yet another doggie bed (mine treats hers as a chew toy), and happened to notice Ryan's building on my way to work. Funny how the Universe puts things in front of you - I have driven this way 5X per week for over two years - and JUST noticed it!  Other reviews are correct - limited business hours, poor air temperature control in the warehouse, purse/bag/backpack check in front room. $25 minimum purchase for walk in customers.  And if you go in knowing this - none of it is a big deal!  What is the big deal about this place? I got a large new dog bed, a choke chain and FIVE new toys for less than other pet retailers wanted for just the bed. It really is 25-50% off retail consistently.  Next time, I will plan on leaving more time to explore and pick out lots of treats for my bed destroying sweetheart.   Collars and leashes. Treats and beds. Shampoos and toys. This place has everything but the food!

One of my roommates was extolling the beauty of Bosa.  I asked if they were as good as Rainbow, but she had never tried Rainbow.  So - we decided to do a taste test.  Three of us in the house - so we would get 3 different (but like) donuts from each.  The plan was to bring them back home, cut to sample size, and note flavor, texture and overall preference.  The guy roommate's favorite is glazed raised.  The gal leans to sugar raised and I figured glazed old fashioned is a safe baseline for taste testing.  We went to Rainbow first.  No problem getting the donuts we wanted.  I also picked up a half dozen donut holes.  Was not thrilled to be charged $0.50 for the box, but c'est la vie.  Girl roommate also got a watermelon frappe type of drink.  A bit sweet for my tastes, but very, very watermelony.  Next stop Bosa.  They didn't have regular sugar raised - used powdered sugar instead.  (I have a hard time trusting that the regular sugar didn't stick - somehow they managed to make it work at Rainbow!)  So the granulated vs. powdered sugar raised would not be as scientific a comparison, but we'd make do.  No problem with the glzed and old fashioned.  We also picked up ham and swiss croissants.  One can never have too much pastry, right? :)  Results -       Glazed raised - Bosa was slightly denser and chewier - more mouth satisfaction.  Rainbow was cloudlike fluffy and light.  Great texture, but we didn't feel satisfied from chewing.  Rainbow was slightly sweeter.           ~Votes - 3 for Bosa.~      Old Fashioned - textures were identical.  Rainbow had a slight lemon (or maybe aspatrame?) flavor in the back end of the tasting.           ~Votes - 1 slight lean to Bosa, 2 Draw~      Sugar raised - texture of donut was identical to glazed raised above.  (duh - same donut, different topping.)  The gal roomie likes granulated.  The guy roomie preferred the powdered.  I liked both.           ~Votes - 1 Bosa, 1 Rainbow, 1 Draw.  So, Bosa comes out with a slight edge.  And we came out with a slight sugar rush.  I can't help but wonder what our next scientific food research challenge will be!

One of my favorite places in town! DBG can be many things to many people - Fun, Entertainment, Relaxation, Education, and Inspiration! While the plants are the point - and they have a HUGE collection of desert plants, cacti and succulents, it's easy to find so much in the garden that the plants are merely a breathtaking backdrop. There are classes available (from gardening to cooking, photography to yoga - a HUGE range of learning courses - camps for children, too!), concert series, cultural celebrations, dinners, festivals and more. Each spring, the butterfly pavilion comes alive with many species of butterflies - on my last visit, our timing was lucky and we got to watch one emerge from her cocoon. The colors of the desert in bloom during the spring are intense and amazing. The desert takes on a completely different feel when the cacti and wildflowers are in bloom...Desert Botanical Garden provides a place to see several regions of plants in one easily accessible place.  While conveniently located on the Scottsdale/Tempe/Phoenix border, once inside the property, it's easy to forget you're in the city. It truly is an urban oasis. Well worth the cost of membership if you go more than twice a year, too!

RIP, Mr. Wax. I read in New Times that Dennis, the long time owner of Tracks in Wax, recently passed. For now, the plan is the store will go on without him. I'm quietly optimistic - but will miss his sense of humor and encyclopaedic music knowledge.  Last time I was in with a girlfriend, we ended up wrestling over Sisters Of Mercy's "First and Last and Always."  She won, but promised me visitation rights.  (Bitch doesn't even have a record player!!)  Sorry, I digress.  I walked out with (get your collective geek squeals in unison) the original 2 record set of the radio broadcast of Orson Welles' "War of the Worlds." Granted, it's not music - but SQUEE!  I can't wait to play it on a dark and stormy night!  It was a geektacular moment in my life, to be sure!  Selection is solid - but keeping in mind it's used music - what's hard to find is still hard to find.  Dennis told me he coulnd't keep Leonard Cohen or Tom Waits in stock no matter how much he brought in. Damn other record collectors that get there wanting the same things I do!  I really hope Tracks in Wax continues - it's a special and magical place.

I've been coming to Cherry Blossom since they were the little bakery attached to Tokyo Express - before the Noodle Cafe idea was launched. I've sampled a good deal of the menu, and most of it is quite good. Most recently, we were a party of six for a luncheon of Yelp friends and to celebrate a birthday. I ordered the special lunch box (bento box) and think it was the best choice of the day! (But everyone I was with thinks they got the best item of the day - always a great sign!) Miso soup, 4 or 5 tempura items, half a spicy tuna roll, salad, and the entree of the day - in this case, very well seasoned beef and onions on rice.  Everything is consistently fresh and flavorful, and prices are fair.  Since I was aware of the "bakery" aspect of the cafe, I went in a few days before the lunch to order a surprise birthday cake. I was told the strawberry shortcake was the most popular, so I went with that. Everyone at the table loved it - and the birthday girl was sufficiently surprised and got to bring half of it home. The cake wasn't cheap - but while I didn't check the dessert prices for individual slices - I am guessing it would have been close to the same to order six separate desserts. So - if you have a decent size group - it's well worth it to buy the cake in advance!

First it was kosher. Then it was kosher-style. Now it's kosher again (and has been for several years.) The recipes never changed - the politics of this silly town did.  And all along, it's been my favorite little Jewish bakery in town. Chompies is nothing in comparison!  The Raspberry Delight cake has been my favorite cake EVER, consistently, for about 20 years. I've even given it as a birthday cake and anniversary cake to loved ones. Don't let the small size fool you - this thing packs a wallop of flavor!  The breads are always consistently really good. This morning, the Fantastic Mr. It's Complicated and I were in, and he opted for a marble rye. A gorgeous, perfect, deceptively heavy super crusty rye. YUM!  I avoid the butter cookies as much as I can. Mostly because once I eat one, I won't stop until they're all gone. Yes, I have eaten almost a full pound in one day. Not a pretty sight.  All the other cookies, cakes, mondelbread, hamentaschen, etc. are top notch, too.  So nice to have a real old school kosher bakery in the hood!

He cut me, he blew me, he did amazing things with his wide barrel shaft!  He got me high, then brought me back down so expertly and smoothly!  Now, if only I can find a man to say that about in a NOT "haircut at the salon" context!  Yesterday I went to get my hair done by Terre Steed, who has recently joined the crew at RAW.  The space is exactly what it should be.  A nice, small salon.  Great colors and placement.  Notably clean!  Good selection of product without being "in your face."  Friendly people!  My hair was admittedly a MESS.  It's been over a year since I've really gotten my hair done by a true pro - I've been getting trims at the beauty school and great clips as needed every few months - but no one I trusted for more than a trim.  I told Terre I wanted to keep the length, and becuase of my natural curls, should probably have some layers put in.  He agreed - and went to town!  For the first time in my life, I actually felt like a supermodel when he was done.  For the first time in my life, I actually thought I was HOT!  So yes, the salon is worth 5 stars.  The quality and value is definitely there!  The ego boost is worth 10 stars!  I actually cried (happy tears)when I got home and was playing with my hair in the mirror.  Who knew I could actually love my hair?  Thank you, Terre!!  As long as you're in the biz and I have a job, my mane is yours for life!

It's been about 2.5 years since I added my review for RAW Salon - and Terre Steed. The salon recently relocated to a larger space at Central and Thomas.  Still five stars for cleanliness, decor, product selection/availability, friendliness and of course, end result!  Last Saturday was the grand opening party. In addition to a cocktail and munchies, I received a gratis blow-out from Steven - who it seems I have known half my life, though we just met. Fantastic personality - fantastic blow-out!  Yesterday I got a cut from Terre. As always - amazing job and he is so easy to trust with my tresses. I look great and feel great. He works minor miracles and makes it seem to effortless. Amazing talent!  Love the new space - love the salon - LOVE my Terre! (But I am willing to share! Talent this big is too much for me to keep to myself!)

The Fantastic Mr. It's Complicated and I went here for lunch today, and as we'd experienced separately in the past - the food was great!  Based on the foods he's disgusted by, I didn't order what I was in the mood for - had he seen it, he may not have been able to eat at all. So I went with the New Yorker (corned beef, pastrami, slaw and Russian dressing) on rye with the slaw on the side. He had the Black Forest (turkey, corned beef, grilled onions and Swiss.) Both are served with pickles (I believe house-made) and fries. The bread is great, the meat quality is great - and as we both packed half a sandwich and most of the fries into boxes for another meal, we were reminded that maybe next time we should just share a sandwich.  Like all good delis - the portions are HUGE. And like all good Jewish delis - the service is subpar, the decor is hopelessly dated, the prices are definitely fair for the quality and quantity, and something about it just feels like "home."  I made a mistake though. I ordered coffee instead of a chocolate egg cream. Too few places make a decent egg cream  - and I missed my opportunity. Then again, that's a good excuse to have to go back soon! (As if I needed one!)

I appreciate the vegan and GF option on the menu. While I can pretty much eat anything across the board, enough of my dining buddies have restrictions that are made far less a hassle with this menu!  I've been in a few times through the years - always happy with the service and pizza.  Recently, we've had them deliver to my office a few times. I'm a fan because if I am (gasp!) not in the mood for pizza, I can get a small salad and breadsticks.   Everything has been fresh, quality and presentation solid - and I am consistently a happy camper!  Definitely a nice place to have in my work and home area - and so much better than any of the chains!

I've always had a blast here! I am not a gay man. My female friends are not gay men. And the Fantastic Mr. It's Complicated is not a gay man. Yes, Roscoes is a gay bar. But I've always been made to feel welcome, no matter who I am there with. The drinks are consistent with a well stocked full bar, service is quick, bathroom is clean (the ladies' room, anyway!) and they've done a nice job of putting together the smoking patio out back. On the most recent visit (Sunday late morning about a week ago), food was part of the game plan. I was a little nervous about bar food - especially right after waking up  - with only alcohol in my belly. (Don't judge!) Fantastic Mr. It's Complicated and I opted to split the breakfast plate with scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, hash browns and rye toast. It was a good decision since it was a lot of food. But - it was so good, I resented having to share it! The eggs, bacon, sausage and toast were all well prepared and tasty - but those hash browns - WOW! Fresh, crispy and so flavorful. Among the best hash browns I've ever had.  I took two turns at the build your own Bloody Mary bar - one of my favorite things about Sundays brunch! Sure - I could rave about the drink - but to get one like it, you'd have to invite me and buy me one - I'd be happy to make one for you, too! Our other companion (coincidentally, a gay man) had an order of the chicken wings. THEY.ARE.HUGE. I don't know that I've seen chicken wings that plump and meaty - and they smelled great! Not too many sports bars put a lot of energy into serving good food - and maybe that's the advantage of getting grub at a gay bar? No matter - whether for a quick drink, rounds of birthday shots with the girlfriends, or a football playoff Sunday brunch - I am definitely a fan of Roscoe's!

I hadn't considered reviewing this practice until my mom called this morning asking the name of the dentist I recently went to when I broke a molar.  Current lack of insurance is the ONLY reason I didn't call North Mountain!  The break happened at about 6pm, and I wanted to get it taken care of the next morning.  If my insurane existed, I know I could have called North Mountain first thing the next day and gotten in - that is how great they are with priority flexibility!  Sadly, I was left to call places that were open past 6pm, and price shopped getting the work done. Getting in first thing the next day is the ONLY good thing to report about the dentist I ended up going to. So I told my mom I could not recommend the recent dentist I went to - but could ABSOLUTELY steer her toward North Mountain Dentistry!  While I did see Dr. Rosen once, most of my visits for the years I was going were with Dr. Arak.  Bob D's review was spot on - everyone is very professional and upbeat and truly seems to like being there. Whether it was the attitude of the entire staff, the genuine caring about my mouth health, the lack of "upselling" and alarmist declarations of the work I "need" - or the ready availability of nitrous (I am a whimp!), the several years I was a patient at North Mountain was the only time in my life I really did go to the dentist twice a year for cleanings and checkups.  And as soon as I get insurance again, I will be back!

I adore Asian bakeries! Asahi is not the next great thing. Not a lot of time, attention or money has been invested in décor or a "wow" showroom. There's a small but decent selection of cookies and some pastry, but this business is all about the cakes. Fresh, not too sweet - and absolutely delicious! I'm partial to the regular white cake with whipped cream frosting and fresh fruit (inside and out.) A coworker opted to order a small chocolate cake and added the fruit - YUM! Instead of cupcakes - they do individual mini cake rolls. For my boss's birthday, we ordered 20 rolls - a bit of rolled sponge cake, fresh whipped cream, and a variety of strawberry, mandarin orange and kiwi fruit topped. Delicious, simple, non-messy dessert for 20 people - DONE! Best of all - the price! Assuming my time is worth *something* - there's no way I could produce cakes like this for as little money as Asahi charges. This isn't the sort of bakery that specializes in cool, funky cakes and I didn't see any fondant (but they may do some...I don't like fondant, so I didn't go out of my way to check.) But for a fresh, delicious cake that will be custom made for you on little short notice for a super low price? Asahi rocks!

With the size of the Jewish population in the Phoenix area, how is there no competitor to this place? If your loved one wants a traditional Jewish burial, and for the body to be prepared and cared for accordingly, Sinai is the only option.  I've now dealt with them twice - and both times SUCKED. I guess the positive is I have no more parents to bury and no siblings I am responsible for carrying out the last wishes for - so I will never have to deal with them again.  Almost ten years ago, my dad died. According to custom, he wanted to be buried in a plain pine box. This is normal and traditional. There is really no excuse for attempting to up-sell me on the coffin. None. I was quite clear on what he wanted.  That experience left a lingering bad memory, and recently, as my mom was dying, I spoke with the Rabbi about options not involving Sinai. Sadly, there are none. But he assured me it's a new generation running the place - and they are awesome. He even told me he would share with them my prior bad experience and ensure I was well taken care of this time around.  HA! Not only did the funeral director go out of her way to let me know our Rabbi was overcharging us for his services, but she made a comment that was more than a little insensitive and disrespectful to my mom's Christian husband.  PLEASE - someone, ANYONE - open a Jewish mortuary to compete with this group. Watch the prices fall dramatically overnight, and force the customer service to improve exponentially.

Well, I am clearly not the first to wax poetic about the chicken fried steak here. I miss the signage on the south side of the building with the count of how many have been sold.  Once upon a time, this was Lone Star. Then the chain came into town, and the name was changed to TexAz. Happily, that's the only thing that's changed. I've had many meals here - and have never left hungry.  Recently, the pattern has been a girlfriend and I meeting for lunch. We have iced teas (since I have to go right to work after), small salads and split a chicken fried steak. The plate comes with corn and a heaping pile of mashed potatoes with gravy. Ohhhh, that gravy! We save the biscuits for last - and smother them with butter and honey - dessert!  Everything has always been fresh and tasty. No culinary risks here, and nothing pushing the food envelope - just straightforward Texas comfort food. With some added flair. Cajun/Creole flavors make lots of appearances - and it all hits the spot.  The decor can be overwhelming - but there's so much eye candy it's impossible to be bored. Love all the signs and bumper stickers. Most are Texas-centric, but there are artifacts from all over the globe. (Personal note - three cheers for all the Kinky Friedman items!)  Good food, good drink, good times - HUGE portions at very fair prices!  Oh - and the bread pudding with whiskey sauce is kinda amazing!!

Sometimes, predictable is a good thing. A dear friend moved away and was coming to visit for a weekend. Turns out, despite being a sucker for anything chicken fried, she had never heard of TEXAZ. So we put together a small dinner party (8 of us) to celebrate her being in town.  The server was fantastic! We all came in at different times, she never missed a beat with greeting us, getting us drinks and taking care of all the substitutions and special requests in our food order. Everything arrived exactly as ordered - and we were a happy and full group of people.  The food is still consistent, the ambiance is still kitschy Texas roadhouse dive, the prices are still very reasonable and I am still super happy TEXAS is in my hood.

Now accepts plastic!  Now accepts plastic!  Did you hear me?  Harvey's now accepts plastic!  I've lived around the corner from Harvey's for a little over 4 years now.  I had lunch there once in the mid 1990's, and went in to watch a Suns playoff game a few years back when my friend was decked out in Spurs gear and we were nearly lynched at Half Moon.  Quick lunch with a girlfriend who was in the mood for a burger about a year ago.    While I love, and I do mean LOVE a good dive bar, this place scared the crap out of me.  I'm young, not hideous, female, and not of the meth-head variety - so not only did I not blend, but I felt targeted.  Sad, really.  The ONE bar within easy drunk stumbling distance from my house, and I wasn't happy going there.  During a weekday for lunch was more or less okay.  But evenings are when the freaks come out.  And I don't mean the freaks like me.  I mean the dangerous crazy ones - not just the fun crazy ones.  There's a difference!  Well, enter the new roommate.  He was disinclined to believe my review, and insisted we go.  I resisted until late Saturday night, when he came home at 1am and insisted I get dressed so we could go there for an hour.  Maybe I was tired.  Maybe I needed a change of pace.  Whatever the reason, I gave in, got dressed and we walked over to Harvey's.  YAY!  According to Echo, the bartender (yes, it's her real name.  her parents are hippies like mine), the owner has been working hard to improve the place (read: clientele) for over a year.  It shows!    Echo is three shades of awesome - the perfect gal to be running the bar!  Easy smile, quick wit, great sense of humor and the talent to mix a great drink while cooking any of the grub from the menu.  She is a one woman show and pulls it off like a champ!  June drink specials included $2.00 Beam 5 Star bourbon, Yukon Jack, and I don't remember what else.  I asked for a bourbon and coke, the roommate asked for his bourbon neat.  (Brave - cheap bourbon *needs* to be cut with something!).  The pour is solid and consistent  Oh, and did I mention you can get a mixed drink, anytime day or night for just two bucks?  For $2!! Two drinks for me, two shots for him, a beer chaser for him and a cheese wineburger split between us.  Under $14!!  Holy hell, it's cheaper to drink here than it is at home!  And at home - we don't have the entertainment of the other patrons.  Like Cowboy who would do the splits on demand.  And suggest my roommate go through the needed steps for a game of "rodeo" with his girlfriend. You just can't make this up! Oh - and he bestowed slightly drunk me with a new nickname. Apparently, I am a "prick ass bitch."  I don't know how he meant it, but I am taking it as a compliment and will wear it with pride!  Oh, yes.  I will certainly be back!  A LOT.

I've lived in the neighborhood for a long time - and I've been to Luke's sporadically over the years. No good reason I don't go regularly - the food is always exactly what I expect and the prices are fair. I seem to stick with the Italian beef - but the menu also covers hot dogs, hamburgers, subs and Italian Sausage. (I will have to try sausage, peppers and onions with red sauce at some point - one of my ultimate comfort foods- to see if they're as good as Guido's in Scottsdale.) The beef is juicy, shaved thin - and works perfectly with the giardinera and hoagie roll.   For those nights when I just need a mouthful of hot meat, Luke is my go-to guy! So happy I can satiate the craving right around the corner from home!

The Fantastic Mr. It's Complicated enjoys fishing. I know almost nothing about fishing. For the holidays, I decided to get him a gift certificate from Phoenix Fishing Supply.  I like to spend money locally instead of with big chains, and Phoenix Fishing happens to be within walking distance of my house. In addition to the gift certificate, I wanted to buy a single lure. You know, so I'd have something more than a piece of paper to hand him. As John K. mentioned in his review - there was the group of older guys (not employees) just hanging out near the front. The employees were all busy, so I was randomly looking at all the lures over several aisles. One of the older non employees offered his help - he spends so much time in this store he knows where everything is. He seemed to like my sense of humor. I told him I was looking for a single lure (nothing too expensive) for the boyfriend. Didn't want to spend a lot, as I have no clue if it will ever be used - the real plan is the gift certificate - the lure is just a cute little add on. He asked what my boyfriend fishes for. "BEER!" (sounded a lot better than, "hell if I know!") We settled on bass, and he guided me to that section. I felt like I was invading the boys club a bit - but not in an unwelcome sort of way. No rushing, no pressure - and if I do ever get into fishing, I have every confidence that everyone here (the staff AND the old boys club) would be happy to advise me and talk me through everything I need to know. I hope Fantastic Mr. It's Complicated invites me to join him when he's ready to use that certificate!

I have been to this store more times than I can count through the years. Sometimes for tools and supplies, sometimes for hobby related items (rocks for my gas grill, oil for my tiki torches, clamp lights as a cheap way to illuminate my backyard during parties, etc.) and sometimes to get keys made.  Every time, I've had good service from the staff who really knows their inventory. I really appreciate not having to deal with the parking lots and large crowds of the larger competitors. My time is valuable to me. And when I just need a few quick items, it is such a huge benefit to have Koller True Value right down the street!  Long live the independent hardware store!

I used to frequent this location - I think I'm pretty much done.  I guess now that the illegals who actually took pride in their work and had a spring in their step are gone, it truly is "bottom of the barrel" employment.  Look, I have tattoos. I date men with tattoos and piercings. Some of the people I love the most in this world have significant alterations. However - creepy dude with the craptastic jailhouse tattoos covering a good portion of his face as one of the first employees I interact with? No thanks.  Everyone looking miserable, as though they hate what they're doing and move at snail's pace to do it? No thanks.  And I've seen the sign for years that there's an upcharge for "large" vehicles. And when I had the Infinity QX4 for many years, I was never charged. (I figured it was for Suburbans and Expeditions and the like.) Well, I now have a Nissan Rogue. Which is smaller than my QX4 was. And l was charged for the oversize vehicle.  Mediocre at best wash done by creepy people who take no pride in the job they do that I get overcharged for?  No thanks! I'm done.

I've adored the downstairs bar and fireplace here for years - and had always been happy with the food and service. Somehow, the place fell out of rotation and off my radar for years. Until last week - when I was invited to join a small group for reverse happy hour. $5 wine, draft, marg.  $5 small plates. And all well worth it!  Between the four of us, we ordered: 2 orders of prime rib sliders 1 order carne adovada sliders 2 order shrimp piri piri 2 orders smoked salmon 1 order grilled oysters 1 order rokerij oysters  And it was WAY too much! Lots of food went home with us.  The shrimp piri piri with toast points was amazing - will definitely be ordering it again. The carne adovada sliders were the highlight of the night. GREAT flavor! The prime rib sliders were okay - but as others have pointed out - quite skimpy. The salmon was tasty - but we would have been fine with one order instead of 2. Grilled oysters were OK. I got spoiled with grilled oysters in New Orleans - these didn't come close. Rokerij oysters were fantastic and will be ordered again, for sure.  Happily - there's lots on the menu we didn't get to. Which means a great excuse to go back. Soon, and most likely often.  For me, the best part is the 10pm to close happy hour - even on Sunday. Not too many people going out for food and drink at 10 on a Sunday - gives me a guarantee of a spot at the bar and stellar service.  WIN!

I have only been here for Happy Hours - so this is only a review for HH offierings and experiences.  Two visits - the first was a party of five, the second a party of six.  Since Embassy provides Happy Hour for guests of the hotel (in another location, I am guessing), there was almost no one in the lobby bar, which is also the bar for Omaha Steakshouse.  Drinks:  I ordered a whiskey and coke ($5.00 well drinks), and the bartender asked if I'd prefer ginger ale.  While I adore a good whiskey and ginger, most bars don't have REAL ginger ale - so I rarely order it.  As a bartender, I know I only make suggestions to change a customers order if we are out of the requested item or if I feel it will make the drink that much better.  I didn't imagine they could be out of Coke - so I am guessing it was a suggestion for improvement and I agreed to it.  GOOD CALL!  Not only was real ginger ale used - the angel behind the bar muddled in some fresh ginger for me, too!  YUM! My companions had assortments of house wines, margaritas and beer.  Everyone was happy. The food offerings are all appetizer sized and perfect for sharing.  And, only $5.00 during Happy Hour! The wings are wings - nothing disappointing, but nothing to write home about. The Buffalo Chicken Sliders were tasty - but the bread was really the standout part of this dish, and I did appreciate the large chunks of bleu cheese in the dressing. The Hamburger Sliders are wonderful!  You can tell they are fresh grinding the meat from the quality beef they use.  The onions are sauteed to perfection and the buns are fresh, warm and the perfect golden brown.  Three to a plate - we had to order a second round of these! Pulled pork sliders were unremarkable, but okay.  (Like the wings.)  There was nothing wrong with them - and at $5 for three sliders, I have no right to expect an epiphany. I can't do our last dish justice.  It's homemade potato chip "nachos" with a bleu cheese sauce.  Honestly, despite having shared two orders of these on my first visit and one the second, I don't remember what else is on them but WOW - this is comfort food at its best and I can't wait to go back for more!  The room is not a typical hotel lobby.  There is a huge koi pond running throughout the lobby, and tall tropical trees.  I felt as if I was in a far cooler and more tropical area  - it was easy to forget I was in mid town Phoenix.  It seems this happy hour is still unknown - very few other people there for either visit.  But - I happen to adore the lack of loud music and ability to get top notch service - so that's not a complaint from me!  If they stretch happy hour to 7 instead of 6, I will gladly add on that elusive 5th star!

The people here are psychic! Really, I eaten here at least 10 times.  Each time, my food has been delivered within moments...way too fast to actually prepare it - but is always incredibly fresh.  So - they must sense I am coming, know what I am in the mood for (even if I don't know myself!) and start putting together the dish while I am still driving there.  I can't think of any other explanation!  I am not a lemon soup fan - but everyone I have taken there who orders it swears by it.  The lamb is perfectly cooked, the souvlaki is well seasoned, and the gyro meat should be the standard by which all gyro meat is graded.  As one who drinks a LOT of water or iced tea, I appreciate the huge cups they are served in - I don't have to wait to catch the server's attention for a refill.  In fact - I don't think I've ever finished my first cup here.  So glad to have this place as a dining option in my area - doesn't cost much more than fast food and is SO much tastier!

Two recent visits for reverse happy hour.  A dining buddy of mine gets off work at 9pm.  We've been trying various places in Central Phoenix for late food.   Zen 32 was chosen as a plan B a few weeks ago.  We were aiming for Postino on Central...but it was a 45 minute wait when I got there at 9.  Neither of us wanted to stand in the parking lot that long.  So I suggested Zen as an alternative.  I think it may be one of the frequent choices from here on out!  Both visits, Kara was our bartender/server.  Friendly, fast, outgoing, an absolute doll!   Reverse Happy Hour starts at 10 - when prices drop from "Holy High, Batman!"  to the perfect place to eat, drink and be whoever you care to be for around $20. Well and Draft for $3!  (Draft includes Stella - which makes my dining buddy a very happy camper.) Edamame and Miso for $2, Seaweed or Squid salads for $3.  Basic nigiri for $2-4, Some sashimi $5-6, Select rolls for $3.  Special rolls for $8. Where most places have long forgotten about gratis happy hour munchies - Zen 32 still provides them! On the first visit, hot offerings were crab puffs (okay, Krab puffs) and onion tempura.  A huge platter or California roll also out for the grazing...oops, I mean taking. Last night, the crab puffs had been replaced with spring rolls.  Two drinks, two rolls and a couple of trips to the buffet table...I was stuffed and my budget was not shattered.  Thank you Kara, and thank you Zen 32!  Reverse happy hour here is the perfect place for those of us who love sushi, but can't afford a real sushi dinner on a regular basis.

I've been in the process of moving, and have been Cox-blocked several times. (Was cut off at my old house too soon, having issues getting service at the new place.) I don't have a smart phone - so I really need internet access to coordinate the move and stay in touch with the outside world.  Denny's and Starbucks lost my interest very quickly. I needed wifi access, and I am more than happy to be a paying customer to get it. Oh, and I keep a late night schedule.  Enter Jerry's. Not far from the new house, open 24/7, and wifi access as requested.  Until this past week, I hadn't been into Jerry's in almost 20 years. I am so sorry it fell off my radar - this is a great place for a quick and affordable meal anytime day or night. And - quite the happy surprise - the food is pretty damn tasty!  Late night, visit #1 - I wasn't really hungry, but thought it would be tacky to just nurse an iced tea, so I was going to get a slice of dessert. (Offerings were apple, cherry, Boston Creme and Lemon Meringue pie, Chocolate or Lemon cake.) Then the waitress mentioned something about the awesome cinnamon roll with whipped butter, and that sounded perfect. AND IT WAS!  Late morning - visit #2 - Coffee and a Reuben sandwich with fries. Quite possibly the best diner Reuben a girl could ask for! YUM.  Lunch time - visit #3 - I brought a friend today. (Cox was supposed to connect me this morning, she was going to set up my home network. That didn't happen, so the least I could do was buy her lunch.) She had iced tea and a grilled club, I had iced coffee and a hamburger. I was super happy. Her only complaint was all the bacon seemed to be on one side of the sandwich - so she had to open it up to rebalance.  I am happy to have Jerry's nearby - and will most likely be in fairly often  - even when I can access the internet at home. Breakfast 24 hours a day? Yummy desserts? Friendly servers? Reasonable prices? Check, check, check and CHECK!

Absolutely adore the staff here!  I was hesitant to go on a holiday weekend - the parking lot here and huge crowds and children running amok are not a few of my favorite things.  But - I had a wild hair to transplant some of my houseplants. I needed potting soil, new containers and a few new plants.  There were several parking spots open right in front of the garden center. Score! And while I've always been impressed with the knowledge, friendliness and availability of the staff here, this last trip was awesome! I have to admit - I felt like one of the "pretty people!" The men in the garden center were flirting with me and basically tripping over each other to answer my questions and point me to everything I needed. It was a great ego boost - which I didn't see coming from a mile away.  That said - I got everything I went in for, spent less than I'd budgeted, my plants look great and happy and healthy, and I got to feel hot in the process! WIN!

*Happy Hour Review* (This is at the Mix Up Bar - and I will post there, too - but it seems many don't know it's separate from T. Cooks, so I am reviewing here.)  Three words: Duck Confit Poutine - rich, delicious, large portion. The name says it all - and my pictures do not do it any justice!  Three more words: Lobster Corn Dogs - small plate with only 3 pieces - but incredibly well prepared, delicious and hey - lobster for $5.00!?!  Three more words: Half price bourbon! Two incredibly well crafted and incredibly generous Manhattans later, I was feeling no pain!  One of the best parts of PHX is the under-appreciated happy hour deals at some of our best resorts. Especially this time of year - there are great values to be had, at incredible prices!  Here's the Mix Up current specials menu: Daily - happy hour 4-7; $5.00 cocktails, beer, wine and lite bites. Tuesdays - Pizza & Punch $5 flatbreads, $6 signature punch cocktail of the day: 4:00 p.m. - 12:00 a.m. Women & Whiskey Wednesdays - 1/2 price ladies bourbon night: 4:00 p.m. - 12:00 a.m. Bourbon & Burgers Thursdays - $8 burger, 1/2 price bourbons: 4:00 p.m. - 12:00 a.m.  .Can't wait to go back!

Come for the view, of course! The NYC cousins stayed at the Pointe for their very brief visit to Phoenix. Upon check in, they made reservations for 5 of us for Saturday night. Logistically, we were a pain in the ass. Five diners, one table. Between one and three courses ordered per person. NOT an easy job to pace that one! Mom had the lobster bisque and lobster entree. One cousin had the lobster bisque, a salad, and the special oyster app. Other cousin had a salad and scallop entree. Mom's husband just ordered the scallop entree. And I had the blood orange salad and Berkshire pork belly app. Service was impressive...plates were staggered in a way that it seemed we always had food in front of us, but never felt rushed. All the food was fresh and tasty, and beautifully presented.  Personally, I am thrilled with how many places pork belly is showing up these days. My hips are not happy, but my taste buds talk louder! :) Of course - the sun goes down, the Valley lights come on - and you remember why you're willing to pay insane prices. No matter how good the food is, no matter how good the service - you are paying for the view. And it is worth it! (That's not the double Maker's on the rocks talking!)

Review of the ER.  OMFG! Anyone with medical experience - here's the $25,000 question. Patient - 64 overweight female complaining of extreme nausea and vomiting(almost 24 hours) and a few days unable to have a movement.  Not very alert, BEGGING for water or ice chips.  You do NO CBC.  No blood or urine test of any sort.  WHY????  A blood test likely would have shown blood sugar well into the mid 400's.  A urine test would have shown ketones through the roof.  Either of these simple tests would have likely gotten her admitted on the spot to get her newly discovered diabetes under control. Instead - you do an X-ray to make sure there's no obstruction, give her some prescription anti-nausea drugs and laxatives and send her on her merry way.  Well, her husaband brought her back to the ER - while on vacation in Washington State just 3 days later.  By then her blood sugar was well over 500, her ketone level was atrocious, her pH was dangerously low. Then she got to spend 2 days in ICU.  Intensive Fucking Care!  In a state far from home.  For what it's worth - when the hospital in WA recieved the records from PV and saw no blood or urine test was taken, they couldn't understand WHY.  If nothing else, a CBC to check for infection would have been one of the first things they did.  (And, in fact, WAS one of the first things they did.)  Hours in your ER for nothing.  Minutes in Washington, and she's in the ICU. She should not have been released from your ER - she should have been admitted.  And maybe with the extra 72 hours to work with, ICU could have been avoided.  And I'd be able to see my mom in the hospital.  She's out now - and on her way home.  No thanks to you.

A friend wanted to come here for his birthday. I tried to talk him out of it - but it *was* his birthday, and sometimes, it can be fun to be a hokey tourist in your own town. We had no delusions about what we were in for. This is not a great restaurant. This is a cheesy, cowboy themed resort restaurant that caters to tourists and happens to have a great view. To make sure we did it right, we changed clothes prior to going - to ensure we could enjoy the slide down into the dining room. (Without offending parents of innocent children or risking chafing to dangly bits.) We started with a cocktail in the bar while waiting for a table. Did we each order the sickly-sweet tropical nonsense in a glass cowboy boot and served while on fire? You bet your ass we did! (Now, to figure out what to do with my glass cowboy boot souvenir...) There's sawdust on the floor, and the décor screams "Disney Design Company." All the clichés of an old West steakhouse/saloon are represented - down to the raised stage where the live band performs all the safe, upbeat Country standards. When we were seated, a basket of fry bread was delivered with both regular and honey butter. Do you know what's wrong with fried bread and butter? Not a damn thing! This is not a menu for the health conscious. And based on the prices, there's no possible way it's great quality meat. ($24.95 for a bone in rib-eye - with salad, carrots and corn??) The portions are ginormous, there's a decent variety of options, and rotating monthly specials. I had discreetly mentioned it was my friend's birthday (because I put the "B" in subtle!) I wasn't down with spending the extra money for the birthday package...and really, who needs an éclair sundae that must weigh in at five pounds - so we were both pleased when the waiter brought my friend cotton candy with a candle. We went in with expectations of touristy cheesiness and set the bar very, very low for dinner service. And we were both pleasantly surprised. The food was completely satisfactory. The service was completely decent. And when it came down to it - we had an absolute blast. Rustler's Rooste is not a great restaurant by any stretch, and it's not trying to be - but it can be great fun if you let it...and that makes it a great place!

Who woulda thunk it - ME spending time at a shooting range?!?! But, now I get to call myself a gun totin' liberal. ;)  I can't really compare the Scottsdale Gun Club to other indoor ranges in town, as I haven't been anywhere else.  After three visits - the staff is courteous and professional, the retail display space is clean and  well organized, and there's a large selection of courses offered. Plenty of firearms for rent, as well.  I have someone teaching me the basics of shooting - and SGC has been a perfect location for that - plenty of space and plenty of people on hand to answer all the questions I have!

My buddy Mike and I went here the night before Thanksgiving.  We had some last minute food shopping to do, then pick his girlfriend up at the airport. I have eaten at the Red Devil on McDowell...while it doesn't WOW me, it has always been decent food at decent prices in large quantity - so I was willing to hit up this location. Ahhh...the smell of cleaning fluids.  Sure, it's nice to know they keep the place clean - but when I walk into a restaurant, I want to smell FOOD, not anti bacterial disinfectant! I had the chicken marsala, Mike ordered the chicken lasagne.  The salads were predictable iceberg, two slices red onion, 2 canned black olives.  Nothing wrong with them...just lackluster and boring.  Same with the bread.  Sure, it was fresh and warm.  But lackluster and without remarkable flavor or texture. My chicken had been tenderized beyond identification.  (Think the inside of a McDonalds chicken nugget.)  The marsala sauce was bland as could be and the mushrooms were straight out of a can.  I was quite hungry, and made it about halfway through before the lack of decent flavor told me to stop.  The side of pasta with red sauce was fine.  If I ever have to go back, maybe I'll just stick with that. Mike said his chicken lasagne was OK...but within a half hour of leaving the restaurant, he recinded that. When we spoke Thanksgiving morning, he sounded to be in bad shape.  I figured it was because we picked up his girlfriend at the aiport at about 10, so he was up all night "reacquainting" with her.  I was half right.  He WAS up all night...but it was doubled over in pain in the restroom. So - I am the lucky one here.  Completely disappointed in my meal - but I didn't get physically ill.   If that's the best thing I can come up with to say about the place - well, you know I won't be back!

Ted's has been around forever for two reasons. Great quality and fair price.  I coworker had posted photos earlier this year, spending hours in line to take her daughter to Pink's Hot Dogs in LA. I asked why wait in an insanely long line for Pink's, when she can get better product at Ted's. She'd never heard of Ted's, so I made it a mission to take her for lunch. It was a super hungry day for me - I had an Italian Sausage with a side of a regular dog. The coworker had a jumbo dog, and we shared onion rings. The onion rings were amazing. All onion rings should be Ted's onion rings! Thin sliced, crispy breading - clearly made fresh to order.  My Italian Sausage was perfectly seasoned and had just the right level of spice. Topped with deli mustard and cooked peppers and onions. I could not have asked for a more delicious lunch. In hindsight, I should have eaten the regular dog first. It was tasty. Incredibly enjoyable. But with the flavor of the Italian Sausage still on my tongue, it was a little on the boring side. Truly, nothing wrong with it at all - and had I reversed the order of consumption, I would have loved both equally. My fault, not Ted's! If I had to come up with a con, it would be the location. Nowhere close to my house or stomping grounds, and too far from my office to make it a regular stop. Tempe people are soooo lucky!

Weekend with my sister, who was visiting from NYC. We spent the weekend in Sedona/Jerome and were making dinner for a small group of us Sunday evening. Dessert was the easiest part of dinner to figure out - stop at Rock Springs and get pie!   We picked up the Jack Daniels Pecan pie and the Peach pie. We were curious about the Tennessee Lemon - but the staff we spoke with were clearly not lemon fans and two of the three made "bitter lemon" face and mentioned it was really tart. Sadly, without taking the extra time to sit and try a slice, they didn't make samples available - so we did the peach instead. (Lemon, you're on my list!)  Both pies were fantastic (as always) and my sister got a huge kick out of the slice of Americana that is Rock Springs Cafe.  Yes, they do more than pie. And all the food is fresh, tasty and good portions at fair prices. While we didn't eat on this pass through, I've eaten there several times in years past, and each experience has met or exceeded expectations.  But really, it's all about the pie! And grabbing one on my way back down the mountain from various adventures north is generally on my list of things to do. Definitely worth the stop!

I have spent more hours here than I can count - and even if there were no traveling special exhibits, I'd find something new every time.  Granted - I am that person who spent over an hour staring at a single Kandinsky a few years back. I do have real appreciation for the special exhibitions.  I also appreciate the sculptures in the courtyard, the miniatures, the Asian collection and several other pieces from the permanent collection. One of the advantages of being in Phoenix is the accessible parking (happily also along the light rail) and the reasonable entrance fees. (To the people who gripe about the museum and theater prices in Phoenix - go to NYC, San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, etc. We have bargains in comparison!  Having lived in PHX for as long as I have, I've watched the museum grow. Section by section. I appreciate the modern lines and use of light throughout - and given how many additions have been built on over the years, it's still architecturally coherent.  The cafe is a nice pit stop, and the gift shop is well stocked and has something for everyone. There are great events through the course of the year - and annual membership is well worth the price for how much you get in exchange!

Damn Good Burger! (I appreciate the load your own toppings and the variety of burger sizes and cheese options)  Super onion rings! (SUPER ONION RINGS!)  Limited but fresh salad bar. (Iceberg, onion, bell pepper, cucumber, broccoli, shrooms, shredded cheese, bacon bits, hard boiled egg, croutons. Can grab tomato and hot peppers from the burger topping side.)  Great prices! (My 1/3lb really good burger with no cheese was $5.29. Choice of white, wheat, onion bun.)  Crappy draft/draught selection - which is the hold back from the 5th star. (I prefer something a bit more...ummm, well, more beer like than Michelob's Amber Bock.)  I will be back!  Damn, that was a good burger!

How have I lived in this town for over 20 years now - many of those years in the central Phoenix area - and *not* ever heard of this place? My companion, the Fantastic Mr. "It's Complicated", was shocked I'd never heard of it, and brought me in for lunch yesterday.  He was so right! It is a gem of a sammy shop!  I ordered the Sicilian sub - great balance of flavor and texture, and everything was super fresh. Fantastic Mr. "It's Complicated" went for the Super Sicilian - basically the same, but with the addition of ham. The toasted sesame bread was amazing - I will have to see if they will just sell loaves of that. The meats were all good and the veggies were fresh. The dressing was tasty and perfect amount.   Could not have been happier with the food.  The place is old and small and just the way I like my neighborhood places to be. More money is spent on food than updating decor - and I appreciate that. It's clean, but small. I can see how the lunch rush could be quite chaotic in here - luckily I wasn't there until about 2:30 - it was pretty close to empty.   The other reviews about the parking lot were right - if it were lunch rush, it would be insane!  Granted - it's technically possible my five star review is influenced by the new man, everything in the world seems just a little better when I am with him, so I will have to go back when the happy cloud wears off or maybe even without him. You know, in the name of scientific research.  But I have a feeling these will still be great sandwiches!

Knowledgeable and helpful staff. HUGE facility with everything you could want by way of aquarium (saltwater and/or freshwater) equipment and supplies, as well as a huge selection of fish. Also a decent reptile section. The Fantastic Mr. It's Complicated has a couple huge aquariums. The freshwater is set up and has had some fishes for years. The saltwater is notably bigger - and not currently set up. He wanted some new fishes and some plants for the freshwater tank, and this is his store of choice. He chose plants and a couple Baal sharks, and suggested I pick a fish I liked. I don't know much about fish, but really liked the shape and grace of the black angelfish, so he got one for me. Looking forward to years of fun and lots of leaning about aquariums - and happy to know Ocean Floor is nearby for all the fishy needs we may have.

Ah, the quintessential gringo Mexican restaurant! (And that's a good thing!)  Nothing here moves beyond stereotype, and what we'd expect to find in a good quality, long standing Mexican restaurant in this town. The food, the decor, the menus - all of it is like the Central Casting version of a Mexican Restaurant.  Ice cold Negra Modelo and a HUGE platter of nachos. PERFECT afternoon snack!  You bet tus naglas I will be back!

HOW does this place have an average of 3 stars???  I am giving one star because there's no way to go any lower!  Eeek!  I have lived in PHX for more or less 25 years.  It's been at least 22 since I've been into a Big Apple and now I remember why.  There was a large group of us - and we came in at staggered times.  I know this is a hassle for the server - as she got the orders technically correct and all the seperate checks were accurate, I will say our server, Juanita, was completely acceptable.  I would say I prefer my servers to have all their key teeth - but that's just snobby and irrelevant to the service, so I'll let it go.  Food - the value here would be great for a steakhouse - if it was good.  The zucchini app for the table was A-OK.  It's a mountain of sliced breaded and fried zuc - and it was fried right and served piping hot. The salad dressings threw me off a bit.  No regular Italian or Balsamic Vinaigrette - but a RASPBERRY vinaigrette?  At a value steakhouse?  The French dressing is a CINNAMON French.  Not bad...but I'm not a fan of dessert flavored iceberg lettuce. :) For entree, I chose the ribeye with baked potato.  The potato was fine.  I wish I could say the same about the meat - but I still can't figure out how they managed to make a rib eye tasteless.  It was on the rare side of the medium rare I ordered - and with that much fat, it should have been delicious. But, no.  Not a morsel of flavor to be found in the whole 12oz serving.  (Half was consumed for next day lunch - the extra aging didn't help. :)  In fact - my dog wasn't even impressed.) Nothing wrong with the corn on the cob - as long as it's cooked I think that's hard to mess up.   I am guessing the baked beans were ok  - some people must like the cloyingly sweet 3 parts brown sugar to 1 part bean recipe.  Personally, I am not a fan, so I didn't enjoy them.  The decor is cowboy steakhouse.  Very similar to any other cowboy steakhouse.  (LoneStar, Texaz Roadhouse, etc.)  But - that brings us to the restroom.    Parents - shield your children!  Nature called, so I went to check out the restrooms.  I understand sometimes old plumbing allows odors to linger that newer buildings don't have issues with.  As I walked the hall toward the restroom doors, the outhouse smell grew with each step. Once in the ladies' room, the smell was almost noxious.  I know it's clean and germ free in there - as the smell of bleach competed with the sewage smell.  As I became nauseated, I pondered if I'd be able to hold my breath until I was finished, put back together and hand washed.  I even considered skipping washing my hands, as we did have wet naps on the table.  Anything to get out of there faster!  (I did wash my hands, but didn't take time to dry them, and re-zipped and buttoned my jeans as I was walkling back the outhouse stinking hallway back to the dining room.)  I've heard it mentioned that everyone has thier own personal hell - not necessarily the fire and brimstone depictions.  If this is true, I will do my best to be a good girl the rest of my life - I am afraid this place with it's stink restrooms, tasteless meat and strange "mordern" salad dressings (strange for an old fashioned cowboy steakshouse, anyway) may very well be the hell I'd be sent to if my  good deeds didn't add up at final judgement.

Beware - Food Baby On Board! Why do I take an All You Can Eat menu as a personal challenge?  I went yesterday with 2 friends for late lunch/early dinner.  We had planned on Ichi Ban at Central and Thomas for the proximity to our houses, but they didn't open till 5.  They'd been to Sushi Q before, and suggested it.  They did not tell me about the AYCE menu!  $25.95  with a decent selection of apps, nigiri and rolls.    I wasn't doing to do it.  I was going to order from the regular menu.  I chose 3 rolls (soft shell crab, tootsie and I don't remember the third) - when I figured the price, I realized I was just a couple bucks shy of the AYCE price.  So, if I ordered just one more item, it would be more cost effective to go the AYCE route. What was I thinking?  Three rolls is PLENTY!  Ordered - soft shell crab, tootsie and summer (spicy crab roll with spicy tuna on top) to start - with the plan of doing a round 2. Ate - all of mine, plus helped one of my companions finish her summer roll.  It was TOO MUCH FOOD!  For my appetite, the AYCE is a waste of money.  I should have done a miso soup and two rolls - that would have been perfect for me.  Dining companion M should have also ordered from the regular menu.  We would have been fine if we didn't have to help her.  Dining companion D made the AYCE well worth it - he was the only one it ended up making sense for.  All rolls were fresh and tasty.  D cannot have any seeds, the sushi chef was happy to make adjustments accordingly.  Oh, and M hates avocado - he was also happy to oblige her.  Good to know they will make substitutions, even on an AYCE menu!    The lady next to me had a seaweed salad that looked awesome and very fresh - and her salmon sashimi was gorgeous!  Clean place, friendly staff, fair prices.  I love strip mall sushi!  Places like this, you know you're paying for the food - not the address and state of the art decor.  (Why I don't go to the "pretty" places much - I'd rather spend my cash on the food than the "see and be seen" factor!)  It wasn't the most amazing sushi in town, but there was nothing wrong with it, and I will gladly be back!

This place is away from my normal stomping grounds - but the vet I had been going to was losing it on the business/customer service end of things - so I wanted to find somewhere my dog and I were, well - wanted.  Mid-City came very highly recommended - and I was sure it was a better place for me (if not my pooh) with the first phone call.  Friendly, professional and great flexible hours to take care of those of us who work a full time day job.  I am more than willing to take time off if my dog is sick and needs help - but for annual exams and scheduled blood tests, being able to go there in the evening or on a Saturday makes way more sense to me.  Done!  We saw Dr. Hull - who has been a vet since the Dead Sea was only Sick. :)  He looks like Santa Claus and had my (since deceased) husky calm and well behaved for his exam in no time.  When the husky got older and sicker, Dr. Hull had an almost magical link to him - and I knew he was in good hands.  I also appreciated that Dr. Hull is a big believer in quality of life over quantity of life.  He's as good with people as he is with animals - and I completely trust him with my life as well as my fur-kids.  After my husky passed, I adopted a new fur-kid, Layla the Lab mix.  She's had check-ups with both Dr. Hull and Dr. Tauer.  I have always been treated well (as have the pooches) by both Dr.'s, all the tecs and the receptionists.  Prices are fair, and I've never felt something has been suggested by way of testing, prescriptions or other costs that were not absolutely needed.  Definitely a great facility!

I'm not rich, and I'm not lazy.  Sometimes my work schedule gets so hectic for long stretches, something has to give. Usually, that something is housework.  In the hustle and bustle of life, there just aren't enough hours in the day or days in the week to take care of everything.  Which is why I contacted Maids of Honor. Once a month, Maids of Honor comes in and cleans my house. The first visit was a long one - two ladies doing a full Spring cleaning on everything. Each subsequent visit, there's always a full deep clean on the kitchen and bathroom, a Spring clean on one rotating area (in my case, it's bedroom, office, dining room and living room), and a basic clean on the rest of the house.  My house is always clean and fresh when they're done. I have yet to find an area that I want to ask them to re-do, or focus more on the next visit. They're also GREAT with my dog! In addition to being friendly with her - and patient when she gets underfoot - they're very careful when opening the door to go outside, making sure she doesn't run out. Prices are definitely fair - there are companies out there who offer cleaning for less. I tried some of those. Once. There are also plenty of companies who charge notably more - I haven't tried any of those - as Maids of Honor has done such a great job I feel no need to contact anyone else.   The customer service from the office has been a little hit and miss. On one occasion, I was given an arrival time for mid-day, when I got the confirmation call 2 days before the visit. The schedule for the day changed, but I wasn't informed. I ended up being closer to the end of the day. That was not a huge issue for me - I was working from home that day, and would have been there anyway. I just felt I should have received a call, instead of me having to call them to make sure everything was ok. On a different occasion, I called the office three days before my scheduled visit to explain I would not be home at the time of service, and where I was leaving the key so they could get in. The next day, when getting the confirmation call, I again mentioned I would not be home, and where the key would be left.  On the day of service, the team lead called me, asking if I was home, as my car wasn't there. Luckily, I was between meetings and able to take her call. No one at the office ever relayed my TWO messages of where the key would be. On the flip side - every interaction with Cathy, the owner, has been positive - and she did personally call me to apologize for the first instance above. I've never had any issues with billing, and everyone is friendly.  Far and away - the most important part of the experience is the people in my house and the quality of work they do.  The fact I was comfortable leaving a key to get in when I wasn't home speaks to the level of trust they've earned.  Maids of Honor is definitely a solid company that does a really good job!

Not much I can say that hasn't been covered.  Comfortable upscale - Western decor, well laid out room, and you can count on consistently great service, food and libation.  Definitely dig the happy hour - what a great place to start!  Also dig how perfect the Manhattan was.  It's shocking how many places screw up such a classic (and truly simple) cocktail.    Some friends were in from out of town and really wanted to go here for dinner. Kenneth, our server was flawless!  (And I am not just saying that becuase I recognized him from a restaurant he used to work at and we have friends in common.)  Within our group, we had the pork green chile, fried chicken, salmon, ribs and lamb.  A couple sides of green chile mac, a side of asparagus, and a couple to-go boxes at the end!  All the dishes were fresh, flavorful, and plated beautifully.  Will definitely be back - and I have plans on working my way through the happy hour drink list.  What a wonderful goal! :)

MMMMMMMM, sausage, peppers and onions!  Finally made it here for lunch - had been planning on checking the place out for a long time, but rarely get to that part of town.  Fantastic Mr. It's Complicated recently bought a car at one of the McDowell dealerships, and was bringing it in for service. I met him there, and we went off in search of food. Happily, he was in the mood for a sandwich (and a beer!), so he was agreeable to checking out Defalco's.  I loved my sandwich! Fresh, chewy bread, flavorful sausage and red sauce - it was a comfort food happy place for me! My dining partner was not quite as thrilled - while the flavor of his cheesesteak was spot on, we both felt the texture was too mushy.  We did have fun checking out the grocery products - and have some inspirations for meals to make together in the future. So we'll be back - for shopping and a sandwich!

I am ignorant when it comes to quality audio equipment - all I knew walking in was I needed a record player, and I wanted it to be good enough to compliment my Bang & Olufsen components.  Glen showed me a selection of turntables and we decided on one that would be a great fit for my needs. We spent hours talking, and I no point did I feel he was pressuring me to spend more or buy more than I needed. The shop has some amazing inventory - and as I need pieces, I will definitely be going back.  Friendly, professional and NO pressure. It was a real pleasure doing business with these guys, and I may just bring in some records on a slow Saturday to listen in the room with the killer acoustics and equipment that I definitely can appreciate, but not afford. WOW.

What a terrible dump! And why haven't I been here before???  I skipped out on the mardi gras beads on my way in - have more than enough at home. I did, however, accept the coupon for the buck off the BIG daiquiri. BIG. As in 48 ounces!  I wasn't driving, was with a group of people I have no qualms trusting my life with and face it - sometimes 48 ounces of liquid "I don't give a shit" are just what ya need! And when I decided to pay homage to the "I don't give a shit" days of NOLA is when I started having a blast.  That - and the look on a friend's face when he cashed about $300 from the slot he was playing and it paid in nickels! Got used used to the paper ticket - having any coin drop is a throwback...but NICKELS? Wasn't even a nickel slot...so the look on his face was classic.  Yay - I will totally be back!

A few years ago, I let one tiny misstep tarnish my impression of Durant's. Fortunately, I went back. A few times. A dinner with a dear friend - service was impeccable, the food was fantastic, and the timing was right - I finally got one of the dessert chips I've been wanting for so many years. I've also been back for lunch - and everything was spot on - and I got to take advantage of my chip!  I don't know that it's worth reviewing the food - I don't know they're capable of less than stellar. The cocktails are strong, the wine list is great - and the classic red steakhouse decor never actually goes out of style.  I love this place!

Chinese comfort food at it's best!  There's nothing on the menu here to make you rethink American style Chinese food.  Nothing to say WOW about...nothing to make you call your friends and brag about the amazing culinary find.  This is my favorite place when I just want comfortable, relaxed, I know just what I am gonna get Chinese food.  The place is always clean.  Service always prompt and friendly, food always fresh, tasty and well portioned.  I am lucky to have two such restaurants in my area, and I alternate between the two.  But Golden Phoenix stays closer to my heart - it just feels more like "home."

A dear friend lives in the Tuke and had a groupon for Sushi Eye. My good fortune - his girlfriend is on a super restrictive diet, and would be unable to eat anything yummy until after the groupon expired. So I got a lunch invite!  We each had a beer and seaweed salad to start out. (Reminds me of our old standing Monday night meet-up at Zen 32 for reverse happy hour...but I digress.)  He did the ordering - sadly, I don't remember specifically everything that we had -  but, in a way, it doesn't matter for this review. The fish was all spot on in quality and freshness. The rolls were well crafted, well presented and delicious. Service was a bit spotty at first  - but once we got the food, we had nothing at all to complain about.  I don't know there's anything here that would make me call Sushi Eye the best in town. I don't even know that it hits my overall top 5. But - it is good, and  quite enjoyed my post-meal sushi coma. Plus, it's locally owned *and* ethnic in the Tuke - so that's worth 2 starts right there! :)

We came for the pan fried chicken. Which was the only entree we didn't end up loving. Go figure!  We started with a cocktail on the patio side of the bar, and moved to a table inside when it was ready.  Appearing on our table (we all shared) was the kale and quinoa salad, the cheeseburger on leaf instead of bun, ribeye, pan fried chicken, grilled salmon and the baked mac n' cheese.   Each dish was well presented, good portions and solid flavor. The kale salad and cheeseburger were AMAZING. The ribeye, salmon and mac n' cheese were all very good, and the pan fried chicken was OK. Given the way the four of us felt about all the other items, the chicken was just not up to par.  We finished with really good coffee and a shared dessert of key lime pie with pecan graham cracker crust and the most amazing strawberry gelato any of us have ever tasted. As an added bonus, it's vegan! (A bonus for me, as I have some dairy issues - knowing it was vegan I didn't have to worry about the risk!)  Service was flawless, the room was welcoming and comfortable, and I look forward to many more meals here!

This rating is based on catered food - I haven't been into the restaurant since it was Bobby McGee's - and maybe the food is better when eaten there.  Someone from work had Bobby Q's cater in last week.  One star is for getting the order and all the extras right.  Plenty of buns, plates, silverware and wetnaps to go around.  The other star is for the cornbread muffins - they were pretty damn good.  Meats were pork, chicken, brisket and ribs.  In the interest of this review, I decided to sample all.  The texture of the meats was the only way I could tell the difference.  The brisket was sliced, the ribs were with bones, the pork was all gristle and the chicken was - um, the other one.  Really, flavorwise, they were identical.  How on earth did they manage to pull that off?  We had large containers of the regular and spicy bbq sauce.  Good thing I loaded up on the spicy.  It wasn't.  At all.  But it actually had some flavor - so I cringe to think what the regular would have tasted like.    I enjoyed the texture of the cole slaw - it had a much finer shred than most.  Too bad it was tasteless.  If the slaw tasted as good as it looked and felt in my mouth, I'd add an extra star and probably go there just to make a meal of the coleslaw and cornbread.  Lacking space on my plate - I skipped the mac n cheese and beans.  Based on reviews from people here I know and trust - I am guessing it's way better in the restaurant - but as far as catered bbq goes, the best thing I can really say is it was a free meal for me - so I guess I got fair value for the price I paid.  Meh, indeed.

After the review (below) of my catered dinner from Bobby Q, I received this email:  I would like to apologize for your catering experience. We pride ourselves on our food and take negative reviews very serious. I've shared your review with the owner and the kitchen manager. I would like to invite you and your family in for dinner on us. We would like to prove to you the quality of our food. Just call me directly and make a reservation. Again, we apologize for your experience.  Jason Gilliland Restaurant Manager  I wasn't sure how I felt about accepting a free meal - that was really not a goal when I wrote the first review.  In fact, my first thought was why should I waste my time on doing this food again?  But - I was very impressed with Jason's email and decided to give it a shot. He wasn't asking me to change my review - he was aksing for a chance to prove how good they can be.  If it was terrible, he was running the risk of me updating with an even worse review.  My roommates and I all had the day off today, and around lunch time we were discussing food.  We were definitely in the mood for BBQ.  I called Jason, and he immediately set up our reservations for dinner tonight.  Complete breakdown on the experience -  The room was nice!  Actually, the place was MUCH nicer than I expected a BBQ place to be - but not so stuffy we felt underdressed. Our server was Ashleigh - she was 100% on point tonight!  From her brief rundown on what Bobby Q is and what to expect, to menu descriptions, keeping our water and iced tea full, checking back at perfect intervals and - my *wow* moment of service - when she dropped off the moist towelettes, the packages were pre-opened!  Sounds silly - but when you have BBQ greasy fingers, those packages can be a bitch! The food - holy mother of wow - this was the same place as the last review?  The food was made with the same recipes in the same kitchen??  The only thing that tipped me off was the cornbread - still over the top amazing! The three of us split the Cajun shrimp appetizer with garlic toast points.  While it did not have the level of kick I've come to expect from BBQ shrimp, the flavor was incredible.  Adding in the rosemary was a dash of genius, and the 6 shrimp were perfectly cooked.  This is a recipe I'd LOVE to have! Wedge salad - HUGE!  In addition to the iceberg, tomato, bacon and bleu cheese, there was bacon.  Not just the baon bits - but big chunks of Meat Candy.  The blue was one of the richest and creamiest I've tasted. For meats, we had brisket, rib eye, St. Louis style ribs and beef ribs.  Across the board, each was fantastic!  Just as the AKC is looking for the "ideal" of each dog - the meats we ate tonight could be held as the ideal against which all other meats were judged.  Each of the four was a perfect example of what that meat can become, when prepared perfectly! The cole slaw does have good flavor - and I adore the fine shred they use.  So now it's two thumbs up for flavor and texture.  The mac and cheese was incredibly rich and creamy.  The baked potatoes - well, they are well prepared baked potatoes.  Either they're done right or wrong - not a lot of middle ground - and these were right. I aldo enjoyed the featured beer - the Bobby Q Amber - which is brewed by Sonoran - so that was double local goodness. I'd love to be able to review the peach cobbler - but we had already given up and filled boxes with leftovers to be tomorrow's lunch.  None of us had room for another bite. Then Ashleigh brought the donuts.  Damn donuts!  Perfect, warm and soft, cinnamon sugar fried rings of perfect!  I knew I was full.  I knew I shouldn't eat anything more.  And I am so lucky she only brought one for each of us...otherwise I'd still be there eating more and more and more of them! Fantastic dinner - all of us were incredibly happy from beginning to end with the entire experience. Thank you Jason - if you wouldn't have reached out, I never would have known what I was missing! We will definitely be back!

We went for the buffet, but my highlight was the men's room!  The buffet is probably the best value left in Vegas. Sure, it's not the incredible plating and presentation as some of the newer, bigger buffets - but it's CHEAP. Like, you can get just one plate of food and not feel like you've wasted money cheap!  Nice selection of flavors from around the world, all of it pretty tasty. Dollar for dollar, truly the best food value I've seen.  The architecture and detail work throughout the casino is spectacular! Love the wood, pressed tin plates, marble, chandeliers, etc. It really feels like a converted historic train station and I could spend hours just looking at the walls and ceilings. Absolutely gorgeous!  Then - the men's room. I don't know if it's supposed to be a secret. I haven't seen it come up in many tour books. But where else will I get to have an up close and personal view of large pieces of the Berlin Wall, just for the $5 tip we gave the security guard to clear out the men's room so we gals could walk in and see?  Absolutely asinine to have it in the men's room - it really should be on display where everyone can appreciate it - without having to make poor drunks stand in the hallway doing the pee-pee dance while waiting! But - the adventure in making it happen and just how random it is, well, that's something I find a little endearing.  Hope each time I go back it's with new people, so I can have the excuse of staring at the wall behind the urinals. That's a sentence I never imagined would cross my mind, but it's so true!  I will totally be back!

I've been to Harley's several times through the years. Most recently about 2 weeks ago with Mr. It's Complicated. For what (I didn't know then) would be our last meal out together.  We sat at the bar, enjoyed the fresh bread and herbs with olive oil. I had the amazing pasta dish with penne, sausage, peppers, onions, chile flakes and red sauce. Complicated ordered a bit off menu and enjoyed a penne alfredo with chicken. We each had a glass of wine - and realized this should be a place we frequent.  That's not going to happen - but I will be back. Often, and with family and friends.  Ordering off menu was dealt with in a very professional and gracious manner - and though it's not on the menu, they happily sub spaghetti squash for pasta - PERFECT news for my GF and Atkins friends!

Hello, Phoenix history! This was the second location of the Cork N' Cleaver chain. Back when there was a Cork N' Cleaver chain. And not much has changed since.  In my mid 20's I lived around the corner and was in quite often. Never had a bad meal. Granted - I never had a GREAT meal - but it was never bad.  I moved away - then I moved back. While I am certainly not a regular - some of the specials are just too hard to pass by. Monday is CenPho is cheap burger night. $4 for burger and fries at Feeney's and Maizies, $5 at Vig and Vig Uptown. My mom's husband is not a big fan of Maizie's decor, so we have been frequenting Vig Uptown. I talked them into Feeney's last week - and it was a great trip down memory lane. Each of us went for the $4 burger special, and we each elected to add on the salad bar for $2.50.  Nothing exceptional - it was a standard, good quality burger. Nothing flashy or showy - nothing you wouldn't have seen when they opened this location in 1965. And it still works. Well.   Specials other nights of the week include fish & chips, liver and onions, fried chicken, salisbury steak and half rack of ribs - all for $10 each, and all including the salad bar.  Tough to beat that!  In this town, it's not easy to keep an independently owned restaurant open. And keeping one open almost 50 years? Well, I think we can all count on one hand how many places have made that happen.   The food is solid, if not spectacular, the service is always decent, the prices are fair and the portions are good - glad to have Feeney's in my area - it makes me feel like I am part of this town's history - and lets me step back in time a bit.  The advantage of not having updated is when you get inside, it's easy to forget the outside world. You're in a little time warp with a full bar, well executed food and none of the worries of the real world of 2012.

This is the closest theater to my house - and I am digging matinee pricing. I work second shift, so the lunchtime showing of movie plus lunch at the same time makes weekday movies a possibility for me.  Is the food fantastic?  Not really.  But it's predictable and tasty - the servers I have dealt with are all friendly and well trained not to impede with the movie.  Glad it's here - and as long as the quality and cleanliness keeps up, I'll be a regular!

Let's see - the last and only other review for this branch was a little over two years ago, and was two stars. Which for me, is too many!  While at some point, I am sure I will write a story with my experiences in sorting out the financial cluster-fuck my mom created and didn't leave a master map for - it will probably need to be marketed as fiction, but still quite entertaining as long as it didn't happen to your life...today is not that day - so I will skip some of the more sordid details for now.  For Yelp review purposes - FIVE visits to the bank, in person, dealing face to face with people, to continually be given partial information, irrelevant information, and negligently incorrect information.  All for a halfhearted apology and a bottle of water. Lovely.  Here's the thing, Wells - my mother had accounts with you for many years. My stepfather has an account with you. Had I been treated well, had I been treated with any value and respect and even a modicum of interest, I may have started an account with you. I would have been a relatively easy sell. However, not only was I not convinced I'd get stellar service if I were your customer, I was so disgusted by the horrible communication and mediocre at best service that there's no way I'd ever consider an account with you. You effectively drove away my business before you even got it.   Granted - I am not the Sultan of Brunei or any relation to Bill Gates - the lack of my business won't effect your bottom line in any notable way. You'll never feel the pinch of having driven a way a potential small time checking and savings account customer. But if you keep it up, there may be enough of us that is DOES make a difference. Try to remember that.

I've had a great experience with this location many times over the years. For charity events I work with, I have rented both trucks and cargo trailers. For my own moves, I have rented cargo and utility trailers. I've also purchased wares from the front office. (Boxes, tape, tie downs, etc.)  Prices are fair, service is quick and friendly, employees are professional and knowledgeable.

I'm feeling generous tonight, and am willing to splurge on the second star.  Mom was in the hospital across the street, and really wanted some hot and sour soup and chicken chow mein. Went across the street with my roommate in tow, and we decided to have a drink while waiting for our food to go.  Our order -  Small hot and sour soup Canton sampler (ribs, fried shrimp, egg rolls, crab puffs) Pork dumplings Chicken chow mein 2 hard alcohol drinks  Well - the drinks were right - and poured on the heavy side. That accounts for one of the stars. The bartender was a sweetheart, which is the other star.  I can't report on the hot and sour soup. Mom had about two spoons of it, said it was fine, but didn't want anything more. And insisted I take the chicken entree home with me, she had no appetite at all. The sampler. Mostly tasteless and unremarkable. Except the crab puffs. They were memorable because they were so incredibly sweet I couldn't even finish one. The filling seemed to have as much powdered sugar as cream cheese. Not something I'm used to, and not pleasant. Pork dumplings I can't comment on - as we got BBQ sliced pork instead. Sigh. Chicken chow mein - I know it's supposed to be a mild (bland) dish - but they even managed to get the flavor out of the veggies! And something was missing. The chow mein noodles! Seriously? A noodle dish and you forget to include the damn noodles? I had to specifically ask for a plastic spoon for the soup and chopsticks. Too bad I didn't check the packages - would have also asked for hot mustard, sweet and sour sauce, and maybe a suggestion for a decent Chinese restaurant next time I am in the area.  When the Applebee's in the same parking lot is an experience in gourmet flavors in comparison, you know you're doing something wrong. Mom won't be back at that hospital - hopefully no one else I know will either, so I can confidently say I will not be back.

A few weeks ago, I woke up with terrible pain in my neck and shoulder. Could barely turn my head and I was excruciating to lift a coffee cup. Figured I slept wrong - a day of taking it easy and a good night's sleep, and I'd be all better.  WRONG! It was worse the next day.  I didn't want to go to an ER for a stiff neck - but too many of the "chain" urgent cares will not prescribe pain meds under any circumstances. And I don't have a primary care doctor. Around the time they opened, I read that Arcadia is owned and operated by emergency room doctors. While it's still a business, and still a for-profit business, this makes me a little more comfortable than a lot of the walk in clinics staffed with PA's or NP's that have their hands tied by the corporate office.  I called Arcadia Urgent Care and was assured, if the doctor found it warranted, I would be given pain meds. I got a ride there (didn't feel safe driving - with the pain and not being able to turn my head and all...) and waited.  And waited. And waited. (Hence the missing 5th star.) With how apologetic the staff was for the wait time, I get the impression it's not the norm - but it was still part of my experience.  I was finally called back by the doctor. She was wonderful. Great bedside manner and I felt safe in her hands. She gave me a diagnosis, a prescription for something stronger than Advil, a referral to an orthopedic specialist in case it wasn't better in a few days, and sent me on my way. in this case, that's *exactly* that I went in for. I knew I'd get either pain killers, muscle relaxers or anti-inflammatories (or a combo thereof), and that's what urgent care clinics should be there for. The non-life threatening issues that sometimes don't wait for regular appointments.  Thank you, Arcadia Urgent Care - you fill a need in the community, and we're glad you're here!

How have I not reviewed St. Francis yet?  I was just coming on to do an update - and see I never got around to it the first time?  I must be losing it! I've been here many times since they opened.  From happy hours alone at the bar chatting with Boots to dinners with family and/or friends - and finally, today, for brunch.  Every visit, every time, like clockwork - the service is great and the food exceeds expectations.  And on the visits I drink, the cocktails are consistently top notch.  Yes, I adore the feel of the room and the architecture. Yes, I've made my way happily across the menu and back. My consistently favorite thing about St. Francis - the most brilliant thing I can think of they've done - the kids' menu.  More to the point - the price of the items on the kids' menu.  FREE!  Sure - it's a bit ironic that I am so impressed with this - as I don't have children, and I don't appreciate dining in a room with most children.  But - maybe it's the atmosphere, maybe it's the non Denny's/IHOP/Village Inn feel of the menu - but the trash parents who don't raise the sort of child who should be in a decent restaurant just don't show up here anyway.  Every one of the children I've seen here has been well behaved and at appropriate volumes.    What the free kid's menu has done is keep St. Francis on the top of my list whenever I want to have a meal out with my child-rearing friends.  Which is how I ended up having an amazing brunch there this morning.  I know it's done the same for other people I know in the area who frequent the restaurant.  It's an abso-fuckin-lutely brilliant PR move!  So, yes - 5 stars.  One each for Food, Drink, Service, Architecture and Free Kids Meals!

Looks like it's been about a year and a half since I did my St. Francis review. Good timing - as I was asked to suggest dinner ideas for my cousins visiting from New York. And ideas for Sunday brunch with a dear friend and her daughter. So happy we decided to come here! (Yes - two visits in one weekend - score for me!)  For dinner - we arrived close to 6:30, a party of 4 with no reservations. No problem - we were seated in under 20 minutes (we got lucky!) We ordered way too much food - the four of us shared 2 apps, 3 salads and 2 entrees - as well as a few cocktails. It was all SO GOOD! Our server Barry was perfectly on point through the night - my NYC cousins were sufficiently impressed - and St. Francis retains its placement as one of my favorite Valley restaurants.   Fingerling potatoes, baked goat cheese, romaine hearts, kale ceasar, beets, roasted salmon superfood and the special that night of half a roasted chicken. All prepared and plated beautifully. None of us had room for dessert - so that will be a goal for next time!  For brunch Sunday - we arrived at 10:15 - I had made reservations and we were seated immediately. Cocktails and coffee for the grownups, mocktail for the daughter. We shared a baker's board and ordered the kid's pancake, smoked salmon flatbread and tomato baked eggs. There was no room for dessert - but with the lemon and pear muffin, carrot cake and cinnamon roll from the baker's board - we didn't really need it.  Once again - and proving the consistency in service and food from my first review - St. Francis does it right! So happy to have it nearby - and need to keep it on my heavy rotation list!

Add me to the list of people with MAJOR issues on the delivery accuracy and customer service on this place.  People in my office used to order from here all the time. At least 4 or 5 times each week - sometimes several deliveries in one day. And we considered it one of the best delivery options we had. Then orders started getting messed up. More often then they were right. More people here refuse to order from Rosati's than are welcome to take the risk - knowing it's more than likely they won't get what they ordered or how they ordered it. About six months ago, I ordered for three of us - and there were several issues. When I called, a woman claiming to be the manager offered me a $10.00 credit. When I called for the next delivery and tried to get the credit, there was no record of it. My last straw was last Monday. I thought I was brilliant by ordering online - where I could specify anything specific and it was all in clear print - no chance to mess up, right?  HA! I ordered a an Italian beef sandwich with peppers, onions and light mozzarella; a small Greek salad and a brownie for me. Also got cheese sticks with marinara for one coworker and the "duo" (shown on the menu as fried mushrooms and zucchini) with ranch for another. Delivery came in one hour, 15 minutes. Everything was lukewarm, including the salad. The cheese sticks were barely edible. The duo came with cauliflower instead of zucchini (would not have been ordered at all if cauliflower had been advertised) and the ranch was missing. The mushrooms were referred to as glue by the coworker who ate one, and threw away the rest. My sandwich was OK. Not great, but OK. And the salad was fine - after I put it in the fridge for a few hours. I'd love to tell you about the brownie - but it wasn't with the order. I called and spoke with a gal who claimed to be the manager. She offered me a credit, or she could send a driver back with the ranch, some zucchini and my brownie. No luck with the last credit I was offered - and I really didn't want to wait another hour for ranch (no longer needed, as the food it was requested for was thrown away) and my brownie. I asked those items be refunded to my credit card. I was told the owners would call me the next day. That was over a week ago. Rosati's on Thomas - I am sad to say you have worked your way onto my DO NOT CALL list. My coworkers were right. I was wrong. Enjoy my money - you won't be seeing any more of it. And I can't think of anyone from my office who disagrees at this point.

Three cheers to Yelp for helping me find where in the Valley to go for real beef jerky!  The fresh stuff which has more beef than chemicals.  (The convenience store packages just were not doing it for me!) After checking out the website, I emailed good friends in Las Vegas (who used to live in Minnesota), asking if they were familiar with Von Hanson's.  (They have 21 locations in Minnesota - and ONE in Chandler.)  My roommate and I went on July 2. They were running a special for NY strips - buy one, get one free - so that was added to the plan in addition to the jerky.SCORE!  We picked up a half pound each of the peppered jerky and the cajun spicy.  $18/lb.  The NY strips were (if memory serves...) $14.99/lb, and the steaks were averaging a little over 3/4 lb - so super yay for the BOGO sale - it brought the meat down to regular grocery prices. I have to say - the quality of the meat is amazing!  Just looking at the cuts in the display case, I can declare Von Hanson's makes AJ's look like Fry's!  These were GORGEOUS!  Quite possibly the prettiest steaks I've ever seen!I also grabbed a couple pigs ears for my dog, and the roommate picked up a package of her favorite kind of sausage (linguisa).  Admittedly, I am not a sausage expert.  Plus, I live very close to Schreiner's - so while I would have no problem buying sausage from Von Hanson's, I wouldn't make the hike to Chandler just for those.  The selection was quite impressive, though!  Overall - this place has everything for carnivorial happiness!  (Hey - if you understood the context, it's a word, right?)  Great selection of beef, chicken and pork products.  Tons of spices, sauces, rubs and marinades.  Nice selection of unique beer and wines.  Fridge and freezer cases with more meats, sides, and desserts! Yes, it's pricey - but the quality is certainly there to justify it.  Once home, we grilled up the steaks using our favorite rub.  OMG amazing meat!  Probably the best steak I've had in YEARS - and NY strip isn't even my cut of choice!  The peppered beef jerky is full of YUM - and this is so strange to write - but the Cajun is a bit spicy for my taste.  (And I adore spicy!)  It's amazingly good, and addictive - but almost requires a cold beer to go along with it to help cut the heat.  The Vegas via Minnesota friends emailed back Monday - they know Von Hanson's quite well - and are grateful there isn't one in Vegas - it would KILL the weekly grocery budget with how often they'd be in!  They love, love, LOVE the place - and I am now under strict orders to bring them care packages from here whenever I come up to visit!  Oh - and Layla (my pooch) was pretty stoked about the pig ears - so in addition to my five stars, please add two paws up!  (I didn't tell her they have a whole dog food and treat section - I am on a budget, after all!)

I've been in many times over the years. Brunch, lunch, happy hour, dinner. And it's consistently good. Quite good. Not amazing, not life changing, but solid good quality, good service and a very comfortable dining room.  Most recently was brunch with a friend. I am a huge fan of the $4 carafe of Bloody Mary. My heartburn isn't as big a fan, but that's what Tums are for!  We shared the cheese and fruit plate appetizer with the added meat option. The cheese of the day was a sage cheddar. Okay - it wasn't really cheddar. I don't remember the name, but it was similar to a cheddar and quite tasty. Add some salami, prosciutto, strawberries, grapes, jam, almonds, water crackers and baguette and it was a lovely way to start brunch!  I had the chilaquilles - not the best I've ever had - but quite tasty. Just think I'll explore other options next time. Nothing wrong with them - just not to my taste.  My companion had the special - poached eggs, asparagus and prosciutto. He was the clear winner in the ordering department - the presentation was photo worthy and while I neglected to ask how it was, he finished it all without hesitation - so I am thinking it must have been good.  Will definitely be back!

Ohhh, Papu - what you do to me!  Kim T. brought me here for lunch when running errands one day.  As she'd been here before, I trusted her to order - that woman does not mess around when it comes to food, and she seems to know just what to aim for on every menu!  My lunch was the Papu - huge BBQ sandwich - we opted for the hot link and brisket.  White bread, slathered in sauce.  Oh, that sauce!  A BBQ place is made or broken on the sauce - and OMG I wish the Rideau's would bottle the stuff!  Ha!  They do!  Brilliant!  It comes with a side - and there are so many good ones, it's hard to choose.  I went with the daily special side - fried cabbage on the Friday we were there.  YUM!  Can't say I ever had it before, so nothing to compare it to, but I was loving it!  I can't wait to bring my mom's husband in - he's gonna love me forever for this one!  And next time I'm having a gathering, TT2 is at the very top of my very short list of caterers!

Enjoyed a Sunday brunch here a group of friends. Cheap breakfast, build you own Bloody Mary bar AND cool people? Yes, thank you!  There was nothing special about the breakfast itself, but nothing wrong with it, either - I opted for the $4 plate - eggs, toast, potatoes, bacon and sausage (I opted for all bacon.) It's a good value for $4, but nothing spectacular. The $5 Bloody Mary was great - but if it wasn't, that's my own fault!  Also available are $3 mimosas.  There were box games the kids could play while waiting for food and to not get too bored while we old and boring adults were having old and boring adult conversations.  I've always enjoyed Heritage Square, the beer selection is good, and hanging out in a an old house with creaky wood floors, or on the patio under the trees is a very casual, comfortable "come hang out awhile" vibe that I truly appreciate.  Definitely a nice place for breakfast, probably cool any time of day.

Oh, Lucky Boy! You've been doing it since 1951 - and you still do it right! A quarter pound burger with whatever toppings I want AND fries for under $5 - that was definitely not made until I ordered it? Yes, PLEASE! Lots of available shake and malt flavors? Yum! Quick service and a drive through, right around the corner from my house? Lucky Boy, you make me realize I am a very Lucky Girl!

Two-for-one Thursday! There may be other specials - but two-for-one Thursday should make anyone on a budget smile! It gets better! I ordered my drink - and got a voucher for the second. The voucher is good for a MONTH! The place is much larger than I expected based on seeing it from the street. Pool tables, games, a very large (and nicely stocked) bar - and an incredible patio! (Bar access from the patio, too - bonus!) Generally, I am not impressed with the bathrooms designated for women in gay bars. It's an afterthought, at best. The ladies' room is clean, well-stocked, and has a phenomenal vessel sink. I was so impressed with the sink, I grabbed my male friend and dragged him in just to share the beauty. I am also not usually impressed with the service I get in gay bars. I get it, I am female - not the target clientele. At Bar 1, I get the impression they are truly open for business to everyone. I was served just as quickly and in the same friendly manner as everyone else.  That may seem like a no-brainer to anyone with business sense - but it's not the experience I have had at other establishments. I felt very welcome here - the crowd was laid back and friendly, the mood was good, and I can see Bar1 making into regular rotation quite easily. Did I mention Two-for-one Thursday? :)

I don't get sick. Not sick enough to justify a medical professional anyway.  Well, phyiscally. I mean physically.  Well, I got sick - and I wasn't kicking it. Since I don't go to doctors, I don't have a primary care physician. I knew I needed antibiotics, so off to NextCare I go.  The wait was long and annoying - but I had the entertainment of Facebook to pass the time. (After I checked in, many friends asked why, out of concern. Turns out my self-diagnosis was wrong. It wasn't priapism. Go figure.) Once I was called back, all went quickly and easily.  The man doing intake remembered me from a work-related injury about a year ago - I made him laugh then, as well.  Dr. Mike is thorough, asks relevant questions to ensure no bad reactions, and off I went with prescriptions in hand. Easy on the eyes, too. While that truly doesn't matter at all in determining quality medical care, it was a happy little bonus for me.  I should probably either a) get a primary care physician I can call upon when I need the good cough medicine and antibiotics; b) do a more diligent job of never getting sick enough to need meds; or c) keep doing what I've been doing, and just hit up a clinic the once every couple of years I need it.  Assuming I opt for c), I'm glad NextCare is right up the street.

Yet another case of Yelp serving it's purpose perfectly! I needed movers. I don't know any. Did a Yelp search, found Camelback Movers with fantastic reviews (including some from Yelp friends!)  I called on a Tuesday and was able to schedule two men and a moving truck to be at my house between 7:30 and 9:30 Saturday morning.  Andre and Tomas arrived at 8:30 and were amazing. In addition to being quick and careful (and strong as oxen!), they were both very friendly. Everything I had going with them was loaded on the truck, moved, and unloaded in about two hours. No damage on ANYTHING!  Camelback moving also provides storage - and I had some items that just would not fit in the new place, but I am not willing to part with. The rate for the size storage was just about half of what other self storage facilities wanted! And - Camelback movers brought my stuff there.  No extra effort on my part!  I am thrilled with the service - from the initial call to arrange everything, to how quickly and easily the move went, to the final call I got later in the day confirming my grand total. Which ended up being LESS than was estimated.  Thank you, Camelback Moving - I will gladly refer you to others, and gladly use you again. Thank you, Yelp - for doing exactly what you were created for. Real people made real reviews. I am real happy!

Is this great sushi?  No.  Does this food reinvent the sushi wheel?  Not even close.  Will I have a foodgasm?  Not a chance. When I am craving an amazing sushi meal, I'll go to Yasu.  Why I really, REALLY like Teharu: The food is fresh.  While it's not amazing fish, there's nothing wrong with it - nothing here to get sick from. All the standards are readily available and if you want something not already on the belt, they'll gladly make it for you. The conveyor really feeds into my lack of patience.  I sat down, ordered an iced green tea, and started pulling plates off the belt.  Yes, I was eating sushi within 90 seconds of sitting down! The price is a HUGE plus!  I met a friend for lunch - we each had iced tea, several plates with 3 or 4 roll slices, seaweed salad, sunumono salad and a couple nigiri and I was out of there for less than $20, including tip. The place is kept incredibly clean, staff is friendly and Teharu fills a nice niche for a super casual, quick sushi place.  When it comes down to it, I can't always afford to spend what that quantity of food would cost me at Yasu or any of the other great places in town - I like that I am not committing to a whole roll - I can sample from 5 or 6 different ones.  Fills the need for the sushi craving on a buget and/or when strapped for time.

Maizie's, Maizie's, Maizie's - why do I keep forgetting about you??  I like your food and drink, I like the feel of your room, I like everyone that staffs you - and I LOVE some of your specials.   Really - I should be at Maizie's at LEAST once a week. Strangely - I end up at Maizie's just a few times a year. And as I'm a facebook fan, I even get daily lunch special updates, and still don't think to go in. I don't know why this is, as I've only had good experiences, the location is super-convenient for me, and, especially at happy hour, the prices are great!   I've been in twice this month - which is impressive for me, as it may have been a year ago I was in before that. A Saturday birthday brunch (three gals, two of which were having birthdays) with FANTASTIC $3 Bloody Mary's. I had the southwestern style benedict and was thrilled - both birthday girls were also quite happy with their entrees. Josiah was our server - and quickly became the most recent crush on my list! XOXO.   Then a midweek happy hour at the bar with Adam - who just plain rocked! Girlfriend and I each had a sangria and split two of the happy hour appetizers - and were STUFFED! I ordered another to go, as I was on my way to work and it could serve as dinner. Really - $5 apps. $3 beer, house wine, sangria! Happy hour, indeed!   LOVE the beer selections as well - lots of new ones to try all the time - and at $3 a piece, it doesn't matter so much if I'm not a fan.   I don't know why I keep forgetting you're there. Why you're not always at the top of my go-to list. You've done everything right, quite consistently. This is my shortcoming - and I'll work on fixing it! See you soon!

I've lived in this city a long time. I've heard great things about Christopher's for as many years as I can remember - and even better things about the happy hour. I never made in until this week for Restaurant Week. Shame on me for waiting so damn long!  My dining partner and I decided to share each course so we could sample more of the offerings, and we both opted for the wine pairings for each course.  First up was a bowl with goat cheese filled mini ravioli with herbs and truffle in the light and lovely sauce, and the mixed greens with goat cheese in parmesan crust. Both were a great way to start the meal  - but the winner of the two was the salad.  Second course we shared frog legs and an onion tart with bacon. It was my first experience with munching one of Kermit's kickers - I thought it was tasty, but my companion felt it was a bit under seasoned. The onion tart was PERFECT. (Hands down winner of the course - we each lamented sharing it, wishing we had each ordered our own.)  Third course was sole sauteed with lobster sauce and coq au vin. The chicken was perfectly cooked - still super moist and juicy, and the flavor was solid. The sole, however, was heavenly! Absolute perfection on a plate. Rich, but still light filet of sole, the lobster sauce was almost a bisque. Served with cauliflower, this is definitely a dish to return for!  We shared a great chocolatey dessert - with killer chocolate sorbet! (the sorbet was better than the layer cake) - and a great little plus was being presented with a restaurant week celebratory baguette after we'd paid.  I will definitely be back - it's so good, and so close to home...Christopher's, you are now on my regular rotation!

Gotta love the Sno Balls! I have never been to New Orleans during the warm months - all my trips have been late October - early January - so I have never tried a Sno Ball in it's natural habitat.  That said...I have a bunch of NOLA friends - and they all assure me this is the real deal. While I have to take their word on the authenticity for now - my own taste buds tell me this is GREAT!  Sure - most of the flavors and the concept is similar to a snow cone. But the ice is shaved so much finer - it's an amazing texture - not at all grainy.  Really like the Rocky Mountain snow I grew up with in northern New Mexico.  Over 50 flavors to choose from - check out the website, or better yet - go in and get one (or 5!)  Great for kids 2-92!

For years, I frequented Willo House. And I don't know why. The place was dirty and cramped. Sanitation was questionable at best. Plumbing in the restroom was hit and miss. And the stench of patchouli *still* makes me nauseous. But I was under 21, and coffeehouses were the only places we could nurse a drink for hours and be allowed to hang out.  I had some good times there, made some friends and saw some good bands play our front. Back then, I couldn't help but thing - what would happen if they cleaned this place up?  If they did some basic improvements and made themselves appeal to people with, you know - JOBS? The location is great, the property is great - and the old house has so much character and charm.  It had so much potential - just get rid of the patchouli freaks, raise the bar on food and drink options and the place could be great. Flash forward.  Willo House is dead and gone. And Hob Nob assumed the location. I can't believe it's the same house!  It's - well - CLEAN!  Bathrooms (there are 2 now!) are modern and clean and functional. Walls have been sanded and repainted (no longer fear splinters from resting my hand on a door jam.) They still support local artists, and wares are for sale throughout. The baristas are knowledgeable of the products, efficient and friendly! Thank you, proprietors of Hob Nob - you have brought the vision I had so many years ago to life. Now I know what it could be if the potential were realized - and it is lovely! +100 for the beer and wine license and the great selection of bottled beers - for when I am not in the mood for coffee.

I haven't been in this location, but my roommate brings home family packs quite often.  I haven't sampled much of the menu - but have spent many occasions making a glutton of myself with the chicken, catfish and cole slaw.  The slaw is a standard commercial recipe.  It's fresh and crunchy, but nothing to make it special.  It just happens that I love plain old boring coleslaw, so that's a bonus for me!  The catfish has always been good quality and decent sized pieces - but not whole filets.  The chicken is just what you'd want from fried chicken!  The breading (seems to be same for chicken at catfish) is spot on with great flavor - and they always have a perfect crunch to grease ratio. Hot and fresh or cold from the fridge for breakfast, Lousiana Fried Chicken understands why we love fried chicken and they make it well.  Strange bonus - on day 1 and 2 the overall flavor is enhanced with hot sauce (the best way to eat fried chicken, yo!) - but the spice in the breading has developed so much by the end of day 2 that you really don't need it. The roommate brought home a dozen or so pieces the Friday of Labor Day weekend.  Monday's leftovers had such kick, a beer was required to be able to quench the fire and finish lunch.  And that was with no additional hot sauce.  (Imagine Cajun Chef Justin Wilson tossing in a "whhhoooooeeee, I gar-un-tee!)

I usually give Layla (black lab/pointer mix) baths at home...but with her black nails, I am afraid to trim as I can't see the quick.  They've been getting long...last pedicure was at the vet in early March - and I have scratch marks all over me to prove it.  I found A Family Affair by the Happy Hour sign on 16th St.  I went in last week, spoke with Troy, and made an appointment for today to have Layla's nails trimmed.  She is a nervous dog, not thrilled to be on a leash and not happy to be handled by strangers.  That said, we had a GREAT experience!  She was handled gently, spoken to softly, and I was allowed to go back and pet her head and talk to her while getting the clipping done. Fast and painless...they even used a dremel to file down the edges so they are smooth.  I will definitely be back for all our nail visits...and next time, I think I'll let them take care of the bath, too!

I am so disappointed in myself.  I have lived within a mile or so of Nogales Hot Dogs for going on 8 years. I have lived within a half mile for the last 7 months.  And it wasn't until recently I actually stopped and got a couple dogs. So many great Yelp reviews. So many great reviews from my friends. And for years, I have deprived myself of this little bit of mouth-magic!  The buns (like everyone else has mentioned) are amazing! Cloudlike, soft, but able to stand up to the dog and all the toppings. I loaded mine up with everything - and loved every last bite. Washed it down with a Mexican Coke (yay, real sugar!) and was a very very happy girl!  I put the second dog in the fridge and brought it to work for breakfast the next day. While the bread wasn't quite as perfect - I can vouch that as a fork and knife breakfast, even the day old Nogales Dog is still a winner!

Restaurant Week dinner, party of three.  How have I not been here before? This place is wonderful and provided a fantastic dining experience! It was clean, well spaced, light and bright for a steakhouse, and the service was absolutely flawless beginning to end.  The Chef's amuse was a warm chicken liver pate and fresh country bread. Possibly the best pate I've ever had. The popovers (served with fresh butter and sea salt) are amazing. I think they know this - as there was the added super-cool touch of including a recipe card for the popovers on the plate. (And yes - any bread recipe that calls for gruyere is going to be amazing!) We all opted for the carpaccio appetizer. Melt in my mouth perfection! Dishes like this are exactly why I have carpaccio cravings! We also all opted for the flat iron steak - we were at a steakhouse after all. I enjoyed the fresno chile butter - it was a pleasant change from plain or gorgonzola butter that I've had elsewhere. As expected, the steaks were cooked perfectly. Happily, we each wanted a different side - grilled white asparagus, tater tots, and broccoli mac and cheese. They were served in iron dishes at the center of the table, and there was plenty for each of us to enjoy all three. Not a bad choice in the bunch! (But the tater tots need to be issued a new name. With how incredible they are, if I call them tots, I will never be able to look at another tot without feeling sadness that they just don't measure up to what BLT was serving. Need to ask for that recipe!) We also went across the menu with dessert, so we were able to share all three. As each of us felt the one we ordered was the best, it was once again, winners all the way around. Bonus dessert - chocolate chip petite fours straight from the oven. Absolute perfection!  Mix this all in with a fantastic Manhattan (or two),  and a great view of Camelback Mountain at sunset - and it was a recipe for an absolutely perfect meal! Can't wait to go back!

I was the first customer in today when they opened. I was about to order what I thought was too much food at too much money, when I saw the lunch specials on the back page. So - for under $10, I got to try the gumbo AND a po boy!  I opted for the catfish po boy, gladly accepted the side or Louisiana Hot Sauce (I am out at home!) and took the food home with me. I was very impressed with the po boy - fish was hot, crisp and moist - bread was perfect - lettuce and tomato fresh as can be!  I honestly couldn't tell if it was dressed with mayo or remoulade (guessing it was a combo of the two...not enough flavor to be remoulade, too much for mayo) - but once I put some Red Spot on it, the sauce didn't matter too much, anyway. That filled me up, so the gumbo was eaten out of the fridge a few hours later.  The chicken pieces were big and moist, the andouille was sliced thin and the overall flavor was so smokey perfect I was sad to only have a small cup of it! When I first was taught to make gumbo, I heard you need to either use okra OR file.  (A powder made from sassafras.)  I generally use both - but the lack of okra didn't detract from the perfect balance this gumbo was! A coworker commented to me several weeks ago the gumbo was too "soupy."  Not sure what his gripe was here...every bowl of gumbo I enjoyed in NOLA was just this texture. Happily, my sister lives nearby - so now that I have been, I will be back again and again!  (Note to Miss Jennifer - I will be in on Saturday to enjoy a beignet!  I hope the coffee is with chickory!)

Restaurant Week UYE!  Great food, great service, amazing views and STELLAR company! Thanks, Joe B. for setting it all up!  I started off menu with a half dozen oysters. Not the best I've ever had, but NOLA and Boston and NYC have spoiled me. These were quite nice, though.  Next up was the beet and goat cheese salad (such a sucker for that flavor combo!) and it did not disappoint!  The steak and broccoli were superb, and the dessert of granny smith apple cobbler with cinnamon ice cream was a perfect ending.   A couple of Maker's Mark Old Fashioned's to wash it all down - I was definitely a happy camper.  I'll definitely add this to my "special occasion" list of places to go - it was a perfect and lovely evening!

I've been coming to Market for years - but not as often as I like. For some reason, I only think of it when it's time to mention it to someone else.  This time around, it was the made to order crepes. A friend I work with is obsessed with crepes - so I thought of the Saturday Market to tell her about it.  We went last Saturday, each ordered a savory crepe ($8) and a mimosa ($5). We were both very happy with our crepes - and too full to go for anything else.  Pizza, paella, crepes, omelets, pastry, fresh fruits and veggies. Breads, oils, cheeses, olives, arts and crafts, and lots of shaded tables.  I love this place for brunch!

Fast, cheap, fresh, great flavor and super close to home! This is a perfect neighborhood place.  Decor sucks, menu on wall and handed out is only a fraction of what's available, based on all the hand written signs for other items they have. We have better luck getting the order to-go from the counter instead of the drive-thru.  That way, we can pack our own salsas from the variety avaialbe - or risk getting none in the bag if we're too lazy to leave our car. So far, I've been stuck on the carnitas and pollo asado mini tacos - I really want to explore more of the menu - but can't get away from the YUM I know! Did share the roommate's quesadilla once - GREAT tortilla!   So happy to have it close and open late!

Not for me, thanks.  I'm from New Mexico.  Not far from Taos, in fact.  This is NOT New Mexican style food, and it is NOT Taos style food.  At least, not a place that plans on staying in business.  Sure, the place is cute.  Sure, the people are nice and friendly and provide decent service.  Sure, the price vs. quantity ratio is more than fair. And the food isn't the type of bad that will make you sick.  Had I been going with the aim of getting some Americanized Mexican style food, I may have given more stars.  But to me, going to Gil's for New Mexican food is akin to going to Idaho for good Mexican food.  It's just not happening.  Sigh.  And for the love of all that's right and good - will SOMEONE in this town learn to make a real sopapilla???

What a great little treasure! After a great UYE breakfast, Norm R. and I were driving and I remembered seeing something about Singh Farms. I asked Norm if he was interested in checking it out with me - and happily, he was! I had read it was a farmer's market at a farm, and had other vendors and food available. I didn't realize how beautiful, peaceful and charming it would be! Lots of trails around the farm leading to various seating areas wind around various food crops and flowers, mostly shaded by large trees. There were several fire pits and fireplaces set up and burning, each with people sitting and enjoying the morning with coffee, food, and fresh juice. An accordionist was playing, which really added to the ambiance.  Such a pleasant place to spend a morning! I left with beets, eggs, yams, and red potatoes. There was also a great selection of herbs, citrus, artisan bread, honey, seeds, greens and more! Also chickens and horses and a peacock - as well as compost (which is what I hear was the original intention of the farm). It's easy to forget you're so close to the city - this place transcends time and place - it's just that lovely. I definitely look forward to coming back on many Saturdays in the future! (Saturday only, 9 to 2.)

A gem to remind us what Phoenix *can* be, in a utopian sense. Locally owned and operated restaurant, in a locally owned and operated hotel.  The decor is stylish and casually comfortable, with LOTS of local art on the walls available for purchase.  Went this past weekend for a UYE and had a BLAST!  Even my boo-boo drink mix up was A-OK!  Started with a happy hour Bloody Mary.  (That's a Sunday law, right?)  Once our group was seated, I got another.  (If one is good, two is GREAT, right?) I ordered the elote to start with - planning on eating light to save room for dessert (and more drinks, RIGHT?)  Darn that Lynn W - she is *such* a bad influence.  Tacos, too!  One each please - carne asada, cochinita and fish!  And that brings us to the mistake.  I meant to order the "La Ruso" - which is Hendrick's gin, ginger beer and lime.  Instead, I asked for the "Paloma" - wich is El Jimador Resposado tequila, grapefruit soda, lime and salt.  The drink was tasty.  Soooo tasty.  Tasty enough that I neglected to enforce my NO TEQUILA rule.  At the beginning of the night, I even told a couple of my companions that my next tattoo will be a med-alert bracelet reading 'allergic to tequila!"  But I drank it.  I drank it all!  When the tacos came (the cochinita was good, but not as good as La Condesa, the carne asada and fish were AMAZING!), I corrected the gaffe by ordering my La Ruso.  Fantastic drink - but I probably should have skipped it, as by that time, I could barely tell the flavor difference between the two, and had to have others at the table confirm by taste I got the right drink.  But hey - if three drinks are great, four must be fantastic, right?  The stragglers of the group (Lynn W, Norm R and I) shared the orange cake for dessert.  Just sweet enough to refresh our mouths - but not at all overpowering.  And incredibly moist.  When all was said and done -  The food and drink were as good as ever!  The service was spot on and she had a GREAT attitude! I happily made great new Yelp friends!   What a fantastic way to wrap up the weekend!

I visited for Jazz Brunch last Sunday, and will definitely be back! Most everything was incredibly fresh and flavorful.  The only less than perfect items were the bacon and sausage.  Pretty much tasteless.  But - the Italian sausage with peppers and onions in red sauce made up for that, IMHO. I barely touched any of the salad fixings - but they were well presented and looked super-fresh. Made to order omelettes and a prime rib carving station are expected staples at brunches - and Verona does them well. My super exciting suprise finds:  rum balls and Bailey's creme stuffed French Toast.  For a girl who doesn't do well with dairy, I decided it would be worth the price I'd be paying later.  I was right! :) The chocolate dipped strawberries were among the best I've had. As usual, I ate way too much.  Just a couple bites of this and a taste of that add up way too fast and make 2 big plates of food!  Eeek!  Definitely a good brunch, whether you're a gambler or not. And to make it better, note that Happy Hour is ALL DAY Sunday in the casino.  Half price on well, house wine and beer. Bloody Mary was $3.10 at the bar, $6.20 ordered at the table.  Get there early and get your drink on!  The jazz duo (vocals and piano) was well suited for the room.  Non invasive and the singer had a nice Diana Krall thing going for her.  I know it was a nice brunch, because five days later, I'm still happy about it and I lost way more money than I planned on in the casino after we ate. :)

I was just going through my reviews, and was shocked that Arcadia Tavern wasn't done long ago! I am a fan of the New Orleans Saints. There is, as far as I know, ONE organized Saints group in the Phoenix area. And they watch at Arcadia Tavern. While I had been in with friends several times before knowing this, I'm a regular during football season now, and have been for quite some time. The management is fantastic. Truly customer satisfaction driven. They have gone above and beyond on several occasions for the viewing group as a whole, and for me personally. The service is hit and miss. I know we can be a large and unruly group sometimes - but many of the servers are clearly new and not fully trained on how to best deal with us.  Some servers (Erica, I'm talking to you!) are incredible - and should give seminars on how to get it done well and with a smile! The place itself is comfortable and well appointed, and I am impressed with how they have really incorporated locals and the area into the feel and theme. The menu is solid. Plenty of choices no matter what your dietary restrictions, hunger level or mood. And it's all well executed.  Great specials - and easy to feel welcome. Their slogan is "All good in the hood" - and Arcadia - you are "What's good in the hood!"

Family came in from New York - and breakfast at the Hyatt has become something of a tradition for my cousins. We met here on a Friday mid-morning, and all four of us opted for the buffet. Nice selection of pastry, fruit, bacon, sausage, pancakes, scrambled eggs, eggs Benedict, made to order omelets and bagels with smoked salmon and all the expected add-ons for that. Nice strong Bloody Mary, flavorful coffee, and a lovely morning out on the patio.  Yes - you are paying resort prices. That said - if seated outside, you have a view of one of my favorite resorts in town.  Not something I can afford to do daily - and not something I'd want to. But for a nice change of pace - and a way to welcome my cousins to Arizona for this too-brief visit, it was perfect.

I've been here a few times over the past couple of years - for brunch and staff meal, mostly. My best friend and I brought my mom once, and she fell in love  - and asked to come here for Mother's Day. Good call, Mom! We were seated in the courtyard. I was a bit concerned it would be too warm - but the misters did their job and the table was shaded, so it was quite pleasant. And lovely to be amongst the plants. Prix fixe menu with three appetizers, three entrees and three desserts to choose from, with champagne and mimosas. My mom, her husband and I did the appetizers the right way. Mom ordered the crepe Suzette, her husband had the mushroom quiche and I had the beet cured gravlax. With trying one of each, we were able to sample across all the offerings. And we ordered right - each of us felt that while each was great, we each had the best one. Win across the board! We dropped the perfect plan with the entrees. None of us found the chicken very appealing. Mom and hubby each had the steak with gruyere Yorkshire pudding and haricots verts, I had the salmon with heirloom tomatoes and Yukon golds. This time, everyone agreed - while the steak was great, my salmon was the hands down winner. The best salmon I've had in years, possibly ever. The sample it all plan failed miserably with dessert. We ALL opted for the beignets with Nutella drizzle.  I knew they wouldn't be NOLA style beignets  - I've had them here before. I guess I should have warned the others. While they were quite enjoyable as yummy fried balls of dough with Nutella and powdered sugar - they were NOT what they had imagined. Happily - there was enough flowing mimosas that no one minded, really!  I was a wee bit flustered with the pricing. Normal Sunday brunch is $35. Mother's Day was $49. Granted...it's Mother's Day. Places can charge whatever they want - it's one of the busiest restaurant days of the year. Heck, I knew it going in, and I was willing to pay it. But really, it wasn't notably better than the regular brunch. Yes - everything was beautifully plated, tasted fantastic and we had great service across the board. But that's something I've come to expect from every visit to Petite Maison.  Maybe next time, I will take Mom here for a normal Sunday brunch, and go all out for Mother's Day at home.  Lovely Mother's Day brunch, overall - and a good reminder that I need to get Petite Maison back on my regular rotation. It had been too long!

A whole bunch of years ago, a man brought me to Pho Bang on a 'friend date'. It was my first experience with Vietnamese food - and I was hooked! on the food, not on him. Countless visits to Pho Bang, and just as many to the newer, larger, cleaner incarnation - Pho Thanh! While my standby has been an order of spring rolls, a bowl of pho and a cafe sua da (sweetened iced coffee), I've been all over the menu. The bun bowls, the specialty plates, all the appetizers, the banh mi (sandwiches). And I have been happy every visit. I've had men bring me here on first, or at least early dates - as a litmus test for their appreciation of ethnic dives. I've met dear friends here for catch-up on life meals. I've come many times with my former neighbor or my roommate(s) - because when the craving hits, it seems to hit everyone at once. When I start to feel a cold coming on, I think pho is a better medicine than chicken noodle soup!  I love this place!

I am a little shocked right now. Not only have I not reviewed Bluewater, I somehow even missed posting a review back when the building housed Fish Market! That strikes me as very, very wrong!  I've been coming to this building for fishy meals for a lot of years. And I am sure those memories play into how highly I regard this place.  From the most recent visits -  I can eat my weight in fresh, crusty sourdough bread! The bucket of mussels and clams (which we tend to ask for all clams) is always super tasty (and provides a great broth for soaking into the bread!) Happy hour from 12-5 on Sundays - $4.00 well, wine, draft and several well priced appetizers makes for a fantastic way to day drink, eat yourself stupid and spend a fantastic afternoon without breaking the bank. The raw bar generally has a nice selection, the sushi bar is a-ok. The New England Clam Chowder is the stuff comfort food is all about.  It may not be the swankiest fish house in town. None of the recipes will make you re-think what seafood can be. But it's always fresh, always consistent. Service has always been friendly and the one bad experience I have had here reflects on my own insane family - not the staff, the food or the place. And even the bad experience makes me laugh now.  And writing this review is making me crave the clam bucket and sourdough bread right now!!

S.L.O.W. service. It wasn't even busy when I went in. ONE person getting ONE drink ahead of me.  I place my order for a large honey vanilla latte with soy. Wait almost ten minutes. They wrote soy on the cup.  The barrista spent plenty of extra time making the foam at the top look like a swan. If I was drinking it there, that would have been nice. I ordered it to go. It was getting a lid on it and going to my car. I don't need pretty. I need caffeine! He announced "honey vanilla latte." I added, "soy?" And he said, "no."  He took the cup back, and started again.  I went in for a quick latte to go - on my way to work.  Total time - close to 20 minutes.  Not Okay.  That said - the latte was quite good. I may go back for another one. When I have lots of time to sit and sip and not care what the clock says.

One of my favorite dives!  I've been here when it's quiet, I've been here for live music, and I've been here for DJs and dancing. Day drinking, night drinking - and now they open at 6am, so I may even start occasional morning drinking here!   It's small, it's dark, it's a dive. A dive with a solid beer selection and a surprising stock of alcohol for the size. Hipsters, punks, old vets. White, Black, Hispanic, Native, Asian - everyone is here!  Staff is competent - and since I grade with a different set of standards when looking at dives - in the ladies room, both stall doors close and lock - there is always toilet paper, soap and paper towel. Given how some dives are, this place is a major treat!  I celebrated my last birthday here, have met new friends here and have had a blast dancing and imbibing and chatting with my friends for hours on end.  What more could I ask from a neighborhood haunt?

Happily, I have access to a card. Granted  - the quantities here are too large for the most part to be useful at home - only two of us live there - but WOW. The selection! The prices! I've spent thousands in the past on huge quantities of paper goods and soft drinks for a nonprofit I work with. Last week we were shopping for a party. I picked up a case of frozen corn cobs, a gallon of oil for the deep fryer, a case of plastic utensils and were on our way for CHEAP! My roommate saw the WHOLE GOATS from New Zealand in the cooler - and is now planning our next party - something that will necessitate buying a whole friggen goat!  Come for the selection, prices and helpful employees - come back for the goat!

Met a couple friends here for happy hour - I can't speak to the regular menu, just the happy hour offerings.  For round one, (the two gals)  we ordered the fries - $6, the antipasti for one(chef's choice)  - $7, and two of the grilled cheese sliders at $2.50 each.  Service was prompt and all the food was very tasty.   I knew about the bacon on the grilled cheese, but not the tomato.  I am not a fan of hot tomato, so I would have asked them to hold it had I known...but that's preference, not quality related.  The bread, chesse and bacon were just right...and I could have made a meal of these alone. The fries are thin cut, fresh and very nicely seasoned.  Everything you could want in a fry - and generous basket of them provided! The antipasti platter was my favorite.  Choice today was brie, sopressata, almonds and roasted tomato.  The bread served with it was perfect...crusty on the outside and heavenly pillow within.  Round two (the man joined us after he got off work), we ordered three additional grilled cheese sliders, the crispy shrimp and the chicken tenders ($5 each.)  I ordered the red wine cooler ($4 happy hour special, available in red, white and pink.)  As the server suggested - it was cool and refreshing with blackberry flavor. Loved the shrimp...similar to popcorn shrimp but perfectly exectued.  Hot and crispy outside, tender inside and lots of flavor.   Was let down by the chicken tenders.  Nothing wrong with them, per se...but everything else was so well done, the plainness of the chicken really stood out. Will definitely be back for happy hour...and as my bank account grows, I'll look forward to working my way down the very cool drink list!

Well, as this place is 4.5 stars after 144 reviews, it's not like I am going to share anything that will ruin the secrecy of this place and just how great it is!  I had plans to bring one friend here who is Dia De Los Muertos obsessed.  She blew me off, but I was so looking forward to it, I talked two other friends into joining me to check out a new spot.  The gal is a jamiaca fiend, and was thrilled with the drink.  Having read reviews on the size of the horchata, I convinced the guy to share one with me, we could always get another if we needed it.  (We didn't)  WOW - no other horchata will ever measure up!  Yes, the salsa bar ROCKED!  We sampled 6 or 7 of them.  I could live off the jicama, cilantro, jalepeno and lime tastiness!  And the hot red one that looked greasy had the most amazing heat/flavor ratio I could imagine ever encountering.  Truly, the acme salsa!  Being indecisive, I went a la carte with the tacos.  One each of the cochinita pibil, one chicken mole and one carne asada. I was busy having a foodgasm with the cochinita when the gal freaked on her carne asada, making the guy have some - and they both agreed it is better than America's Taco Shop!  (Mine had to sit and wait while I was having quality alone time with the last bites of the pork.)  I will say I wasn't thrilled with the mole.  This is NOT a knock on how La Condesa does it - and if you're a mole fan, it may be amazing.  I'd never actually had mole - turns out I am just not a fan of the overall flavor.  But I love almost all Mexican food, and I love chocolate!  How is this possible!  Two rights making a wrong?  Weird!  That said...I will be back.  Over and over!  This is definitely on the short list of places to have a quick, great meal in my hood!

I've been here a couple of times - it's not typical for me to go out of my way for frozen yogurt. Really appreciate how clean the store is kept - it looks brand new and spotless no matter the time of day - and the toppings bar area is constantly cleaned and replenished - always picture perfect.  There is a good variety of flavors available. (10, I think?) And the staff is always friendly and quick to offer samples.  Of course, as with most frozen yogurt places these days, you get to pile all the yuminess you want into the cup, and pay by weight when you're masterpiece is complete. That can add up REALLY fast!  Fresh, clean, friendly, and good selection of yogurt and toppings? I'll definitely be back!

I've made several visits to the Vig, and have been very happy each time. The first was one of the first HOT days in May.  I was job hunting, and decided a happy hour cocktail and bite was in order.  Three words"  TAKE BETHANY HOME!  It's the first on the list of "vignature" cocktails...and one of my new favorite drinks.  Julia was behind the bar, and had enough time to exchange a dirty joke with me to make me feel like a regular.  Two drinks and the happy hour sliders...YUM!  My only complaint...and this is the kind of complaint I am sure the owners love...there was too much food!  I am a big girl, and I can put away the chow...but two drinks and an appetizer and I was uncomfortably full!  Didn't even finish the fries - which were great, but I was too full! Second time was happy hour with a girlfriend.  We sat on the patio, shared a couple cocktails (I am stuck on Take Bethany Home, she tried the Moscow Mule...which was also great.)  We split the artichoke dip and the flatbread pizza.  Both were great...but once again - same issue.  Two women who are not afraid to eat - two cocktails and two appetizers...and there were leftovers! Another solo happy hour - I think I have it mastered...the wings are the right amount for one person and two drinks! Was in last night for the ribeye dinner special with my mom and her husband.  (YAY for industry and facebook fan discounts...I fit both categories!)  Mom and I had Take Bethany Home, her hubby had a couple Juan Gambinos.  For a man who only drinks scotch and water, I was impressed he left his comfort zone...and as he ordered a second, it must have been damn good!  All three of us had the special.  The ribeye was well cooked and flavorful, the corn on the cob was a bit plain, but that's A-OK with me.  The potato salad was super fresh, very cold and quite tasty.  Then there were the baked beans.  WOW!  I could make a meal of these alone!  (Gonna ask for the recipe, for sure!)  Mom ordered the brownie a la mode for dessert for the three of us to share.  Personally, I was so full, i would have gladly skipped - but good thing I didn't!  The ice cream, caramel and chocolate sauces were good - but the brownie itself was perfect!  I complain about the portion sizes only because it limits what I can try on one visit.  If there for happy hour, one app per person makes sense - more than that is too much food.  If for dinner, and all members of the party are getting entrees, best to skip apps completely.  Really - one dessert should not have put three people over the edge of too full!  Service has always been prompt and professional and I will be back again and again as long as they keep up this level of service and quality! (Even more often if they want to hire me as a bartender!!) :)  Oh - and the fact they use the picture I took of Take Bethany Home when advertising it on facebook makes me feel VERY loved! :)

Thank you, Yelp!   I needed a handyman to do some work at my new house (install doggie door, hang a high bookshelf, connect my gas dryer, etc.) I did a search here and found Mike at Copper State.   He responded quickly to my initial email, we set up an appointment and he was a few minutes early! (I've learned to expect appointments to run late in this town.) He is very personable, INCREDIBLY knowledgeable, and I felt confident I could trust him with my home.  I've already started compiling the list of other projects I plan to hire Copper State for, and was very comfortable passing along his name and contact information to a friend who put out the call asking if anyone knew a trustworthy, honest handyman. Will continue to highly recommend Mike for any home related project!

What a great time! A friend spotted a Living Social deal - and decided to organize a girls night. So much fun! We all met up for dinner, and headed here with beer and wine and desire to laugh and make art. Mission accomplished! I had been hesitating to go to one of these places - at is seems you have to paint the one picture they give you on that night, Here, there was a book with about 30 selections to choose from - and some of the women painted things they found online. The instructor was friendly and helpful - offered tips, suggestions and as much or as little guidance as each person wanted. She was also accommodating that I wanted to completely change the color scheme of the painting I chose. All in all - great night, lots of laughs, new friends, stronger bonds with old friends - and a really cute souvenir or the night to hang on my wall. Great concept - great place, looking forward to doing it again!

Consistently some of the best Cajun seafood in the Phoenix area!  The food is always fresh and flavorful, service has been consistently top notch and there's something I adore about how incongruous it is to have an amazing tiny little Cajun seafood joint in the corner of a casino floor.  The awards Ocean Trails consistently receives are well deserved. And if there is a wait for seating, it is worth it!

This place owes me money! I mean, serious kickbacks!  I learned of Sweeties at the fantastic Yelp event at Ft. McDowell Adventures in March. I ate a candy, grabbed a bag of candy, and won a $10 gift card in their "Plinko"-esque game. Since I rarely make the trip to the east Valley, and I don't each much candy, I gave the gift card to a coworker. She came to work the next week, glassy eyed and sugar rushed and sharing candy left and right! She admitted she was overwhelmed upon walking in - she really had no idea there could be so much candy in once place. Yeah. She's right. The place is HUGE. And overwhelming. And So.Much.Fun! It's impossible not to be in a good mood here - and it's impossible to only buy what you were planning when you came in. Well, the first coworker I sent in now makes Sweeties a regular part of her shopping routing. She told another gal at work who lives in Anthem. (I didn't tell her about it, or give her the gift card - as Anthem is just so far!) Well, last weekend my coworker who lives way up north happened to make a trek to the east part of town. And happened to add Sweeties to her list of stops. While in sugary nirvana, someone called her name. Yup - it was the other coworker - the one I first told about Sweeties in March. I think she lives in there now.   So - thanks to Yelp  - not only have I found a sugary place of goodness, I have turned at least one and possibly two coworkers into regular customers. Yeah - I want a finders' fee. I will keep sending people in, I will continue to enable and encourage addictions (including my own from time to time), and Sweeties can pay me off in future dental work! So worth it!

This was our final restaurant destination for Fall Restaurant Week. So glad we chose this place!  Start with a pint of Kiltlifter (always a good place to start!) Step-dad and I ordered identically down the option list.  Habanero duck tacos - Delish! Torta burger - OMG, they need to add this to the menu! At any price! It had EVERYTHING on it - and was all top quality and delicious! It was far too big, though. I ate my way through as much of it as I could, but still left plenty of goodies and both halves of the challah bun on the table. I only ate a third of my tots! (And they were really good tots!) Dessert was super decadent with chocolate cake and a salted caramel ice cream - I took most of the cake home for the next day.  Lovely patio, impressive tequila selection, attentive service and not as 'stuck up' as I expected it to be, as it's in the Phoenician.  There's also an impressive daily happy hour - which I will definitely be back for!

I was planning on going in to check the place out a few weeks ago - with friends that spent the day moving.  (Pizza is the universal moving food, right?)  I checked out the website - and seeing the photos and menu, it didn't seem "Casual" as the sign outside indicated.   At least not casual enough for people who smelled like they'd spent the day moving.  In August.  In Phoenix.  So, we went somewhere else. I forgot all about it until I spoke with my friend Kim T (See first review) today. Next thing I know, I am hungry.  My friend who lives close has to go to work, leaving her husband loaded on pain pills for a bad back and two children at home.  Happy hour seems perfect...LoopyMan doesn't have to consider how to do feed himself and the squatlings - and the kids get pizza.  Perfect! We walk in, and Maria (the co-owner) immediately thinks she recognizes me and I have been in before.  I assured her it must have been my evil twin, and we ask about happy hour.  The food special is $3.00 of all pizzas, and several drink specials.  (I didn't pay much attention to drink specials - as my limit was one.  I was driving and responsible for getting children home safely...call it my one bow to responsibility.)  We are told happy hour can be at the bar or at the pizza bar.  We opt for the pizza bar. While all one room, the place has three distinct areas.  Bar, dining room, pizza bar.  All are immaculate.  Had it been regular happy hour with adults, I would have opted for the bar.  Had it been a real sit down dinner, definitely the dining room.  For our purpose - the pizza bar was perfect - and of course, meant we could watch the pizza being made. Kim T was not exaggerating at all!  The kids were treated SO well.  The happy man (Gasper himself!) was making the pizzas, and friendly as could be.  He offered the kids pizza dough to play with!  It was amazing!  For all intents and purposes, it's play dough - and they were quite wrapped up creating animals and objects to entertain us with.  Better than an activity placemat and blue crayon any day! I asked LoopyMan what the kids liked on their pizza - pepperoni, of course.  Gasper's does not have pepperoni.  The closest option was the Vesuvio Pizza with Italian Hot Salami and Italian Hot Capicolla.  I asked Gasper how spicy it was...these are children after all.  He gave them each a piece to try, and it was thumbs up across the board.  I judge pizza at it's most basic, so we also ordered the Margherita. Both were fantastic...and it's been decided when I make pizza at home, fresh salami and capicolla will permanently replace pepperoni.  It was AMAZING! Our waitress (Josephine, a real gem!) came by to suggest dessert - which we were going to pass on.  Then Maria approached and started telling us about the cream puff.  She personally makes them (the pride shows!), told me how wonderful they are, and assured me once I try her cream puff, I will never miss a canolli again.  It was also supposedly large enough to share.  How can I resist at that point? Well, she was correct across the board.  Huge and delicious!  Breakdown -   3 soft drinks, 1 well cocktail, 2 pizzas, 1 dessert big enough to share - under $40.00.  (A $6 dollar savings on the happy hour pizzas)  Great food, lovely setting, spectacular service and made to feel like welcome family members - priceless!  Two children that were entertained and fed and happy - we will absolutely be back!  Can't wait to try it again for dinner - checking out the menu, there's a LOT I want to try...and based on Kim's review of the osso bucco, I will be in sooner rather than later!

A co-worker mentioned she was craving hot dogs - because I had taken her for really good ones the week before. Unfortunately, we were limited on time, and the really good ones were too far. I pass Jimmy's every day on my way to work and it's close to the office, so we decided to check it out . A few Yelp friends I trust have given great reviews - so why not? Sigh. What a difference a few years can make.  I was really hungry, so I did power through my brat. After the first bite, I mentioned that my first impression was not bad, but it's not as good as the other place. It will go in a pinch. By my last bite, I told my coworker if she ever wanted to go back, she could do it without me.  The mozzarella sticks were the cheap frozen kind, with the thick crappy breading and the chemical aftertaste. My brat was gray and tasteless. Gray. And served on French bread. Cheap commercial French bread. You know, the kind with no crunch in the crust. Rubbery. My coworker said generic grocery store hot dogs have more flavor than hers did.  I can only assume they changed their product line in the last few years. I will take for granted they were good when my friends were there, and attempts at cost cutting have destroyed the product quality. Otherwise, I would have to assume my trusted friends have terrible taste in hot dogs, and reconsider how much I can trust their dining opinions.  The safest bet will be to keep the friends, and skip Jimmy's from here on out.

There are a lot of things to like about Joe's. The food is fresh and tasty. Prices are quite reasonable. The coffee ROCKS! The diner/greasy spoon vibe is comfortable. The servers are fast, friendly and competent. And I can walk there from my house!  Now - if I could just get a better appreciation for breakfast. (Haven't tried the lunches yet...)

I've been a regular here for several years. Maybe it's because I am a recognized face, maybe it's because I always tip well - but I don't wait for service - EVER.  That said...maybe it's because I am "known" here - the massage chairs have always worked for me - and I have been in all of them at some point or another. I usually get a pedicure and brow wax - and have been happy with the results almost every time.  On the couple of occasions I've received a less than stellar pedi, I've gone back within the next couple days and they make it right. (Whether it's better cuticle trimming, more thorough callous removal or a new paint job.) I can't ask for much more than that!

Not much add that the other reviewers haven't touched on.  I went in tonight with Kim T. to talk about the upcoming Great Cajun Cookoff and Food Fest.  Knowing the Southern influence of the menu, we figured it would be appropriate to have a drink and an appetizer while pouring over the details. Ambience - Love this room!  Open but not loud, very communal and comfortable.  The devil is in the details - and BT didn't miss a step anywhere! Service -  Was flawless - thank you, Court!  This man knows the food and was great with suggestions! Drink - Kim and I each had a Miss Katie's Pimm's Cup.  While I love ginger and cucumber together, I rarely order a Pimm's Cup, as I am not a fan of gin.  Miss Katie's is made with vodka - problem solved!  The only issue with this cocktail is that it goes down WAY too easy.  This drink could get me into a whole lotta trouble!  (Bring it on!!)  I asked Miss Katie if they carried Abita Beer (one of our favorites, from southern Louisiana).  She wasn't sure off the top of her head if they had it in or not, but was going to check.  She came back a few minutes later with a bottle of Abita Amber and 2 frosty pint glasses - poured the bottle into the glasses for us to split and offered it to us, gratis!  Now - THAT is beyond service!  I've been to restaurants that offered an amuse bouche - but never one with an amuse beer! :)  Food - Looking at the menu, we decided not to split an appetizer.  Instead, we'd split an appetizer, a side and a dessert!   The bread basket came with 2 fresh rolls with cheese, and one dark wheat roll - side of honey butter.  While they were fresh and hot and tasty, I really can't comment on the butter, as we never touched it - or the bread on its own, as we used it to soak up the mustard jus from the grits and sausage appetizer.... I heard great things about the grits and andouille sausage  appetizer - but was not expecting this level of amazing flavor.  I've never really liked grits and couldn't understand why people did.  Now I do!  Turns out, I'd never had them made well.  As Kim put it, they should be so rich you can hardly eat them.  (And they were!)  Not just andouille sausuage, either - there was also hot Italian sausage and a southwest chicken sausage - all from Schreiner's.  (Yay for supporting other local businesses!) While I wasn't completely sold, Kim was stuck on the bacon and cheddar biscuits.  But, what the heck.  I like biscuits, I like cheddar and I love bacon - hard to make a misstep on this one, right?  They're served with an apple butter, which Court strongly urged us to use.  He was right!  WOW!  I think I may start craving these on a very regular basis! For dessert, I could not choose.  Brioche bread pudding is on the menu.  I LOVE bread pudding.  That's one of my all time weakness foods.  The fig and pecan pie sounded really good, as did Death By Chocolate.  I asked Kim to choose...and she made it easy - we should make the meal a pork trifecta and have the BACON S'mores!  (Yes, that's my picture of them..)YOWZA!  Chocolate covered bacon, housemade marshmallow, graham crackers and peanut butter cream.  The dish is so wrong on so many levels that it turns the corner and ends up being very, VERY right!   While it's bad business to suggest skipping an entree - and there are SEVERAL I look forward to trying - the other reviewers comments about large portions are dead on.  Granted, we started late and neither of us were super hungry - but the shared appetizer, side and dessert really was plenty for us and we left feeling full.  Had an entree been involved, there would have been leftovers, or - worse - no dessert!  Amazing place...what a great add for top notch places in the Valley!  Casual enough for everyday meals, but quality and style to impress the out of towners, too!  Beckett's Table - you are my new go-to!

Ahhh, Roach Coach - how far we've come! These days, Phoenix is finally starting to get the hint that GOOD food on mobile trucks can work - and work well!  My first introduction to Jamburritos was at the Great Cajun Cookoff and Food Fest.  I would have written about the gumbo - but as I was on the planning committee for the event, thought it would be a conflict of interest.  And, by the time things slowed down enough for me to actually eat that day, only a handful of the restaurants still had food.  I didn't want to skip kudos to a great place just becuase I was too slow in getting there.  That said...the experience I had that day was certainly good enough to get my attention.  I "liked" them on Facebook and have had a great lunch with them that past 2 days.  I saw the Facebook update that the truck would be at the Ford dealership on Camelback  yesterday and today.  I made plans with Kim T to meet for lunch today...but I couldn't wait!  Yesterday I tried the special - 2 catfish po boy sliders.  Nice fresh rolls, perfect remoulade, shredded lettuce, 2 good sized cornmeal breaded catfish filets fried to perfection and a dollop of black bean salsa.  YUM!  Adding hot sauce made it perfect.  The only problem (which I was sure to share with them today), I took the platter home, left it on the table for just a minute to get a drink...and my dog Layla stole one of the catfish filets!  So - not Jamburritos fault at all, but I was left a bit hungry.  Today I met Kim T.  She had the K-sadilla with fried eggplant, I had the steak jamburrito.  We were both happy campers!  Her K-sadilla was enormous, and had to be eaten with a fork.  There was just so much good stuff in there, the tortilla never could have held up!  The steak jamburrito was HUGE, and filled with chopped steak, slices of andouille sausage, rice, beans, cabbage and cheese.  Every bite was amazing...but did I mention it was HUGE?  It's seven hours later, and I am not even interested in dinner.  Prices are VERY low for the quality and quantity of food received.  Yesterday's special was $3.99, the highest on the menu, I believe, is $6.99.  I could be wrong about that...it may be the $5.99, which was the price of my burrito.    Fresh, hot, delicious food and WONDERFUL people in the truck! Mark Brown, the owner, came out to chat with us - before we even got our food, we were made to feel like family.  (Meant in the good way!)  Definitely worth finding on Facebook or following on Twitter to see where they'll be serving up next!

Great selection, great displays, friendly staff and, well, CANDY!  I won a couple gift cards from here, and brought in my mom and her husband after we had lunch at Monti's. I thought the visit would be primarily for him - as he loves candy. And I was prepared to use part of my gift card funds to buy him a candy or two. Then mom found the sugar free wall.  And went nuts. All of my gift money, plus some of her husband's cash to cover her haul.  Granted, I have just had a couple pieces of the salt water taffy - and appreciated the variety of bacon candy they have. Because, you know, everything is better with bacon. Overall, I am not a huge candy fan.   But this store does it right, and when I'm in the area and in the mood, you can bet I'll be here!

I've been debating for a long time on whether or not it's appropriate for me to write a review. Full disclosure - my family has been close to the Combs' for decades - and it has gone well beyond the mechanic/customer relationship.  So - while my review is completely honest based on my experience - I can't seperate professional feelings from personal feelings.  Please take that for what it's worth.  My dad started taking his car and his work trucks to the old Combs location at Scottsdale Rd and Shea.  Based on the relationship he built with the people there, he and my mom were invited to not only the groundbreaking at the current Adobe Dr. location, but attended the wedding of Eric, the GM.  (Side note - before getting married, my dad hoped I would end up dating Eric - I only share this because it speaks to his honesty, integrity and work ethic.  If this is the type of man a father WANTS to see his daughter with, you know he's the type of man you can trust!)  By the time I went to work with my dad, all services had been moved to the new location.  And it was a given that the fleet of work trucks, as well as both my parents cars and my car would get all service and repairs with them.  They are not cheap, but they are HONEST.  Always!  Honest, even when it costs them money.  They aren't out to con you into services you don't need - they want to develop a relationship and take care of all your vehicles for as long as you own them.  They don't need to make a fast buck today, beause they are building the trust that you won't want to let anyone else under your hood.  I could go on for days with specific anecdotes relating to the honesty, integrity and good business practices they've displayed through the years - as well as the good humor and warmth of everyone I've encountered - but the other reviewers have done a good job of that.  Instead - I will tell you about a phone call I made today.  I called Combs', and got Leo on the phone.  While I did have a car related question to ask him - I was thrilled to have the excuse to call, and promised to bake cookies to bring in to the shop.  That's right.  My experience with Combs' Auto is SO good that I am baking and delivering cookies - and there's nothing wrong with my car!  Of all the businesses in this town, this is the one I feel 100% comfortable sending people to for any auto repair need.  It's the one I know I will be thanked for instead of cursed.

I really thought I had done a review for Park Avenue before - but it looks like instead of writing an update, this will be the initial review.  I've been in four times now - and each has been a positive experience.  I will share here what I shared with Holli (the owner) on my last visit (about a week ago): I can't stand the color scheme. Sorry, I am just not a girlie-girl - pink and orange are two of my least favorite colors out there. Bright and happy colors make me feel neither. It's further from my house than the two big name competitors in the blow out business here in town. In fact, one of the others is right around the corner from me, and I really like their decor. It's pricier than either of the competitors. And it's the only one I go to. Why? How I am treated. When I walk in, I am greeted with a smile and friendliness. I am offered a drink. If the stylist I am scheduled with is running even a little late, apologies are extended offers are made for magazines and I am treated as though I am incredibly valued. Every time.  I see by other reviews here that not everyone has had the same experience - but from what I've seen when in the salon, every effort is made to accommodate every request from every person who calls or walks in. My experience - both in how I'm treated as well as how I've seen every other client treated has been on point across the board.  Thank you, Holli and team - for not only giving my hair a chance to be beautifully blown out every now and again, but for making me feel like one of those shampoo commercial girls when I walk out!

It was the waiter's last day - which he was quite happy to tell us all about. Because of that - I will not write anything about the service. He definitely had a case of last-day-itis. A friend and I had just created paintings of our pooches at a nearby storefront - and we were ready for a late lunch. First thought was the restaurant next door to BLD - as we've both enjoyed their other location and I am friendly with the GM. It was BUSY in there, and we were told it would be about 45 minutes for a table. We were both quite hungry, and didn't want to wait that long to be able to first order. So - we went to BLD. It was close to empty. That should have been a sign. When one place has a 45 minute wait, and another restaurant that shares the parking lot only has customers at two tables - there's a reason. A reason we should have heeded. We opted to share a couple of dishes. One was the seared peppered tuna salad. (The abbreviation "R.R.P." shows up throughout the menu. I asked so you don't have to - it's Roasted Red Peppers.) The chef wasn't as familiar with the concept of "seared" as I hoped, the tuna was quite well done. A couple of slices had a hint of pink in the center...but just a hint - and definitely not what I know to be seared. We also shared the grilled cheese sandwich. The menu describes it as thick cut sourdough with Havarti, brie, tomato, and bacon. Sounds delicious, right? Too bad the execution was soggy and bland. The fries were okay. I guess that's something. There was also a happy hour menu. One of the appetizers we asked for was house made chips with hot sauce and blue cheese. (The restaurant we first went to, but was too busy, has something like this that we both love - that's one of the reasons we wanted to go there.) Not only was it completely lackluster - but I mention the appetizer after the entrée, as that's when it showed up. I don't see any reason I need to give this place a second shot. I'm rarely in this part of town, and now I know that when I am, I will just go to the other place - and no matter how long the wait is, the food will be good.

One of my roommates was extolling the beauty of Bosa.  I asked if they were as good as Rainbow, but she had never tried Rainbow.  So - we decided to do a taste test.  Three of us in the house - so we would get 3 different (but like) donuts from each.  The plan was to bring them back home, cut to sample size, and note flavor, texture and overall preference.  The guy roommate's favorite is glazed raised.  The gal leans to sugar raised and I figured glazed old fashioned is a safe baseline for taste testing.  We went to Rainbow first.  No problem getting the donuts we wanted.  I also picked up a half dozen donut holes.  Was not thrilled to be charged $0.50 for the box, but c'est la vie.  Girl roommate also got a watermelon frappe type of drink.  A bit sweet for my tastes, but very, very watermelony.  Next stop Bosa.  They didn't have regular sugar raised - used powdered sugar instead.  (I have a hard time trusting that the regular sugar didn't stick - somehow they managed to make it work at Rainbow!)  So the granulated vs. powdered sugar raised would not be as scientific a comparison, but we'd make do.  No problem with the glzed and old fashioned.  We also picked up ham and swiss croissants.  One can never have too much pastry, right? :)  Results -       Glazed raised - Bosa was slightly denser and chewier - more mouth satisfaction.  Rainbow was cloudlike fluffy and light.  Great texture, but we didn't feel satisfied from chewing.  Rainbow was slightly sweeter.           ~Votes - 3 for Bosa.~      Old Fashioned - textures were identical.  Rainbow had a slight lemon (or maybe aspatrame?) flavor in the back end of the tasting.           ~Votes - 1 slight lean to Bosa, 2 Draw~      Sugar raised - texture of donut was identical to glazed raised above.  (duh - same donut, different topping.)  The gal roomie likes granulated.  The guy roomie preferred the powdered.  I liked both.           ~Votes - 1 Bosa, 1 Rainbow, 1 Draw.  So, Bosa comes out with a slight edge.  And we came out with a slight sugar rush.  I can't help but wonder what our next scientific food research challenge will be!

Sunday night, and I can't decide between Mongolian BBQ and sushi.  My stomach and taste buds were at an impasse.  Happily, I'd read the early reviews for Red Wok, and realized I could have both for one low price!  (Dinner $9.99, soft drink $1.50)  Granted - I had VERY few of the buffet offerings, so this review is quite limited.    Since the place has only been open a month, it's still really clean and fresh.  Some attention was paid to decor (wall treatments and lighting), and is well laid out.  Employees were constantly cleaning and replacing food trays, so it's nice to know that freshness is considered here.  (Not the case in several of the places I've been.)  The sushi selection was actually better than I'd anticipated.  Shrimp, salmon, tuna and yellowtail nigiri, tuna and yellowtail sashimi, and various rolls (most of which having the typical California or spicy tuna base.)  It was all cold and fresh and clearly recently prepared.    The Mongolian BBQ area was sufficient, if not impressive.  The veggies were all very fresh, the meats were cold and fresh, but not frozen as I've grown used to seeing.  Relatively slim sauce selection - but I was quite happy with my concoction.  From the regular buffet line, I did have a couple coconut prawns (decent flavor, good texture), a couple pieces of spicy chicken (meh)and some green veggie that wasn't broccoli rabe and wasn't bok choi, but something in that general family and quite well prepared (YUM).  I also tried a steamed BBQ pork bun.  That was the only disappointment - the texture was right, but it was tasteless.  I've never been thrilled with Chinese buffet desserts, though the ice cream case with assorted toppings is a step in the right direction.  I stuck with fresh watermelon, cantaloupe and honeydew for my sweet needs.    I'm sure I'll be back - and plan to try more of the offerings - but can see myself getting stuck in the sushi and Mongolian BBQ habit.

3.5 stars, rounding up.  I joined the special $15/month for unlimited super duper special cleans. I like the speed and convenience, I like the free vacuums.  Not thrilled that the dryers don't dry off the back of the car.   Easy enough lesson  - I now bring a towel and glass cleaner so I can finish drying the car and shiny up the windows.  So far, I have been taking great care of the new car and washing it weekly - but even if I slack off and only do it twice a month, it's still a great value.

I sleep with strangers!  On the new client paperwork, there is a section for potential side effects. They include deep relaxation, sleep and snoring. And yes, I have fallen asleep there more than once.  This place is amazing!  I had it bookmarked for awhile - but a few weeks back, my neck was killing me, and it seems chiropractors are closed on Thursdays. Luckily, I remembered I had seen great reviews here, so I called them and they had me come in right away. The improvement after just one session was incredible! (Almost in tears on the way in, barely sore on the way out!) It was suggested I come 2 or 3 times a week for a couple of weeks, just because the pain had been so bad. That was several weeks ago - and I am still going at least once or twice a week. Now it's not for pain, but vitality. I feel healthier overall. Maybe it's purely from taking the time to shut out the outside world, focus on breathing and truly relax - which I rarely take the time to do on my own. Or maybe it's because thousands of years of this healing practice suggests it's not snake oil. No matter what it is - it's working!  Mayo and Nicole (the 2 acupuncturists) both have a very calming presence and gentle touch. And the sliding scale of $15 - $35 per visit make it accessible and affordable for the masses. (No income check - you pay what you feel you can.) There's a $10 new patient set up fee, but that is waived if you get a referral card from an existing client/patient/customer (not sure which is correct in this case.) The feeling of calm and serenity in the treatment room is notable, and I find myself looking forward to the next appointment, knowing how refreshed and healthy I'll feel afterward.  Such a fantastic business!

How did it take me so long to get here? Great place to see a show, or just stop in for a bite to eat and a drink.  I came for a show - we got a table near the front. Acoustics were good, drinks were fairly priced (I can't gripe about $5/pint anywhere - at a show, it's great!), and the staff were friendly.  Tip - one block west of the venue has no parking meters!  It was a fantastic night out with a great group of women - and I will definitely be back - this is a great little venue!

I'd heard about Paletas Betty around the time they opened on Mill. I remember suggesting to a coworker we head there for dessert next time we're in Tempe for dinner.  And then forgot.  In February, at the Yelp Treasure Hunt for Local Love, Betty was one of the participating businesses.  Yay! A chance to check them out! Oh, and extra points in the game for a receipt from a participating business? Perfect! Now I *have* to get a paleta!  And I have been back several times since.  Sadly, dairy is not my friend - so I haven't been able to check out the majority of what's available.  But - OMG - pineapple con chili!  Non dairy, amazing pineapple and just enough chili powder mixed in to give off some happy heat.  I could eat this daily!  Everyone I have brought in has tried something different - and everyone has loved whatever flavor they've gotten.  FANTASTIC!

Fried.Alligator.Tail.  That's really all I have to say for now. Full disclosure - I have not been to Barney's yet. I was part of an event where they were serving up their gator - and it was GOOD. Go back for seconds and thirds good!  So good - that I am posting a 4 star review based on tasting one appetizer at what was ostensibly a catered event. Sure - an visit to the actual restaurant/bar may require an update up or down - but for today, I am craving some tail!  So - an open call to my friends - let's hit up a Saturday or Sunday long and lazy lunch at the Boathouse!  You in?

Yum! A girlfriend and I planned a lunch date for Tuesday. Not too sure where we were meeting, but I noticed she commented on Luncha Libre's facebook page that morning. They were set to be across the street from her office, so we decided that would be a perfect little lunch. She ordered the papaverde (potato and green chile) quesadilla and I had the grilled chicken - with the plan to share so we could try both.  We both inhaled our food so quickly we forgot the sharing plan! She said hers was fantastic, and I am enamored with the citrus marinated chicken. Portions were a bit smaller than I was expecting for the $8.50, but the quality is definitely there! I also ordered the honey vanilla iced tea (served in mason jar for $4.00, but with $1.00 off if I bring the jar back for refills) - it was subtle and delicious!  Definitely a nice add to the food truck scene - I look forward to trying more of their offerings!

The gyros are fine for take-out. I'd been meaning to check this place out since I moved into the neighborhood about two years ago. It didn't happen until a visiting friend had ordered for delivery. We each had a gyro, and split a salad. It wasn't the best gyro I've ever had, but it was perfectly decent and satiated the craving. He apparently ordered from here again the following week while I was at work - and had a less than stellar experience with the woman on the phone. Abusive was the term he kept using. What he described was in line with what many of the other reviewers here have shared. I was recently craving gyro, so I decided to drive there and place a take-out order. The place is small. The two people working were not at all friendly or happy to see me come in. Also, in no big hurry to approach me to take my order. The man who finally took my order seemed positively stressed that I was ordering a gyro AND a salad. The woman was on the phone with a customer - and I wouldn't necessarily assume she was abusive - just very impatient and having issues with the language barrier. Had I not been raised around a bunch of immigrants and New Yorkers, I may call it abusive, but I guess I have a higher tolerance than some. Still - I did not get any warm and fuzzy feelings while in here, and got no sense of being a valued customer at all. The food itself was fine. The tzatziki is a little light on cucumber for my taste, but that's just my preference. The meat was juicy, the pita fresh. The small Greek salad was fine, too. Plenty of olives and feta. I will probably eat here again - as there aren't a whole lot of options for gyros so close to home. I'll just remind myself it's for a decent meal for $10, not for the people or service.

I really am a fan of conveyor sushi. Being able to get my raw fish fix and be stuffed in the $20 range just isn't something I can do at a "real" sushi house. And it is nice to have small plates for the ability to have a wider sampling of rolls and nigiri. Seaweed salad, tai (red snapper), tuna, salmon, several rolls, and the deep fried jalapenos (not authentic...but SO yummy!) and an iced green tea. Stuffed for the rest of the day, and didn't break the budget. Gotta love that! I've been to this location a couple of times - my house is just about mid-point between here and Teharu in Chandler - and I'll continue to alternate between the two. Granted, it's not the best sushi around. Fresh, but not the super top notch quality I've been spoiled with. Given the volume, it can't help but be corporate in assembly and have a general cafeteria feel.

As you can tell from the pictures here, Aesir Metalwyrks has tremendous talent and vision when it comes to gorgeous and functional helms.  People trust their very lives to these pieces, so the quality and durability is the most important part - but the artistic touches make these truly amazing!  If you're a fighter in the SCA (or are close to one) and live in the Southwest, you probably already know Dave Demers and Aesir - so there's nothing new I can share here.  If you're not a fighter or don't even know what the SCA is, this is still a business to know and keep in mind!  A fan of Roger Clyne and the Peacemakers?  Check out their site for the logo trailer hitches.  Those were produced by Aesir, too!  If it's custom metal and you want it done, this is THE place to go!  No order too big or small, fantastic customer service and AMAZING quality product.  Tell Dave I sent you!

Brought my sister here for a late night snack when she got into town for the weekend. Figured a cocktail and small plates would be the way to go. Happily, she agreed! We each had an amazing martini, and we split the soup dumplings, wings and short ribs.  The wings are okay, I had no problems at all with them - but the dumplings and short ribs were phenomenal! I think I am older and more boring than the target demographic - or maybe it's just because it was after 10 on a Friday night - but the DJ was LOUD. We could barely carry on a conversation, and my head was pounding by the time we left. I'll definitely be back - and love the idea of reverse happy hour - so I am thinking I'll aim for during the week next time. The food and drink list are definitely worth repeat visits - and there are still LOTS of things I'd like to try.

Final dinner with my roommate and my best friend to cap off her New Year's visit.  And what a good choice!  For starters - how can I not adore the concept of picking up amazing food and a bottle of wine or growler or beer from a drive-thru if so desired? Admittedly super lazy, sometimes I want good food, but don't want to give up the comfort of my slippers to get it. Federal is the perfect solution!  The roommate and I shared the corn coin appetizer - not bad at all, but I think it would have been amazing if prepared more elote style. Next time I'll get the beets or sprouts instead. We also decided to split one of the pizzas. With MJ Bread responsible for the dough and Schreiner's doing the sausage, no big surprise that it was a hit! (And doing fresh grated parm from the big block directly onto the pie was a nice touch that makes a big difference to this girl!)  Also ordered was the roasted veggie board - with sprouts instead of potatoes. It was big and beautiful and super tasty! I suggest this for any celiac, vegetarian, vegan or anyone who likes amazing veggies and every combination thereof! HUGE winner in this dish!  As DD, I was sticking with iced tea - but look forward to exploring some of the beers and checking out a couple of their wine coolers.  And getting that veggie board again!

A friend and I made lunch plans for today, she suggested we come here. So glad we did!  I had the BBQ Bacon Burger, medium rare, with fries. She had the special - Southwest burger, with chorizo.  The bacon was perfect! I should have asked whose bacon they use - this is the stuff I want at home. So meaty and perfect and thick and full of bacony goodness. The cheddar was melted to perfection - with crispy parts where it hit the grill. Few things get me giddy like the crunchy cheese! The onion ring was a happy touch. Burger itself well prepared and flavorful and the bun was super fresh.  The fries were good - but the burgers were large enough that even with the two of us sharing my fries, most were left on the plate.  I'll definitely be back - happy to have this place so close to home!

Norm R. sent me an email back in May suggesting I check this place out. Since it's in my neighborhood, I'd been driving by and waiting for it to open.  I was able to get in the first time in June. We stopped in for a snack (my cousin had just arrived from NYC and was hungry - but we didn't want to eat too much, as we had dinner reservations in a few hours.)  We did a fair sampling of the menu. My cousin had enchiladas, I had tacos, and my sister had a salad. I honestly don't remember who had which protein in which dish - but between the three of us, we had a nice variety.  All of us were content with what we had, and none of us had a difficult time navigating the menu.  Everything was fresh and tasty. Not the most amazing food I've ever had - but it's quick, fresh and affordable. And I think it's a few steps above Chipotle in both flavor and personality.  I've been in a couple times since then, and have always been happy with my selection. The food always hits the spot.  Good stuff! Just hoping they expand to soups - plural. I'd like to see more than chicken tortilla offered.

One of the best ways to see how a business is run is when things go wrong. It's easy to be great when everything is right, but when there's a snag, it's too easy for things to fall apart. The last visit I made to Gertrude's gave me a great picture of the way the staff makes sure things stay right. Three of us went in Easter morning for a snack. None of us were hungry enough for a full meal, but wanted something. We each had the fresh lemonade with herbs and berries (I am not generally a fan of lemonade, but this was fantastic), and decided to share the special of hot cross buns with cinnamon butter and the garden frittata. The room is casual and comfortable, with a fantastic patio. The food was fresh, well prepared and beautifully presented. Our server was attentive and had a great personality. I thought the prices were high for the quantity served, but much like resort dining, you are paying for the location. I wanted to treat the gals to our snack, so I slipped the server my debit card. All was well until he brought the check. It wasn't the card receipt for me to sign, it was the check. I reminded him about my card, he acknowledged and walked away. A few minutes later, the manager came over. It seems my card was misplaced. She gave me her business card, apologized, comped the bill and was taking down my contact information when the server came back - having found my card. Naturally, I was relieved. I was also surprised and impressed that they still insisted on not charging us for the meal.  With how promptly and professionally it was handled, and the great customer service that was shown - in addition to the fact I thoroughly enjoyed all I ate and drank while there - I will definitely be back - probably every time I go to the Garden!

Bad news. VERY bad news. A friend sent me a text last week that this location opened. When the only Louisiana Fried Chicken in town was on Baseline, it was far enough to avoid. I had to REALLY be craving fried chicken to get down there. But 40th St. and Thomas?  That's too close! I gained 5 pounds reading the damn text!  I went in today - got a 3 piece combo (comes with 2 small sides, a roll and a drink) for lunch at work today and an 8 piece combo (with 2 large sides and 6 rolls) for the house.  LOVE THIS CHICKEN!!  As the reviewer before me pointed out - these are not huge pieces of chicken. They are average, normal, what size chickens are supposed to be pieces of chicken. And the batter has AMAZING flavor!  The menu board lists all the available sides - some for slightly extra - but all quite tasty. Not just fried chicken! They are also grilling the chicken, and have shrimp and fish options as well.  It's not the cheapest in town, and there are some full service restaurants around that may do the chicken better (I would still choose LoLo's or Tuck Shop for chicken and waffle over LFC's chicken and waffle) - but as far as fast food fried chicken goes - LFC is worlds better than KFC, Popeye's or Church's.  It's fantastic that there's now a Louisiana Fried Chicken so close to my place - but now I have to learn will power - and FAST!  Aside - I am sure this will be changing - but right now, the place is still really new. All the equipment is clean and shiny - and the walls are still bare. Hoping they get some stuff up on the walls. Louisiana stuff, chicken stuff, paintings of fruit...whatever!

The 3000 Club is a charitable organization with a program called Market on the Move.  Distribution sites all over town (predominantly schools and churches) on Saturday mornings. A $10 donation will yield up to 60 lbs of produce!  I heard they are winding down for the summer - instead of being all over town, it will be in the air conditioned warehouse near I-17 and Rose Garden Lane. There's still a couple weeks of regular distribution - and I look forward to them getting back out this fall! See website for schedule and distribution locations.  https://the3000club.org/index.php?option=com_jevents&view=cat&task=cat.listevents&Itemid=89  I went to the downtown market Saturday morning. Handed over my $10, and was told to help myself to cases of Nestle bottled water. The offerings at this week's market included melon, acorn and banana squash, zucchini, cucumber, green and yellow peppers and grape tomatoes. I didn't take close to the 60 pounds I could have - and still have way more than enough for my house - so my coworkers get lucky with produce this week!  Love what they're doing here - and, as I have never had acorn squash before, love the fact I am pushing out of my culinary comfort zone and allowing myself the opportunity to learn some new kitchen tricks!

Yay, Phoestivus!  I made it for the second week, and from what I hear, it was notably more crowded. I didn't end up eating - the lines to the food trucks were all pretty long.  However - did I power shop! Lots of gifts for friends - and I splurged on me, too!  - A gluten free biscuit kit from Rise - A BUNCH (15!) fantastic chocolate bars from Stone Grindz - Several bracelets from Lotus and Lava  - Unfiltered raw local honey from Sun Valley Bees - Spicy pickled asparagus and red bell peppers from Pickled Perfection - An earring and necklace set from Michael William Mosaic Jewelry - An air plant in a a blue T-rex! (damn - forgot to jot down the name of the plant vendor!)  Free gift wrapping from Yelp and the awesome Rachael! (There was no tip jar, so I gave her one of the chocolate bars from Stone Grindz. She's so worth it!)  Had the crowds been a bit more manageable for me, I would have been there longer and likely bought more. My wallet is grateful that didn't happen!  Great music, festive atmosphere, and tons of local businesses all in one place. Awesome!

Mmmmm. Donuts.  I've stopped by a few times now, usually to treat my team at work.  My last visit was on National Donut Day. They had a buy 12, get 6 special. I could treat lots of coworkers! The donuts are consistently fresh and delicious. There's normally a HUGE selection. The staff has always been friendly and helpful.  This is a great little shop that seems to fly under the radar a bit - if you're nearby, it's well worth a stop to satiate your sweet tooth.  Mmmmm. Donuts.

Restaurant week dinner number 4.  I met a fellow Yelper here for dinner - we decided to go early, to get at least one drink and an appetizer from the happy hour menu. So happy to learn happy hour is every day, and honored through the entire restaurant, not just the bar!  The Brussels sprouts appetizer is amazing - I will start experimenting to replicate this at home. Quick fried shaved sprouts, tossed in agave with golden raisins and pecorino. Simple, but phenomenal!  The bone marrow crusted in bacon and gruyere was incredible and so rich and perfect.  The duck fat fries couldn't have been any better - serving them with the egg is brilliant!  The farm salad looked great - I'll probably get that next time.  I was a bit disappointed in the rotisserie pork. Nothing wrong with it - but not as good as when I make pork shoulder or picnic roast.  I am looking forward to coming back - the happy hour menu has a nice selection of $5 plates - and the cocktails are well thought out and well executed.

Spiders and crickets and ants...oh, my! Last summer, I sadly discovered my home had become a safe haven for all kinds of unwelcome creepy crawlies - and not a single one of them offered to pitch in toward rent or utilities! My dog also doesn't pitch in toward the bills, but she was invited - so I don't mind so much. I wanted the buggies gone and I wanted my pooch to stay safe and healthy. I asked friends, checked Yelp reviews, and called around a bit. I was entirely impressed with InsecTek from the first phone call. Professional, friendly, knowledgeable, and willing to work around my schedule. The first visit didn't happen as scheduled - it was pouring rain - and they can't spray the outdoors when it's raining. They called ahead of time, let me know, and rescheduled for a couple of days later. The morning of first service - and each service since then - InsecTek staff have been on time, presentable, friendly, communicative, and great with my dog! There is no more issue with the creepies and crawlies, my dog is healthy and happy, and I am thrilled I found InsecTek for my pest care needs Seriously - they should give seminars to other companies on providing great customer service. The fact they kill bugs as promised means they are doing their job. The way they have treated me - both on the phone and in person - that's what makes them a stellar company!

Restaurant week meal #1 for my stepfather and I. I appreciate how they decided to do it - instead of selecting from a limited menu of appetizer, entree and dessert, each person is served smaller portions of 3 apps, 2 entrees and 1 dessert. What a great way to sample what the kitchen can do!  Apps:  - Baked potato soup - fantastic! would definitely order it again! - Short rib with grilled pear, brussel sprouts and goat gouda salad with grilled lemon vinaigrette. The dressing was a bit too acidic - but a little tweak on that and this could be one of my favorite dishes in town! The flavor, texture, color and shape composition is spot on. One of the most well conceived apps I have seen in a long time. - Smoked turkey grilled cheese - meh. It wasn't bad...just bland and boring and nothing special at all.  Entrees: - Chicken and pumpkin pie waffles with egg and maple red eye gravy. I have been singing the praises of chicken and waffles for years. Now my stepfather is a convert, based on this dish. We did specifically ask to speak with the manager to beg this be added to the menu. Perfectly executed! - Smoked pork belly steak. (with bing cherry bbq sauce, swiss chard, guerro chile, leeks and white bean puree) It's pork belly. That's all you need to know. YUM.  Dessert: Cornbread pudding, chipotle huckleberry jam, bourbon caramel corn. Never would have considered this for a dessert if there were any other options. Luckily, there weren't. It was an out of left field amazing hit!  We were both pleased and impressed with the food quality, presentation and combinations.  There are a few service snags that need to be worked on, though. Flatware is wrapped in napkins, already on the table when seated. Fork and knife only. If it's decided most diners won't need a spoon, when you serve an appetizer that includes soup, please deliver a spoon WITH the food.  Once the soup was delivered and we realized we were spoonless, we were unable to catch the attention of any staff member, my stepfather had to approach the hostess for spoons. Our forks and knives were bussed away with our entree plates - our desserts were delivered with no forks. (I snagged two more napkin rolls from the empty table next to us so we could start dessert. About halfway though, the hostess came by with long forgotten forks for our dessert course.)  Nothing that would stop me from coming back. No dealbreakers at all - and I do look forward to coming back. Just time to work on some front of the house snags...  Still definitely a fan!

So far, two brunches here. And I look forward to adding to that number!  Visit one - with a pescatarian girlfriend.   We each had a coffee (tasty blend - good roast - FRESH!) and started by splitting the pancake of the day. I really don't remember what was in/on it...but it was divine. My friend claimed it was the best pancake of her life - and she's a pancake fiend! There were a couple of the benedicts that were jumping out at both of us - so we decided to split two of them. Turns out - Snooze is happy to split up the benedicts for anyone at anytime - so we didn't even have to agree on the two to share. Since there is so much goodness in each - I am just copying the details from the menu on the ones we had:  "Late Harvest Benny - Wilted Swiss chard, fennel and leeks served atop goat cheese and herb polenta cakes with poached Niman Ranch eggs, cream cheese hollandaise and toasted pine nut crumb." and "Upstream Benny - Honey Smoked Salmon tossed with cucumber and corn salsa and served over jalapeno-cream cheese spoonbread, topped with poached Niman Ranch eggs and cream cheese hollandaise" They were both absolutely phenomenal!  Visit two - with a male friend notorious for his appetite and food snobbery.  Since it worked so well the first time - I suggested we split the pancake of the day. Again - no memory of the crack they addled it with - but I could not stop - and I want to go back and get the daily pancake every day! I opted for the breakfast pot pie, and he had the sweet potato pancakes. Both were great - the puff pastry on the breakfast pot pie was absolutely perfectly executed. The pancakes weren't overly sweet - and the bits of ginger really made the dish shine!  There was a 20-30 minute wait each time - and both visits were intentionally planned to be around the "slower" times. I truly dislike waiting for a table - but Snooze, you make it so worth it!  See you soon!

No! No! No! No! (I could just end my review there.)  A friend was craving good New Mexican green chile and asked me for suggestions. He scoffed at the first couple - then I mentioned I heard good things about La Ristra. (I have noted those people and will never take food advice from them again!) Gilbert is not a close trek for either of us - but in the search for solid New Mexican food, I am more than willing to travel. He also expressed concern about being Brown in Gilbert. I assured him I'd protect him (and my car is white enough to cover both of us!), and finally sold him using the picture of the banana burrito dessert on the menu.  We shared a cheese crisp that was just like any other cheese crisp, but the chips and salsa were good. The chips were really good. I thought we were off to a great start!  I ordered the beef, Christmas style, with egg. (Christmas style is half green chile, half red.) A fried egg on top is common in New Mexico, sides of rice and black beans. My friend had the blue corn enchilada, also Christmas style, with egg; sides of rice and pinto beans.  The first sad sign was when the plates arrived. Each was served with what they call a sopapilla. Well, it's in line with most sopapillas you'd get in AZ - but it is NOTHING like the ones in New Mexico. (If you've had one, you'd understand.) Neither of us thought our food was bad, per se, but it was REALLY bland. Really, REALLY bland! My friend suggested maybe we went through a wormhole to a retirement home in Albuquerque circa 1983, it was so bland! Well over half our meals were boxed up. At least we could take refuge in the banana burrito. Well, no. They were out of it. All in all, it was such a disappointing dinner we were laughing about how we'll look back on it as a bonding experience.  I barely made it home before my dinner wanted to evacuate my body in a violent way - but I am hit and miss with dairy, so I figured it was the cheese, not the rest of the food. Until he sent me a text the next day that dinner pretty much wrecked him. The end. I see no need to go back under any circumstances.

I made it to French Grocery today for the soft opening. And there is a lot to be done before a true grand opening, but I am loving what I see so far!  We ordered 3 cafe au lait (with chickory, as it should be!) and 2 orders of beignet to go. As an impulse, we also got a bag of Zapp's potato chips.  The cafe au lait were perfect! The beignet were a bit overdone (it was mentioned the oil had gotten a bit too hot) - but totally on the right track! The flavor, texture and size was spot on - just a wee bit overdone. We are definitely happy campers!  As mentioned  - I was there right after opening on the very first day of the soft opening - so there are absolutely some kinks to work out, and more inventory to add. For today, there was a limited selection of pastry, dry goods and cold drinks, with lots of empty shelf space, cooler space and bakery case space. I am looking forward to coming back by in the coming weeks and months to watch the place fill up  - it is a great space, and the friendliness of the owners and staff is welcoming.  A GREAT addition to the area, and hopefully a great part of the community for a long time to come.  I'm definitely a fan!

As the other reviewers have stated - this is NOT the same as the 7th St or 7th Ave location.  First time in was the taco trio (al Pastor, carne asada, pollo asado) , elote (America's corn) and a large cochata (iced coffee mixed with horchata.)  The cochata was brilliant! My new favorite non alcoholic beverage. And the service was friendly. Those are the two stars. The tacos were dull and bland. The corn was just plain sad. So many GOOD elote options in this town.  So many decent elote options. So bummed this was mediocre at best.  Second visit was the same taco trio and large cochata. The pork and beef were a little better this time, the chicken was still super lame. The salsa is decent at best. At least the cochata still hit the spot.  That said...there are so many good taquerias in the area. Where tacos of a similar size and better quality cost notably less. I don't see any reason to make it back to this sad little America's franchise.

Great food, great beer, great service! I had occasion to visit twice in one week - and both times were fantastic.  I know the manager, Tracy, from the last restaurant he was at - he took great care of me there, and if it's possible, even better care of me here! Wow - I feel like a rockstar in this place! I was sharing with my lunch group Saturday - I really tend to avoid Old Town - but based on how both groups I was with last week were treated, it will be impossible for me not to frequent the place.  The servers are on the ball and don't seem to lose patience - even with large groups splitting the check multiple ways.  All food was delivered as ordered, the quality and flavor are solid and the portions generous. I am not going to make suggestions - I don't think you can go wrong anywhere on the menu.   Oh, wait. One suggestion. The Hellfire Chips  on the appetizer menu. House made chips, buffalo sauce, blue cheese. So good! Its a really large serving - so either split it as a group, or plan on that being the majority of your meal. But WOW - so simple, but delish!  Thank you, CB&CB - and thank you, Tracy - for making sure we all (in both groups) had a great experience and look forward to coming back!)

Hellllloooooo, Whole Paycheck!  I braved the crowds - I survived the parking lot (in and out) and the newest Whole Foods is open in my hood.  Sure - the store is comparable to every other WF I've been in. The bar is NOT.  Helllloooooo, 20 Highland Tavern! 36 beers on tap - 26 of them local. And tables and TVs and foods and happy hour!  Yup - I'll end up here far more than my budget wants me to.  I regret not going for the WAY discounted and amazing looking salmon and ahi. I cheer myself for jumping in on the $9.99/lb choice NY strip steaks - cut to order. They are beautiful!  Welcome to the hood, Whole Foods. We're destined to spend a whole lot of time together, and I really hope I get that raise at work. SOON.

Thanks to a conversation, with Irene V., I am no longer a threading virgin! I've waxed my brows for years, she pushed me to try threading, but lamented there was nowhere in our area to get it done. I remember seeing Preety in this shopping plaza, and told Irene I'd check it out. I walked in on a Saturday afternoon. Dipty (who I believe is the owner) was there. This is the 5th location, open about 2 months, and the only one on the east side of town. The salon is clean, but a bit barren and lacking personality. But I wasn't there for a ritzy or pampering experience, I was there to get my brows in shape! Dipty went right to work. It takes about the same amount of time as waxing, but is far more accurate, less painful, and causes less irritation. (And I hear it will take longer to grow back. Bonus!) Her service was professional and friendly, and I'll definitely be back! Glad this place opened in the neighborhood!

A lovely patio with yummy cocktails that just scream "DAY DRINK WITH ME"? Yes, please! Chips and guac and salsa appetizer to munch on while imbibing? Yes, please - and damn yummy salsa.  I enjoyed this place as Local Breeze - I had a nice brunch when it was Palette. The current incarnation, as the Vig, feels the most likely to succeed. At least I hope it does.  I've been to Vig Uptown many times, and the menu seems to be just as varied and good at this location - but more than anything...the patio is just plain fantastic!

*Happy Hour Review*  Three words: Duck Confit Poutine - rich, delicious, large portion. The name says it all - and my pictures do not do it any justice!  Three more words: Lobster Corn Dogs - small plate with only 3 pieces - but incredibly well prepared, delicious and hey - lobster for $5.00!?!  Three more words: Half price bourbon! Two incredibly well crafted and incredibly generous Manhattans later, I was feeling no pain!  One of the best parts of PHX is the under-appreciated happy hour deals at some of our best resorts. Especially this time of year - there are great values to be had, at incredible prices!  Here's the Mix Up current specials menu: Daily - happy hour 4-7; $5.00 cocktails, beer, wine and lite bites. Tuesdays - Pizza & Punch $5 flatbreads, $6 signature punch cocktail of the day: 4:00 p.m. - 12:00 a.m. Women & Whiskey Wednesdays - 1/2 price ladies bourbon night: 4:00 p.m. - 12:00 a.m. Bourbon & Burgers Thursdays - $8 burger, 1/2 price bourbons: 4:00 p.m. - 12:00 a.m.  .Can't wait to go back!

Several visits in, I like this place more and more with each experience. Daily specials for $10 - which (in most cases) includes food and a beer or wine? Yes, please! Menu with a little something for everyone? Check! Solid beer and wine selection with lots of the locals represented? You bet! The option to skip the menu, get anything you want in the store and have a place to sit and eat it while having a beer or wine? SOLD!  I've had burgers, pizza, wings and the cheeseboard. Sushi and salads, too!  Only one moment of let down so far - I was going for the wings and beer special - but didn't realize it had to be a local brew. I was so looking forward to my favorite Spring brew - Abita's Strawberry Harvest. Alas, it wasn't part of the special. In a way, that worked out far better for the store - I enjoyed a Papago Orange Blossom while there, and got a 32oz of the Abita to go. We all win! Except my wallet.  The bar staff is friendly and knowledgeable - and YAY for growlers to go!  Whole Foods doesn't have to be Whole Paycheck, if you follow the specials!  Enjoy!

3.5 stars  Restaurant Week dinner, party of two.  Happy discovery - with a Yelp check in, free appetizer of fried cuttlefish! (Similar to calamari but more tender, $12.00 value!)  The place is very clean and well appointed. Service is attentive but not annoying. As for décor - I enjoyed the novelty of Vespas instead of stools at the raw bar.   We each opted for the  1/2 dozen oysters on the half shell. While I neglected to ask the breed of oyster, they were too small to be Gulf, and too large to be N Atlantic - so the guess is Pacific NW. Very fresh and tasty. Neither of us could decide between "Petrale Sole = Heirloom Tomato + White Bean Ragout" and "Lemon Prawns & Lobster Ravioli = Pan Roasted Prawns + Lemon Caper Reduction + Lobster Ravioli + Lobster Bisque Cream Sauce" - so we ordered one of each and split them. The sole was well cooked, very delicate and the tomato and bean ragout was lovely - lots of fresh ribbons of basil; very fresh and light - complimented the fish well. The lobster ravioli was insanely good - too bad there were only 3 mid-size ravioli to split up. Super rich, great flavor and texture - incredibly well conceived dish with just the right amount of bisque. The shrimp were the letdown of the night - nothing wrong with them, just bland and plain and nothing memorable. For dessert, I was all about the neopolitan panna cotta and my friend loves tiramisu. Sadly, there was no tiramisu as listed on the Restaurant Week menu, it was a chocolate cake instead. Both desserts were tasty, but neither was amazing.  All in all, it was a very enjoyable meal, I am glad we went. Truly, no complaints. And while there are a lot of items that sound really good on the regular menu, the price point is high enough and I don't know that I was blown away enough to venture so far from home for an above-average meal. I'd go farther for an AMAZING meal, but this just didn't rank quite that high. If I am in the general vicinity and in the mood for seafood, I would not hesitate to go back, I just don't feel it is good enough to go out of my way.

There's really nothing I can add that hasn't already been shared in these reviews. Three of us went in on a Sunday evening. A couple glasses of wine, a couple of beers, a shared Schreiner's meat and cheese plate, and a (thanks, Yelp check in bonus!) peanut butter chocolate brownie that was so rich and dense and if I use more adjectives you'd think I was writing erotica!  We shared bar space with Rock-em Sock-em Robots, Gumby and Pokey and lots of laughs over asking each other Trivial Pursuit questions.  We chatted with Greg, the owner, about everything from wine to music (and his wife's revenge on his iPod) and absolutely enjoyed the experience.  It's definitely small and the vibe is more suited to NYC or SF - but I am so happy it's here! Happy hour specials are fantastic! ($5 wines and $3 beers) Greg is easy to engage in conversation and knows his product incredibly well!   I was quite impressed with how comfortable I was here - usually I feel more than a little under-dressed and under-class in a wine bar. This is a great neighborhood hangout that happens to have an amazing (and oft changing) selection of wine. Great way for me to learn more about the grapes without busting the budget or making me feel like a moron!  Welcome to the neighborhood - what a fantastic addition!

Welcome back to Indian School, Stacy!  A couple of months ago, my roommate and I moved to a new house - super close to what used to be the purple building on Indian School. And my roommate lamented how it would have been so cool to live right across the street from Stacy's BBQ - too bad it's not there anymore. Well, happy day! I noticed Saturday morning the big Grand Opening banner on the new fascia of the building. I noticed Stacy's trailer out back. And I called my roommate to share the joy! I stopped in that afternoon with my latest dining companion - to grab a pound of brisket and side of greens to go.  Newly reopened, indeed! There were no menus (not printed yet!). But the gals at the counter were super friendly,  and happy to share all that was available that day. And when Stacy peeked his head out, I was downright giddy! So happy to see him back in this spot! Happily, brisket and greens were both on the menu. The remodel improved the looks of the inside ten-fold. I am not a fan of the new outside - it looks to "clean." I love the old purple eyesore!  And the food? As good as I remember. The brisket was perfect - really didn't need any sauce at all. We got the spicy sauce - which has amazing flavor and some heat - but not really spicy enough for either of us. But it was still so damn good! The companion thought he wasn't hungry. But had NO problem hoovering half the order while I did the same. (And I am leaning toward the hypothesis that any man I can happily share my beer and BBQ with is a man worth keeping around awhile.) I got to enjoy the greens on my own - and enjoy, I did! I could practically live on Stacy's greens!  I am so happy Stacy is back on Indian School - my waistline and wallet are not! Don't forget the fried catfish! Totally worth it!

The pizza itself is three star worthy. It wasn't bad, but certainly not my favorite around. The scope of the menu and the options for those with dietary restrictions is awesome! It's a pizza place where you can opt to eat in a somewhat healthy manner! (Or be as cheesy, meaty, carby naughty as you desire!) Two of us went in on a Tuesday night, relatively late for Phoenix dinner (I think we met around 8ish). The place was packed - and we were lucky to get a table in the bar with no wait. There's a drink special each day - Tuesday was cheap premium beer. The service was friendly and on point, food was delivered quickly - fresh and hot for the pizza, fresh and cold for the salad. The visit was definitely worthy of a four star review - and I know lots of people swear by the pizza - but it just wasn't stellar for me. Good, but not amazing. However - based on the comfort and cleanliness of the place, friendliness and competency of all the staff I encountered and overall quality and volume of options - I will definitely be back!

Definitely a fan!  Enough that I created a UYE as an excuse to go back. IMHO, boils are a very social event. While it's perfectly acceptable to just go as a single, or a couple, or in the case of my last visit, three girlfriends having lunch, it's really a case of "the more, the merrier!" It's messy, table manners are non existent, and the social/party atmosphere of the boil makes the food taste even better!  This is also NOT a New Orleans style boil. Most of the seasoning is added after the animal is removed from the water. (Which is how they can offer so many flavors.) The taste is still great, but it's MUCH messier. Apparently, this is how it's done in most places outside New Orleans. Not bad, just different. And good to know before walking in.  There are non-boil things on the menu - I may venture into the fried appetizers at some point. But this place is all about the boil! Shrimp, blue crab, crab legs, lobster, crawfish, etc. All sold by the pound and you pick your seasonings.  We shared a half dozen of the grilled oysters. Not as good as ACME or Drago's in NOLA, but better than I ever expected to find in AZ.  The three of us were all in agreement to go with their spice level 3 ("I can't feel my mips.") It was not that hot. Good flavor - but it wasn't as hot as I was hoping or expecting. And we shared 1 pound of shrimp and 4 pounds of crawfish (running a special - if you buy 3, you get 1 free.) We added some corn and potatoes and loved our little mini-boil.  I was quite happy they have Abita on tap - and if they add Amber in addition to Purple Haze, I may just add that 5th star! :)  And my happy bit of not-so-insider information - they will be opening a second location (with BBQ!) this fall in Central Phoenix. So I won't have to trek to the outer reaches of the Valley to get my crawfish fix! In fact, the new place will be just over a mile from my house! Woot!  It's not cheap - but this is AZ. And the salt-water animals don't just swim up to the front door. Totally good value for the dollar - and I am glad to have them in town!

This place ROCKS! Lunch date with one of my closest friends last week - and I suggested we go here. So glad she was game!  Between the two of us, there were three full meals (I also got a to-go order to have dinner at work.)  My lunch was the turkey sandwich on focaccia with stuffing, cranberry and bib lettuce, and a small spinach salad with lemon vinaigrette. Delish! Super fresh, perfect proportions and too much food! (I added the salad to my dinner bag - the sandwich was more than enough!) I also ordered a Mexican tea cookie, not realizing they were going to add a wonderful little chocolate peanut butter no bake cookie. Both were fantastic - and I was happy to have a friend there to share with!   Dinner was the flank steak sandwich on sourdough with the baby kale salad. Excellent quality, once again perfectly proportioned. I did eat both salads that night - and they were both absolutely fantastic. I also had the lemon bar on rosewater shortbread. Good thing I got a coworker to share that with me - I think I was already well over my calorie allotment for the day. And it was amazing!  Cute place, great back patio, excellent food. Not the cheapest sandwich in town - but given the quality, the value is definitely there.  The staff was all friendly, helpful and definitely made us feel welcome and valued.  Look forward to my next visit!

The Henry One of my favorite dining buddies and I went for the last night of restaurant week - neither of us had been to the Henry before - and the menu looked fantastic. We have made a habit of dining together at least once each restaurant week - and find a place heavy on veggies or water protein (she doesn't eat anything that walks or flies), so we can share all courses and get a better range of the menu. The Henry had at least two veggie/fish options for each course - so it would work well for us. For drinks, I ordered the Final Word (my current favorite drink, which I make at home quite often), she had the Old Fashioned.  Hers was perfect. Mine was a bit heavy on the chartreuse, so I sent it back for a touch more luxardo to balance it out - then it, too, was perfect! For the appetizers, we split the salad (spinach, roasted beet, fennel, stone fruits, puffed grains, goat cheese, and pistachio) and the smoked salmon (potato hash brown, crème fraiche, and arugula). Both were good portions, both fresh and very tasty. The salmon was saltier than it should have been - almost like the chef forgot smoked salmon is already salty, and added a pinch too much as final seasoning. But the flavor was dead on, and the overall construction of the bite was fantastic! Our entrees were the sweet pea tortelli and the salmon, served with quinoa, beets and arugula. The pasta was light and well made, the flavor rich and delicate, and the sauce was creamy without being heavy - the best part was the fresh sweet pea flavor in every bite. I'm not even a fan of peas, and I could have eaten a vat of this! The salmon was a bit of a letdown. There was nothing wrong with it, but it was just really average. The quinoa was stellar (if I could only get my version at home to be so good!), and I love beets in just about any dish - these were incredibly fresh and perfectly roasted. Dessert was bread pudding and the lemon meringue tart. Both were well executed and worth enjoying every last bite of. I can't pick a favorite between the two - they complemented each other perfectly, along with a cup of fresh coffee. I don't think either would have been quite as good without the counterpart. I liked the setup. It feels classic and comfortable; the patio will be fantastic in just a few weeks when the evenings are nice again. The tables and booths are large and spacious - and at a decent distance from each other so you don't feel you have to speak over the neighboring conversations. The regular menu prices are a bit higher than they need to be (keeping format with the other Fox restaurants), but not so high I would decline an invite back. It may not make it to my regular rotation, but I will happily go back for more meals.

I don't want to write this review, because I always want to be able to get a good spot on the patio for happy hour. The fewer people that know about this place, the better my odds! My first visit here was for a wedding on the patio. There was something so beautiful and magical about the bride and groom arriving to the ceremony by boat, and watching the sunset over the water certainly added to the experience. The food was buffet style Mexican - and quite tasty. I went back for a happy hour with my sister. The margaritas and sangrias were a great compliment to a warm spring day. The weather on the patio was perfect - and having a cocktail while watching another sunset on the water was just as peaceful, beautiful and enchanting as it had been for the wedding. We didn't have much by way of food. A couple of orders of wings, fries, and guacamole. I think they were all good. Honestly, they may have been mediocre, but with fantastic company and this setting, they would have tasted great no matter what. The staff is friendly and laid back, and I am thrilled to have a waterfront happy hour just minutes from my office. Perfect mini-vacation. This will definitely be on my regular rotation!

Two visits so far-  and MANY more to come!  First was with a good friend. We each had a cocktail, she had the brisket sandwich with side of cheesy jalapeno grits, I had the farm to table veggie plate.  OMG! The sandwich was solid, the grits were amazing! (She complained they were too cheesy. On my planet, there's no such thing!) The veggie platter was one of the most perfect plates I've ever had! Tri colored cauliflower, heirloom tomatoes, garlicky Swiss chard and grilled asparagus. Beautiful, delicious, and a huge portion!   The following week, I brought out of town family. There were 6 of us - and we were all over the menu. Everyone was quite happy with their orders - and my cousin who is a bit of a foodie/veggie snob pulled me aside to say it was the best meal she had while in AZ!  Across the board - the cocktails, the entrees, and the dessert were top notch. Service has been flawless both times - and I am so glad I live close to this place!

This weekend, there's a sale here. TONS of $1 records and everything else is half price.  The good: Did I walk out with 18 records for under $60? YES! Is there a solid selection of all genres spanning the decades? YES! Are most of the records well organized, alphabetized by genre? YES!  The less than stellar: Are the $1 records in boxes and crates with no organization at all. Sigh, yes. Does the inside of this place REEK of incense? Sadly, yes.  The fantastic: The owner knows his stuff and is easy to engage in conversation. Will I be back? YES YES YES!

Saturday night. 6:30 p.m., party of 5. Out of chicken satay! Out of shrimp! The rest of the food was hit or miss. I ordered tom kha gai (coconut milk soup with chicken, mushrooms, green onion, and galang) and it was one of the best I've ever had. Depth of flavor, a hint of heat, and incredibly fresh. I also had the pad woonsen (chicken and veggies with thin soybean noodles in a light soy sauce). It was completely tasteless. The other diners at my table seemed to have the same inconsistencies. Some items were great - others barely edible. Service was equally inconsistent. Plates were, for the most part, brought out one at a time. At times, as long as 10 minutes went between the arrival of dishes. The company was fantastic - we stayed until close and had great conversation. After about 7, we were the only customers there at all. A few tweaks in the pacing of the kitchen, maybe some music in the dining room, and consistency in the food could make this a great little neighborhood spot. I hope they can last long enough to make those tweaks and get customers in the door!

I can't shut up about this place!  I had seen Copper City Bourbon around, but had not yet tried it.  Rodney was at the Yelp Downtown Revival party - I was bummed the bourbon was all gone by the time I got to him, and all he had going was the gin. Not a gin fan at all, he sensed my disappointment and pulled a smaller bottle of whiskey out for me to try.  It.Was.Amazing!!! And - not available in stores - to get it, I'd have to go to the distillery in Tempe.  I did that (with Robyn N.) on Saturday after a huge and wonderful lunch - and am so happy I did!  The place is a bit confusing to get to - I'd suggest calling first and asking directions. We really weren't sure we were in the right place.  We met up with Jason, Rodney's partner and the master distiller.  The bourbon is good. Really good. But that whiskey - WOW! And - get this! Not only is it distilled here, but the wheat is grown near Casa Grande! Totally AZ business!   I've been telling everyone at work, all my friends (in person, on phone and Facebook) about this stuff. I've invited people over to my place to taste it. It really is THAT GOOD!  Super nice guys, with a great product! (Oh, and I hear the gin is good, too!) Jason tells us they are hoping to expand and take over the little complex they're in. When this happens, not only do I hope they'll open it for parties, I'd LOVE to see a Yelp event here!

That was awesome!  Show up, see some friends, have samples from Short Leash, order dinner from Short Leash, get a nice cold cider, see a movie. And what a fun surprise - Wayne's World! So many scenes brought back great memories - and a couple of great moments I'd completely forgotten about.  I love the concept - show up and see a surprise movie - all we know is it was at least partially filmed in AZ.  Lots of good guesses - lots of audience participation - LOTS of fun!  Thank you FilmBar and Short Leash and Lindsey! A great evening out - and I can't wait to do it again!  I'd never been to FilmBar before - and definitely look forward to heading back - what a great venue!  Always nice to see a movie I wouldn't get to see anywhere else - and a decent selection of wine and solid selection of beer to enjoy while watching the movie? SCORE! Several upcoming movies I'm looking forward to checking out here.

40's and 50's retro and vintage clothes, accessories, and stuffs (knick knacks, décor, etc.)  I am not used to paying much for clothes...and if you see the way I dress and how little I care about fashion, that's quite obvious. Then I walked into The Green Gurl. I went in looking for a dress to wear to a party. I found a great one - but was nervous about the price tag. I asked them to hold it for me, and I would think on it while running other errands. I decided to go for it - and found another, even better dress on my way back in the store. A fantastic dress. An amazing dress! A dress that accentuates all the good stuff and minimizes all the not good stuff and I feel gorgeous in it! (I never knew a single garment could wield so much power!) Turns out, I have a body that just begs for pin-up greatness! Who knew? Well, the staff at The Green Gurl. Who were friendly, and patient, and know their stuff! And it seems ALL women have bodies that beg for pin up greatness! These clothes flatter every body type - short, tall, thin, curvy, and everything between!  I won't be able to afford to get much here on a regular basis - but even adding one or two new amazing items to my wardrobe each year would be a big step forward in my fashion world. I'm in!

Beer! (Lots of them!) Wine! (Great selection!) Games! (For your imbibing entertainment!) Grilled cheese sandwiches! (GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICHES!)  Overall, I prefer the ambiance of Whining Pig more (It feels like a real city bar), but prefer the Pig's Meow because I've never had to wait to get two seats together.  This is a great place - the staff is knowledgeable and friendly, and it's a great environment to escape the real world for just a little bit.  Did I mention grilled cheese sandwiches?

Tonight was the soft opening, and I was super lucky to snag an invite. I brought my stepfather as my +1, and have a feeling that got me more brownie points than I ever could have hoped for! I've been to the Mesa location several times, but was looking forward to the BBQ. Stepdad was having a new experience from the start. We shared an order of hush puppies, a bag of shrimp (with corn, potato, and sausage) and 1/4 lb samples of the brisket and pulled pork with sides of traditional BBQ and Creole mustard sauces. We also were served Hurricanes to drink. (Or could have opted for a couple of Grand Canyon brews.) It was all terrific! Since Stepdad had never experienced Angry Crab, I got to see it through his eyes as a new place. He was floored! The hushpuppies are more dense than any I've seen before, but the flavor is just incredible. The shrimp was delicious (maybe boiled about 30 seconds too long - but this was a soft opening - I was expecting hiccups.) The brisket and pulled pork were both tender, moist and incredibly flavorful even without the sauce. We both enjoyed both sauces. The traditional was solid, and the Creole mustard was a tangy change of pace.  Yes - we got messy and went through a stack of napkins - but there are handwash stations in the dining room - and mess is half the fun of a crab shack. I'm really looking forward to the official opening, and already have a UYE planned for next Saturday - I can't wait to see the full menu! I'm not alone - Stepdad is coming to join me there for Sunday Night Football next week - and is already planning what he'll be ordering! It's more than a little dangerous this place is so close to home. I had joked with the owner over the summer that I will have my mail forwarded there and my paycheck direct deposited into his account. Now I'm not so sure it was a joke, after all...

No. Just. Plain. No. I had a class downtown that started early, so the lunch break was earlier than most places opened. The sign on the door at Tom Yum claims they open at 10. To me, that means prep work has been done, and the kitchen is ready to take orders by 10. Maybe 10:10, on a bad day. I walked in at 10:20. The young lady behind the counter seemed put off to have me there, and said they weren't able to do everything on the menu, as they just opened. My order was simple. An order of chicken satay, and a bowl of tom ka gai. She took the order, took my money (which I stupidly left a decent tip on), THEN told me it would be 45 minutes to an hour for my to-go order to be ready. I was incredulous. This is downtown Phoenix. Most of the people who would be here for lunch get a total of 30 minutes, *maybe* an hour for lunch...no one can wait 45 minutes to an hour before getting the food! I asked her to refund my card - I would find somewhere else to eat. She didn't know how to do that. I asked her to call over the manager. There was none. Just her, and two men in the kitchen who also claimed to not know what to do. I asked her to call the owner. She went to the kitchen, and when she came back, told me my food would be ready within 10 minutes. WHAT? Somehow, my demanding my card be refunded enabled my food to cook in a fraction of the time? I should remember this magical trick everyplace I go that expects me to wait longer than I deem reasonable! Anyway - I get my food and take it back to the classroom to eat. The chicken satay was painfully dry and bland. No amount of peanut sauce, hot sauce and cucumber could fix it. After two bites, I threw away the remainder. The soup was okay. If someone else bought it and brought it to me, I would be more than willing to eat the soup again. Short of that happening - the next time I will be in this spot is when it's the new restaurant in this space, after Tom Yum is out of business.

I haven't used the delivery service - YET, but have been in the store. I live outside the advertised delivery area - so I wanted to go talk to the owners and see if they'd be willing to deliver to me, if I place a large enough order. (They will!) They have an incredible variety of wine in stock, and really know their stuff! They're happy to discuss pairings and make suggestions - and if they don't carry a specific label, they can suggest similar or better varietals at the same price point. Solid selection of beer, too. What really makes Arcadia Premium shine (aside form the delivery service, of course), is the focus on local and small batch product - and building relationships. Local dairies providing some of the cheese - part of an impressive cheese and charcuterie selection. (And Lara knows her cheese!) The "miscellaneous" tab on the website is almost cooler than the beer and wine selection! I lucked out on my Saturday morning visit - fresh loaves of bread by Mandy. Amazing bread! While in the store, I was chatting with Mandy and the owners, Lara and Joel, and was treated like a friend. Which is how they treated everyone who came in. Great business - I am looking forward to going back to check out all the offerings - and looking forward to taking advantage of the delivery service, too!

Decent sushi at fantastic prices! I've been driving to Desert Ridge's Sushi Station location for a few years - and am thrilled to have one so close to home now! They aren't reinventing the sushi wheel, by any means - but it's fresh, close, affordable and convenient. The restaurant is set up with a conveyor belt, and small plates starting at $1.75. With the affordable prices and small portions, it's easy to enjoy a range of rolls, nigiri and salads without breaking the bank. There's also a full menu, in case what you're craving doesn't appear on the conveyor - they will make it for you. I've found the service to be hit or miss - but that's just for drinks, refills, and the initial delivery of wasabi and mixing bowls. The food is constantly circulating - so the service there is unbeatable...you grab what you want when it comes by. So far, I've been averaging a meal each week since they opened this location - and at these prices, I can keep up that pace without destroying my food budget!

I don't want to write this review. I want this place to remain a little known treasure. How do I help make it popular enough to stay open, but obscure enough to be able to get what I want with virtually no one else in the store, so I can peruse at my leisure and not bump into others? I drove by several times over the last few months without stopping, with the signage on Thomas I couldn't tell if the place was going to be amazing - much like some of my favorite ethnic food dives - horrific on the outside, but with amazing food; or awful - like a bunch of meth heads bought the $2 records at Goodwill and are now selling them for $5 to feed the habit. Happily, the former is true! The place is relatively small, but very well laid out. Good mix of new and used records - and a very accommodating owner (Mike) who is willing to order in records on request (as he did for me!), and a decent selection of rock and punk albums. There are few record players available of varying quality and price point. Lots of 45's for $1.00, and some CDs for good measure. Sadly, the days of getting screaming good deals on vinyl are over - it's cool again, so now, it's not just a few of us buying. The upside of that, lots of reissues so I've been able to get some treasured old stuff on brand new vinyl (Iggy and the Stooges!). None of it is cheap anymore - but few things worth collecting are. Mike mentioned he gives the best deals on trades in town - so it's time to go through my collection, determine what I don't want anymore - and trade it in for stuff I do!  So happy to have found this gem of a place - and so sad for my budget!

Remember the old commercials for Mervyn's? The ones with the desperate shopper lady at the window chanting "Open! Open! Open!" That's how I'd been feeling about the Coffee Studio. For MONTHS, there was the teaser that I would have a local coffee place within walking distance of my house. And finally, finally, that day came - THE COFFEE STUDIO IS OPEN!! I'm relatively basic when it comes to coffee. I don't mean the "venti pumpkin spice latte half calf skinny with extra pumps of some sickingly sweet flavor and whip for $7.00" kind of basic - I mean I actually like the taste of good coffee. Add a little half and half, and I am a happy woman. Or a well-balanced cappuccino from time to time.  So - I ordered the medium roast plain drip coffee. And it was good. Very good. Good enough, that I skipped the cream entirely. It was smooth, a little chocolately, and so, so good! I haven't tried the breakfast sandwich, which I was told is excellent. I haven't tried the cold brew or any of the espresso options. But based on the quality of just the plain old drip coffee, this place is a winner.  So glad they're finally open - and so glad they're close to home! This will be a regular stop for me, given my coffee addiction and preference to avoid the big monopolistic venti-chain whenever I can!

Someone else used the words "salt bomb" in their review - that sums it up perfectly!  I was in on a Saturday afternoon for a late lunch. I wanted to get a feel for the offerings, so I decided to order the two meat and two sides platter. I requested pork and brisket (they were out of pork, so I switched to chicken) as the meats, and the potato salad and beans for the sides. The employees behind the counter were great. Friendly, able to answer questions, and in good moods. The place is kept clean, and given the "off" time I visited, plenty of table space to choose from. The meats are served without sauce - and there are four sauces on the table to choose from. (Mild, sweet, mustard based, and hot.) The potato salad was nice. Maybe a little heavy on the red onion - but I happen to like onion, so I didn't mind. The beans were bland, and somehow, the pork in the beans was completely dry and tough. I can't figure out how that's possible - as there's so much liquid in the beans - any meat in there should positively be tender. Then comes the salt bomb! The chicken was so salty, I could barely taste any of the sauces other than the hot, which tasted like a BBQ salt lick. Tasting it without the sauce, I could barely discern any chicken OR smoke, only salt. The brisket (also seen in another review) was almost like a beef jerky. It was so dry and tough - and when tasting without the sauce - I could taste the meat and smoke - but mostly - no surprise here - salt! In the time it took me to eat the potato salad, half the beans and half the meat, I went through three cups of iced tea, and filled my cup a fourth time on my way out - and was still thirsty). I ended up throwing away over half the meat and leaving still hungry - I just can't handle all that salt. There are several options for decent BBQ in the area - I won't be coming back here at all.

I've been able to sample a good cross section of the menu - but it's the ahi burger that keeps me coming back.  Sushi-Grade Tuna, Sprouts, Teriyaki, Honey Wasabi, Nori Chips, Pickled Ginger - this is one of the most incredible sandwiches I've ever had. It's downright ahigasmic! ;) The fries are delicious, strong selection of beers and decent cocktails. It's not cheap - but definitely a good add to the upgraded fast casual market.
