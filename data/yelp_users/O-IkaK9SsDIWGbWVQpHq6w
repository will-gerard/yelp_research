I love Crazy Jims, I was downtown and hungry so my old stand by was open. I got my usual the Gyro/Feta salad to go. When it rang up for $10.75 i was in shock...Its out of price for the little Gyro meat you get on top of iceberg lettuce....I hope this will change...

Went here before the Foo Fighters last night, the place was crowed and not staffed at all, I was waiting at the bar for 20mins and the bartender never came to our side. This place can't handle big events downtown, Stay Away....

Worst McDonald's ever. It's not the fact that they can never seem to get my order right, but trying to get it corrected is more hassle than its worth. Food is usually cold anyway. But it's  their management that's the worst. They treat you like the idiot, when it's their fault to begin with. If you call the posted customer service number, don't bother it's a recording and still have not received a callback. Avoid at all costs.

Staff was great, food not so much, everything tasted off. The worst gyro meat I had in my life.
