Although I am not always in the mood for Rubio's fish tacos when my wife wants them, I always realize she was right on the first bite.

A little pricey but great food.   Bonus point for the white guy playing the sitar in an otherwise totally Indian staff.

The service, the slowness, the wet bread, and they had me drive off without my drinks. I'm guessing they don't care about yelp reviews because all issues from first visit persisted and it can't be chalked up to newness anymore. Why does the management allow this mediocrity? Like another reviewer, my French dip should have probably just been called Bread.

Just HOW do you run a fast food place this poorly?? I have been here 26 minutes and I'm still 3 cars away from the window. Did they just absolutely forget to train their employees? Ps it's 3:45, not in any way a rush. It took 10 minutes to get to the speaker, sat at the speaker another 8 minutes before someone came on in the quietest voice possible. I asked if a combo came with a small drink and fries how much would it be to upgrade to medium. A question they must get litterally 200 times a day. Answer: "hold on"  FOUR minutes later she comes back and says "a medium drink is $2.09" which is technically correct but in no way an answer to the question I asked. I just gave up and took the small combo.   This review took me a further five minutes to write and I haven't moved an inch. Even if this is the best burger I ever ate (who are we kidding) I will never ever ever be back.  I get the message, Rally's, loud and clear. F you, too!

We couldn't wait to try this restaurant. Unfortunately it did not live up to expectations. We started with cornbread muffins. My cornbread muffins are much better. And I'm not a professional chef. Then we had the po' boys and gumbo on the side.  The bread was delicious; the sandwiches overall were just alright. The catfish po'boy had the fish put in last so it was only in one bite in three.  That gumbo was not what I was expecting it all, it looked and tasted like pork stew. No seafood, barely any andouille. My father and I were eating and having the exact same thought: "I miss Baby Kay's." Unfortunately this place is quite a bit more expensive than Baby Kay's was. I don't think I'll be back. Which sucks, because it's right down the street from my house.
