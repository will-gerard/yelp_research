Yeah, the rocking chairs are a cute touch, but how comfortable do you think they are when you've just flown a red-eye (that was 45 minutes early...thanks a LOT) and have a connecting flight 3 hours later, with the temperature of the place hovering around 45F.   They are not conducive to sleep, happiness or non-terrorist thoughts.  I chose to sleep on the floor...the just shampooed, wet, cold, stinky floor.  I just wanted some sleep, DAMNIT.

They have a small, but respectable beer menu.  Friendly gent at the bar, and a very cozy atmosphere.  But..let's be honest.  No one is coming here for the beer menu, decor, or friendly staff.  You're boozin' up waiting for the damned delicious pizza next door.

As good as any! I felt compelled to review since everyone else seems to hate on this place. Sure, it has long lines at 12:30 (it'd be weird if it didn't!). But service was crazy fast and friendly.   And they didn't skimp on my request for lots of mild sauce.

I drove up and I parked in the insanely full parking lot.  I walk in to Pane Bianco and I am the only one there?  Apparently LUX is the most popular place in all of Phoenix, and the owners of these two businesses are affiliated with one another...  So...let's just say the service when you are the only diners there was impeccable.  Oh, I ordered my sandwich. I said a sentence. And then my sandwich (plus a small slaw/salad that came with, gratis) arrived.  INSANELY fast.  I guzzle water like I'm dying of thirst, and I never even had to look for our server to refill the glass.  She was there to help out but not obtrusively so.  Dined in and took my excess half of the tomato, basil and (housemade!) mozzerella sandwich home for dinner! Not bad to get two full meals for a $10 sandwich!

I always feel silly reviewing a huge chain, but my service here last week was so friendly and great I had to get my Yelp on!  They offer several manager's specials and of course half-priced drinks and other various specials depending on time of day.  I was picking up some grub for a buddy who had been helping me with man stuff at my house all day, and got him a humungous M&M Sonic Blast.  They also put up with my special request to add caramel sauce to said Blast.  ('Cause it wasn't unhealthy enough yet...?).  They also gave me ample ketchup for the two orders of tots I got.  There's nothing worse than getting home to realize there's just not enough.  There was a small young-ish family sitting outside and the awesome carhop, Elizabeth, brought out a handful of balloons for the kiddos.  Who can resist a balloon?!?  Warning: you cannot leave a tip on a credit card payment.  I HATE that...especially when there is no warning. I'm left feeling like a d-bag cheapskate, but luckily Elizabeth took it in stride as she didn't have enough change to break the only paper money I had on me.

Ah, the dreaded worst-experience of my life, horrible service, overcharged BIRTHDAY meal...that ended up in moderate-severe food poisoning.  I'm talking the kind of food poisoning where at one point I desecrated the restrooms of a lovely restaurant in downtown Phoenix and ended up laying face down on the sidewalk...to where a homeless man asked me if I was ok.  Yeah.  It was that bad.  Food poisoning aside, it was STILL the worst meal of my life, and this WAS my favorite low-key restaurant in the valley.  Apparently my birthday fell on the last day of a groupon or livingsocial redemption.  Unlucky us, we paid full price (more than actually...since we were charged for the wrong items they brought out and subsequently took back), and were treated worse somehow than the coupon folks -- because it was a set menu and so the kitchen didn't want to make things not on THAT menu -- despite our paying full freaking price.  FACT: When one is celebrating their birthday, they want a cocktail.  I wanted a cocktail.  Actually, I wanted three.  I got my first cocktail after I'd been there nearly an hour (oh yeah, the "10 minute" wait I was told about was actually 40).  I didn't get a refill.  Or asked if I wanted a refill. Of that drink, or my water.  But I asked!  Oh, did I ask!   I drank my water and my dining companions.  And then eventually drank the melted ice from my un-refilled mojito. The 2 employees (great staffing job on a day you know will be busy with coupon redeemers!) were basically losing their minds, running around, and super stressed.  They had basically given up by the time we were eating.   That is why I feel like the food poisoning occurred from something truly awful. Like employees deliberately fucking with my food horrible.  I'm not sure what they normally do when people have their birthday at a restaurant, but we weren't offered dessert menus, let alone a comped dessert.  They knew it was my birthday.  They knew at the beginning we were paying the full price.  And still...worst.service.ever.  ***I actually filled out a comment card back in November listing my email address and phone number, where I specifically requested to be contacted (again, this was before the food poisoning).  This review was written right after the visit, and I sort of "sat" on it for literally over 6 months, in hopes someone would actually contact me.  I gave them the chance, I guess they really just don't give a shit.

It doesn't even seem right that I have never reviewed this place, as I've been coming to and raving about "The Parilla" for going on 7 years now.  It is my de facto "friends in town and want some good Mexican" stop.  In fact, I'm freakin' shocked by the low ratings this place is getting!!  As with anyone Mexican place, they start you out with chips and awesome salsa.  There's a spicy smooth red sauce, a pico-type salsa, and the piece de resistance....the avocado tomatillo salsa.  They do, however, charge for extra chips/salsa after the first freebie refill.  I recommend anyone try the Tortilla Soup (note: NOT a chicken tortilla soup).  You can get with or without toppings of sour cream and avocado for an additional cost, but I find it perfect as is.  It's mostly broth with cheese and tortilla strips (of course), but it is just such a delish soup. For my entree, I always get #25, which is a vegetarian combo of a tamale and cheese enchilada, which I have them use mole sauce instead of traditional enchilada sauce.  It comes with refried beans (the pinto beans are cooked with pork) and rice.  The soup and this plate are MORE than enough for dinner and breakfast/lunch the next day.  They have several other locations in the Valley, a few in Tucson, one in Guadalajara, and one in Mexico City.

I'm normally one to shy away from restaurants that appear (inside and out) as if they're going to give me the worst case of E. Coli/Salmonella/Asbestos/Gun-shot wounds I've ever had.  But I just don't care when it comes to Carolinas!  Having worked at Sky Harbor for few years I ate here too often to count and never had a bad experience.  Just don't look too closely at your surroundings when you're picking up your grub!

Legit, delicious food.   A few pals and I came here after volunteering at a school nearby. When we drove past in the morning, we knew we'd have to forgo the volunteers' lunch and save room for this.   I went for cheese enchiladas while my dining companions got various tacos. Their enchilada sauce was super flavorful as was the hot sauce (which I always drench my food with). Didn't love the refried beans but otherwise my meal was on point.   Bonus for the meat being grilled outside, so you can follow the scent into the restaurant, knowing you're in for a treat.   Also, the place is nice and bright and clean.

It's pretty ballsy to think you can get away with only serving your own beer. ...especially considering they're not all that great.

Having seen all sort of specialists, rheumatologists and other practioners over the years, I was overjoyed to see Dr. Calderon, who gave me a thorough examination. He almost immediately gave me a fairly obscure diagnosis that is 100% spot-on. How I spent 20 years chasing the answer and he nailed it in minutes is beyond my comprehension, but I am incredibly grateful.   You will be seen by a PA on your first visit, and subsequent visits mostly by a PA as well.   Only complaint is the office is not set up for those of us with joint problems. The pens are total junk and made it nearly impossible for me to fill out my paperwork, (must press incredibly hard and were super thin so hard to grip) and waiting to check out there is nothing to hold on to for those of us who have difficulty standing and walking.   Despite that, I will consider myself a loyal patient to Dr. Calderon.

Setting: dust.  Disarray.  Tall blond woman going out of her way to be unhelpful.  Mood: grumpy as you will be wiping off dirty, dusty glasses on your once-black, now-dusty brown clothing.  Toni is the reason this isn't a 1-star review.  After we sought help NOT from the blond woman, we found Toni. She was very cordial, helpful and apologetic for the absolute mess they are in with their renovation.  Unfortunately, due to her or the person who actually made my lenses, the lenses were totally ruined and anyone looking through them sees up to 3 reflections per light that are viewable.  A complete waste of 3 hours of my life selecting frames, waiting for them to be created, and then returning them (and even more fun, waiting for/hoping my insurance is credited back so I can get some glasses elsewhere that actually allow me to see).

Used to love this place when I lived here, and had the opportunity to come back on a work trip.  Was packed (even VERY late at night), being Superbowl weekend, but they made space for me at the bar anyways.  I got the Thai Steak salad (I think?) and a bunch of beer.  Great service, probably even more so due to my seating.  I was near the entrance though so every time the door opened I was attacked with a burst of cold air.  Best part is I somehow expensed the beer with my company (and didn't get questioned) :)

Plenty of parking, clean, well-kept, and very populated.  There is also a regular police presence here which makes me think the signs telling visitors to hide their valuables are because petty theft and/or car break-ins are prevalent here (I have experienced neither, thankfully...).  The walking paths are always clean and have lots of couples and families taking advantage of them.  The only thing I don't like is that they don't overseed for both winter and summer grass, so it can get pretty messy to play in the pseudo-grass with kids or dogs!

Service was a joke. It truly, absolutely took 11 minutes to get a waitress to acknowledge my presence.   No happy hour menu.   "Communal bar table" is a great idea but situated that you get bumped in to by staff with no apology. Or at least I didn't.  Food is good but no thanks. Won't return.

Similar to Trader Joe's or Whole Foods, but a lot more "gourmet" and even more helpful sales staff.  Wine selection is amazing with a staffed sommelier.  I used to live across the street from the Thompson Peak location, and loved the weeknight specials like stir-fry prepared in front of you.  It reminds me of similar dorm cafeteria specials...only good, and a helluva lot more expensive!

I  always take first-time Phoenix visitors here and they instantly think I am (and all of Phoenix)  waaay cooler than I actually am.  Has a great vibe, always jamming the jazz music and has friendly waiters.  And don't forget the Pizzookie! (sp?)  If you are planning on ordering deep-dish and aren't wanting to make a day of it, you may want to peruse the menu online and call your order in, or at least  right you get there (even at typically slow times, there's always a bit of a wait for a table).

I came here with a Groupon.  I'd guess it's the only way they can get customers to come to this place.  Unfortunately the salad and miso soup were the highlight of the meal (see pic).  The chicken katsu was horrible...super greasy and over a bed of plain, gummy white rice.  Took two bites and had them take the rest away.  My Philadelphia roll was HOT.  Yes. I've never had hot sushi before, but there is a reason, and it is because it is absolutely disgusting.  And it was cooked salmon.  Ate one piece and had them take the rest away.  I ordered a mixed drink which has 3 ingredients.  My server promised they knew how to make it, and when I received it, it was clearly made with a mixture of alcohols, even though only one type is used in the drink.  When I tried to pay with the groupon, I was told I didn't spend enough (total $28 of $30 spent).  The server demanded I buy something else or else I couldn't use the groupon, despite my explaining that I absolutely did NOT expect to receive any money back.  Bought another shitty roll and left that there.  Never again.

Food: Compared to most pub grub, this place is fantastic! Most items are easily vegetarian-ized without any attitude.  Since I've been a regular in 2004, the menu has changed very little if at all (I haven't noticed anything chagned, but then again I'm not exactly perusing the hamburger/beef section of the menu).  Though the menu is pretty static, they do have some fantastic daily specials for lunch and dinner that aren't always prominent, so you might have to ask specifically to see that menu.  Beer: Obviously this is why you came here -- cue personal mental battle between Peach Ale and Hefewiezen (usually Peach wins).  For those who drink "real" beer, the 8th Street Ale or KiltLifter may be more to your liking.  Setting: Loud. TVs galore.  It's a bar after all... They have a great (smaller) patio and part of the dining room opens to the patio.  Staff: Your typical hot girl set.  No haughtiness or lack of service whether I'm part of a large group or flying solo at the bar with other regulars.    Parking: The section of parking lot right in front is ALWAYS full, so really, don't even bother trying.  The larger lot adjacent always has plenty of spots.  Common sense warning: This place is popular and the cops know it.  I've been stalked in the parking lot and one time even followed for a few miles before being pulled over for "driving at or below the speed limit".  I didn't get a DUI because I only had a few beers and waiting awhile before leaving, but be careful and be SMART! :)

Being an avid carb lover, it's safe to say that if it has "bread" in the name, chances are I LOVE it!  Their tomato bread salad should win an award.  Granted, I had never heard of such a thing before, so I have nothing to compare it to, but damn!   It is AMAZING!

Nothing but good things to say about these folks!  Dr. Sherman is very knowledgable and experienced (at least with my procedures) and he manages to be kind and funny as well! You know that whole bedside manner that many docs nowadays are missing?  He's got it!  The rest of the support staff are great as well.  Billing IMO takes awhile but that's perhaps due more to insurance taking their sweet time with approving/denying things.  On a fairly costly procedure, SS&S was significantly (and I mean SIGNIFICANTLY) cheaper than what my neurologist charged, and their procedure price quotes have always been right on the money (ha) for me.  Also, that probably won't be relevant to most, but when I had a minor medical crisis at their facility, everyone was quick to run in, get me meds and get me breathing. So..yeah...sorry I traumatized everyone, but thanks again for that! :)  Also of note, these docs don't accept solicitors and take minimal pharma incentives (this is reportable and public record), so you can trust that these Top Docs are the real thing and truly have your interests at heart.

Totally solid and extremely affordable* for basic manicures and pedicures. I usually call when I'm thinking of coming in to make an appointment, as they tend to get super busy on weekends (and doesn't help that I've seen maximum 3 people working here ever).   Unlike some salons, if I ask for a design that will cost extra, they tell you the cost to make sure you're ok with it, rather than just going ahead and surprising you upon checkout.   They don't have the best selection of polishes (at least for Essie) but they are happy to suggest other polishes when I make a poor selection in the case of transparent glitters, for example. They also have a great magazine selection and usually have the news on TV, and are happy to change the channel upon request.   *so much so that I wish I could in good conscience give them a lower star review so as to keep this place available when I need them.

For live tunage, I tend to go to the smaller, more intimate venues of the valley...you know, Crescent, Sail Inn, Martini Ranch, and even sometimes the dreaded Marquee.  A few nights ago was my first visit to the Mesa Arts Center, to see Rodrigo y Gabriela.  Holy crap, was I impressed!    -The architecture is totally gorgeous inside and out -The venue itself had great acoustics -Parking was cheap ($5 garage) -Legit concessions offerings for decent prices (canned local beer for $6 - not bad...I'm actually surprised they serve beer considering it's Mesa! -Friendly staff and ushers (who looked to be in the 60-80 year old range)  Guess who's signing up for concert updates for MAC?!

My silly golf cart wouldn't charge up, and I was advised by someone who will remain unnamed (protect the guilty and all) that my charger had gone kaput.  He said the guys at Pohle would hook me up with fantastic rebuilding of the charger.  I called mid-morning to see if they could do the work while I was there, or if the likely problem was a big job.  He said if I was there by 3, they'd be able to fix it while I waited.  Well...more silly things happened at work, and I dind't get there til 3:45.  They still offered to try and fix it that day, rather than make me drive all that way again (they have this location in East Mesa, and two in Sun City...clearly golf cart maintenance is an old fogey sort of business).  A lovely gentlemen grabbed the charger from my car (so heavy!) and they hooked it up right away.  Much to my dismay, the damn thing worked, meaning the actual problem lies within my golf cart.  We talked through some optioins of what is probably wrong with the cart, gave me some pricing, and sent me on my merry way..but not until the same guy carried it back to my car for me!  No charge.  No pressure to use them for further service.  Just friendly, honest folks. Kudos!

It's kind of nuts how much take-out business this place gets, and you'd never notice it just by driving by!  It's a simple Greek menu, with plenty of options for vegetarians like myself.  I usually get a pita sandwich with a side salad instead of fries, but last night I splurged and got the Vegetarian Platter.  For $10, you get basically 2 meals worth of food - good for sharing or in my usual case, being a total fatass and eating it (nearly) all.  The pita included with the Veg platter is notably thinner than traditional pita bread, but I actually prefer it (honestly, it almost seems like grilled tortillas but I know that's not right).  This way, you can save on the carbs as you scoop up some delicious baba and hummus.  The falafel here is much crispier than I've had anywhere else...and I love it!  Service is friendly and quick. Packaging for to-go orders has always been adequate...no spills on the drive home for me!  Bonus: parking is plentiful in the adjacent lot, and you can sit on the cozy patio while you wait for your order to be prepared!

I tried not to giggle when I said his name (pronounced Dick-E).    I tried not to giggle at my first appointment when he hobbled in on a broken leg.  I tried not to hug him out of gratitude when he took me seriously and provided excellent care (something missing from visits with a Scottsdale Healthcare North Dr...)  I tried to give him 5-stars...but I switched jobs and they don't take my current insurance.

I've only stayed here once but have hung out here several times.   I didn't think the rooms were necessarily anything special, particularly because the design is sooo not my style.  The ultimate hangout spot  is the large patio/balcony overlooking the pool(s)/grounds/rest of the Valley.  I'd always bring newcomers/PHX visitors here to have a few (extremely expensive) cocktails just for the atmosphere, and everyone LOVES  it.    The pools are easy to sneak into, though I wasn't TECHNICALLY sneaking in, just waiting for some friends who were staying there and I let myself in prior to their arrival.  Unlike some other high-end hotels, parking is FREE, including garage parking, so that was nice, and not expected  Edit: The zipcode for the Phoenician is a Scottsdale zipcode, from my work standpoint it's in Scottsdale, and I went there as a local, not a tourist, for all of you who want to argue boundaries and call me a moron.

I can't believe I'm giving a UPS Store 5 stars... But this place totally deserves it.   My stupid self had a pile of amazon returns who return labels had expired (unbeknownst to me). The gal at the counter went above and beyond to help me, letting me use their computer to log in to my amazon account to print the codes needed, calling UPS help line to see if they could reinstate the return labels, and then printing and packaging up the items for me.   .....all while promptly helping numerous other customers all by herself.   I made sure to tell the store manager, but dang she was great. Heck, if I still hired for customer service gigs, I'd have offered her a job on the spot!

Another yelp success story... Spent a silly amount of time trying to figure out "my" new car shop.  Yelp to the rescue!  I emailed Whitey's through their website and got a reply within the half hour - wow.  Back and forth, Scott answered a few questions and confirmed they could fit me in for a brake job the next AM and yes, they could also drop me off at work.  Scott had provided a quote sight-unseen, and when they called me after checking my car out and before performing the work, it turned out the job was $15 under quote.  1) That's never happened in the history of car services for women and 2) what a happy surprise!  They finished the work and again called me, and we decided I'd give them a buzz at 5 and have them pick me up.  Cheerily the same dude who dropped me off in the AM came and grabbed me, and my car was ready to go when we got back.  I was offered a bottle of water, my bill was ready, and I was professionally but cordially addressed by name.  No kidding, 5 stars.  PS It's so nice to drive a SILENT car and not the embarrassingly squeaky one! :)

When I used to live in the Scottsdale ghetto, I was just around the corner from Prankster's.  Love love LOVED the place....cheap beer, friendly staff, TRIVIA!  What's not to like?  I did have one bad experience here though, but that was due solely to my accidentally double-booking and having 2 dates (one on each side of the bar) at Prankster's at the same time.  'm fairly certain I got caught early in the night, but was drunk enough I just kept denying!  Oopsies!

I absolutely love this place but my most memorable time here was with my cousin who decided she had to get plastered after hearing bad news.  So, being the caring family member I am, I opted for the same beverage she ordered--a Long Island Iced Tea.  In my previous experience, a LIIT is usually somewhat drinkable, however, Thai Thai must have only thought a Long Island is made by mixing whatever alcohol you have in whatever quantity of each you feel like.  HORRIBLE TASTING!  But man, was I hammered!!!  Anyways, the food is great, can't say much about the actual restaurant inside as I've always dined on the patio.  Contrary to a previous review, I have never been charged for extra rice, but maybe they just liked me? ;) Some of the appetizers are extremely pricey for what you get though, but the rest is pretty normal Scottsdale prices.  Bottom Line: Best Thai in Phoenix

Pretty small outfit, but the great staff fill the space with a selection of electric and acoustic guitars, and more importantly their knowledge and skill.  You'll see a slew of recently-repaired guitars, waiting for pickup -- a testament to their abilities and fair prices.  I dropped of a hand-me-down guitar for a set-up, hopeful that was all that the old gal needed.  A non-rushed order, they called me a two days later (one of the days was a holiday, even!) to let me know she was indeed in poor shape and I'd be better off buying new than spending unnecessarily on a crappy guitar.  I ended up getting a new guitar elsewhere (no negative on them...I'm just cheap and went the online/no-tax route.  However, my new shiny geetar needs a setup, and I know just the place.  They also give lessons, I believe, but I did not inquire during any of visits.  That's not to say I won't...anyone who has heard me play knows I'm in great need of more expert advice and tips!  Please, please, please, please, please spend your money here rather than Guitar Center.  That place is insanely horrible.

I love that Yelp asks me what keeps me coming back....  Well, I can assure it is not because of: - customer service, - cleanliness, - quality produce at great prices, - quick checkout service, - friendliness, or - easy in/out parking  ...because you will not find that here. Unfortunately, this is the closest grocery store to me in my 'hood, so I come here only when I need one thing for a recipe or if I need some processed foods for some reason.  Otherwise, Sprouts, Target, and even Food City are preferable to this dump.  How they spent a ton of money on a remodel and it's still disgusting is a true mystery.

I will not apologize for my obsession with Taco Bell!!!  Three words: cheesy gordita crunch.  Staff seems genuinely happy to be there and doles out more than enough sauce whenever I request "a ton" of mild sauce.  This location hasn't been updated, but as such, has a nice outdoor seating area.

Dairy Queen - the terrible treats I grew up on and was given as a reward for getting good grades and such.  Nowadays, Dairy Queen, or more specifically, a Dairy Queen Blizzard, is my regular self-reward for a job well done, a job done poorly, supreme happiness, a bad day, etc etc.  I honestly don't understand how a blizzard (Snickers, to be exact) tastes so much better from Dairy Queen than a similar packaged grocery store ice cream or some of the copy-cats out there.  But it does!    This location typically has a drive-through line almost to the street, and parking in the tiny lot/drive-through area is a mess at best (if you park and go inside, the drive-through line snaking around the building will unfortunately completely block you in).  But my order has always been correct and the drive-through moves reasonably fast (unless you're behind someone who got a hot food order, in which case, get comfy!)  Staff are friendly, as well, even though it seems like they are always slammed.  Budget tip: sign up for the DQ email list and you will get I believe 6 buy one, get one free coupons via email.

What's this?  Another opportunity to write a review describing how much Lowe's sucks?! I'll take it!  Lowe's is basically across the street from my house.  But I zoom on past that monstrosity and keep on cruisin' to Ace, the Helpful Place!  It seems they have as many staff members as Lowe's, despite being much smaller in size (perhaps the difference is that these workers are friendly, helpful, AND knowledgeable!).  They have a few checkouts, and none of those stupid self check-outs that never work.  Check-out is fast, super friendly, and efficient.  Pricing is a tad more than Lowe's and Home Depot, but it's worth it not to want to murder myself and/or others after having dealt with the morons at Lowe's.  Selection is surprisingly adequate though I do leave my gardening purchases to Home Depot.  They usually have a $5 off $25 Yelp check-in offer, and I'm also a frequent recipient of similar coupons in the mail.  Many thanks to Paul and his great staff!  THIS is how a neighborhood mom and pop should be run!

Damn, I miss this place!  I used to live at the Quad's apartments (big mistake) but on the plus side, I was less than half a block walk from this place.  When I moved to Scottsdale and had to actually drive to the place, the parking did kinda suck, but it's not as bad as everyone else makes it out to be--there is a small lot behind 4Peaks.    All the food is freaking amazing!  They have daily specials which can be hit or miss based on principal alone (I'm semi-vegetarian and I ain't gonna eat beef), but unfortunately all the hits I've experienced I never again saw on the daily specials again.  They also have a beer float, but I'm just not that adventurous...  The Stoutimisu is excellent, but HUGE!  Great patio with both misters and heaters, depending on the season.  I even had my going away party at the Scottsdale location, that's how much I love this place!!

Love love LOVE this place!  A few years ago when I worked at Sky Harbor, they were one of a VERY few places that would actually deliver to airport businesses, so that was awesome.  When not working and stumbling along Mill, you can't go wrong here.  The staff will laugh at your drunk ass, but put up with you reasonably well.  A few seats outside and a bunch more inside. Shitty parking if it's late on a weekend, but if you're picking up (what I had to do as I personally lived outside the delivery area) you might luck out and catch a spot as a delivery driver is leaving.  I still have my punch card (only needs one more  til my free sub!) for the next time I'm in town...I only hope they still take them whenever the hell that  is!

The good:  -cheap at $84 a credit hour -multiple testing centers around the valley that have extensive hours -online course management system works well  The bad: -run like a business so poor advice is given to uneducated students and young students, to their detriment -Deals with Pearson are presented to look like they save the student money, but it's not - this makes the used book market for Rio Salado textbooks practically non-existent (hello, craigslist!) -online science courses are specifically designed so that students fail (not me, but a quick search only will confirm this) -some professors care, but most don't- expect 5-7 days waiting for an emailed question, in an accelerated course.  Hope you didn't need to know the answer. -online course materials are minimal, and no lectures are provided.  The embarrassing: -course material is reused without any review - expect broken links galore! -course material links aren't even original material to Rio Salado or Maricopa CCs -the few videos they have are done by someone who can barely string a sentence together *stutter this, correction that, 'um' 'uh', etc -course material is rife with grammatical errors (but if you happen to have complex sentence structure that is beyond the comprehension of your marginally educated teacher, you will incorrectly miss points) --- for example, please don't suggest to me to use a 'pneumatic device' to memorize something. It's just bad.  I was told Rio has something like 60,000 students. I promise you the vast majority of these are NOT graduating or completing something worthwhile (certificates don't get you jobs - do NOT believe Rio). PEOPLE, please please do your research and get past the online class convenience if you truly wish to learn. The other Maricopa CCs are NOT like this!

I am afraid to write this review, for fear of it becoming super busy!  If you are coming here for the decor you will be disappointed.   But if you are coming for some amazing food (and aren't a spice wuss), you will be blown away.  The service from the lone female server is always sweet and quick, despite a bit of a language barrier (...if you're a silly gringo who only speaks English, that is).  I shy away from meats, including the more interesting offerings here, but anything I've had that is vegetarian, or vegetarian after my slight adjustments to the menu, are delish.    Annoyingly closed on Wednesdays.  Bonus: keep up to date on your telenovelas while you dine!

2 stars for the fat smelly man who is ALWAYS there inside when I'm there (and who I constantly end up walking past all night) 5 stars for the fabulous patio 4 stars for the crazy, cute Irishmen my girlfriend and I stupidly offered a ride back to their hotel  1 star for the crazy Irishmen who wouldn't get the fuck out of my car 5 stars for the time my girlfriend made a paper towel "scarf" in the bathroom and paraded around the patio all night  Average that up?  3.5  (Total guess...you do the math.  I'll give the benefit of the doubt and round to 4)

Five-star,  indeed!  I purchased a groupon or livingsocial deal which was a punch-card of sorts for oil changes and such from a pre-defined list of service centers.  The facilities need a bit of help (we all got lightly "rained" on from the leaking AC), but the staff was friendly, efficient, and helpful, and even funny!  Yes, that's right, you get an oil change with a free comedy routine!  I'll certainly be back, of course, because I have my punch card, but also because they're great fun for the few minutes you wait for your oil change, AND they took my mobile number down so I can get a reminder of when Ms. Matilda (my car, duh) needs some TLC again.

Very divey - in the most fantastic way possible. Cheap beer, friendly staff, hilariously diverse clientle, bar shuffleboard!   I only hung out here only off nights (hello Tuesdays!) and have made out way too many times in the posh smoking lounge.  Oh to be young again (they served me when I was 18...)  ;)

Went with a meetup group, so we had a reservation for our group of 10 (reservations only allowed for groups of 6-10 folks), and we took up a good portion of the 42 seat place.  It was definitely nice to go with a larger group so we could swap slices of the different types of pie!  Three pizzas come with sauce and three are sauce-less, aka white pizzas.  The white pizzas can also be ordered with red sauce, but c'mon...do you really think you know this pizza better than the legendary Mr Bianco??  And don't you DARE ask for red sauce on the side because that just ain't happening!  Well...I tried the margherita...gotta stick with the classic.  It was definitely one of the best margs I've had before, but not the best.  Blasphemy for me to admit this in writing, I'm sure...but the crust was absolute perfection on this and the others I tried.  One gal did the unthinkable and ordered the Biancoverde with red sauce, so was able to try both the traditional white Biancoverde and her modified version. Both were fantastic (and preferable to my margherita!) but Chris had it right without the red sauce.  No shock there!  Parking situation is pretty tight but they have super quick and easy (and free!) valet at the ready.  All in all, I most certainly would NOT wait in line for hours, but for a quick meetup WITH RESERVATIONS it's a great spot.

Only reason for 1 star is 'cause I got arrested here for underaged drinking years ago.  I blame the Diamondbacks, for no legitimate reason.

I can't give this place 5 stars, since like most everyone else says, it's a nightmare.  But I have suffered through the experience to come up with some great, (amazing, really) finds.  Beware the purses though - TONS of them were fakes!!!  And make sure to THOROUGHLY inspect anything you are buying - for stains, holes, rips, etc  Good luck!.

Decent enough place.  I'm not a big fan of the Old Town Scottsdale scene and this is one place I could go without gagging on the pretention.  Food is nothing special but certainly better than typical bar-food.  Great patio!  To Melissa H below, what's wrong with Kansas bball fans??!  Rock chalk Jayhawk!!!

I may look like I'm in shape but it's clearly obvious to everyone else how little I exercise whenever I attempt Camelback.  Most recently I went a day after I had surgery (ok so it was my wisdom teeth being yanked out, but still).  Grandmothers, people with dogs, & children were going faster than me.  I've never felt like such a slug in my life.  Christ, there was even one chick who had a fucking parrot (yes a PARROT) on her shoulder the whole way up and down.  Thanks for making me look like a loser in front of all the hotties on the trail.... :(

I love the funky pink building. I love the authentic decor and traditional Spanish music that was playing. I love the cute little preggo chick that seemed to do it all (hostess plus waitress for ALL the tables). I love the food - tortilla soup and enchiladas for me and beef tacos for my guest.  Delish!  However... I do not love the bathrooms (seemed kinda unclean). and I do not love that they only offer chips if you order the guac.  Pardon me, but giving me several salsas before my entree but no chips is just straight up rude.  DON'T YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I LIKE, NAY LOVE, CHIPS?!?! It was practical torture, but I simply didn't have room for guac. We tried to pay for chips alone, but were again told we could only have chips if we bought guac.  Weird.

They have reallllllly hot miso soup!  I know that because the last time I was here, our waitress poured half of my miso in my lap. With no apology. And no offers to comp the soup that probably has left my ovaries unable to function.   But hey, she and the other staff are pretty so that's all that matters, right? Nobody cares about service or basic manners anymore, right?

The pluses: - Amazing happy hour. Seriously.  The flatbread for a whopping $6 is enough for me for 2 entire meals - Wine pours are $1 an ounce ($6 or $9 glasses) during happy hour.  YESSSSS! - Staff: male = hot + friendly, female = probably also attractive (I don't swing thataway) + friendly  The minuses: - Tons of people (a good sign, but not particularly helpful for me) - Parking  Side note: the last time I was here, lots of people were trying to use gift cards, probably received from the holidays, during happy hour.  They do NOT take promotional gift cards  (like those purchased at Costco at a discount...) for happy hours or other promotions, so beware.  I don't have a gift card 'cause the happy hour deals are so smoking, I can TOTALLY afford them like a baller!

Satanic shopping carts.   Unhappy children galore (damn you parents for not using the FREE child care! What is wrong with you?!?)  Cheap (I mean "affordable"?) modern-ish goodies and furniture.  ...which will undoubtedly have too many or too few hardware pieces.   And.... Meatballs.

This is one of those places that I don't understand how they are in business... I'm usually the only one in the store.  The prices are a bit to much more expensive than you'd find on a mid-price brand in say, Target.  But their catalog's are awesome and not just for the fairly regularly free product coupons - they often have cool cooking ideas, great pics, and some yummy recipes.  The recipes tend to skew towards Midwestern cooking (yes, that's intended to be an insult...) but it sometimes have some goodies.  If you are like me and look young and apparently not like you'd be spending 1.5-2x as much for spices as you would be elsewhere, I sometimes get completely ignored here (no greeting, no asking if I need help) by the older staff.  But there is one young guy, Zach (who either recently started working here or I've just happened to shop on his off days in years past) and he's freaking awesome!  Kudos to him for making the shopping experience what it should be - helpful when needed, gives you space when you don't, and all with a smile on his face.

I once got a fortune cookie with no fortune in it.  There were two ways to interpret this:  1) I had no fortune (true at the time) or 2) "Nothing"....in bed (also true at the time).

13 minutes, start to finish, during the lunch rush, no less!  I visited for the first time a few days ago, and let's just say it's not a good thing for my BMI that my office is less than a mile from here.  Plenty of vegetarian and vegan (!) options.  As a insanely and annoying picky quasi-vegetarian, I'd like to see more vegetarian options withOUT faux meats.  But, perhaps as I make my way down to that section of the veg options, I'll change my mind.  The place seems a bit more cozy (aka cramped) than I usually care for, but I'll be back for take-out and eat-in for the food and service alone.  Tip: there are two entrances. I came in the west side door and couldn't really figure out where I was supposed to order.  Make your way to near the end of the bar and you'll be at the register for take-out.

Clean, quiet, have plenty of available friendly staff and decent selection at this location.  Any items available for reserve online and you'll get an email when your item is ready for pickup -- perfect for expanding your music collection :)  Easy parking in the garage. Easy item returns in bins at garage or self-scan return at library entry.

Great guys here (there were only guys when I got a piercing here about 2 years ago).  They definitely know their stuff, and like all other piercings I've ever had, it didn't get infected, so that's always good.  The interior seems pretty barren compared to other places I had checked out, but it's crazy clean as are the tools used.  Additionally, immediately after the piercing when I got up, I halfway fainted and my piercer sort of caught me and didn't even try to grope (easily done and I probably wouldn't have realized it until hours later), so major props to him.

What Kristen and Shannon said...AND...my favorite-est part:  The "what's in season" pages which I tear our and which have a permanent home on my fridge.  If you love to cook and/or eat seasonally, or garden, Edible Phoenix is a must-have for that alone.    Edible (*Insert your town here*) magazines are great.  I've sought them out all over the country when I've lived elsewhere, and Phoenix's isn't the best, content-wise (sometimes surprisingly sparse), but it's still great.  I pick up my copies either at Jam in Scottsdale or Essence Bakery in Tempe.  Here's a link to the other locations for pickup: http://ediblephoenix.com/subscribe/find-a-copy/get-a-copy-of-the-magazine/  Also, their website is sooooooooooo slow BTW, almost brings me back to my 14.4 modem AOL days.

The dreaded letdown Restaurant Week experience...  From the moment we stepped in, I was disappointed by the service. The hostess was just weird - like a hybrid of nervous and rude.  The bread course server didn't know what all breads he was offering us.  One of my friends asked for a second cocktail early in the meal.  He never got it.  And no one else was asked if they wanted a refill, even though his and others drinks were empty pretty early in the service.  There were major lapses in courses and then a few in immediate succession.  We are tasting such unique things taste, texture, and presentation-wise, that you need time between courses to discuss them with your dining mates.  Two were so rushed I never was able to hear what exactly I was eating.  At least one of my table-mates shared my frustration on that.  The unique tea contraption was placed on our table and that server walked away without an explanation.  He came back later once it was ready, but we just sort of stared at it, wondering what the heck it was and if we were supposed to divvy up the drinks?  The food WAS inventive, whimsical, fun, interesting, delish.  But crappy service ruined that to where it was actually just uncomfortable for me.  I guess the only positive about the service is that I had no problems changing out reservation count a few days prior, and that our table indeed was ready when we arrived on time.  For being one of the alleged "best" restaurants in AZ, I left wholly disappointed and know I'll never return for a special event splurge meal.  Bummer, since I've only heard such great things about this place, both for food and service.

Have you ever locked your keys in your car?  With them in the ignition?  After grocery shopping?  And you now have 6 bags of shit that's melting, including ice cream?  Yeah...I was that idiot.  Thankfully, one of the workers went into their breakroom, jacked someone's hanger and finagled my car door open, and then refused money and a hug of gratitude!  Not a great fan of the store itself (usually kind of messy) but I am obviously appreciative of the staff.

The only thing that isn't awesome about this place is the parking lot...when there are folks in the drive-thru, there usually no way to get around that line of cars to park, so you just wait.  Oh, and the interior seat cushions are a bit worn (being nitpicky now).  The food is delish (or d'lish, I suppose?), healthy, and somewhat creative.  Definitely NOT your typical drive-thru fair.  I've tried a few different things (wraps, cold sandwiches, hot sandwiches) and I always keep coming back to the California Club (no bacon please!) for breakfast and lunch.  It's impressive they are able to offer many organic and.or local ingredients for similar pricing to say, Subway.  Depending on who is at the checkout, the service isn't always with a smile, but at least it's pretty quick.  And for a sandwich this good, I'm totally fine with that!

Living locally, I'd never had a reason to stay at a hotel in the area, but I was able to check out the facilities while a friend was staying.   The rooms are your typical size - no standard suites - but they are nicely appointed with a flat screen and small stereo system. The decor is functional modern and pleasing to the eyes... It's sort of like what I think the Saguaro was going for, only 3 Palms doesn't hurt your eyes with rainbow-vomit-Modern decor.    Depending on what side of the hotel your room is on, there is on-street parking only (or else you'll just have a slightly longer walk to the parking lot).   Front desk staff is stellar!  If I ever have guests and no room, I'll definitely  have them stay here.

For a furniture store this place gets a score of zero stars as they don't have any.  As a home decor store I give it a two, because at least they carry those items, atrocious as they may be to the senses.   We walked in and right out, as the smell of something (candles? Potpourri? Formaldehyde?) was so overwhelming I had to get out of there ASAP.   Maybe you'll have better luck or not as sensitive of nostrils. Regardless, definitely not a furniture shop.

A bit nicer than just an A-OK.   Produce is hit or miss (mostly hit, believe it or not).  If you want anything for cooking Mexican food, you'll find it here, and for a cheap-o price.  I haven't experienced any issues with cleanliness, unpleasant smells, or rude staff. I get smiles and chit-chat from the cashiers when checking out, and I'm clearly a white girl.  I don't come often, however, as their cheese section leaves me longing for Sprouts or Trader Joe's, and apparently cheese is about 1/3 of my diet. :)

Love it!  If you're a member, you get coupons in the mail, and occasionally coupons for free stuff...something Sam's doesn't do.  My friend first told me she thought she might be pregnant here.  (I suggested she get the Costco sized variety pack of pregnancy tests but she thought otherwise...)  Accepts credit cards, but only AMEX as far as I know.  I get my tires, much of my food, my TV, some clothes, booze, plants, etc all  here.  I heart Costco!  (One good thing/annoyance is when you get tires, they fill them with Nitrogen.  Lasts a long time, but most of the quickie oil change type places refuse to put regular air in your tires when you need a fillup..even though it's supposedly ok to do so)

I'm sure this little tid-bit of info is included in the membership agreement we all sign....but I didn't know this until last week!  Prices are guaranteed for 30 days...so if you buy a $1k tv and it goes on sale, or has a discount in their coupon book, just bring your receipt and they will give you the difference back in cash, no questions asked!  This is for EVERYTHING!    Amazing doubled factory warranties on items, 90 day return policy on electronics, and friendly staff.  SUCK IT, SAM'S!

Josh is completely correct! This is by far my favorite "fresh-Mexican" type of place, and it is by far superior to Chipotle.  I always order the Daily Special (which they have had every day I've gone?) of the salmon tacos with rice and black beans.  My understanding from over a year ago is that they weren't doing so well with sales, so I'm overjoyed to hear from Josh they are packing it in during lunch!  Hopefully they will still be there when I move back to Scottsdale.  They aren't open every day though, as I found out during Superbowl weekend, so you might want to call first...

Yep.  It was that great!  Service was flawless - immediate refilling of glasses before they were below half full, waitress heard me comment about temperature and immediately offered a sweater (which was needed), drinks were quickly brought to the table (and my mixed drink was described with a few extra details to ensure it's what I was wanting).  Food was perfectly, and I mean, PERFECTLY cooked.  Grabbed some of the peppercorn sauce for my smashed garlic potatoes.  While the taters definitely stood on their own, I'm glad to have had the crazy delish gravy to douse my potatoes with.  The veggies of a single carrot and snow peas were cooked fine, but being a veg-head, I'd have wished for a lot more.  Regardless, my filet, potatoes, and veggies were more than enough for an over-the-top gluttonous meal!  The manager stopped by the table to make sure everything was to our liking and cooked correctly.  Even valet was seamless with the experience.  Based on some of the reviews, I was concerned we'd find our steaks under-seasoned, and I even thought about asking for extra seasoning.  Alas, it was absolutely perfect as is.  Definitely a splurge-worthy meal!  Bonus: the happy hour offers discounted cocktails and free steak sandwiches...we didn't imbibe since a steak sandwich before my steak meal seemed a bit over-the-top-fatass-American.

Like every other TJ's, the staff is superb!  Can't find something?  They'll check in the back and bring you a few of that item.  If they're out, they'll suggest something new but similar to try (many times making you a convert).  Looking for a wine you fell in love with at a different TJ's across the country?  They'll order it for you...with a smile and a joke to boot.  Check out the website for a sampling of great recipes and a copy of the seasonal Fearless Flyer which highlights new and featured products.  I will never, ever live in a place without a TJ's!

How does one quell their irrational "I'm about to die" post-medical-symptom-googling??  (No, NOT more cowbell...)  I had a nasty looking bug bite, a mild fever, and abdominal pain. According to the internet, I was about to die from a brown recluse spider bite.   According to the nice, knowledgable and speedy folks at Statclinix, I have a boring, run-of-the-mill bug bite and a mild viral something or other.   Stupid name/spelling, but my new favorite place to go and get assurance that I'm not knocking on death's door for a lame ailment, for a far cheaper price than at the ER.

Only downer is they don't have a huge selection of frames to choose from.  Alice helped me on my visit (I already had my Rx - she laughed that it was in Spanish... and didn't fret that they couldn't verify it with the doctor in SA).  She weighed in on frame selection when I started to get stressed about picking new glasses and was 110% helpful.  I was told they'd take about 2 weeks to come in, but I received a call only a week later and they were ready.   I had worn contacts in, so they gave me a case and some solution to remove while I got fitted for the new glasses.  I had a bit of trouble seeing far away, so she made a few adjustments, fitted them properly to my face, and off I went.  1000% better than Lenscrafters.

Much smaller than the Whole Foods a bit further up north off Scottsdale Rd and Mayo...so a slightly smaller selection overall, and a much smaller selection of freshly-prepared foods.  BUT that means a fraction of the customers at the other location, easy up front parking, great service and NO lines at the cashiers!  Dionne at the cheese counter is especially wonderful!  They have a nice selection of sampler cheeses if you will (my term, not theirs) of smaller hunks for sampling.  Plus, if you want to try something new, Dionne will not only slice up whatever you like, but suggest others for you!  Felt like a kid in a candy store...only with delicious cheeses!  Here's hoping the Raintree location is able to stay open.

Great group of dudes - always happy to quickly diagnose issues, in my case a dying car battery.    A quick lookup of my warranty info (from 2006 - I certainly didn't still have that receipt!) and I was good to go with the new one installed at a pro-rated cost for replacement.   Only thing missing is their ability to save all my radio presets after disconnecting the battery :)

Overpriced?  Probably, but I'd rather pay more for 1 cupcake than make my own for the same price and have a few dozen cupcakes at the ready (no will-power here).  They have cute seasonal frosting toppers (check out some other Yelper's photos to get an idea...). They often have options of which topping you can get on a specific cake, such as the standard dot and plain frosting or a sprinkle option are available for the chocolate cupcakes.  Cakes are NEVER dried out like some other places (and admittedly, mine, sometimes).    They give about 4x as much frosting as I like, but it makes 'em look purdy.  Staff run this place pretty well, considering how busy they are.  Sometimes there's just a huge mass of folks inside, so it's hard to figure out where to stand to order, and then where to stand while they are packaging up your order so you're not in everyone else's way.  Parking is a bit messy; look out for the cupcake-fiending soccer mom in a SUV who doesn't know how to drive to cut you off.  Make it through that obstacle and you'll be on a delicious sugar high in no time.

Like others, Lowe's is much closer to me, so I come here, even though I prefer Home Depot.    Service from staff is extremely spotty. If you have a clue what you're doing, then it probably won't matter to you that your questions will be met with either a blank stare or a vague finger point to a section of the store.     However, if you are like me and only a casual home-renovator, you will be frustrated by the altogether lack of service, especially in the paint section.   Saving graces (and why this isn't a 1-star review):   - the great guy in tools/ hardware who let me borrow the world's smallest Allen wrench....this was after spending 15 minutes on the phone with a clueless guy who was dead-set on convincing me that 1/8th of an inch was 4 times smaller than 5/64th of an inch. Grade school fractions, anyone? - Hector, who works the floor and is very helpful when I'm being ignored by the paint folks (how come my cloak of invisibility never works when I want it to???)  Money saving tip: 10% off coupons are available online, and they also honor competitors' coupons.

Can't believe my prior review was 2 whole stars. I must've been high on paint fumes.  The ONLY positive is the clean parking lot. That's what happens when no one shops at your disaster of a store.   Employees are either idiots or completely do not care 1) about their jobs, 2) about customer service, or 3) about actually providing useful information to people.   It's honestly fucking baffling how they are in business considering their incompetence.   I come here because it's close to my house. NO OTHER REASON.   Not because I've been chastised for asking for the same number of paint stir sticks as gallons of paint I've purchased. ($35 paint apparently doesn't warrant a $.10 piece of wood).  Not because the employees repeatedly make up item locations when you ask where X is (8 rows off? Ask 'em about it and show him how he was wrong? Expect him to shrug and walk away after a f-you look)  Want landscaping advice? Ha! Expect a recommendation so bizarre that the plant is sure to die within a few days planting per their advice.   Special order something on a discount? Hope you don't actually expect the discount written on your order. After fighting for it for months you'll give up and pay so you don't have to talk to these jokers anymore.    Guess what. Home Depot is an 8 mile round trip for me. Lowe's is .5 mile round trip (including parking lot time). It's worth the extra 7.5 miles not to deal with them anymore.   FOAD.

Great lunch specials. But they add a gratuity of their choosing to to-go orders and will not remove it.   Shady as hell. Won't be back.

Goddamn this place sucks.  After waiting a glorious 4.5  hours to get my stupid license, I walk away with my fabulous brand new ID valid until 2048...only to find my effing name is spelled wrong.  I go back and tell genius that this is in fact NOT my name, and I need it fixed.  She referred me back to the line and said I'd have to pay $25 again.  Yeah...NO.  So I spent the next 4 years with my name spelled incorrelty on my ID.  As you might imagine, buying/selling both a house and a car with incorrect titles led to tons o' fun with lawyers.  Thank you, Tempe  MVD, for changing my name for me.  While I always thought "Katherine" was a long name, you added 2 more letters for good measure.  On the other hand, I looked smokin' hot in my AZ DL picture and was devastated to find the Ohio DMV makes you surrender your old license when registering there. :(

I agree that the timing here is great. I've only been once but they had a cowboy-ish old dude jammin' so that was pretty cool. I was here for a work thing with some people I had just met so I just spent the entire dinner wondering how the f was I  going to expense this...luckily  one of the dudes paid, saving my boss from having to fire my ass (upscale + North Scottsdale = Out of my price range).  I had a DELISH pumpkin soup that had some seeds it in for crunch, a side salad that wasn't too special, a chicken entree w/ mushrooms and a bunch o' beer.  We all tried one another's food and it was all good, though I can't remember anything particular. Definitely save room for dessert!  Pretty good wine selection, as noted numerous times by a particularly obnoxious wino in our group.

4 stars so yes,  "I'm a fan"...but not necessarily because the entrees were anything great (they were just "ok").  No, I love this place because whenever my girls and I were picking up carryout, the staffers would let us (or at least they knew better than to try and stop us?) fill up 64oz Big Gulp cups with salsa.  MMMMmmmm good.    Notice I said it was the girls and I.  Don't eat this much salsa if you're planning on kissing anyone in the following 48-72 hours....

There are two groups of folks you'll see on Pinnacle:  Out-of-towner/tourists  Locals with big lips/tits/egos  Regardless of which group the hikers fall into, everyone is very considerate and willing to move out of the way for those who are truckin' along faster than they are.  As others have suggested, it is NOT a loop trail, so it's a up/down/up/down and repeat kind of hike.  There are two mid-hike seating areas with look-outs and distances to the other area mountains - pretty cool.  Beautiful views, but that's to be expected!  Parking: park on the street.  Don't even bother trying the parking lot, as there are always several cars stalking for spots.   (Which BTW, I will never understand why someone who is about to HIKE A MOUNTAIN will wait 10-20 minutes for a parking spot to save a few steps...!?)  The only minus are those parents who bring their very young kids along and don't supervise them as they dart in-between people (or alternatively, the parents yell at them when they say they're tired/have to pee - stupid parents).

Note: I originally posted this to the wrong location. Guess I'm not perfect.  Bummer.  I'm a young-ish chick, bringing pretty nice vehicles in for washes, a few times a week.  I've yet to get the hard sell here.  As it's their job to make sure we, the customers, know our wash options, they suggest x, y and z.  I turn them down.  They quickly accept it.  Simple as pie.  They are speedy, friendly, and as for the interior vacuum and clean, no complaints there.  Exterior hand-dry is done very quickly and I've yet to see them miss a spot.  They have plenty of discount options that are automatically applied once you register your license plate on their website (you cannot do this in store, ONLY on the website).  I cannot attest to how well they are applied, because I bring in client vehicles and I'm not about to register someone else's car on my email address.  $.25 coffee and soda for officers in uniform is a nice touch.  Nerdy copper photos on their website though...  Tons of crappy trinkets inside the shop/waiting area that smells like 5000 different types of air fresheners mixed together.  Gag.  Plenty of seating outside means you won't smell like a cheap whore after you pick up your newly cleaned car.

Having unfortunately moved away from the Valley a few years ago, my first and only experience at SR was last week.  OMFG I am in love!  My girlfriend took me here literally first thing after picking me up from Sky Harbor.  Hell, they weren't even open yet, but the lovely lady (my friend said one of the owners?) let us in and served us right away anyways.    I had (don't laugh) the basil lime sorbet, pineapple sorbet, watermelon sorbet, and the mango margarita (I think that's the name).  SOOOOOO good, with the added benefit I can pretend it was a healthy "lunch" since they are fruit sorbets, not ice cream.  Side Note: (For anyone who's been to, and raved about Jeni's in Columbus, OH, you have NOT yet tasted amazing sorbet)

I'm conflicted. This place is super close to my house, the staff is super friendly, and they always have my to-go order ready when they promise. They've never messed up an order and the food is always fresh.   The problem is I always end up with a headache after eating the food, so they must be using the dreaded MSG.  So if that doesn't affect you, you will totally love this place...but it does affect me, to the tune of raging headaches.  I always get the red curry with extra vegetables and no meat, medium spice. If you're a vegetarian, you'll see they don't have any meatless appetizers, except for the Thai egg rolls (good, btw), with plenty of sauce included for to-go orders.

A Trane unit for less dinero than no-namer units?  Yeppers!  They showed up on time for the quote.  They showed up on time for the actual installation, even with a 20 minutes heads-up call.  Quote wasn't some silly nickle and dime line-by-liner...instead it was an all-in $4500 for a 3.5 ton Trane machine, removal of old furnace, and all other little things required that I don't care about.  They laid down sheeting wherever they walked in my house and left not a trace of their presence.  They refused my offers of bathroom and even washed their hands outside via hose rather than inside (kind of made me wonder if people treat them like dirt/animals??  Regardless, these are GREAT people).  They used my programmable thermostat, using instructions from my computer that I pulled up -- no other company would do this, they all said they'd have to use their "free" but non-programmable unit and that mine wasn't compatible...BS.  Love that they offered to set mine up and spent extra time doing that.  My folks actually happened to meet the Flores folks during my installation and were blown away by their professionalism, craftsmanship...and amazing prices.  They actually just got their new AC and heater installed last week.  All in all, I got 7 quotes which was probably overkill. Flores wasn't the absolute lowest price, but all things equal, I got a larger unit than the lowest quote.  AND, a few salesmen from the rejected companies called and asked me info about who I went with and pricing, and they were all blown away by the price Flores was able to offer for Trane.  I absolutely could not recommend Flores Air Conditioning any more!

See original review for AC purchase/installation review.  THIS update is for follow-up/warranty service!  Today, yes, today, I finally turned on my heat (kills me to do so...) and well, nothing happened.  :-/  Brr, I think. Perhaps my batteries are dead-ish?  Nope.  Still nada.  So I call Flores around 2pm.  I leave a message and get a call 30 minutes later from Mr. Flores. I describe the issue, pass along me info, and he says someone will call me to schedule an appt.  I receive a call from Michael (who did my original quote!) at 3:45, and he is at my house in less than an hour.  It was a quick fix, something perhaps wasn't connected properly on installation (props to admitting to a problem rather than making excuses as is the norm), and he was in and out in less than 3 minutes.  Superb service, and he made sure to talk me through some of the oddities of having a heat pump only (I had them remove my furnace completely and rely only on the heat pump for cooling and heating) to make sure I don't freak out if I am to see steam or get bursts of cool air in the AM.  Love FLORES AC/HEATING!  For those who keep messaging me to see how happy I am with Flores, I will be happy to sing their praises forever! :)

Besides having insanely fabulous cookies (mmm chocolate chip chippers), my glowing review is  more about the catering part of this location.  I was back in PHX for work and basically used and abused the catering manager (Susan was her name....maybe??).  I'd call her every 5 minutes, needing something completely different, sometimes having my own packaging I'd need her to use, etc.  It got to the point where I'd call, say my name, the staff would immediately give her the phone, she'd say ok, it'll be ready in 5...and it was.    This woman saved my life (well...more my job, but still) and my sanity.

The awesome catering manager I was talking about is still there...and still awesome!  Catering orders $50+ they will deliver for a $10 fee. Ask for a catering menu and they'll include a 10% off coupon for orders $100+.  Love the staff!  Clearly they enjoy their jobs!

Um not sure whyTF there is a low-star review. Because it's fairly empty? Weird.   I start out here for my bike rides up and down the green belt. I've never encountered any vagrants, though some of the disc golfers have the homeless look going on.   A nice splash pad, lots of seating, and sometimes there are some teens (?) practicing music in the park.   Minus one star as this place is packed on holidays and some evenings, and these fellow park-goers don't seem to understand (or care) that the multi-use path is not a good place to let your young children run free on.

Absolutely A-mazing!    Duane just had surgery and is still recovering, but I think he's back at it starting this week - lucky me, as I've amassed more than a few unfinished projects in the past few weeks.  Honest, hard-working, and extremely helpful with advice.  He'll gladly give a recommendation for how to do something yourself or recommend someone else if a task is outside of his skill level...something which hasn't happened for me yet.

Happy hour review: - cool crowd - great specials on food and drink - great patio, plenty of seating and tables  Nightlife review: - leans towards douchebaggery clientele which means you'll get your ass or boobies grabbed if you're a lady (or maybe even guys?  Can't report out on that one) - bouncers are laid back and aren't huge jerks to the drunk morons - great patio, mostly standing room only since it's crazy packed  Overall, fun time as long as you are with some dudes to keep the brahs at bay.

Love me some green belt action!  There's not much to say that hasn't been said already, except for this (and listen carefully):  Do not expect a fun ride a day or so after a storm.  Right around the Indian School underpass it floods a lot, and fish tend to die right near the concrete, so it is super SMELLLLLLLLLLY.  Not the best when you're working out and taking deep breaths!  Otherwise remarkably clean and well kept.  Thanks City of Scottsdale!

I don't really want to kill myself when I come here like I used to.   In the past few years, something has changed for the better, and the employees almost seem like they care. (It's confusing; really)  If you come at 5:30, this place will make you contemplate going postal, but off-peak times the staff are actually really friendly, helpful and seem to care to help, including the dude named....Dude.  Picking up packages sucks a bit... If you get a package notice and come by the same day, if your carrier isn't back yet, neither will your package be available. Wish they had some way to communicate that easily, because it seems like every time I'm here someone else is pissed off that they can't get their stuff.

Easy to make an appointment (even a same-day one, at that!), staff is friendly, and they take a variety of insurances.  Once I got back in the room, I felt my nurse practitioner, Mary Frazee, spent MORE than enough time with me, and she was very knowledgable about my rare medical issues.  I was blown away by her expertise, friendliness, and concern.  Highly recommended on all counts!

My billing issue has been fixed. I've had minor issues with gift cards being applied, but they resolved them once I pressed.  I've been a regular for awhile now and they recognize me by name.   Only drawback now is I wish they offered specials and that my regular masseuse had more hours!

So, it's not exactly the epitome of clean. And they are randomly closed sometimes (such as my birthday on Black Friday - sorry not a holiday unless you are a Wal-Mart camper). And the staff isn't exactly smile-your-pants-off friendly.   But it's good. It's truly consistently good grub. Portions are large enough for 2 meals...but you will eat it all in one sitting (or try to) since you will have convinced yourself that the fry bread won't be as good reheated.  I'm still a bit bummed that my fry bread birthday tradition was hampered this year.   Note: It's hidden in a sad Mesa strip mall, with easy parking since it appears to be one of the few businesses still in operation in the strip. Seating is worn but ample.

This is one of those places that I always seem to forget to review.  I guess maybe because it seems everyone already knows this place is great!!  The important details you need to know: - Live music sometimes - Great happy hour food specials - Most wines (3/4 of the wine list) is $5 a glass before 6pm.  Use your Yelp check-in offer to drop that to $3.  YES I SAID THREE DOLLARS!!!!!! - Great bruschetta, burgers, and everything else. Chef's specials are often enough vegetarian so that's nice for someone like me - Great back patio that isn't super obvious to a first-timer that it exists - Clean bathrooms! You know all of the above doesn't matter in the slightest bit if the restrooms are nasty - Wine specials on the 5th of every month.  Now, I have never participated but I think it's like $2 for a specific wine. But since you can use the Yelp check-in offer, I haven't bothered since it's cah-razy cheap every day!!

I've been here for a few visits and I've never felt so much like the staff care and are on top of things!  Most clinics aren't too concerned with helping you out with insurance coverage. Considering the speciality nature of the clinic, lots of insurance approvals are required... And they make sure to take care of the issues for the patient, as well as keep them completely in the loop. The follow-up is phenomenal. Surely this step helps them make more money and reduces cancellations, but it also greatly helps the patient.   Also of importance is that my doctor is super, incredibly intelligent, but can also explain complex things in plain English to me.   If only all medical care centers were like this!

I've always associated the name Meineke as a Jiffy Lube hybrid with plenty of inane upselling.  NOT ANYMORE - this place is fantastic.  Nearly every customer is a repeat, and shockingly, the owners recognize a person by their name, face, and CAR (even as one person's mother's car when I was there).  I just got a simple oil change, and they let me use an unprinted, online coupon with absolutely no hassle.  No stupid upselling here - they noted my battery was on its last leg but didn't push the issue, saying it probably had a bit of life left it in, but that they could fix it now or when it really became a real issue.  Quite a refreshing change from every Jiffy Lube oil change where I am quoted about $2k in unnecessary work.  Appointments, even for oil changes are recommended, but they were able to fit me in no problem.  I cannot include the waiting area in my review as I just hung out in the garage and chatted with the other customers and owners while I waited.

Not sure what happened - I stopped by in the middle of the day, during the week.  No "hello" or "welcome", no "thanks", no "good-bye", no "can I get you anything else?".  I think all the cashier/barista said was "OK" when I told her my order of a mint-lemonade and paid.  I think it goes without saying that all else I got was a scowl.  After my order, she kindly set my drink down on the finished drinks area with nary a word.  As a first time visitor I figured out where my drink was, a few minutes later, as she was nowhere to be found to ask "hey, where's my drink??".  The space is decent, though the leather couches have certainly seen better days. Plenty of books to gaze upon while enjoying your beverage, but essentially no other positives as far as I can tell.  I will certainly never return.

You know when you get a huge plate of delicious looking food and all your dining companions comment that in no way could you ever finish all that food? A Taste of the Caribbean is like that. Only the food is just that good that you WILL finish your gigantor plate of grub!  They have only a few drink options (your typical Coke products, some tea and juice options).  The spot is super cute and bright, and reminded me of some of the hole in the wall joints I've visited on my Central American and Caribbean travels. I don't know about you, but brightly colored walls just make me happy!  My only complaint was some super Evangelical TV show was on. Sure, we probably could've asked for it to be turned off or volume down, but I didn't want to offend the adorable cook, "Mama."  Will I be back?  Heck yes!

This place has major potential!  As is, it's pretty much friendly super suck.  Adorable husband and wife team bickering in a foreign language? CHECK. Clean facilities and warm owners/employees. CHECK.  All personal recipes and made-from-scratch items? CHECK.   But..crazy interior, weak following of menu, long wait time due to every.single.item being made from scratch while you wait (except bread, of course) and gallons of mayo on sandwiches? Check, check, check and check. The poor folks I bought sandwiches for actually threw them away because they were so incredibly drenched and overpowered by the mayo.  Tried a second time, ordering something slightly different, and still nothing special.  Not sure why Yelpers are lovin' on this place, but I wholeheartedly disagree.

Two words: FOOD COMA.  How anyone spends the entire time here is beyond my comprehension?  We tried to hit all the hot spots where a line was expected (Kai, Hana, etc) early to avoid some waiting.  And we did a really good job to where we really only waited if we had a question for the chef.   We gorged...and gorged...and gorged...until we pretty much felt sick.  And my stomach was carrying a 6-month food baby. (Thank god I planned ahead and wore loose clothing!)  We focused on food and actually didn't drink...strategic plan to save tummy room for grub.  The event was well organized between the Art Museum, SAACA, and Local First.  Plenty of security, and no "bros" to deal with, at least while we were there.  Looking forward to next year! But plan ahead - GA tickets sold out months in advance!

Sue and Joe are amazing - never before would I have thought I'd find myself hugging my dry cleaners, but they are skilled and incredibly kind and caring!  I take things from sheets to fancy designer clothing here. Everything is ready when they say it will be. Intricate bead work has been treated with the utmost care, and they even took extra care to fix an item that required a ridiculously extensive hand-sewn fix.   Prices are reasonable, as are their hours of operation.   I honestly could not recommend this place more!

The SMELL!  WHAT THE HELL!?!?  So this is my first foray into Fresh/Easy shopping and I was met with an overwhelming smell of....something.  Maybe it was coincidental and client-based.  Maybe it was something outside.  But all I could think was OMG is that the produce or meats they're selling??  I ended up getting some packaged fresh green beans and a Thai rice heat and serve meal.  Both were fine (hence the extra star), but the odd smell will certainly keep me away in the future, at least from this location.

This BWW location is a solid 4-star-er.  Pros: -Wings and tons of sauces (my faves: honey BBQ, asian zing) -Offer low-fat ranch, regular ranch and bleu cheese for wing dips -Good happy hour food and drink specials -Tuesdays - regular wing specials -Thursdays - boneless wing specials -Service - I've ALWAYS had very accommodating servers and bartenders, including changing TV channel to a different game -Calorie counts on menus - make better informed decisions  Cons: -Noise level - it's CRAZY loud in here, even when there are no major games on -Misters do a better job of cooling down the area OUTSIDE of the patio than they do cooling the actual patio area. -Dry seasoning (in lieu of sauces) - avoid -Calorie counts on menus - you'll quickly realize you're about to consume 1k calories, minimum  They've also recently added a new position that is sort of a 'good time coordinator' if you will.  She will offer little beer tasters (though I found out that I cannot sip, but rather have to slam down any liquid given to me in a shot glass...oops.).  She also coordinates promo events and the wing challenge.  A few weeks ago, they had a competition where you could guess the USA Olympic medal counts to win up to 50 free wings...  And I won!  50 FREE WINGS!  Obviously I'll be back for my freebies and others.  Dietary tip: Get the naked tenders with your favorite wing sauce and sub a side salad for the fries to make a very filling meal for at least half the calories of everything else on the menu.  Thanks to my pal Paulie D. for that one!

Shell stations in Scottsdale, ESPECIALLY this one, are plain and simple, a complete rip-off.  I assume they are all the same franchise owner.  Thanks, but no thanks.  I'd rather run out of gas and have to call AAA to gimme a gallon than buy from this place.

Considering my affinity for the post office is akin to a root canal, a four-star review is sayin' something!  I have a PO box here, and upon sign-up, the customer service agent took me to the box to 1) show me where it was in the rows upon rows of boxes, and 2) to make sure I, with my small stature, could reach it on the top row.  Much appreciated. I occasionally get mail for the apparent last owner of my PO box, and that appears fairly normal considering the random other pieces of mail sitting out.  They SHOULD have a PO box reject mail drop because it appears most people are just throwing that stuff away...  For regular PO use, expect long, but decently fast moving lines at busy times.

I'll try to keep this short enough so that you can read my review in the time it takes them to make a sandwich...  Super friendly (expect every employee to greet you when you enter) Super fast (so fast you'll freak, as they say).  In fact I parked behind one of the delivery vehicles and my first thought was that I was able to be attacked when I heard this dude sprinting from the store to his truck. Super yummy - I get the vegetarian sandwich, no cucumber.  It has a nice zesty avocado spread.  PS. Minus one star as the Phoenix-area locations don't serve any of their sandwiches with sprouts (contrary to the menu).

Online customer service? SUCKS. Email customer service? SUCKS. 800# customer service?  OMG SUCKS  DIE DIE DIE In-shop customer service?  HEAVENLY!  Wait times for technical assistance are completely reasonable.  Staffing is more than adequate.  Service is quick and friendly, completed quickly by friendly and knowledgeable associates.  Melissa, especially, is an absolute gem.  TIP:  Most employers participate in the preferred employer discount program - sometimes up to 25% off your monthly bill and 25% off accessories.

I'm a fan as far as this being a nicely air conditioned facility adjacent to the Tesla superchargers.  As for the staff, they are most friendly (although exceedingly old).  Drinks = cold. SCORE. Fries = not great.  In'N Out is across the (busy) street, but it is too damned hot to cross the street while the car is charging.  Will be back..because of, you know, the chargers.

I've been to a fair number of Aveda-branded salons in the US, so this review will be a partial comparison to some of those (hence the reduced star).  The waiting area facilities (in the middle of the salon, pretty hectic rather than relaxing) and waiting experience (given a shot glass-sized dixie cup of tea rather than a large glass/mug of that delish stuff) are really the only things lacking... I think being on Mill/essentially on ASU campus might count for the differences as the typical customer isn't probably interested in those 'standards' that I have come to appreciate.  Also, every Aveda salon I've been to has nice bathrooms outfitted with their products.  The restroom facilities here were in the hallway and appeared to be shared with a few offices in the building (?). No nice products and pretty grungy looking IMO...   Now to the good stuff -my actual haircut: I requested Jessie per profile on the website and time availability.  She was GREAT!  Unlike some stylists that are either awkwardly silent or annoying gab-a-holics, Jessie has perfected that balance and was pretty funny to boot.  Also, of utmost importance, she actually cut my hair the way I wanted it.   Money-saving tip: check out their website if you're a first-time customer - you'll have several options of discounts.  I opted for the $40 haircut

This location is a completely no-frills FedEx spot. You can pick up and ship, but not a whole lot else.  While that may be a downside for some, the upside is that there is never a wait and the staff are super duper quick.  When you have a FedEx package coming to you with a signature required, you can easily divert your package for hold and pickup at this spot (which is really the only reason I ever come here).

UPDATE:  Looks like the health department can confirm my personal experience.  5 negative findings on their most recent inspection (http://phoenix.about.com/library/blrestinspectbad0613.htm). Meanwhile, the owners keep messaging me to get me to delete my review.  Oh Curry Corner.  I loved you since the day I met you.  Your takeout orders were usually wrong.  But I forgave you, for each time I came inside, my food was just right.  I was wierded out by your self-service beverages, and your water always tasted so awful that I drank tea or soda.  I figured it was a ploy to sell drinks, and I was OK with that, because your food was so cheap and so delicious.  I was excited to come in last week to find Guy Fieri's visit (can't stand the dude...wtf is with his hair...SERIOUSLY) prompted a major renovation.  Gone were the mostly disgusting and crappy booths near the kitchen.  Hardly an improvement to remove booths and replace with tables and chairs, but this was.  They cleaned it up. And it looked great!  Well, I was pumped that my friend, who is mostly an Indian food virgin, enjoyed this place and his first foray to the cuisine.  So much so, that (well, until he reads this review) I couldn't bear to tell him what I saw when we checked out.  A roach.  Not a dead one.  One still clinging to it's life.  Legs in the air like he just didn't care.  I immediately bugged (ha!) my friend who had originally turned me on to the place to tell him my woeful tale of a roach at Curry Corner.  OH, he said?  I saw one the last time I was there, but I assumed it was just a fluke.  No.  It was not.  And no thanks, CC.  I'm over you.

This place is so put together, organized and delicious that I had always thought they were part of a national chain, but they are actually locally- and family-owned!  Big props to the Mikha family!  They have plenty of vegetarian options, and I always make sure to get a side of their lentil soup - it's amazingly delish and fresh tasting!  It's sort of the opposite of George's... :)  Highly recommended and I will always come back!

I've been here twice now, and each time this place is packed to the gills!  The food is pretty decent quality, especially considering it is TOTALLY CHEAP! They have a small patio out front with plastic-y picnic benches, too.  They have a nice salsa bar that always looks clean (before I get to making a mess, that is).  I haven't ordered one, but the burritos are insane and make Chipotle burritos look teeny.    Free wifi, not that I used it.  Warning: the restroom looks straight out of the ghetto. AVOID!

Hands down, my absolute favorite venue in all of the Valley.  I've seen about 6 or 7 shows here now.  It's a very intimate place, where even from the seating (stadium bleachers, for reals) you are still very much "there".  Pricing, including fees, are very reasonable.  I've rarely paid over $20 for a show, and one at that price even included the artist's new album (thanks, Donovan Frankenreiter!)  The food looks and smells delicious, though I've never ordered any yet. Plenty of lunch specials are advertised via Facebook.  Yes, I am a Facebook fan as well!    I appreciate the help-yourself water and cups, so that the wait for drinks at the bar is not held up by a request for 10 waters. Mixed drinks (vodka press, at least) are an extremely reasonable $4 or $5.  Crazy cheap for a music venue. Beer selection is well-thought out as well.  Bathrooms are always clean and well-stocked...even at the end of the night.  Practically a miracle.  Staff is super friendly. Seriously.  This place has no flaws!  Parking is always an easy $5 cash payment at the lot across the street.  Easily accessible to the PHX Light Rail as well, but I've only gone that route once.  I notice most other reviews have lots of hipster references.  Can't say that I notice a huge influx of hipsters here versus other similarly sized music venues.  Could that mean that...I am.. *gasp*..a hipster myself?  Uhhh...I say nah...only because I don't own enough hats or mustache-inspired clothing/accessories to quality.  Yet.

This place wins the award for most dog-friendly patio in Phoenix!  I, uh, just don't have a dog, so this is more on the less amusing end for me.  But holy water dishes and panters galore!  They even have a recurring dog photo contest.   Now.  The beer?  Amazing selection and the happy hour pitcher special is nuts.  I love their HH food specials as well.  The pretzel with cheese?  Pretty sure I requested a straw and drank the rest of the cheese up.  I called it Cheese Soup to make it slightly more respectable.  I guess that's just what happens when you are "forced" to drink a pitcher of great craft beer!  The brunch special is pretty good, but on my most recent visit I ordered the grilled cheese and was fairly disappointed at my meal compared to everything else I saw....pretty paltry portion IMO.  I would've rather had a more respectable/substantial  sandwich and had no fruit and random sauce/dip.  The late night eats menu is a great addition of greasy yet delicious food at pretty awesome prices.  Service has always been another high point for OHSO.  But the bathrooms, UGH!.......I guess all those pitchers of cheap beers makes for some nasty drunk bitches, because my late night visits have always resulted in straight up DISGUSTING women's bathroom conditions. LADIES, GET IT TOGETHER AND STOP VOMITING IN PUBLIC.  WTF.  Only other negative is the parking situation.  I just hate valet.  Even if it's free.  HATE IT.  If you time it right, you may get lucky, but even when meeting friends at say, 4pm or so, I still get stuck valeting. But hey, this place is packed, for good reason.   I'll be back!

I had a stupid, long, annoyingly complicated billing issue that spanned several months and to which my phone resolution was not satisfactory (to me).  I thought maybe I could go in to the store and actually get something done.  Through no fault of their own (as I understood and believed from the manager...) their hands are basically tied and only very small amounts of credits are allowed.  So, I got a small bit of money back (not the $105 I still believe I'm owed and now know I will NEVER receive), but I was treated kindly, fairly, and quickly (shocking, for a Saturday afternoon).  Kudos to the very patient and busy staff!

Dear god we eat here all the time... probably too much, but it's close, convenient and yummy.  Food is flavorful, fresh, consistently good.  Service is good, with a smile, and usually pretty quick.  Great patio (no misters if you get toasty in the 6-months of PHX summer), and great runway view for airplane nerds such as myself.  Only complaint is the menu is quite small and fairly limited for vegetarians (grilled cheese sandwich and a wrap plus your typical salads).

So...Yelpers get a bad rap because people complain about stuff when something isn't perfect, yet they didn't try to get the situation rectified.  Here's an example of a problem and a perfect and nearly immediate solution from a franchise!  Kudos!...   My initial experience with Which Wich wasn't exactly awesome.  I ordered 2 sandwiches online.  You are promised an email confirmation.  I didn't get one.  No worries, 'cause the order is under my name, and I know I'll have no problem picking it up on arrival.  Got to the shop, my sandwiches were ready!  Score!  Brought them back to the office and my co-worker's was perfect, just as ordered.  Mine?  I literally had nothing on it.  I ordered the tomato/avocado with a smattering of toppings and sauces.  I got bread with tomato and avocado.  Dry.  Sad.  And worst of all, no cheese!  Apparently the online ordering system has some kinks to be worked out.   Annoyed and mostly hungry, I sent a belligerent email to Which Wich about my "shitty sandwich" experience. (Not proud, BTW).  Within 20 minutes, I received a phone call from Peter, the franchise owner apologizing for 1) not getting my email confirmation which would have alerted me to the ordering glitch, resulting in the incorrect order and 2) an offer to come back whenever and get my sandwich corrected, gratis.  Well, I went back the next day and ordered in person (not about to try the online thing again!). The staff was friendly, didn't make me feel like a cheapass for getting a free meal, and hey, my sandwich was perfect this time!  Thanks, Which Wich, Peter, and your awesome staff!  Bonus: sign up for their emails and get some decent special offers (not all crap like some fast food email lists)

Most frequent travelers know that PHX is one of the very few airports with REAL dining choices!  No, not the typical crappy national chains (with increased prices), but good, local-ish chains!  This particular Sauce location is located outside of security which is great because it doesn't matter which concourse you're departing from, but it does mean you'll be tempting everyone in the security line with the yummy wafting smell of your pizza.  Employees are helpful, friendly, and accommodating.  I was offered a drink, gratis, while I waited for my pizza to cook.  Back in the day, Paradise Bakery was my go-to Terminal 4 grub.  No more- they've been replaced by Sauce!

I was a regular at the Paper Source in Alexandria, VA - it was right down the street from me on King.  And it is HUGE!  I also love Kate's Paperie in NYC, so that's why this particular Paper Source only gets 4 stars, instead of 5 - this place is TINY!    I've been here twice - once during the Grand Opening, and again another Saturday.  Each time, I had to maneuver my way through the displays and other shoppers.  It was pretty frustrating the setup and small venue (again, as compared to their competitor and another store location).  For realistically not much more $$ than say, a Hallmark card, you can get cute, quirky, and fancy greeting cards - singles and in packs.  They also help you design event invitations, but I've never needed the service so cannot report on the pricing there.    They've already stocked the 2013 calendars - these are absolutely my favorite and they make great gifts.  Each of the larger calendars has instructions on how to make a paper craft out of each of the months past, and some of the other papers sold in the store coordinate with these graphics.  Last, beyond the crafty goodies, they have a great selection of cool/cute gift items - eg aprons, mugs, desk clocks, small kids (adults, too!) toys, and lunchboxes, to name a very few.  This is a great place to find a consumable gift, and the shopping bags and packaging make for free gift wrapping.  Love this place - just expected a larger, more spacious location!

My go-to grocery store (well here, and Trader Joe's for their specialty items).  This store has completed it's transition to a Sprouts (was a Sunflower Market until last month).  All the signage, indoor and out, is there.  It seems like they actually hired a few extra people during the transition, and the new employees are just as friendly and helpful as the original group.  I get essentially all of my veggies here - they always have pretty awesome specials like 3 red bell peppers for a buck (last night) and cilantro and green onions are always around the range of $.50 for a bunch.  Quite a variety of sprouts are offered as well, but they seem to often be out of alfalfa sprouts, causing me to venture into Fry's occasionally.  Wine and beer selection is also pretty great.  And whatever staff member checks you out will probably offer a nice suggestion based on whatever boozy delight you've just purchased -- definitely love trying new things!  The bulk section is also pretty substantial, however I don't peruse it as often as a I probably should...  Overall, absolutely a great local health market, with much more reasonable prices than Whole Foods.  The main difference is of course the size and a major lack of prepared foods (especially sushi and vegetarian options).  BEWARE: I learned the hard way that overnight parking is not allowed in this shopping center.  F' the property management co!

So much Yelp hate for so much beer.  Came on Friday after work and it was already buzzing (as were probably a few folks as well).  It's deceivingly small and I had to stand nearly the entire time.  However, the servers making the rounds provided surprisingly excellent service.  When I was nearing the end of a drink, someone came and asked me what else I could get.    Both myself and a pal signed up for the WOB loyalty card - $15 and they keep track of your beer consumption (including provide eligibility for awards like t-shirts) and gives you 25% off on Tuesdays.  Lookout BWW, WOB is my new Tuesday spot!  It may be growing pains or just general apathy, but I don't think the staff really know a lot (or anything?) about the beers as I was told that a specific beer had been labeled "unique" because it didn't have any taste (??).  Granted, I couldn't rattle off details about 500+ beers either, so this may be a dumb observation.  I also came on a night without live music, but it looks like the top floor is reserved ONLY for that.  I feel like they should open that up for a bit more space.  And I also wonder just how freaking loud would this place be with a band?!  I recommend you follow their Facebook page for details of their Thursday Ladies' Night specials, live music, giveaways, and events.

I'm basically obsessed with this place.   Truly life-changing Thai food in a tiny, unassuming spot on a pretty empty street in south Phoenix.  I've tried the chicken satay (large portion and STELLAR peanut sauce), lemongrass soup (amazing with level 3 heat - just enough to warm you up but not overpower the flavors), pad Thai (ok...never been my favorite dish), and several curries (all are great!)  A handful of tables inside and minimal AC (if at all?  Lots of fans going and moderately warm but not hot to me).  Quick service from the one server/cashier.  The epitome of a great hole-in-the-wall spot!  Bonus:  Got our waitress to write me a little note in Thai to take with me on my upcoming trip to Thailand!

Damn am I excited this place is finally in AZ!!!!  And I didn't even experience any sort of newly-opened growing pains on my first visit!  When living in DC I ate Potbelly (mushroom melt, extra hot peppers!) a few times a week.  Finally, the deliciousness has arrived in the Valley!  Great chocolate chip cookies as well - prepare to be the 'hit' at the office if you are so kind as to bring some to work.   I've never had their shakes but I know they have quite a following...  They also have convenient and VERY affordable catering that we used often in DC for meetings, but I haven't tried it here.  Affordable. Delicious.  Friendly, welcoming staff.  And the perfect vegetarian sandwich.

Really surprised by the low reviews for this  spot.   Pros: It's not your typical crapola airport spot.  It's not that much over regular Pei Wei prices (everyone airport spot raises prices by 10-20%...travel even fairly regularly and you should expect this) You don't have to question the meat source like at McDonalds or worse. Food actually tastes good.  Meat looks like meat, veggies look like veggies. Well packaged and plenty of napkins provided.  Cons: It's not $4. It's not as fast as a shitty fast-food burger. There isn't adequate waiting space for people, so you feel super awkward and like you're in everyone's way while waiting for your grub.  Wash: Super salt bomb...3x your daily recommended allotment but good to prompt you to replenish your body's non-alcohol fluid balance.    Honestly, I think the low reviews are because everyone is hung the F over and cranky as shit.

The more I come here, the more I like it.   Most prior visits (all happy hour) suffered pretty bad service... Wrong drinks, problems with the bill, absent servers.   Not anymore!  I visited for the first time in probably 6 months and I was shocked with the turn-around!  Our server was ON THE BALL. We had a group of folks on the patio, and I never found myself waiting for anything. An extra side of ranch for my half priced boneless wings (boneless bbq  were awesome, a pal had traditional and didn't love them) seemed to appear 20 seconds after I made the request.   We had a cake for a birthday and they let us borrow a giant knife for cutting as well as happily providing plates and utensils. Sure, every place does this, but sometimes with a touch of reluctance.   The happy hour special is great - lots of the top appetizers are half off, all martinis are just over $5, and they have beer and wine specials as well.   I love the large patio, however this sun worshiper wishes they had less umbrellas (but I'm probably in the minority).

Super-duper cool addition to the Biltmore!  Most vendors appear to take credit cards. Pretty spendy, as one might expect, but there are some gems to be had (fairly affordable jewelry at at least one vendor.  Other than jewelry, this is a great place to get consumable gifts (candles, beauty products, foodstuffs and the like).    Not so great for the kiddos - some vendor "booths" are TEENY and super cramped.  In fact, I had to make several rounds of Union as entire booths were filled up with 2 or 3 folks and I didn't want to push past.  Bottom line -- I'll definitely be back, but mostly to window-shop or add things to my Christmas list.

Located within the new Union "shop" at the Biltmore, they have a mini-stand offering these fun treats (the new cupcake, if you will...or more realistically, the new way I'm gonna gain some pounds).   Cost - $3.28 with tax, cash. I paid cash so I'm not sure if they pass on a convenience charge for credit, but they did appear to have Square for credit charges.   I got a flavor I assume is seasonal - pumpkin with cinnamon buttercream. It was delicious! My only complaint being that the top of my pie was a bit squished into the top of the wrapper.   It looked like maybe 3 others flavors are offered, but perhaps that will expand in future weeks. I know I have my eye on the Mexican chocolate chile flavor!

Well, this was easy!  I'm going to SE Asia next month, and considering the random outdoorsy things I'll be doing, it's recommended by the CDC for me to get a very rare vaccine, as well as a more common one, Typhoid.  Sadly, only travel clinics really carry it (Japanese Encephalitis, in case you're wondering), and none of them take insurance.  Sadder yet, my insurance only covers the vaccine when given in-network.    After literally days of internet searches and countless phone calls, I came across the Little Clinic.  They don't keep JE in-stock because it's rarely requested and insanely expensive ($275 per dose...and you need 2), but can easily order it.  Well, that's what I did.  I put in the request to order, and they were great communicators, letting me know when it was ready to go. When I went in to get the shots, they were ready to go.    When I first walked it, I was pretty amused.  Based on how professional they'd been on the phone, I sort of assumed this was a decently sized operation.  It truly is a "Little" clinic. :) The one person working that day was the Nurse Practitioner.  I learned from her that they only have a receptionist 1/2 time, yet they have evening hours and are open on weekends!  What a great find!  They do take a range of insurances, shown on their website, and they also list their cash prices for the vaccination kept in stock.  Note: This place is TINY and really only consists of 1 room with a table and 2 chairs, and a lobby (I guess you could call it that?) that is open to the Fry's that it.

Extremely friendly and helpful staff. Large and open product area, and super open hair services area (2 spots, not sure if both are open for services or if one is only for classroom sessions as I saw today)  Bathrooms IMO are extremely subpar for an Aveda Institute, and the reservation call line is annoying (automated, have to select the Tempe location rather than just connecting you with an employee).  I haven't checked yet if they have online reservations up.   As with most Aveda institutes (except DC!) the pricing is spectacular for services. Because they are just opening they have some great specials going on, and their open house is August 8!

This place totally reminds me of the Tempe 8th Street Four Peaks location...and then the North Scottsdale location...before they got insanely popular.  You can actually hear people in here.  There are only a handful of TVs.  There's a huge stack of board games.  They have more beer options than the other locations.  Staff is friendly (expected at any 4Pks location).  Bathrooms (at least the ladies' is clean!...granted there are basically no females here but still, I appreciate a clean bathroom!) Patrons are beer peeps.  Love it.  They have a food truck daily on-site, schedule here:  http://www.fourpeaks.com/blog/index.php/events/tasting-room-on-wilson-february-events/ (link shows "February" but it seems to be updated every month)  Unfortunately, one time I was here the food truck vendor changed last minute and neither the blog nor their facebook alerted those of us pining for fry bread that we were SOL.  Luckily they have tons of menus for places that deliver, and Cheba Hut quickly delivered and filled my belly.   Outside seating is pretty decent, but if you're there for a happy hour, at least this time of year, the sunset will probably make your eyes bleed.

Sooooooo(oooooo...) delicious!  I came with a pal and his 3-year old daughter. Clearly, this isn't a super child-friendly place, but everyone - our waitress, the other waiters and waitresses, the hostesses, and the kitchen staff - did everything within their power to accommodate the wee one...including making a chocolate milk from scratch.  Ridiculous, and it got applause from the kiddo!  Being at the pre-opening, we had the opportunity to try a lot of different things...like a gross amount of food.  I'm not exactly proud of how much I ate.  We started with the crusty bread and oil, prosciutto (a HUGE pile), another pork meat I can't recall, manchego and prairie breeze cheeses.  While eating them, I wondered why our server didn't tell us which meat was which...and then we noticed they are actually written on the plate paper liner.  Duh....  I had the "healthy" salmon entree, which was cooked to perfection and the farro, cooked apple and fennel side flavorful enough that I wouldn't immediate think it was super healthy.   My buddy wanted the Korean Ribeye Cap but it was not available (noted on the menu that it has extremely limited availability), so he got the pork ribs instead.  It was a TON of food again, with a side of cole slaw that I ate.  For kids, we were given the option of grilled cheese sliders, burger sliders, mac n cheese, and chicken tenders, so slightly more options than I'd expect for a not-so-kid-friendly type of place.  My pal had the Bacon Bloody Mary and guzzled 2 of those.  I had only 1 cocktail - the Maria Pepino, which is basically a bloody mary with tequila instead of vodka, and garnished with a pickled pepper.  It was the perfect blend of savory tomato, spice, and acid.  The only "misses" for me was the iced tea (no one has plain iced tea anymore...no biggie, but please freaking tell me it's some nasty sweet shit) and the monkey bread, which was overly sweet and had a ton of apples that we picked around.  Our bill was an astronomical $110+ for lunch...which included 3 cocktails, a few appetizers, 3 entrees, and a dessert.  Would I be back for the whole she-bang?  Hell no...unless it's another gratis meal.  But will I be back for the sweet patio and a great cocktail and apps?  Most definitely!  FYI, the large patio space is deceiving...it is actually shared with the coffee shop and oyster bar (not yet open as far as I know), so I cannot imagine there will ever be a time without a large wait for group patio seating.  Lots of parking in the back.  Clean restrooms, but odd how they're set up... They are outside of the main restaurant portion, with separate doors for Men and Women.  But both doors take you to the communal sinks.  Why not just have one door to the restrooms?    Our meal benefited Make A Wish Arizona - the founding Make A Wish chapter, if you didn't know!

Totally delish!!  On my first visit, I was sort of concerned that this place was closed.  There was literally not a SINGLE other car in the lot.  And when I walked in (door was open...), I was the ONLY person.  Naturally, this is to be expected for a new no-name sort of place, but I wanted to trust my fellow Yelpers' enthusiasm for the place.  Props to Joel L. for his wonderful MUST/SHOULD order list.  My dining companion, Paul D. ordered based upon that list, and I went with a recommendation from our server.  Now for the good stuff:  I had hot and sour soup, while Paul had the egg flower soup. I tend to love hot and sour soup when I have a cold - the peppery vinegary goodness is perfect for curing the sniffles.  I'm pretty sure this is my new cold-fighting takeout!  I tend to eat vegetarian, so I asked our server what he recommended from my possible choices.  He actually suggested something completely different (mushroom mix).  It was SOoooo good!  It had a very light sauce which was not greasy at all - something that I've found is a rarity in Chinese food.  Paul had a bit, and even though he's not a weirdo vegetarian, he liked it.  Now for the crazy part.  Most people who know me know I'm annoying adverse to pork.  But Paul's twice-fried pork was so good, I actually found myself enjoying pig!  Even the leftovers (portion size = generous here), were great.  I hope Yelp keeps this place alive - it is that good!

I scored tickets to the Dear Beer Cocktail seminar (thanks Lindsey F.!), a seminar held during 2013's Arizona Cocktail Week.  The event was described as: "Beer Cocktails are a huge trend in the US and you don't have to look far to find one. With the growing interest in micro-distilleries and craft beer, they are being added to cocktails and not just at the Mixology bars. Come and taste some killer beer cocktails and learn how best to use beer when making a drink! If you ever thought about adding beer to a cocktail, you'll be sure and take away some good tips. Moderated by Andy Seymour of Liquid Pro. Panelists include: Robert Sickler (Master of Whiskey for Diageo), Brooke Arthur (Mixologist for House Spirits) and Adam Seger (HUM Botanical Liqueur)."  This and the other seminar sessions are being held at the Sands building (formerly Trader Vic's) at the Hotel Valley Ho.  I was one of the few (I think) that aren't in the industry, and just wanted to learn more about using beer in cocktails/mixed drinks, plus who doesn't love a little Sunday Funday day-drinking?  The seminar opened with the panel's background.  We sampled 4 completely different cocktails, with each creator giving some history and tasting details.  The beers used were Red Stripe and Guinness, completely different in most ways on the beer spectrum.  Brooke's drink, a kumquat shandy with Red Stripe, had notes of ginger and cardamon, and was my absolute favorite.  My favorite...until the last drink from Robert, which was a whiskey and Guinness concoction including coconut milk, coconut water, acai berry, and topped with cacao nibs, Turbinado and goji berries.  Seriously the absolute best cocktail I've EVER had.  EVER.  I want more.  For breakfast. Lunch. Dinner.  Snack. Whenever.  All in all, I really enjoyed the seminar and would consider going to others, despite not being in the food and beverage industry.  However, had I paid for the tickets ($25 retail, $15 with Yelp discount), I'd have been pretty pissed that the 1.5 hour seminar started over 20 minutes late.

Really manager, you want to argue with me when I was given clearly a days-old croissant and thought you should know?!  Not even worth arguing.   Extra star is because they gave me a small glass of water with no hassle. I actually wanted to buy their bottled water but it was room temperature for whatever reason.

The staff are extremely helpful (at least one seemed to still be learning the menu), knowledgeable, friendly, and maybe even excited about their new biz!  LOVE that!  The menu is extremely shrimp heavy, which isn't great since I'm allergic. I did learn that they COMPLETELY separately cook the shrimp from the fish (including labels on everything - so I knew they weren't just saying that and it probably would be safe for me to eat).  I wasn't too hungry though, so I just got the simple cheese quesadilla for $2.99.  It's pretty paltry to look at, but once you add your choice of toppings from the condiment bar, it's worth more than that, for sure.    The had an onion mix, cole slaw, fresh cabbage, pico, several salsas, several sauces, and a great selection of hot sauces to choose from.  Drinks include free refills (but drink station is in the kitchen so it's not self serve--not my favorite).  I hope this place succeeds. It's in a strip mall by Walmart (gag), and next to Subway and Panda Express (gag).

I always feel a tad silly reviewing a retail chain store, since they're supposed to all be exactly the same.  But that's not the case for this Tuesday Morning store.  If you've never been to a Tuesday Morning before, you need to know that this is a bargain-hunting type of store, kind of like a Big Lots crossed with a Home Goods...only it's organized even more nicely than Home Goods.  This location always has a large clearance section (think 20% off 40% off and so on) which is a little more jumbled, but the main aisles are super organized and neat.  Yes, I said a discount store is actually neat (don't expect this at other Tuesday Morning stores).  The staff (largely a group of older ladies) are super helpful as well, almost surprisingly so.  Bargain items to look for: outdoor furniture and accessories, small furniture pieces, luggage, kitchen stuff.

Service was sweet and friendly. But our waiter wasn't able to really assist with some menu item explanations and recommendations for my dining pals who were largely unfamiliar with Thai cuisine.   Spicy levels are 1-5, and I was reassured the medium was REALLY hot. Not true AT ALL, but he brought a condiment tray for myself and a few others to bring on the heat. (After seeing what was added, he recommended my ordering thai hot next time).   I was one of a few that had enough for take-away. Our waiter bagged everything up, including ample portions of fresh rice for both of us (a rarity and much appreciated).   Overall, I enjoyed my food, as did my dining companions. No one tried dessert, so I can't comment on my go-to (sticky rice + mango... It's not in season, sadly), but I plan to be back.

I love the food. I love the decor.  I don't love the careless employees who let us wait for almost an hour for our to-go food.  Cold food, cold fries, cold hearted.  Guess I'll stick to the food truck, lest I spend another entire lunch hour waiting on food that is ready behind a counter.

My best guess is a few Docs and NPs were unhappy with their prior practice, thought  they could do better on their own, and started up their own office.  And indeed, they have brought their wonderful level of care and stellar support staff to Shea Women's Care, with 100% success.  I previously had seen Nancy Jorgensen, NP at another N Scottsdale office, and I tracked her down here.  Even though it had been more than a few years since I've seen her (as I lived across the country in the interim), she sat down and made the consultation portion seem like a chat between girlfriends.  She cares, she jokes, she's knowledgeable, etc.  I also advised her that the visit was prompted because I'm soon to be out of health insurance. So she hooked me up with an Rx for BCPs as well as some samples to help me out.  I had some blood drawn, and the tech Carol was super sweet and caring, and making sure she'd only stick me once (which is a feat considering I'm a tough draw!)  Even check out was easy.  The gals up front were certainly busy, but took care of me in no time, and will follow up with me for a reminder appointment scheduling call a year from now.  Absolutely, 100% fantastic service, support, and medical knowledge!  Highly recommended (and in fact, years ago, all my gfs saw Ms. Jorgensen at my recommendation!)  SUPER DUPER BONUS:  They have REAL gowns to wear. None of that shitty pink plastic/papery crap here!

So awesome I had to write my review while I was still here, letting the food settle to make room for more!  They've only been open for 2 weeks now, so they are still pretty empty (taking the old space of Lao Thai). Quiet-ish pop music plays in the background with a few tvs turned to sports (sound off). Owner (or manager?) says they are working to get karaoke set-up so that will be hilarious in the future.   My "opening specials" were different than what is posted in yelp images, FYI. Regardless, I grabbed a $5 cab and ventured to the full menu for some yummy miso ($2) and the Blazing Alaska roll ($9).   The wait staff were super friendly and attentive.   I see myself becoming a regular here!

I loved the original location at the Borgata more, but the new spot is substantially larger, with a great covered patio as well.  I had my birthday here again (previously at the Borgata location), and while we were a large group, the service from one of our 2 assigned waitstaff was frenetic.  When trying to find out how we were to be billed, she was essentially complaining and being extremely pushy about how hard it is to split checks and she needed to know NOW!  My pals eventually deferred to me, where I reiterated that we weren't all just going to "throw credit cards in and split it".  Gimme a break! I checked before booking to make sure it was still OK to split checks. You're getting your large group guaranteed tip, so chill the f out and stop yelling at my friends at my birthday dinner!  The food was great, and the service otherwise good.  At another recent visit, our service on the patio was pathetic.  With empty drinking glasses, I eventually turned it into self-service and took our empty glasses to be refilled at the bar.  That should NEVER happen. Ever.  Drink tip: their version of the mule is NOT good...ask for a regular Moscow mule or order a different drink!

How to prompt Kate's embarrassment - call me out for being at your shop twice in less than 24 hours.  Briefly, this stuff is good.  Much better flavors than Rita's, for example.  The Bada Bing would be better if it didn't have chunks of cherries.  A flavor or two taste pretty artificial to me (which...they are so no biggie).  My favorite flavor, which is so rarely actually served, is horchata.  Pure. Bliss.  Just try to not get called out by the on-their-toes employees!

I'm a bike person. I'm in shape so I assume a solo gal going to a bike shop looks to the employees like an actual customer.   Walked in, browsed for awhile, and was not addressed or even acknowledged. So I left, without purchasing anything.   It's a shame as I try to shop at local bike shops rather than the big names. Plus the shop is well-organized and leaps and bounds above the interior at say, Landis.    But even Landis says hi and offers to help.   I'll be buying my $100+ cycling jerseys elsewhere.

Yelper's dogs are as unique as they are! I enjoyed meeting all the pooches and temporary baby-sitting one (until nature called...)  While I and my human +1 didn't have a puppy with us, we still had a blast mingling and watching the dogs chow down on dog-friendly Sprinkles cupcakes (just WHAT do they use for the "frosting"?!?!)  The human-friendly grub was great as well - macaroni and cheese (none of the kraft from the box crap here!) and some flavorful lemon chicken. Oh, and Sprinkles didn't forget us, either!  I had...3. But they were minis! DONT JUDGE ME!  We also got a mini art lesson and there was a dog sketch artist - the drawings were really cool!  All in all, a fun kick-off to today's Art Walk.  Thanks Lindsey and all involved!

I hadn't been to Nandini in its previous incarnation....but I'm glad other yelpers had, so when they had a groupon offer, I knew this was surely a good place! We came for a late dinner and opted to order fresh, cause ya never know with a buffet...  The decor leaves much to be desired (especially the ladies room) but the service is charming and friendly.  Their heat scale is legit IMO, as a 5/10 was about as much as my mom could handle and she's no wuss.

The staff are still very green and refer back to the manager for questions, but they are up and running as of this week, I believe, and they are totally hopping!  Maybe 4 or 5 tables outside and plenty of bright seating indoors.  Clean (open less than a week, so no shocker there), and their simply delicious and fresh food!  The salad dressing is their signature and available on all the tables. It's definitely not a light dressing though, so if you want something lighter, ask for the lemon vinaigrette on the side instead.  Download their app and get a free side of hummus.  Upload your receipt and get another free side on your subsequent visit.

Fab concept:  - Test out a new (well, new for me, as I hadn't been to Film Bar previously) independent cinema - Get your drink on with a generously gratis beer or wine of my choosing - Short Lease Hot Dogs oh-so-conveniently parked outside.  Plus....samples of their appetizers?  Heck to the yes!  Add in the excitement and anticipation of not knowing what filmed-in-AZ movie was going to be shown, and you have a perfect weeknight event!  Now that I know the movies don't actually have to be "based" in Arizona, i have some awesome ideas of what may be next.  And not to mention some great Filmbar date ideas should my online dating attempts pan out :)  Thanks Film Bar, Yelp, Short Lease and my fun fellow Yelpers for a great time!  PS - Where do we get the post-movie trivia answers??

I'm a fan of the Living Room in Chandler and this new location did not disappoint!   The menu is the same as far as I can tell, and the interior is similarly inviting.  There is a HUGE patio, however I chose to eat inside since it was pretty chilly outside. Unfortunately it was just as cold inside...  Considering I was the only person in there on a Saturday at lunch time, perhaps it would bode well for them to offer an early happy hour or lunch specials...or perhaps the word just hasn't gotten out yet.  I didn't love Armitage, but hopefully the Living Room will succeed here.

Just like the other location, this place rocks!  How they manage to make a spot feel so incredibly home-y, fun, and affordable is beyond my understanding!  A few folks weren't particularly happy with their grub (not a lot of meat/cheese), but for the price and considering they don't really have a legit kitchen, I think they were adequate.  While waiting for a few friends to show up, I battled a stranger to Mario Cart (sadly, my childhood reign is long forgotten), and there are a plethora of games sitting around ranging from Cards Against Humanity to Connect Four.  Sweet happy hour, though I think the beers were definitely not pint sized (I could be wrong).

Man, I am a huge fan - having never heard of them before their well-publicized 'free salad day' (still going on today, BTW), and being able to first try them out at a Yelp event.  The staff are super duper pumped, friendly and helpful, and the restaurant is bright and cheery.  I'm a mostly-vegetarian kinda gal, but I love even their citrus-grilled chicken (so much so, that I'm trying in vain to recreate it at home!).  You may make your own salad with up to 4 additional ingredients (not enough IMO, if you choose 'minor' ingredients like green onions and nuts/seeds) or go with one of their standard creations.  But even with the standards, which come in regular and large sizes, you may make minor substitutions with I believe no extra charge.  This is a great addition to Tempe Marketplace, located across from Chipotle and next to Noodles and Co (which I also didn't know had moved in - 2 great Colorado-based chains side-by-side).  Thanks again MAD Greens, I will be back - on my own dime this time!!!

They are officially open TODAY!  I lucked out and was gifted two free meals from their Facebook pre-opening promotions (and my mom couldn't use it -score one for me!).  They also are giving (maybe only today? Not sure) all guests a free refillable cup and promise a free refill for all of August!   If you haven't been to a Zoe's before, it's fresh-tasting, healthier fast food.  Their red pepper hummus is my absolute fave, and the chicken and salmon kabobs are the best.  For about $10-12, I get at least 2 full meals (if I'm not being gluttonous..).  With the chicken, you get 2 kabobs with veggies, plus rice, a side salad and pita. With the salmon, you get 2 kabobs with different veggies, plus a side Greek salad, raita, and pita with hummus. I do wish the chicken kabobs also came w/ a freebie hummus, but it's fairly cheap to add a small side or buy a full side for a few more bucks.  The staff is super chipper...such as my receiving a "You're welcome very much" in response to my "thank you very much" to an employee who held the door open for me :)  Money saving tip: download their app and upload your receipts. Nearly every time I have done this (for their other locations) I find myself with a 'goodie' notification. Also, you get a free entree on your birthday (with purchase).

We came in for a soft opening preview - whose proceeds benefit a great local charity, Crysalis - and really enjoyed our meal on the patio.   Our pizza wasn't served piping hot but it WAS delicious and like I remember from Chicago! It was served up to us by the runner.   They have several local beers and a few cocktails, though we stuck to wine and waters.   Our server Katia was friendly, sweet, knowledgable (including warning us that pizzas take 30 minutes and the cookie takes 10).   I expect it'll get a whole lot busier when they officially open, but it was a super enjoyable patio meal with yummy food and a relaxing atmosphere.

Super happy hour deals and fun karaoke in the bar area (separate from the main dining area).   The beef bulgogi is to DIE for... And the beef and veggie udon were great, too!  Highly recommended!  They are the same folks who run Bei!

I've dropped off multiple donations here. Each time, no one has answered the door and everything has been locked.  So...no chance in getting a donation receipt.  I've also tried calling as well and it rings non-stop with no answer. I could however, hear someone inside speaking who apparently decided to ignore me, on my most recent drop-off visit this week.  This place is one of the few (or only?) animal shelters that I'm aware of in the South Scottsdale, so the proximity is convenient for me.  But honestly it seems pretty sketchy that NO ONE is present (or will appear) during the day, nor does anyone ever answer their phone.  From their website, visiting the shelter for adoptions is by appointment only...via email.

This is MY hike.    I like it because it's not packed with people, making it easy to pick your pace and not worry about having to navigate crowds.  Also, an added bonus is less people = less people littering and leaving their dog's shit everywhere.  Sadly, trash and dog crap abound at many of the Valley's trails, but it's fairly under check here.  I take Holbert to the Dobbins Lookout, then go back down and rejoin Holbert to the end, and then take it all the way back down.  FYI: at Dobbins Lookout there are toilets (technically) but they are not plumbed and as such, the stench will keep you away.  I do wish something could be done about that...

Cool space. But unable to keep temperatures to a reasonable level during hot AZ summers. Sips and Sweets was fun but I was mostly actively trying not to faint rather than enjoying the event.   Maybe a great venue in the winter?
