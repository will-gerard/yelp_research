In my last 2 visits with my 2 vehicles I have found that the oil section is made of individuals who are not full mechanics and like to make false claims to get more money.  Case in point. On visit for oil and wash of a jeep the mechanoc came in and said we needed a $ 382 job on a  4 wheel drive that needed work.  This is fraud.   Lmao we dont own a 4 wheel drive and he argued with us that we didnt know our vehicle.  He came back in later and apologized that he got it confused.  NOT he was trying to make mkney on us.  Today i had an oil job and the mechanic tried to sell me a transmission job on my Z that has less than 46000 miles by showing me a circle with dirty water splashed on it.  Im done. Warning just get your vehicles washed there..

Great food.  Cozy and friendly service by Michelle.  Great referral from Telina.  Definitely will be back. And the #4 drink Telina suggested is great. Gotta try it.
