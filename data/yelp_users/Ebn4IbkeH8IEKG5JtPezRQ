I love this place. It is one of our regular stops. We LOVE the Baja Sauce. I would put that stuff on everything. Baja Chimi is amazing. I also love the Fajitas. They put green chills with the onions. Salsa is also good.

We have heard good thing about this place. So my wife and I decided to give it a try. Walking up to the restaurant was strange. It was really dark walking up from the parking lot. We stepped in to the entrance. The first thing you notice is the Halloween decoration of a cob web directly over your head. I'm not a super tall guy (6ft) it was about an inch over my head. We then stood there for about 10 minutes staring at an empty hostess stand. Once a person took back into a very empty restaurant. We were immediately were brought chips a  "salsa". It's more like tomato water than salsa. I ordered the combo platter with a taco, an enchilada, a tamale, rice and beans. It was a ton of food. The enchilada and tamale was drenched some kind of thick salty red sauce. The taco had no flavor. My wife ordered the chicken sopa. It had no flavor what so ever. Between waiting a long time to order to waiting a long time for tasteless food it's so not worth it. I don't think we will be back anytime soon.

This is a great little hole the wall restaurant. They are still working out some of the kinks is service (kind of slow) but the food is well worth the wait. The mango Margarita is amazing. Our first visit to this place I ordered the daily special of 3 enchaladas one beef with red sauce, one chicken with a cream sauce,1 cheese with green sauce. The chicken one is almost better than my wife's chicken enchaladas. My wife ordered shrimp in a wine sauce. The chef delayed it coming to the table because he noticed it did not have the correct sauce so he had it remade. To make up for the delay they gave her another Margarita (score).  Tonight I decided to have the whole fried fish.  This dish is a whole tilapia marinated in lemon and lime with sea salt. It was little weird eating a whole fish but worth the try. I defiantly suggest you give this small business family run restaurant a try.
