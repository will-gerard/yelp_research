The food was fine but the service was atrocious.  We went for an early dinner before a game and only a few tables were occupied.  Nonetheless, after asking for a few minutes to look over the menu, our waiter disappeared and never came back.  We flagged down another employee who got the waiter.  After we got the food, he checked on us once and disappeared.  We never saw him again.  A young woman brought the check after we flagged down yet another employee and asked.  Really, where were all the servers?    It was also disappointing to me that the bill was not clear.  On one side was 4 * $6.50 for drinks but no drink total anywhere.  On the other side was our two entrees, each with a price, and then a grand total.  I like to check the bill so I calculated it and it was right, but why not list all the items ordered, then tax, then a total?    We were late for our game.

The museum was great fun for the 11-year old I was with. He loved it.  I thought it was good, too.  It was very expensive.  What I didn't like at all was standing in line for 10 minutes to buy a ticket when there were only three people in line ahead of us.  Could it be any slower?  How about hiring enough help?  Then the girl who sold us the ticket demanded to know my name.  I asked why and she said the computer required it so that if I ever wanted to buy a membership, they would have my name.  Baloney!  I do not see why the Arizona Science Center needs my name in order for me to visit.

This is a great hospital for solving complex medical problems but security is a problem.    My friend's iPad was stolen while she was sleeping in the middle of the night.   An iPad is a reasonable thing to bring to the hospital to pass the time.  It's not like she brought a diamond ring and left it lying around.

I've eaten here twice in the last few weeks and both times were with friends from mainland China - Shanghai and Beijing.  Both of these friends proclaim the restaurant as very authentic and I agree, having visited China at least a dozen times.  The food is tasty - I've eaten boiled chicken, kung pao chicken, pork noodle soup, pork dumplings, vinegar cucumber and sauteed garlic green beans.  All delicious although I have a feeling I was eating a lot of calories.    So if you desire authentic Chinese food such as you would get in Shanghai or Beijing, try this place.  It's in the Chinese Cultural Center.

I had always heard that Jordan's is the best Mexican restaurant in town and I can see why people think so.  It's got a lot of tasty dishes on its menu.  My vegetarian dining companion did not find too many options but was able to put together a nice dinner.  Ambiance and location are good.  This restaurant obviously has a lot of happy regulars.  Would I come here again.  Yes!

You won't have to call these folks because they will call you . . . repeatedly.  This business does not observe the Do Not Call list and has been pestering people with unwanted calls for years and years.  So ask yourself this:  If a business doesn't respect the law, why would they respect you or your home and possessions?    I advise you to stay away from Adobe.  Far, far away.

Love this bistro because of the food.  It seems quite authentic, too - sort of like being in France except the service is faster than it would be in France.    My favorite item is the duck confit sandwich - it is not always on the menu.  You can also get a great glass of wine here.  I've eaten at the bar and that's a fun experience - you can talk to other customers and the bartender.  It's a friendly place with nice customers.  When I want to treat myself, I come here.

This shop sure fixed my problem fast and without any issues.  I was rear-ended and stopped by to get an estimate, which I got in about 15 minutes.  Easy and convenient.    The estimate was reasonable and they stayed within it.  In fact, it was actually better and more accurate than the insurance company shop, which I also visited for an estimate.  They promised to get the car out in 24 hours or so and they beat that - it was ready the same day.  I recommend this body shop.  The repair job was just beautiful.  And they even washed my car!

Unfortunately, I got into another collision recently and again, went to Brighton Ranch.  Again, they did a great (and timely) job and were super nice.  I was thinking about why I like this shop so much and I think it's because not only do they fix your car but also they make you feel secure - sort of like you know they will treat you right.  At a lot of auto repair places, you don't really know that.  Here, they will fight for you to make sure the insurance company buys original parts.  That happened in this case - the insurance company wanted to put in used parts and Kelly at Brighton fought for me to get an original part.  I promise I am not related to this business or any of its employees, although it sounds like it.  I just think that people who do a spectacular job of service ought to be commended.  Thank you, Brighton Ranch!

I have been going to this dry cleaner since I moved to the area 10 or so years ago and I like them.    They are not cheap, so if you want the lowest price, go elsewhere.    However, they are competent - they will do something twice if they think it will get out a stain.  They did that with a bedspread of mine recently and I didn't even realize it had a stain.

I live nearby and have been to this restaurant many times.  The food - good - always tasty and I can recommend the sweet and sour soup, tofu vegetables, pork and vegetables, beef and broccoli - never had a bad dish here.  The service - better to do take-out than dine-in.  They don't have a lot of help so you wait a long time.  This might be a family business.  I'm not sure.  But if you call in your order, they have it ready fast.

We were three rookies looking for something to do and so we filled a couple of happy hours at Scottsdale Gun Club.  It was fun and the staff there was nice to us.  I get what other reviewers say about customer service and "you're not worthy" attitude because there are a lot of very accomplished shooters at this place.  However, we didn't feel looked down upon.  We did fine.    We rented an AK47 and the staff member was very nice in showing us how it worked and how to shoot it properly.  I appreciated the treatment we received and am seriously considering going back to take a class and learn to shoot better.  It wasn't cheap but then, this is a big, modern facility with a lot of guns from which to choose.

I was so prepared to love this place because I had visited before and because it was featured on Check Please Arizona, the local PBS program.  I never had worse hummus in my life - bland, watery - like no other I have ever tasted.    The so-called naan bread was the low point of the meal - like a piece of dry cardboard.  Really awful.    My friend liked the salad.  I like the gyro strips.    In the future, we would probably go to one of the many other excellent middle-eastern places in town.    The service was fine - our waiter was a nice young man.

We visited here for lunch and were somewhat disappointed.  My friend, a real German, ordered roulade, red cabbage and mashed potato.  The roulade was fine but it wasn't really hot.  The mashed potatoes were definitely from a box - not fresh.  The red cabbage was OKish but only lukewarm.  We probably would not return - would probably try Zur Kate, which is in the same strip center.

My friend is a serious quilter and she LOVED this store.  It is large, airy and pleasant.  She thought the fabrics were modern - the recent fabric lines from Moda, etc.  She spent an hour there.    They have not only yardage but all kinds of pre-cuts from quarter bundles to jellyrolls.  They also have many patterns and examples of what they would look like when complete.  The women who work at the store were nice and very helpful.  They were happy to cut fat quarters from the yardage.    We visited at least a half a dozen quilting stores in the Valley and this was by far the best, according to my friend.

Good happy hour.  We ordered almost all the dishes on the appetizer menu and they were great.  Notably, the queso con puerco is delicious!  I also like the pork wings.  Chicken on flat bread is good, as is guacamole.    You cannot beat $5 drinks - several good spirit drinks and wine, too.  I had two mojitos and they were fine.  We sat on the patio and it was very pleasant.  The bill for two drinks and two appetizers was $28 before tip.  I recommend this happy hour.

Since I found this place, I never go elsewhere for lightbulbs.  Why?  The prices are good. The inventory is extensive - if you need a weird bulb, they'll have it. The people who work there are exceedingly nice and helpful.  Finally, and I think this is what I like best, it reminds me of what retailing was like in years gone by.  This place couldn't be more different than a big box store.  So if you want to know how things were pre-Home Depot, WalMart, etc., come here.

Last March, I hired Michael Hans of Harper's Nursery to design a refresh of my back yard. I wanted new plants with lots of color and a stucco repair and repaint job, as well as new rock and a paver walkway. I am not highly knowledgeable so relied quite a bit on Mike's experience and expertise. He came up with a creative, open plan that appealed to me and then proceeded to execute it. It took 3-4 weeks which seemed reasonable to me.  After four months and a very hot summer, all the plants are thriving and things look colorful and great. The fence was even stuccoed to match the texture on my house, although I didn't specifically ask for this. Mike knew to do it. I love having a paver walkway.  I am very pleased with Michaels Hans and would recommend him to you. I would call him again for future landscape work.  He can be reached at 480-946-3481.

For what it is, a Mexican restaurant in Gila Bend, Sofia's is greatest.  I really like it and when I drive through Gila Bend, I stop here.    I have enjoyed huevos rancheros and carne asada with eggs.  You can choose flour or corn tortillas.  The refried beans are so, so delicious that you will eat every bite.    I highly recommend this restaurant.

If you want an interesting choice of martinis in a beautiful and provocative setting, come here.  The food is very good and I've never had a bad meal;  Specifically, I recommend the Flirtini, which is a berry martini.  It's sweet, so if you don't want a sweet taste, true the classic.  It's good, too.  I also have enjoyed almost every sandwich on the menu and many appetizers - all excellent.    The ambiance is creative and interesting.  When I was there last, a giant human eye exhibit flickered above the bar.  Really, who else does this?  It's fantastic.

Whenever I am in this part of the Valley, which isn't often, I try to stop by Lee Sandwiches because they are so different and delicious.  To me, the bread is what distinguishes Lee's sandwich - they have mastered the baguette.  It's so fresh.    The sandwiches are European (ham, turkey, pork, etc.) or Vietnamese (various preparations of pork, pate, etc.) on a baguette or croissant.  They are mostly bread but the bread is so good that it's worth it.    I wish Lee's would move the signs describing the food over to the left so that you could see it while waiting in line (which you will do here).  As it is, you can only see the possibilities when you get to the order station.    I also think that when it's busy, you can wait in line for a long time and then wait to receive your order for a long time.  So don't think you will be able to rush in and rush out.

I have dined here a few times and every time the food and service has been great.  What is distinctive about Cibo is its ambiance - the lovely patio with old trees providing the shade.  It is so pleasant.  For evening happy hour, I have twice shared the platter with meat, cheese, etc. and it is quite good with a glass of wine.  The thin crust pizza is excellent, too.  I hope to try more things.  The servers are friendly and in my experience, fast.  And unlike many downtown Phoenix restaurants, parking is pretty easy.  That does make a difference.

U.S. Egg is a great place for breakfast and the protein cake is notable.  The other dishes are good, too, but the protein cake can only be gotten at this restaurant (as far as I know).  It is just delicious!  Another thing to know about U.S. Egg - there is often a line outside the door but do not let that dissuade you - it moves quickly and you won't wait long.  And of course, it's worth it!  Plenty of parking, too.

I have loved the Landmark for years and hadn't been here in awhile.  It's still great.  We had the salad bar, which is a salad room with everything under the sun available.  What I like about this restaurant is a trip to the basement where there is a fabulous collection of photos recounting Arizona's history.  This is a good place for lovers of history.

I took my friend to the Mercy Gilbert Emergency Room and I was very surprised at how callously she was treated.  She was in severe pain and was placed in a bed about 10 feet from the nurse's station.    While she lay suffering, the nurses were loudly discussing their weekend plans without any regard for her.  "I'm going out with Josh tonight!"  "I've been checking flights for my trip."    When I requested a cup of water for my friend, they told me no and instructed me to get back behind the curtain.  This went on for an hour and these nurses couldn't have cared any less.    I was further shocked when the hospital's Director of Customer Experience told me that the hospital is known for pain management.  I almost laughed out loud.  If you have the choice to go to a different ER, do it.

Nice place for lunch.  We ordered two Italian pork sandwiches and shared them; they were great - good meat on very tasty baguettes.  Each came with a nice lettuce salad.  It's a filling lunch.    I'm going to make a point to come back here soon as I really did enjoy it.

At first, I could not locate this business because it moved locations.  However, the owner graciously contacted me directly and offered to work with me.  I had already acted but had I not, I would have tried New West.

I like this restaurant because the menu is so creative and different.  On my most recent visit, I had the oyster po-boy popovers and they were delicious - light and flavorful.    Another thing I like about Tuck Shop is the availability of small plates and large plates of entree-type items.  If you don't have a big appetite, you are not constrained to a few appetizers; you can get a substantial meal in a smaller portion.  This makes so much sense and I wish more restaurants would do it.   I noticed that Tuck Shop is now selling tickets to those who want to reserve a specific dinner time.  The ticket prices is deducted from your meal.  I totally understand and endorse this practice - why should the owner be stuck with a bunch of no-shows?  However, I was surprised that over and above the ticket prices is a 30% charge for service and tax.  Tickets for two @ $20 each + $11.98 service fee + tax = $51.98.

If you love meat, you should come to Fogo de Chao.  Many different cuts and preparations of many different meats - beef, pork, lamb, chicken - are offered continuously.   Someone is always stopping by your table with something new.  The  meats also come with interesting but filling side dishes, so pace yourself so you can eat the meat, which is the main event.  I have also skipped the meat on occasion and gone just for the salad bar, which is excellent and full of good things - not typical American salad bar items.  I was happy with it.  This place is not cheap but it's highly enjoyable.

The food is simply superb - always tasty.  I often have Sag Paneer and it is really good.  The naan is great, too.  This is a very good place to go with a vegetarian because there are many, many options.  When the weather is good, it's lovely to sit on the patio.  We sat there a few weeks ago and while the service was pretty slow, the entire experience was good.  It was Saturday night and they were busy.

India Oven has a fantastic buffet.  There is a vegetarian section, a non-vegetarian section, a dessert section and a drink section.  The food is very delicious and you will likely overeat when you come here.  But you will walk away full and satisfied and thinking about when you can come back.  I particularly liked the saag.  One small piece of advice to the owners . . . don't take our plates away while there is still food on them.  This happened several times during a one-hour meal.  We really felt that you were rushing us out.  Not cool.

It's fun to come out here for a spring training game and the ball park is definitely state of the art - comfortable seats, cup holders, plenty of restrooms, lots of food options, friendly workers . . . they try hard to make it great.    The only thing that was frustrating was getting out of the parking lot after the game, which took over an hour.  I suppose that's inevitable, but it does affect one's experience.  I was wondering about riding my bike next time.    Would I go again?  You bet!

Such a pleasant place to pass the time and people watch.  When I meet someone for dinner at AZ 88, I often come 15 minutes early just to sit on a bench and watch the world go by.  I have seen many photo shoots and talked to many interesting people in passing.    I'm happy to live in a city that has this lovely park.

I like this store because it has a wide variety of choices and good prices.  I do not like this store because my interactions with people working in the store have been mixed.  On one hand, the employees seem trained to ask you if you need help, give you advice, etc.  On the other hand, people stocking shelves (maybe not employees??) are positively rude.  I have asked a question about the availability of a particular wine and been blown off, spoken to rudely, etc.  So the directive to be courteous to customers may not extend to vendors who are in the store.

I really like this place because the food is excellent.  You just cannot beat their tacos - that's what I always order.  They are great.  The location is good, too.  It's pretty easy to park for free, which is nice (and not like Phoenix, which charges a fortune - thank you, Scottsdale).    I've always gotten good service here, too - very attentive and nice servers.  I recommend that you try Taco Tuesday!

I really like this place and try to eat there when I can.  It's Mexican food that is not drenched in cheese.  They also have Mexican Coke, which is the perfect drink with the tacos or the Al Pastor.  The flavors are delicious.  I recommend it to you.  Have also eaten the one on 7th Street and it's good.

The food is plentiful and delicious at Khyber Halal.  The menu is dominated by lamb dishes.  The walls are  covered with hangings from Afghanistan and guests sit on pillows at short tables.  It is quite charming and I liked it a lot.  My only regret is that I live pretty far from Khyber Halal so cannot get here too often.

I had lunch here after a hike and was really pleased with how tasty the gyro sandwich was.  The pita bread was fluffy and seemed like it had just come out of the oven - warm and fresh.  The gyro meat was also fresh and delicious.  I was just struck at how good it was for a strip center gyro place.    Give this place a try and I think you will like it, too!

I love the idea of this place and expected to get great pork dishes but alas, it's really a Mexican restaurant.  Only one pork dish on the menu.    Food was fine.  Nothing special.  I also took home $50 worth of meat from the meat counter in the restaurant and it was fine, but again, nothing special.  I thought the sausages were pretty bland and tasteless.  I don't plan to go back, not because it was bad but because there are lots of better places.

I almost didn't come to this restaurant based on the Yelp reviews, but I did and it was good.  The menu is, indeed, very creative and the food was quite tasty.  Most importantly, the service, which I had expected to be bad based on reviews, was great.  The waiter was quite attentive.    I would definitely return to this restaurant.

Excellent!  I love the new location.  I had dinner on the patio last weekend and it could not be more pleasant.  I like it so much better than the old location on Central.  The menu is good.  I had a gyro kisra and it was great.  I don't eat a lot so I took half of it home and it was great the next day, too.  The service was good, too.  Our waiter was a very friendly young man who took great care of us.   I will go here more often because of the new location.

I had breakfast here - a chorizo quesadilla - and it was just great.  It was way too large - I could have been happy with one-third of what I was given.  I ended up leaving over half of it -- so maybe smaller portions could be offered.  The service was fine.  What I want to tell Barrio Avion, if they read these reviews, is that the signage is highly confusing and makes it hard to order.  I suggest:  1)  increase the type size on the signs (it's small and really hard to see), and 2) show some photos of the food.    I would surely go here again - no doubt.

This is my favorite breakfast place and I'm happy that there is now a location on Shea Boulevard.    On Sundays, of course, there is a line but what I have always noticed about US Egg is that the line moves.  Plus, this place is large.  Last Sunday, we waited maybe 10 minutes - well worth it.  We come here for the protein cake because it is unique and delicious.  The other breakfast items are good; I have never had a bad meal at US Egg.  Food is quite plentiful, too, and you might end up taking some home.  You get a pitcher of water at your table and if you order coffee, you get a pitcher at your table.  That's so convenient.  There are so many great breakfast places in Scottsdale and this is definitely one of them.

I've been here a few times and think I'm ready to review.    The food is just great - love the flat breads and the sea salt artichoke was spectacular.  The friend with whom I dined suggested that the chef not use so much mayonnaise in the crab salad because she said it obscured the good taste of the crab.  I love, love, loved the oysters with creamed spinach!  Major yum.  I'm giving only four stars because the service could be a bit better.  The last two times I've come here, no one has brought water, despite a request at the beginning of the meal both times.  Yesterday, the server brought the expensive tea drink we ordered but totally ignored us on water.  Something similar happened Sunday night when we came here plus at that time, our server just disappeared.  So, great food, spotty service.

It's not cheap but the food is great and really worth it.  The fish tacos are not to be missed and I really enjoyed the fish and chips, too.    The service is quite good; you order at the counter and they bring it to your table.  Last time I was there, I noticed the staff working very hard to ask customers what more they needed, clear tables and just generally keep the place clean and keep things moving.  The employees are unfailingly friendly.  This is a good place.  Try it!
