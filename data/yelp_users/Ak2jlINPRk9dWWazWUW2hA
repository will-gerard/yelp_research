The Blue Fin is my favorite Teriyaki stop in the valley.    To begin, the service here is awesome!  For such a casual restaurant, they really know how to make you feel welcome.  I absolutely love the food here too.  Great appetizers, spring rolls, inari, sunomono, etc.  Being vegetarian, I always order the same...Steamed Vegetable Bowl.  For the money, you get a TON of food here.  The teriyaki sauce is perfect, not too sweet like some of those chain places.  Did I mention that the service here is the best?  The only thing wrong with The Blue FIn; they are not opened on the weekends, Monday through Friday only.

Los Olivos is great!  I am a huge fan of any car wash that doesn't use brushes.  The people here are incredibly friendly & the do a great job.  They also offer detailing & window tinting.  I've never had a complete detail here, but they do a great job on mats.

That's A Wrap may have great wraps, but I love their bowls.  The food here is great.  They have interesting specials too.  "The Best" chips & salsa, not really, but pretty good.  Pretty much everything can be made vegetarian, which is awesome.  Brown rice is good, but not worth an extra $1.00, sorry.   The parking kind of stinks, but if you can't find parking, don't expect a seat.  Atmosphere is pretty cool, I love the artwork that changes each time I go there.  Service could use a boost of friendlyness.

Am I the only person that CONSTANTLY gets static electric shocks at Costco???  Costco is pretty much the same where ever you go in the valley.  Where are the vegetarian options??  Thats nice you can get a 20 pack of Italian sausages, but where is the multi-pack of tofu??

Ick!  Nothing like a 20 pound pizza full of oil & cheese.  You know its going to be bad when you pick it up & the box feels like its going to dissolve in your hands.

Absolutely love Audi North Scottsdale!!  The sales staff are extremely knowledgeable & friendly, especially Brian M.  Showroom is clean & well designed; not to mention stocked with sweet rides.  Don't miss the 2 gleaming, red-hot R8s!  The service department is also a great team.  Jason & Jill are the best!  Bottled water would be nice thought, you can get that at Right Honda.  Overall, a great, haggle-free experience.

COCKROACHES IN THE FOOD!!!  After my disappointing experience with Malee's at Desert Ridge several years ago I pretty much wrote the chain off.  That is, until I was with a few friends on a Sunday evening looking for a bite to eat after visiting the DBG for the Chihuly exhibit.  The four of us decided on Thai & our friend that was driving mentioned Malee's.  We all agreed to give it a try after we realized that the other mentioned options were closed on Sunday evening.  To start, Malee's atmosphere was not bad.  The dinning room was clean (or seemed so) & was well decorated for a Thai restaurant.  The service was marginal...  Our server proceeded to explain all of the specials, all of which he pretty much said were not good.  Pretty strange, but I always appreciate the honesty, but needless to say, we ordered off of their regular menu.  The food...  The food was OK, nothing special.  I absolutely LOVE great Thai food, however, this was not much better than what you would be served at a Chinese restaurant.  Presentation was great, but the food was missing the real Thai flavors & covered with tons of sodium-rich sauce & oil.  For those of you who rave about this place, try Thai Lahna or Thai Rama for excellent authentic Thai cuisine.  Back to the COCKROACHES IN THE FOOD!!!  After the four of us had our first serving of food with rice, I went in for another serving of rice from the community bowl to try my partners dish.  Amongst the rice was a "friend" looking up at me, a COCKROACH.  Although I am vegetarian, the fact that an animal was in the rice did not freak me out.  Cockroaches, however are not a sign of cleanliness in a restaurant.  I already had my concerns after visiting the restroom to wash my hands before dinner, what a freaking mess!  But that's another show...  After finding the cockroach in the rice, I brought this to the server's attention, trying not to make a scene & upset my friends who had all already eaten from the rice bowl.  I requested a fresh bowl of rice & explained the problem.  He saw it & agreed to bring a new bowl, which he did shortly thereafter.    One big problem that I have with Malee's is that we did not receive any sort of apology for being served a COCKROACH in our rice.  I was not looking for a free dinner, but an apology was in order for such a disgusting situation from both the server & a manager/owner would have been nice.  Obviously the server & or management did not care that they served us a COCKROACH in our food.  Obviously the management/owners DO NOT CARE about sanitation.  Obviously the management/owners DO NOT CARE about their customers health & well-being as long as they get their money.  Needless to say, I will never go back here again.  If you are looking for a good, authentic, sanitary Thai feast, try Thai Lahna or Thai Rama.

Can I live here too????  Taliesin is AWESOME!    What happened to architecture in America?  We went from visionaries like FLW to mass produced mega-neighborhoods where every house looks the same & with any luck will stand for no more than 50 years.  Taliesin west is a great example of embracing nature into architecture.

Love this place!  After having a few other Ethiopian feasts at other restaurants, Lalibela is the best.  The food is fresh & perfectly seasoned.  TONS of vegetarian options.  Can not complain about anything.

I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE!!!  First of all, I am not a fan of buffets.  Usually you get a selection of questionable choices & over-cooked slop.  Udupi Cafe does the traditional Indian buffet lunch perfectly.  At least on weekends & holidays.  The week-day lunch is a little disappointing, not in quality but in variety.  The weekend/holiday lunch buffet is full of variety.  Being vegetarian, its nice to have a buffet full of tasty options without worry.  The majority of dishes are vegan & clearly marked.  Everything is tasty & well seasoned.    You wont find any Tandoori options here, so no Naan.  But, the Dosa is absolutely delicious & don't hesitate to ask for more.  I have even witnessed a 4 foot long Dosa being served to a family, so bring your  friends & maybe get lucky.

LOVE IT!  Too bad its all meat.  Can't go there anymore .  :(  Brunch is awesome, not too busy.  Coffee is great too!  Or you can do a Hoegaarden or Chimay with your eggs.

Freakin awesome, for Vegas.  Rooms are top notch.  Best in town.  Room service is marginal at best.  Don't order breakfast if you have to be anywhere before noon.  Fitness center is very nice.  Spa is AWESOME.

This is the best Pita Jungle I have been to.  The service at this location is outstanding.  We have never had issue with delayed food or attitude & the servers go above and beyond.  The food at this location is consistently good & the portions are generous.  I am a huge fan of the cilantro hummus topped with pico de gallo.  The garlic potatoes are simply awesome!  If they don't come with your dish, order a side of them.  Pita Jungle has a TON of vegetarian options.  The Macro Platter is a great choice.  I think I would sell a kidney for their mixed bean recipe.

Where else can you find a can of green tea above frozen bull pizzle.  This place is pretty awesome!  If you are a vegetarian, avoid the back of the store.  Lots of living fish, smelly dead fish, & constant sawing of meat with some kind of power saw.  Lots of great looking fresh produce.  Stuff is cheap too!!  TONS of Asian sauces & seasonings.  A whole isle dedicated to tea.  Major plus between May & September - Underground parking!!

I totally agree with Sandra...  Jamie IS the best!!  The Salon recently merged with Covet down the street.  Although kinda weird being in the back of a clothing boutique, the place is nice.  It is cleaner, smaller & the lighting is much better.

This is one of the better Chipotles I have been to.  After dining at many of their location, this seems to be the healthiest one I have been to.  The rice is not too oily & the beans are not too salty.  Everything seems fresh, compared to other locations.  One big plus for me, when ordering a vegetarian burrito, I am NOT asked "what kind of meat".  As far as service goes, the people working here are very nice & they actually listen to you request.  If you want "a little" of something, they do not throw a wheelbarrow of it on your burrito.

This was my first time dinning at Pita Pit. The setup reminds me of a Subway, you order your pita sandwich or salad & then proceed to the assembly area to choose toppings. Their sandwiches are served wrapped in pita bread & they have a large selection of sandwiches to choose from. They also have a good selection of veggies, cheeses & sauces to choose from.   Vegetarian options in the Nortera Shopping Center area are few & far between. Pita Pit is not a vegetarian restaurant by any means, however they do have several veggie pita sandwiches.   The Hummus Pita tasted really good! The toppings & the pita bread seemed very fresh. While the pita could have been filled with more hummus & veggies, the size was probably sufficient. I will definitely be back to try some of the other options.
