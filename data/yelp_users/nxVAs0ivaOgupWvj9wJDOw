When my car started making scary, loud, noises, I panicked and took it to the nearest reputable mechanic (Virginia Auto).  I had heard they were a bit more expensive than other places, but my brother had just had a really great customer service experience there, so I decided to chance it.  After explaining to the very nice mechanic working the front desk that I really did not have any money to spare, I left my car in their hands and crossed my fingers.  A few hours later, I had a written estimate in hand:  $1,600+.  I was hugely disappointed (who happens to have a spare $1,600 lying around?) so I forwarded the quote to some knowledgeable friends who told me that I should definitely get a second opinion.  Once all was said and done, I managed to work out a solution to my auto troubles for $700 from a different mechanic.   Yes, Virginia Auto does good work.  Yes, they offer GREAT customer service.  NO, it's NOT worth paying DOUBLE for.     P.S. Do yourself a favor and check out Inman & Sons instead. :)

$5 martinis and $5 manicures on Mondays!!!  The manicurist teaches at a school, so - needless to say - the manicure was great.  The drinks were good.  The bartender stayed on top of us, but also out of our way.    The atmosphere is just lovely - chill/quiet - and the staff (including the perfectly charming (and handsome!) Owner) were really pleasant to be around.  I think Cheuvront may be losing some of its steam to the newer restaurants downtown and, granted, I've yet to try this out for dinner and wine, but it's really a very lovely place and I'd really like to see this neighborhood staple thrive!

A couple of years ago, I made the mistake of trying to go blond via an at-home dye job.  The first attempt resulted in pinkish hair and utter horror.  A second try got my hair to blond(ish) and so I resigned myself to that. Then I had to go get a haircut.    I saw my stylist, Kelsey, at Salon Estique and she immediately noticed the change.  She ever-so-subtly and kindly made me realize that at-home-blond just doesn't work and then worked out a plan with me to highlight my hair into submission while staying in my meager price range (who wants to spend boatloads of money on hair?!).  So, I paid the extra $30 (compared to the price of coloring at home) and I couldn't be happier!  Kelsey's proven to me time and again that I can really trust her to get my color JUST RIGHT and it always grows out gracefully, too.  The prices are comparable to any other upper end salon I've seen and the experience is worth every penny.  I wouldn't trust anyone else with my color.

A good pair of jeans can be a lifelong ally.  But the gaping hole in the seat of that favorite pair from 10th grade just wasn't gonna fly.   Lucky for me, this place exists!  They REALLY patched those suckers, and didn't leave a hint that there had ever been a hole.  Guaranteed to survive however many cartwheels or squats or pocket yanks these jeans have coming to them over the next ten years.  I'd definitely come back.

Yelp delivers again!!!  We recently added a new attorney to our law firm and thus needed new business cards and announcements.  Our old standby - Ponte - was bought out by some out-of-state entity.  Wanting to keep our dollars local, we decided to give Impact a try.  They couldn't have been nicer!  They were so knowledgeable and helpful and responded to e-mails almost immediately!  Plus, they gently suggested changes to our in-office design to make our announcements really stand out.  You really can't beat this place for customer service.  They've got us for life.

I went here on the strength of a friend's recommendation and, boy, am I glad I did!  I walked in and announced, "I have a 13 year old Toyota with 150,000 miles on it and, given all that, I hear that it might need new hoses and belts."  Many mechanics would take one look at me, take one look at my car, and see money signs.  Not at Inman's!  They did a FREE inspection and then had a frank discussion with me about when to get the belt and hose maintenance work done.  And the price they quoted was several hundred dollars cheaper than the price quoted by the one other mechanic that I talked with (by telephone).  Inman's certainly earned my respect today and they will earn my dollars in the future.

UPDATE:  Sooooo... the timing belt that Inman & Sons told me I should probably replace whenever I had the spare money finally gave out.  All I knew was that my car was making scary loud noises, so I drove it to the closest reputable mechanic to my work (Virginia Auto).  After explaining to the very nice person at Virginia Auto that I have been working three jobs to save up for some international travel and had NO spare cash, I left my car in their hands and crossed my fingers.  They called hours later and delivered the blow:  a $1,600 repair.  It occurred to me then to run the quote past my old pals at Inman & Sons, so I gave Jeff a call, sent him the estimate, and we were able to work out a solution for less than $700.  No joke.  Going to Inman & Sons saved me $700 (I still had to pay a $200 diagnostic fee to Virginia).  I literally hugged Jeff when I picked up my car.  The rest of the story:  They had the repair done in hours, offered me rides both ways, and took the time to walk me through exactly which parts needed to be replaced and why.  They even showed me the parts they took off the car.  Seriously, these people are heaven-sent.  So lucky to have found them.

I'm so sad I didn't discover this place years ago!!!  Lululemon, Prana, and Lucy oh my!  Patagonia, North Face, and REI!!  This place seems to market itself as a children's consignment shop, but they have a whole wall dedicated to high end active adult's clothing!    I only had 30 minutes to spare on my first visit, but I walked out with two premium tops and two pairs of premium pants (Lululemon, Prana, Lucy and Patagonia) for less than you'd shell out for a single new Lululemon top.    Saving money, saving the environment, and still being able to enjoy the highest quality active brands?  What's not to love?!

Love me some Y action!  The downtown Y has everything you could ever possibly want in a gym: tons of cardio machines, a separate weight room, a pool, the "trendy" fitness equipment (like TRX and heavy ropes), personal trainers, lots of classes, cold/hot filtered water, even a cafe.  They could use a couple more stair-masters though.  ;)  Bonus:  The staff here are super cute. Especially Vince. ;)

This is one of those hidden gems that you'll want to take out-of-town guests to. It's located just off of the I-10, next to a tire shop, but when you step inside, you're transported to your favorite restaurant in Rocky Point. They have an extensive menu of REALLY good food and they'll let you order off the breakfast menu all day.   :)  This is my new favorite Mexican food restaurant!

Dr. Tymczyna is probably the best doctor I've ever been to.  She really takes the time to LISTEN and empathize at every appointment.  Everyone else in the office is friendly and knowledgeable as well.  Highly recommended.

Cheap drinks, pool, juke box. It's your typical neighborhood dive bar.  EXCEPT Wednesdays and Thursdays, they have free, no-holds-barred stand up  comedy in the lounge!  I'm not gonna lie - it can be a little hit or miss and I've had some more "politically correct" friends get offended, but I say grab a few drinks, leave your sense of decency at the door and prepare yourself for some gut-busting, tears streaming down your face, falling out of your chair (okay, that last part might be attributed to those aforementioned cheap drinks) laughter.   So much fun.

There's a portion of the population that will find some of the amenities at this pet hospital over the top, and I used to be a part of that population, but when my Riley was really sick, this place just DELIVERED on the comfort factor.  I swear he didn't realize we were at a pet hospital until they started poking things up his butt.  The waiting room is large, CLEAN, supplies free treats and... has a flat screen tv playing movies for your pup.  No joke.  Seating consists of low benches that are easy for a small dog to get up on so your little pal can lay with you while he's feeling ill.  There are signs offering acupuncture and naturopathic remedies for your animals.  See?  That's the over-the-top factor.  But honestly, this is the best vet I've ever been to.  The staff are all super friendly and seem to just have a way with pets. They took me on a walk-in basis after my vet recommended that Riley see someone THAT day (he had an intestinal blockage).  They worked with me to find the most cost-effective way to treat my Riley and didn't push any unnecessary treatments.   I hate to do this to my old vet, but I have to make the switch.  This place is just so great.  Plus they're open 'til 10 p.m.!!!

Air conditioning was not functioning at a summer event called WINTERFEST.  Seriously?  It may be an okay place to go to see an event, but I wouldn't risk planning an event there.  Big time disaster.

There isn't a better place to take a date in Phoenix.  The owners are always present and welcome guests as old friends.  The patio is absolutely gorgeous and has live music on the weekends.  The inside is a bit cramped, but is bursting with ambiance - low lights, gorgeous wood bar, local art.  And the food... Skip the wait at Pizzeria Bianco and come here instead.  Trust me on this one.  The pizza is delicious and you haven't lived until you've tried the Burrata.  Five stars.

Can I just start by saying how much love I have for our local coffee shops?  You just can't beat the personal attention and genuine care these places give.  You all know I love me some Giant on my Monday mornings (close to work! great vibe! good music!  STELLAR coffee!) and I gotta get down on Jobot on my way in to my second job.  Songbird's been frickin' killin' it with a PERFECT, CONSISTENT spicy chai (make it dirty) and then there's my home coffee shop: Copper Star.    Ooooooooooh, Copper Star, how do I love thee?  Let me count the ways. Their drinks are great.  They showcase local art.  The music is good.  Their baristas are genuinely nice people.  Seriously.  I might hug one of them next time I go in.  But it's the FOOD that prompted this post.  Today I discovered their vegan, gluten-free, peanut-butter oatmeal cookies.  I know there are people out there that imagine that vegan and gluten free can't possibly be good, but I honest-to-god believe that the 3 (maybe 3? Maybe 20?) minutes I spent enjoying that cookie may have been some of the best minutes of my life.  I can't really pin down how long it was, because I'm pretty sure that cookie helped me transcend space and time.  SO. Good.  I went back later for the vegan rosemary green chile potato soup.  O.M.G.   Copper Star.   CenPho.  Happy happy happiness.  P.S.  The patio's great too!

Remember that book Corduroy where little Corduroy got to explore the WHOLE department store all by himself at night, in search of his button?  That's what I want to do here.  Except, instead of searching for my button, I'd be searching for happiness.  And I'm pretty sure I'd find it.    Changing Hands is my new happy place.  It has a huge selection of new and used books, lots of sale tables, yummy smell-goods, paper goodies, even a small table of kitchen goodies.  I left with three books and an owl-shaped bag clip that hoots when you open it!  It HOOTS!  Ah!  Love, love, love this place.  Definitely check it out for unique gifts, books, or if you just need a smile.

I try to support local coffee shops in general (grow your local economy, folks!), but Starbucks' vanilla rooibos, when served over ice, just cannot be beat.  So I frequent Starbucks too!  Not. This. One.  For some reason, this location just cannot handle serving this brewed tea iced.  It is literally the only location that I've ever been to that flat out refuses to do it (on three separate occasions, by three separate baristas).  I give up!

Dr. Rudgear seemed pleasant enough in the five minutes that I got to speak with her.    The rest of my appointments were routed through her assistant who has the worst "bedside" (chairside?) manner that I've ever experienced.  In our first meeting, she launched into a lecture about the thyroid, before realizing I was there for a blood sugar issue.  Once she saw my blood sugar levels, she told me that she thought my bloodwork had to be a lab error (despite the fact that it was run twice and later confirmed by her office).  When I tried to describe my symptoms to her, she dismissed them entirely and told me "low blood sugar wouldn't cause that." Most importantly, because she chose to dismiss everything I (and my charts!) had to say, she failed to run a simple test that now - months later - confirms an adrenal issue! I felt entirely disempowered by my entire experience with this place and am disappointed to know that I've spent months feeling unwell when I didn't need to.

I had a really great car shopping experience with Right Honda!  Jay Powers helped me to figure out exactly what car would fit my needs and there was no point that I ever felt any amount of sales pressure.  The whole team worked with me to make sure my perfect car would fit into my perfect budget.  I'm THRILLED with my new wheels!

Reliably delicious Thai in Central Phoenix.  The trick is to get your food to go, grab a tea from Starbucks next door and enjoy Starbucks' awesome patio (comfy seats and mature trees and city views, oh my!).

The woman knows what she's doing.  That's all there is to it. D'Lisa "treated me" to the fastest and most painless waxing I've ever had done and yet it was still the most thorough! I don't really believe there's any way to make a Brazilian pleasant, but this place comes pretty darn close! Five stars.

Suffer through their god awful website/scheduling system.  It's worth it.  I've taken a few dance classes here (from pole dancing to hooping to yoga booty ballet) and they have all been a blast.  Their instructors just have a light about them.  There's a huge focus on self-love and fun and I swear you come out of these classes just sparkling.  If it weren't for the sweat, I'd hardly even dare to qualify it as a workout (workouts are not supposed to be THIS MUCH fun)!

If by some strange happenstance, I were to try veggie tacos that were somehow better than Gallo Blanco's, my head might explode.  I could write love poems to Gallo Blanco's veggie tacos.  So sooo good.  And cheap!  I won't rhapsodize about the guac and elote, but they are also delicious. And the drink menu is good enough that this place could stand alone as a bar.  The best part about this place, though, is the variety of ways to enjoy it:  You can get tacos and drinks while lounging in the super-comfy pool area, or stake out a spot near the bar on Flamenco Wednesdays, or grab a spot on the patio on cool fall evenings.  Or you could go the traditional route and get a table in the restaurant's lovely and modern and chic interior.    I can't say enough good things about this place.  5 stars.

*UPDATE* This was originally a four star review (I deducted a star only because you have to pay an extra $0.50 to sub rice/soy milk in your latte!), but I had to change it.  I love Giant so very , very much.  The coffee is truly fantastic, the baristas are just great, and the ambiance is so perfect that I make a point of leaving my house half an hour early every Monday morning so that I can start my workweek out right - at Giant!  Original review (after having visited only once):  I can't not mention the iced honey latte, but a quick scroll through these reviews says everything that I need to say about it.  In a word:  Yum!  The place is beautiful, the staff is nice, and I love the open air design and shared space concept.    Plus, they play good music and they play it loud.  :)

The happiest happy hour in Phoenix.  They have a HUGE selection of DELICIOUS (and veg-friendly) happy hour food and great wine specials.  I think I got 2 apps and a glass of wine for under $10 one time.  Seriously.  Seriously.    Plus the patio is gorgeous!  I actually just convinced myself that I need to go here after work today.  I would give it more stars if I could. :)

The plating was nice.   I'll give them that.  Apart from that: The food was meh.  The wait was wayyyy too long.  And I paid $2 for, seriously, a tablespoon of guac.  And it wasn't even good guac!!!  Do yourself a favor and just go to Fili-Bs.

It's patio weather and Carmel's has a fantastic patio!  Fact.  They use Maya tea, from Tucson, in their chai.  Best tea out there. Fact.  The owner is super friendly and on-site daily. Love that!   I didn't eat today, but the food looked amazing and there were lots of people there eating it, so I'm guessing it's pretty great.  I'll definitely be adding this place to my coffee shop rotation. :)

I want to re-review this place every time I try something new here!  I think the chai tsoynami changed my life last week.  But maybe I'm only saying that because I am lost in a post chocolate peanutbutter cupcake high. So rich.  So moist. Dare I say it?  BETTER than any non-vegan cupcake I've ever had.  Utter decadance.

Until last night, I had no idea nachos could be gourmet.  SO good!  I went with a friend and we split the veggie nachos and I still had enough to bring home for dinner the next day  (seriously - it is a LOT of nachos).  The food was really fantastic - tender spinach, whole cloves of garlic, tasty cheese and salsas spicy enough to make this Midwestern gal cough (in a good way).  Sadly, they were out of guac.  If this review were based solely on the quality of the grub, it'd be 5 stars.  Ambiance was close to nil, though - the interior was just a big, empty space, with nice art on the walls but nowhere to sit.   And seriously, no guac?  SO SAD.  The place has a few kinks to work out, but I assume that the amazing food will keep people coming back for seconds and thirds and....  I definitely recommend it.

This is the kind of bookstore you picture stumbling upon when you're on vacation in one of those little artsy places like Bisbee or the Haight. It's the kind of bookstore that you imagine finding an out-of-print book that's been waiting for you for your whole life.  And they have gifts! I went into Lawn Gnome to drop off some yoga flyers, lingered for the old book smell and walked out 8 dollars lighter with a Spiderman backpack for my nephew and a handmade bow for my niece.

1,000x multiplier for the ambiance (quaint bookstore meets hipster art space).    The staff were the most welcoming that I think I've met at a downtown coffee shop.  They made my 2-year old niece's steamer JUST RIGHT and then asked me if they could make it better.  The parking lot is a HUGE plus downtown and my skim vanilla latte was delicious. I'll have to add this one to my coffee rotation for sure!

I'm not sure if it was all the giggling or all of the wiggling, but I do know for sure that my abs were begging me for mercy after taking one of Ava's all level belly dance classes.  Ava is an excellent instructor who really takes time to make sure each student "gets it," but more importantly, she makes sure everyone has FUN.  I can't say enough good things about this place.  Go.  Dance.  Laugh.  Invite some more joy into your life.

I feel like going to the dentist isn't supposed to be this pleasant.  Not only is the whole staff super friendly, but I couldn't believe how knowledgeable they all were!  Miriam, the dental assistant, is going to be a fantastic dentist some day.  The extent of her knowledge was really astounding to me and her "bedside manner" (chairside manner?) really made my overall experience as pleasant as a root canal could possibly be.  She even called that night to make sure I was feeling okay! :)  Rachel, the dental hygienist,  gave me an excellent, thorough cleaning and Dr. Zia is clearly knowledgeable and very talented.  I didn't even need to use the painkillers he prescribed for me.  What a pleasant surprise.  I highly, highly, highly recommend this place!

The drinks!  The drinks!  This place just surpassed Sidebar as my go-to place for fancy-pants cocktails.  The absinthe fizz (gin, absinthe, lime, honey, soda and a HUGE strip of cucumber) might just be the best cocktail I've ever tried. Anywhere. Sadly, it's not included on the happy hour menu.  Get it anyway.  Happy hour features select $6 cocktails (the summer smash was, well, a smash) and half-price flatbreads.  My friends noted, however, that the happy hour flatbreads were considerably smaller than the $12 standard we got later that night!  Ask for Zack - he's young, he's cute, and, I can't believe I'm putting "best" into one review twice, but he honestly gave the BEST service I've ever received at a restaurant - hustling to get us several rounds before happy hour closed (He even went the extra mile by rounding up an ice bucket so that the last-ditch happy hour beer ($3)  - ordered while a half-full beer sat in front of us - wouldn't get warm!).  What a very happy happy hour, indeed.

I almost don't want to post this review because I feel like Lustre is my little secret, but I'm a nice gal, so I'll do the Yelp community a favor and share it:  You may not know it yet, but your soul has been searching for an amazing pool-side, rooftop bar with breathtaking views of downtown and the mountains to the South.  You just found it.  What more could you ask for?  An excellent happy hour you say?  Well, check that one off your list too!  I think I might become a fixture at this place.  Come for the free yoga on Wednesdays; stay for the free happiness.

Froyo is froyo is froyo, right?  Not at this place!!!  Someone lovingly crafted the perfect midcentury modern cafe/coffee shop for this Central Phoenix neighborhood (think Lux, Pane Bianco, Postino, Windsor), and then decided to go avant garde and offer Frozen Yogurt instead of that cafe fare/coffee and pastries that you would expect for such a beautifully crafted space.  I actually wanted to hang out here.  I don't think I've ever said that about a froyo shop.  The frozen yogurt itself was what you'd expect from any pay-by-the-ounce froyo shop, but Twirl gets some extra points for inventiveness in toppings - in addition to the standards, Twirl offers gourmet toppings like pumpkin pie spice, raspberry sauce, glazed pecans, and huge chunks of candy.  Perfect perfect perfect.

Twirl was already my favorite froyo place in Phoenix (as evidenced by my prior Yelp review), but they took it up a notch tonight.  Sam the man went above and beyond to make sure I satisfied my sweet tooth late on a Sunday night.  Always good vibes at this place.  Love it love it love it.

There are several yoga studios in Central Phoenix that hold a special place in my heart.  Danielle at Sutra is great.  All of the teachers at Urban are wonderful... but I think MIC might be my new fave!  I was lucky enough to take a free yoga class from Anton Mackey at the Palomar over the summer, so when I saw that he'd be a regular at MIC, I knew I'd have to try them out.  I took his class last Saturday and just WOW!  I honestly think my practice was the deepest it's ever been under his guidance.  He gives lots of adjustments and just always has such great energy and a great message to go along with each of his classes.  I can't recommend him enough!  The MIC itself is really neat, too!  I've never been in a studio that has so much hustle and bustle to it.  The space is beautiful and the staff are all super friendly.  Five stars!

I'm not huge on malls.  At all.  But the ladies and I visited Union for ladies' night specials last week and it was actually really fun!  It's more of a farmer's market for boutiques than it is a mall.  And the restaurant there - Del Piero - was exactly up my alley.  Tons of fresh, delicious salads, a nice patio, live music.  It's definitely worth a visit.  And if they keep the $20 bottle/board special at Del Piero, it's probably worth a regular visit.  ;)

After meandering from Lawn Gnome to Jobot to La Bodega - in August - *I* was melting.  I saw this place out of the corner of my eye and decided to poke inside (even though I don't eat ice cream!).  I was delighted to find a variety of delicious sorbets.  Two words:  Cucumber sorbet.  Maybe the most refreshing thing I've ever eaten.  Plus, the owners are super nice!  Adorable, local, and delicious.  What more could you ask for?
