My boyfriend was in the mood for prime rib today so I did a goggle search for places in our area. One of the listings that came up was Bobby Q. Based on the name and description as a BBQ restaurant, we were a bit unsure, but decided to trust the fantastic reviews.  The service- Our server Amberlee (please forgive if misspelled) was pleasant, knowledgable about the menu items, and sooo attentive. Our iced teas never got lower than half full and she was always near if we needed anything. One of the managers even came to the table after we got our meal to ask how everything was. On a scale of 1-10 for service, I'd definitely give a 10.   The food- In one word, WONDERFUL. Amberlee brought out corn muffins right after she took our order, which were not only moist but super tasty. When our prime rib arrived, mine was the 10oz end cut and his was the 14oz medium rare, we were astonished by the portions which were MASSIVE. The meal came with two choices of sides- mine were the loaded(bacon, cheese, sour cream, butter and chives) and roasted corn(corn on the cob roasted on the grill, then the kernels are shaved off and saut√©ed in butter) while my boyfriend had the mashed potatoes with the white gravy on the side as well as the roasted corn. Everything was perfect- the prime rib was seasoned just right with creamy horseradish and au jus and the sides complimented the meat perfectly.  Once the plates had been cleared, Amberlee returned with a bag of complimentary doughnuts to go. We were so stuffed, but truly appreciated the gesture. The check was approximately $55 for both meals and two iced teas which wasn't bad for what we got. Not only great food, but fantastic service. We are planning on returning and telling all our friends how wonderful Bobby Q is!

Sooooo.... Just left this restaurant with my friend. We were in the area and saw the high reviews on Yelp. The decor was nice, bit that's the only nice thing that I can say. The purpose of sushi is for it to taste fresh and to be made to order. However when there are numerous plates revolving around, becoming room temp, it does not make for a good dining experience. We tried the lobster roll and I've never seen lobster that looked like tuna and tasted like one would imagine how cat food would taste. So, we decided to order off the menu in the hopes that it would be fresher since it was just made. WRONG!!! The tuna roll was warm and the Philly roll smelled "fishy". We literally left everything untouched.  This was the worst dining experience I have had since being in Arizona for three years. I def would advise any and everyone to stay away from this place unless you are looking for a fast food version of sushi.

I purchased a carpet cleaning from Groupon as a gift for my mother from Sir Carpet. My mother scheduled the appointment, moved all of her furniture and was ready for clean carpets. I received a call from my mom and she said that the job couldn't be done. She explained that the two techs from Sir Carpet called her and asked if they could come out early for the appointment, which was totally fine. When they arrived at her apartment complex, one of the techs came to the door and asked my mom if she had a hose. Of course, my mother replied no. The tech then asked if she knew if the apartment complex had any hoses. Puzzled, my mom said she had no idea. The tech said ok, he would be back and went to his truck. About 5 minutes later, my mom received a call from the techs. They had left and couldn't do the job. Just like that. Wow... How unprofessional! Neither of us received a call from their management explaining why the job couldn't be done. Luckily, Groupon stepped up and refunded the cost. I will NEVER use this company.

My boyfriend and I just came from Select Appliance and words can't convey how pleased we were! We've been looking for LG appliances for our new house and came across an ad for this store. Although we live in Glendale, we decided to made the drive to Mesa to check out their inventory. As soon as we entered the warehouse, we noticed the large supply of LG washers/dryers, fridges, ovens and almost any other major appliance you could think of. We were soon greeted by Eric, who introduced himself and let us know he was there if we needed him, but didn't hover around us as we browsed. As advertised, the appliances have some dings and dents but that wasn't an issue for us. Plus, the majority of the damages were really minor considering the huge reduction in price and there's a one year warranty. We purchased a washer/dryer set for $1800 when retail was easily $1100 EACH and my kitchen will have a brand new French door LG fridge that I feel we got a smoking deal on for $1600 when retail was $2999! Plus, Eric was extremely nice and even gave us a break on the delivery charge. We are definitely pleased with our experience and plan on spending the word about Select Appliance!

I ordered service from LivingSocial to clean my apartment for a move out. I work 10 hour shifts and thought that the $90 for the service was a "deal". I was soooo wrong!! I asked my mom to be at the empty apartment 15 mins before the schedule time and the cleaners NEVER showed. After an hour of having my mother waiting, I called the owner and he said that he didn't know what happened, but someone would be on their way shortly. Long story short, after waiting 3 hours, my mom left. I called the owner and he said that his cleaning crew got backed up on a previous job(is this my fault) and weren't able to make my appointment time. He then offered to reschedule, but when I called him back to set up a time all of my calls went to voicemail. This was almost two weeks ago and I haven't heard anything back yet. I've contacted LivingSocial for a refund and requested that this company be removed from the coupon deals.

Decided to come by right when it opened and was surprised that nearly all of the tables were filled! We were seated in Renee's section and were quickly greeted with a warm smile. After taking our drink order, Renee asked if we were in the mood for a starter. We inquired about the stuffed mushrooms and she said they were a great choice. Once they arrived, my boyfriend and I throughly agreed. Since she had done such a great job with the app, we asked her advice on lunch. She knocked that one out of the park as well! Thank you Renee for making our visit awesome.
