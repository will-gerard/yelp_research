I am updating my review from a 1 to a 5. I've been going to this location for years and always received great service. I recently ran into an issue with a bill and the assistant manger, Maria personally called me. I will continue going here.

I went to use the post office today and they close at 5 o'clock. I made it in with five minutes to spare and they told me they close at 4:45 and kicked me out. I have used their post office on the weekend and always received the worst service and always met with unfriendly employees. This was the straw that broke the camels back, never again.

Ah! Love this place! Been going here for over 10 years. I'm obsessed with the chicken enchiladas. That sauce! Can't wait for my next visit.

Oh so so so good! I had the Mexican chocolate latte - amazing! I recommend getting it hot. My friend got it iced and wasn't as delicious.   Also had the brunch burger. I'm so getting this again!

Worst experience ever. I have been here before and he food was great but the service was horrible. Today we had 3 older women with us and 2 young adults. 18. You have to be 21 ad over to be here. Fine, we were gladly leaving. However hy wanted into leave right away and we had ordered 3 drinks. We drank 2 and the last one was served after they kicked us out. They had the nerve to charge for all 3. Again, HORRIBLE service.

Wow. Never ever again. They told me I needed 4 new tires, power steering flush, and rear brakes replaced. I had a free oil change so I had a feeling they would tell me I needed to get work done, but this much? I got a second opinion and my car is in tip top shape! For example, my tires will last me another 15k miles! They probably just wanted to sell them cheaper. Was told they could sell them for at least 30 bucks a tire and wanted to charge me $650+ for new ones. No thanks!

First time here and let me tell you, I was pleasantly surprised. The food was amazing. We had the buffalo chicken sandwich with a side of bacon mashed potatoes and the kale quinoa salad with chicken. Both amazing! I'll be back for ur chicken sandwich for sure. Taylor was our server and was a delight! Reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the bottomless mimosas. Don't waste your money. The first one is delicious and the rest taste like pure orange juice. Supposedly they do half orange juice half champagne (we just watched the bartender make a carafe and it was 25% champagne) Oh, and it's only until 2pm. That's not a mimosa in my book.

Yummy yummy in my tummy! Had the breakfast burrito and it blew my mind. Best burrito I've had in a long time. Fried chicken and waffles was good too. I may skip this next time but def will be getting something with waffles!!!

I've been here twice now and the first time was great service and the Mac & cheese was delicious!!! However, today was ridic. I called at 5:54 to see if they had hh and I was told "yes! Until 7". We arrived 10 min later and then I was told "no we don't have hh today". This is why I'm giving this place 2 stars.
