My fiance and I paid $34 yesterday for a Monterey Chicken Burger, a Beef Dip au jus, a Melon Margarita, and a Strawberry Lemonade. The food was not good, the service was not good, and I will not return to this location.   The chicken burger was too big to fit into my mouth, and I'm not a small person. I had to tear it apart to eat it (very messy), and was really disappointed because it was really a HUGE portion: a whole chicken breast, half an avocado, 5 slices of thick bacon, huge gobs of swiss cheese. It would have been so much better as an "edible" sandwich. My fiancee's beef smelled/tasted old - like lunch meat. The Melon margarita was overpoured with Tequila. The strawberry lemonade was actually very delicious.   In regards to service, we were seated promptly, but our waitress was incredibly terse and impatient with us. When she stopped to check in on us, she leaned over to us and walked away before we could respond. We saw other tables receive bread as they were seated and we sat and waited for our food for over a 25 minutes without ever being offered any bread. The service was what I would consider "minimal".   I love Mimi's Cafe normally, but I don't like this location - go to the one by Chandler Fashion Center.

Been to this Denny's twice. The first time was a Sunday Morning, around 10:30am, and naturally they were very busy. We ordered and waited and waited and waited and eventually our food arrived. It was pretty standard fare, nothing spectacular. The overly long wait  and poor service (our waitress forgot us). Management was really understanding and comped our meal, which made me come back a second time. The second time was today. We arrived to an empty restaurant. We were seated and given menus. We ordered. And we waited. It was empty today, so I think a 25 minute wait for a chicken sandwich is unacceptable. The sandwich itself, was not what was represented on the menu. I wasn't in the mood to complain, so I ate it, paid, and left. Will I come back again? Nah. I'm gonna hit up IHOP on Apache/Forest.

I got my lip pierced from HTC in September 2010. They were super professional, friendly, clean, and fun. They explained everything thoroughly and made sure I understood the risks of infection and how to avoid it. My lip was swollen and in pain for two weeks but it was totally awesome and worth it. I will come back here again to get pierced.

It's pretty much like a Chipotle restaurant, but these guys have a lot more options, including Mexican Gumbo and Tortilla Soup (great if you're feeling a little under the weather). I've been here twice now, and recently enjoyed the taco salads. The ingredients are very fresh and I love the taco shell bowl for the taco salad. The lettuce isn't as crisp as Chipotle's, but it is the greener part of the romaine lettuce. This doesn't translate well with hot foods, but with the cold salads, it's awesome.   As far as price goes, 2 people can eat here for about $18 including beverages.
