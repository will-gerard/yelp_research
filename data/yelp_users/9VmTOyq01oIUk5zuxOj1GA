I was not impressed with the sauce. And the beef seemed real greasy. Im use to sliced beef instead of shredded. Corn bread fell apart into a million crumbs when I took it out of the wrapper. I just wasnt impressed at all. The people were friendly and was a clean facility.

Went here for a Team building at work. The staff was friendly. Just got sick from the fumes. I heard they are moving to scottsdale and might be getting electric cars. The place had video games and pool tables. Seem like a cool place to hangout.

This is my second favorite pizza place I have ever had. I went here for lunch and said what the he** lets try it it had good reviews on YELP. I got the 2 slice lunch combo. The pizza is thinner and crispy. Not soggy thin crust. Good cheese and toppings. The server was great and the place is really nice inside. Kinda small but great decor.

Good location. Has both expensive and low cost food. Something for everyone. Bed is comfortable. They just need new tvs!! Tube tv is so 90's. Hotel is always clean and rarely do I smell smoke in the casino. Resort fees are  a joke especially since the tubes are outrageous to rent for the lazy river. They should be included complimentary.

Great friendly staff. Pizza isnt bad. But blows other pizza places out of the water to have a birthday party!! Alot more games geared to younger kids. My kids love this place compared to Peter Piper. Prizes are horrible still like everywhere else. Kind of weird that you cannot tip the servers. I slipped mine a cash tip anyways because she did such a great job for the birthday party.

I moved down here from Prescott looking for a house to rent. Found this place by word of mouth and they were great. I was in a different city and went out of their way to help me out. They took my deposit to the management company and when we were looking for a house they drove around all day and never complained. I was picky and they never seemed frustrated!! Thank you!!

You are just so close to the players and one of Diamond back players threw me a ball. Awesome experience for family! All the staff and security were nice and had about 20 people tell me to have a great day. Just all around great time.

I have flown with allegiant on 3 different trips and they have been great. Yes they charge for everything extra but offer cheap flights. I was surprised by the reviews but people just don't seem to read everything when they book their trips. It clearly states all the rules and procedures but who in today's society I guess actually reads everything. Someone compared to to the greyhound of the sky and I would have to disagree.

What a great place to takes the kids and very Cheap. They serve shaved ice.The staff is very friendly and have many flavors to choose from. It is cash only. They also offer authentic hawaiian treats. Nice and clean. Its is locally ran and owned. Also noticed on their Facebook page they did some charity work too. 7 people and the bill was like 15$. Never realized the difference between shaved ice and snow cones until now. Shaved ice is better for sure. I love the texture of it!

My work had a team build event here and it was great. Donovan was a great host.  I didn't experience the issues other people had here with waiting as it was during the week.  I think having to wait it just going to happen since there is only one of these locations in the metro area.  I live an hour away and would take my kids here over Dave and busters at least during the week.  They need to build one in the north Valley like happy Valley and I-17. It would do great considering all the family communities around it. The waiting is just going to happen based on the demand of a great facilities and service. Only way to fix it is build more.  I would even have my kids birthday parties here if they were closer.
