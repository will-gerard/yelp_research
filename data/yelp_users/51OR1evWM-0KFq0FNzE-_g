I love when I find new nail places that I can become obsessed with. The inside decor is amazing. It feels girly, clean, open, and spacious. I got a pedicure $25 and gel manicure $32 in under an hour, both ladies did not ever make me feel rushed and for the price did a really nice job. They were attentive at all times. I wasn't sitting around waiting for them like I feel I spend a lot of time doing at other places. I will be a loyal customer and be back every 2 weeks.

These guys are efficient and helpful. As a girl, sometimes I feel these auto shops tend to take advantage of you, and suggest work to your car that may not be necessary. The gentlemen here were extremely knowledgable and honest. They explain things clearly and are not trying to scam you for money. I feel very comfortable bringing my car here and will continue to do so. I suggest coming here if you are in the Tempe area and they also offer a slight student discount which is great. Doesn't hurt that there is a Dutch Bro's to grab a tea or coffee at right next door while you wait!

Regretting how long I have passed by here and never came. The corn bread they give to start is so warm and crispy. The queso and green chili pork are great appetizers. I got the half chicken with green beans and corn and it was so fresh and flavorful. We got the street corn and green chili mac n cheese as our sides, both essential. The chocolate torte for dessert was terrible, but everything else was outstanding. Great service, great atmosphere. Yummy southwestern food with tons of flavor and richness.

Really good wood fired pizza. The Scottsdale location is in the heart of old town so it was the perfect place to grab some pizza after a spring training game. We got half meatball and ricotta and the other half pepperoni and sausage. We started with the Cesar salad as well. Overall,  I have to say the meatball ricotta slice was my favorite. So creamy and so crispy. Only complaint is they don't have hot sauce or ranch but that's just apart of the experience. We sat at the bar and had attentive service the entire time. Definitely will continue to come here for delicious pizza.

Really good sushi for a great price. The happy hour prices are cheap for the great quality of sushi you will get. The service was attentive, friendly, and very helpful. They have a bar and multiple TVs and were showing the game as well. We got the Red Dragon roll, Caterpillar, Diamondback, and a basic California roll and they were all great. As a college student, this is a convenient and delicious place to grab sushi by campus. I will definitely go back.

Hate to be negative, but Oregano's used to be one of my favorite places to grab some pasta and go to when my family came to town. Well, I don't know what happened, but the quality of food is not the same at all anymore and I don't see myself returning back.   We sat down and ordered cheesy garlic bread to start. That took forever to come out. When our server brought it out, we ordered a family style salad to start, and two big rig pastas with a side of italian sausage. Literally, no more than two minutes later, our salad and pasta came out at the same time. I thought to myself, I'm sorry but there is no way that pasta could have cooked that quickly. Much to my intuition, the pasta tasted like it had just been sitting there waiting to get brought to a table. The sauce was watery and flavorless. I had about three noodles and said forget it. We sent back the salad because there was no point to even eat it anymore.  Of course we ended with the pizooki, but how can you really mess up cookie and ice cream? That was about the ONLY good thing about our meal.

Best pizza I've had in Arizona. The thin crust is the way to go. Their sauce is so sweet and amazing. Definitely will keep ordering pizza from here. Cute place but could easily pass by it. 5 star for sure

I came here the other night and ordered sushi for a starter and a burger for my entree. I just got the classic burger with grilled onions, it was fine. I am not particularly a burger person, but my boyfriend was very excited about his burger. What surprised me most is how good the sushi is here though. We got a caterpillar roll and the san mai roll and both were so delicious. Also, the sweet potato fries in a basket were yummy. This is a good place because the quality is good and there is a variety of options on the menu so everyone can find something they like. Really modern and cool on the inside as well.

Good drinks, check. Appetizers, check. Atmosphere, check. Love love love their sangria and Moscow mules paired with the asparagus and mozerella bruschetta. The hummus is great, lamb meatballs are delicious, fritto misto, and flatbreads are both quality. Haven't tried anything here I didn't like. The location to old town and the mall is ideal. The desserts are really unique, especially the peanut butter cup or the homemade chocolate pretzel ice cream cake thing. Been here so many times and always leave satisfied.

You can't ask for much more from a gelato shop than Gelato Spot provides. They have a huge selection of flavors, great indoor/outdoor seating, and I love the little chocolate straw/cookies they put in your gelato. They are open late and their convenient location in Old Town is great. I try and think of other places to satisfy my sweet tooth, but I always end up back here.

Ugh, whenever I go here it is the biggest treat. I will think about the meal for days after, still am. I went here for Valentine's dinner and it was so delicious as usual. We started with the lime sushi roll, split half of a Mastros salad (each got 1/4) and it is still a huge portion. I try so hard not to fill up on the bread at the beginning too. Then I got the petite filet and my boyfriend got the bone in ribeye. For sides, we got half orders of the creamed corn, mashed potatoes, and mac n cheese. I stick to the creamed corn only but they are all equally delicious.   For dessert, you must get the butter cake, although the chocolate cake is outstanding as well. We got a couple glasses of wine to pair with our meal and everything about the night was professional with exceptional service.

While we had a great server and the restaurant is nice and open, there is nothing that special about the food here. It's chainy and not authentic which I guess is to be expected. The happy hour menu is pretty limited and the sangria saki drink was terrible, basically guava juice. I definitely would not have chosen to come here if I was not with a group of people and probably won't return back. Convenient location in Tempe Marketplace but overall so forgettable.

Great place for bruschetta, wood fired pizza, salads, and sandwiches. I've been coming here for four years and it always tastes amazing. The four plank bruschetta musts are mozzarella, pesto, prosciutto, and the one with honey and ricotta. I've tried many items on the menu and never disappointed. Service can be hit or miss but great spot on Mill to sit outside and get yummy food.

Cannot write enough great things about this place. After visiting for the first time, I am totally in awe. The table side guac and street corn were absolutely delicious. The coca cola lime pork appetizer was also a must get. The steak tacos and short ribs were unique and cooked perfectly. This place has flavors I have never tasted before. I now understand why it is so hard to get a reservation. The pomegranate margarita was fresh and delicious. To end, we had the pumpkin bread pudding and espresso churros and I didn't think I would like either of them because I am picky when it comes to dessert. I should have known better, they were absolutely DELICIOUS. There is not one bad thing about this place, the service, or the food.

Blanco is absolutely amazing every single time I go there, which is often. I have yet to order anything that wasn't delicious. Their guac is awesome, nacho appetizer with pulled pork, cheese crisp with avacado and pulled pork, and for the tacos you have to get the crispy shrimp, carne asada, and award winning bbq. Anything! Oh and their street corn is delicious too! Definitely a favorite place of mine, 5 stars for Modern Mexican food in the Scottsdale area.

Yummy breakfast nachos...so unique and unlike anything I have had anywhere else. The eggs benedict was just okay, wouldn't necessarily recommend. I have been here a few times and the service is friendly. It can get crowded on the weekends around 11 ish but if you go earlier, you should not have to wait too long. A definite favorite breakfast spot in AZ.

The food quality has gone down in recent months. I absolutely hate their napkin policy....random I know, but they act like asking for extra napkins is an inconvenience but they only give you one with your silverware when they bring out your food. The service is hit or miss. I have been here when it has taken forever and there was nobody inside. I have also been here when my food came out in minutes and it was packed. I do really enjoy the chipotle egg burrito for breakfast and the focaccia sandwich for lunch but I find myself going there less and less.

A friend recommended this salon to me, as I am from out of state and have had a hard time finding a good hair stylist in the Phoenix area. I am so glad she told me about this salon, and more specifically, Blaire. Blaire does an amazing job and is super sweet and outgoing. I wanted to see change in my hair color and she nailed it! She really listens to what you are asking for and is efficient with her time. The salon is nicely decorated, very clean, all staff members are extremely friendly, and they use great products. VERY reasonably priced and would definitely recommend to others!

I don't know what they do to their granola but I seriously am addicted. I am boring and always get the original bowl because it's just that good. They have so many sweet, fruity, chocolatey options though. Their acai bowls are the best I have ever had. Freshly made and top quality

I seriously enjoy watching movies here. Preselecting seats makes the dreaded choice of choosing a seat in the moment, disappear. I love the recliners and it makes for a much more enjoyable way to watch a movie. I don't enjoy going to normal average theaters now because this one is so comfy and clean!

Unique tapas style food. The guacamole with the homemade style crispy tortilla rounds is a great way to start. The rockin shrimp was really good. The Sumoritas are delicious and strong as well. We had the Suzuki and Tempura Unagi roll and I have to admit the sushi was my favorite part of the meal. We also got the Korean beef tacos and the spicy tuna tacos. The portions are pretty small so it sounds like a lot more food then it felt like. There are only two small tacos in each order so when you order with another person, keep that in mind. The side of street corn with popcorn on top has great flavors and sauces and is definitely a recommendation.   Not a place you should go if you're starving and trying to eat a lot without spending a ton of money, but definitely a place with a modern vibe and amazing decor, worth trying in Scottsdale.

Postino Tempe is a new and hip place in Tempe that offers great drinks and appetizers. The wine was very over priced and the service was slow. The inside decor is cool and the staff is friendly. We got the bruschetta plank and were very satisfied however, make sure to give yourself plenty of time to dine here as it took 20 minutes just to get another glass of wine.

It's crazy as a Bay Area resident it took me being in Tempe to try Ikes. All the raving is totally justified. There are so many options and creative sandwiches on the menu. I loved the San Francisco theme to it and the dutch crunch bread was like a little taste of home. I ordered the Michael Jordan (basically a meatball sub) and seriously cannot say anything bad about it. My boyfriend ordered the Matt Cain which was also delicious. Best sandwich spot I've had in the desert and maybe even ever. Can't wait to try more choices on the menu

So glad this place has opened in Tempe. It is crowded on the weekends so definitely make a reservation if you want to sit down. Good drinks, the mules are really well done. The pretzels and fondue appetizer is always a must. The pulled pork nachos were yummy too. I can't wait to keep going back here and trying new things on the menu. The outside game area is super cool and laid back. They have heaters outside for the night and the servers are very good.

Yum, snooze is so delicious, I don't know why it took me so long to go here. It's crowded on a Sunday morning but worth the wait. The indoor decor is so fun, the music is awesome, and it's really a great place to eat outside on a nice day. We ordered the chilaquiles Benedict and the Bella Bella Benedict and split it. They were so good, but I loved the salty and savory of the Bella Bella. Definitely want to go back and try more soon.

Tried the OC sand, smores, and lemonade. They were small which I liked and interesting flavors. I am more of a sweet person so I preferred the creamy ones over the fruity but all were good. Definitely will try more flavors. Go with a group so you can try a lot because there are too many to choose from that sound good.
