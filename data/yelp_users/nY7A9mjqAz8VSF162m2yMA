Best place I have ever eaten Chinese food, everywhere should have that house special chicken. The prices are phenomenal.

They took care of me and made sure that my car was safe. They went out of their way to help me understand what was going on with my car. This is the place to go for tires! They are not all about money, they care about your safety!

The room was ok but it smelled like smoke. Someone tried stealing our food that we brought with us and they tried hiding it in their room. We had to get it back our selves because the front desk said all they could do was call them and ask them why they did it. The pool was disgustingly dirty and cloudy, no towels by the pool, and the hot tub was colder than the pool. There were cleaning carts all over the place through out the whole day. The shower basically spit at you but at least it was hot water. We constantly had the feeling that people lived there. Never again.
