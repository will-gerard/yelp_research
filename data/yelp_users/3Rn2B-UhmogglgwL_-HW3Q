I had the privilege of attending a Happy Hour hosted by my apartment complex, Broadstone 1675, at the Capital Grill. My fiancé and I were so impressed with the quality of the food and drink as well as the hospitality shown by the staff. We enjoyed their signature drink, the Stoli Doli, which is vodka infused with fresh pineapple and served straight up. It was excellent! We also were treated to a variety of appetizers such as shrimp cocktail and risotto balls. The shrimp were huge and so fresh and don't even get me started on how delicious the risotto balls were. The best part was there was a raffle for a $100 gift certificate and I won! So we are very much looking forward to returning for lunch or dinner and trying some more selections off the menu. This is very much a special occasion kind of place. Not the kind of place we would be able to frequent often on our budget, but definitely the kind of place we would chose to celebrate a birthday or other special occasion. We are so grateful for the hospitality the Capital Grill showed to us and our neighbors and can't wait to return!

This place isn't worthy of a one star review but it barely gets two stars. $25 for a pedicure and they can't even bother to use toe separators. Polish gets all over the sides of your toes on your skin. Very rushed job. Unfriendly nail technicians. They just want to get you in and out. No cuticle oil no shoulder rub nothing nice while you wait for your toes to dry. Nail technician is so lazy and unfriendly I don't think she deserves a tip. Take your money elsewhere.

Yuck. Please avoid. Waitress was super nice and meant well but that did not make up for the crummy food. My fiancé decided to take me here- I guess I should not let him pick the restaurants haha. We ordered Long Island iced teas and they were tasty but weak. He ordered a burger with bacon and it was awful. Soggy and over cooked beef. Like a freaking tire. He asked for no onions and of course it came coated in onions. He ate less than half before deciding it was time to stop. I ordered the chicken enchilada. It came with rice and beans straight from a can. They were inedible. The chicken tasted like that crummy canned chicken you get in the large cans at a Costco. Flavorless. I really hope I don't get food poisoning. The place was cheap but we feel like we totally wasted our money. Do not go here. Go to Chilis. Seriously. This might be a fine place to drink and watch some sports but if you're looking for edible food go elsewhere.

We were in Vegas for two nights and came here on our first night. I found us a deal for $39 that included the buffet for 2 and unlimited beer, wine, and champagne too! That's less than $20 a person- not bad for Vegas! I read from other reviewers that the Mediterranean section of the buffet was the best so that's where I went. After salad and bread (tasty but cold) of course. I had the couscous salad and the tabouli and both were delicious and flavorful. Highly recommended. Fiancé is more of an American food kinda guy so he had some pizza and some sliders. He wasn't that impressed with his food but thought it was fine for the buffet. I would recommend staying away from the bland American selections and visiting the Mediterranean table. We each enjoyed two glasses of champagne during the meal and then sat around for an hour talking and taking our time before desert. The place was busy but not too busy so that we felt rushed. After an hour, we each ordered a glass of red wine to have with dessert and went to check out the desert selections. They had a beautiful assortment of cupcakes which were one of the highlights of my experience here. They also had creme brûlée which I found to be delicious and not too sweet. Fiancé had some cupcakes and enjoyed them. We spent about two hours here and had a great time. We could have lingered and enjoyed more unlimited drinks but it was very hot in Vegas and three drinks over two hours is more than enough. Don't wanna overdo it in the heat. I would say this place is a 3.5 for food 4 for service (waitress was very nice- make sure to tip a dollar for each drink you get at least!) and a 5 for value. We got the deal on TravelZoo if you want to check it out.

Great free event in Downtown Tempe. Enjoyed the afternoon viewing a variety of art (paintings, jewelry, sculpture, photography) from all over. Mostly from the AZ and CA area, but a good representation of other areas too. Also enjoyed the crafts section where you could sample just about anything from cookies to nuts to salsa to oil. This event was huge! Bigger than the Scottsdale Art Festival and free too. Scottsdale charges an admission. I did not appreciate that there was an additional fee just to get into the wine section, though. I wanted to browse the local wines and was not able to because I did not want to pay an admission fee. I completely understand charging to sample, but I just wanted to browse. Otherwise, a great event and lots of fun for anyone! I could see anyone from a kid to an older adult having a blast here. Looking forward to returning next year.

Came here Friday night for a drink with a co-worker. Was super impressed by the quality of the food and drink and most of all, the service! Since moving to Phoenix I have had sub-par service at almost every restaurant I have visited. To the point where I haven't bothered going out much because it just doesn't seem worth it. The Keg completely changed things around for me. Hands down best service I've gotten since moving to Phoenix. My co-worker and I did not spend a lot of money on this outing and we were still treated like royalty. Waitress was so friendly and welcoming. Checked in on us many times and never let our water glasses get more than half empty. Must have had my glass filled 5 times. The food and drink came at the right time. First we ordered mojitos for $6 off the happy hour menu and then we ordered nachos. So in total we probably spent about $20 but you would never know that by the way we were treated. We never felt rushed or pressured to spend money. So you know what, the next time I do feel like spending money and having a real nice dinner I will absolutely go here. I know they treat their customers well no matter what. The ambiance here is lovely for a date night or night out. The patio is great- love dining outdoors! Drinks were generously sized, quite strong, and of course delicious. Can't wait to return. Finally some good service in Phoenix!!

This is a great store. I was here for a promotion with a large vodka company and the staff was incredibly nice and helpful. They made sure I had everything I needed and showed me around. Several employees came to check on me. I witnessed several employees proving samples to customers and they were working hard to sell the product. I appreciate the hard work. The store is very clean and well stocked. The smoothies at the food court are delicious and the employees serving them very friendly and helpful. I will definitely shop here.

Fabulous experience! My fiancé and I both bought Groupons for the facials and hand and foot scrub treatments. We bought the Groupons back in March, but waited to redeem them until June when we would be visiting the area. Definitely worth the wait! Gigi was so nice, friendly, and accommodating. She had us in the couples room and it was very relaxing. I was falling asleep the entire time! It was great to hydrate my skin in the 117 degree Arizona sun! Felt very good. I will definitely visit again when I return to the area.

I really wanted to like this place because it is spacious, nicely decorated, and very close to where I work. However after walking out of here twice due to horrible service I think I have given Bar Louie a shot and will never come back. You would have to pay me to come back here. The first time I came here around 10pm on a Friday night and walked out after I waited 20 minutes for service and didn't get any. Then I came again to check out their $5 burger special on Tuesday. I figured I would give them a second chance. I came at 5:10 on a Tuesday figuring I could stay until 6:30 because then I would have to leave for an appointment. We had our burger order in by 5:20 and waited and waited. By 5:50 I was getting very worried and asked the waitress when our burgers were coming and she said soon. Waitress was not friendly and had no personality but hey $5 burgers so we overlooked it. By 6:20 our burgers had yet to come out and I had to leave. I had to get the check for the drink I ordered, pay for the drink, and walk out starving. Thanks Bar Louie for leaving me starving! Please for the love of decent service do not go here. Take it from me I gave them two chances. Will never return.

Booked a painting with canvas event through Groupon and it was held here. Decided to check out the brunch before the painting class. I thought the place was trendy and relaxed at the same time. But, it was showing its age and could have used a bit of a remodel, mostly in the bathrooms. We sat on the patio and had a lovely brunch with great service. They offered $3 mimosas which were generously sized. The brunch menu was very reasonably priced. Fiancé got the "giant pancakes" for $8 and when they say giant they mean giant. I got the omelette with tomatoes and avocados, hash browns, and toast for $9 and it was delicious. The serving was more reasonable than the pancakes. All in all we spent $35 including tip and that was for two mimosas each and one entree each. Not a bad deal. We did not order any additional menu items during the painting class but the waitress was kind enough to bring waters and continue to check up on us. Great location for a painting with canvas event and would definitely consider returning for brunch.

I cannot find enough good things to say about this nail salon! Right down the street from my work. Went in just because it was close and I wanted a mani-pedi before a trip this weekend. Staff was so nice and friendly. Helen did my nails and she chatted with me the whole time- so personable. This is NOT the kind of place where the nail technicians remain silent the whole time. They make sure to chat with you and make you feel welcome and make sure you are satisfied with your service. They offer complimentary wine or champagne with your service. What a great touch. The place is sparkling clean- they open the tools right in front of you so you know they are completely sterile and have never been used before. My pedicure came out flawless, as did my gel manicure. Helen even did a glitter overlay for me due to a special occasion. It came out perfectly and dried on the spot. Gotta love that gel. Very reasonable prices- $45 for the pedi and gel mani. I will absolutely be returning whenever I need my nails done and I will be sure to refer friends. I rarely rave about nail salons, most are pretty mediocre especially those I've tried in the Phoenix area, but this one was simply fantastic and everyone deserves to know about it!!

Visited the restaurant on a trip to Phoenix. Great service and fabulous $3 margarita specials. They're not messing around with their margaritas... 2 each and my fiancé and I were feeling nice! He loved his burger, my shrimp was ok. Nothing special but tasty enough after a few drinks. Will definitely be back when we are in the area.

Awful service. Booked an appointment back in April for a 90 minute massage in June. For my birthday! Talked to the owner and explained that I was treating myself for my birthday and was super excited and she assured me it would be a great experience. She sent me a confirmation email for the date and time I had booked. On my birthday, I went to the location and it was very hard to find. She's inside a small spa with other private practitioners. Not very well marked, but ok... Anyway one of the other practitioners not associated with her business told me she wasn't even in! She was closed today! And she couldn't even be bothered to call me to reschedule my appointment? I called her to ask what happened and left a voicemail and have yet to hear back. Her website has been deactivated. Say what you want about chain massage places but at least they're more legitimate than sketchy individuals like this. She gives the massage industry a bad rap! Do not patronage this business. I prepaid for this massage and was stood up. I realize life happens and if the owner had to reschedule on me, that's ok, just don't stand me up on my birthday!

I do not belong to this gym, nor will I ever join. I stopped in Monday night with my fiancé for a tour. We are very interested in joining a gym. The gym at our apartment complex is nice but he wants more weights and I want to do spinning classes. The facility at mountainside fitness was nice but crowded. However the reason I am giving a two star review was because of the insulting customer service we received from Danielle in membership sales. She clearly couldn't care less if we joined or not. She was so rude and unfriendly and put in zero effort. Once she was done presenting membership options she told us "ok I am done with you." I have worked in sales and let me just tell you- heck no girl. Who do you think you are talking to customers like that. We did not join, mostly due to Danielle's poor customer service. Two days later we went to LA Fitness for a tour. The facility was just as nice and the membership sales consultant was welcoming, friendly, and very interested in getting us to join. So we joined LA. Get it together mountainside. You lost a sale.

I absolutely love living here! My fiancé and I relocated from CT to AZ and we had no idea where to live. We spent hours on the internet looking at various properties, wondering if each property was as nice as the pictures made it out to be. We were also worried about living at an older property because the insulation might not be as good, thus leading to higher AC costs in the summer. We were drawn to Broadstone 1675 because it is brand new and in a very central location. As soon as we called and received great customer service from Margaret, we knew we had made the right decision! Margaret was so friendly and knowledgable and kept in touch during the three months leading up to our move in date. She took her time with us and made sure all our questions were answered. She had the apartment ready for us the day we arrived in Phoenix and gave us a complete tour of the whole property. Wow- the pictures do not even do this place justice. It is better than the pictures! Absolutely gorgeous. The units have granite countertops, stainless steel appliances, and high ceilings. The closet is spacious and also is the balcony. We fit a small table and two chairs out there which is perfect for outdoor dining in the beautiful Phoenix weather. The open floor plan is perfect and allows for enough space for a small sectional and a nice entertainment setup. My only complaint is the bedroom is a little small, but that's just because this property uses space differently than our last one. It's ok that the bedroom is a little small because the living space out in the kitchen and living room is quite large. The kitchen is huge. Most amazing kitchen I have ever seen in an apartment with tons of cabinet space. I love to cook so this is so perfect. The rest of the property is beautiful too, from the resident lounge to the pool and hot tub. It really feels like a vacation with the tall palm trees and cabanas with TVs by the pool. Every night we go out to the pool and hot tub and lounge and it really does feel like we are on vacation. The property is always clean and well maintained. Since its brand new, I hope it stays this way! We love living here and the staff does go above and beyond to make sure we feel welcome. We have stopped in the office to get packages or use the printer several times (maybe a few too many times, to the point where we should probably buy our own printer...) and every time Margaret, Kelsey, and Lisette are so friendly and helpful. They also coordinated a community event just this past weekend which was a mimosa brunch. It was lovely and really made us feel welcome. The neighbors here are great. Mostly professionals which is perfect for us because we like a nice quiet environment. I would highly recommend Broadstone 1675 and have enjoyed my two weeks here thus far. They have really made apartment living good!

Fiancé and I came here on our third day living in Phoenix. After driving about 50 hours across the country from Connecticut to Arizona, we were incredibly sore and in need of some serious relaxation. Wow did we pick the right place!! From the moment we walked in we were warmly greeted by Kevin and Kiera. We were offered prickly pear water which tasted delicious and refreshing. Then, we went into our services. We each received a 60 minute massage and a 30 minute facial. Kevin and Kiera are not only incredibly talented at what they do, but they take their time with clients and make them feel valued. My massage was amazing and was exactly what my body needed after way too many hours in the car. I was also impressed with their knowledge of skincare and enjoyed my mini facial. I see they have monthly facial specials so next month I will come back and receive one of those. There are so many spas in the Phoenix area, but after this experience my fiancé and I will have no reason to go anywhere else. I would highly recommend Sonoran Serenity Spa and look forward to returning.
