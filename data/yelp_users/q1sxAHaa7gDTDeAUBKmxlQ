We ordered take out from Shanes for my birthday Sunday. It took a while to place the order because of all the loud talking going on with the other employees during my call. The lady taking my order had to yell at them to be quiet because she couldn't hear me. She then said she was going to the back so she could hear me. I ordered 2 full slabs of baby back ribs and 2 lbs of pulled pork. My husband picked up the order and when he got home we all sat down to eat and found that they gave us 1 slab of regular pork ribs and 1 slab of baby back ribs.  I called immediately to tell them what happened and the lady told me that she made sure they put baby back ribs in my order.  I am 49 years young and have been eating ribs since I could walk. I know the difference between baby back and regular pork ribs. You can tell just by looking at the length of the bones. Word to the wise. Untie the knots in the bags and check you order before ever leaving the restuarant because once you're out the door you're on your own. They will not take responsibility for getting the order wrong.

What a great place to hang out and have a cup of coffee. The staff is very attentive and make you feel right at home.  I love coming here every week for my network meeting. Elevate has a great meeting room you can reserve if you every need a place for a meeting. There is also plenty of room to sit outside during the cooler months. I love love love this place.
