This is a great place for a staycation!!!  It really feels like you are at a Mexican resort.  We went in July and got good use of the pool.  It is smaller, but served it's purpose of relaxation and had really attentive service.  The rooms are very nice and romantic.   They have a great lounge with live music and excellent mixologists.  I didn't get a chance to try the  restaurant, so I will definitely return for that, as I have read and heard great things.  If I remember correctly, all tips are included so no need to worry about awkwardly pulling out your wallet.  Highly recommend!

I thought this place was very cute inside!  You definitely get the Aloha spirit.  I was looking forward to having some Hawaiian food, but it was just okay for me.  The portions were pretty small for the price.  I had kalua pork and the chicken.  The pork was the best part.  Mac salad didn't have a whole lot of flavor.  You also get a pineapple slice with your meal.  I like what they are doing, but the food itself could be much better.

This is my favorite breakfast restaurant!  I have been to several other places and tried their eggs benedict, and these are the best!  Everything else always looks really good too, but I can't turn down the Benny's.

Thank goodness for Las Cruces bringing the best Mexican food to the valley.  I lived in Las Cruces and I'm telling you they have THE best Mexican restaurants ever.  Si Se√±or in Cruces is not even one of the best ones, but it's way better than anything I've had living 10 years in Albuquerque.  From the signage in the front, to the moment I walked in the door, it looked like the one at "home".  Just like I remember it.  Love the picture right in the front with the Organ mountains in the background.  Ok, ok, enough reminiscing, onto the food.  I loved the salsas.  Haven't had the green chile salsa in a while, but it was yummy.  The red was hot, a good hot.  I ordered a combo and everything was just delicious.  I honestly judge a true Mexican restaurant by their rice.  It's been a while since I've had some decent rice and this one was very tasty.  I wish there had been more on the plate. And lastly, the sugary sopas were the icing on the cake.  Finger licking good!  So glad this place is here, a bit of a drive, but totally worth it to me to make me feel like I have something just like home.

Ugh I hate to do this, but I have to.  Driving up I got a good impression, looks really nice, check-in staff was friendly.  We got a Casita room, and I'm thinking score-Casita.  This was not a good thing.  It is back away from the main hotel, which was not an issue, but the rooms were tiny.  The bed was tiny.  My husband and I need a King.  I thought that is what I reserved, but I didn't make a big deal about it.  Between the small, uncomfortable bed, it was noisy at 4am with people dragging their suitcases down the stairs.  We did sleep very well for 2 nights.  The rest of the grounds were pretty nice.  They have pools tables, fire pits, and a decent pool.  The pool is pretty standard and plain, and I'm not sure if they are just getting into the swing of pool season, but it was highly disorganized.  The bar staff was really nice, and trying their best, but they were running out of everything, having computer issues, and didn't know who ordered what food.  It looks like they have a plan for a renovation of the pool, which looks amazing, but hopefully they are planning to do something with the rooms as well.

For my wedding I checked with Freed's and decided to go with Marie's.  I'm so happy I did, it was the perfect experience!  I chose a cake by looking at their online pictures and it was exactly what I wanted.  I also sent them my cake topper by mail (which I was a little nervous about), but not to worry it was all there on wedding day.  One of my friends still raves about this cake!  It was italian creme with buttercream frosting.  I also went to Vegas on my b-day and HAD to order the exact same thing!  Just as good as the first time!

Not too happy with our experience today.  I was really craving some menudo and had been here one time before with decent results, so I thought this was a good choice.  I remember service was slow before, but it was during the week and we were about the only people there.  Well Sunday was even worse.  Dirty tables all over the place and don't even really acknowledge that your there anyway.  They really don't seem to care about service, hoping their food will make up for it.  That fell very flat too today unfortunately. Don't think we will be returning to Los Picos.

I think this is the best restaurant I've been to since I moved here.  You walk in and it smells as if you are bathing in garlic.  They bring out a warm, buttery garlic bread that is delicious, save some for the meal.  One of the best French onion soups I've had.  The salad was also awesome.  Very fresh and flavorful.  Portions are very generous.  Great selection of brew.  Will definitely have to go back!

This was recommended to me by a fellow Las Crucen who knows what good mexican food should be.  I am very picky with my mexican food in Arizona, so I was doubtful about Frank & Lupe's, but it did not disappoint!  If you can & it's not too hot, try to sit on the back patio.   You will feel as if you have been transported to Mexico.   The red chile is flavorful, about as close to mine & my mom's.  They have Victoria beer on tap, which you don't find anywhere.  This is legit New Mexican food!

Stop 2 of the waterpark circuit.  #1 perk is it is closest to house.  There seem to be a lot of ways to get reduced admission, you just have to look online.  This park definitely has more tube slides than Big Surf, but fewer body slides.  The water was magnificent!  Feels go good when you reach the end of the slide.  Went on a Sunday and at one point we hit a slide five times in a row with no wait.  That's when it's fun!  Wave pool is not as big here, and no boogie boarding.  I would consider getting a season pass here for the cheap price and close proximity, just for a chance to cool off.

First waterpark stop of the summer was at Big Surf.  Was lucky to get a military discount that day so we only had to pay for one admission, which I thought was worth it.  The slides are not anything too treacherous.  By body hates body slides anymore, I get banged up.  But the best part about the park is the wave pool and boogie boarding sessions!  There are certain parts of the day when they kick everyone out of the wave pool and you have to have a boogie board to go in.  It's only for about a half hour, so you get about 8 waves to try to catch, but it was so much fun.  Takes a couple to get the hang of it, but then you just ride it all the way to the shallow end.  Great workout!  They also have a big grassy area with grass umbrellas to put your chair if you get there early enough.  The food was pretty good, they grill burgers and dogs & comes with sides and a drink for a decent price.  Lots of kiddie pools for those with little ones.  I would take guests here with kids if I were to go back.

Where else  would we do our vow renewal?  Vegas!  Surprise?!  We had so much fun!  Would not recommend for a first timer (unless u you are very into this , but very professional! )  Limo pick-up, Elvis was the best, great pics!

There are times when you go to Vegas and can't stay at Palazzo everytime.  And there are times when you can't stomach the thought of staying at Tropicana or Circus Circus.  Polo Towers meets these needs right in the middle.  It is a timeshare, but was able to get a great deal on orbitz.  We had a one bedroom all to ourselves.  It was huge.  Could have easily been shared with someone else as it has a separate bedroom and pull out couch in the living room.  The place is spotless and it's really nice to have a kitchen for once.  (Plan well and take your fav bottle, mixer, and snacks).  The little balcony was also nice.  The only negatives was the outside noise, which seems to be a problem in Vegas.  Why does the garbage truck that sounds like a 747 have to come at 5am?  Also, it is a short walk to the strip, but in heels can be killer and cabs are kind of sparse here.  But I would def stay again for the price.  A great deal for groups.

I will be hard-pressed to not want to stay at the Wynn every time I go to Vegas.  The entire hotel is just beautiful!  Room colors are bright, but I didn't mind it, and I especially loved the little couch in the room.  Plenty of seating for guests.  And I like that the bed faces the floor to ceiling windows, then you push a button in the morning and there is a wonderful view without even getting up out of bed.  I appreciate the vanity stool in the bath to get ready (most hotels I have to steal the desk chair, since getting ready can be a long process).    This hotel has everything.  You never have to leave if you don't want to.  They have the hottest nightclubs, the best buffet in town, and a great show in Le reve.  I did all of this in one night without ever having to grab a cab.$$$  Pool was beautiful as well.   Very serene if you are not in the mood to party (Encore beach club), but there is that also if you want to.  On the other end of the pool they have european style bathing.  The main pool was not that busy, so no problem finding chairs, and I love when the chairs are cushioned.  Good place to just relax.  Gosh I miss it already!

I was less than thrilled when we got this hotel on priceline, but I have to say we enjoyed our stay.  A four star hotel it is probably not, but the room was clean and the bed super comfortable.  The bathroom was a little on the small side as was the whole room, but I think it's the big furniture that crams the room up.  Kudos on the drapes for making the room really dark!  Check in was the easiest ever and I was really impressed with their customer service.  My hubby forgot black dress socks, but called down and they brought some right up!  Also was a little too hungover to go out for breakfast so we ordered room service and it was very fast and not bad tasting either!  Pool is not very busy so it was easy to find a lounge chair and is decent.  They also have comp happy hour which we made good use of one particular night.  So if you get a great deal on priceline, not to worry.  No it's not on the strip, but I felt it was actually easier and faster with cabs taking the back roads to and from here.  It was very quiet, never heard anybody from our room, and you didn't have to walk a mile to get to your room.  I would stay here again if I got a great deal and didn't want to mess with a big, crazy hotel.

We had a wonderful anniversary dinner here.  You can not beat the ambiance of Vegas in the place.  So you have to go at least once.  Service is top notch, as it should be in a place like this.  The hubby is kind of a jokester and asks the waiter for "their 2nd cheapest bottle of wine."  But the waiter was cool, it's not so stuffy that you feel out of place.  Wine was wonderful, my glass was always refilled, which is amazing because I can down the vino pretty quickly.  I had the surf and turf which I highly recommend.  The hubby had duck, which he enjoyed.  All the sides that our party ordered were excellent.  Definitely can be shared.  All pricey but worth it, plus the view speaks for itself.

I hardly ever just give one star as I'm a silver lining type of gal, but there was none to be found here.  I don't know what kind of Mexican food this is, or what you all consider Mexican, but this was not for me.  Started with the chips and salsa, which were pretty flavorless and should have been a red flag.  I ordered the enchilada plate with an egg on top.  What I got is not what I have ever seen an enchilada look or taste like.  It was like a layer of fried cornmeal, some shredded beef, no wait, a pile a shredded beef, and some chile sauce that I wound not classify as red chile.  I tired really hard to suck it up and give it a try, but it only got less and less appetizing.  Then we ordered the sopaipillas and they were just meh, not worth the calories.  The waitress was not very friendly and I can't believe I spent $45 to feel physically sick.  Will not be going back....ever.

Long before yelp, I remember we ended up at this place by chance, as we were catching Carrot Top at Luxor.  I can't remember what kind of burger I had, but looking back on it, I thought "that burger I had at that place was really good."  Now, of course we all know what Burger Bar has become and that the place is pretty good.  Have returned on several occasions, which is rare, since I promise I don't live in Vegas. I want try the Surf and Turf burger, but I'm a little scared to change things up from the norm.

I am a Vegas Vet and have stayed just about everywhere, and I have to say I dig the Mirage.  It's an oldie but goodie.  All rooms have been recently renovated with earthy colors and flat screens.  No floor to ceiling windows here, but they do crack open.  (just an odd observation)  Top things to do if you stay here: go see LOVE & go to the pool.  The pool grounds are amazing and the pool itself is gigantic.  My only gripe is that hotel guests cannot rent cabanas.  They are reserved for high rollers. Oh and get there early (like when the doors open) if you want a good spot with 2 chairs together.  Otherwise you have to scope out people who are ready to leave and run before someone else gets there before you.  Overall the Mirage is super comfy, in a great location, and reasonably priced.

I was very happy with Treasure Island.  As my yelper friends know, I did get married here and this was my first time staying at the hotel.  Check in was a breeze and we were upgraded to a view.  The hotel is laid out well, you don't have to walk a bunch through the casino to get to your rooms (one of my pet peeves).  I thought the room was very nice.  They have recently remodeled and I liked the modern look they added.  Very clean, no problems, even checked out late because there was no way I was getting out of bed at 11.  I would definitely stay again for the great price that we paid.  A lot of the properties are offering a 3rd night free!   UFC fans:  They show the fights a Kahunaville!!!

This place is a sentimental fave of mine.  My husband and I had just gotten married and were having a small reception at Canaletto in the Venetian.  After seeing the line at Tao and told it was $2000 a bottle, we declined and just happened to find this place as we were coordinating something else to do with our friends.  So the price was right, we got our own booth, and it was just perfect for what we were celebrating.  They even through in some comp shots and champange.  Service from our waitress was excellent (she would slap our hand if we tried to make a drink).  This is the way bottle service should be!  We asked the DJ to play us a "wedding" song for our first dance and it ended up being "Love in this Club".  Awesome.  He also through in the electric slide later for nostalgic purposes.  Fun, fun night.  One of the best.

How is this hotel considered a 4 star resort?!  Never would have chosen this place on my own, but got suckered by Hotwire.  First we get there and valet is full, even for guests.  Then then AC units in this place suck apparently, thank goodness it had cooled down with the rain.  Went to the pool and it was awful.  No ambiance whatsoever and the water was so murky it was gross.  The entire property is very unkempt.   If your not going to take care of it anymore, emplode it!!!!

This is a nice hotel room.  It seems smaller than others in Vegas, but very clean and fresh.  Loved the bathroom.  Large check-in line, but we were early and they still let us check in. + for that.  Had a pool view room.  Either side, strip or pool, is a great view.  The real bang for your buck is the pool.  So I personally would not stay any other time than summer.  But it is so worth it.  Just get out there early and bring your own tube.  (They will fill it up for you)  Oh, and try to limit the buckets of beer.

After missing brunch the last time we went to Vegas, I was determined to make it there this time.  I thought my husband would be happy because he loves pastries and people rave about Bouchon pastries.   The ambiance is beautiful of course, your in the Venetian, but the service was a tad off and the food did not make up for it.  I had the croque madame, which was pretty good with a ton o fries.  But I felt bad for the hubby.  He ordered the breakfast americaine and you could see more of the plate than food.  And he said the cheese danish from the random coffee shop in another hotel was better.  So this was a definite miss, and for the price and quality I would go to Grand Lux any day.  At least you get a good portion for what you pay.

This was my second visit to PURE and my husband always wanted to go since he saw it in that movie Redline.  So I finally gave in and we did bottle service on the rooftop.  Our waitress was very nice and attentive,as were the bouncers.  Sometime that night our bottle got stolen from our group and they gladly replaced it!  I like the patio because you can actually have a conversation without screaming and the view is amazing.  They have heaters  and gas fire pits so it's not too chilly.  The dance floor is super crowded!  You may think that you are an expert at preserving your alcoholic beverage while dancing, but WARNING don't even try it!  It will end up in your hair, down your arm, on your dress, down to your new lovely shoes....

This is my second time seeing Mystere.  I had seen it before I met my husband and I know his Cirque taste, so I figured he would like this one.  You forget a lot, it was almost like my first time seeing it.  Like most cirque shows, the storyine is hard to follow, if there is one.  Go see Lion King if you need something you can understand.  You go to admire to acrobatics, which I think a lot of people don't understand how hard it is, especially when they make it look so effortless executed to perfection.  This is a classic cirque show that doesn't rely on Elvis. the Beatles, or water.  Do look around for deals.  If you are staying at TI you can get two for one, or go direct to the website.  We got 2 for $100.  Not bad.

I was able to get us on a guestlist, so getting in even with guys was not that bad.  Ladies free, guys $30.  It was early and this place was already amazingly packed.  If it not for Tao beach I think I would have called it a night.  Thank goodness we went out there cause we met some really nice guys with bottle service that let us sit and drink whatever we wanted, including my husband.  I don't think I have ever had a male serving for bottle service, but he was really cool.  The only con is the bathroom is a trek.

This has to be my least favorite of the Cirque shows.  I don't know if it was the late show, or stopping the booze, but we were dozing off the beginning of the show.  It was REALLY slow.  So after forcing myself to stay awake, it got a little better.  I too still do not know why they had the finger animals, but it was cool.  The"wheel of death" was one of the best parts and the most acrobatics in the show.  The fight at the end with the vertical stage is pretty cool.  I guess that is why they say to each their own because I don't know how people who have seen this can say it was great.

This is my favorite club in Vegas and yes, I've been XS.  Labor day weekend so we did wait in line a little, but only because we were with guys.  All girls can walk right in.  But we were not deterred even when we realized there were like FIFTY guys, just guys waiting in front of us.  But after a few minutes one of the bouncers pulled us out of the line (with our guys) and let us in.  Once in, drink at the bar was $15 and then we head straight to the waterfall for a prime spot.  We just staked our spot, enjoyed the water, drank, met some cool people, and danced.  Music was awesome!  I only needed one drink because it was so strong.  So all you XS lovers can head over there, I'll take Tryst.

This is for the lounge only-  Do not ever pay cover to get in here!!!  Cover should not even exist at this place, but if you can't find the guy in the casino making it rain passes, you deserve to pay.  There is no dress code to speak of- if that's your thing.  Went up, walked outside for a bit-nice view, too cold, went back inside, ordered a witch doctor, listened to music, watched bartender make witch doctors, finished drink, left, no more line to get in.  Uh yeah.

We were going to see Ka, so we decided to eat here since it was very close to the theatre.  Made reservations without a problem, but it didn't seem too busy that you had to have a reservation.  I really enjoyed the ambiance.  Lighting was subtle, low music, very relaxing.  The service was great.  I liked the comp bread with the different dipping sauces.  We didn't get too crazy, as we just went with the oyster po boy.  I LOVE oysters.  Very fresh little sandwich with fries and some crispy chips.  Didn't break the bank with this meal either.  If you are a seafood person, a must try!

This buffet is an experience!  To get the most bang for your buck....catch champagne brunch right before it ends, then head right on over to the crab legs at approximately  3:30pm.  They serve them cold, which surprised me, but they are already cracked in half and ready to eat.  If you like dessert, they have an entire dessert room.   Very good service, can't tell you how many times she filled up my mimosa, and even one to go.

My best friend felt like sushi so I recommended this place.  I had been here before and enjoyed it.  It was getting late also so this was the only place I could think of.  It was not very busy and sat at the bar.  We ordered the Viva Las Vegas roll which is the best ever.  There were also some people doing sake bombs so we decided we should try it too.:-)  We also had a tsunami punch which is yummy and strong.  They have a DJ in there so it makes it fun if you are in the mood to get your party started.  They also gave us the happy hour prices although we were a little early!

Oh I hate this place.  Overpriced and crappy food.  For unknown reasons I have ended up here a few times.  Drunk, early riser, or hungover.  I'll give you the early bird perspective since that would be the most clear experience.  I paid $10 for a crappy mimosa and had a so so omelet.  I know this place looks inviting and convenient, but just walk a little bit and try elsewhere.  I didn't try the buffet, but it's probably about the same price.

I was pleasantly surprised by America.  We were staying at NYNY and were out at the pool all day.  Someone ordered a quesadilla, which they get from America, and it was pretty darn good.  So we went for a little snack.  I just had a chicken salad, and it wasn't bad at all for a quick bite.  I can't remember what the husband ordered, but be enjoyed his food as well.  Then we had the cheesecake.  I'm not a dessert person, but it was delicious!    It's open 24 hours so we returned later for a club sandwich.  America will not blow your socks off, but it's dependable & the service is good.

I usually hit this place on Thursdays which is usually pretty dead.  Went this time on a Friday and it was wack.  I don't know what was up with this crowd, but my friends described it as "busted guy land."  I think this guy was trying to slip something in my drink until my husband showed up and he ran away.  I keep giving this place a chance, but I'm done.  Oh and let's not forget the chick fight on the dancefloor...very classy.

I could not have been happier with our wedding.  I looked around ALL of Vegas for a place, and for the price, this was the best.  The staff took care of me from the start.  (I changed my mind on flowers more than a few times)  Once there, they have a nice little room to make some touch-ups.  (They have everything-hairspray, DO, water)  The flowers were beautiful, the chapel was really nicely set up, our officiant was friendly and did a great SHORT service.  I was so nervous, I didn't want the long version!  The music was right on cue.  I chose Con ti Partiro and Viva Las Vegas.  All our guests really enjoyed the ceremony.   It kind of changed their idea of a Vegas wedding.  They do take a ton of pictures, but be prepared to pay up.  They are very nice though, and our package included some canvases which we really love.    The only thing I would suggest is if you have flowers for the mothers, etc.  buy them elsewhere.  And don't deliver them to the chapel because they do not like that.  My husband found them in a bag, I don't think they wanted to give them to us.  So just deliver them to your hotel and distribute them beforehand.

No joke.  Best breakfast in Vegas.  I crave this place.  I've been here so many times I know the waitstaff.  And I don't live in Vegas.  A must have after waking up in Vegas!  (and that can be rough)  But the chicken fried steak with eggs does the trick.

So they have remodeled a little, and changed up the menu, but still have my breakfast specials.  They are on the very bottom back page, Jacks with a Kicker $4.99.  Plus steak & eggs and a bill under $20?!  Still worth the trip off the strip.

My doggies and I absolutely love coming to this park.  I have small dogs, so I like that they have a separate fenced in area for the little guys.  The big dog area is enormous and fun to watch the retrievers and such go after balls in the water, but it gets a little rowdy over there at times.  It's a great social activity for pets and pet parents.  Glad to have this available for us to use.

Ok so honestly this place looks a little dumpy, but the food makes up for it.  I wouldn't even call it a restaurant because it's so tiny, but take a chance and try to get a seat or just order take out.  My husband likes the curry there, I'm very plain Jane, just fried rice or pad thai, and both are very tasty.  No booze at this place if that's important with your meal.

I have been a closet Carrot Top fan for ages.  The dude is hilarious!  If I could meet and hang out with one person, it would be Carrot Top.  I know he would have me rolling.  I've been twice and would go again.  Just can't get enough Carrot Top!

Had bottle service this past labor day weekend here and we had a great time.  I was looking for something reasonable in price with a great view (ie moon, voodoo) so this was the best option.  The line to get up the elevator was pretty busy, but since we had bottle service we went right up to the front.  The bouncers/hosts were pretty cool.  The view is one of the best.  It's not as packed as other places, but still busy.  I love the ice thing that you put your bottle in.  It wasn't overly loud and the dance floor is very small, but it has the view.  The best part is the bathroom!  Floor to ceiling windows and the toilet is turned facing Mandalay Bay.  Never have I loved going to the bathroom so much.

We spent a lot of time here, as we were staying just down the street at the Westin.  Bill's was the shit.  For being older, it wasn't that smokey. Great table minimums and attentive cocktails.  Hy hubby and his friend had a good night at the craps table, got us all the free drinks we wanted, while me and my BFF watched Big Elvis.  Great place to kick the night off, or end it at Drai's.

We went to this show because we were with my parents and I thought they would at least enjoy the music.  I had heard it wasn't as acrobatic as the other CDS, and wasn't sure if I was going to like that.  I loved this show!  I would see it again, and I can't think of any that I have said that about-even O.  I had a smile on my face the entire time.  The music was awesome, the stage was awesome, and the talent was amazing.  I enjoyed the more modern circus acts such as the skating ramp and trampolines.  Just really fun.  If you want to spend the money on expensive seats you can, but they are all good it seemed.  Be sure to go pre-party in the Revolution lounge.  You should get 2 for 1 drink coupons with your ticket, which is a great deal, instead of buying in the theater.

Listening to the Beatles today reminded me of how much I love this show.  I've seen it twice and I think I'm ready to go again!  Love LOVE!

Palazzo is just about as good as it gets.  I stayed here when I got married and it was perfect.  Checking in early, no line, upgrade to strip view, doorman brings your bags up, off to a good start.  The entrance to this place is beautiful!    The room is huge.  I had a lot of wedding crap, but I still had a good amount of space.  Especially nice was the bathroom.  It has a separate vanity area to get ready.  Perfect for a bride!  I needed my dress steamed so I called down, they picked it up, and it was back in no time.  They did a really great job on it.  Relief!  If you want to do up Vegas, impress someone, or have a romantic getaway, this is the place.  You know it's good when it feels like your own little place and don't want to leave at the end!

You MUST go here!  If you like to party like a rockstar this is your chance.  We got in free on guestlist, to my surprise the hubby too.  Friday chairs were $150 food & bev min & Daybed $500, so it came out cheaper for 4 of us to get a daybed.  It was awesome.  There was plenty of room for all of us to be comfy, plus it was the only shade to be had under the umbrellas.  We had the best day ever.  My friends were thanking me for insisting that we go, even though they didn't really know what to expect.  But by the end of the day we were drunk and dancing on our daybed!    Tips: Get on guestlist  Do do your hair and make-up If you don't want to spend, lots of people just put their towels down on the concrete, but don't expect any service

I wanted to try something a little different than a cirque show this time and this was a great show.  This guy is amazingly talented and funny.  My husband liked it even more than I did and I thought it was good.  He's really cool too.  He invites you to take pictures during the show and record your favorite parts!  By the end of the show you will feel like the puppets are really your friends!

I found bottle service for this place on vegas.com for $100.  Yes.  Bottle service, Vegas, $100.  No it's not the greatest club in Vegas, but we had a great time.  I couldn't tell you what the inside looked like because we were immediately escorted to our table outside on the patio.  The service was good, our waitress was nice, they were always filling up the ice and refilling the mixers.  The bouncers were even cool.  They let a couple of my hubby's friends in without waiting or cover.  The music was good, alot of MJ that particular weekend.  So if you want to drink, dance, and not put up with other clubs pretentious BS this is a good place.

Ok so I stayed here because my friends said it wasn't bad and we were trying to save a buck since we had spent our money on tics to UFC 100.  We tolerated it, but it has to be one of the worst places I've stayed.  Motel 6 is a fair equivalent.  All I really cared about was the AC worked, and it did.  The pool is nice.  The pool chairs are old.  Get the $16 football drink at the pool.(all you need is one)  I liked all trees around the pools.  I doesn't seem to get too busy, no problem finding a chair.  We upgraded to the island tower, I'd hate to see what the downgrade is.  I'd say Terribles is better.  We didn't really use cabs, but they didn't seem to come by there too much. So if you don't care where you sleep and are trying to save money I guess this is the place for you.  And once you go into other casinos and don't see silver tape covering the holes in the carpet on the casino floor, you'll know what I mean.  We did try the$19.99 two lobster tails at Legends.  Now that is a deal and it was good.

I was nervous about staying here because of the bad reviews, but I happy now that I went ahead and tried it for myself.  Let me tell you, I have a very comfortable bed, but I already miss the one at Aria.  You just melt into this bed and pillows.  And yes, you can buy it for the price of $2,000.  So, no problems with check-in, upgraded to a suite.  One of the best views of Vegas I have ever had.  Love the floor to ceiling windows in the bathroom.  Another note on the bathroom- the toilet seat is heated.  Had no problems working the gadgets in the room as others have mentioned (really now??).  The only negative I have to say on the room is the lack of TV from the bed.  You had to go sit in the "living room"  to watch TV.  Not sure if that was the plan, or just ran out of cash.  Also, we had a empty fridge for our drinks, but it didn't really work.  Should have called someone to fix it, but it wasn't that big a deal.  Loved the pool area.  Very relaxing.  What I liked about this pool is the umbrellas.  I love to sunbathe as much as the next person, but sometimes you need a break.  Other Vegas pools there is no shade to be had anywhere.   The property is huge.  There is alot to do here.  I didn't mind the dim lighting in the casino, everywhere else is super bright. The tram to the Bellagio is great.  Used that several times.  So we were very happy with our stay.  I would go back with a great rate.

Yes, the rare 5 star rating.  I can't find anything to complain about.  The room was very comfortable and roomy, with a Bellagio fountain view to boot.  I actually like that there is no casino, less walking and traffic.  Never had to wait in a taxi line, easily walked (although through the parking garage)  to the Cosmo and Aria.  The bar downstairs is a little expensive, but the bartenders are cool and its easy access.  The club sandwich wasn't bad.  Nothing overly fancy here, but comfortable and a good value for your money.

This is one of the few places in Aria to get a late night snack.  The restaurant decor itself in this place is kind of interesting, and this place is HUGE, but not all fully opened.  The service is really bad.  I asked for crackers with my soup, which I thought was a reasonable request, but felt like I was torturing the waiter.  Food was ok, but pricey for what it was.  Explore other options.

They changed the name of this cafe but it still equally as bad, maybe worse.  This was Cafe Vettro now its Cafe Aria.  Service was not good.  The waitress was as friendly as she could be, but they just have too many other tables to tend to receive good service.  Food is maybe average.  I felt like it was a waste of time & money.  Sorry.

So disappointed in this waterpark!  This was the final one we had to hit on the local waterpark rounds.  First off, it's the most expensive.  We added the extended pass for $1 more,  but still twice the price as the others.  The lines were HORRENDOUS!  And it was a Monday, can't imagine you ride more than two rides on a weekend.  IDK but they seemed to wait forever before sending the next rider down, so maybe they need to work on their timing.  Also, I think they purposely do not have enough inner tubes, so you have to rent one or you are waiting in a forever line just to get a tube.  The rides here are pretty tame.  Having experienced Wet n Wild in Vegas, I was expecting this one to also have more to offer in the adrenaline department.  The only screaming came from the freakishly cold water.   I do have to say this is the cleanest waterpark I have ever seen.  It is by far the furthest away from me, and not sure if it's even worth it to drive all the way over there- even if it is free.

I really liked this show.  Especially for $25!  Yes my husband is a poor student, so we asked for the student discount and we got 2 tics for $25ea. (Thanks yelpers!)  The characters were all very well played and the music was great.  There is an intermission, but run to the restroom immediatlely if you need it, cause it's outside the theater and the line gets long.  Couldn't have seen anything on the strip for the price we paid, but I wouldn't splurge on the most expensive seats for this show, as they are all pretty good.

You feel like a high roller the moment you walk into this hotel.  The Mandarin Bar is on the 23rd floor and has one of the best views of the strip.  This is a chill place, not crowded, not overly loud.  What the Chandelier bar used to be.  Cocktails are awesome, the cucumber watermelon fresca is outstanding.  They serve light apps, try the sliders, or just munch on the complimentary nuts, but watch out for the wasabi ones.

While I do see what the people with the lower star ratings are talking about, no question this man is amazingly talented.  I was expecting a band, cowboy hat, some running around, maybe even some flying, so if this is what you are thinking, it couldn't be further from the truth.  It's a one man operation, which I'm sure Mr. Wynn and Garth LOVE.  I'm glad I saw it, it was entertaining, but if I wanted to hear other people sing Garth Brooks songs very loudly I would go to a bar.

It took hash house to get me to set foot inside the IP.  Wait was short for a Friday morning.  Service was great.  I was a little on the hungover side so I kept it simple.  Bacon, eggs, potatoes.  Bacon was thick and delish.  Hubby had the chicken and waffles.  Bacon in the waffles?  Are you kidding me?  He enjoyed it, but only ate half.  I would like to go back and try the BLT bloody mary.  I love bloodies, but wasn't quite up for it that morning.

It's very tempting to want to go here on a game day, but you are better off tailgating with KFC.  The service isn't that bad for being such a busy place, I mean there is a line out the door & a significant wait, but the food is really terrible.  You could complain, but I don't think it would get any better.   The goal is to feed & water the masses, and that it does, but you will leave a bit disappointed.

There is a reason this show has been around for so long, it just took my 20th something trip to get around to it.  I was really surprised I liked it as much as I did!  I enjoyed ALL of the impersonators, even the ones I didn't think I would.  But, by far my favorite was Lady Gaga.  This girl can sing and play the piano pretty on point with the real one.   They change the line-up pretty often, so this is something I wouldn't mind taking someone else to.  And $60 for two tics on smartervegas.com, you can't beat that.  Guaranteed fun!

This is the place to go for March Madness.  They open the doors earlier than usual to accommodate.  They have a ton of tv's and a planned out schedule so you can see as many games as possible.  The food is ok, would have been better if they had a special breakfast menu for this event.  Maybe next time.

Just moved here from New Mexico and I'm in Mexican food hell!  Help!!!  Although more edible than the last place that was recommend, no Clamato? No bloody Mary's?  No eggs?  Horrible chips and salsa.  Always a sticking point with me, as I could seriously live off chips and salsa.  That had me worried right off the bat, so I figured a chimichanga would be safe.  Hell they are good even from the frozen aisle right?  Most uncrispy chimi ever.  And the rice, well, I'll just quit there.  Really is a shame because the restaurant itself is very well decorated and prices seemed pretty reasonable, but it makes me scared to try what else is out there.

I love the Cosmo, so why not give the buffet a try.  Arrived at 8:30 am which was perfect because it was dead.  Paid $9 extra for AYCD mimosas and bloody Mary's.  Easily drank our money's worth, but I am a buffets best friend, I get one plate and I'm done.  I enjoy that they have small, separated portions, so that your food isn't running into each other.  Had to try the Mac n cheese, and that was probably the best thing I had.  The biscuits n gravy was also yummy.  I think the Wynn buffet is prettier, you don't feel like you are at a buffet, but the service was really good at WS and our waiter even sent us with a to-go drink.

Though not the fanciest or craziest club in Vegas, I have to give Hyde high marks for the service.  Everyone was super nice, even then bouncers.  That's a change!  Promoter was prompt in returning messages and once we arrived went to check on our table every once in a while to make sure we were having a good time.  I used to frequent this place when it was Fontana Bar, one of my favorite spots to watch the fountains.  I was disappointed when they changed it to a club, but they did do a very nice job.  Does not get crazy crowded, just the right amount of people.  Can't wait to go back!

Came in during waste management, but it wasn't that busy.  We sat at the bar, ordered some apps & drinks.  I usually don't even think about doing a dine & dash, but we totally could have, and I don't think anyone would have noticed.  No bueno.

Gilbert Gottfried.  That's what brought us to BGCC.  My husband and I are closet fans and we had no other plans that night so it worked out.  It is downstairs where the monorail station, Fat Tuesdays is located.  I liked that the club had chairs & tables rather than theater seating.  Very intimate venue.  The waitresses are attentive and come right to your table for your drink order.  I believe they include a gratuity when you order something from them.  All the comedians we saw we enjoyed.  When Gilbert came on, some people left.  Not their cup of tea I guess.  But I thought he was funny, and my husband and I still laugh at some of the stuff he said, so I say it was worth it.  After the show the comics are outside to take pics, sell CDs.  A fun, laid back evening for a change in Vegas.

My dog is my baby.  I'm very, very particular about people taking care of my dog.  It's not that I'm picky about the cut or anything, I just don't like my dog to be caged up for hours, or pay extra so that he doesn't have to do that.  The paw spa was very clean, everyone was really nice, and the dogs look happy to just be let loose running around the store with the other dogs.  They are all kept behind a secure gate.  They actually did do a very good job on my dog too.  I will be using paw spa from now on.

For a little staycation, this place was great.  I LOVE that they are so dog friendly, even though we didn't take our mutt this time, we just might in the future.  The decor is very different and modern.  Super nice place.  They have a comp wine hour with sangria and flatbread pizza which was very nice.  I know they are doing construction, but I thought it was very quiet.   The pool is a little confusing.  They are trying to start a pool party but I don't know what kind of crowd they are trying to attract, as they were allowing children in.  The dj was not good on this particular day.  Hope there are better pool parties in town.  I would stay here again for a downtown event.

I had been dying to see this show for such a long time!  She is one of my favorite country artists.  First off, I have to say she is the most beautiful person I have ever seen live.  You cannot take your eyes off of her.  I was a little worried that she would not be singing live, but she was in fact singing.  One of the few artists that can do that anymore without autotune, unlike another recent Las Vegas resident.  I loved her interaction with the crowd.  Many people got selfies with her.  I was so jealous, I wanted one!  It seemed like she worked very had to make this show different from all the others out there.  At one point there was a campfire smell pumped in when they were doing that set.  "You're still the one" & "From this moment on" were so beautiful, I think the man next to me shed a tear.  So glad I got to see her at least once!

I HATE to leave my dog at home when we go on vacation, and I know my dog hates it too, but I think he is much happier at home than locked up in a cage.  Having just moved to the area, and not knowing anyone to pet sit, we turned to Kelly.  I was really nervous, but Kelly did an outstanding job.  My dog is just a little lap dog and Kelly would just sit with him the entire time.  She even wanted to take him home!  She took care of the alarm and sent pictures everyday of my dog.  So happy to know I have someone I can trust with my dog when we go on vacation in the future.

This show is amazing!!!!  I grew up with MJ, but even if you didn't, you will appreciate the music and realize there was no one like him, and there never will be another.  And that thought was kinda sad.  But they did an amazing job with this show.  Not as acrobatic as other Cirque shows, but there is enough.  At first I thought the story, with the kids was a little corny, but it brought it together at the end.  Dirty Diana-wow!  Man in the Mirror was emotional, but happy at the same time.  I will go see this show again.

I would eat here at least twice a month if I could.  Can't handle the calories or the $$, but it is definitely a treat.  My fave is the shrimp with the trifecta. The recently changed their cornbread, but still very good.  And they have Abita purple haze on tap!!!  Only thing I would keep in mind is that you do get rather messy, and the shellfish is boiled with the shell on, so be prepared to "clean" some of it if you know what I mean. A definite must try if you like seafood.

I had waited so long for mine & Britney's schedule to align.   Finally it happened and I was really excited about the show.  I came into this knowing full well she would be lip syncing, but I thought other aspects would make it a good show.  Let's just say I wanted to walk out halfway through.   I was so disgusted.  I know you are not singing, even when there are opportunities to maybe do so, but your dancing should be freaking amazing.  As a former dancer, her choreography was shall we say Mickey Mouse, and she's doing it half ass.  Kinda ironic she sings a song "Work B**ch".    I don't know how much longer PH is going to continue this rip off, but go see ANYTHING else, I beg of you.

We had such a great experience before, we wanted to do bottle service here.  Didn't feel at all like a VIP, waitress was not friendly, and my friend's purse got stolen from "our area".  I will give 5 stars to Snoop, who performed like 2 hours.

Just moved to town and I needed a new table and some barstools.  I was really having a hard time finding a furniture store for such a large city. Plus I prefer good quality, durable, and elegant furniture, so IKEA is not the place for me.  I finally found this store and was very impressed with their inventory.  I found exactly what I needed right away.  And they are willing to work with you on price.  Very courteous salespeople, they don't pressure you, so it makes you want to actually buy furniture from them.  Said it would take 3 weeks to get our stuff, we had it in a couple days.  Delivery was reasonable and they were also very pleasant while delivering.  Hope this will cover me for a while, but if I do need something, this will be my go-to.  Thanks!

I was craving teppanyaki so we bought a Groupon for Rock Lobster.   Walking in, I like the ambiance of the place. It is small inside, but nicely decorated.  There seems to be only certain times the grill is available.  We arrived at 5:30 to an empty grill, but the hostess wasn't sure we would be able to eat without reservations.  We were a party of two.  She goes to ask someone else, maybe manager, and we are sat at the grill.  Akward.  Look over the menu next, and I have a bit of sticker shock.  We usually eat at Osaka, which is closer to us, but figured it would be about the same price, even less with a groupon.  Wrong.  The food was fine, it was standard for a teppanyaki experience, but nothing I felt that justified the increased price.  They even charge extra for fried rice.  The serving I felt was smaller than other places too.  I gave some stars for service and atmosphere, but next time I will stick with what I know.

I really like to go sit outside and relax with cocktails and a view, but I don't know if  I'll be back anytime soon.  I haven't been too impressed with the food in the past, and this visit was pretty much BS.  I ordered a "smashie" which is basically a panini.  It was tiny and the tomatoes were green.  I also ordered fruit as my side & got an orange cut in half.  Not kidding.  My husband ordered the wings, which he usually loves at The Hub, but these were nothing like those.  Hope the food improves, or else your just stuck with a Vue.

Went a couple weeks ago for a girl's brunch and I must say I was very impressed.  They really made an effort to accommodate all of us & service was great.  The brunch menu was pretty extensive,  and every girl enjoyed the food.  Not to mention the several $3 mimosas that were had.

I was really looking forward to Lolo's, it had been on my breakfast bucket list.  I like the concept of southern food, mason jars, gospel music on Sunday, but the food & service fell very short.  The chicken was ok, the waffles I felt were just like eggo waffles. If that is what you are known for, it better be amazing. I've had better at Hash House in Vegas.

I love a good teriyaki chicken bowl.  Got an excellent deal on groupon for 2 bowls for $10.  I had the spicy teriyaki chicken.  It wasn't that spicy, but it had good flavor.  For healthier options, you can choose brown rice or just veggies.  It was a good portion of food, so I ate half & saved the rest for later.  I can't wait until later.  I will be going back soon.

Loved our first visit to Fat Cats!  The theater was great.  Loved the cozy recliners.  Food was ok, they do deliver it right to your seat.  I felt the prices on concessions were very reasonable.  We did bowling too, also very reasonable & a great time.  I enjoyed the neon,large screens, music, & couches.  They do have a bar, but you can not take drinks into the theater.  Will definitely be back, especially for $5 Tuesday movies.
