Oh...Macayos.  A once Phoenix staple has turned into complete and utter crap.  I spent many a high school evenings dining here after debate practices and I believe El Presidente Obama ate here within the past few years.    Things have taken a big turn for the worse.  I mean, you shouldn't expect much with their cheesy decor and a customer base similar to that of Wal-Mart, but it used to be decent - and edible.    Their menu got smaller.  Its hard to find anything under $11.  The food (even the side of veggies) was SOOO greasy and fatty. Seriously - I feel like I need to eat salads for the next 2 days to compensate for the calorie content of that dish. The baja sauce lost its kick.  The guac had no flavor. I regret eating here.

AJs is one of my favorite work-week lunch stops!! Sure, you can try and hate the fact that their groceries are over priced but you can't argue with a a pizzeria, a bakery, a deli, a coffee shop, a soup/salad bar AND fresh sushi when you are looking for lunch!   Their lunch items are always fresh and decently priced.  Usually, they have free samples at the bakery so I usually take a bite or two of that and consider it my dessert!

I miss the glory days of Buffalo.  Ten years ago while I was in high school, (gawd. I feel old) this used to be my favorite store.  It was a great place to find unique/alternative clothing at a decent price.  Better yet, I was apparently a stylish young thang because whenever I cleaned out my closet and took it here, I would get at least $65 in store credit to get some new digs.    These days,  I feel like Buffalo relies more heavily on the brand than they used to.  Its not uncommon to find used jeans here for $60 or jackets for $45 - all because of the label.  I'm sure its still a great bargain, its just not "nice thrift store" that I grew up on.  Its also become increasingly difficult to sell my clothing here - if I bring them 10 items, I'm lucky if they take one.    They need to figure out a way to improve their line to sell stuff.  I went in last night and there were 6 people already waiting with ONE employee "buying" things.  I knew I actually wanted to look at clothes before I had to make dinner, so I threw my bag of stuff I wanted to sell in the car and just went inside to shop.  They need some kind of number system where I can shop AND still have my place in line.   *pours a forty for the "old" Buffalo*

Yelp says that two stars is "Meh. I've experienced better."  But, I really haven't.  I'm a newbie to manicures - I think I do my own nails pretty well so I usually take care of them.  I'm not well versed in nail salons, but, I don't think a professional manicure is supposed to have air bubbles in the nail polish, like mine does.

What a great bunch of people!!  I came wandering in here looking to get my great grandmother's ring cleaned - which they promptly assisted me with for free.  While the ring was being cleaned I started to ask about the appraisal process and once the associate found out I wanted it appraised just for my own curiosity (as opposed to insurance purposes) she introduced me to a staff member who could give me more information on this ring - also for free.   Just by looking at the ring for 2 minutes, this man told me the clarity of the diamond, the size, a history lesson about the cut, the karat of the gold, and most impressively - that it was made in the 1920s-1930s. Wow! I learned a lot about my great grandmother's ring from these very  knowledgeable, and helpful experts!  I appreciate how well I was treated even though I wasn't dropping a dime on their merchandise.  If I am ever in the market for some beautiful fine jewelry, I will most certainly come back to Burland's.

This is my favorite stop for "new" work clothes!! They have a good, varied selection of slacks, work tops, jackets and skirts - as well as some cute casual items. The prices here are fantastic -  last time I went to got 3 items (Anthropologie, Esprit and Lucky Brand!) for $33.  The clothes are always in good condition and often still have their dry cleaning tags on them.   As is the case with second hand places, it can be hit or miss but that makes it okay to shop there every week! I've never sold anything to them so I cannot comment on what that process is like.

Full disclosure: I'm a vegetarian.   My family loves steak and I love my family so that explains how I ended up here.  I have actually been this is steakhouse several times over the years and have enjoyed their grilled portobello mushroom - it was one of the best I had ever had and I was looking forward to eating it again.  Sometime within the past 18 months, they took their beautiful portobello off the menu.  Their new vegetarian "entrée" - pick any 3 side dishes.  Are you kidding me??!! That is NOT an entrée!  As a vegetarian, I am used to eating only side dishes at certain places (like steak houses) but to have that listed as an THE vegetarian entrée is slightly insulting.  This is a fancy pants restaurant and I would expect them to at least keep some pasta in their kitchen!   The waiter lacked genuine warmth.  When I asked him to talk me about their Malbecs (they had 3 or 4), he only described 1 - their "feature" wine.  When I further inquired, he only talked more about their feature.

This place is absolutely STUNNING! The design of this building is beautiful. St. Francis had been the forerunner of my favorite atmosphere - but, I think Hillstone just overtook it!  It is very open and modern with a mid-century vibe to it.  Love it!  The patio looks cozy with outdoor furniture and a few fire pits.  There is a big piano in the bar area.   Awesome veggie burger - one of the best in Phoenix!! They make it in-house and it has a great nutty flavor to it.  They have another vegetarian entrée which is some kind of steamed seasonal veggie platter, which seems kind of boring but I would give it a shot.  Not many other veg-friendly items though.   I know this is silly, but I was really amused by the ice cubes in my tea.  They're the perfect, old-school CUBES!    My folks are regulars here so when I went with them we got great, VIP service.

Dr. Riley is very down to earth person who just happens to be really smart and have a medical degree.  I'm usually pretty freaked out by doctors, medical offices, etc. but I don't feel that way with Dr. Riley - he is very calm and a good listener.    His office is small and you can usually get an appointment the same day or next.

This place is too pricey for dry cleaning - and I am never sure what I am going to end up paying.  Usually, 4 items (a mix between dress shirts, slacks, basic dresses) costs around $20 - $25 and has a three or four day turn around period.    I've also used their tailoring services to get a pair of pants hemmed and was disappointed in the outcome - they were still too long.   The main selling point on this place was the location, it really is the only dry cleaners downtown. And the cute dog is fun to pet.  But, I've recently discovered another cleaners uptown who charges less than half and will have it ready for me the same day - that's worth a drive!

My better half drags me to hardware stores occasionally and they usually end up in 45 minutes wild goose chases that leave me cranky.  Not here!!   The staff here is so helpful they make it easy for us to get in, get out, and get started with our project.  They greet you at the door and will walk you to the product that you are looking for. This is especially helpful when I am sent to the hardware by myself (eek!) with a description on what to tell the staff I am looking for.   The prices are more expensive than your big box home improvement store, but I will eat the cost for an amazingly friendly staff and a smaller store that I won't get lost in.   A note about the name: I'm not sure why it is called Six Points, but the sign out front says Ace - the Ace Hardware website it was listed as Six Points also? Hmm...

I recently got my ear lobes (yes, just the lobes. Yes, I realize most girls go through this when they are 6.) pierced at Halo and had  wonderful experience!   I was extremely impressed with how clean and sterile the environment was, especially since I always thought it used to be pretty dingy looking from the outside (before Frances and Smeeks came around there!). The staff obviously knows their business very well, which made me feel comfortable.  My piercer was the fierce Ana who has a habit of talking to you while piercing to keep you at ease.  And as someone who is afraid of needles, I appreciated her NOT doing that annoying "1...2..3...here we go!" kind of thing.   I was a bit shocked at the price ($90 for both lobes - how much would this have cost me at Clair's?!).  But, when you consider that they used some insane, high grade of medical steel for the earrings and the overall professionalism of the experience, I would say it was worth it.   I went back 2 months later when my holes were healed up and had Ana remove the earrings she had put in there (they are tricky for a beginner!), which was done free of charge.   If I ever get another piercing it will certainly be at Halo!

My hair cut - no - TRIM at this salon took two and a half hours.  Granted, I did get some special deep conditioning treatment that had to sit on my head for  30 minutes - but that still left me with a two hour long hair cut.  Geez lousie.  The stylist was obviously very new and maybe trying to impress her boss who was near by.  She was explaining to me every.single.thing. she was doing and why, and then explained every single product she was using.  She was a nice, sweet gal - she just took forever.    I had to postpone plans I had that evening because this easy hair cut took well over the 90 minutes I had budgeted.

I have been going to Mi Patio for 20-some years, so it holds a special place in my belly.    The salsa is some of the best around, but my secret trick is it mix it with some of their red hot sauce (you have to ask for it!) to give it that extra punch! I could eat their chips and salsas as a whole meal.  For being a more traditional Mexican joint, Mi Patio has fantastic vegetarian options (but beware of the rice!) and some quirky Greek food thrown in. The price to portion ratio is very fair and $9 will get me enough food for 2 meals. The service here is VERY quick - you can be and out in 45 minutes.

Don't be scared off by the location!! Sure, this place looks a bit dingy on the lovely Indian School Road, but its nice inside and the staff is very friendly!   They have a great selection of lingerie here, as well as shoes, oils, stockings, wigs, and other little goodies.  The prices for little babydolls seem to be in the $30 range - which is a pretty good deal; Victoria's Secret would be charging $50+ for the same thing!  Its nicely decorated inside and doesn't feel like you're visiting a creepy sex shop.  The staff is also super helpful and makes you feel comfortable.

I just got 9 items dry-cleaned for about $20!! Can I get a "HELLS YEAH?!!"   I'm so happy I discovered this cleaners.  They are a HUGE step up from my old cleaners and are awesome with their same day turn-around service!  They charge about $1.25 to have any item dry cleaned and if you turn it in by 9am, then they will have it to you by 4pm.  Regal also has later hours, staying open until 7pm.  Be aware that they do not accept debit/credit cards but they do have an ATM in their lobby.   I never thought that I could get so excited over a dry cleaners.

Sachi, as a whole, is difficult to review because the all the stylists rent out their booths at Sachi.  Therefore, each stylist has different training, prices, and uses different products.    The Salon itself is classy, clean and a great place to people watch.  There is also often coffee, tea, lemonade and cookies for clients to munch on while sitting under the hair dryer.  .   The reception staff is sub-par.  There have been several times they had scheduled me to come in earlier than my stylist gets there, and many years ago when I went to get a fancy "up-do" they had scheduled me with a stylist that doesn't do styling.

In preparation for Afternoon Tea, my roommate and I spent the week talking with British accents (I always got in trouble for making mine to "poor" and Cockney) and drinking with our pinky fingers sticking out.   But even all that practice did not prepare us for how wonderful tea at the Phoenician would be!  As soon as we were seated we were offered a glass of champagne (which is unlimited, so drink up and get your money's worth!) to drink while we looked over the tea menu, there were about 15 or so to choose from.  Upon receiving our tea, my roommate and I simply poured our tea straight into our cups. You see, we're too low class to know how these fancy pants tea pots work, and we got cups full of tea leaves.  After noticing we had no idea what we were doing, a sever came over us and delicately said, "Ohhh, I see you two forgot to use your strainers." Yes. FORGOT. That's what happened! Thank you, kind server, for placing no blame on us...  Tea was followed by finger sandwiches (they made all vegetarian ones for us!) with the crusts cut off, followed by 2 scones with an assortment of toppings, followed by a pastry dish of 8 different bite-sized desserts! Yum!!   Afternoon Tea is $55/person, with an additional 20% service charge.  Its slow paced and took us 2 hours to get through everything!  Its a good place for girlfriends to go together or to take a special lady to.

I'm still kind of confused about how I feel about this place.  I had high hopes for it and was a bit let down.  Yes, finding this place is fun and I am glad I studied all the Yelp photos and reviews on how to find this place (thanks, guys!) because I probably would have given up and just gone to Postino as walking around Old Town in heels ain't my thang.   Joshua F. and I went on a Saturday night in July while they were running some kind of "Christmas in July" special.  While I truly appreciate specials and discounts, I did not appreciate all the cheesy Christmas decor they had all over the place - a fake tree, Christmas music, cardboard cut-out decor, light stands everywhere.  I feel like I wasn't able to experience the cozy, dark ambiance of this wine bar.   I was also taken aback by the prices of their wine flights ($15 - $27 for 3 - 9oz total), and $6 for a draft beer - but once you remember you are in Scottsdale, it makes more sense.  This isn't your typical Saturday night in Old Town location - a little older crowd, with a little more clothing on.  I might try this place again just because I wanted to like it so much - maybe during a week night (not in July) after I get a raise and have so much money that I feel I deserve overpriced alcohol.

I needed a dress for a costume party and I thought Last Chance would be a great place to get a cheap-o dress...and it was! But, not without a few issues...  So, little naive me wandered down to Last Chance five minutes before they opened thinking I could just hang out and play some Words With Friends until a nice sales associate unlocked the door for me. No way, Jose! There were about 50 - 70 middle aged eager shoppers crammed up ready for the doors to open! This is like Black Friday!! EVERY DAY! THIS IS INSANE!!   I almost turned around and headed over to Marshall's. But like a champ, I stuck with it. Its madness. After the doors open - women run towards boxes of purses and dig, dig, dig through them.  Then they run over to the shoes and grab every pair of Tom's they see (even though they aren't in their size). They let their children run around and play Hide N Seek in the clothes racks. They don't pick up anything either. This place quickly turned on an unkempt mess in 20 minutes.   It was one of the most stressful shopping experiences I have ever had. But I did get the perfect dress, in a good brand, for $13 :)

I have always thought of Cibo as a perfectly fine establishment - but it is the bunch they serve on weekends that really won me over!    Their brunch menu conists of many egg (frittata) dishes, some crepes, and a few breakfast-style sandwiches.  Every item seemed to come with several side dishes and Nutella is always an option for your toast!! They don't have many vegetarian dishes, but what they do have they cook to perfection.    The thing that really gets my panties in a knot is that they charge $6.50 for a mimosa!  How is a girl supposed to nicely toasty before noon at that price?! Take note that you can order an entire glass of wine for a mere $6.

I just had one of the best meals of my life at this joint!  I ate everything on my plate which is something my small stomach never can seem to accomplish.    I ordered a veggie nut burger - which is hands down the best I have ever had!  I have been a vegetarian for 6 years and have had veggie burgers all over the world, this one tops it!  I think it might have something to do with it being a "nut" burger which is not like the usual black bean or mashed veggie burger.  I also liked how it was chard a little, which gave it that comforting BBQ-like texture.  I chose the steamed vegetables as a side dish which came out as perfectly seasoned and cooked green beans.  For desert I ordered the red velvet cake (its not on the menu - so ask!), and it was the second best red cake I have ever had - the first is my mama's recipe.  I consider myself a bit of a red cake snob, but this one gets two thumbs up!   The parking lot a bit too small, which is the downside.

Ticoz, my love, what has happened to you?!  There was a point several years ago when I dined at Ticoz several times a month - it was my favorite restaurant!  They had great (free) salsas with chips, heaps of salads, a consistent and attractive wait staff, great bartenders, and delicious food.  These days, just about all of that is gone.  My final straw with this restaurant came last night when I realized they no longer serve their 3 different salsas (pico, pineapple, and hot).  They just have 1.  And its your typical run-of-the-mill "mexican food salsa" - something you would find at Ajo Al's or Macayo's - standard, boring.   The portions seem smaller and greasier than they used to, while I'm pretty sure the prices have gone up.

The Phoenix Public Market has become one of my favorite Saturday morning traditions.  Wake up when its still cool out, walk the dog down to the market, and pick up some fresh eggs and veggies in my canvas bag.  And maybe stop at Royal too :)  To be honest, I have not visited the market on Wednesday evenings since my last review 18 months ago, so I can't comment on Wednesdays - but I know that Saturdays are always hoppin!! There are probably 40 vendors and 10 food trucks to wander about, sample, and throw your money at.   There are several large farms that attend where you can find just about any (in season) produce that normal grocery stores carry.  The egg vendors usually sell out quickly - so stop there first! More and more vendors seem to be getting that iPhone/Pad credit card app, which makes forgetting to bring cash much more convenient.

Urban Cookies makes the best cupcake (er, OllieCakes) in Arizona - trust me, I've tried every cupcake shop here.  The flavors are always rich and often times creative (tomato soup, peach) and the cake is the perfect moist texture.  The price is also right, as a cupcake will run you about $2.35 - that's CHEAP in the cupcake scene, folks.   The staff has always been so friendly and the owner recently won a Food Network cupcake competition! As well as taking home the "most creative cupcake" title at the Cupcake Love In.

This is the best dog park in Central Phoenix - mainly, because its the only dog park in Central Phoenix...  We take Pogo here every so often and he always enjoys it!  There are always other dogs around for him to play with and a nice area for him to run.  I wish there was more lighting after the sun goes down - there is TONS of lighting at the nearby tennis courts, I wish they would take just two of those poles and put them near the dog park.  There are always lots of other dog moms and dads here after the sun goes down, so that makes you feel safer despite the low lighting and so-so neighborhood.

This counts as a dog park? Really?? Its a teeny tiny gravel area with no water and no other dogs.    I've tried this dog park about three times (since its closer than Washington Park) and every time we were the only person/dog there - Pogo wanted to sniff some butts, dangit!   If you insist on going to this off leash dog gravel area, it is kind of tricky to find (since it is so small and you will not see/hear any other dogs).  You need to park in the lot off 7th Street, and its in the northeast corner of the park - kind of behind Central High's football field.

It's a real dog park now!!!!  I went back to the Steele Park Dog Park after reading the more recent Yelp reviews and decided I should give this place a fifth chance...and I am glad that I did!  I am happy to report that there are two large grass area fenced off for big dogs and little dogs.  This is also the hep place to be for Central Phoenix dog owners, as there were about 15 other pet parents present.  Good upgrade, City of Phoenix, now let's work on that mythical Downtown Dog Park!!

I am so happy that I switched from Walgreens to this cute, local pharmacy! The staff is very friendly and actually remembered me by name.  Last time I came in here I had a problem with my insurance and two different staff members tried to help me, and when the problem wasn't solved (the insurance company was closed) they were able to give me a significant discount on my prescription!  That was awesome customer service and they have earned a customer for life.   I only docked them a star because of their hours - it can be a bit of a race to get over after work when they close at 6.

Super awesome Fry's!!  This place has valet parking, covered parking, a car wash, water fountains inside, a sushi bar, a wine cellar, an olive bar, hot tortillas, a cooking classroom, and a cute Asian man yelling "Riiiice caaaakes!"   This is not your typical Frys....it actually reminded me a lot of AJs - the classy decor, the beautiful bakery and deli stations, and the food products you can't find at your normal grocery store.  Of course, unlike AJs, it also had the selection of a regular ol' grocery store...  But, I am wondering if this Frys is more expensive? I bought over $50 worth of grocery, but only saved $3 with my VIP card, usually I save quite a bit more. Maybe it was the sales that week, maybe it was that particular location - I can't be sure!   Super fun grocery store to visit.  Is it worth driving 11 miles out of my way? Not really.  Maybe if had a ton of groceries to buy or wanted to make an afternoon out of my shopping experience.

The decor in this restaurant is amazing as the food - just being here makes me feel like a hep chick! I love the different textures and openness of the restaurant.   The menu here changes seasonally, based on what ingredients are the most fresh.  They even have seasonal vodkas!  Our waitress said that something like 95% of all their ingredients are bought locally and everything on their menu is made from scratch.   They always have at least one vegetarian entrée (lately it has been some kind of vegetable rice bowl) and their soups are usually vegetarian, as well.    Sometimes they show sports game on a projection screen on the patio, which can make for some classy Suns game nights!  The parking (at nighttime) is valet only.

My stinky pooch loves this place!!  We come here somewhat regularly to get Pogo's nails trimmed and get him his healthy, hearty food.    It is a decent sized store with an in-house bakery and a beautiful case of freshly made treats!  We have actually seen someone cooking up doggie treats in this place.  They have a good selection of food, treats, clothes and collars - but I do wish they had more "boy" clothes.   The other half of their property is a play area for their doggie daycare and big tubs where they do the grooming.  I think they have a self-wash area too.   The staff has always been incredibly friendly and very knowledgeable about their products.   I'm not sure what all the negative reviews are about - but it seems that this place is in new hands now.

This place is so flippin' cute! I'm having a hard coming to terms with the fact that a place with such personality is located in suburbia!  The open, farm-like, garden landscaping makes for a magnificent morning sitting on the patio and the decor has a lot of style and character.   My boyfriend and I both enjoyed the flavor of our lattes drinks, even though they could have been made hotter. The Pumpkin Spice is waaay better than Starbuck's version!    The pastry case was beautiful and filled with cupcakes (many vegan), but our cupcake did not taste as beautiful as it looked.  The icing tasted like cheap, sugary Safeway icing and the lemon cake was artificial tasting.  The cupcake was a bit of a letdown since the baker/owner/whatever has signs all over the place exclaiming "omg! I won a cupcake TV show!"   I wish it wasn't out in the boonies, I would love to hang out at this place more often.

I have ordered catering from here several times for my firm's weekly luncheons and Bertha's is always a hit!!   - Their food is always fresh and delish. - I like that their menu is "different" (in a good way) from other plain ol' sandwich places like Subway or Pugzies or Paradise - they have some unique choices! - They have really good prices for catering - you get great quality food without breaking the bank.  - The pasta salad is the best I have ever had.

Because I am a shorty, this is my go-to place to nearly all of my pants hemmed up!  They do a great job with jeans, and will even keep the original hem (which looks good with jeans) if you want.  For getting pants hemmed a few inches they charge between $12 - $15.    I docked them a star because it takes a whole week just to get them back, which is too long to wait when I have new clothes I want to wear!

Went here for some wine tasting and had an okay-time.  The service was pretty bad - our waitress did mentioned that it was her first day there but it seemed like she had no training in the menu at all.  She didn't know how to pronounce things, recommended things, or answer any questions.  She did bring senior staff members over (to answer questions) who were so friendly and nice that it made me feel like I was missing out on part of the "experience" by not having one of them help with my wine tasting.  It was very slow-paced and there were periods where our glasses were dry for 5 minutes or more between pourings.   The wines they offer are mainly blends and they are decent - I really liked the white peach one!  The prices to take a bottle to-go aren't too expensive either, in the $12-$24 range.   The atmosphere is so-so...the walls are lined with wine merchandise and accessories that made it seem a little cheesy.  At one point a staff member started cleaning the tables with a harsh smelling Pine Sol-like product which was not very helpful for wine sniffing.  On the way out, we noticed a table full of board games! We love board games!! Too bad we didn't know that option was available!

Shortly after writing my original review, the owner messaged me and kindly apologized for the experience I had had and offered my date and I to come back and try them on his dime.  The timing never worked out quite right and I had forgotten about his generous offer.  My bad!   I just tried their wine again at Devour and spoke to the owner for a little while and he is a great, friendly, knowledgeable man. He was the most enthusiastic of all of the 30-some wineries there and the Summer Rain white was one of the best I had tried the entire day!  I think Su Vino deserves more stars than I originally gave them and I am betting that my experience was more of a one-time fluke than how they typically operate business.  I need to go visit their shop in Scottsdale and get some of that delish Summer Rain!!

Walking in a desert wonderland...  The luminaries at the DBG are one of the best ways to get into the holiday spirit!  Big cozy coats, pretty lights, warm drinks, festive music.    I like that this event isn't super Christmassy - don't go expecting to hear Jingle Bells throughout the property or catch a glimpse of Santa, because you won't.  Although there are a lot of kids here, I feel like it could be boring for the younger ones, it is more of a romantic, adult night out.   There are a variety of musical acts - including some Christmas carolers and bell ensembles - but I am more attracted to the jazzy, bluesy ones!  I enjoy sitting back with a spiked drink and listening to some good, local music with my beautiful desert lit up all around.   As magical as this event feels, the price is steep - $25 per person.  For that price I wish there were a drink or small bites included.

I picked up a dozen cupcakes here for a party on Saturday and was very excited to try out this cupcakery.  That excitement ended after I tried the cupcakes. Womp womp wooomp.   The red velvet (my favorite type of cake ever) was the WORST cake I have ever bought.  Something was terribly wrong with the frosting - I had several others taste the frosting and two people agreed that it tasted like bad oil was used.  It didn't taste like a bad recipe, it tasted like bad ingredients.  Aside from the foul frosting fiasco, the cake itself was very dry.  I would have returned the leftovers of this cupcake and demanded a refund/exchange if it weren't so far out of my way.    I sampled several other cupcakes that were in my dozen such as the butter rum, chocolate, and cosmo - none of them were as bad as the red velvet, but none of them exceptional.  The only cupcake that stood out (for the better) was the Boston Creme.  It tasted the most fresh, with moist cake and creamy cream inside...mmmm.

The atmosphere is Mazie's is nice - and that's about all the positivity I can muster up for this place.   At first I was thrilled to see how cheap their martinis were ($6), but then I soon realized the reasoning behind that - there is virtually NO alcohol in them!  My lemondrop martini tasted like Sprite (ew), and after 2.5 of them I still felt perfectly fine to drive home.  Just to give you some reference on what a low alcohol tolerance I have, ONE martini at Fez will get me feeling good enough that I won't feel comfortable driving.   My veggie burger was very dry and bland - even with the tzatziki I was looking forward to.  My boyfriend noted that his "real" (meat) burger was also dry and he didn't eat half of his.   Even though the food and drinks were not up to my expectations, I still enjoyed the metropolitan atmosphere I found in Mazie's and I would be willing to try it again for brunch.

My #1 gripe with this place is the prices they charge.  $10 for your run of the mill sandwich - no side dishes or drinks or anything.  How many meal deals could I get at Subway for 10 bucks?! Because they don't taste much better...  Their menu listed "gourmet hot chocolate" and since this place looked like a cute little cafe, I was expecting something at least on-par with Starbucks mediocre version. Not even close. It was a powdered mix and hot water!! Bleh.  Thankfully for me, the girl didn't make it correctly (uhhh?) the first time around, but I told her not to worry about it once I knew it was just Nesquick and water.  The coffee was also boring. They forgot the avocado on both of our sandwiches.  2 boring sandwiches and 2 boring coffees cost  us $27.   Walking around their property is lovely and we snuck some bites of fresh pecans off their trees!  But, I was extra disappointed when I strolled by Morning Glory Cafe and saw that their prices were cheaper than my  sandwich! I would have much rather eaten there and I think I will in the future because the area is so beautiful.   I would love to visit The Farm again, but will never eat at The Kitchen again.

I try to eat as healthy as I can and specifically avoid over-processed junk - so I feel that it is only fair to do the same for my pets!  Noble Beast has a fantastic selection of natural pet foods for both doggies and kittys.  Their prices are cheaper than other local pet suppliers and they even have a little reward program where you earn $10 off for every $300 spent - with three furry friends at home, that adds up!   The staff here is always a great help and will special order any food that they don't have in stock.

I'm kind of confused as to how I ended up spending $25 on 2 lattes, 1 wrap, and 1 brownie...  The price to satisfaction ratio on this place is not very good.  The lattes were okay, but I get much better value and flavor at Lola's down the block.  Their vegetarian wrap was covered in some kind of greasy dressing and loaded with olives (even though I requested no olives).  The brownie was HUGE, but very dry.   I'm also kind of confused as to why this place was PACKED on Sunday at 3pm.  Maybe there was some kind of meetup event?  Maybe people really do love this place?? It took forever to place my order because the barista/order-taker/cashier had too many tasks and there was only one of her.

Damnit. I just got a raise but still can only afford to go to Sidebar on my birthday.    I love Sidebar.  Its urban, hep, chic, trendy, crazy, sexy, cool.  But its also very intimate and laid back.  It feels like you are in some posh city outside of Phoenix.  They have a fabulous cocktail menu, with my favorite being the White Rabbit - an adult horchata.  They also have delicious drinks with lemonade, root beer and other perfectly sweet ingredients.The cocktails run around $8 - $12 each, with no significant happy hour prices. Of course they also have beer. But that's boring.

I love this dentist.  There, I said it.  I know, I know, everyone HATES the dentist but Dr. Tran and her team and her office are amazing.    My first visit here I received a warm welcome from Brittany and was given a tour of their entire office.  I was offered something to drink and was invited to use their public computer while waiting for my appointment time. The hygienists were extremely friendly and explained everything that they were doing - FINALLY I know what is when going on when they poke at my gums going, "2...1...3....2...2...1..."  Their office is very eco-friendly and modern.  They have computer x-rays files in each room and FLAT SCREEN TVs ON THE CEILING! HELL YEAH!! They even give you the remote too, so you are not stuck watching HGTV.  Dr. Tran is a pro at giving shots, and I never felt a thing.    I recently changed from this amazing dentist due to location and am already regretting my decision.

Yum!!  I had a great meal at this place and loved their "no menu" concept!  You are given a list of meats and asked to cross off any you don't like, there is also a place to note another other dislikes/allergies/etc.  The boyfriend and I skipped all that and just wrote "vegetarian" in big letters at the bottom.   We had some amazingly rich, flavorful food and interesting ingredients.  I very much appreciated that both of us were given different vegetarian dishes - that way, I could try EIGHT different courses (four for each).  I had the best potato soup of my life here.  And I've had a lot of potato soup in these 24 years.    For the price, the portions do seem like your typical small, fancy food plates but I ended up being completely full at the end.  The cocktails were  very weak and it would probably be better bang for your buck to just order a glass of wine.      Although I loved my meal here, I think this place would be more fun for meat eaters as they have some really interesting ones (kangaroo, quail, frog leg, exotic fish) on their menu.  You also probably get the most out of what you are paying, since the vegetarian option isn't any cheaper.

Some of the best cake I have ever had!!  I'm not sure what makes a "bundt cake" (is it the shape?), but I'm a fan!  I've sampled 3 flavors of their mini cakes and they are all so incredibly moist, fresh, and flavorful!  The cream cheese icing is not overloaded with sugar (as most are) and some of the cakes have whole chocolate chips in them.  My boyfriend, who picked up our cakes, said the lady at the counter was very rude to him (is it because we were Groupon users?)....but, since I didn't experience that - 5 stars!  I think this would be a great place to get a full-size cake for birthday occasions - no more of that Safeway bakery crap!

I think its about time I wrote a formal review for this establishment, considering I have recently bestowed it as "My Favorite Restaurant" - that's a big title to carry.   I often judge Mexican restaurants based solely on their chips and salsa and Gallo Blanco passes that test.  They have a delicious green tomatillo and smoky chipotle - as well as the typical hot sauce and fresh pico.  Their chunky guac is delish and summery, as they put orange slices in it.   Although the chiccharon gets a lot of buzz (I think it taste like Cheez-Its), their best appetizer is the Elote - grilled corn-on-the-cob with cheese on it. It literally melts in your mouth! Oh, and it doesn't get stuck in your teeth like most corn-on-the-cobs tend to.   The orange cake is AMAZING and reminds me of my beloved red velvet - except, you know, orange.   I love everything about this restaurant - salsas, food, drinks, atmosphere, prices, entertainment (on Wednesday!) - they just need to get rid of that damn giant, ugly, silver air conditioning thing they have running through the bar.

We went here last night for a late dinner and some beers and had AMAZING service!  I knew I wanted to try the lavosh, but was a bit bummed when I saw that the only vegetarian one was covered in olives (bleh).  The "LB Special" sounded tasty, with a bit of a Mexican theme but had bacon on it.  We asked the waitress to substitute the bacon for anything the chef wanted - as long as it wasn't olives (or meat).   The chef personally came out to talk to us about what wanted on the lavosh instead!  Beans? Yes.  Chilies? Yes.  Onions?  Yes.  Pico?  Yes!!  It was awesome! Instead of getting bacon, we got four delish veg-friendly toppings for the same price.    They were overly accommodating with our vegetarian diet and I really appreciated that the chef came out to talk to us about what he could do with the lavosh.    Oh and it was delicious, by the way!

CLOSED :(  We went here for lunch today to find it all locked up.  Peering in the windows, we could see all the refrigerators were empty.  We went to ask someone who worked at the Vietnamese restaurant and he said the restaurant was "no more."    SO sad to see this vegetarian/boba joint go!

Really people?  Maybe the meat dishes here are good. That's the only way I can understand why this place has such a large customer base.  Initially, I was excited to see a Vegetarian section on their menu with about 6 items on it.  We got one dish with tofu & vegetables, and another dish with vermicelli and fake pork.  The tofu dish tasted like it was cooked in fish sauce, and aside from it not being truly "vegetarian," the tofu was awful and the wheat gluten meat is something you can buy in a can.  The other noodle dish was so bland that we had to add FOUR different sauces to it, just to give it some kind of flavor.   I will give them props for being cheap...but we definitely will not be returning here.   Oh, and their parking lot reeked of trash-juice-smell.

I did this "boot camp" for a month after purchasing a Groupon where it was only $30, and I am glad that I didn't pay much more for it.  It is much less of a boot camp, as it was just a fitness class.  I was wanting to someone to push my limits, yell at me to run faster, and be more Drill Sargent-like (it's boot camp, right?)!   Alas, it was very similar to a group class they offer at LA Fitness - light running, some hand weights, some squats.    I was VERY disappointed that we were not measured or even weighed when the class started and when the class ended.  I felt like that should be something standard!  So, I honestly have no idea what difference this class made (if any) to my body...my pants aren't fitting any looser, but I would like to think I lost a little something.  Our instructor was definitely an alert, positive ball of energy at 5:30am which was nice...but, still, I didn't feel like I was being pushed to my limits.  All in all, this class was fine for $30/month, but I would NEVER pay the $100+/month that it normally costs since I can find the same class at my gym.

I feel like Giant Coffee is my "special treat" kind of place for when I need to pat myself on the back.  Kind of like when I decide to buy groceries at AJs.  Their prices are significantly more than what I pay for my "everyday" latte, but their product is exceptional!  The iced honey vanilla latte is the best iced latte I have ever had and it tastes great every time.  To be honest, I don't think I have ever tried anything else here.  No need to!   The atmosphere here is one of my favorites if I want to get some reading done - I feel like its less distracting than other coffee shops and has big windows that let in the beautiful natural sunlight.

Something I enjoy about Lola's (as opposed to some of my other CenPho coffee favorites) is that it is CONSISTENT!  I do not have to worry about which barista is working or what drink I order - it is always good.   -The staff is always friendly and takes time to get to know their regulars. -They always have great music playing.   -Aside from their pastry case, they usually have some hot food you can order.  -They have the best whip cream around - seriously.  I never order whip cream at any other coffee shop, but I really don't mind those extra calories here.    My least favorite things about this place: their seating.  Yes, those old metal school chairs look fabulous - but they are cold and uncomfortable!  If I'm going to hang out there for a few hours, I don't want my butt to go numb from uncomfortable seating.

What?!? There is a Cartel Coffee downtown?! How did I miss this for so long???!!   I only "discovered" this location while aimlessly wandering around on my lunch break a few weeks and have been back weekly since!  The staff here is great and friendly. And, as one of them told me, they treat coffee like more of a science here.  They know their stuff and are always sure to highlight some of the tasting and flavor notes within a particular blend.  Their toddys are the best I've had and their pastries are divine! And to make it even better, their baked goodies are all half off starting at 1:30 in the afternoon - which happens to perfectly match my lunch hour.

Omigawd - This place is so much FUN!  Its like going to a wine tasting...but with vinegars and oils.  I've always stated that I would rather spend money on a nice bottle of balsamic than a nice bottle of wine, so I was surprised I had never heard about this place until Groupon promoted it.   Upon entering this small, tucked away shop you are greeted and encouraged to try EVERYTHING in this store.  They give you itty bitty cups so you can sample each balsamic and itty bitty pieces of bread so that you can sample each olive oil.   Some of the flavors are quite surprising and original - dark chocolate balsamic, pomegranate balsamic (we went home with this one!), orange EVOO, etc.  They offer advice on what foods pair well with what flavors, and how to pair up the different vinegars and oils (one combination tastes just like orange Starbust!)   One of the best parts about this store (as if it can get any better than doing shots of balsamic!) is the staff - they certainly know what they are talking about and very friendly.  As an added bonus, the man helping us gave my boyfriend and I a card for a FREE margarita at a restaurant down the street.  Not too shabby, kind sir.   I very much enjoyed my experience here and cannot wait to finish my two bottles of balsamic so I have an excuse to go back!

I just can't like this place.  I've been here a few times, tried multiple items, and was hopeful each time...but my end reaction is always "meh."   All their beer and wines are from the good ol' US of A - I think their wines are really over priced for what they are.  Happy hour only lasts until 6 and the only wines on happy hour are their house wines. Meh.  They do have a few vegetarian dishes - mac n' cheese, grilled cheese, a salad or two, and a roasted veggie sandwich. None of it really wows me with flavor and the veg sandwich tastes greasy. Meh.  I like the cozy atmosphere - the inside is dimly lit and the patio is a lovely area where you don't feel like you are sitting right on 7th street.

Pita Jungle is one of my favorite places to go for reverse happy hour after 9pm.  They have $1 - $3 little tapa plates and we usually split 5 or 6 of them!  Hummus, olives, mozz & tomato, garlic potatoes - yum!  That way, you get so much variety.    I love how vegetarian friendly their menu is and I enjoy that I can try something new almost every time!  My favorite is the Thousand Bean pita - its so huge that even when splitting it with my man we are unable to finish it!  I wish their staff was more friendly.  On more than one occasion I've had staff be outright rude.  All other times, it never goes above mediocre.    Also, whats with the weird pita to hummus ratio?! From the name, you would expect an entire jungle of pita bread. There is always way more hummus and never enough pita...I am okay with eating my hummus with a spoon. I just don't want people to look at me funny.

If this place only served chips and their salsa bar, I would still give it 5 stars!  As a salsa and hot sauce (they're different, people!) fanatic, I tend to judge Mexican food joints based on their quality of salsa - and La Condesa ranks high!  Last time I was there, I counted 10 different salsas and 2 or 3 different condiments (limes, onions, etc.).  They offer a wide range of salsas from their exotic strawberry salsa, to spicy chipotle, or creamy cilantro.  It looks a little silly with 8 little cups on salsa at your table, but you have to try them all!   The horchata here is also 5-star material.  Don't be a cheapskate - shell out the $4 for it! Its giant, it will make you happy. And, when you're done with it you can eat the fruit and nuts - the drink keeps on giving!   I have been here twice and have only eaten the veggie tacos, 2 of them are enough to fill me up and they are very delicious!  I must say I am not a huge fan of their rice and beans, which seem a bit bland to me.  But, the tacos, salsa and drinks all make up for some plain 'ol rice!   I was very  happy to see a decent sized crowd here on my most recent visit and that La Condesa is applying for a liquor license.  This place needs to stick around for awhile!

The tension was high as soon as I walked into this spa for a treatment - an employee and a customer were arguing about something.  I was not even acknowledged after several minutes (due to the argument) and then the employee went off in a huff to the back.  Once a new employee came out, I gave them my name and sat back down to wait for my esthetician.  As I was waiting, the original employee and the new one were talking about how rude that customer was, rude customers in general, etc.  I thought that was highly unprofessional to do in front of me!! I understand venting in the back room...but, I've worked in customer-driven jobs and you do not say those things in front of another customer.  Anyhow, I ended up getting the employee who was in the argument as my esthetician and I could literally feel the negative energy and stress projecting from her. It was not a relaxing environment at all.   They also should have been more knowledgeable...when I asked if it was okay to put on some makeup that evening (after a treatment), I was "answered" with, "hmm...thats a good question."  I thought that was a pretty basic question!

Seven months after writing my review, I was contacted by the owner who said the experience I had was unacceptable and he refunded my credit card for the entire service - including tip!  I was very impressed with the customer service, albeit a bit late, and very much appreciate him taking the time to contact me.

America's has always had a consistent and delicious bean&cheese burrito.  Its not the size of something you would find at Bertos, but its waaay better quality. They only have one other vegetarian entree - a veggie quesadilla.  I do wish they had more veg options and all of their specials seemed to be geared towards their meat eaters.  I think their refried beans and tortillas are heavenly!  The flan is homemade any yummy, too!  It drives me bonkers that they are so dang stingy with their salsa! They make me feel like they are doing me a super-exclusive favor if I ask for extra.

Wow.  There are a lot of instruments here. A LOT.  Almost to the point where its overwhelming and you don't care to see another foreign instrument anymore and just want to go to the room where you can touch/play some of them.  That's what happened to me anyways.   Upstairs is their collection of instruments from around world - divided up by continent, and then further divided by country, and then some further divided by time period or region.  This is the part where I was overwhelmed. There was SO much to look at and SO much to listen to.  We started off listening to and looking at every country, then we just looked, and then we just walked around to the countries we were interested in.  There is a room on the bottom floor where you can play some of the instruments - including a giant gong! yesss!!

I had brunch with my family on the patio at El Chorro this morning, and I was quite disappointed with this landmark restaurant.  We sat on the patio - which was absolutely beautiful (and the reason this rating gets any stars!)  and had an amazing view of Camelback Mountain.  There was also a fair amount of heaters and fireplaces, so it would be nice to sit out there in colder weather, too.   It was pretty fun to people watch here - everyone was so expensive looking! And, at 23, I think I was the youngest person there by a solid 15 years.   The service here was extremely sub-par, especially considering the prices they charge.  We were greeted with a "you have reservations, don't you?!"  No, we don't. And now you just made us feel like we did something wrong by not making them - even though there was plenty of seating!  We were seated right away, regardless.   And, it goes downhill from there. The waiter was unfamiliar with the menu and had to have us point to several items on the menu.  The bus staff that brought us our food had quite a hard time reading the ticket that told them who ordered what, it would have been much faster to ask, "who had the french toast?!"  I was brought the wrong dish, and when it came out the second time, the eggs weren't cooked how I asked.  It took a good 15 minutes to get our credit card back from the waiter after we had given it to him to pay.  I tried to give the staff a little credit, because this place is brand new - but you think in this economy they could hire some experienced wait staff!   I thought the prices were ridiculous - $6 for a side of 2 eggs?! $13 for a fruit bowl!? Ouch.  As much I would like to come back for drinks on the patio at sunset, I don't think I can justify dealing with the staff and prices again.

What a great location! Finally a doctor's office that I don't have to take an extra half hour off work just to drive there....Downtown Dental is a mere block from work and just over a mile from home - perfecto! Apparently, they validate parking but they will also let you park your bicycle inside :)   Setting up and appointment was easy as everything can be done by computer/email. Bonus: they actually check and answer their "general" email.  Their office is modern and x-rays are immediately transferred on to the computer screen. My hygienist was very friendly and I was never made to feel guilty about my flossing (or lack thereof).  She also skipped the whole song and dance of "You need to stop drinking soda" "Uhh...I don't drink soda" that seems to happen at every other place. Nice!   Dr. B was very friendly and told me my teeth looked so good he thought that I had had braces at some point. Smooth.   The one thing that I'm not so sure about is how OPEN this office there.  There are no doors or walls between "rooms" - just cabinets that separate each dental chair. I understand this is cool and modern, but I could literally hear loud and clear the patient's prognosis next to me (sorry about your gums, buddy!).  A little more privacy would be nice.

Sportsman's is on top of the game when it comes to wine! The staff is more knowledgeable and helpful than any other place that I have bought wine at before. I didn't feel like I was being judged for trying to find a cheaper bottle and there was no pretentiousness in the air. While I was inquiring about dry resling, one of the vino gurus offered to get me a taste of one from their bar - and came back with TWO samples for me to try!   Sportsman's also has a very intriguing liquor section - I enjoy wandering around and looking at all the fabulous bottles I have never seen nor heard of.   Several times a month, they offer complimentary wine tastings and special discounts on most of the bottles being sampled.  They also have a full service restaurant/bar off to the side where they have a huge "by the glass" list - you are also welcome to pick out any bottle from their store, they cork it free of charge, and you can enjoy your retail priced bottle with dinner!    The portabello sliders that I had for dinner were amazing and I am still having dreams about them!   My one complaint is petty: their website.  Its overrun with text and finding important information is difficult, it also needs to be better updated with their amazing tasting events!

Devoured is my holy day - my Christmas, my Passover, my Winter Solstice, my everything.   This year they showcased nearly 50 local restaurants and 30-some wineries.  There were several live music acts and people watching to last all day.  This event is held the perfect time of year - its a nice warm outside, not too hot.  Yes, it can get a bit toasty when standing in the direct sun while consuming alcohol, but that's nothing an ice cold Mai Tai from Hula's won't fix.  Being a vegetarian at this event is not an issue.  There are plenty of vegetarian options and many chefs will make you a special little plate of their dish meat-free. I sometimes feel a little left out when some of the big-name, popular restaurants don't offer an option but I can go stuff my belly with something else!   I do wish they would cap the number of tickets sold to maybe 2,000 a day. I feel like every year this event gets more and more crowded.  My poor dad who recently had surgery on his feet did not enjoy this event at all because the sheer number of people bumping into him made him uneasy.   Also, what's up with Tammie Coe "selling out" at every food event I go to before I can try anything?! Bring more food, chica!! You know you're popular!!

My first week at Gold's has been a bit of a clusterfuck. The staff seems to have no idea what is going on and can't tell you simple things like where a class is or how much a membership costs.   The gym is nice, the staff just needs to get their act together.  I will continue to come here despite my bad first, second, third and fourth impressions and will update the review if the staff gets their act together!

I forgot my bike lock and Gold's refused to let me park it in their large, empty lobby (despite the fact I have seen bikes parked there before).  The manager blamed it on GM, and when I asked to speak the GM of course he was "busy."  I know customer service is supposed to be awful at gyms, but Gold's really goes out of their way to be extra unhelpful.  (*kudos to the young kid who they had folding towels that offered to watch my bike unlocked outside - very kind offer, but I didn't want to put a personal burden on him)

I was excited to try the new Picazzos location (I loved this place when I lived in Flag!) but arrived to a sign on the door saying that they are shut down because they didn't pay their rent - wtf?!  It ruined our dinner and a movie night out...

I like these dogs because they are more like a sandwich than your typical American Frank.  They are served on a delicious flat bread/pita  "bun" and are filled with all sorts of toppings - not just ketchup and relish- I'm talking beans, cilantro, onions, chipotle, cheese, and peppers.   And yes, they do have a vegetarian one!! Their mock meat looked so real it was eerie - I took a nibble and I couldn't tell if they had accidently given me a real hot dog!  So, I tore off a little chunk and showed it to the hot dog man, "This is a vegetarian one, right?!"  He laughed and said, "Yes.  We actually get that comment quite often."

This joint used to be my favorite work-week lunch at its old location.  Then, I got a new job and was sad I could no longer walk to my favorite wrap wranglers. Amazingly, perfectly, divine-interventionly their new location opened up down the street from my new work!   This place is wonderful for vegetarians - all meaty wraps can be substituted for a delicious grilled tofu, and several wraps are beautifully meat-free to begin with.  My favorite is the Prince of Thais (they have cute names for their wraps).   The selection is large and the portions are generous - I don't think I have EVER finished my whole wrap and side dish in one setting, I usually split it with the boyfriend and we are both full and happy and healthy.   At this new location there is plenty of parking, and seating, and a large outdoor patio.  They are also expanding their hours and getting an alcohol license.

I am hesitant to give this establish a bad review since I went on there on opening night, but I had such a bad experience that I can't muster up the kindness to give them anymore.  I arrived there about 15 minutes before happy hour ended, which I thought was still plenty of time to get my drinks ordered. Since it was their grand opening, all their drinks were 3 for 1 until 7pm. I ordered a $9 martini and was given my drink along with 2 tickets/coupons that I was told could be used for the other 2 martinis and I could even use them at a later date if I didn't use them all tonight.  At first, I thought this was a great idea - it seemed like I was getting my 3 drinks, without having to order them all at once!  As it turns out (after I ordered 2 more $9 martinis) that these coupons can ONLY BE USED DURING HAPPY HOUR.  No one told us anything about that until it was time to pay, there were no signs posted, and it seemed that other customers were confused by this as well.  I spent an additional $20 on martinis (since I thought they were part of my three) that I wouldn't have otherwise.   Aside from the costly drink confusion, the food was mediocre at best.  The french fries were undercooked and we were charged $10 for our bland nachos, even though the menu stated $9. They also need more vegetarian options.  We sat around for a good 15 minutes before a server came to take our order. The drinks were weak - I had THREE martinis (don't judge me!) and felt the same way one Fez martini makes me feel.  I still have my HAPPY HOUR ONLY coupons/tickets that I need to use - so, I guess I will go back.  I had high hopes for this restaurant, as is expected from the people that gave us Fez.

This is one of my favorite events in Phoenix - I can't believe that I didn't review it last year!!   Cupcakes. Cupcakes. Cupcakes. I love it!!! There are a few dozen bakeries/restaurants here each with multiple cupcake flavors. Since its easy to overdose, even on the mini cupcakes, my partner and I usually split 1 mini between the 2 of us, that way we can try many without going in to a diabetic shock.    I always appreciate the "weird" flavors - this year, I have to give a special shout out to Urban Cookies for their tomato soup/grilled cheese cupcake and Barb's for their chocolate chipotle cupcake.    This year, the event organizers attempted a "tasting ticket" system where you were supposed to only get 6 or 7 samples...to everyone's fortune, very few bakers followed this rule and were handing out samples left and right to their adoring fans.  Thank you, bakers!!   There are also really cute t-shirts, cupcake eating contests, amazing raffle prizes, free photos, coupons galore, cocktails and more cupcakes.   I love the location this event is at - The Valley Ho Hotel - although a slightly larger space would be nice.   Alright, I'm off to the gym...

My favorite yogurt joint in all of Phoenix!  I like it better than the other competitors because:  - Its CHEAP - Super friendly staff - Froyo flavors change regularly - its fun to try new ones! - Half off on Wednesdays if you wear your jammies! Double awesome!  - Interesting toppings - lemon syrup, maple syrup, mochi, etc.  - Clean, open store

The lattes here are great - they are my #2 favorite in all of Phoenix and are one of the reasons (Royal being the other) that I was finally able to quit Starbucks for good!  I usually get the white mocha which isn't too sweet.  I also really enjoy their chai - its not from some sugar loaded concentrate crap and you can actually taste the spices!  I've been meaning to try the toddy and will get around to it now that its warmer.   Great espresso aside - going here makes me feel kind of lame.  I feel like everyone here knows each other!  The baristas all know every other customer and everyone is waving to each other and talking to each other and I'm just here  alone. Playing Scrabble on my phone.   This coffee shop is one of the most hipster filled places I have ever been to and it fun to people watch and oogle at the cute fixie bikes.  On Sunday mornings they have a live DJ.

I have to write a review for Jimmy John's customer service because I am always so impressed!  Their sandwiches are lackluster - especially the vegetarian one - but their 5 star staff makes up for it.  The staff here always goes above and beyond - they are always quick, efficient, and do little things that end up making a big difference.  For example, I've had to order box lunches for office meetings several times. When taking my order over the phone, the person will ask me what name they can write on the bag for that particular item - that way, I do not have to go through each box, opening up the sandwich, trying to figure out who gets what back at the office - genius! And so simple...  When they were doing their special $1 sandwich promotion, I decided to stop by, even though the line was out the door and several stores down.  My cheapness kicked in, and I was ready to spend my whole lunch break waiting in 110 degree heat - but Jimmy John's wouldn't let that happen! I had was inside and had my sandwich within 12 minutes. Super impressed! The manager also gave me one of their pickles for free when  I told him I had never tried them.  Keep up the good work, JJs, but maybe add a little more "meat" to the veggie sandwich...

Weird experience here.    Up until the end everything was pretty fine, okay, mediocre.  The server seemed pretty awesome and the food was filling.  But then things started to get a bit uncomfortable...  As a vegetarian, I ordered the veggie tacos. They come with a side of rice and beans - but, the rice has chicken broth in it.  I asked the waiter if I could skip the rice (as its not veg friendly) and just get an extra side of beans instead.  He said that would be a-okay!  Once the bill came, I handed over the credit card without checking the bill (I know...my fault there!).  Upon reading the receipt I realized we had been charged $3 for that "extra" side of beans. The waiter got a bit defensive and tried to explain himself, but eventually gave in by pulling out his tip money from his pocket and giving me $3 cash.  It was very awkward to be straight up taking his money like that and made me feel bad/weird.   Without that experience, this place would have been given 2.5 - 3 stars.

So, I just discovered this place at the Public Market on Wednesday night and loved it.  Then, on Thursday morning I read in the New Times that a location just opened up at the Biltmore (right near my work!!).  I think that's the best proof I've seen that there IS a god!   This place is hard to find so let me spell it out for you: GO IN THE RED DOOR!! Yes, its INSIDE the salon.  It has the bottom floor all to itself, and I suppose the salon is up the elevator on the second level.  There is only seating for about 6 customers and it doesn't feel as cozy as most coffee shops do. It seems more like "grab and go" coffee place, and the Biltmore is not really a "grab and go" type place.   But the lattes are amazing!!  Such a good rich flavor and not overloaded with sugar.   I hope this place survives okay.  Its hard to find. Hard to park. And lacks a coffee shop atmosphere.   5 stars for the lattes, 2.5 for the location.

They have more seating now, including outdoors.     Even though I previously complained about the parking - it has never been an issue for me.  The lot right across usually has heaps of free spaces and if you go for early morning coffee you can sneak a spot right out front by the valets.  THEY HAVE ALMOND MILK!!   Seriously, these are the best lattes I've ever had - I'm sorry I gave them 4 stars. I take it back!!

This place is going to turn me into a alcoholic.  The cocktails here get five, big, huge amazing stars.  They are as great as everyone says they and you will want to order "one of everything" - and that's okay.  I started with the Citi-Zen as the waiter said it was their most popular and I was not disappointed. I followed that up with a traditional Pisco Sour - I say traditional because they include a RAW EGG in their recipe - just like the pisco sours in South America!  The menu is slightly lacking in the 'vegetarian' department, but to be fair our waiter did offer up an off-the-menu risotto type dish for my honey and I.  Instead, we ordered this grilled cheese type sandwich. Okay, but get this, the cheese itself is grilled. Its this weird/awesome Middle Eastern cheese that doesn't melt easily so they put a thick cheese slice on the grill! YUM!!   Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable in both the food and cocktail menu and brought us out a complimentary dessert for our anniversary.The decor itself was kind of plain and lacked in the ambiance department - but after two or three Pisco Sours, who cares?!

So, I was about 15 minutes late to my dinner date here (thus, missing happy hour) since its so hard to find.  And then even harder to park.  Then I had to walk a block.  I should have just rode my bike.  The atmosphere is very typical to other Sam Fox restaurants - loud, open, big pieces, attractive waitstaff, private rooms.  My party split a number of appetizers and I have to give a special shout out to the soft pretzels with fondu and home made chips with onion dip! Yum! Its dangerous having that many delicious carbs...  They only have one vegetarian entree - but several appetizers and salads could also appease a meat-free palate.  I ordered the sweet potato tortellini and it was divine! It so rich and buttery that I almost felt like I was eating a dessert - I didn't know that a sweet potato could literally taste so sweet! I'm glad that I split it with another person, because it would have been too rich to tackle on my own.   The kale salad was mediocre and didn't come with almonds as the menu said - but some other kind of nut.  I much prefer the kale salad at True Food.  After splitting 4 or 5 appetizers, and then dinner...there was no room for dessert.  I would come back here during happy hour for some drinks and soft pretzels!

I absolutely love this idea and had a great time here.  Since it was kind of confusing what to do, let me break it down for you:  - Go in, and order your drink at the bar.  They have happy hour till 7 (woo hoo!) where drinks are $1 off. - If you are going to see a movie, also tell the bartender you would like to purchase a ticket. - Once you receive your drinks - go on in and grab a seat! I don't think any of us received any physical tickets, so don't worry about that. - Enjoy your drink and movie! Feel free to get up and leave if you want more drinks.   The theater is smaller and intimate - with seating for about 60.  The back area is nice with high tables and bar stools.  About an hour into the movie, someone came around to the back tables to see if we wanted more drinks.   My main complaint is the service.  It was really busy when we went but I still found it unacceptable that I had to ask for a glass of wine THREE times (from the same person) over a 15 minute period before I received it.  Despite the service, I had a great time and can't wait to go back!

I love FilmBar so much and had to write an update for them giving them the 5 stars that they deserve!  It seems that they have worked out some of their newly-opened-business kinks and everything is now wonderful!  I've been going to FilmBar at least once a month (although usually twice) for the past 5 months because they have such an amazing lineup of truly independent films.  On Monday nights they let a local organization show a film and keep the profits from ticket sales - a great idea!!  They now offer beer on tap and popcorn - something I had been anxiously awaiting.

I've never been a huge Vietnamese fan, but Rice Paper has shown me the light! This little joint is run by two sassy sisters who are a hoot to be around and make delicious food.   The spring rolls here are amazing - I think its the best thing on their menu - and they are so cheap that you can order several of them, tapas style!  They are always made with fresh ingredients and are packed with flavor.  I also love the vegetarian pho.  It may seem expensive but it is HUGE and comes with a number of ingredients - tofu, lime, mint, jalapenos, sprouts, onions.  Whenever I am in a soup mood I turn to that pho.

I had a fantastic meal at Windsor and cannot wait to go back!!  The problem is, they do not have very many vegetarian entrée options.  I think their only entrée is what I ordered - a veggie filled pita.  It was amazingly delicious, but I wish I had more options than that....or a salad.  I appreciate that this restaurant uses lots of kale and quinoa in many of their dishes - they are two of my favorite foods and are highly underused!!  The No. 89 is one of the smoothest cocktails I have ever had and would visit this place just for cocktails.  They also have wine on tap - which is supposed to be more environmentally friendly.  The music was too loud inside and the waiter could have been more attentive - but it was their opening week so I will let that slide.

Wow!!!   This is the best ice cream I have ever had - seriously, folks, this place shows Sweet Republic who's boss.  The ice cream is rich and creamy and full of flavor.  I tried the butter pecan, banana, peanut butter and chocolate.   The chocolate was unlike any chocolate ice cream I have had before - you could actually taste the coco flavor and it was more satisfying than a sugar loaded Hershey's concoction.  Bonus - they have pretzel cones!! This went especially well with scoops of chocolate and peanut butter! Yum!!  I hopped on the froyo train for awhile there, but this place is going to cause me to derail and get fat.  Oh well.  I'll be happy.   The interior is a very cute, old-school ice cream parlor.  It reminded me of Smeeks.  There was not seating inside, but about 5 tables outside.  They also have lots of retro candies and freshly baked cookies and complimentary water in a jug (flavored with lavender and lemon).  I've already forgotten that Mary Coyle's is closing down...

Its a shame that this place put the Improv out of business. That laughs that I had here were not enough to make up for the outrageous drink prices and poor service.   First off, we could not get a straight answer from ANYONE about what the policy on drinks from Copper Blues is - we were told different things by the box office staff, the hostess, the bartender at Copper Blues, the person seating us, and then our waiter - they each had something different to say!  I think the outcome of everything we learned was that you can go order drinks yourself at Copper Blues and bring them in, but it doesn't count towards your 2 drink minimum - and maybe if your waiter is in a good mood (ours wasn't) they will get you drinks from Copper Blues.   The venue was CRAMPED! The theater was maybe 40% filled but we still had to sit elbow to elbow with people we did not know. They chairs are uncomfortable and I was playing footsie all night with some woman I did not know.   In addition to the ticket price, you will have to purchase two overpriced drinks.  My iced tea with refills was $10. $10!!! For boring, plain iced tea that took 15 minutes to refill!! For $10 iced tea I would expect it to be made out of some rare tea leaves that were picked by princesses.  My darling darling date ordered a $6 can of beer. The drink minimum wouldn't be so bad if you could get drinks from Copper Blues (as they have a wonderful selection!) but at Stand Up Live you are stuck with things like Coors, Miller, Corona and a can from San Tan. Whoop de do.   And then they have the nerve to add a tip on to the bill!  So, to recap: 1 iced tea + 2 cans of beer = $27.50

A yummy gourmet pizza joint near downtown without a 2 hour wait!  Humble Pie has a decent selection of fancy pizzas and one pizza is most certainly large enough for two people to share.  The menu clearly states that they don't want you to substitute any ingredients...which is a little annoying for a vegetarian.  The cream of the crop at this place is their french fries - they come piled high and are flavored with garlic, lemon, cheese and red pepper flakes...oh man.  I can't believe I ate the whole thing.  We had great service here, and my water-loving boyfriend never had an empty glass - seriously, he drinks so much water. So, I just wanted to give the server and bus boy props for that!    For the people who were fans of The Living Room (who was the previous occupant in this building), there is a little menu of "Living Room Favorites" that they will still serve you.  I didn't order anything from it, but I thought that was a nice added extra.

What a great addition to downtown Phoenix!! Now, I have yet to see a show here but if it is anything like their bar then it is sure to be fantastic.    Exposed brick, an old piano, large windows, metal tables and dim lighting provide for an enjoyable bar experience.  There are large doors that separate the venue side from the bar area.  Their strawberry cocktail (Rest Stop)  is one of my favorites drinks ever - its the right amount of flavor and alcohol without the over abundance of sugar, like most strawberry cocktails have.   The Mexican food here can hold its own and is way more than just "bar food!"

The long awaited, much anticipated CenPho brother to Green is HERE!   While this isn't another Green location (don't worry! they will open soon!), Nami serves a huge menu of their delicious tsoynamis and a variety of other baked goods.  This little cafe is all vegan, and while my vegetarian diet allows me to overindulge in regular ice cream -  these tsoynamis could convert me. I had a flufflernutter (note: NOT a sexual term, but instead a mixture of peanut butter and marshmallow cream) tsoynami that was heavenly and huge. YUM!  I did not try any coffee but am very excited to. They offer soy, almond and rice milk - with promises to add more nut varieties soon. Nami offers a beautiful selection of pastries - cupcakes, whoopie pies, cookies.  The staff here was amazingly friendly and welcoming.  I felt like they genuinely cared about my business, as well as any comments or suggestions that we had.      I am glad that I get to be the first review, since I was their FIRST customer. This vegan-niche is much needed in Central Phoenix and I am so stoked for what Nami and Green will bring to it!

Nacho, nacho maaan, I want to be a nacho (wo)man!  Especially here.    The nachos at this joint are seriously delicious.  I've been here on multiple occasions and their vegetarian nachos never let me down. I do wish they had more than one veg option - but at least they do that one dish so well. Whole garlic cloves! Melty cheese! Guacamole! Chop sticks! Don't let the initial sticker shot deter you, there are enough nachos for two people to nosh on all night long.    The ambiance needs quite a bit of work - but that can be fixed by taking your plate of nachos over to Lost Leaf or Jobot.

This is the story of The Great Food Truck Clusterfuck.  The Food Truck Festival welcomed us with a hot dirt lot filled with thousands of people standing in zig-zaggy Disney Land-esque lines with maybe 20 - 25 food trucks.  The promotions for this event stated "over 30" trucks would be there, but I guess that doesn't matter since you wouldn't be able to try all of them anyhow.  Each line was 50+ people deep and took 20 - 30 minutes of standing in one to get a bite size sample.   You had to stand in THREE lines to get a beer. One for ID check. One for wristband. One for beer.   For some reason, children were admitted for free - this created a mess of strollers trying to push through lines and unattended children running around, bumping in to people.   The Mister and I were here for 2 hours and tried itty bitty samples from four trucks.  I was so disappointed and frustrated in this event that I asked for a refund.  I was presently surprised that that process was very painless, basically no questions asked. The staff and cooks were all very friendly and did a great job, even though they were all in way over their heads.   I understand that this is their first time putting on this event and they will sure have plenty to learn for the following years. I want to support this, and if I hear about changes being made I will certainly try it again next year.

It feels kind of wrong giving Chipotle the same amount of stars that I gave Posh.   But its so delicious!  Chipotle is a great, quick meal without the heavy greasy feeling of fast food.  Their black beans, rice and tortillas are all vegetarian-friendly and their burritos can easily be made vegan without the sour cream and cheese. It is kind of a crap shoot how large your burrito will be - sometimes you get a lot, sometimes you get a little...but the flavor is always consistent.   This location gets super crowded between 11:30-1:30 with lines that can stretch out the door.  I always order online - it is really easy and you get to walk right in and pick it up without waiting in that awful line!

"Hey suga, want some sugar? How about some powdered sugar? And maybe some syrup?" - My waffles.   I ordered the nutty waffles, which are described as coming with toasted almonds, candied walnuts and my choice of syrup/honey. The candied walnuts were nowhere to be found - instead my waffle was covered with regular walnuts, a mound of white grain sugar, some scliced almonds and also a pile of powdered sugar. My teeth fell out looking at it.  I literally dummped these bad boys upside down to dust off all the sugar and then carefully place my naked walnuts on top.   I hope no one eats this for breakfast.

Is this a brewery or a Cocos?? I was so confused walking in to this place. The ambiance is horribly lacking and I could not get it off my mind.  Aside from some Nimbus posters on the wall and a piece of copper brew equipment in the corner (by the fireplace) you would have thunk this was whatever mediocre North Scottsdale restaurant lived here before.   The service was very odd - our dear young waiter's only experience with beer is probably from high school parties. My beer-nerd boyfriend tried to talk to him about beer several times and was met with an "uh huh..." and a quick exit each time. This is a brewery! This is where beer-nerds are supposed to go! Oh, he was also brought the wrong beer. And it took for-ev-er to receive drinks/food/check.

What a fantastic concept and a much needed mini mart on Rosey Row!  The Bodega boasts a variety of convience store items - ramen noodles, pet supples, a few cleaning agents, ketchup, etc.  But they also offer plenty of items that you would never find a Circle K - locally made ice cream, hula hoops, A BULK SECTION, fresh produce. The prices are very fair and comparable to what you would find at any grocery store.   I am very excited for Bodega and hope that the community supports it.  They are keeping a big chalkboard list on what customers are asking for and you are invited to a put a check mark next to items you agree with. The owners have a lot of big ideas (a kitchen, a bike shop, an art shop) and I hope they don't get lost amongst all their great plans.

Blue Hound blew my mind!  I know it has been said 100 times, but this really IS what downtown needs. No more chains or mediocre hotel restaurants - but a classy, unique downtown destination with an honest to goodness "mixologist" running the bar.    They offer a decent sized happy hour menu featuring about 6 of their cocktails at 6 bucks a pop, $3 beers, and $6 flatbreads,. I had a smashing good time with my Summer Smashes and enjoyed tastes of all the well crafted cocktails my friends ordered.  We were even given an ice bucket for a can of beer (classy! Like I said!). The flatbread was so flavorful and rich, even though it was a bit on the small size.  Our waiter, Zack, handled our large party very well and didn't bat an eye when we asked for separate checks.   Nicely split sections with a lounge, bar, and restaurant Blue Hound can host a variety of different moods and a cocktail for every occasion!

I was very impressed with this new Fuego!  I can't say that I care much for their location at the Esplanade - but since this new location is close to home and work, I had to give it a try and am glad I did!  It is a full service restaurant and Fuego does a much better job with the space than the previous tenant ever did. It is still small but they fit about 10 tables in without making you squeeze next to strangers, there is also a decent patio for those lovely summer nights.  The veggie tacos were fantastic and come with a flavorful chipotle cream sauce, they reminded me of the Ticoz tacos, before they went downhill. They have several vegetarian options on the menu in addition to the tacos.   Fuego is on a pricey side for the downtown business lunch crowd, around $10 a plate.  I wish they had smaller lunch specials in the $7 range.

Huh.  So this was the first time I have ever seen a server quit right there on the spot.  Not because anyone was being noticeably rude or demanding, but probably because for some reason he was the only waiter/busboy/host working on a FIRST FRIDAY.  I'd be stressed out too. But I'm glad that happened at the end of our meal, even though he apparently took our cash payment (no change given) with him.   At least the food was tasty enough!  I very much enjoyed the No Whey Jose Nachos - the spice level was excellent and hot.  The tacos (as I read somewhere else) do taste quite similar to the Jack in The Box tacos but are about 8x the price. I probably would have enjoyed the food a little more if I could see it.     This restaurant needs to find its identity - it has way too many cheap club elements (neon lights, overly loud music, dry ice bowls), mixed with some Indian-esque art, vintage mirrors, and then serves up pricey vegan Mexican street food.   Basically, for the price - I expect more.  I would like good atmosphere, good service, computer programs that can calculate tax, and the ability see/hear my dining partner.

I did it! After 25 long, tense years...I got my first ever massage! And it was fantastic!! I'm going to be one of those people who leaves work early to get massages now.  A very big thanks to Rachel, the new masseuse at Mood Swings, who was gentle with me during my first time.   Without Yelp's fantastic spa night - I would have never experienced such magical bliss! I also have to mention how attentive and friendly Mood Swing's general manager is! A big thanks to him as well!    I had a lovely time meeting other Yelpers in this intimate setting and getting know them as more than a thumbnail pic and a name! There were manicures, facials, aromatherapy, makeup lessons, there were also appetizers and champagne and goodie bags for everyone!   I am already a huge Aveda fan, but have never used their makeup so it was nice getting familiar with that and being able to take home  a full size lip gloss!

Sochu is so delicious, so posh, sooo...not Phoenix.  But its a welcome change! The interior is swanky with bright white and pink with dimly lit lights with fabulous textures everywhere. Don't judge it by the exterior or location. I felt like I was in LA or London.  The restaurant is separated from the bar area, where you can find well crafted cocktails and (my weakness) a reverse happy hour!   The food reminded me of an old favorite, Fate, with perfectly cooked tofu and a plentiful vegetarian selection.  My coworkers and I dined happily on their reasonably priced lunch menu while Mr. Johnny Chu came around to chat and get feedback - he also sent us back to work with menus and said that if we are rushed on lunch break, we are welcome to call in our orders so our food can be waiting when we arrived. Nice touch!   I want to try more on the menu and can't wait to be back!

I have been back to Angel's Trumpet quite a few times since my original visit and they continue to improve!! The waitstaff has been very helpful and friendly, and although they (understandly) can't speak with authority about all of their beers, they were always willing to get me one of the owners - who are beer gurus - to answer my questions.  I finally got to try a sour/wild beer on tap!!   The weather is so nice this time of year, and I love it when they have their big garage door open - which also helps the sound level quite a bit.   The homemade poptart is a fantastic, fluffly, baked puffed pastry with delicious filling and cream cheese frosting - think a gormet toaster strudle.  The ketchup is very interesting since it is made in-house and its nice to actually taste that tomato flavor.  I NEED to try their fluffernutter (peanut butter + marshmall fluff) next.

The hot chocolate at Scratch in Scottsdale is to die for - so, I have been not so patiently waiting for Scratch to open up a mile from my house.  I went on their soft opening to order my beloved hot chocolate and they said they didn't have the chocolate ganache at that location yet but to try back in a few days.  Okay, no worries, it was their SOFT opening. I understood and went back to eagerly waiting.   About 2 - 3 weeks after my original visit, I went back to finally get some of this Parisian hot chocolate!  We sat down outside and ordered french fries, a latte for my man, and my hot chocolate.  The latte came.  The water came.  The fries came.  The hot chocolate never came - now, I was being patient because I know this takes about 5 - 10 minutes to make at their Scottsdale location.  When I inquired with the waiter, it was obvious he had forgotten it and came back 5 minutes later explaining the CAFE did not serve the hot chocolate - but the PASTRY SHOP did.  The pastry shop downtown was not open yet and no one in the CAFE knew how to make it.  Then why the hell (pardon my French) is hot chocolate listed on 2 different menus for the cafe?!   I felt like the whole visit was a waste because we would not have ordered the watered-down latte or fries if we were informed about hot chocolate at the beginning - after all, we were really only there for that.   I'm about to give up on this place and fly to Paris.  EDIT (04/04):  I was walking the dog around the neighborhood and noticed the PASTRY SHOP was open.  I asked for a hot chocolate.  And, get this, no one there knew how to the work the machine to make it. Ahhhhh!!!
