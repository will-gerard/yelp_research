Wonderful atmosphere, wonderful menu, wonderful prices. It never disappoints. Of course it helps that the owners are an absolute joy. Even though it such a drive for me, it's totally worth it every time!! Definitely a jewel.

Just stopped by this little gem on the way home for the first time. I must say I like it already! Didn't want to get coffee this late so instead opted for a strawberry smoothie. Prices are okay, drink's a little too sweet but the people are pretty kind and service was hella fast (granted it wasn't busy at all, but still). Will come back to try out coffee next time and see if they can win me over!

The place is decorated nicely. It has potential. Staff is kind, but this is a restaurant. A business. Kind is not going to make people come back if the rice is dry, the chicken is just alright, server makes mistakes on the order, they never refill the water, and the food takes an hour to come out.   I took my mother here because it looked like a hole in the wall and hole-in-the-walls are usually good. We were wrong. (My mother had to share my food because her order took so long, we had to ask for it to go)  Not coming back.

Location is alright, seeing that it's right across from the light rail but the place is beautiful. Set up is nice with the fireplace outside but that's about it. The food was such a disappointment. I had the steak and not only was it a bit dry, but it was surrounded in a pool of vomit sauce. My friend and I decided to give them one more shot and ordered dessert. It took nearly 25 minutes for our dessert to come out.   To top it off, food is unnecessarily overpriced. Never going back.
