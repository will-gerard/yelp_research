This is THE place to go for a custom cake! Baby shower cakes, first birthday cakes, insane wedding cakes, everything you can think of! Any type of pie, cake combo (pistacio or strawberry mousse have to be my favorites), cheesecakes (prickly pear, snickers, margarita, etc). Also a walk in bakery now, you can get muffins, crossants, cupcakes, fruit tarts, lamon tarts, brownies, 12+ different kinds of petit fours (aka petit sweets), giant eclairs, berry crostatas, doughnuts, tea bread, tea, coffee, or even a 6 inch tiramisu, strawberry bavarian, or chocolate mousse cake. Only uses quality ingredients & fresh fruit. AND everything is made fresh daily!

This place is a regular pit stop for me! Almost anything you get here is good. Chili fries are a must try, also their eggless rolls are yummy! The mongolian with mock chicken, and the green burger are some of my favorites.  Oh and they have good vegan icecream!

I don't know if I'm reeeally allowed to review this because we didn't actually order anything. But, I'll give you the rundown. It was Valentines day, or AZ Statehood day. We arrived after discovering Pizzeria Bianco had a 4-5 hour wait. We called LGO ahead and asked if they were very busy and they said they weren't. Once we arrived we were seated immediately and decided what we wanted and waited. And waited... It was 20 minutes late, and a couple that had just been seated had a waiter immediately. That's when we knew they forgot us, I'm sure the pizza would have been good, but I think customer service is a huge deal so we got outta there! On they way home we decided to order Hungry Howie's instead. Oh well, we were ready to spend $40 on pizza but $20 tasted better anyway.  So, zero stars for being ignored!

This place is amazing! Everything is organic, the whole place is done up "green" and the food is just good. My favorite is the greek caesar! It's like a mountain of salad! And the hummus with crusty bread is always consistently good. I've tried a few of their pastries, they're pretty good, and really cute.  I definitely recommend this place as a good lunch spot.

This is my spot. It's dark, they have great beer, live music 365 days a year, and it's walking distance. I want nothing more!

This is my favorite ahwatukee Restraunt! It's damn good.   I've been coming here since I was a kid, and I've never even tried any of their plates! I only ever get a b-fast burro, #12 with guac! Their salsa is fantastic, I could eat it with a spoon!  (and I have...)  Dfinately give this place a try! Mmm!

This place is cute, but that's about it! Everything is made from cake mixes, nothing is from scratch, not even the frosting! Ew. You're better off going to safeways bakery than here to be honest.  It's overpriced & poor quality, boring tastes and really they only have cakes.. I'm a pastry chef, so I like to think I know what I'm talking about! ;]

Gotta love a good panang curry! I think I'll try the massaman next time and update. :]  Watch out the medium is hot! Same as the thai basil a few streets over.

Pretty bad experience. The service is lacking, good luck getting what you ordered!  All that healthy food must be rotting their brains!

Kind of like an over-priced, over-packed goodwill. Except, the customer service is worse here. :/  I hate leaving bad reviews but the workers here just don't seem to want to work, or help, or even bother to be very friendly.  I used my Groupon so now I don't have to go back...

This place is great! I moved right down the street, and I thought it looked pretty weird at first. But, we went here and tried it and I'm in looove.  Everything I've had here is really, really good. And such good prices.  I think I need to get in here on a taco tuesday!
