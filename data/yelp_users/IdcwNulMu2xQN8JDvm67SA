Wow- I honestly cannot believe what happened to me at this place. I purchased 2 bikes and 2 locks about 3 weeks earlier, and the gentleman who helped me then was great. About 2 weeks later, one of the tumblers in the lock fell apart. I took the lock back in, with the receipt, and the owner (?) basically said that the lock must have been tampered with, and he wouldn't let me exchange a $20 lock after spending over $800.....really? He was basically calling me a liar, and when I tried to explain that it would be good customer service to exchange the crappy lock, he stepped up really close in my face, and said "don't tell me about customer service!" Wow! Obviously someone needs to tell him because he hasn't got a clue. He could not have handled the situation worse than he did. There are so many great bike shops in Phoenix that thankfully I will never have to support those thugs ever again. I would suggest that, unless you like buying defective merchandise with no exchanges allowed, to avoid this place and support local establishments who actually care about their customers.

Ok, I just do not get this place. At all. Packed with traveling insurance brokers, horny 30 somethings, and desperate housewife wanna be's, the scene is kinda terrifying. The bar was ok, except we had these meat head types breathing down our necks behind us because they couldn't sit at the bar and were obviously bent out of shape about it. When the hostess finally came to get us,  she told me I wouldn't be seated in the dining room unless I removed my hat. Is that a promise or a threat? When we were finally seated, the waiter was snooty. Snooty! Why?? You work in a glorified TGI Friday!!   The food could have been outstanding (it wasn't) and it really wouldn't have mattered. There's so many better places to eat in this town.

It's all about the chicken fried steak- for breakfast, of course, because that is the only meal for chicken fried steak, and this is most definitely the best chicken fried steak in Arizona. Period. Forget Texaz Grill- that place sucks in comparison. Being a bonafide Okie with a serious white trash pedigree, I know good fried trashy food when I eats it. Oh and the crotchety 'Flo' like waitresses are a big bonus.

Sea Saw is a tease, and I mean that in the most flattering way. Everything we ate was outstanding (extra kudos to the soft shell crab sandwich) but when that miniscule taste of heaven is gone, and the plate whisked away, over and over and over again, you are left feeling hot and bothered and definitely wanting more.   This is seriously good food given in *seriously* small doses. When I realized our plates were about to stop coming out, I felt like a junkie trying to figure out where I could score some more cash to keep the whole thing going a little longer.

Great place! The Chirashi was awesome, as was all the sushi we tried (5 stars for actually having Chirashi on the menu). Definitely one of the best sushi joints in town.

Terrible food. Pretentious service. Stale bread brought to table. Mole was grainy and tasteless. On the upside, great tequila selection! At least you can get loaded and pretend the dinner you just waited too long for and paid too much for was worth it.

Wow, after reading the other reviews, I am now wondering if I just caught them on a bad day. Hmm....  The space is odd, even for Vegas, and I don't mean in a typically odd Vegas way either. It feels like a hospital cafe, or an airport cafe, or a junior college cafe, or anywhere that isn't known for food that happens to have a cafe. A very odd, sterile atmosphere indeed.  Didn't care for it one bit.  Our server was very luke warm, much like the coffee. He did bring me new coffee after I said something, but it was obvious we were irritating him by being there. I guess the feeling was mutual. I had the turkey hash which had zero flavor or texture, save for the fact that the potato chunks were totally undercooked and very 'al dente'. I wasn't a fan. I doused the whole thing with tobasco to make it edible. My other half had the blueberry pancakes and liked them, although they were so tiny you had to rub your eyes and look again to make sure they were still there on the plate. Come on guys, this is the '00's! Healthy doesn't have to mean tiny or flavorless.   Honestly though, who goes to Vegas to eat healthy?? We should have known better (actually we had a coupon). This place is better left to the health nuts and anorexics.

I have had good and bad experiences at Hana in the past, and overall, I like their sashimi choices, but last night was the final straw. The wait staff is very hit and miss, with most being fun and friendly but a few being the typical 'cooler than thou' hipster wanna-be types that seem to plague Central Phoenix restaurants these days.   I can overlook the BYOB (which honestly I find annoying in a sushi/Japanese restaurant since I love an ice cold martini with raw fish) and the sometimes attitudey service, and even the ho-hum rolls offered (nothing special, really). But what I cannot overlook is the ridiculously overpriced items and the blatant overcharging. My partner and I were going to order the oysters, and when we were told it was $9 for 2 oysters we politely declined with more than a bit of amusement. 2 oysters, really? Durants, which has amazingly fresh oysters, presented incredibly, and is one of the priciest restaurants in the area charges $13 for a half dozen- in a far better atmosphere.   Ok, so then I order the Chirashi bowl, which apparently is not on the menu but they will do it anyway. I always get the Chirashi as it is my favorite item at sushi restaurants, and Hana does a very nice one indeed- for $35!!! Of course you don't know this until AFTER you get the check since it's not listed anywhere. I understand that I ordered it and I should have asked, but honestly I have ordered this a hundred times from SF to LA to NY (and even at HANA before!!) and have NEVER seen it more than about $20-22. Locally, it goes for $19 at Stingray, and $17 at Sakana (which btw is much better).   Anyway, I have never in my life complained about food prices before so it is a little weird having to write this, but I truly feel Hana is fleecing people and since they were the only game in the area for a long time, they think they can get away with it.  We'll see what happens now with Stingray opening up nearby, and Moira downtown, along with a few other newbies scheduled for openings in 2010. Competition is a great thing!   Some advice for sushi lovers: it's a bit of a drive, but Sakana is still hands down the best sushi in town- with a full bar and dinner for two in the $50 range, including drinks.

In a city seriously lacking in good barbeque joints, this one made me laugh, cry, and get homesick all at the same time. Awsome rib tips, fried okra as good as my grandmother makes, and brisket that melts in your mouth. The sauce is spicy and sweet, the way it should be, and the sweet tea will send you into a diabetic coma, so be prepared.  The place is a dive (as it should be) so don't go expecting the Ritz.

It's actually called 'La Piccola Cucina' and it is wonderful! They have awesome food, set up like a deli, or you can order a panini. The food is very fresh, and they also have fantastic gelato- the only gelato counter I know of in DT Phoenix.   The atmosphere is so cool. It feels like a mediterranean sidewalk cafe - umbrellas, fountains, flowers, etc. They are barely open a month, so the hours will be expanding. I know they are closed on Monday and they close all other nights at 8pm, but the owner plans to stay open until midnight in the coming months. The only downside right now is no beer or wine, but the owner is working on that too.

We wandered in here shortly after checking into our room, and were immediately impressed with the space. It's modern yet calming, mature but not stuffy. Its a trendyish yet grown-up place, which is a welcome change in Vegas. Very '007 meets Charlie Chan' feel.  I very much enjoyed the food, which is a variety of different Asian styles. We only had a few items and they were all excellent- the dumplings, the shrimp fried rice, and seafood and noodles in spicy coconut broth. They have a solid wine/sake list, and my Martini was huge and delicious. The service was thorough if just a bit forced, but they left me alone to eat the messy noodle soup thing in peace.   I will eat here again, definitely.

Don't go here- it's terrible!!.........  OK, in all honesty, I've been putting off writing a review on Tuck Shop because I love it so much and fear that I may never be able to get a table once the word gets out.   That said, I have been here 4 times already and it's been outstanding every time. John the manager is awesome, as are all the servers. The place is cozy and inviting- it kind of feels like a swanky ski lodge with mod furniture where all your friends hang out. The menu is split up into starters, small plates and larger entree-sized items which are suitable for sharing, but you certainly don't have to. Some of my favs are the fish and chips, the chorizo stuffed dates, the fried chicken and cheese waffles, and the anchovy-stuffed potatoes. They also sometimes have a Bananas Foster dessert that is to die for. Very unique and fresh menu.  For the atmosphere, quality and variety of food, the prices are reasonable, and they have an eclectic and reasonably priced drink menu as well. Combine all this with the fact that I can walk here from my house pretty much ensures a long standing love affair.

So disappointed! It was actually a bit of a joke. First of all, they made us wait for 20 minutes on the sidewalk before allowing us in, blaming fire codes. It was 9:30, and when we entered there were 25 people tops inside. It felt sad and empty. The thrift store decor is tired, and the ridiculously bright fluorescent tube lighting did nothing for the ambience except expose the DIY on a budget design job. Then we went to the "bar". The bartender informed us they only made the 6 or 7 cocktails listed on the wall. We tried 4 of them- all poorly made and sickeningly sweet, or way too smoky. She also copped an attitude when I asked if they could make other cocktails, like maybe one that didn't taste like jacked up Hawaiian Punch thrown over a camp fire. She also had to read her cheat sheet to make the few drinks they offered, so clearly not a professional bartender, and when the drinks are $10-12 a pop- I don't think so. The basement "speakeasy" has been a trend for a few years now, with some really great spots popping up around the country, but this sad version just doesn't cut it. I (generously) gave them 2 stars because I liked the music.
