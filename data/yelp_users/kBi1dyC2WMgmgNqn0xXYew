This is one of the nicest properties in the Phoenix area without question.  The entire area is well maintained and truly gives you the sense of being away from the noise and business of everyday life.  Both the guest rooms and common areas are visually pleasing and decorated in a way that blends in with the surroundings.  The food and service are quite good and for a relaxing long weekend, you would be hard pressed to find a better option.  For those with Diamond status, the lounge is definitely one of the better ones and they will go above and beyond to ensure you have a great time.

Outback has a funny way of making a dish that should be relatively healthy and ruining it.  Don't get me wrong - the flavors are often tasty, but if you are trying to watch what you eat, this is not the place.  My understanding is that they use a garlic-butter sauce for cooking just about everything, which really ruins the healthy aspect of many of the dishes.  If you ask for it to be excluded, it will go a long way towards keeping your meal reasonable.  For a fast casual eatery, Outback is fine.  But if you really want a great steak, there are so many other places to go that won't cost you all that more for much better taste and quality.

Pleasantly surprised here to say the least.  My local classmates brought me here since it was near our campus and when I saw sushi in a strip mall in the middle of the Arizona desert, I was skeptical.  But this place was the real deal on the inside and beyond offering standard fare, presented a number of interesting specials that really got my attention.  Lobster and Miso soup, soft-shell crab, spicy tuna handrolls and real, fresh wasabi made this place stand out.  I would go so far as to call it a sushi oasis in the desert!

Outside of the novelty of slot machines in the terminal, LAS is really not all that impressive.  Entering and exiting is fair enough with one of the larger taxi queues, but the interior security lines are a nightmare.  Because this is a tourist town, just like Orlando, security is a real bottle neck here and you have to take a shuttle train to your terminal afterwards which just adds to the time.  In general, it is clean, bright and modern, but far from one of the better airports in the US.

The location along the canal with the open doors and courtyard of sorts is aesthetically pleasing.  The menu is mostly tilted toward Mediterranean cuisine with some more American standbys mixed in as a back up for those less adventurous.  Overall, the quality was quite good and the service prompt and professional.  This place falls into the "after work, wine and a light bite" category.  The layout is conducive to social interaction, so bringing a group of 6-8 is definitely feasible.  I would go back.

Thunderbird does one thing, and it does it extremely well.  Since 1946, it has served as the pre-eminent international graduate level business school in the US.  Consistently ranked #1 in the world, Thunderbird goes beyond the technical aspects of a business education and attracts those personalities who possess global curiosity.  By focusing on the intangibles, Thunderbird consistently sets itself apart by educating cohorts of students able to adapt and excel in all corners of the globe.  As a veteran, their motto definitely resonates with me: "Borders frequented by trade seldom require soldiers."

Surprisingly good Indian food in the middle of the desert!  We went with a group and while the service was a tad slow for an empty restaurant, the portions and flavors did not disappoint.  The location is a bit hidden in a strip mall, but don't let that deter you.  I personally enjoyed the variety of the naan they offered and will be back.

One of the things in life you can count on, no matter where you go, is an Irish pub.  And O'Sullivan's keeps the promise of plentiful beer choices, hearty pub fare, and Irish mainstays like corned beef.  Combined with good prices and plenty of TVs, they have consistently delivered a good lunch experience.

The Pub serves as the focal point for all out of classroom gathering.  The building, a historic tower for the airfield from a bygone era, was recently remodeled and is a very modern and clean space.  With both indoor and outdoor seating, it is the perfect place to get together with new friends, enjoy typical bar food, a beer and a game on one of the flat screens.  For those that stay on campus, this is a terrific venue as it ensures a quick commute and plenty of interesting people to talk to.  In this neighborhood, it would be tough to do much better.

I use the Inn for weekends in conjunction with the EMBA program and in that regard, it delivers a great product.  The rooms, frankly, remind me of the BOQs from the Army - small, plain rooms for officers who were in transit.  Clean and modern, they offer the added bonus of access to the study rooms upstairs which are critical to collaborating with your classmates.  The price is reasonable and the staff is very accommodating - if you have any reason to spend the night in the area, especially for Thunderbird business, you would be hard-pressed to find a better location.

This place was a hidden surprise, in a good way.  Tucked way back in a strip mall (isn't that always the case?) it offered a counter ordered meal with server delivered food.  Nothing fancy, but more full-plate style tex-mex beyond the typical burritos and tacos at places like Chipotle.  The portions were huge and they get bonus points for self-serve salsa and pico de gallo with a nice variety of flavors and levels of heat.

Very impressive for an airport oasis.  The bar is spacious with a number of interesting brews on tap.  The menu is eclectic with many of items fresh and home made.  The atmosphere is anything but your typical hard plastic airport food court.  I typically spend some time here waiting for my friends who are traveling in from other places and I almost forget I am in an airport!  The only knock is the typical airport price bump, but that is going to exist for any establishment in the terminal, so I can't blame the restaurant too much.  Keep in mind it is before security which has its own pros and cons, but I highly recommend it either way.
