I just purchased my 3rd car from Acura of Tempe and I plan to do my 4th with them. I truly appreciate the professional treatment, and friendly environment at Acura of Tempe.   Each time I have made a purchase I was assisted by Luis Sofre, he is always very helpful and I now he works hard to get me the best offer. Without hesitation he is willing to assist, let me test drive and works with me on getting the deal done. I highly recommend this sales associate.   The sales manager, Gregg Meisenzahl was very accommodating. He really made me feel like the business was appreciated, and appreciated him willingness to work with me and make sure I was completely satisfied.

I'm not sure this new company has its priorities straight. Went here to apply for a loan and they didn't acknowledge the substantial relationship and saving which more than covered the loan. The way they submitted the loan was false which caused the decline on purpose. I don't believe my friend and I will not do any business with them. There place was very nice, manager was friendly and professional even if she lacks trust of her own long standing customers. All positive reviews seem to be the last company, not this one.

A truly unique space in the heart of Phoenix! Very few cities have a piece of their original town site intact. This park features numerous historic buildings which sit on their original foundation, as such, it's like visiting Phoenix in the early 1900's.   While visiting the Square you must visit the anchor, The Rosson House Museum. This is the home that started it all. Built for a family of 7 in 1895, it took only 6 months to construct, but at the hefty price of $7,500.00! (Which was a boat load of cash back then)  The Rosson House has been meticulously restored to its former glory. It took the community more than 6 years to restore the house at a cost of $750,000 not including donated time and materials.  Come see this Gem in the heart of the city, enjoy the food venues and take in the aesthetic charms all around you. They also encourage you to make a day of it and visit the neighbors, the Science Center and the Children's Museum just across the street!
