Not good experience.  They scrape off not only the gel but your fingernail too and they don't care about your business!

This business is not near my home, but I make the journey.  They do a great job and the owner is especially talented in getting stains out that I was not able to remove myself.  When I have a favorite item that is stained, rather than throw it out, I take it there first.  Sometimes they can't get the stains out, but for the times they can and the low cost, it is so worth it.

I have heard great things about this vet, so I have over the years attempted to call her.  At least two times, my calls were never returned another time it took a week.  I could not rely on her care if my dog was ill.  Although she comes up as a Phoenix vet, she works outside of the city as well.

This is the best place to find large, gooey, fresh dates! It is hard to get out of the door without a spinach pie or baklava.

So far so good.  I am a new client, changed from another Allstate agent.  Hector went above and beyond to review and take action on my driver's policy and it saved me money I have been paying needlessly for years!  I recommend him and his staff.
