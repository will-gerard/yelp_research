The food was pretty good and was about what I'd expect from a steakhouse but the view is amazing and the atmosphere was really cool.

Great customer service, they had the best price, and surprisingly did the job the same day! If I ever need glass work done again in the future I will definitely be using them again. I recommend this company to friends and family.

I was referred to Forzano's by a friend of mine and I have to say working with them has been an absolute pleasure and their craftsmanship is exceptional. Every single employee I've come in contact with has been extremely helpful, friendly, and really took the time to listen to what it was I was trying to accomplish.   I've done business with a few other furniture restoration companies in the past and I've learned This is not an easy business, unforeseen issues can arise, parts or small pieces may need to be ordered, basically it's not always a speedy process. Forzano's however finished the work on my furniture earlier then what was initially estimated, this was very much welcomed compared to the other companies I've dealt with  in this field of work.

I needed some mirror and glass work done for a house I was remodeling and got quite a few bids from other companies and was disappointed by either the pricing or the service I was receiving. However not only was this company the cheapest quote I received the gentlemen was very professional. He was 15 minutes early calling before hand to see if it was OK if he was early. The other companies I was dealing with came off as if they were hurting for business and were trying very hard to get me to move forward right away after giving me a bid. However ACME came out and did there measurements, gave me a quote, and when I told them I wanted to check around with a couple more places he was very courteous and gave me his card and assured me that they do there best to have competitive pricing and to give him a call if I needed further assistance. After checking with a total of 5 places not only were they cheaper then the competition by over $150 they were a pleasure to deal with. Next time I will not worry about getting other quotes and wouldn't use another company. I suppose this is what has kept them in business for over 40 years.

Used them again for a new shower enclosure and it turned out beautifully. Very nice people who where very respectful of my home seemed to have a solid focus on customer satisfaction.

I have been a customer of this establishme however over a decade and have always thought it was some of the best food in town. Over the past year approxamitly I've seen a steady decline in there customer service  and it pains me to say I am close to never going here again. There food as i mentioned is never the problem, they have a great menu and everyhing on it is excellent.   Over the past year I've noticed it has slowly become harder and harder to place my orders over the phone due to long hold periods (5-10minutes). I tried staying mindful of how busy this place can be, assuming they'd get to me ASAP. This doesn't happen every time but enough to say it happens all to often. Up until recently I ordered take out 3 times a week. Over the past month 3 times in a row on seperate occasions I have call down there and was immediately placed on hold, which I don't mind as long as im promptly attended to as soon as possible but these were extremely long holds where I'd give up after 10 to 15 minutes. Naturally someone on hold can be forgotten by mistake from time to time, it happens. I've done it by accident myself, I wouldnt hold it against them if this happened every now and then on occasion. However lately it hasn't been out of the ordinary to be on hold for 5-10 minutes before being attended to, sometimes holding for quite some time then being hung up on. Last night I was placed on hold and waited 12 minutes trying to be patient and assuming they were busy. I hung up and thought I'd just called back 30 minutes later. This time the phone rang over and over and I couldn't get an answer. Me and my wife were set on having there food so we decided to wait another 15 minutes and call back. Once again we were instantly put on hold, I tried to get a word in to let them know I'd been waiting for 45min to put in an order, hoping they would at least assure me I would be attended to in a reasonable amount of time, but he didn't wait for me to say I was willing to hold he mechanically asked then immediately put me on hold. Once again I waited on hold for 8 minutes before I gave up. It is very disappointing, before this place became very popular the customer service was excellent and now it seems some of there workers have an attitude as if you are lucky to be eat there. I do however want to make it clear this review is a testament to the service I've received NOT the quality of the food. Pita Jungle over the past decade I've ate their food has progressively gotten better from what started already started as some of the best food in town. That in which has been what keeps me going back, but I will not continue to if I keep having such a hard time placing an order. When you place an order your hungry, having to hold and debate hanging up and calling back is too much of an irritation to deAl with when I'm ready to eat. Perhaps an online ordering system might be a good option for them if the incoming calls hard too hard to manage.

This place is a perfect model for retail customer service, It's hands down the best supplement/vitamin shop you will ever find in the area. When you walk into a GNC or a Hi-health store you will typically find 1 employee running the store who is usually behind the desk reading a book or magazine who if you're lucky might greet you when you walk in the door. The best is when you have an 65 yr old lady attempting to talk to you about working out and Creatine supplements. Not to mention all these other retail stores are much more expensive!!  This place is a breath of fresh air for anyone who purchases supplements and doesn't always have the time to research product before coming in. I consider myself knowledgeable when it comes to health supplements but this guys really really know what they are talking about!!! You can tell they take pride in what they do and will have no problem answering your questions and giving you there full attention.  Best part is there smoothie selection, its amazing and has something for you no matter what type of diet your on from Mass Gainers, Low Carb, Meal Replacements amongst others I've not not tried while having the typical add in that other place offer(ginseng, multi-vitamin, energy boost).  Hats off to the owner for what he's created here! As someone has mentioned previously, he typically buys his product off Amazon which is great, however these people supply me with the best customer service, the most up to date product information, and having no problem stopping what they are doing as soon as I walk into the store to assist me. They have earned my business for life and I will supportgood local businesses, I have no problem spending a few extra dollars to do so.

I called over the phone to to set up a pick up order of Chips and Salsa and requested the price over the phone then repeated the amount to the lady on the phone for verification to assure I went down there with enough cash for the food and tip based on what she quoted  me. I don't quite remember what I paid when I picked up the last order but the price she gave me was very close and the amount sounded correct. I went to the bar to pick up my order and the bartender made it very apparent I was an annoyance to him by his body language and the way he approached me rudely asking "Did you need help? I couldn't tell because you seem to be just watching TV?". I was shocked by his response because I was just trying to be patient while he finished what he was doing and was attempting to be courteous. I told him I was there for pick up and gave my name. When he picked the ticket off the food he told me I owed literally twice as much as what I was quoted. After I explained what I was quoted he told me "You must have gotten confused" which in my opinion is pretty hard to do when you are only calling in an order of chips and salsa. I explained that I double verified the price so I would know if I needed to stop at an ATM for extra cash before hand. At this point the bartenders attitude began to change even more for the worst as he attempted to scold me about being more clear when I call over the phone and next time I order just know what the price is no matter what the person says on the phone!!! I then asked to speak with the manager still being able to keep my cool. He then shook his head and laughed quietly as he walked to the back mocking me. The manager backed his employee not even listening or addressing what might have caused the confusion and simply reduced the price and walked away without wanting much interaction with me as it appeared him and the bartender where friends. However I know the GM was not in that day (I have seen him before when we ate there previously) and I'd like to the the situation would have been handled much more professionally if he were there. But after 10 years of personal management experience I can assure others this situation was handled horribly and the owner/GM really need to look at the quality of people they are employing.

I have used GYMO twice and they really went out of there way to make things easy. I think I speak for just about everyone when I say moving is one of the most miserable ways to spend a weekend. It's stressful, time consuming, the constant fear of something being broken, having to call and inconvenience friends and family for help, and if you are like me your body is sore for a week afterwards. GYMO relived all those negative aspect that go along with moving as soon as I contacted them.  I am a guy who typically doesn't like hiring other people if it is something I can do on my own but after my experience with GYMO I won't consider renting a truck and doing it myself ever again. Once you see how efficient and safely they move your belongings it becomes apparent this is a job that should be left to professionals.   I highly recommended GYMO.

What a cool place!  I've been lucky enough to eat here a couple of times and haven't been let down on any aspect of my dining experience. The House at Secret Garden is a true gem in the Phoenix area that has an at home feel to it that is very unique.   The last time I was there I was in a group of 4, we all ordered different items from the menu and everything was amazing including the presentation and the service. This is one of the only restaurant I would recommenced to anyone.
