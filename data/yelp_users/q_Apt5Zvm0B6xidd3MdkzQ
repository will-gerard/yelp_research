The owners are super nice and the food is awesome. I am addicted to their BBQ pork and rice noodle dish. It is one my favorite places to eat and I look forward to it every time

Food is good, still their service lacks, took an hour to get food, no apology, no explanation and there was maybe 4 other tables of people

Fricken awesome.  I love their spring rolls and their chicken phone is the best.  The people are warm and friendly and the food is made fresh
