If you want an authentic old fashioned ice cream soda fountain, you found it.  Any ice cream item is worth trying, the food is pretty good but can't compare to the outstanding sundaes and sodas.  It's also a nice touch to see the servers dress up in authentic 30s and 40s attire.

Phenomenal! I had the occasion to go last night and although I have been going here for over 10 years, this is the first time I thought to write a yelp review for them.  The food is absolutely worth every penny and the side dishes were perfection as well.  I seem to always order more sides than needed but I still managed to eat everything.

Had lunch here a couple of days ago.  We arrived a few minutes after 12 on a Wednesday and it was a morgue.  The staff was sitting around watching tv and I felt like we interrupted them.  It's an ok place and I guess my beef with this place is that it's like amateur hour.  I get the feeling that they opened this place with no prior restaurant knowledge just that someone liked their chicken parm and were told they ought to open a restaurant.  That's a great start and probably how many mom and pop places start but it is clear that they need some restaurateur guidance.  The food chicken parm was decent but my friend said that their sausage peppers tasted like it was made the day before.  Another reviewer described the decor as being in their grandparents house.  That's spot on.

The alarm battery on my house was going bad and I looked up several online which offered about the same price but where going to charge me $10 for shipping.  They had the battery in stock so it was much more convenient.

The wings are awesome, I'll give them that.  But it's in a bad location and reminds you that bar in movies where something is about to go down.  My advice, get the wings to go and get out while the getting is good.

The Date Milkshake from Sphinx Ranch is hands down the best milkshake I have ever had. Absolutely the best!  I was very curious about their date milkshakes after reading other reviews so I decided to try one.   I ordered a medium shake (a little pricey at $4) since I wasn't sure if I would like it.  As they made my shake, I browsed the store which has a nice selection of locally grown fruits and nuts for gifts which looked very appetizing but I didn't buy anything else.  After I got the shake I had second thoughts about a date milkshake.  I mean a milkshake made of dates... not the first thing that comes to mind and I have never been at a place that even had them on the menu so how good could it be?  It's mind blowing.  As I was driving away I really wanted to turn around and get another. Next time I will definitely get a large one.  It's a little hard to spot this place from Scottsdale road as it is right by a U-Haul store but before the turn for Drinkwater.

This place really should get 5 stars but it doesn't even deserve 1.  Why?  Well for starters unless you go there when it opens it pretty dirty with napkins and bits of food on the floor and on the seats. No excuse for this.  Secondly, the bathrooms are ALWAYS disgusting.  Honestly I don't know how it passes inspection with the bathrooms alone.  It is a great location and the ice cream is pretty damn good. Nothing fancy. It's old school ice cream, and for that it's fantastic.  The non-ice cream items (burgers, sandwiches, etc) should be avoided. Just get the ice cream.  Finally, like others have said the owners (not so much the staff) are on the rude side.  I have seen customers get yelled at because they asked for their table or chair to wiped down.  Maybe over the years they have become jaded seeing the countless number of drunks coming in here and acting like they own the place.  I can tell you that when he was yelling at the customer above she was very polite and it was in the mid-afternoon. I hope that someday this place gets bought by someone who loves customers and much as many people love this place out of nostalgia. For the past several years this place has lost its sparkle and I really would like to see it return to its former glory.

The one star is just because I felt I was being "sold to" more than caring for a patient.  I felt she was more interested in selling me on products and other treatments than my overall health.  I had a question about how often I should use the cream she gave me to try and when I called to ask about it the person who answered the phone was really put off by me calling.

This is a very cool place and I love it here.  As others have said, it's been around "forever" (I think it started in 1988 hence the name) and has kept up the with the times nicely. Still a classy place to get a martini or a gourmet burger.  It's hip without being pretentious.  The fact that he has survived over the years in Scottsdale where trends change monthly speaks volumes.

The food is  pretty good, but I would suggest you get it to go for two reasons:  1) the place is a dump. It's the kind of dump that I think the owners actually think it's fancy and classy. Their is a chiropractor a couple of doors away that would make a more inviting restaurant.   2) They made me feel like I was interrupting their business. The owner or manager was sitting at a table with a pile of bills yelling about how they charge too little and the bills are too high.   Like I said the food is good but with these other things going on in the front of the house, it makes me wonder what is going on in the back.   Perhaps two stars is a little rough but with all the other glowing reviews of the place I expected a lot more.

Friendly with large selection. A bit cleaner than other hardware stores but their appliance selection isn't as complete as the other major hardware store.  The tool selection is nice and they have a wide variety of stuff from the cheap to professional grade.

It seems the best days are behind D&B.  The games are now 70% games of chance that dispense tickets like you would see at a Chucke E Cheese.  The other 30% are primarily racing type games and all of the games we played were clean and in good working order.  I was put off by all of the ticket dispensing games and wanted to see way more arcade games.  They only had 3 machines that were 80s classic.  It's very loud in here but that's typical of any places like this.  As for the food... not so good.  I ordered a half rack of ribs and a good portion of it was very fatty.  The garlic mashed potatoes were good but the onion strings or whatever they were tasted very bland.  The service was good tho and our server was attentive to drink refills and checked on us very often.

Nice old school corner pizzeria.  These are a a dime a dozen in NY but in Phoenix, it's a special treat.  Can be very warm to eat here in the summer and there's not much in the way of seating so if you visit in the summer months, I would take it to go.

Something is very weird about this location.  I have been going here on and off for the past three years but over the last 6 months or so it has steadily gone down hill.  The food is still great, I'll give them that.  Not consistent in terms of spiciness but I actually take that as a good sign that my food is being prepared fresh and not just from a pre-made bag of prepared food.  The main problem I have is the management here.   Service has always been good but the managers seem to get a kick out of berating and harassing the servers which ruins  the meal for me.  The manager would stand next to our server and tell her that we needed drink refills.  This was about 5 seconds after she said "I'll be right back with some refills."  Later when she came by she asked if she could put our leftovers in some take home containers... seconds later the manager yelled at her to get us some to-go containers. Creepy and harassing and not the first time I have seen it.  A table next to us joked "what's with the bouncer?" Just not a relaxing atmosphere to enjoy your food anymore. Please send your managers to a restaurant etiquette class!

Delicious tuna subs. It's a change of pace from the subways of the world and the people are friendly. Very clean and nice roomy seating.

This place is impressive looking but  for daycare the price is a little ridiculous. The main reason I am only giving it 2 stars is that I feel tha I am constantly being sold to here.  The almost make you feel guilty about not having a grooming done on an overnight visit.   We selected this location because it is somewhat near the airport and we had read other nice reviews.  It's not a bad place it's just that they never let you forget that this is a business.

Best. Ribs. Ever. Seriously, it's hard to find fall of the bone tasty ribs in Phoenix but somehow this is the place for them.  My server was Tonya and she was very attentive and kept our drinks refilled and checked on us throughout our meal.  The decor is simple but comfortable and overall has a great vibe to it.  I can't wait to go back.

Very nice place with authentic Mediterranean food.  The food is served on real plates (not in plastics baskets or paper plates) and I think that's a nice touch and better for the environment.  The owners are very charming and will offer samples if you are unsure about what to order.

The good news is they moved to across the street this week, if they hadn't I couldn't have given them 4 stars since the old place had serious AC problems. July isn't the time you want to have AC problems.  The new place is a lot better and the food is good if you are looking for nothing fancy but good ol' American food. I had the Philly Cheesesteak and it was awesome.

One of the better burger places around. The staff is friendly and if it's your first time there, they take the time to show you the ropes.  Not that you really need ropes shown to you since they're making burgers not launching satellites into orbit, but that still makes it a bit more fun.

I have seen this place before as it's near a coffee shop that I go to quite often (it has a life-size Centurion outside of it that catches your attention) so when I saw it featured on groupon, I thought it would be a great time to finally try it out.  BIG MISTAKE!!!  I don't know if they have had bad experiences with coupon sites but they REALLY make it known that they would not like your business if you have purchased a discount online.  There's also a sign on the door to remind you that any discounts you might have are not really welcome here.  Ok, I'll forget about my $15 voucher if it takes an act of congress to use it, I'll just pay full price so I can eat here without going through all the red tape. Many fellow Yelpers love this place so I'll give it shot. Y-U-C-K.  The first thing I noticed with the smell of grease. Strike two, Centurion. Let's have a look at the menu. Whoa. A little sticker shock, but what the heck it's gotta be good.  It's not. I tried the fish stew and it did not taste fresh at all. Ok, maybe the España Pizza will be good.  The Chorizo was nice and spicy but the Manchego tasted off-- way off and was not sweet tasting at all.  The Brunch menu does look pretty good and if I were to ever go back it would be to try that.

Nice place to get work done when you're out. All the drinks are good. One star deduction because the counter help runs hot and cold.  Sometimes the service is great, other times they are more interested in talking to each other.

Do not go here if you are somewhat in a hurry during breakfast.  Even with only a few customers here, things get slow really fast. If you can live with slow service or it's after breakfast you might want to give the food a try.  They have some interesting selections that are fun to try.  I had the PB & C (Peanut Butter, Banana, and Cranberry) and my friend had the stuffed french toast.  Both were pretty good.  But Gwen, if it was pretty good, why the 2 stars? Good question. First, the coffee is nothing special and tasted slightly burnt.  For a coffee house, I expect much better.  Secondly, I went back about three weeks later because it was a good meeting spot and I wanted to have the stuffed french toast to myself.  It tasted nothing like the first time I had it.  Not that it was bad because it wasn't bad... it just wasn't anything like what I tried the first time I was here.  I had to call my other friend just to make sure I didn't order the wrong thing. Nope. It was the stuffed french toast with caramelized bananas alright... just tasted WAY different.  So for a restaurant to have the big of difference just a few short weeks later the lost a star.  The Good: Interesting menu Pretty good food Nice decor  The Bad Slow service if it's even slightly busy Coffee is not good at all Inconsistency

They have the touch! My friend turned me onto this place that just opened not too long ago and I must say I will be going back!  It's hard to find someone who is strong enough to give you a deep muscle massage but gentle enough not to make you feel more tired than when you went in.

I tried this place awhile ago and wasn't impressed but I was hungry when I drove past today and went in for a second try.  I'm glad I did!  They really seem to have gotten their act together.  Real friendly staff and if you don't see a flavor you like they will definitely consider putting it on the rotation (which is one of the perks of an independent yogurt place).  One of the better fro-yo in the Valley now that they have the bugs worked out.

I love a good bbq and this place knows what they're doing.  The menu is simple but what they do is done to perfection.  The staff and owners are super friendly and made sure everything was up to snuff.  The only drawback is that they are not open much past lunch so if you're in the mood for Ric's for dinner, you're out of luck at the moment.

After reading some of the reviews you might be inclined to think that Sweet Republic is aboard the hype train. Nope. It's awesome hand crafted ice cream at its best. Make sure someone in your party orders the Campfire S'Mores Sundae -it's incredible. If you happen to be the one who is ordering it, make sure everyone else knows you're not gonna share.

Really tasty bbq. I had the pulled pork with a side of mac and cheese. The meat was tender and juicy and I topped it with the spicy bbq sauce which was great.   After reading other reviews I did not have high expectations of the sides. I really enjoyed the mac and cheese. They make it fresh when you order it, which I had not seen it done before. My friend had the beans which she did not enjoy at first but after she added some bbq sauce, it was top notch.
