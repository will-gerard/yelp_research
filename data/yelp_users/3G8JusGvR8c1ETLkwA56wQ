Requested a tow truck at 2:45pm (1445, for those familiar with 24 hr time) and advised that the mechanic closes at 5, and I needed a tow from my house to the mechanic for an issue that should have been fixed the first 4 times I took it to my service dept at my dealership, it wasn't, I found a different highly recommended mechanic, I digress.  I contact insurance to have my vehicle towed over to the mechanic.  Dispatch sends request, I get automated text message stating that tow truck will arrive by 4:14.  90 minutes.  Well, ok, I'm at home, but not working on homework so I can keep track of when the tow truck arrives.  4:20 comes and goes, still no truck.  I call dispatch and find out (after being hung up on, mind you) and the dispatch calls the driver, who says he'll be there in 15 minutes, which would put it at 4:45, and just getting the car on the truck at 5, (assuming they arrive on time) and the mechanic would already be closed.  I'm not leaving my vehicle on the street with the keys in it, even if it doesn't start.

Super friendly owner, and waitress, ah-may-zing food, will definitely come back... House was a bit empty, and service was prompt.  I cannot say enough good things about it.
