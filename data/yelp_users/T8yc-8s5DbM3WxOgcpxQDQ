Consistency, Consistency, Consistency...  As a former employee and frequent guest, it pains me to give such a mediocre review. I ordered the SEARED AHI TUNA AND HUMMUS appetizer. When it came to the table I instantly noticed a problem; No sesame seed crust. I didn't think much of it until I got a third of the way through and realized the advertised SEARED ahi was in fact WELL DONE! :( :( I paused eating and drinking until a my server came back outside.   I explained the situation and told her I didn't want a remake but would like some kind of recovery for eating a completely botched order. Not even a manager came out to talk to me.   As a former employee of another Pita Jungle, it pains me to make a comment but the fact NOTHING was done to recover my experience. I will definitely ponder which location I go to to enjoy my once favorite dish.   My server Nicole was great, I just really hope she brought my situation up to a manager or kitchen manager and it was the managers fault in not recovering my experience.  Will go back to the Scottsdale location, with caution... and next time I will have NO hesitation sending it back! Being in the industry has it's double edge sword of service and dining etiquette.
