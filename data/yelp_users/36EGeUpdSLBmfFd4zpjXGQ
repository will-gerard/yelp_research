This is beginning to become one of my spots in the Valley to shop. I can always count on finding a good deal on brand name items at this location. The stock is always on point...and they really have some cute "inspired " pieces too. This location seems to have a better selection, maybe because its the "Biltmore", but nonetheless, I love this spot, and recently put my boyfriend on to this spot too, and he seems to favor it as well!!! I always leave smiling, happy that I stopped thru.

The pizza here is solid, living in New York before, I have a reference point.  I love the oil that drips down in the middle of the pizza when it's folded...Yummmmmm! That's surely the money maker and that's why I keep coming back. Service is always on point, you can always expect a smile, and greeting each time you come here. Everyone seems like they like their job here. The house salad is pretty basic,  but when you add the homemade Balsamic dressing, it is soo good. I have not tried anything else on the menu,  but I am certainly open and anticipating. Will Def go back, and if you love good pizza...then this is your spot. They do have other locations in the valley,  so check it out

I found this place on accident, and I am so glad I did.  My daughter and I was able to walk right in and we were taken care of right away.  The staff was very nice and attentive. My nails were done with precision, and you can tell they take pride in what they do and value the customer. I will definitely go back!

Great barbershop, great location, great ambiance!  Ian, my barber, always take care of me and cuts my hair with precision. I wear my hair ultra short, and I can't take any chances with my hair,  so finding this spot was a blessing. My barber gets me in and out, and that's very important to me.

I was desperate for Chinese today and I found a spot that delivered,  so I was super amped. I have never tried this spot before, so I was a little apprehensive,  but nonetheless,  I went for it. The lady who took my order was pleasant and the food came to us very fast, but as soon as I opened the door to receive my food,  I got a whiff of a strange smell. Not the wonderful smell of good quality Chinese,   but some straight gutter,  low quality ish. I opened the bag and the smell of old grease and burnt food hit my nostrils. I order veggie fried rice,  veggie egg rolls and fried chicken wings.  And all of it smelled old af.  I made sure I said a prayer before I ate the food.  The egg rolls tasted like cinnamon fried something, so pretty much... I was eating everything that they fried the the food in,  so basically I got a  Chinese food bonus,  everything I ordered plus the free taste of old fried desert... It's my lucky day!  The Rice had the same fried,  sweet,  dirty taste.  I threw all of it away, and the  chicken was greasy af... So greasy I could use it on the creaky  door hinges in my house, enough to shine your shoes,my shoes and even  enough grease to use on my face so I can prepare for battle and give them a straight up ass whopping for serving this disgusting food.   I abhor this place,  and so should you.

This is my go to spot when i need my juicing needs met when i am too lazy to do it on my own...lol....and the ladies at the juice bar always hook me up!! If you have an obsession with beets, like I do...try the "My Bloody Valentine"!!! It's heaven. I love this location because it's near my job  I love to people watch here being so close to ASU, and it was the first Whole Foods store in the Metro Phoenix area!!

This place is ok. Being from the south, I know what real soul food tastes like, and this is the commerical version of that. I have the opportunity to sample the chicken wings, mac and cheese, collards and yams. It was just ok. The mac and cheese was bland, the yams were decent. The fried chicken is hit or miss. Once my chicken was finger looking good; but then it tasted reheated.  The place is always packed with a diverse customer base; which is great. I would go back to eat; but its certaintly not a place that I drool over like I do Grandma's Sunday dinner.

This place is simply amazing!! No kidding, I think I had the best meal of my life here. My boyfriend and I came here on our anniversary for drinks and dinner. We had a reservation, but got there a little early to enjoy drinks and live music in the Jade Bar (review coming soon). Promptly at 8:30, we were seated for dinner. Our waiter was super cool, forgot his name, but I do remember his warm personality.  We bonded because we all from the East Coast.   Our food came out so fast! Although the food was pricey, it was worth every penny. I had Chilean Sea Bass over forbidden rice and the Farmers Market salad.  The salad had watermelon radishes, Japanese cucumber,  pickled carrots and a ginger vinaigrette.  So good. He had Filet mignon and according to him it was the best steak of ever.   After dinner, our waiter graced us with complimentary homemade cookies.  They were a chocolate ginger combination. ...I wanted to die from the decadence. ...loved everything about it. The total bill was approx $120, but it was well worth it! Will Def be back, birthday is coming soon....mmmmm???

Proceed with caution!! I repeat, proceed with caution!! This place can get really crazy. Designer clothing, shoes and accessories for extremely low price....you know it's a madhouse full of driven men and women trying to find deals. The deals won't just drop in your lap,  you have to Dig!! But it's well worth it!!! Seriously, this is one of the only spots besides the Goodwill, where I buy all of my shoes. You can find extremely fashionable shoes for $18.99 and up.  I mean with a spot like this,  how can a girl not be put together at all times?!

Love, love, love this place. This is my favorite spot to  eat, drink and be seen. From the decor, the interesting mix of people, and the chill vibe, AZ 88 has been my date night spot consistently since  2009 and I love it more and more every year. The drinks are quite amazing to say the least. The martinis are super potent with flavor and alcohol. ..definitely worth every penny. I am obsessed with the Mai Tai as well as the Mojito.   You can tell they dont use the dreaded sour mix, it's mixed with quality ingredients.   Count on it, the drinks will take you there in no time. The food is soooo good. When i used to eat meat,  the AZ88 chicken sandwich was my ish. The food is always seasoned well, hot and just smack yo momma good. I love going to the bathroom to watch myself in the mirrors that are everywhere. It's so much to say about this place, you just have to go and see for yourself. ..your welcome! !

I stumbled upon this spot one night in Old Town with my boo after the club in need of some food....and this place was a hit! We were seated right away despite the fact that the place was packed. I ordered the chicken strips and fries and I enjoyed every bite. The food came fast and it was made to order!! The music was Top 40 , which was ok...wouldnt expect anything less...this is Scottsdale for heavens sake. I will be going back to this place!!

I really enjoy Delux!! The turkey burger is the bomb.com!!! I have yet to be disappointed. The ingredients are always fresh. The food is always hot. Customer service isnt bad either. If you are into beer...they have a fantastic selection. If you like fruity beer...try the Flight #3...its soo tasty. This will always be one of my fav spots in Phoenix....will def go back

I love this spot!!!  I had a chance to come for brunch a few Saturdays ago, and boy, did they deliver!!! We were seated right away, the service was prompt and our server, was very charming!! (I forgot his name) I had the Peach Bellini and for $4, its not shabby either!! It was refreshing and a mellow, without making me intoxicated. I sampled the french toast ala FEZ...Mmmmmm...what I can say!! It was soo good, and not to mention filling for the price!! The compote that was on the french toast complimented the crunch bread they used, 2 different textures....me mouth likey...alot!!!! I am contemplating going back, real soon, to sample more off the menu. Love this spot.....I give this spot 2 snaps up...lol

Food City is such a great place to shop for all my veggies, for cheap! I can make out with almost a cart full of fruits and veggies for approx $30!!!! I love the feeling of this place. From the "Food City" jingle playing in the store, to all of the Mexican speciality items, this place is much more than a grocery store. Its like a community. They really take care of each other. They have  a shuttle bus that transports the customers who don't drive!! I love that.  Not to mention,  the live Mariachi Band that I have seen playing in the restaurant section while you eat!! On Saturdays,  they roast Chili's on the grill, and it always smells so good!!!

I loooove this place!!! This is my go to spot for most of my shopping needs. This location always has the best selection of the current trends. I visit this location at least once a week to keep my wardrobe fresh to death. The employees all know me by name...lol..I need a job here. This place is highly recommended!!

Oh my!!! This place knocked my socks off!! I am so glad we stopped by this evening for dinner. I was aprehensive at first because it was nearly empty, but that changed as soon as we were dazzled by the amazing customer service from the staff.   My husband and I ordered drinks from their menu. He had a Moscow Mule, and it was tasty. I ordered an Old Fashioned, but it was a little to old fashioned for me...lol.. not throwing shade to the bartender, but I guess I really didn't know what I wanted. She recommended this amazing drink to replace the first one, I can't recall the name of it, but it had ginger beer and I believe it was a   Margarita of some kind. Bomb!! I am super obessed with that drink.   For dinner, hubby order The Market Burger, which was very nice on the eyes and his stomach. It was huge, a great value for the price of $11. I had the Pan Seared Salmon with sticky rice and boy choy with a balsamic reduction and mushrooms....it was damn good! Seasoned so well, and the fish was cooked to perfection! Sorry we didn't take pics, the food looked and smelled so good, it didn't have a chance.  I am not really much of a desert person, but I was so impressed, I ordered the brownie with rocky road ice cream and it was garnished with mint!! Woo chile, listen I ate all of it...super satisfied and I am a fan!! Will definitely be back sooner than later!

I have never been JCP shopper until moving to the valley. This store has always had a stuffy, untrendy rep to it, and I consider myself to be quite trendy and fashion forward....and in the past i have never had a desire to shop here. (Sorry if that sounded snobby, it just was what it was) So this 5 star rating comes as a surprise, even to me. I went for the Black Friday(Thursday night) deals and BOY did I make out with some good ish. I spent $134 and I was able to get a Men's Robe, Men's Claiborne sweater, a sweat suit for my tween daughter, boots, a bookbag purse, a watch, a necklace,  earrings, 3 pairs of fuzzy socks,  underwear, bracelet and a camo jacket!! And everything is SUPER cute!!!! I am super pleased with my purchases! JCP has stepped their game up and can compete with the other department stores...I love the fact that their is a Sephora inside too..... I was also given an additional 15% discount for waiting too long for my cashier due to her error in calculating my purchases! Excellent customer service! 5 stars and a customer for life!

Bar smith is one of those places where you go to unleash your wild side. I love to come here to dance my as off for hours at a time. I am in love with the rooftop bar and dance floor. I always get my house fix when I come, as I am a die hard Electronic music junkie. Ditch the heels and be prepared to dance all night,  if you are into House music!

I am super obsessed with this place! The food is always amazing, each and every time. I love the Sabzi...which is stewed greens. It is flavorful, the serving size is plentiful and it tastes like love. You can tell whoever cooks the food takes great care to do so. The hummus is the best I ever had in this lifetime and maybe the next. Top notch customer service! They make you feel like a 5 star customer. I highly recommend this place.

I love FE!!! This is my go to spot for almost all of my grocery needs!! I love the produce section, even though its a lil on the expensive side, but you can always find organic! I adore the premade meals too, which is so convenient for me and my fam on those nights I don't feel like cooking. Plus, its good to be able to read and understand the ingredients on the packaging!  The wine section isn't shabby either. This is the ONLY place where I will buy my Malbec....and the price is nice too. I can be finicky about my wine too so this hits the spot and tames the beast. They also sell my staples, quinoa, olive oil, nuts, coconut water, just to name a few. I am so glad this location is here to stay. ...FE is my spot and always will be.....

I love this place!! I stumbled upon SWINA one day , online. I was in desperate need of a facial, but did not want to drop alot of money to do so. I decided to give it a try. I was also impressed with the fact that they use all natural products too!! The staff is friendly, I always can get an appt right away!! An added bonus is that they are open late on Thursdays!! They are even kid friendly; I took my 10 yr old to have a facial! I am a customer for life :)

I  have been to this establishment before and i was obsessed. The pizza was solid,  and I was super amped to eat here again tonight. OMG, can you say  totally grossed out by this place. The chick who was cooking did not have a hair net on, and she was freely shaking her hair over the food. WTF! Are hair nets or even hats for line workers  a thing of the past? No gloves either.... And to top it off, she took her bare hands and touched her hair......right in front of the customers and continued doing her thing. What the hell? I am never eating here again...yuck

This spot is nice. I love to come here for drinks with my boo when we patron downtown.  The Pomegranate Julep is to die for...mmmmm. I love my bourbon, and Hannys delivers. I love the music too. Friday night is my fav! The DR spins classic hip hop and I am transformed back to the 90's....my favorite era for music. Cool spot to hang with friends,  your main squeeze or anybody that you wanna have a good time with. Will definitely be back soon!

I have been wanting to try this place out for a while now sincw we were in Scottsdale doing some thrift store shopping and we decided to check it out.   I was impressed with the clean and modern decor. I loved the open kitchen. I can be very OCD when it comes to my food so being able to see what is happening really gives me peace of mind   Anyways, we were seated immediately by the manager. He was very nice he asked if we ever been there before and he was gracious enough to go over the  flavor profiles of each dish.   what caught my eye on the menu was the grilled fish tacos! The presentation was so cute.. Was so excited to eat.. but as soon as I bit into it I thought that was a mistake.. there was no flavor, food was very Bland. The only highlight of this experience was my Margarita. so delicious, a little pricey for the size, but the flavors were better than the food. I will not be going back.

This place sucks!! I moved to the valley and have yet to find that "go to " chinese spot, sooo I decided to give this spot a try. I called my order in and was assured by the employee that all the food is cooked to order, always fresh. So I picked up my food, and what do you know, I got some old azz fried rice with some microwaved shrimp. WTF??!! I give this place 2 thumbs down and I would not eat here if I was hungry as a hostage :(

My BF and I stumbled upon Postino on the internet one date night, and boy I am so glad we did!! This place has everything...good eats, good wine and excellent customer service!! I was impressed  the moment we stepped in!  The funky decor, diverse crowd and the nice mix of tunes will put you in a mood to vibe.  Our first experience was on a Friday nite, and even though it was packed, we were able to get a seat without a lot of waiting. The Moscato was the best I have ever tasted. I make it my business to visit when I can to pick up a bottle to share with my BF.   I cant wait to check out the live reggae on Sunday!  I will keep you Yelpers posted....

This goodwill is definitely in my top 5!! I check this spot out during the evenings on weekdays since it's on the way home. There is usually a few people in there, which is great for me because I can take my time and sort through all of the goodies!! I always leave here with something fab! Although, lately the prices on certain "brand name"  labels are quite high. Maybe I should stick to the half off Saturdays, like I usually do, but I just can't resist going when the mood strikes. I recommend this spot if you are in the neighborhood

I am not impressed. The food is Uber bland and expensive for the portion sizes. I ordered the Spicy Pad Thai with crispy tofu. I was specific about it being crispy and it was super soggy. To top it off, I paid something like $10 bucks. I am not a fan

I am so disappointed. I never have any problems with this location as far as service and the quality of my food, but today, my experience was less than stellar. I usually order the lentil fatoosh salad, but today I decided to order the wood fired salmon, and boy was that a mistake. First of all, my food took forever to come, I waited 40 minutes. Once my food arrived, my salmon was not well done as requested, and the portion size was super small considering the price of $15.99. It was literally maybe 2 big tablespoons of mashed potatoes and a sprinkle of spinach. The food was Uber bland, and it wasn't made with love. Whoever is cooking in the kitchen must really hate their job because it shows in the food.  The server "tried" to fix the situation by bringing us a complementary desert and she brought us baklava after I cleared mentioned a gluten sensitivity at the beginning of our order. What in the world?!! She was kind enough to give us $10 off the next meal. I am so disappointed and I won't be back. Ever.

I can always find what I need here. The store carries a wide assortment of toys that Hank likes,  as well as rawhide and other doggie treats. The staff is always helpful, and Hank seems to like it here They always give him a treat when we bring him in. The prices are a little on the high side, in my opinion.  The only negative for me is the Banfield Hospital,  it is a rip off. You pay the month fee, and still have to come out of pocket when you bring pooch or kitty to them. Oh, and you can't cancel until the END of the contract.....

I finally had a chance to dine here and it was just ok. This definetly is not the worse and its not the best Caribbean food I have had. I like the vibe of the place..from the pics on the wall...the map of the islands..not to mention the familiar reggae tunes that were playing in the background. I had the chance to sample the Jerk Chicken, it was ok....a little dry, as if it had been sitting for a while. I will try to give a one more try, maybe I went too late in the evening..but we will see. I will update you yelpers later

Overpriced, low quality food, and a  creepy vibe. This spot is trying too hard to be health conscious and they fail horribly.   How can you be a health conscious restaurant that has "organic" all over thr menu and sell 40 to 50% maple syrup and not 100 pure maple syrup?! Get the f*** out of here.  What is the other 60% made of? High fructose corn syrup? Also,  how can you promote menu items that are gluten free when you don't even know if the items are cooked in seperate cookware from the non gluten items. I ordered the gluten free brioche french toast, it tasted more like pound cake then french toast. And the nerve of them to charge me $11 for it and to put the icing on the cake, $ . 50  for 4 sliced almonds  that look like it came out of a bag from Walmart. They charged me $5 for fresh pressed orange juice this s*** taste like it came out of a Tropicana carton! This spot can play this game with other people, but come on son, for extremely food conscious people like myself.. its just not happening. This place gets two thumbs down and a smack in the face for trying to pimp this garbage ass food.

My bf and I came here one evening to enjoy the Boom56 gathering and I must say, I really really enjoyed this low key gem!! The spicy cilantro wings BANG!!! Lol...looved them. We sat on the patio and it was cool to people watch all the local neighborhood folk. The DJ played lots of house music which gets me going!! Cant wait to go back in 2 weeks for the next Boom56 set :)

I love Spirit of Yoga! Everyone is so friendly, and it is such a truly diverse yoga community. I am taking my 200 hour YTT here and it's been an amazing, transformative experience thus far. The  public yoga classes are on point!  Take the Vinyasa class on Saturday's with Juli! She gives you the perfect combo of spirituality and exercise. I always leave her class feeling connected and challenged. Your first class is complementary!! So what are you waiting for!?

This place has literally changed my life! This is my third visit and I have seen immediate results!!  My anxiety, sleep and my blood pressure are almost back to normal.  Every time I leave here I feel so relaxed and centered. Mayo is very skilled at what she does. The insertion is not painless at all and she also has a very relaxing environment for you just to drift off and sleep and let the healing begin.

I really want to like this place; but it just does not give my that fuzzy feeling that I get when I go to other lounges in the valley.First of all...the place is small, and its croweded on Friday to the point where you cant enjoy yourself. Being able to have space to two step or people watch is impossible. Next...there is a cover after 8. C'mon son...really. Most spots in Phoenix you can get on for free. I am not cheap in any way..but this is not an exclusive club for heavens sake!! I really want to support the local African American businesses; but they always want to charge you a ridiculously high cover when I can keep it moving to Scottsdale .for free. The music is the only reason why I gave it 2 stars. I know I can hear some great tunes from the 90's , current tunes and even some reggae, which is uncommon out here. I dont know if I will be back...

I always have a good time when I come here. I don't go to people watch or even really to drink, I come for the dj on the patio. He kills it everytime, and I am so obsessed with him. He plays all of the music I grew up listening to..east coast hip hop, reggae, to name a few. I don't know his name, but I tell everyone about his skills, and people that frequent the spot, all agree....he is on point!! I will be making a trip there soon so I can!

This place gave me the runs....literally...straight to the bathroom after I ate this slop. I should have known better...My spidey senses was telling me to leave..but no, I stayed just because I've been craving, jonesing for Caribbean food. So I placed my order, I had Curry chicken, rice and peas and cabbage. I declined the plantains, it seemed the flies enjoyed it better than me. They were having a blast swarming over the plantains. I paid something like $10.95...which in my opinion was too much considering the proportions don't match the price. The taste was just ok...not the worst..but not the best either. The cabbage was pretty good though. The food seemed old too..if I had to bet $20..that food probably was cooked yesterday cause the kitchen did not look cooked in. I feel like a sucka reading these damn reviews thinking I was gonna get a good meal...I don't know where the hell these folks who left reviews ate at..it sure as hell doesn't seems like its this place. Maybe I came at the wrong time. My 1st time sucked....and my bubbling stomach thinks so too. 2 thumbs down and a wtf.

I loooooveeee this thrift store!! Its a new addition to my neighborhood. The grand opening was Friday...3/30/12. This place has many designer labels. I have never seen a selection quite like this location. It is a new store, so I pray that the selections remain plentiful. On the first day it opened, I scooped up a Kenneth Cole motorcycle jacket for $24.99, a stunning Cache beaded top for $12.99, a black lace vintage crossback maxi dress for $9.99 along with some other goodies. I can see this being one of my new fav spots to shop.

This place sucks...point blank period!!! Growing up on the East Coast; living amongst Jamaicans...I have had the opportunity to eat real Jamaican cuisine...and this is not it. The rice and peas tasted like crap.The texture was overcooked and flavorless. You cant tell me they did'nt use 10 Minute Boil a Bag rice!! The curry chicken was made with chicken breasts, not a whole chicken that gives it flavor when its cut down to the bone marrow.  The curry was bland! My curry chicken tastes wayyyyy better. The cabbage was soggy and again the common blandness. I had high hopes for this place. I feel sorry for these poor Phoenicians who think this is authentic island Yard flavor. Will never go here again.

We decided to come here to start off the evening  and have drinks in order to entertain our out of town guests.  It was so packed in the restaurant;  however they gave us the option to sit at the bar and wait for available seats. Right away, I felt a  "stank vibe"in the in the atmosphere, which I am totally not down for. But none the less I decided to give it a chance considering it could have just been my skewed perception. We did not get greeted promptly, we actually had to ask for menus and water.  After sitting about for about 10 minutes, a waiter comes over and asks what we'd like. I did have a lot of questions about the drink menu because I had only been here one other time. The waiter seemed dry, which made me feel some kind of way. So I  trusted my instincts and ordered the Tropical Margarita and it was so good.  I think it had tequila , yellow chartreuse,  basil , and  citrus. The drink made up for the lack of service but I would probably go back again for the great drink I had.

I can always count on getting a great mani/pedi here.  The techs are friendly,  which is a plus.  The facility is clean and there are so many gel Polish options.  One drawback,  I notice they don't soak the gel Polish off but they drill it off.  My nails are extremely strong and I didn't like the fact I didn't have a choice to request soaking vs "drilling" off the top layer of Polish off.  But next time I go,  I will be more assertive about that.  But all in all, great location,  great vibes. I will definitely be back!

I have been coming here since it opened last winter 2012, and this place has went down hill since. It used to be so nice, super clean and had an inviting atmosphere,  Now the machines are never clean,  nor are the bathrooms.  My daughter got sick with a fever after a recent visit. I am diligent in wiping the machines down when I am done, but this is not reciprocated. I called the corporate office.....nothing. ..go figure.  I pay my dues, so i expect for it to be clean in return. It's a shame that I have to give it only 1 star, but La Fitness is has fell off in my book...would not recommend joining at this location.

I don't understand the hype. I did not like this place one bit. It was very easy to find, and very convenient because I work down the street from this place, so this is how they got the one star. So I walked in, I was impressed because it was very quaint and clean. This usually puts me in a good mood when the area is clean. So I checked out the menu online before I came so I can get an idea of the options. I was super amped!! I adore hummus, pita and veggies,  so I felt like I was winning !! Wrong, the vegetarian bowl was this weird combination of cold, soggy and hot stuff piled on top of each other. I believe they are trying to emulate Chipotle ' s Aesthetic, sorry, not feeling it. What did it in for me is that the kale was cooked with the stems on. What a lazy move! I will not be coming here again.  Sorry

This place knocks my socks off every time I come. it is a cute Italian restaurant in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale. Perfect spot for date night at dusk on the patio with your boo,  or you can bring a group of your girls and chill at the bar. And if you're in the mood for late-night bites at around midnight, definitely check the spot out but nonetheless,  the  food is delicious, and the drinks are amazing! Last time I dined there,  I got the Risotto.. so decadent,  so delicious.  But too pricey for the small portion, but with high-quality ingredients you get what you pay for. Or I may be just greedy.  But I will definitely be back.  They have happy hour from 4 to 6, so take advantage of that.

Najette is amazing! I have only been there twice but I think I'm obsessed with her. I am a newbie in the waxing world so the thought of getting a full Brazilian it's kind of scary, but she put me at ease right away. her technique,  skill,  patience and her for perfection produces the most amazing waxing job. I was able to go 5 weeks in between a Brazilian which I've never had that experience in the past and actually I could have went another week but I didn't want to wait that long. for you to seasoned waxies out there you know what I mean.. Lol. but I love this but I'm always able to get in whenever I need an appointment and I'm definitely a customer for life.

As soon as I called in my order, I became obsessed!! The customer service was amazing. They were courteous and friendly, which mean everything to me! I was told my order would be ready in 10 minutes, I got there in 7, and my food was ready!!  The place was very clean and smelled clean, which is also a plus for me. I loved the open kitchen area, which allows an OCD person like myself to check out everything that is going on. But nonetheless, I ordered Tofu and Broccoli with garlic sauce!! It was sooooo good! Everything  was cooked perfect, especially the tofu..I love fried, firm tofu and they delivered!! The garlic sauce was good....a little sweet for my liking, but still good. And for $6.95, I was able to get leftovers popping!!! I am happy...the end

I was craving some Falafels and i decided to stop in. It was empty, which is never a good sign. But i went for it anyways. I ordered the Chicken Shwarma(for my daughter) and the Falafel platters with half rice and half salad.  My food came out pretty fast and the presentation was promising. I took my food to go and as soon as i got to the car i could not help but to dig in. Everything, i mean everything was super bland. The rice, the falafels, the hummus......#blandasfuck. The only thing that had any hint of flavor was the tzatziki sauce. I am super pissed i pay 24 dollars for some whack ass food.  I give this 2 thumbs down and some sea salt to season the food.

I am writing this review not to throw salt in anybody's game or to throw shade, but I feel like I need to let my black women know what's up in regards to our choices regarding hair salons, especially in Arizona where the pickings are slim. Warning; if you don't see another black woman working in the hair salon or you don't see another patronizing the salon, run as fast as you can! Seriously, all Stylists are not created equal!! Let me repeat, all Stylists are not created equal. The only type of white girl you want in your head is the chick who hangs out with pookie and dem and definitely my girl, Rachel dolezal. Straight up!!   I should have known better, but I wanted to try a new experience, an equal opportunity experience. Coloring all hair textures shouldn't be hard. No need for a style, just color and go!  I mean, how hard could it be to color a pinch of coarse hair?? Not a big ass afro, but a pinch of hair?!   So I wanted my hair a vibrant blue black color. I sent photos ahead of time. Michelle explained to me the pros and cons of bleaching the hair to achieve the desired result, which I appreciated since I explained to her that I was trying to grow it out . But sometimes you have to give the customer what they want.   First, she dyed my hair black and mixed blue into it. Nothing showed up. Then, she put a demi color on my hair to try to lift it slighty. While the hair was wet, it appeared to have a slight tint, but that turned out to be just the reflection of the water in my hair from the lighting. I found that out real quick as soon as this kinky hair dried up. I paid $75 for the same color I had when I left.  I reached back out to her because nothing showed up. I told her that i wanted to do whatever it took to get the desired results, especially since i spent $90($75, and still left a tip to be nice). She agreed to fix it the next day. So she starts to lift my hair, and I notice she didn't put me under the dryer. My hair has been lifted to gold blonde in the past, and the Stylist put me under the dryer. I didn't say anything because she is the professional, and I trusted that she knew what she was doing. She left it on for about 30 minutes and then she washed it out. She showed me what it looked like, it wasn't lifted evenly, it was 3 different colors, lighter in some areas and darker in others.I didn't think anything of it, because again, I gave her the benefit of the doubt because this is her expertise But I hindsight, that made all of the difference.  When  she added the color and rinsed, we finally saw a little progress...under the artifical light. I was happy!!  I couldn't wait to go stunt and show off my hair. I dropped another $10 for a total of $100!!   I walk outside And my daughter says, "mommy, your hair is green and blue. Wtf!!  I didnt ask for mermaid hair. She took these photos of my hair so I could see, and I was mortified!! My hair looks like someone scribbled with a green and blue crayon in the lower part of my hair and the top is black with some speckling of color.   I am super disappointed! My shit is dry af, itchy, and damaged because of this mishap. I spent $100 and I look like a fool. I give this place 2 thumbs down and a black girl starter kit hair tutorial!

I was super excited to know that we were getting this newest addition to our neighborhood as the food choices have been very scarce. But in any event, we decided to try the new restaurant for dinner last night. As soon as we walked in I noticed the mayhem. It was so many people doing so many things at once and not enough people sticking to one task in order to make everything flow smoothly.  I was hesitant to order I was really craving wings .We got 16 piece family pack meal which included three sides,  8 biscuits.  I specifically asked for 8 wings, 4 breasts and rest could be mix of dark meat. We waited for about 20 minutes to get our food. We got home , and what do you know..we had a box full of old thighs, no other pieces. My biscuits were missing too. I was so pissed. I had to drive back to the restaurant. I tried to keep my composure as  as best as possible considering that we had dropped like 33 dollars on this meal, but when I told them what happened they had the nerve to tell me all we were out of chicken thats why you got what you got. What the hell???!!! This was a bad move. My response was why didn't you just tell me and give me the option to wait?! So nonetheless, I had to wait another 15 minutes for my food. I made sure i checked it before I left.  I got all my chicken fresh , three new sides... my biscuits finally and also apple pies. I don't recommend this spot at all. I was not the only customer that experienced this nightmare there was three other people that same night that had the same problem that I did.

I didn't even know this place existed!!I'm so bad because it's right in my neighborhood. But none nonetheless, I am so impressed with this place. Always super clean,  friendly employees and a great selection.  Since discovering this place, I come here frequently. I'm always able to find a very unique pieces for my already fabulous wardrobe and even items for my teen daughter. Adding this spot to my top 5 list.....Goodwill never disappoints!!!
