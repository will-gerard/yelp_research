We just left Texaz, and I just had a write a review because the experience was so amazing!  We were with a big party of 13 people ranging in ages from 3 to 40.  The owner came by and played trivia with all of the kids at the table and gave out prizes for the right answers. How often does something like that happen?    Service - Our service was top notch!  We each ordered several courses and our server was always on top of drink refills, each order was correct, and we had to ask for nothing as she anticipated what each of us would need.  She was quiet but very thoughtful.  Food - Giant - Texas size portions, great tasting and very reasonably priced, considering our group was mostly teenagers what more could you ask for?  The chicken fried steak is amazing!!!  DÃ©cor/ambience - lots and lots of things on the wall and an infinite amount of Texas kitsch.  I would recommend Texaz for lunch or dinner any day of the week.  It was a great experience and the food was outstanding!

This  is the 2nd vehicle I have purchased from Land Rover and it's because of the excellent level of customer service they provide.  Actually, it's because our salesman, Jon Parske is awesome!  He's great to work with and hope if you're in the market for a car that you go see him!!!

I LOVE cake!  I love cupcakes!  It's really difficult for me to give this place 2 stars because I want so badly to like it.  I have visited this place a total of 5 times, and each time the owners are so rude.  Most of the time they don't have all of the cupcake flavors they should have for that day, so it's not unusual to choose from a mere 3 flavors.  I would say their cupcakes are average tasting, but they look pretty.  As business owners you would think that they would be significantly more helpful and pleasant to their customers.   Every time I have been there they are either on the phone and couldn't be bothered by my presence or act like they would rather be doing something/anything else.  My thought is that they should hire someone pleasant to deal the actual "selling" part of their business.

We have been to NOCA a few times and it's going downhill in food quality.  The service has been a bit underwhelming but the food has been small but good.  I have always enjoyed the changing menu featuring in-season vegetables which is the only reason why we go back.    We went the weekend after Thanksgiving and they must have been playing with their B-team (or maybe their C-team) because our server was really unpleasant.  She made use feel like she had much better things to do and was really short in her responses to questions.  I chose the soup entree (per our servers recommendation), and I am amazed that they would actually charge $17 for a cup (literal measuring size of portion) of soup with pieces of squash.   My husband ordered the steak, which he has ordered before, and this time the portion was significantly smaller and was way overcooked.  Before dessert they usually bring cotton candy...not to our table.  Everyone else was getting a little fluff ball on their table, but apparently when you are stuck with the snooty server she's to busy to bring it to the table.   I felt much better about our experience when upon walking out we overheard 2 different tables complaining about their food, at least it wasn't just our experience.
