I was referred to see Dr Hales to have a root canal retreated as well as another tooth that also needed bleaching. When you walk in to their office, the staff is all friendly and presentable and actually talk to you while you are waiting. It's a very comfortable environment and with not knowing what to expect I was a little nervous. The assistant who was taking care of me was very mindful of my comfort, talkative, and kept the appointment going instead of letting me sit and wonder what was happening next.   Dr Hales is a very nice doctor and his chair side manner is very professional. He lets you know what he's doing the entire procedure and even sings to you too. I would definitely recommend SSE to anyone who needs to see an endodontist.

In need of a new glass window next to our front door... had left a message on their answering machine on a Thursday and they did not respond until the following Tuesday. The representative did apologize for not calling sooner, but I still felt as though my business didn't matter.

I joined Mountainside gym in 2013 and have been pleased ever since! I haven't ever had any experience with the personal trainers at either the Chandler or Gilbert location but all of the employees on the floor and at the front desk are very presentable and friendly.   The kids area is amazing. My son absolutely loves going there, they keep it fairly clean and even host "Parents Night Out" events on Saturday nights. Soooo great!   I am always able to find what I'm looking for on the floor, as far as weights and they have a great abundance of cardio equipment. I'm really happy they even have ropes and TrX for you to use!!   Great gym, always clean, they always provide towels and make ordering from their cafe super easy by enabling you to charge to your account.

I have had several spray tans over the years and NO ONE has been as pleasant and awesome as Bronzed Bella!!   My tan is always on point, never runs or becomes splotchy and lasts a good 7-10 days. I never look orange and always have a good "glow".   She comes to you, in the privacy of your own home and it's never awkward. She's very reasonably priced and offers packages for larger parties.

Had a gel manicure and pedicure yesterday and was very impressed! I told Kenny exactly what I wanted and he did just that, my nails look awesome. They did not burn my feet, hurt or cut my hands and the atmosphere was really nice. They have several pedicure stations as well as nail stations and it was very clean. (I love that they have the disposable liners for the pedicures). I will be going back!!

Our sidelight window next to our front entry was broken... I had called several companies and they were the only one that called me back in a timely matter. I did notice too, that others that I called were directly linked under the same company (different company name, same coordinating rep). I spoke to them on June 1 about having my window done by them, was a reasonable price and their installers and reps seemed to be nice and helpful. On the date that my window was supposed to be delivered, no one was returning my calls. It took them two days to finally call me back and then tell me that they had to reorder the window as it was done incorrectly. I was patient. Because, it's an expensive window and yes, I'd like it done correctly. When the next installation date came, I got a call AGAIN that it was incorrect and they'd have to push out my installation yet, again. By this time I was starting to get very annoyed and started calling other companies to come out and replace our window. Yesterday, they called and said they got my window in and that it was the "correct way now" and they could install it so I agreed.   The installation tech is super nice and friendly, and did a great job installing, I assume? However, I am still not happy with how the window looks in the frame and he basically pointed out that I have to "deal with it" and "that's just how it's going to look" and even then proceeded to point out something on an older window saying "It doesn't look any worse that that...." Hmmmm. By this time I am FURIOUS with this company and their accommodating. They did give us a discount but I felt like it was comparable to giving a waitress a $2 tip. For what we put up with them, and then now what we have to look at every day and "deal with it", I felt they should have discounted the installation at least something more affordable. I will NOT ever use them and I WILL tell every one of my friends and family to make sure NOT to call them for any glass or window repairs. (as well as the other 4-5 companies they run).

LOVE this location and all of their juices!!! My favorite, go-to is the Greenie, with ice and add ginger.   Their customer service service at this location is awesome too! Yesterday our office, placed and order to pick up and even though they typically require you to place the order on line, I didn't want to have my credit card info saved so they allowed me to call it in. We had 11 drinks total and when I arrived to pick them up they had them ready and packaged up so I could get them back to the office without spilling.   Excellent customer service, fast, friendly and everything is fresh & delicious!

I am so pleased EVERYTIME my husband and I eat here. Last Sunday evening we even took our 4 year old son with us and they were very accommodating and all of their employees are happy and seem to enjoy being at work.   My favorite is the green chili cheese fries and the chicken sandwhich. It's perfect every time. For my birthday they gave me the chocolate mousse cake and it's to die for!!!

Wasn't sure what to expect at first, there was no menu posted and it was a place I'd never heard of before.   I ordered the classic which had cheddar cheese, thousand island and pickled onions and cucumbers in it... It was fantastic! All of thier burgers come with two parties which I thought for sure would be too much but it wasn't at all.   My husband had the burger with poblano pepper and smoked mozzarella (?) and pick de gallo; only abs he really enjoyed his too!   Our service was excellent and to be a quick as expected for baseball stadium and a freshly made burger.   We will definitely go back next time we head to the stadium!

Our office typically orders in on Fridays and we do either breakfast or brunch... Last Friday we tried out Snooze for the first time and had a wonderful experience!   From the moment the phone was answered the customer service was done extremely well. She (I wish I remembered her name) was extremely attentive, helpful and asked appropriate questions. Our order was large, about 10 breakfasts and she was kind of enough to take down our names and be attentive to certain food allergies I listed off.   Upon picking up the order, again, greeted by excellent customer service and impeccable friendliness. She confirmed the orders and made sure to point out the allergies.   Food was delicious as it could be after the 10 minute drive back to the office, we WILL be ordering from here again. Prices are very comparable and overall very pleasing.
