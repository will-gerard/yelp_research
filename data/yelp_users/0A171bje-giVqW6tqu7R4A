I used to shop at Dillard's all the time... But NO LONGER! They have changed their policy on returns, I bought a pair of shorts back in July 2015 and they sat unworn until October when I went to return them they would only give me a gift card! Their policy is 30 days! Well we have been out of town and traveling and was not able to get back to the store in thirty days. I had to take a gift card. Then I decided to spend my gift card and had to pay an extra 20.00 on the thing I got. It did not fit right so I took it back the next day.  At the  register, I could only get a gift card back on entire purchase, they sent me to costumer service to get my 20.00 back and my original gift card which was great but why did I have to go to costumer service for the return!? What happened to costumer service at the register!? And why do stores like Victoria Secrets have a 90 day policy & Macy's & Nordstrom have a receipt policy! What happened to you Dillard's? I miss the old days when you were a lot more friendlier & costumer oriented. I will go back and spend  my gift card but no longer will you be my place...

Macaroons are great, the one I had today was a little over filled but still great flavor! I was however extremely disappointed... I ordered the Greek Caesar with chicken - the chicken add was 2.95 for deli slices chicken. The atmosphere has a great feel but they need to turn the a/c on...

I am so in love with place! The hummus is so creamy! All lunch entr√©es are amazing, and baklava is out of this world! I'm from the west side of town and WOULD drive here once a week just to eat! Yummmmmm Atmosphere is relaxing and the owner is very personable! Two thumbs way up!

The food was good - like I remembered Chinese food to be... Before I became so used to American Chinese. The lunch special was filling, the service was good & the place was clean, even the bathrooms. I would eat there again.

I remember when you didn't have to pay for carry on & refreshments... What happened to customer service! The stewardess looks like she just rolled out of bed & not very friendly. I guess you get what you pay for.  Even the guys loading bags were just tossing bags around, I get it it's their job but never seen any that were completely haphazard.

I will give this place 2 stars & that's because I feel bad for the server. She did a pretty good job and was friendly. From there everything was horrible, the food was spilt by another server trying to help. And each dinner was brought every 3-5 min apart and our family didn't even get to eat together. One of the steaks were so bloody... Pretty much inedible. The manager walked by us several times and did not even offer an apology. Save your money!

1st time I went here the food was so good. Was super excited to go back... That was about 3 months ago and there food was cold and not what you see in the pictures. I figured they were having an off day. So today took my brother there today and the food was cold, I got the Kobe burger, the cheese was not melted and had like 4-5 mushrooms on it. I think I am over paying 15.50 for a cold burger that leaves you wanting something better! Service was friendly but the cooking was crappy! No more chances.

The food was mediocre & service was friendly.  - onion rings, excellent.  - pancakes, good.  - panini, ok - eggs came out & whites were beyond running had to be sent back.  - omelette, was so so.  - food presentation was great!  - Tabasco was watered down.  - latte needed more caffeine.  All in all it was ok nothing to rave about, this place would not survive near downtown but trendy places are pretty rare in the west valley. Has comfortable atmosphere..

I'm giving this place two stars because I liked the costumer service! The guy was extra friendly. The burger was one that could have been thrown together at home & did not fit the bun & the fries were only so so the ketchup was running and tasted funny.

Ok... Read all the reviews & still decided to eat here. Glad I did. Don't drink the water, it's tap. Service was friendly & on spot! I love eating at nice places, usually downtown... This place had a great atmosphere the food is above par. I ordered  the scallops & my husband ordered the ribs. He was not a fan of the sauce... It's not traditional BBQ sauce & he is more a meat guy. The scallops had great flavor but order a side salad, there are no greens serviced with dish. We will be back.
