Quick review ...   The place Definitely has a hipster/yuppie vibe to it.  Hidden in a neighborhood.  Half kitschy junk for sale and half restaurant.  Service was friendly and prompt.  The food Stopped in with the kiddos so we only got coffee and a cookie, both were great.  The draw is the food for sure.  The bottom line I like the energy and vibe that they have, but it comes at quite a price in that the noise factor is off the charts.

I've been to the Liberty Market twice now and had great experiences both times.  The first trip, my wife and I just went in for coffee - and unfortunately we had already eaten dinner and dessert.  I had a cappuccino which did not disappoint, and required no augmentation - and my wife got her usual decaf americano with splenda and milk.  The desserts we saw looked fantastic - and apparently we were there for one of Joe's friend's birthday and they had these fantastic looking cupcakes (how did I know?!)  Second trip was with my brother, mom, and step-dad for dinner.  I ordered the farmer sandwich (veggies + goat cheese) which was delicious, and a perfect size.  Not too large, not too small.  Bro ordered the sloppy joe extra spicy - it was good, but not knock your socks off.  Mom and step-dad ordered pizza (1/2 cheese, 1/2 pep), I tried a small piece, it had a great sauce, fresh cheese, and a crisp + chewy crust.  They also split a mixed greens salad which looked fantastic.  We ordered dessert which was a granola bar (awesome), brownie (great reports, but alas, no walnuts for this nut), and I got a slice of pumpkin-apple bread to go (eventually tried this at home and was yummy).  The decor is really nifty - there is an open kitchen that runs almost the entire indoor portion of the restaurant.  There is a wood-fired pizza oven and it looks like a prep-kitchen in the back.  The drinking glasses are actually glass, and all of the tables are nice dark wood with very comfortable chairs.  I over-heard Joe talking to another table about not advertising just yet to make sure that all of the kinks are worked out.  He also mentioned later when I was ordering coffee that the cupcakes were a special event dessert and might not be a regular item.  The entire staff is incredibley friendly and made the experience that much better.  It's too bad that Gail W. had such a bad experience - and also too bad that there is no real detail in the review.  Give it a try - you won't be disappointed.

The Place: I'm not sure if the first review was before they opened the new restaurant ... there is indoor seating in a beautiful casita-like dining room.  The entrance is through an archway that leads to a small patio area, off to the right (still outside) it looks like they could host a band or dance floor.  The style of the restaurant is what I would call "quick casual" in that you order at a counter that is kind of hidden around the corner, then the waiters will bring chips and salsa as well as the food you have ordered.  The food: I have been three times and can say it is an easy place to recommend to others.  The chips are fresh and crispy (a fav of the kids) and the salsa has a little heat, but nothing too over bearing.  I have tried the grilled chicken and grilled steak in burritos (the names escape me).  These meats are really well seasoned and served with pico de gallo which is fresh with a bit of heat.  My wife tried the beef tacos, also delicious.  The kids love the quesadilla and beans (they dip the q in the beans.)  The bottom line: Great environment (if a bit "out there"), good value, great food.  It's worth a trip for sure.

Place:  kitschy, not here for ambiance, although it was a neat little country diner-ish type place.  Seems that many people riding motorcycles also frequented this place.  If there were such a thing I think I'd call it a biker breakfast boutique ... LOL.  Food:  The breakfast was certainly one of the best that we encountered on our journey.  The omelet was indeed huge and all the ingredients were fresh and delicious.  The pancakes were also very large and fluffy, tasty treats.  Even the waffle was good, crispy on the outside, tender in the middle.  Bottom line: Can't go wrong here - great food, great service.  Only thing slightly lacking might be the ambiance, but seriously, it's breakfast ... shut up and eat.

The place: Located in the Paris Casino & Hotel facing the strip, this sidewalk cafe was busy, but not overwhelming.  Our server was a bit frazzled, but was apologetic and once he was on task, it was great service.  The food: My wife ordered the breakfast crepe - wow. Carmelized sugar, thinly stacked delicate crepes, and a boat of fresh whipped cream.  I ordered a breakfast omelet which was delicious, but standard for an omelet.  The highlight of my meal was the bread and preserves.  The coffee was fine and plentiful all in all a great meal.  Bottom line: If you're in Las Vegas and tired of buffets give these guys a try.

Lee's is an odd place. It's a sandwich shoppe + ice cream shoppe + bakery + coffee shoppe ...   As a vegan I tried the veggie sandwich sans mayo and it was pretty tasty. I thought there was supposed to be tofu in it, but it was missing, so I'm not sure if I ordered wrong.  The flavors were great - so unique compared to the standard American stuff. The bread had a great crust and chew.  The only knock is the cash-only register. Uh, this is 2014 and you do operate in a strip mall. I could see a food truck being cash only - but a large operation like Lee's? Come on now kids ... must ... take ... plastico!!

The place The place was loud, but what restaurant isn't these days. If the goal is to distract from the mediocre service and food, it didn't work. It really wasn't that bad, however we seemed to have a problem with our chairs sliding around on the tile floor - not a good scene with kids that ant sit still anyway.   The food The food was exceedingly average.  When I go to a Mediterranean restaurant I'm looking for bright fresh flavors and at the fat Greek it seems like things are more subdued, almost to the point of being, dare I say, bland?  To top it all off, my wife ordered moussaka and they brought it out cold.  Seriously ... cold!  The waiter took it back and they brought her another plate, but this time it was a totally different dish. Oh goodness.  The third time was the charm - but at no point in this escapade did we hear an apology, no offer to comp the meal or any other action to say "hey - we messed up".  Bottom line There are plenty of other places to find really GOOD Greek/Mediterranean food - skip the fat Greek. (this review was from a visit a while ago, I hope things have changed)

Great little place - would be amazing in the cooler weather of fall / winter with the outdoor patios.   For the vegan crowd they offer a veggie fajitas. I didn't bother to ask if there was dairy, but it didn't taste like it, but was very tasty - if only lacking a bit of seasoning on the veggies - but I would rather that than too much salt.   The service was good. The manager checked up on our large party and we had a good experience. If you're in north scottsdale and want Mexican it's worth a try.

The place:  Intimate theater barely begins to describe this theater.  If you weren't specifically looking for it, you wouldn't know it was there.  It's hidden in a strip mall - so make sure you have your directions in hand.  Really it's not that hard to find ...   The experience: Some of THE best entertainment for your dollar in the east valley.  I have been twice, and saw two completely different shows.  Some of the "games" that were played were same/similar, but the audience interactions ensures it's always fresh and new.  We went with a bunch of friends for my wife's birthday - they made sure to get her involved ... and it would up being the funniest part of the show (naturally since they were funning on my family).  They even gave us two free tickets to come back another time!!  My wife and I really enjoyed the experience (as did our friends) and we're excited to use the tickets.  The bottom line: If you're looking for something to do on a Friday or Saturday evening, you'd be hard pressed to find a more enjoyable time.  If you're reading this review before 5/1/09 ... they are having a one year anniversary that weekend ... Friday/Sat/Sun shows ... check it.    You can hit the site showup.com for discounted tickets.  ----The reason only #/5? Like anything, some of the stuff is really funny, but some of the stuff misses ... so a slight knock ... still 100% worth while though.---  Edit: Not only is it an improv comedy theater, but HOLY SMOKES, it is a school too! That makes for a 5 star super fun time awesome place.

The Place: My wife and I knew the general location of the restaurant, but were not familiar with the corner, so we entered the shopping center and literally drove right past the restaurant and only looped back around when my wife's keen eye spotted the strip mall sign near the road.  Needless to say, it's ticked away in an aging shopping mall.  Inside is decorated with similar art that I have seen in other Indian restaurants.  The only thing that detracted a bit for me was the Indian music and videos playing on the TV.  The Food: Great food - vindaloo and eggplant + samosas. Mango lasso We decided to start with veggie samosas which were a revelation.  I suppose my experience with these fried balls of love have only really been with food that was prepared ahead of time and was cold.  These were piping hot and filled with lovely veggies and spices.  Quite a treat.  We ordered chicken vindaloo with a "5" spice which was quite spicy.  The flavors were rich and the meat and veggies plentiful.  This was my favorite.  We also ordered an eggplant dish that was a bit more on the sweet/hot side of things, and was also divine.  The rice that was served was unremarkable, but I'm no rice aficionado.  The coup de gras for the missus and I was the garlic naan.  Holy crispy, garlicy, herby, chewy goodness - it was as if the Indian god of delicious bread stuff dropped a basket on our table.  Yes, I would have eaten that and that alone.  The Bottom Line: It's a shame that this gem isn't closer to my south Chandler abode for I would love to frequent for lunch dinner.  I highly recommend the dinner - and as is par for many Indian restaurants there is a lunch buffet which seemed reasonably priced at somwhere around $7-8.  We spoke to the waitress who I believe was also the owner and met her 3 year old daughter.  It's my pleasure to support good family restaurants like this.  The Taj Mahal is a royal find.

The place: My only knock against this place and I'll get it out of the way up front. Location, location, location.  San Tan Blvd between Power and Sossamon - way the heck out there for most people.  For me, just down the road a few miles.  Inside is a bit cramped and loud, but not unmanageable.  The tables are set with paper and crayons so you can doodle while you wait for your food.  There is a small covered outdoor patio that we have yet to try, but looks like it would be a great place to eat.  The food: Quite possibly the best food I have had in the valley in a really long time.  The two visits I have had have solidified this claim as the sandwiches, soups, and desserts are AMAZING.  The Deli of Queen Creek has something good going - and I hope they are around for a really long time.  The bottom line: Do yourself a favor - fire up google maps, mapquest, or your GPS and make a trip to The Deli. You will not be disappointed.  I promise.  And if you don't like it, please, please, please let them know since they are very willing to work with you..

6 years later and we are still frequenting this family run restaurant. They make good food at reasonable prices. The food is flavorful. The staff is super friendly and always asks after members of my family that are missing for one reason or another.   We love our neighborhood "Fuh".

Avoid this scam factory at all costs. Still fighting with these clowns over 1 year later.   They are trying to bill us for a PREGNANCY TEST for my 10 year old daughter. Uh, really?  They are not allowing my WIFE to speak to them regarding this sham billing process because she is not the "account" holder.   I cannot comment on the quality of their medical care, but their billing practices make their medical care moot.  GIVEN THAT THERE ARE URGENT CARE OFFICES OPENING ON EVERY CORNER LIKE A CIRCLE-K, DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND FIND A DIFFERENT PROVIDER/GROUP.  (and we wonder why our "medical care" costs the most of any first world country ... sham practices like over billing and padding billing are a joke)

If I could give 0 stars, I would.  Other than being conveniently located, I am not sure why I continued to go back to this urgent care.  I was even more upset, when I received a bill (5/2016) for the first time that was for services conducted in 2/2015 that states it is 120+ days past due.  Even more appalling, was the fact that I discovered that they ordered and charged us for a pregnancy test for my 10 year old daughter who was presenting symptoms for a UTI.  The test was conducted without consent from neither myself nor my daughter.  A one sentence question addressed to either of us at the office would have answered the question if there was any possibility of being pregnant as it is medically impossible having not entered puberty.  Unfortunately, my dealings with the billing department have been no better.  I have been trying to speak with the manager for several days and have left messages but not received an answer or call back as promised.  The ladies I have left the messages with have all given me the token answer that the policy is to run a pregnancy test on all females ages 10-50 who present UTI symptoms.  This is done without notification or consent.  I went back through my medical records and discovered that they also ran a pregnancy test for me when I was in for similar symptoms a year or two ago.  Again, they never asked for consent or told me this was going on.  I fear that other unnecessary tests have been run without consent.  I feel like one doctor in particular is always pushing for more testing  (we have been told to get a mono test every time my 10 year old has come in for strep-thankfully I had the opportunity to deny this test).  I have called two other urgent care facilities to see if they have similar policies, and they don't, so I don't believe it is industry wide.  I will never use this company again. Heidi

Boo Los Favs  I've been hitting this location infrequently for many years. I was never impressed with the customer service but the food was decent and the prices decent.   This morning was the last straw. I ordered a bean burrito, no cheese, on a wheat tortilla. $3 & change. What I received was the smallest burrito I've ever seen at a local non-chain place. This was Taco Bell small.   I didn't say anything since the two lads running the place already seemed like they weren't interested in offering any more than bare minimum.   The funny / ironic thing is that I watched the cook make two breakfast burritos ahead of my mini-rito bursting with carne in addition to eggs and whatever else. I mean gut busting size. That carne is far more expensive than my beans that were applied to the tortilla like a thin layer of paint being sprayed on a new McMansion. I guess they are more interested in slinging meat than beans.   Meh. Los Favs is now in the dung heap with Filibertos. I'm sure I'll be healthier for it.   (Side note, I have complete respect and admiration for those in the restaurant industry. It's a tough biz. I ALWAYS try to be kind and understanding that it's tough)

Whoa! Great little Thai & Chinese place. Great prices and quality. The waitress/hostess for the tiny place is super friendly and helpful. And they knew how to make a dish vegan!  Super hot dish I ordered called Drunken Noodles. Had Jalepenos and Thai chiles. My lips are burning / numb. What da.

The place I think this is a converted sandwich shop if memory serves, but the new guys didn't let that stop them from making it feel new and cool.  It is an open kitchen so you can watch the cooks putting your food together and there is much steel used throughout - has a modern feel.  The only thing I'll knock if for is having a TV hanging on the wall.  Why do all restaurants feel like they MUST have a TV?  The food This is why you're here - the food.  My wife and I shared a chicken shawarma pita + fries and a falafel salad.  The salad had six generous falafel on a bed of romaine lettuce, feta cheese, tomato, onion, and a tangy lemon vinaigrette.  The falafel were well spiced and came alive when dabbed with the tahini? sauce that came with it.  The pita had many of the same ingredients as the salad, romaine lettuce, onion, tomato, and to top it off well seasoned chicken and a tzatziki that was dill-icious.  The crinkle cut fries were a good balance of crisp and fluffy.  It's hard to mess up fried potatoes.  The bottom line The lunch "specials" are really only a few cents off the regular prices, but for under $10 you walk away feeling like you've eaten real-whole-food, not some over processed junk from a tube.  I highly recommend the items that we sampled and I'm sure I'll be back to try the gyros.

First visit and I was blown away with how prepared they were for the La Furia Roja soccer supporters group before the first home game of the Arizona United SC season. Literally walked up, ordered food, and was eating within minutes. The beer was flowing if you're into that kind of thing.   The environment is very Euro-beer-garden-outdoor-awesomeness. Who knew that this place was here?! I didn't ... but now I do for sure. Family friendly is always a plus too.  Thank you to Brat Haus for your preparation and execution, I'm looking forward to the next pre-game party as well as visiting for a non-soccer-related meal.  Excellent pretzels Gigantic beer steins Tasty Belgian-style fries Many things to dip said fries and pretzels in Burgers and brats aren't my thing, but other said they were tasty  I didn't ask if I could and where I would order off the menu but I'm sure that's possible as well.  5 stars if the next visit is as good as the first!

I really wish I could rate these guys higher. They get full marks for offering excellent quality foods.   The biggest issue is the service doesn't match the expectations.   Of the 4 visits I have made to this Chandler location, 3 have left me wanting. The counter and kitchen service really let this restaurant down. The latest visit was the final straw, don't think I need to visit again.   It was a Monday night with a very, very light crowd. My bestie and I ordered a salad and a protein bowl, a lemonade, and a kombucha. The kombucha came out after about 5m. The lemonade had to be requested at the counter. The food took close to 15m to come out. They kitchen forgot the curry sauce on my wife's tofu protein bowl and forgot the forbidden rice. Back to the counter and another 10m later the "right" bowl is delivered only to find several long black hairs swimming amongst the food.   We never complain but when the counter guy comes by to check on how the fixed bowl turns out my wife mentions the hair. He says something that makes me think he's going to do something about it, and then we leave 2m later and he's at the register taking orders.   Clearly with 4 stars and tons of reviews they must be doing something right - but the super slow counter service, the haphazard ordering "lines", and the slow kitchen takes this off my list of downtown chandler spots worth visiting. It's a shame because the concept is awesome and DC doesn't have much in the way of vegetarian / healthy options.

Iss' is amazing. Super friendly and wholesome. Great value and you'll walk out full of healthy grub.   I've only been once, but I enjoyed my oatmeal and free cookie (with check-in on yelp).  I'm looking forward to returning with my family so we can sample the pancakes. Nom, nom.

Quick review after 2 visits, one dinner and one lunch buffet.  The buffet is loaded with veggie delights, and a vast majority are vegan (!!) which is great. As usual, I ate too much, but there was so much tasty food to try. The owner circulates to check on his patrons and ensure they are happy. You can order as many dosai as you like - yum.  Dinner was a quiet affair and we had excellent service. We ordered many different items and all were excellent. Good spice level, not ridiculous, but not bland either. They do serve naan so don't be afraid to ask.  I also heard that the buffet items are always changing so that's great if you don't like whats there on a certain day, but could be a bummer if you like something a bunch and can't find it. I do believe you can order from the menu if you need something particular and don't want the buffet.  I am SO HAPPY that the EV has another excellent place for vegans and vegetarians to gobble up tasty food.  In case you were curious/scared, we took omnivores with us and they thoroughly enjoyed the meal and did not miss meat at all.

If you like food. If you like being treated well. If you like a good value. You will like Ruchi.  Lunch, dinner, whatever the meal and whatever the dish - it has all exceeded my expectations. The spice level is plenty high - hardcore heat lovers may think it's too low but I love me some heat and it's at an enjoyable level.  The staff is welcoming and goes out of their way to make sure you have a great experience.  Just stop reading and try it. You'll like it.

First tun through with a twelve dollar wash was good. I felt like my car ran through a little too fast as it didn't get spotless clean.  I'm no car snob or meticulous car detailer. If I was I would certainly consider purchasing the frequent flyer program.  I did not use the vacuum/detail area on this trip as I was in a hurry. All of the equipment is brand new so it should be in good working order. Time will tell if it stays that way.  The staff was efficient and friendly for the few seconds I interacted with them.

I brought my Mazda 5 in for an oil change and general checkup around 7:30am (knowing that our rear brakes may need to be replaced). CBA took the car same-day and said they would likely be completed by noon or 1pm. The shuttle to my final morning destination was convenient and the drive was very friendly.  Later in the morning I got a call that the rear brakes were worn and needed to be replaced. I agreed and they were able to machine the rotors and replace the pads. All work was done by 1pm.  In the end, CBA was friendly, honest, and a good value (double digit % less than the dealer for sure). Their staff uses plain speak and did not try to oversell me.   Bottom line, I am pleased so far and will happily bring my car back again.

Disclosure: this place serves vegan food and automatically gets a +2 review for being awesome in that way. To their credit they are a 4 place anywho so hurry up and check out out!  The place is cool. Hipster cool. Rekindled my love of foosball of all things. Very welcoming to children of the 80's, but those millennial hipsters are more than welcome too. Gen Y - go away.   The main attraction for the evening was a game called Killer Queen that pits 5  vs 5  in a pretty cool action/strategy game that can really only last about 2m max. The down side is it was a tournament and or team was a$$ whipped since we have never played the game before. There were some seriously  at this event and we were bounced early.   The rest of the place is an eclectic mix of console games, pool table, foosball, pinball, and crazy arcade games from all over the world.
