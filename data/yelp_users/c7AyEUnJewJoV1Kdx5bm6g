This place is a train wreck in a refrigerator. Its very cold (which is to be expected) but also extremely dilapidated. The ceiling is falling in, its old and worn, and worst of all, there is NO ONE to control the children.  The children (which are more like teenagers) are running a muck, creating cracks in the ice and throwing it at other people.   I don't like the ice throwing, and I don't like cold ceilings falling in. When asked if you should go to Arcadia say, "No!"

I lived in Chandler my entire life, until three years ago. And now whenever I come back to visit family, I make sure to stop at Abuelo's. That has to be saying something considering that I can go to ANY Mexican restaurant in Phoenix, and I choose this one.  The service is always spot on, the food is always good, and I cannot get enough of their Margaritas. My mom loves their Shrimp cocktail, and I do not disagree. If you want to try something delicious, and unique, I highly recommend ordering it to start. The warm chips/pita things are amazing!

I was in LV for business, as and was lucky enough to join my colleagues at Bouchon for out final dinner.  The service is exquisite. The servers really know their stuff and are very pleased to make your every wish come true. The food is amazing, from the foi gras, the seafood towers, to the dessert. It was all amazing, and ridiculously filling, but SO SO GOOD!   I cannot tell you how delicious the Steak Bouchon is. But let me tell you this, if I could eat steak every day, I would want mine from Bouchon. Juicy, tender, and flavorful. Well worth they $45 price.  If you are in Vegas, and you want to do Vegas up the right way, go to Bouchon!

The staff at this location are the nicest people I have ever encountered. Having been to DSW stores all over the country, I say the staff at this location are amazing. Customer service doesn't get any better!

Fun! Friendly! Delicious!  Those are the three words that come to mind after I recall my visit to Su Vino Winery (SVW). It was a great trip to Old Town Scottsdale, and I was pleasantly surprised by the experience.  I am now living in DC, and bought a Groupon to SVW to have an outing with the family. So, my parents and I made the trek from Chandler to Scottsdale to attend our first ever wine tasting. I was expecting stuffy Scottsdale owners and servers who would talk down to us due to our ignorance in all things wine related. This is was not the case is the slightest. We were greeted very warmly and asked to be seated at the bar. After telling our server that we did not know a thing about wine, she patiently explained how the menu worked, how our Groupon was to be used, and what wines she believed we would enjoy the most. Boy was she dead on! As much as I would love to say that I enjoy a full-bodied Sryah, I am more of a fruity/fizzy kind of girl, and opted for the lighter selections. My father, who is a whiskey/brandy/scotch drinker, did the same while mom my opted to be the DD.   The entire experience was delightful. Between the three of us, we order two apps (cheese plate & antipasto) and my dad and I samples 5 different wines. Surprisingly, all of the wines are grown locally, and are VERY VERY GOOD.   I highly recommend trying SVW. The staff are great, the service is impeccable, and the  ambiance is inviting. I visited in the late afternoon, but overheard the staff talking about their very busy evening ahead. I suggest make a reservation if you are planning to go at night.

"Heaven, I'm in heaven. And my heart beats So that I can hardly speak..."  That's how I feel about BLT burger, and that is the song that should be playing 24 hours a day.  Shakes - there are very few places where you can get a good shake. There are even fewer places that make a good shake with a splash of goodness that makes you smile a bit more than you did when you got off the plane to start your Vegas excursion. Well, BLT has good shakes, had good adult shakes, and will leave a smile on your face for the rest of the day.  Burgers - the burgers are delicious! Savory, beefy, cheesy, and all things yummy. I can't say anything more about the burgers except that they were very good. You really just need to bite down on one yourself.  Fries - I say go with the waffle fries.  The skinny fries are just okay. But the waffle fries are very crispy! And a great shape for a potato!!  Oh man, I am craving a milkshake and burger as I sit in my DC office. I am also craving another adventure to Vegas!

My experience is just like the Yelp commentary above "Meh. I've experienced better."   This sushi wasn't bad tasting, but it wasn't great. I think there are plenty of better sushi joints in the Chandler, Temple area. Also, the prices are not much better than regular sushi prices, especially considering how little food is presented on the plate.  Maybe after a little while they will get it together. There was not much offered on the conveyor belt but it was after the lunch rush. The wait to get more food was ridiculous.   It just wasn't that great. There is a much better sushi place in Tempe.
