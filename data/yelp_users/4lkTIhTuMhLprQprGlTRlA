There's no better way to undo a 3 mile morning walk than to end up stuffing your face at the Comedor.  This place is muy grande and could be the perfect spot for a very very large dinner party. The parking lot is huge and is tended by courteous security guards who welcome you in at the door. The menu is extensive and offers some unusual items such as Chicharrone (pork rind) and Nopales (cactus) dishes along with an interesting   Caldo de Mariscos (Seafood Soup). Great if you're looking for some food adventure! Que suave~  I started my post walk lunch with a cold Pacifico that came with a large frosty mug. Man that beer went down good!  The chips were delivered warm with a side of chili tepin style salsa.  For starters, we ordered the Frijoles con Chorizo dip. I'm not huge fan of chorizo but really enjoyed this dip. The chorizo was mild (not greasy at all) and was served with oven toasted chips topped with melted cheese. We shared a plate of the Chili Verde con Papas which is a rich green chili sauce with chunks of beef, potatoes, and onions served with refried pinto beans and tortilla. For our other dish, we had the Chilaquiles Y Huevos. This dish was the main reason we went to Comedor and it didn't disappoint.  This was layered corn tortillas soaking in a red chili sauce and topped with two over medium eggs and served with a side of frijoles and warm tortilla. The only problem I ran into was eating way more then I should have. It must be a good sign if you waddle out of the place whining and holding your gut.  I'll be heading back very soon to try the Nopalito dish and the Pescado Entero Tilapia; Pan Freed "whole" Tilapia. Can't wait!

The Downtown Deli is my go to whenever I'm jonesing for loads of meat or a fat juicy dog. I've had every meat sandwich on the menu over the last 10 years and my favorite is the Skyscraper. Mounds of Corned Beef & Pastrami w/ melted Swiss, Dijon slathered on Marble Rye, with a side of French fries, a pickle wedge, and large Root Beer. I'm not a huge hot dog fan but I'll break down once in a while and go for the 1/4 lb all Beef Dog with Straw. It's a pretty darn good dog! The dogs go for around 3 bucks and the specialty sandwiches start at $8.25. But they are well worth it.   Warning: This is not the place for people who are looking for a light meal or can't stomach a Motha of a sandwich. You will get dirty looks from waiting patrons and you'll throw the line cook off his game if you ask for a healthy alternative to the specialty sandwiches. Stick to the menu and you'll be just fine except for needing to take your belt out a notch; no harm in that.

Not sure how well kept this secret is or if it's a secret at all but buy some cheap tix, make a reservation and share a mountain of nachos and have the banana split. Sweet Hey-Zeus, it's an entire half gallon of ice cream and WE TORE IT UP.  And that is no stretch of my wild imagination.  Who knows...You may win yourself some much needed cool points on the dating front. Give it a swing.

Two words sum it up; tasty and filling.  We started with the Plato Tipico which is a fried appetizer sampler and includes a chicken tamale, two beef  & papa empanadas, two papusas and  yucca fries. I was loving the bean and cheese filled papusa and my friend was all about the tamale.  I ordered the avocado salad hopping it would be on the exotic side but it was just a standard dinner salad topped with sliced avocado. Aside from our appetizer and salad, we ordered an additional round of pork, cheese and bean papusas. All were very good and were the main reason for our visit. However, after looking at the rest of the menu, we'll be back to try the carne asada platter and relleno plates.  All in all, a deliciously satisfying meal and definitely a spot I will return to again and again.  Note: Parking is out back and they close at 8:30.

It's been many many moons since I last had a meal at Rito's. I'm talking like 1994 and not much has changed, it is all so like back in the day.  I still get the feeling I'm visiting my grandmother and driving through the old neighborhood to get to the converted house to restaurant gives me the feeling of going home.    Today I had the red chili burrito enchilada style with a side of beans just like I used to have every payday when I worked at the local bank up the street. This burrito portion is huge and the red sauce was just a little over spicy like I remembered. I even had to wipe the sweat beads off my nose a few times.  So good, I'll say.  The menu is online, I called a head for pick up, I took cash, there is limited outdoor seating and parking might be an issue.

Las Noches de las Luminarias is in full swing and even better this year with the addition of Dale Chihuly's glass sculpture exhibit. Each sculpture is perfectly integrated with the landscape along the many luminary lit pathways. There is plenty to do, see, and hear as you stroll throughout the garden. You will find comfy fire pit seating areas, great live musicians, and a few bars nestled along the path. Dress warm and wear comfy shoes because some of the paths are a little rocky. I recommend the evening event after the luminarias have been lit - 5:30 to 9:30pm.   My high marks for this outing:   Sweater Weather: 5  Glass Sculptures: 5  Photo Ops: 5  Luminarias: 5  Musicians: 5  Apple Cider: 5  Shot of Jack Daniels: 5++

Man-oh-man, this place is da bomb!   The So and I came in on a Wednesday night after slamming a few Long Islanders at the bar next door, so we were geared up for some serious grubbing. We were seated immediately and greeted by our server Alberto. Wow, this guy had a golden personality and was working his station like a champ. He was making great conversation with every table and attended to us like royalty.   We ordered the fried zucchini & mushroom plate and a medium pepperoni pizza. The friend zucchini and shrooms were very tasty and we were provided plenty of ranch for dipping.  Our pizza was delivered to our table still bubbling and with a warning from Alberto, "Now you two take it easy, this pizza is Super HOT and I can tell you from experience because I no longer have the roof of my mouth, Enjoy". So I lifted the toasty-melty-saucy slice up to my face, hoisted it into my mouth, sank my fangs into it, and almost fainted with pleasure. I swear I could hear Lou Rawls singing in my ear as I worked my way down the slice to the crust.   This was one hell of a Pizza and a great price to boot. Dinner (Appetizer, Pizza, and Root Beer) for two under 20 bucks. I may have to give in and be a repeat offender next week. Oh well, I'll just tell them the Devil made me do it.

It was a very hot (sweltering) and sweaty (soaked head to toe) experience. The temperature read was 114* and the added humidity made it feel like hellfire. I was miserable fifteen minutes into the class and I wanted to bail but I didn't want to give up because I had to prove my endurance and sustainability to my friend. A respectable guest doesn't just up and quit!  Every minuet felt like twenty and there I was stretching, pulling, bending, twisting, arching AND SWEATING for 90 full minuets. No Pain - No Gain and in the end I found it to be fantastic. Kinda like when you  feel like your gonna die and you make a deal with God that if you so happen to survive that you will never do...(insert most recent transgression here)  and then you actually survive and go on to be a better person spreading, love, peace and happiness. Yeah, just like that.  The Triangle and the Standing Bow Pose were my favorites but the Eagle and Floor Bow crushed me.   Did my mind and body good. Party~

I had an instant craving for some Chinese take-out and fortunately there were 15 minuets left before closing so I hit China Chili on the speed dial. I ordered the House Chow Mien which was ready just as I walked through the door. I could feel my food still sizzling through the Styrofoam to-go container. I couldn't get home fast enough and the smell from the back seat was so tempting I was close to pulling off to the side of the road and diving in. So I get home rip open the plastic bag to find my noddles steaming and filled with shrimp, pork, chicken, and scallions. This was one delicious meal (way better than Pei Wei) and the portion was huge for just under $9 bucks. I stuffed my face crazy and sill have enough for left overs or until I get hungry again in the next hour or so.

Great place for a good drink and tasty burger!  I'm no expert in the rules of local brew, however, I give a good head nod to the Hefeweizen. It's crisp and hits the spot on a hot hot day. If you've got a craving for some good grub then I recommend the Brewery burger with a side of fries. If you're feeling a little adventurous add on some bacon, blue cheese crumbles and slather on some Dijon. It's a sure way to get you way past full.  The Fish N Chips are just as good and if you're not a drinker grab a pint of Root-Beer.   Sunday and Monday's are $3.00 pint nights with the purchase of the logo glass so I intend to put it to good use. Great way to kick-off the week!

I'm a new patient at Phoenix Skin and I was impressed with the staff, appointment process and follow-up. Dr. Tania was awesome and she knew almost immediately during my check up what the cause and best treatment to resolve my problem would be. Although those six shots to the head hurt like a Mo Fo, the team made me feel comfortable and served up my healing with a smile, gentle touch and genuine concern. I was happy to find a solution and I started feeling better and noticing improvements within a few hours. Two days later, issue resolved.   Thanks Phoenix Skin!

This Starbucks has been remodeled and now looks like a hospital cafeteria. Gone are the plush velvety sofas and over-sized chairs which I loved to sit on while flipping through a good mag or chatting it up with a pal. No more warm and fuzzy feeling Starbucks. I hate this new look and will not be back EVER! BTW - The place was empty at 10am on a Saturday. Hmmm?

FYI, the two seats at the end of the bar are reserved for me at all times. Well at least they should be and I'll say they are the best seats in the house. We get to see every dish that comes from behind the bar and usually make our dinner selection based on the "order up" items. It makes for an adventurous dinning experience.  My faves and must tries are the Extremely Spicy Gyoza Pot-Pot Stickers in Spicy Soup and the Tori Nanban (add Sansai Vegi). I have the Gyoza soup first then whatever brothy goodness is still left at the bottom of my bowl I add to my Tori Nanban. It's weird but a tasty ritual.  The Iron Pot soups are also really good.  I've yet to have any of the Italian pasta dishes. Although they look just as good as the Asian items, it just doesn't seem right for me to order Italian. Who knows, maybe I'll give one a try on my next visit.   The CBNC does get busy with a wait during the lunch and dinner hours and service can be inconsistent outside of the bar which is another reason I sit at the bar.  But I feel the food makes up for just a few easy to overlook annoyances.

A&D is a cool guys barber shop dream and the only place I go to tame my wild hairs. Art runs a tight operation and all the barbers are up to speed on the latest techniques. As Glaucus said, they can tackle any razor, scissor, or e-shaver cut you need with meticulous execution and these guys are cool & genuine to-boot.   My barber Boris was just off his shift and headed out the door when he saw me drive up. He was waiting for me at his station when I walked in. Where does anyone get service like that these days? Well at A&D that's where.   So what does a $19 haircut get you? A top notch barber, a beer, flat screens showing sports and action packed movies, a killer cut, razor clean-up w/lather, scalp & shoulder massage, a steam towel on the face, and a gelled style. It's a tad more than the chain chop shops but hell fellas we're worth it!   So give it a go, I'm sure you'll be happy you did.

It was well worth getting all dappered up for the evening. One can't be too over dressed for a night out at the opera. The vocal talent was exceptional and no one missed a mark delivering the story. It was fantastic and I enjoyed meeting a few of the department directors. VIP? Yes please and thank you.

It only cost me $4.00 to re-cover my dinning room chairs with the coolest chevron pattern fabric I found at SAS.  I could spend way too many hours debating on either houndstooth or chevron, I'm happy I went with the chevron and my custom restored table looks great.  It even got a new designer paint job. Restored for $25 vs. slapping down $700 on a new one. Yeah, I win! The SAS staff were very helpful  and my associate was very eager to help me and gave me a thumbs up on  my selection.

I recently scored a pair of Marc Ecko Jeans, a "Fight Visual Pollution" graphic tee, a studded leather wrist band and a black bow tie all for $27 bucks - WOWZA!  I really like bow ties and I can hardly wait to wear this one out to an event or maybe even the cinema.  Until then, I'll wear it in the privacy of my home while sipping on a filthy martini and flipping through my old vinyl records.

Holy cinnamon all up in your face!  Cinna-cones, cinna-brooms, cinna-wreaths,  cinna-scents galore! Everything smells like cinnamon and I hate the smell of cinnamon! I even smelled like cinnamon a day after going into the store.  I burped and guess what it smelled like? CINNAMON!   Happy Holidays

Man what a mess! I found myself walking in circles trying to figure out where to start and where to end. Everything is out of order and the placement of new releases (movies and music) makes absolutely no sense. This store could use a training day in merchandising. The staff seem disengaged and not familiar with the product. Want to throw the staff for a loop, ask for a copy of LA VIE EN ROSE...had to repeat the title several times to two different people who could not figure out what I was asking for. Oh forget it!  Sincerely,  Empty Handed

First, I'd like to send a shout-out to Irma, our server who has given me hope that there are caring hospitable people in the food industry.  Irma receives 5 stars for taking good care of me and my sweetheart during our recent date at the Havana Cafe. Way to go Irma!  We step into a well packed restaurant on a Friday night with plans to try the Sailor's Paella Special and a few cocktails. We wait for just a few seconds until we are greeted by Irma and her warm smile and are led to our table. Our cocktail orders are taken immediately, 1 Mojito and 1 White Sangria. Both exceeded our expectations and were just thing to get our date started.  The ambiance is whimsical and charming - Reminded me of the movie "The Bird Cage" without the drag queens and dramatic dialogue. Bummer!  Now on to the Paella. It was the perfect dish for the evening offering plenty of shrimp, calamari, crab, scallops, muscles, tuna and a healthy serving of saffron rice. This meal also requires a little handy work to get to the crab and muscles but you are given the proper instruments to do so. This may not be the best choice for those who do not enjoy this kind of food activity but we had a lot of fun with it.  We will be back soon to try another interactive meal and partake of a round or two of Mojitos.   So if you are in the mood for something different, fun, and oh so delicioso, I recommend you try a night out at the Havana Cafe. I also hope you have the pleasure of meeting a groovy gal who goes by the name Irma.

One lap around the rink and my feet were cracking! How is it that everyone else around me can strap on a pair of skates and hit the ice without any sign of fear and with confident poise and precision?  Unfortunately, I would not be singing the phrase, look mom no hands, during this ice skating field trip as my attempt was a total fail.  It's a good thing I had Julia T. at my side to help guide me hand in hand during my 10 min lap. Her calming voice in my left ear reminding not to chip at the ice, glide from side to side, hold your balance, you're doing good, come on you got it, yea right! This was much easier said than done and I was happy to get off the ice after one, full, long, torturous lap around the arena.          So other than my lackluster debut, I'm giving a positive nod to AIA for a few very good reasons. Bringing me in out from the 113 degree heat, a very affordable activity, and for the quick getaway to the Ice House to partake in a before/after refreshment where next time, I'll be skating vicariously through my oh so cool friends. I'll be grinning from spectator box.

Great place for Mexican Baked Goods (Pan Dulce). They have cochitos, churros, zinger rolls, Mexican wedding cookies, empanadas, and several other festive pastries.  I like to drop in on my way to the office when I'm feeling nice and want to treat my co-workers to a little culture. Unlike bagels and store bought doughnuts, these treats are always gone by mid morning and that's how I like it.  Also good for a hearty breakfast burrito.  Try the Chorizo, Potato, Bean and Egg 4-way. Que Bueno!  I can't vouch for any of the lunch/dinner combo meals but will return for the baked goods and burritos.

Our hike began by driving up to Dobbins Lookout taking in the amazing view then sprinting down Holbert Trail to the large water tank and hiking back up again. Although I don't recommend running the trail (for safety reasons) it was the perfect adrenaline rush I needed for the day.  This hike really gave us a great work out. We were both drenched by the time we retuned to the lookout. The city view from the trail is amazing and there are some awesome rock formations to discover along the way. I would agree that the view from the lookout is breathtaking especially if you are all out of breath from the run up the trail.   As other Yelpers noted this hike is described as difficult and I would agree, however, you can increase that to highly difficult if you decide to run the trail but the reward is in the amazing workout you'll get.   Additional tips: Ample parking at the base of Holbert Trail and Dobbins Lookout, a visitor center, picnic areas, and plenty of trails (with difficulty levels marked).

I was a guest of one of the VIPs during the recent Center Stage event, showcasing 4 bands and a selected dinner/drink menu. Our seats were directly stage right and we had a great view of the bands that performed throughout the night - all were very very talented and entertaining.  I hear they play through the week so I will defiantly return based on the band selection alone. The pre selected menu was quite impressive. Our starter was the antipasti which was loaded with a selection of cheese, olives, fig chutney, apricot puree, grilled asparagus, and a mini mound of prosciutto and capicolla - severed with perfectly crisp bread. Seriously a meal on its own.  Our next item was the spicy tuna roll. We had a repeat order on this item or I should admit, I had a repeat order.  I ate most of our shared order and the additional round. I love Sushi and this was pretty good sushi. I hear the newly installed sushi bar is quite the hit. I'll be back for that, too.  My drink selection for the evening was the prickly pear margarita. I indulged just a tad, if you can call 8 rounds a tad. Yup they were that good.   We enjoyed a stroll throughout the property post entertainment, dinner and drinks and I was impressed with the layout of the property and the many resort/spa options. Hey lookey there, A Gondola Ride!!!!! Gotta try that when the weather cools down for sure.  Getting that guided tour sure made me feel like an A-lister or it could have been all the margaritas. As such, my plans on my next staycation are in the works.

The doggie wash station is great way to bathe my boys in between grooming and not break my back and the bank. Unfortunately, there a no express car washes with doggie station in the down town area so I need to haul across god's green acre with this location being the closest. That's okay because this location is kept super clean with friendly attendants to answer any questions. The doggie station accepts card so it was an easy process. You swipe and you're charged by the time you spend using the system. For me that was two dogs, wash and completely dry for 15 minuets for exactly $14. I would have paid double this amount anywhere else. The small doggie area is enclosed and secure so my little guy can't escape and only one customer is allowed in the area at a time. Love that!

I've been a member of this YMCA since I was 8yrs old. Back in the day, a light blue conversion van would pull up to the neighborhood stop where a group of me and my friends were waiting eagerly to be collected and it would bus us to the downtown Y. You see back then we didn't know we were poor and we certainly didn't know we were part of a program to keep at-risk kids off the streets and out of gangs. We just knew we would get a free breakfast, free lunch, possibly a nap on a cool mat and a full day of Foosball, bumberball, checkers, indoor volleyball and god's eye craft time. Those sure were some fun times!  Fast forward thirty years and I am still a member, this time a paying member. Not much has changed about the Y. They still have programs for the kinds, the elderly, the homeless and they have a great work out facility with some awesome group exercise programs.  I've been taking Marco's cardio kickboxing class for a couple of years and he is a great instructor.  I could barely make it through half his class when I first started but I stuck with it and picked up some great shadow boxing moves and I now have endurance to sustain for a full hour of swinging, kicking and bending.  I think He's kind of a rock star but I won't tell him that. Most recently I've taken up Zumba and I have to admit, I made fun of it at first. From the outside looking in, it looks silly, however, I gave it a try for two weeks and I am hooked. It's been two months now and I've dropped eight extra pounds by adding Zumba to my cardio workout. Yes people, I am hip-hopping, samba-ing, mambo cha cha-ing my way to fit and I don't care how silly it looks. I feel great! I've got my eye on an early morning yoga class, that trial period starts next week.   With all my time in the gym and in group exercise classes I guess the overall at-risk program has proven successful. It's keeping me out of the bars (at least on weeknights) and off the streets . Yay-Y!

I've been passing this place for decades and today is the first time I stopped in for a take out meal. The red chili burrito side of beans no rice  was the bomb. All these years gone by but today was the day like something glorious. They have mexican pizza and chicken fundido...holy heysus!

It was my first time ever eating at this restaurant and I will never go back again. I had the Nana's Breakfast and there was something very strange about the over easy eggs. The yolks were very pungent and were way to thick for my liking, almost gummy. I could only eat half of one and moved the rest onto a small side plate. I am not a finicky eater at all but I just could not finish it. Then I moved on to the red chili. I could not eat this stuff. I was soo spicy hot, It was inedible. I did however eat the hash browns which was difficult because the egg was starting make a reappearance via a burpy aftertaste.   So now I will forever respectfully refer to this place as La Ca-Nasty!

Where else can one have an impromptu dance off with a drunkard and hold up the juke box just for the hell of it? The HH, as referred to by an infamous crew of Yelpers, is a walk on the very wild side. Be warned, this place aint pretty and you'll probably be wondering what the hell you are doing there in the first place. Then without warning you're sucked into the insanity, doing things way out of character. Well at least I did. Hmmm, must have been something in the Chocolate Cake. Yes, they serve Cake!  Beer is cheap; plenty of pool tables, darts, juke box, and good for crazy people watching.   The men's restroom is freaking disgusting. Come on guys, poop goes in the toilet.   Try not the break the seal and you'll be fine.

Why 5 stars? 1. Yelper sightings 2. A grown man bathing at the water pump 3. Red Hat Society members filling up on hot dogs and soda  4. Clean Store and Clean Professional Staff that have all their teeth     And 5. The Bomb Burrito (That ones for you Bacon Boy!)

Maxim is the perfect spot to get your soup on. I've been a few times this year and usually get cravings on days when the weather is cool or rainy.  On our most recent visit, we were running late, actually they had just turned off the "open" sign. However, when the owners noticed our disappointed faces they waived us back in along with a couple behind us who were just as happy to receive the same treatment.  This alone secures a few stars for feeding us after hours.  Thanks Maxim!  On this visit, we had a heaping bowl (shared by two) of wonton noodle soup that allowed for seconds. The soup contained pork, shrimp and stuffed wontons. The broth was tasty and the noodles cooked perfectly.  I've yet to try a soup meal that wasn't excellent.   Our second item was the pork and shrimp pancake which I especially like and order every time. It's more like a stuffed crape than a pancake and is very good.    Each meal was served with loads of salad items such as lettuce, cilantro, lime, mint and jalapeños.  You can add these to your meals along with any of the condiments at the table. Yes, they have Sriracha!   Other items I've enjoyed that have me returning time after time are the spring rolls and the Pho. The Pho is insanely good. The portion is huge so share with a friend.  The only thing that's a little off is the music that's played while dinning. The music was serenading cats meowing. At first I thought it was crying babies but nope, cats.  This is an interesting feature that will take some getting used to, for me at least.   Enjoy!

I've passed Pepe's Taco Villa for years and decided to stop in for what else? TACOS! Well... Big Time disappointment! I had the # 13, Crispy Chicken Tacos, side of rice & beans and a Guacamole Cheese Crisp.  The Tacos were exactly like the ones served up in grade school; Come on Pepe, taco shells out of a box!!!! Chicken was bland, and the rice & beans were average. The Salsa was more like Katsup with chili peppers. The Cheese Crisp was Great but It takes a lot to mess up a cheese crisp. I give 2 stars for the guac, it was the only thing that tasted "authentico" to me. Too Bad oh soo sad. Now I must tend to my heartburn. Adios!

My boys Brady and Munchie absolutely love their Claws and Paws grooming sessions.  Cathy and the team have been handling their grooming needs for a couple years and they do an amazing Schnauzer cut. They are miracle workers when it comes to Munchie and his matting issues and even recommended a special cut to help make it easier for me to maintain in between appointments.  Due to my unpredictable schedule pre-booking my appointments is always a challenge; however, they do their best to squeeze us in within a few days of calling. We're often on the "squeeze us in if you have a cancellation" list. I've never been disappointed and the boys appreciate that too.   I also give Cathy and the team high marks for the cleanliness of the shop, follow-up and great customer service.  These ladies truly demonstrate genuine care for my pets and my boys and I love them for that. Woof Woof - Bow Wow!

I've been going to Crazy Jim's for at least 12 years and it is one of my favorite spots for anything Feta. I have probably had every item on the menu throughout this 12 year relationship and have never had anything I did not like. Here are my top 5:   1. Gyro Feta Pita (loaded with gyro meat, onions, tomatoes, and feta) 2. Spring Mix Chicken Feta Salad (Enough to feed two people) 3. Calamari Feta Salad (Crunchy and tasty)  4. Penelope Pizza (Chicken and Artichoke) 5. Fresh Warm Pita Bread (a must have)  The restaurant is cozy, casual, clean, and the staff is very friendly and prompt.    I have tried other Greek restaurants in Phx that have either been way to gimmicky or a total bust and none compare to Crazy Jim's. If anything ever happened to this place I would go "CRAZY"!!!!!!

I've gone to the Great Wall twice in the past few weeks and both times were fun, crazy, and memorable. We went on Sunday within the 10am hour and we were sat almost immediately and were rolling our chopsticks within 10 minutes. If you're one for new experiences and can tolerate a little disorganization then you will be just fine. Don't expect to be catered to because this place can be a free for all once the crowds kick in (11:30am) . You gotta be quick with what you want and don't stand around asking the cart staff in-depth questions like What's that?, What's in that?, and is that spicy? Be quick, look, and nod because you are holding up the line for the rest of us! Because Me soo hungry!  Don't be startled by the slowly moving cart with the 2 foot mound of noodles making its way through the eagerly awaiting crowd. Oh and yes, you will see Chicken Feet, lots of them. However, if you're not that adventurous then there are plenty of other treats to chose from. Just throw caution and pretense to the wind, dive in and enjoy!   Unfortunately I am not able to make any specific reccommendations because I don't know how to spell or pronounce most of the items on the carts... Sorry!

My friend told me about a recent clearance special he stumbled upon and I doubted the savings and quality of clothing.  It was 70% off items already drastically reduced. I assumed it was all crappy, disposable unwanted poorly designed apparel but I was wrong.  I found a cool graphic tee for $3.99, flat front chinos for $8, charcoal cords for $6, euro shams for $2.99, pajama bottoms for $6, and a few other reduced quality items. Who cares if it was last seasons or even last decade's designs? The prices are bahhhhhhhnanas!  I'll also add it was very well organized and the racks/shelves were surprising well maintained compared to other bargain basement outlets I've been to and add way better than Last Chance. The items are new never used. Shoe department sucks tho.  I was tempted to walk the mall for an Orange Julius and a hot pretzel but then I remembered I hate malls.

We walked right in with no wait and got two seats at the far end of the bar. We were waited on almost immediately and decided on a celebratory round of cocktails. We were post Camelback hike and two very hungry guys.  I had a vodka cran splash of pineapple and greyhound. They were very refreshing. We both ordered the Green Flannel Hash and I added an order a side of pancakes and bacon. It was a huge meal and very very good. My hash was loaded with jalapenos which I was teased because I ended up picking half of them out. Embarrassingly I have to admit, it was a smidge too spicy for me and I may never hear the end of it either. Although our server was very timely, the arrival of our meals was just a little long but it wasn't a problem because we struck up a great conversation with two gals that were visiting Scottsdale and we talked about places to dine, visit and enjoy and it made the wait hardly noticeable.  From reading other reviews it appears service and expediting have been major issues. But we really didn't experience that during our visit. Thankfully!  The food was great.

This location is CLOSED for good and unfortunately we had to find out the hard way.  We'd been drinking at the pool all afternoon and my friend has been talking about all you can eat shrimp for over a week. He really loves Red Lobster.  It was quite crushing to UBER all the way from CenPho to Scottsdale only to arrive to a closed restaurant. Even our driver was devastated.  We made the best of the situation and just continued drinking for the remainder of the night.   I called Red Lobster headquarters this morning and was told the property had been sold to a developer and that store is now closed.

The Phoenician Easter Brunch rocked my world and so did the three lovely ladies who were my date. The Easter Bunny was kind of creepy but I still sat on his lap; no furry fetish here. The food was amazing! We ate and drank for 5 wonderful hours, walked the grounds, passed out on the lawn, sat upon a bridge and stared at the waterfall.   Did I mention the food was amazing?   All YOU CAN EAT and ever flowing bottles of Champagne!   Round 1: Civiche, crab claws, lox, shrimp, oysters, smoked snapper, potato cakes and caviar.  Round 2: Lamb, prime rib, rosemary potatoes, grilled asparagus, cheese ravioli, deviled egg, spicy tuna and a dinner roll.  Round 3: A variety of pate, crab cakes, spicy cheese and a watermelon wedge.  Round 4: Bread pudding, tiramisu, chocolate éclair and a macaroon.  Round 5: Chocolate bunny!   It was quite the smash!

My life has never been the same since Ayako of Tokyo located at the Biltmore Fashion Park was shut down. However, Kyoto of Scottsdale has to be the next best thing for Sushi and Saki B's. While the trendy "A Crowds" are dumping loads of cash on high priced drinks, mediocre sushi and snobby service, I am stuffing my face silly at Kyoto. Don't expect fancy frills here just damn good and inexpensive eats.  Itadakimasu

I always purchase my tortillas hot off the belt. They are best that way and I love being able to see the entire assembly process.  The baked products are quite exceptional and I prefer this bakery over the ranch style markets. I don't want to have to dig through baked goods with other people's hands possibly coming in contact with my selections. La Purisima gives me a sense of comfort that the baked goods are daily fresh and with high quality control.  They also sell tamales, burritos and other tasty selections besides baked good and the prices are outstanding.  The tortillas make great quesadillas, home made burritos or just warmed up and slathered with butter.  I no longer purchase store bought tortillas.   No cards accepted cash only.

A couple of co-workers and I ventured out to the "Barrio" this afternoon for lunch.  If you do plan to go for your lunch hour, carpool with co-workers because parking is very limited and plan for an extended lunch because you very well might spend over an hour here. We showed up at noon, not packed at all, however, our service was very slow. The time it took our server to take our order, deliver our food and drop our check seemed way too long. The seating is uncomfortable and may be a little crowded for those with space issues.   However, the food is great! If you're one to overlook the aforementioned cons, then you will love the Barrio hands down! In lieu of chips and salsa, you will be served bread and tapenade. Try the Guacamole, made fresh upon order and is served with tostada chips. This Gauc is really good!!!!  I had the Torta de Pollo - grilled chicken breast served on a warm pannini style bread and slathered with great flavors. But wait! Don't stop there.. You have got to leave room for  Postres! OMG!!!!! The Churros Rellenos KICK!!!! These are not to be confused with the Churros you may have had at Disney Land. These Churros are served with warm caramel sauce, vanilla bean ice cream and candied walnuts. It is a crime to not have these fritters.    I struggled giving 5 stars because of the lack of parking, slow service, and uncomfortable seating. However, This will not stop me from making another trip to the Barrio.    See you there!

We completed our seven summit mountaineering adventure by saving the very best for last. We decided on the Cholla Trail side of the camel's back and it was brutal on my body. I was finished and ready to call it less than half way up. I was wrecked but my hiking buddy kept me on my toes. I pushed all the way up sweat soaked through my tee but it was most rewarding when we reached the top.  Our plan was to reach all of the seven summits of Phoenix by the end of April and we reached our goal two months ahead of our completion date. WE ROCK! The hike is steep, rocky and you will get a full body work out using your hands, knees, sliding down maneuvering around over and across.   I did manage to scuff up my knee attempting a Spiderman move and I tore into my ankle on a slide down a not so flat boulder.  As such, my shoes are trashed and I will be rewarding myself with a new pair.  We plan on hiking the Echo Canyon side of the camel very soon.    A few tips: Parking sucks- and we have the violation to prove it.  The No Parking signage really means no parking (lol). Take water and lots of it Take your dog but pick up after it.  Avoid the crowds - go early. We arrived early morning with low traffic up but it was super bustling on the way down, lines of hikers up makes for a not so fun workout.

Now serving breakfast and Cibo offers the perfect alfresco experience. I've always loved the front portion of the property and today we enjoyed perfect weather and an amazing meal.  I want to move in! We both started with a cocktail, I had the Bellini and we looked over the menu and both decided on the Fritatta Melfitana, an egg omelet filled with Schreiner's sausage, mozzarella cheese, Schreiner's bacon and topped with grated Pecorino Romano and chives.  Our dish came with roasted potatoes with chives, toasted bread, marmalades and a side fruit parfait. The price point is just a tad higher than most places BUT the quality, taste and presentation make it well worth the extra change.    I posted a pic, yeah...THAT GOOD!

Lisa G, you had me at Balls!   Who can resist a trio of piping hot tasty meatballs (Veal/Pork/Beef) soaking in a savory red marinara sauce topped with grated parm and served with warm Foccaccia Bread? Not me! These balls are soo good, I had them two days in a row. Yep, I'm a fan but my delight doesn't end with the balls. I enjoyed every other plate I had during my repeat dinning experience.   Empanadas: Wow! The crust alone is to live for! Each bite melted in my mouth and I enjoyed the tasty center too.   Skewer Plate: This is the perfect sharing dish. Chicken, Beef, Shrimp, and Veggie skewers (2 of each) served with two delicious sauces. Both are good but I preferred the Chipotle sauce. This dish is screaming for a fruit skewer; grilled pineapple maybe?   Mini Sandwiches: A great option for a first timer. This dish offers a selection of three mini sandwiches (your choice) from the main menu. I loved this idea because I can try each and decide which one I would like in the big sandwich size. Each were good but the AHI and Chicken Salad were my favorites; AHI being the top.   Lisa G doesn't just offer up great food, this is also one cool happening joint. It's a converted 19 something-ish bungalow turned Café, Wine, Art  Bar. The music selection also adds to the dinning experience. Can't go wrong with Billie and Ella singing you through a meal right?  The service was great during both my visits. They were courteous, responsive, and served with a smile both times.  So hey, give at go and don't forget to try them balls. I'm sure you'll enjoy.

This place fails on so many levels. First off, $5 cash cover to get past the door only to find yourself wanting to bail in less than 60 seconds. The music was being played at a ridiculous level, tough to hear your self think let alone carry a conversation with members of your dinner party. The service was atrocious and our server wins thumbs down for being the worst in the 602. Our drink orders were delayed and staggered leaving some with empties for far too long and they ran out of Pacifico. Major fail! Our food was lackluster at best. We had the cheese crisp and Carne Asada tacos. The food was cheap and it was evident in the taste and presentation. Paper plates, Seriously?! Was this a restaurant/bar turn cheesy hip-hop club or vice versa. It's difficult to eat a meal and enjoy the company of friends with people crowding all around you. The place lacks flow and swagger in major way. Meh. I've experience better.

I love little Saigon. Super clean, super friendly, great service and the food is delicious and cheap.   The pot stickers are stuffed to the seam with shredded (not minced) pork and are seared and steamed perfectly.  I usually go for the Pho but will switch up for the beef and shrimp rice vermicelli every other visit. I always want Pho tho.  I've never left disappointed. I think I'm a regular now.  Another nice to know is that most of the cafés, restaurants and coffee shops have their own mini version (not as artsy and far from crowded) of First Friday activity. Little Saigon sits in the hub (if you will) of all things cool in DT Glendale. Alley way karaoke seems to be a common attraction. Most of the boutiques and antique shops do close up early so the most you will get is some interesting window shopping.  Fill yer flask, take a stroll.

I like to call Copper Star my home office away from my home office or even my main office from time to time. The connection is always solid and the staff is super friendly. I especially like setting up shop here on rainy days. I get my large van-latte, plug in, connect and bang out a full day's work and it doesn't even feel like work at all. It's a great place to meet up with a friend to play catch up, talk world events or even strategize. The art work is quit funky, too.  Aside from the great coffee, they make some pretty tasty sandwiches and salads. I really like the lemon ginger tuna salad sandwich because it's light and surprisingly filling and no-mayo. I prefer this vinaigrette based salad because really, who wants to bite into a mayonnaise sandwich?  It's also bike and dog friendly and they are really excitied about recycling.

This was the launch of our "Seven Summits" of Phoenix mountaineering adventure.  Our goal is to reach all of the seven summits by the end of April and we are off to a great start. Although it took us two attempts (two separate visits) to reach the summit, we did it with a few breaks and plenty of gasping along the way on New Years day. It was our way of starting the New Year on the more active side of things.  This hike really gave us a great work out with the steeper parts of the path allowing for a good sweat.  The trail is a continuous climb with a few resting spots and with plenty of photo ops to the summit. It does get pretty crowded and parking can be an issue on the weekends after the early hours. There are picnic tables, ramadas, restrooms and of course a stunning 360-degreee view once you reach the summit.

The crew at this location is very good. They're quick, thorough and will address redos without out any hesitation. I usually go with the Ultimate Package during the gentlemen's day special for $15 bucks. This package is the best deal  (Wednesdays for the guys) with a full wash, super coat,  extra hand dry, interior/trunk vacuum, interior/exterior windows, full interior and tire dressing plus air freshener of choice.  I've only experienced top notch service here and I've been pleased with the job these guys do.

We had a very difficult time finding trail 201 which was noted as one of the more strenuous hikes. We took trail 100 and came across some extreme mountain bikers, several other hikers and a couple who gave us confusing directions on how to reach one of the highest sections of the mountain. We got lost and ended trail busting which is highly discouraged but give us rules and we will break  em. During our run back down the trail I took a pretty hard fall face planting into the dirt, stabbing my right hand into a rock and banging up my knee. No broken bones or teeth, thankfully. We had just passed a couple of hikers when I took the fall so they saw everything. I laid there for about 10 seconds, jumped back up, noticed the blood, my torn tee and just continued on with the hike. We came across a park ranger who was standing outside his truck and asked if he had any medical supplies. Unfortunately, his first aid kit was about 20 years old and didn't contain anything that would help any of my wounds. We found a CVS on our way home and picked up some medical supplies and my wounds were washed and bandaged in the parking lot.   Probably my most memorable hike thus far.

The pizza is okay but unfortunately it does not make up for the wait time and fiasco of an ordering process. We were second in line to order, however it took longer than acceptable to be asked our slice selections then several minutes to actually receive our meal.  The price point is disappointingly higher than the quality of product with limited lunch specials.   Z Pizza is two blocks west with lunch specials running about a buck fifty less so I'll be sticking with them from here on out.

Getting into and out of this location is an absolute death trap because of the light rail construction course but I'll still continue to make the occasional shopping trip for my dry and produce goods.    And you won't get the hairy eye ball for sampling a grape or a piece of that tasty salt water taffy. The buttered popcorn flavor is my fave.

The initial hike to the paved portion of the trail is a bit strenuous. I'm sure a little pre hike stretching would have been good. I could have avoided the painful cramp a few feet up the incline; stupid me.  Once we hit the paved potion of the trail it was pretty steady. We continued to the side trail up to the radio towers had conversations about the city layout, identification of landmarks and the possibility of discovering a dead body. One of us thought the dead body discovery was a reality however, upon closer inspection found it to be nothing but a pile of boulders.  It was a good hike nonetheless.

Our first attempt to see a movie here was an epic fail on my part. Who'd a thunk you have to purchase your tickets in advance which allows you to pick your own cushy seats? What a nifty- brilliant idea, right?  I was like, drop me off here and I'll go buy the tickets while you park the car and he was like, you didn't pre-purchase our tickets (white eye stare)? And I was like, seriously, who pre-buys tickets on a Friday night as I exit the almost stopped car?  I high tail it to the counter praying to god and all the saints that there are two fantastic seats available. So I get to the ticket counter ever so confident still thinking I can score us some fantastic seats to a movie during opening week. But got the disingenuous - sorry all sold out instead. I politely but desperately asked her to "check again,' nope sorry. Maybe someone's cancelled?" She was like, no, sorry, still sold out. He shows up - almost out of breath from his post park jog. So, where are the tickets? And I was like...Well, Um, hmmm...and he was like,, Yeah... Pre-Purchase Tickets (white eye stare)!   So lesson learn, I pre-purchased our tickets to our follow-up movie and it was a fun experience. Great seats, good food, a couple rounds of cocktails and most importantly, NO CRYING BABIES!   Funny thing, we discovered the stow away food trays half way through the movie and we were so excited.   They even have movies...IN 3D.  We'll go again.

I took the free DASH today.  It was exactly what I expected but one should never complain when it's free.  The alternative was to sprint 9 blocks east in the 100+ scorching sun through skid row across a major intersection but today is not the day I want to die.  I hope my return trip is just as AC-comfortable and entertaining as the initial round of stop and Go.

Thank you ACE for making our recent dinning experience a great one.  You prepared our seafood selection that we had just purchased from Mekong Supermarket.....perfectly. Our tilapia was steamed with scallions, ginger and cilantro. Thank you for leaving the face on our fish. To some it's creepy but to us it was necessary. Our catfish was fried and seasoned with just the right amount of spice with tasty crunchy bits at the bottom of the plate. Our lobster was amazing! I don't recall the prep style we selected but it was painfully delicious.  We also selected a noodle option and steamed rice to accompany our meal.  A very very good meal prepared by very good people.  See you soon!

I've been for brunch and I've been for lunch but never for dinner until this past weekend and I'm giving high ratings for consistency and continuous good times. The cinnamon roll is to live for! Share it with a friend or be like me and eat the entire thing yourself- sugar belly!  The cocktails are great too, the bloody mary is savory and comes with all kinds of goodies - can be too spicy for me sometimes but I just pop an antacid and all is good.   Dinner this past weekend was just as great.  We were a large party but Francis was a saint and our table was ready on time without any delays.  Our server was also timely and most accommodating by not batting an eye at our request for separate checks. He made it seem like a fairly easy process even after we decided to play musical chairs, which would have burned my biscuits if I was in his shoes, for him, not a problem whatsoever.  I decided on the meatball dish and man were those balls meaty and the Moroccan spiced sauce was delicious. The dish comes with three hefty balls, saucy sauce, pearl pasta and I added the hen egg because it was an option at no cost.  I want to try the pork chop next. A friend suggested I do so. Every element about this place is great, the architecture, interior decor (rustically romantic), lighting, valet service and patio. All the elements that imo make for a great dinning experience.

Why for the love of God do people take small children to an adult movie and why oh why does the theater staff allow this to happen?! HOWEEEEEEVER!!!!! we are bluntly told we can't take in our Cold Stone waffle cone ice creams because of a new "outside food and drink" policy but these three small children can run and cry and scream throughout the entire movie.I hate you people!   I paid $10.50 for my entry ticket, $13 for a soda and popcorn and you ruined my hopes of escaping from reality for not even two hours.   Parents who poorly plan and ruin movie nights for other moviegoers can SUCK IT HARD !!!!and AMC, you get caught up in the crossfire for turning a blind eye.    I'm done with you and I want my money back!

My cousins were in town this past weekend and insisted we do some club crawling at West Gate. I was half sold on the idea as I had just returned home from NYC. I was exhausted and running on fumes but I agreed; with regrets of course.    Although the property is nice and the weather could not have been better I really don't know how people can afford to go out on the town. Every bar/restaurant had a cover charge and absolutely no drink specials to be found anywhere. Where I come from, 2-4-1 specials are the norm and you can always count on a shot special too. Not here! I was broke after 5 stops at 5 bucks a pop and a round of drinks costing me 25 to 35 bucks...I was so sticker shocked I couldn't even work up a slight buzz.   We also went to a club which I would say could qualify as uber-ghetto.  I've not seen that much twerking since...well, hmm never mind...Let's just say way more than what I need to see for a lifetime. These people were out of control. I was standing there with my group and it was so crowded, I was soaking wet from booze all the way down my back into my favorite leather loafers.  I even observed someone smash a glass in the middle of the dance floor and just kept right on dancing. This shiz was unbelievable.   Fast forward to the next morning, I discovered scratches on my calves and the back of my shirt was stained from what must have been vodka-crans, Jaeger bombs, big-butt beers (yes, they have those) and who knows what else. One things for sure, it wasn't my doing.    All I know is this was one big fat been-there-done-that for me. West Gate and your overpriced douchey establishments... no thank you, I'll stay put in my bubble.

You know there's a problem when the guys are separated from the ladies for pat downs and purse inspections at the front door. Was I being arrested or is this common check in practice at this establishment? The door staff seemed to find pleasure in bossing patrons around and may be taking their hostess authority a little too far. There's nothing special beyond the threshold here either. The venue, cocktail quality and staff all tragically fail. The only glimmer of hope rests on the ghetto-tastic music that leads to contagious head boppin' & bootty shakin'.  The music was great and is the only reason why I give two stars but I don't plan on ever returning.

I have fallen head over heels in love with the Nearly Naked Theatre (aka N2T)! It consists of a team of local writers, actors, and technicians whose mission is to deliver entertaining theater free of censorship and corporate/political constraints. Although the theatre is small (seats 75 or so) and the sets are creatively homegrown, the writing and acting are extraordinary. I've seen Metamorphosis, Reefer Madness, The Rocky Horror Show, M. Butterfly, and Time Square Angel all in the last year and thoroughly enjoyed each and every one. I'm a huge fan and want you to be one too. So check out season 10's show schedule and support our local arts. See you at the show!

I was in a mad search to find Cock & Bull Ginger Beer during the holidays and come to find out Bevmo was the only place I could find that carries it. Unfortunately, it took multiple calls to different locations to find any in stock. Evidently, there is a guy out there who was one step ahead of me and is buying out the entire supply.  Either I need to off the competition or we need to become friends. But really, I'm more interested in dibs on the supply. So my last call was to this BevMo location and I was happy to hear they had plenty in stock and will continue to carry it with shipments every Thursday.   BevMo, I really heart you for carrying our number one choice of ginger beer which allowed me to put together the best Moscow Mule gift package. You also taught me what a jigger was. How could I have been so stupid?   Cock & Bull Moscow Mule: 32 oz Mason Jar (fill with Ice cubes) 2 Jiggers vodka   1/2 fresh squeezed Lime Top off with Cock & Bull Ginger Beer  Enjoy!

Thanks to Thomas for recommending 180 Degrees Auto. Inc. I was very satisfied with the service and the pricing was better than I expected.  I can now begin to trust the auto service industry again knowing Bogi & team are looking out for me and my car's best interest. I found the180 Degrees team to be knowledgeable, informative, customer focused, professional, caring and honest.  Here's why?  1. I was offered a ride home when I set my appointment and again when I checked my car in.  Dealers don't even offer this anymore!  2. I was promised only services needed would be suggested. Promise kept! 3. I received an informative and helpful phone consultation prior to picking up my car after it was serviced. Bogi went over the findings and suggested future maintenance. 4. Once I got to the shop I received a full write up of the suggested maintenance that would improve my car's performance/life span. The write-up even included prices and suggested dates. 5. I was surprised and very happy to receive a new customer special diagnostic check. I did not expect it, but the gesture made an impression that my business was appreciated.  6. Best of all, the shop recently relocated a few blocks from my house.    I will definitely be back for future service and trust 180 degrees Auto Inc with my vehicle.    Now if I can just find a trustworthy body shop to fix the dent left in my bumper by a hit and run driver! A-hole plowed right into me, backed up, and sped away!

It has been a hell of a work week and  Friday could not have come any sooner. This week was rough especially with the announcement that we are officially in a recession and the ambiguity was hitting me from all sides. Man, did I need some distraction from all my worries. So the BF (Bacon) and I decided on Thai but wanted to venture out from the norm and we are very glad we did.   The Thai Hut exceeded our expectations. We were a little skeptical at first with so many lackluster reviews but we hit the jackpot on our night. This place has a great vibe! We were seated immediately and staff was beyond courteous and attentive.  We were approached by a few staff members which gave us the feeling of true teamwork.  Our server was attentive and even sparked up some conversation throughout our meal.   We started with a hot pot of Chicken Tom Kha Kai and this soup hit the spot. My worries were vanishing with every spoonful. They say Chicken Soup will cure a cold and that Menudo will feed a hangover. Well, I now believe Tom Kha Kai is the cure for the blues because it sure made me happy! For our main dish we shared the Red Chicken Curry. A little heavy on the red and green peppers but very tasty and was the perfect match with the soup.   So we will definitely  be back and will be sharing this place with some of our closest friends. I've already made lunch plans for next Wednesday.

Pappadeaux and Mammadeaux too~ This place is kicken for Happy Hour Mon-Fri 3pm to 6pm with crazy good food at great prices. Start off with the Blackened Oyster Fondue (under $10), Cold Boiled Shrimp (under $5), Fried Alligator (under $5) and a tall Blue Moon or Swamp Thing! The place packs up around 5ish and the Happy Hour prices only apply to the bar area. A band plays every Friday starting at 6. Good times!  The main restaurant is a great place for groups, however, can be a little loud for intimate dates. The menu is extensive with a lot of great choices.  Check out the website for menu details.

I met a couple friends here last Wednesday night. This place has a calm vibe to it.  The decor is modern but the strategically placed candles/lighting, fire pit, and Latin World Music playing in the background give this place a warm European feel. I did not get to see much of the inside.  Check out the web-site's slide show.  I tried South American beer for the first time. Very good! And we split a Bruschetta plate. Also very good!    If you want to enjoy a great place with a great patio (before the scorching heat hits) then get over to Bomberos.   I will do this place again and again!

Our hike up to the towers began at the trail just south of the visitor center. This portion of the trail, about a mile or so, was mostly flat through the desert and allowed us to get in a great jog before reaching the base. Trail markers are not clear and there are a few options up to the towers, some easy and some difficult. We had to ask a few hikers along the way if we were on the right path heading in the right direction.  We were pointed in the direction of the difficult hike which of course we took. So up we went steady, resting and short bursting all the way up to the towers.  We reached the towers, rested for a bit, took in the view and began our descent on the opposite side of the mountain.  The north potion of the slope led us back to the flat-lands and yet another sprint/jog to the visitor center were we came upon a group people in a T'ai Chi session. That was nice.    Tip: This is a great hike if you want to include some sprint/jog activity.  Hike Length: 5 miles round trip Difficulty: Moderately strenuous   Facilities: Water, restrooms and a very nice visitor center with staff.

I make every effort to visit Yen Sushi & Sake as much as possible and it's the primary place I select when wanting to introduce to first timers. As a regular, I've yet to have an experience that was less that stellar and my recent dinner date was just that; stellar indeed.  We checked in slightly before the 5pm happy hour which allowed us prompt attention both on our drink and dinner selections. We got started with Sake Bombs ,went lightly on the dramatics that precede your typical bomber activity but a prefect lead in to getting nicely loosened up for the big meal- Cheers~ I had talked up this meal for some time so I was just a tad anxious about every thing going just perfect. We were off to a good start.  It didn't take us long to decide on our selections and since we were both in an adventurous mood, we opted for something raw, something baked, something fried and something grilled. It's a good thing we were hungry too.  Our selections included a small sashimi sampler which we were allowed to sub out one of the preselected items for tuna titaki. We were both glad we did and it was super cool of them to accommodate without any fuss. The platter was insanely plentiful, fresh and we enjoyed every sampling. We decided on the Hamachi Kama for our grilled item. It was also tasty. Our fried item was the Heart Attack, a cream cheese stuffed jalapeño - one of my faves. Our last item was the baked salmon roll, I think. You see my Sake Bomb glass never went empty so that last item was bit of a blur. What wasn't a blur was the overall meal and the great time we had. I'm confident my dinner date would echo this as well.  The only lesson learned for the next visit is to space out the ordering of the items just a bit. We ordered all selections at the same time and with this much food we could have eased into each plate vs. hitting them all at once - My personal preference entirely.   I'm working on plans for a return visit and many more to follow.

I'm not a girl or a drag queen but if I were, I would Shop Devious for all my wigs and accessories. They got vintage, old fashioned candy, wigs galore, scarves, bangles, a type writer, hats, a bowling ball, some men's stuff and much much more. The prices are unbelievable. You'll find yourself asking, is this the right price?  My gal pal found a cool purse for $6 bucks. Ah hello, like WOW! This place is way off the beaten path and I love it.  My loves grown deeper for this little shop of fabulous finds as they were hosts of this month's First Friday Bake for Hope event (breast cancer charity).  This gesture says a lot about a retailer and I will spread the word about this goodness.   So get your arse over to Shop Devious and buy something, anything. Just go already!

The Queen Creek Olive Mill is the perfect outing if you're looking for something new to do or if you're hosting out of town guests. It's located approximately 45 miles from downtown Phoenix on the edge of Queen Creek. Allow for at least 2 hours to spend at the QCOM, which can be filled with the 30-minute tour, sampling, lunch, shopping, or just hanging out with a bottle of wine at one of thee seating areas available. One inside the store/café, an umbrella covered patio, or the picnic benches shaded by the olive trees. The Café offers breakfast specials, sandwiches, paninis, soups, salads, bruschetta, gelato, and special wines. The store sells a variety of olive oils, stuffed olives, cremas, and tapenades made from olives grown/harvested from the local grove.      Recommended items. -Burnt Mozzarella Bruschetta (3); melted mozarella, roasted garlic, and a tasty oregano pesto- burnt to perfection!     -Mushroom Bruschetta (3); wild mushrooms, herbs, and caramelized onions-  A generous mix of shrooms and onions.  -Mansi Panini; Tequila lime roasted chicken, fontina , sun dried tomato, parmesan tapenade and tomato parmesan crema: comes with a side of olives and chips.   The tour: An educational guide on how the olives are grown, harvested, and processed.   The complimentary sampling bar includes a variety of: Olive Oils: about 10 to taste from- surprising twist were the vanilla bean, blood orange, and lemon infused olive oils.  Tapenades: 7 to taste from - My fav was the caramelized onion and fig  Stuffed Olives: About a dozen to taste from - All were great but my top two were the Oregano feta and Vermouth garlic stuffed olives.  The olives, olive oils, and tapenades sold on site are great gift ideas for folks looking for Arizona made products. Will be adding a few to my x-mas list.   Our trip to the Olive Mill was very enjoyable and we'll be adding it to our must see AZ places for our visiting friends and family.

I've been to Maizie's several times and the food is consistently good. Monday's are pretty bustling for the $3 burger plate and wine specials. It's chaotic but well worth the madness considering the deal. The wingless buffalo dip is one of my favorite plates and we've even been able to duplicate the recipe for a few of our own house parties. Another highlight is Maizie's Sunday Brunch. The red chili is awesome and so are $3 Mimosas & Bloody Mary's. We recently tried the Tuesday Fish Fry which was also great. Plenty of fried fish, a hefty serving of fries, two hush puppies and a creamy corn tartar sauce. The Half Baked dessert (warm cookie with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream) is the perfect ending to any meal and enough to share with at least two others.   Additional high marks go for location (walking distance from the Central & Camelback light rail stop), patio seating (especially this time of year), wine punch card club (buy 5 glasses and your 6th is free. SCORE!) and the beer and wine selection. Service on a normal night is always great. Not so easy breezy on Monday nights or during the mad rush for Sunday Brunch. Certainly not a deal breaker for me, I've got a wine punch card and two more glasses gets me a freebie.

Yelpers get it right again!   The SO and I decided on Salad and Pizza before settling in for a night of disk 1, season 3 of WEEDS.  So we head over to Pizza A Metro after a quick yelp search and cruise through the "wes-side" of Phoenix.  Pulled up to a mini-strip mall with a Circle K and a unisex hair salon which created great interest for us because we love "off the beaten path" kind of places.   We step in, notice a very clean interior with a very nice staff too-boot.Take a gander at the menu and decide on the Antipasto della Casa for starters and the Frescolina fresh Pizza. As we're waiting for our Antipasto, we're served warm flat bread and a spread that appeared to be onions, olives, and peppers. It was great! We were again greeting by the owner who exchanges small talk throughout our night adding to our great evening out.  The Antipasto was an amazing array of olives, peppers, basil, fresh mozzarella, prosciutto,and eggplant. It was almost too pretty to eat and more than enough for the two of us.   Next was the Frescolina Pizza. Man this was one killer pizza! Tomato, mozzarella, prosciutto, and arugula, the perfect layer of flavor. The sweetness of the sauce, saltiness of the prosciutto, and the peppery/bitterness of the arugula made for a perfect blend. Wait, the crust! This crust was beyond real and there were no ends left on our plates.  Now that's great crust!  So we both agreed this was one hell-of-a place and we are going to be making our way through the menu along with our standing date with our next in queue Netflix-flick!

This location is a bit smaller than the West Side store but just as clean and offering the same variety of sweets. The ladies who work the counter are always in the best of moods and on this visit even remembered my usual order.  I was exceptionally famished as I was post hike and really needed to fill my tank so I tore right into that red chili burrito right there in the parking lot. If you want fresh off the belt (hot to the touch) tortillas, you'll have to go to the WS location. Bring your own butter!  No Cards- Cash Only

Wow, this store ranks high in cleanliness, organization and product. I found a new rechargeable Ipod speaker that I'll be tethering to my bike, a fancy casserole dish that was used for a post Thanksgiving brunch chorizo con papas dish and lots and lots of other great stuff. That same rechargeable speaker was on Target's shelf for $30 but I got it for $16. They also had plenty of my favorite Calvin Klein undies in stock but unfortunately not one pack in my size and there is no way I'm squeezing my frank & buns into a size 32. Macy's sells those same skivvies for $24 but I can score two packs at that price. Oh yeah I'll be back.

This is a New York style deli with meats sliced to order with a wide variety of hero options and daily specials.   Hours are 6am to 5pm M-F  If you work or live in the downtown area near 1st Ave & Adams, you've gotta try the Hero Factory. I'm making my way through the menu one hero at a time with a visit at least once a week and enjoying every bite of it too.  These are honestly the best hero subs I have ever had in my life. The portions are huge, enough to share with a friend.  Not only is the food awesome but the people who run this shop are very cool. They put a lot of heart into every meal they serve with great appreciation.  Need a recommendation?  Try the Godfather- Italian meats on toasted garlic bread...It's to live for!

Besides being a good taco/burrito/lemonade stand, THBH is imo the coolest club house on the block. It's chock-full of knickknacks, posters, and snarky signage that will keep you occupied while waiting for your order. I wasn't even bothered by the lingering smell of lavender incense, plenty of which to select from. I purchased opium and cherry. Nope, never gonna burn em; impulse buy. The side patio is a great spot to sit and munch on 2 dollar tacos while being windblown by industrial coolers and misting systems. I love it. Tonight's attraction, Poetry Slam, and man this was one slam jam. Note to self, take up ripping people to shreds by way of organized angry verbal release. Possible new found therapy. My mental first draft in play as a sit sipping on a paper parasol topped watermelon lemonade. In sum, I find one word that describes this jaunt, E-CLECTIC! Beats the heck out of drive-thru any day.

Z-Pizza (and Carlos) came through for me in a big way during a recent late night work day. I was going on my 13th hour at the office and my hunger pangs were really getting the best of me and the only thing I had in my overhead was a couple sleeves of instant oatmeal and a pack of Cup O' Noodles. I'm soo tired of oatmeal for dinner and I wasn't feeling the Cup O' Noodles either.  My office is downtown so late night delivery options are almost non-existent and being that I was on command center duty, I could not leave my post so it had to be delivery or nada.  Sad thing is, most of the eateries in my downtown nook roll up pavement between 8 and 9pm.  After calling all my favorite daytime eateries (that were still open at 9pm)which either don't offer delivery or stopped delivery at 8pm, I was just about to give up and settle for those expired sleeves of the oatmeal when I thought to give Z-Pizza a try. Sure glad I did! Technically they too were no longer delivering for the night but Carlos was so nice and said he would do it for me. I had my order in and it was delivered within 20 minutes. My salad was crisp and cold and my pasta & meatballs were piping hot. Carlos was just as friendly in person as he was on the phone and thanks to Z-Pizza I was a happy well fed man.

Everything about this place is out of the norm in a very good and inviting way. Major points on the curb appeal from rock wall to innovative use of nostalgic wooden letter blocks as signage. The attention to detail is refreshing and appreciated.  The interior is welcoming and the creative use of space is impressive. How does one fit a lounge, bar and dinning area in such a tight space and mitigate claustrophobia? This is worthy of an HGTV episode.  Tuck has done it & done it well!   The menu is just as creative and unique in its own right. I've enjoyed the roasted grape crostini, chorizo stiffed dates, mac & cheese w/lobstah, special meatloaf with potatoes & chorizo and the chocolate cheese cake. All hit high marks for flavor, portion and presentation. The service is consistently impeccable from courteous host to attentive but non-intrusive servers. I always feel welcomed and appreciated!    Tuck Shop is in my top five places I love and enjoy introducing to friends, co-workers, and out of town guests. It holds a very warm place in my heart with many fun and special memories.

At first I was uncomfortable, nervous, and for a few seconds forgot why were there in the first place. Unfamiliar places tend do this to me and I'm sure it's a disorder of some sort. So as my eyes adjusted to the dark lit space, I began to admire the wood floors, exposed brick, pulsating light fixtures, and swanky euro furniture. Then my eyes were transfixed on the sparkle behind the bar. Each bottle of booze glistened like fresh cut jewels and was displayed with precise intention to tempt and I wanted them all! Although many of the people sitting at the bar were drinking canned beer PBR to be exact. This is a cool bar and I wanted a cool drink and the choice was a dirty martini. So as we sipped our drinks and moved from one side of the bar to the other and back again admiring every detail. We nodded our heads in approval and  departed delightfully impressed with the outcome of the long awaited Side Bar. A spot we will visit again and again.

Striving to do something different from the norm, we decided to hop on the freeway and give midnight bingo a try.  We had no idea it was Bad Bingo or glow stick night, however, we were far from  prepared for what we were about to experience. The bingo ballroom was insane, like a crazy weeding slash high school reunion slash underground disco and every social reject was invited and brought a plus one. It was crazy times two and I loved every single moment of it. They had karaoke, raffles, people dancing on chairs, bachelorette parties, free birthday spankings, and MCd by a highly energetic ball of wild. Queue up The Electric Slide and the dance floor exploded.  The room is 750 maximum occupancy and I think they were pretty close if not at the max.    Bingo was fantastic, fun and peppered with just the right amount of naughty when bingo ball O/69 was called.  We didn't win any bingo games but the  3 hours and 30 bucks invested was well worth it all.   We hit the slots and my friend won $100 dollars. We cashed out, ate breakfast and headed home just before the break of dawn.   I'd totally go again.

I was quite proud that I starved myself three entire meals before heading here for brunch. It was a friend's birthday and I had not been to Crackers& Co in over 10 years. Being familiar with the menu, I decided earlier in the week that I would venture back memories' lane for a few of my faves.    I started with a cup the Cream of Spinach and Artichoke soup which taste exactly how I remembered it from back in the day. Still hot, still savory, still delish! My friend and I split the Banana Cream Pie Pancakes and I could have honestly died right there right then. So good!  For my main meal I ordered the Country Fried Steak Biscuits and Gravy. The steak was very tasty and the country potatoes were griddle fried to perfection.   I made it half way through my main meal and decided to pump the brakes and suggested we split the daily bread pudding special but the response I got was, You! Can't! Be! Serious!  So we decided to save that for another time.   Later that night I had the other portion of my breakfast for dinner. I slept well.

We started off hiking towards the main summit, veered a little off course then decided to hike back down and took the side trail to the western summit. That portion of our hike required some climbing up and a lot of crawling down. Note, there are some steep sections along the trails and a lot of loose rock throughout the entire park. The thrill in this hike was not knowing if we were on or off trail at times which I'll say only added to the hike.  Once I made it to the peak of the western summit we continued on to the main summit which was a super easy hike. We reached that summit pretty quickly, sat for a bit, sang a couple songs, took in the view and then hiked back down.  Tips: Early morning arrival guaranteed us a great parking spot. The difficulty descriptor reads, strenuous but only a half mile to the summit. I didn't notice any restrooms, a horse trough, volleyball courts or a playground as detailed in the information I printed.  I think the information is outdated but the peaks were definitely located where the map indicated and that's all that mattered to us.

El Hefe and I were initially on our way to the fleet of food trucks but then discovered our days were off. Food Trucks are on Wednesdays and today was Tuesday. What a mixer-roo!   El Portal would have to do, an unfortunate to do at that.  The service is deplorable! The counter expediter was a hot mess. He even addressed me as "Hey You" when my order was ready.  Seriously, what the "Number 2" is up with that?!  The gals that were behind us in line were treated with an even lower grade of service. Now that didn't make me feel special at all.    I ordered the two (chicken) taco combo and only one taco contained any meat product.  I left hungry.  No bueno: (

I'll start by yelling, MORE PASTA PLEASE!... and that's a good thing because the dish I had was insanely delicious. I ordered the Chitarra alla Carbonara with Guanciale. Man-o- man was it good. Thanks to Kevin H for my new found addiction; Guanciale! You Rule!  Now back to the review... If I were rating my entire experience on the pasta alone, you would see 5 stars. However, in order to get there I feel a few tweaks are needed to land on perfection. First, the local greens salad I had was way overly salted and a bit meager in my opinion. A little less on the salt and throw in a few shavings of Parmigiano and you got a winner. Second, I feel the pricing structure is little steep for the lunch crowd and may be the reason why my co-worker and I were the only ones in the place during the 11am lunch hour on a Tuesday. Consider a price adjustment to attract the lunch crowd and you're sure to draw them in.  My bill with tip was $24.66 for the salad, tea, and pasta. Lastly, and I second Alexander's plea. Where's the freaking bread!  I could not believe I had to give up my bowl with a pool of deliciousness still left at the bottom. The drippings alone could feed a family of three. It was criminal.  I mentioned my disappointment to our server who kindly said there were no plans to serve bread with pasta dishes, the cracker sticks is all they were serving. Ditch the cracker sticks man and get with the program. I begged with him to make it happen and was a bit dramatic while conveying this request.  He must have got the message because 10 min later he came back to our table saying that the kitchen staff was working on a plan to serve bread with the pasta dishes. I promised a return visit to validate the change and I look forward to reporting back.  Wishin' and Hopin' and Thinkin' and Prayin' la,la, la, la~

Possibly the worst meal I've ever had at a restaurant. I was expecting much more considering the quaint interior and white linen draped table tops but I was deceived; royally!  First Course: A veggie egg roll that was over fried a few minutes too long. The only veggie I could identify was a piece of broccoli, the rest, unsure.  I had the feeling (by taste) that the egg roll was taken directly out of the freezer and thrown into an extremely high temp deep fryer. The bed of cole slaw that the egg roll sat upon lacked any acidity or taste. Even worse, the egg roll and slaw were served on a damaged serving plate. The plate was cracked!   Second Course: Cucumber and tomato salad, hummus and pita bread. The salad was missing any trace of vinaigrette or fragrant herbs. Just a bowl of cut up tomatoes and sliced cucumbers; no seasoning. The texture on the cucumbers was slightly slimy, possibly starting to turn. The hummus had a gritty texture (I like it creamy) as though the olive oil was omitted.   Main Course: A total disaster! Risotto or rice pilaf wrapped in a skirt steak, pan fried, and served on  a bed of Spanish rice. My steak was impossible to cut with a steak knife and the middle was blood red. I had one bite and could not get another piece as the steak was to tough The Spanish rice tasted like it was cooked without any seasoning then was over seasoned before being served. I did notice the unfinished plates of other customers who were having the same meal. I could tell this was not a fan favorite. Unfortunate.   Dessert: We had the server box it up to go. Never ate it.    I would like to note that the co-owner did approach us about our untouched meals and asked us if we would share some feedback. I  expressed my disappointment with the dinner providing detail of what was wrong with every item.  He seemed surprised with my candidness. I then asked him if he had ever tried the meal to which he responded, "No, I'm a very picky person."  He was very apologetic and gave us 10% off the bill and asked us to come back. He mentioned there were some changes being made to the menu and that he would discuss our feedback with the cook. We then had to drive to the ATM up the block to get cash to pay for our meal because their credit card machine was out of service. One catastrophe after another.

After finding ourselves lost in a dry riverbed along the freeway, David and I decided to give in and call our early morning hike a done deal.  Our planned destination was Piestewa Peak but we were off course, so way off course.  After running around aimlessly for a bit, posing for pics and climbing a small hill we headed to Luci's for breakfast. We were really looking forward to it as it was a first visit for the both of us. The space is really cool, interesting products, great layout, a cool diner counter and super friendly staff. All that being said, my meal (egg Sammy on asiago bagel) was average and fell just a tad short of my expectations considering the anticipation and how great it read on the menu.  On a brighter side, David was thrilled with his "special request" latte. Evidently there are restrictions on allowable ounces on coffee products sold. He had his heart set on a super size big gulp version of a latte and the staff being super accommodating allowed for this "one time" exception and in my eyes a redeeming point lost on my Sammy.  Luci, for this I grant you back the lost point and a promise to return in the near future.  Thank you.

I jump at the chance to share a meal whenever I dine with a friend who is also willing to do so. It's not only fun but helps me control my portions and is way easier on the dinning budget. I usually ask the server if sharing a meal would also be filling enough to satisfy us and I usually emphasizes...we are starving!  Our server was eager to help us select our dishes.  The Parlor Insalata was a great starter and more than enough for us. It was a large bowl of Mixed Greens/Salami/Feta/Olives/Cucumber/Tomatoes/ Crispy Chickpeas /Red Onion and an Oregano Vinaigrette.  We went with the 12" Margherita, he wanted pepperoni added to his side of the pizza. He tried one slice without pepperoni and I tried one with. We both agreed all pepperoni next time. Washed it down with a couple beers.  Nom nom tasty.   We were both very pleased with our meals with 3 extra slices left over; I was gifted the take-away box.

I shopped local for 95% of my holiday gifts and my Smeeks recipients absolutely loved their trinkets and candy.  I love Smeeks for how it made me feel. Just like a kid in a candy store and I wanted to sniff and lick everything. I had a great time perusing all the cool merch and even found a couple things for myself. I'm sure I'll be granted a few cool points for my Pac Man mints and root beer scented pencil. Hmmm I could use a Baby Jesus topper for my pencil, Stevey?    They even have plastic barf. How can you not visit this place?

It looked like shrimp and it taste like shrimp but it wasn't shrimp. It looked like chicken and it taste like chicken but it wasn't chicken. It was all tofu and 100% vegan AND it was all amazingly great.  Even Amy's mock pork was surprisingly very pork like and I love pork.  You see, I love meat and it's very seldom that I go a day without meat in any given deal. However, this full "mock" meat experience was pretty cool and enlightening.  Not only was the lil establishment very clean but the owner was super cool and informative.  Although I don't see myself converting to full veganism anytime soon, I'll definitely be back to try a few more vegan-mock meat dishes.  Boba Juice is also my new go to place for a much needed icy cold smoothie with boba of course. I've tried a few variations and my favorite is the taro/coconut smoothie, add boba.  I swung by Boba three days in a row for a smoothie and that's a pretty solid indicator that I like the place.  Yay, I am a fan!

Mekong Supermarket is impressively clean and organized.  I could walk through the store without tripping over product containers and without the overwhelming smell of dried shrimp.  I was also impressed with the layout and condition of the live/frozen seafood section.  The frozen case was extremely organized and the product descriptions were visible and easy to read.  The live seafood tanks were full and appeared to be well maintained.  As for the prices, they were very reasonable and lower compared to other markets.  We had specific weight requirements for our seafood so we were a little high maintenance for the staff but they were willing to accommodate to the best of their ability. Our selection for the day was a live lobster, tilapia and catfish. All needed to be no greater than 2lbs which we approximately met with the help of the staff.  Our tilapia and catfish were cleaned and bagged while our lobster traveled live with us over to Asian Café Express where we had our seafood selection prepared for our meal.  Mekong and ACE have an agreement that allows customers to select their seafood product then ACE will prepare it to a selected style for a small fee. This was a first and enjoyable experience for me. Something I would do again - most definitely.

Nothing makes me happier than to visit a new establishment that over delivers on all points that matter to me.  I was a loyal fan of Lisa G. and was heartbroken to see her leave. However, I've made way for TMI to fill the void and as the song goes, My Heart Will Go On.  The charming Sheridan bungalow takes on a new life with a new menu, new decor, new staff and a  great experience for you to enjoy.    The ambiance is perfect if you are, as I am, one for dim lit places that play old school/neo-soul/hip hop beats while chilling with a group of friends. The interior space is relaxed and the furniture very comfy.   The Drink Menu has something for everyone. Wine, draft, maybe a cocktail. My choice, the Four Peaks Hefe and a sip of a friend's dirty martini.     The menu options are great and the prices even better. Although I only had the soup, I snuck a bite of Bacon's grilled cheese sandwich and Ayesha's mac & cheese. Both were amazing and I can't wait to go back for more. The staff was extremely friendly and timely even though the place was bustling. Our table had 11 people on separate checks but our server didn't even bat an eye. Cash out, easy breezy!   Thanks TMI, I'm a fan.

I'm loving the Cochata so much that I swung by twice this past weekend. Whoever came up with this coffee and horchata concoction is a genius.  Now I only wish America offered a soyrizo breakfast burrito. Will you please do this for me and all the soyrizo lovers in the Melrose?   Thanks in advance.

I was a guest of a friend who was hosting a family style dinner on Arabian night which included live traditional Arabic/Iraqi music and belly dancers.  I will start by saying although I was a guest; I was made to feel just like part of the family and was told I was going to have a great time, which I most certainly did. Our evening started with an Arabic serenade and the tempo progressed throughout the evening. Our dinner was family style so I didn't order off the menu which I was perfectly fine with. The Lebanese dinner included a salad, piles of pita bread, hummus, babaghanouj, dipping oils, a fried appetizer platter, Beef/ Chicken Shawarma and rice.  I enjoyed all the food and the host ensured my plate was constantly replenished which was a welcomed gesture.  I devoured every helping.   During dinner we were entertained by belly dancers who captivated the entire restaurant.  These dancers were quite talented and had everyone out of their seat dancing and throwing handfuls of money at them. It was magical.   Aside from the great entertainment, I was pulled out to the dance floor and participated in a traditional group dance- everybody was dancing in their traditional belly dancing style.  I had no reservations showing off my best Shakira inspired "hips don't lie" moves.  I fit right in.  After the dance, we all took a break to enjoy some Hookah out on the patio provided by Hookah Mania which is hip hookah lounge located next door. This wasn't a dream. It really happened.

The crew at this store is not one bit customer friendly. They seemed more interested in throwing out the trash and banging pans together than assembling my foot long.  I was adrenaline happy and just off a good solid hour of the best cardio in weeks. My expectations are not even close to a dog a pony show but could you have at least acknowledged my obvi existence.  Aint coming back period

The corporate rate I scored on the Platinum package is amazing! It includes parking, access to all locations, all classes, tanning,  unlimited bring a guest/workout buddy, towels, and 20% of clothing for less than $18 a month with no enrollment fee (w/annual free). That is over 50% lower than what I was quoted when they first opened. I'm glad the fees have been adjusted to my benefit.   This allows me to steal away during my lunch hour and get in one of the core classes or complete a circuit session. I can almost do three tri pull-ups without the raiser...baby steps.   The facility itself is very nice, machines are all operable, plenty of help from staff and trainer consulting. My favorite feature is the cardio cinema. Burn major cals while watching an action movie, that time goes by so fast. I've not tried the tanning capsule but I plan on being rotisserie golden brown by Independence Day.    My only minor complaint is with the lockers. There are no hooks and or shelves in the lockers leaving me to pile all belongings at the bottom and makes for a quick change into and out of my work out gear a pain.   Since joining,  I've referred 4 of my colleagues for the same rate and this should secure me at least four years of  waived annual fees. I'll be asking.

The best Moscow Mule in town. It's gotta be ginger beer and we don't need a fancy copper mug; just give us the Duce Jar.  Two rounds will do ya good.  For what it's worth, I don't care how many rounds I have, I don't see myself ever spending $58 on a graphic tee. That's just nuts~

Five stars for having the best meal value with recreational outlet during the lunch hour.  Your lunch outing will get you a great meal and a free game of bowling for only $5.50. Srsly!  I've done the lunch & bowl three times and each visit was easy breezy, just stick to the following:  Most people are there during their lunch hour so show up a little early to guarantee access to the next available lane. Sign up for your lane immediately upon arrival and order your meal as soon as your server checks in with you. Keep your game going and avoid stalling and lingering. Believe me, two players can get through a game and lunch within 45 minutes. Most importantly, just have fun!

A week's supply of fresh crisp dress shirts runs me just under $13 and it is well worth every penny and a much needed time saver. I use to enjoy pressing and starching my own shirts but not any more. I leave that to the experts at American Cleaners.  They are great to work with. I walk in, hand over my bag of dirties, ask a random alteration question as if I'm every going to actually have anything altered,  pay my fee, and I'm out the door.  My pick-ups always look and feel brand new.

I've been told having Five Guys is way better a fantasy than a reality and in this case, I have to disagree. It's taken me a few months to give in to the temptation of having one of those juicy double patty-bacon- cheese oozing all over the place- grilled jalapenos- sautéed onion burgers. I admit, it's taken me way too long to indulge and today was the day I took the grease soaked brown bag plunge.  There is no way that really good tasting burger was in any way good for me. I will note, I did have a diet coke and shared the fries.   I will be attending a back to back group exercise class tonight. There, see, all better.

It's pre Saint Patrick's day and everyone in the building is eating corned beef and cabbage. I think corned beef tastes like Alpo smells and cabbage gives me bubble guts so I opt out for Cajun.  I stroll up Central Avenue soft breeze in my face sun kissed all the way and I pass a couple friends returning from where I'm heading, Food Truck Friday, oh yeah!  The Jamburrito truck had the longest line of the fleet which only made my cravings for Cajun much-more stronger. I was torn between the chicken jambalaya bowl and the fried catfish jamburritto. The guy ahead of me in line was raving about the catfish and that was all the indirect intervention I needed to make my decision. The fried catfish jamburrito is a girthy handful and loaded with chunks of freshly fried catfish, jambalaya rice, Cajun tartar, black bean salsa, shredded jack cheese and shredded lettuce.  I call it Cajun Gold!  I added on an order of hushpuppies because I'm cool like that.

This place looks like a bag of skittles and smells like toasty pop tarts and is the best spot to pick up a gift for your girlfriend or a friend that so happens to be a girl.   My gal pal and I recently took a detour into Charming Charlie on our way to Happy Hour and she went absolutely bonkers. I call it the pin ball effect.  She was able to methodically cover the entire store and make it to the cashier with two nifty bags, two pair of sandals, a dress and an extremely large hat in just under 20 minutes. I teased her about scoping out the joint on a previous visit but she insists she was born to shop. She was quite the pro and all smiles post check out.   It's moments like this that remind me that happiness can be bought.  I prefer to get my happy at the bar across the way.

Coffee, Tea, Soda Pop, vodka PLEASE!  Yes, it is true; Josh is a rock star behind the bar and is super sweet to-boot. I was in the mood for something muddled and citrusy and his recommendations were spot on.  I really dig the vibe this little gem has to offer. It's intimate with a punch of coolness and although not an unfamiliar concept, they definitely deliver it in their own unique style. Great menu, various drink options, dog friendly, great staff and a drive up window....I like it. I like it a lot.   Will return- Most def!

Aya Dioscito, I couldn't love this place any more than I do right now. And that's a lot of love and I mean it.  I am working my way through every menu item and this weekend I will have the Platillo de Carne Asada Y Nopal and a taco de tripa. I'm not one for tripe but everything I've had here is absolutely delicious and I'm trusting I will have a breakthrough and resolve my fear of the tripe. I hear one must have it extra crispy.   I'm really excited. Butterflies in my belly excited..... like that first time when...

I was running two hours late to my little brother's birthday celebration when I realized I had forgotten to pick up a card (oh so very typical of me). Unfortunately I had already passed my favorite little local boutique and had no time to back track out my way then back to the freeway again. This I'm sure would have put me an additional hour behind and would have guaranteed a subtle 'ha ha, we are so glad you could make it" scolding from the fam.   So I run into Hallmark quickly scan the shelves for the marker reading BIRTHDAY - For HIM section and I grab a few and begin my speedy process of elimination.  Honestly, these cards never read exactly how I feel. So I go with one of the singing, animated pop-up cards, grab a gift bag, and high tail it to the register.   The cashier was super nice and offered to help put my gift together and even suggested I take a seat to fill out the card. They have a side table with chair right next to the register which I found to be a great idea if one has time to sit and ponder up something inspiring to write in a card. I usually just let the card speak for itself and just sign the darn thing. She encouraged me to take a quick minuet and fill it out - "come on write something from the heart". So I complied and I was glad I did. There I sat stared into space and began to think about how much my little brother meant to me.  Ugh!!!!! Leave it to me to get all mushy sentimental in a Hallmark store. They even have tissue available but I didn't cry.   Thank you Hallmark girl for helping me express some brotherly love to my youngest.  I made it to his birthday party, he opened his gift, read the card and we hugged it out in a sports bar. My other brother's birthday is in March. I'll need some help with that one.

My friend Michael invited me as his guest to last night's session with Serina and I am so glad I committed. I got one heck of a workout and enjoyed every minuet of it. The studio is well kept, music was awesome and the instructor was an absolute sweetheart. Her positive energy was contagious; she connected with the class and kept the momentum going for the full hour.  I bought the package deal and I can't wait to "burn-off" through my 20 classes. WEPA!

After mastering the art of Debka (traditional Arab folk dance) at Mijana, we skipped on over to Hookah Mania for a brief introduction and to request another round of ocean berry mint.  I was asked if I wanted "in" on a card game that was about to start. These guys looked pretty serious about the game so I declined. I told them I wasn't familiar with the game and that I didn't have the attention span to last beyond the first hand.  They chuckled and continued on with the deal. We then walked over to meet the DJ who was a friend of a friend and was spinning some mad Latin beats. I think it was Samba inspired and I really liked it.   The lounge area is inviting and makes great for intimate or group parties. The furniture is vintage-velvety and the placement of overhead paper/glass chandeliers is quite romantic. I think they really excel at lighting which I think sets the mood for the perfect hookah lounge experience.   I'll be back.

I've been eating my way through the lunch menu since their opening this summer (2011) and I have to say this is some pretty good Thai. The lunch hours are very bustling so I learned quickly to call in my take-out order in advance to avoid the wait. I've dined in a few times with the service and quality being consistently good regardless of how busy they were and that is a very good thing.   They also get good marks from me for subbing items without a fuss. I know to expect the presence of bell pepper in Thai cuisine; however, I just don't like them.  I will eat anything and it's not typical of me to be picky but I just hate bell peppers.  It is the only vegetable I won't eat. So, I asked politely if they wouldn't mind subbing out my bell peppers for extra green beans. My server appeared pleased to do so. I was pleased too.  So on to the food!  Lunch Menu: I love the Wok#10 - Spicy Green Bean add chicken no bell . I learned to ask for my spice level to be spicy-spicy since the just spicy is not spicy enough.  Great dish.   The Wok#5 -Ginger Angel add chicken no bell- sub green bean. Mmmm, I had this dish a few times. Yup, that good.  I was also pleased with the Wok#4-Vegitable Delight add mixed meat requested spicy-spicy.   The Red Curry#15 add chicken sub out bell was good but it could have been just a little more spicy for me. I think I'll request this to be spicy-spicy- spicy next time.  I'll also add that the lunch portions are sizable enough for two meals. Good for my belly and wallet.   I'm excited to try out the dinner menu soon. I've got my eye on the Tiger's Cry and Fish of Three Flavors.

I sampled the Ruby Red Grapefruit which is a featured flavor and I tell my friend Craig that I think it is way too bitter. Then the nice counter gal chimes in with the sweetest tone...Well, grapefruits are bitter, right?  Leave it to me to state the obvious but we both got a chuckle out of it. Meanwhile Craig is wondering what "NSA" stands for which in the context of Fro-Yo, does not mean No-Strings-Attached.  I decide, after sampling all the flavors twice, to go with the creamy island coconut, blueberry and pomegranate sorbets. Cream island coconut is my favorite flavor so far.   The space is small with limited seating but they keep the topping counter and pumps super tidy.

Timo's Monday night special was a hit and I'm now almost positive I have found the perfect dinning companion. David and I are eating our way through the best of Phoenix and I'm secretly creating my own list along the way.   We decided on Monday night to take advantage of the flatbread and wine special. I had no Idea we would practically close out the place, two flatbreads, two bottles of wine and 6 tapas later. Wow, what a meal. David selected the wine, he's great at that and I selected the flatbreads and we both had dibs on a few tapas.  The lamb chops, tamarind drumettes, smoked salmon, warm figs & prosciutto and a salad. I specially liked the lamb chops and warm figs, David went crazy for the salad.   We were both drunk ; )

The toasty perfection of the tortilla is what sets Luncha Libre's 'dillas apart from the rest. I had the Carne Asada 'dilla and the tort was a little charred, a little sweet and was imparted with all the flavors from the grill.   I would buy a side order of grill toasted tortilla chips if it was an option. I also had the orange blossom tea and was given a large mason jar to keep and return for refills and a buck off my future visits. Now how good is that?!  Mondays: Lunch at Luhr's (Alley) - Downtown Phoenix

My buddy Craig and I were in the mood for something hearty and saucy so we decided to give The Strand a try and boy were we happy we did. We had the Bucatini Polpetti and a Caesar salad. Although the portion sizes are enough to share, it didn't even cross our minds until after we had stuffed our faces. We had no problem devouring every last bite on our own. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was amazing; robust, spicy, and plentiful. The meatballs were great, too. The salad was definitely enough for two and we will split that in the future.  The interior design and layout of the dinning area is very different, cool unlike any other place which is refreshing. The ordering process is very similar to Pei Wei but it works and was super easy. The owner was kind enough to stop by our "pod" and check in on us and was thrilled to share his design and dinning concept. He excitingly shared the story behind the commissioned panoramic photograph that takes up the majority of the north wall.  The lighting fixtures are also very cool, somewhat jellyfish like.   We are looking forward to our next dinning adventure. The online menu has been printed, reviewed and circulated.

I spent the entire weekend calling and visiting a few local nurseries for a specific flowering vine that I'll be planting along my east facing wall. After a few stops and calls with no luck I considered purchasing the vine online but when I found out the supplier was in Cincinnati, OH and the shipping was the same amount as the vine I was like Yeah, right, NO! Feeling defeated and bummed and almost out of options I gave Summerwinds a call and luck be on my side, THEY HAD THE VINE! I was soo excited I rushed over and although they did not have the specific variety on hand with their most recent shipment, I purchased the one they had and will be returning in a week to see what else comes in. The customer service is great and the guys were very helpful and even convinced me to become a member. They even offer Saturday classes which I do plan on attending. My next project is it plant a hedge of jumping cholla along my side wall to keep lookie loos and jumpers from getting all up in my business. Summerwinds will be my go to.

I wore my pj bottoms and got 50% off my piled high order. I took my selections home to enjoy and to share with my dogs. They loved the pistachio and cake batter but one of them is fro-yo intolerant and doggie diarrhea is never a pleasant experience.

Great fast food concept that is referred to as the "subway" for sushi as it relates to the ordering and assembly process. The process is easy and just like Subway you can design your own meal or select from one of the standard items on the menu. The quality of the product is quite good - the tuna looked exceptionally fresh during my visit so that's what I had. Outside of their menu items, you can design your own roll by selecting your preferred wrap, rice, three veggies, one protein and any sauce/topping you want (some toppings cost extra). The staff was very friendly and even shared some upcoming possible changes that may be happening - Deep fried tempura rolls. Yum! They also offer beer, sake, and Mochi Ice Cream.   The best part is they are open till 10pm, Mon-Sat. This is awesome!

My weekly coffee spending has gone from $22  to $3 thanks to the 50 cent 12ounce house deal. The 16oz will cost you $1.90 and every so often I'll go with two 12 oz cups for a buck; more product- better deal. Now that's fantastic.  The staff is very friendly and I think they are on to my little scheme. I hope they don't cut me off.

Mary is my go to on the regular for all things hemming, adjusting and repair. Her shop is nothing fancy and some might be intimidated by the location but I'm not whatsoever.  She gets the job done spot on everytime and at a great price. 10 bucks for hemming is a bargain and on my most recent vist, she was able to complete the task in 20 minutes. She's the best.  I also like that her shop smells like a jar of Arnold's pickles. I love pickles!!!

Twirl is adult whimsical and lacks the tweenie-cutsie atmosphere found with its competitors. I really like the laid back vibe and although the product quality is quite similar (in all honesty) to others, I find hanging here more enjoyable. The price point is 40 cents per ounce but who's really counting and If I end up with a $8 cup of for-yo then that's my own fault.   My combo is the caramel, cheesecake-add graham cracker crumbs, a smidge of chocolate sauce and a gummy worm for good measure. Eat the worm first.   I dig the place and you should too.

I met some friends here this past weekend for the Brazilian Carnaval event and it was a good-good time. The place is huge, the drinks are super cheap and there are spots to hang out like a VIP without having to be a VIP.  I've never been to a dance club where there were more people on the dance floor than anywhere else in the club. I was blown away by the moves some of the dancers were throwing down; it was murder!  It would have sent Disco Dottie into cardiac arrest without having to snort a single line.

I'm so thrilled to have The Skinny Italian move into the neighborhood and every visit has been great. I occasionally work as an art instructor at Me The Artist up the block and having this addition to the City North family has been fantastic. I love the décor (I want that tin ceiling), the space and the lunch options are awesome.   I die for the Arugula salad and the Panini special is a great deal.  The pasta portion is enough to share with a friend. I want a punch card!

I was shocked to find out that I was smack dab in the middle of a tournament and never noticed.  This event was much to do about everything except golf.  The crowds, the fashion, the debauchery, VIP tents, punch card drink tickets, drunk chicks, MILFs, frat boys, and DILFs galore. It was mayhem and I loved every hot messy second of it.  It was also a great time to catch up and spend quality time with some of my favorite people.  We caught up on old times and made plans for our future. So much has happened in the last year or so....One of us became a mom, one of us is in a fabulous LTR with a really cool guy and one of us is basking in the upside of being perfectly single and absolutely happy.    There were so many moments of wonderful that happened throughout the day but nothing compares to that split second one of your friends commits the one forbidden faux paz just as a tee off was about to happen which resulted in a crowd of head spins and scathing glares. OH NO SHE DIDN'T!!!! It was priceless!  This day could not have been any better.

I'll start off by saying I absolutely hate burpees. I know one of these days I'm going to face plant hard and bust my teeth out. I just know it.  That aside, this was a hell of a work out and it really felt like I was training for that one big fight. I was geared up, wrapped fists, sweat soaked, metal music pumped and feeling a tad bit like Rocky Balboa in one of those dramatic training montages.   We were a group of five and our trainer was not only funny but really engaging.  We did a variety of warm up and floor exercises and then took to the bags hard. My shoulders were on fire and my arms felt  ton heavy.  Each of us had a quick one on one with the trainer and my set was left jab, left jab, right jab, right jab, left hook, right hook. I was out of breath but I knew he could see my tiger eyes so he keep pushing me on. We ended our boxing session with cool down then stepped inside the ring for a feelzy, had our picture taken by the owner, unwrapped our fists then called it a session.  I'm itching for another go at the bag. I'll be back.  Note: This is a true to form boxing gym, hard and gritty so to speak....Don't expect fancy.

Exceptional is a descriptor that is truly warranted and results that are definitely delivered.    I was forced to find a new doctor because of an insurance change and The Oculist met my search needs based on that change, distance from my house, Saturday hours, high Yelp ratings and I was thrilled to find it to be independent (gotta love that!)   First to mention is how super clean and modern the space is and they really get it, less is more.... much much more! It's unlike any other eye glass center I've trusted my vision and vision-ware to. I received a warm and welcoming reception from Brian who was very personable and attentive. We even struck up small talk as I was filling out my initial paper work. We talked about many things from neighborhoods, to food, to bikes. I loved hearing that they also live in the neighborhood and stay committed to the five mile bubble as I do.  Dr Marquez was  just as sweet and a true professional. I felt immediately comfortable with her and could tell she really loves what she does, impressed by her expertise and attention to detail. Honestly, the best eye exam I've ever had...quite the eye opener beyond the obvious.  Both Dr. Marquez and Brian worked as a team to help me decide on the perfect frame. They have various price points which I can see being attractive to someone one on a tight budget and the lower price point designs are comparable to the high price point options. You mean I can pay almost close to nothing  and I don't have to look like Ronnie Milsap or feel positively goofy like Jan Brady?......SWEET!  I was having such a tough time deciding which frames to go with when I decided just to go with the top two I liked the most. One set will be my business look and the other will be my sporty trying to look smart look.   I'll be back in a couple weeks for a contact exam and fitting.   Yay for us!

I have an on, off and on again relationship with at home juicing and I really should decide if I'm in it or if it will be something I will always half love. It's quite a chore and an investment of time and more of a clean up than it's worth and I figure I'll probably never do it again once the Juicer I have finally burns out.  So I start thinking, it cost roughly 10 bucks for all my ingredients and about 45 min of my time to produce a glass of my favorite juice blend. Tropical Smoothie has the same exact drink for $4 in and out in a jiffy. NO clean up!!!! The juicer may find its way off my kitchen counter and into my go-to Goodwill box very soon. Plus Tropical Smoothie's version of my Spinach, Kale, Pineapple, Mango and Peach drink taste much much better than mine.

I love pancakes but really hate trying to make them at home.  With Joe's just a short bike ride up the road from me I'm probably going to forgo ever attempting on my own again. The pancakes are so good and even better as part of the #2 menu item.  Two pancakes, bacon, sausage and eggs prepped your way. It's a big tasty meal!   My friend ordered the biscuits and gravy and said he really liked them.  I think I've just discovered I really do not like country gravy. On the other hand, I really like turkey gravy on anything.

The best donation drop off location I've ever been to. I pull up to the double sliding doors, open my trunk, a courteous receiver comes to my car, unloads my unwanteds and gives me my tax receipt.  It is that easy!  Furthermore, I cannot believe I'm still purging and donating crapola almost four years after my big break-up. Will my closets and nooks and crannies ever stop regurgitating clutter I never knew I had and most certainly have no need for!! This Shiz is 'nanas!  P.S I refuse to shop at this Goodwill because I'm just the type of psycho that donates bins of junk only to repurchase said junk during a future wild hair goodwill-hunting shopping spree. There has got to be a pill for this.

The freshest most delicious sushi in my downtown bubble. Great for lunch and even better for dinner and the times I've been in it was super bustling. It's probably the hottest spot on the block.  The albacore tuna sashimi melted on my tongue and the tuna titaki  was probable the sexiest thing I've had in my mouth in quite some time.  One thing's for sure and that is a great meal, great quality, happy staff, uber friendly owner and an empty pile of plates.  My faves: Stuffed Jalapenos, Oh My God Roll, Sex and the City Roll, H3 Roll and of course the tuna titaki.   Oh and FYI, the Chef's Choice sampler is just that... Chef's Choice... Leave it to me to try and change things up.

I no longer stress or lose sleep over how I'm going to make my early morning flights.  The Uber app is simple, driver confirmation and arrival are always spot on and I've always lucked out with getting super happy drivers. Im not much of a morning person and although pin drop silence is my usual preference before day break....I really look forward to the chipper chatter professionalism of my UB-ers. I dont mind the standard series of questions I get that pass the time and make a 25 min ride seem like 10. It's an enjoyable no hassle no delay get me there as fast as you can kind of thing. Like!

Not only did Santos Lucha give me a fantastic idea for my costume this past Halloween they also serve up some really good tacos. I was very indecisive about my meat selections so they welcomed me to a full sampling. They line em up from mild to hot to hotter then hottest. I liked them all but I decided on the vinegar chicken, pastor and conchinita.  They really pack the tacos full of meat and give you a variety of toppings. I was full half way through my last taco. I'll be back for more.
