I have about 30 different choices when it comes to the cheap-drink+bar food combo in my hood. I also have about 300 lunch choices. What keeps me coming back to the 'Dillo is the perfect blend of:  - Delicious food (drink or no drink) - Reasonable drink prices - Servers who go out of their way to learn about their customers   Yes, 2PM on a Monday can be depressing. But isn't that true everywhere?  Eat the Philly Cheesesteak. Just eat it. It will be the best decision you made all week. Totally worth the extra gym time.

Let's just start by saying that I rarely eat at chain restaurants. So the fact that I ended up at Capital Grille for Valentine's day is actually a little embarrassing. But the combination of a $100 gift card that was about to expire, a fond memory of steak tar tar and homemade potato chips at their bar, and a failure to make any other sort of reservation landed us there at about 8pm on Sunday night. I really wasn't feeling like anything fancy, so we decided to sit at the bar, nosh, and watch the Olympics.  First, cocktails. Mine: an expertly made Manhattan that was approximately the size of my head (hurray for oversized martini glasses!) My husbands: Hendricks, rocks, cucumber. Our bartender offered to go get cucumber slices from the kitchen as it was a garnish they typically had at the bar. Score 1 for Kevin the bartender.   Next, food order. This had the potential to be the low point of the evening when they informed me they no longer had the steak tar tar on the menu. Or the ketlle chips. I now wanted to cry. We settled for a caprese salad, beef carpaccio, and the lobster crab cakes. Salad came out promptly, was very tasty and nice presentation. And then...nothing. The other apps lagged for like 15 minutes and the bartender was visibly irritated at the kitchen and wait staff. Luckily I had a full drink in front of me and it was the skating pairs short program on TV so I really wasn't complaining. When the food did show up it was actually worth the wait. Nothing I would have changed about it at all.  For the dessert portion of the evening we decided to try a Colheita port, which the bartender described as a single vintage tawny port. My husband loves tawny port and they had one that was fairly reasonable but still in the Colheita category. Rounded it out with the flourless chocolate espresso cake. Sadly, we were informed they no longer carried our port selection. And then, not so sadly, they poured us a much more expensive version for the price of the other one! Oh, and the dessert itself - freaking amazing. Best chocolate torte I've had in a while.   The actual shocker of the evening was that they took the appetizers off the bill without us saying anything about it. This really wasn't necessary but I think it shows that this place really does have class and that they wanted us to know that wasn't up to their standard of service. Well played.  Oh, and, right before we left the bartender leaned over and said "Come back on a day when it isn't a holiday and we'll get the kitchen to make you some steak tar tar.  They do it for me all the time." Bless you, sweet bartender man. And thank you for a lovely Valentine's day.

This is my favorite lunch spot in Ahwatukee. The gyro meat is always fresh, the tzaziki is tasty, pitas are toasted. Basically a perfect gyro sandwich. And even the "single gyro" is huge. I'm not sure how people order double and triple orders. My friends also like the chicken artichoke pita, though I'm not a huge fan of chicken gyro meat in general. The service is always really friendly and the food is very reasonable priced. My only complaint would be about the decor - faded posters showing gyros and hot dogs really don't do it for my appetite. Luckily the food is so good I can ignore the visuals.

Some days you just want food that is bad for you in the best way. My typical Cracker Barrel order:  - 2 eggs, scrambled - Biscuits (with butter) - Hashbrown Casserole (mmmmm cheesy potatoes) - Cinnamon Apples  For whatever reason this combination doesn't exist on their menu, so I usually end up ordering the Hasbrowns, Apples and Biscuits with a side of two scrambled eggs. But whatever. The point is that all of those things together are amazing. They make you feel like you're 6 years old and out to breakfast with Grandma. Plus, the crazy kitschy store sells John Deere baseball caps. How can you not love that? Add the fact that it's cheap as hell...plus the peg game on the tables...and it basically makes up for the fact that the servers appear to be hired from the local halfway house.   So yeah. When your arteries are feeling particularly too clear and you need some warm, salty, buttery goodness....head to Cracker Barrel.

I called Floral 2000/Floral Couture in a panic at 2pm and asked if they could have 2 $50 bouquets delivered to the Convention Center by 4pm. Without hesitation the woman on the other end of the line said "No problem," asked a few questions to make sure she understood what I wanted, and by 330pm I had flowers. Turned out they were the most dependable, professional vendor that we had at the whole event and I couldn't have been happier. If I ever need to plan a larger event in Vegas again I will definitely turn to them for the floral package.

The number of 5 star reviews this place has just baffles me. I have tried... really really tried....to love Chelsea's. The location makes it a popular spot for work lunches and happy hours so I get dragged in here at least once every couple months. With the exception of maybe the short ribs, I have never had anything but mediocre food and mediocre service. I am starting to think that the people who think this place is 5-star worthy just don't venture outside big restaurant chains that often. Chelsea's must seem like nirvana to someone who is used to Applebees, but there are SO many better places in town!  This last visit finally caused me to put the place on my shun list and prompted this review.  We went during the lunch rush - not their fault - which meant we had to valet ("free"...sure). But the hostess was nowhere to be found when I walked in and they clearly needed more than one person working the front for a little while during the big rush (hello? manager?) She eventually took my name but did not write down the number in my party. My friend got there and walked in to inquire as to the wait time. No big deal, 10 more minutes. Twenty minutes later, as we were melting away waiting on the patio, she went back inside to inquire again. The hostess was surprised to see her. She had forgotten we were out there. She sat us at one of the 7 tables that had come available while we waited.  Then the servers couldn't figure out whose table it was, so two people came to take our drink order. Again, not deadly, but still annoying after the hostess experience. Once they figured it out the service smoothly enough. I was a little annoyed that my club soda came in individually priced little bottles. had I remembered that I would have just ordered water. Right around the time our drinks came and the server went to take our order I realized how loud the place was. She was literally shouting so that we could hear her describe the specials.  This whole visit could have probably been saved with awesome food. But once again the food was just, meh. I ordered the Crispy Chicken Spinach Salad. The chicken was flabby and greasy, but not crispy. Most of the fried part actually fell off in peels of fat when they sliced the chicken. I tried to save a couple pieces, but the coating was so tough that I ended up just stripping off what hadn't fallen off on its own. The rest of the salad was pretty good, maybe a little overdressed.  My friend ordered the Howie Burger which she pronounced "Good, but you can't screw up a burger." I beg to differ, considering the Vig manages to do it every time, but she seemed happy enough to eat the whole thing so that's something. The fries were seasoned with what tasted like the seasoning on BBQ chips and were a little tough. I don't like sweet seasonings on fries and this spice blend tasted like it had quite a bit of sugar in it. Maybe that's a personal preference, I thought it was weird.  Previous recent failures included: Fish tacos - good fish but way too much of the melon salad on top and soggy tortillas Brussel sprout salad - again, could have been great, but overdressed and soggy and skimpy on the other ingredients Green Chile Burger - ordered medium...came out dry, heavy, and grey  Monica is still one of the loveliest bartenders in town, so I may get suckered into happy hour once in a while, but will stick to drinks for the remainder of the visits to this place.

My husband and I went here with another couple on Valentine's day (non-traditional I know, but a ton of fun none-the-less). Things that I really liked included my mojito(s), my shrimp and lobster enchilada (the dinner special for the evening), the rice, our waiter, the music, the lounge. Things that I was just sort of "eh" about included the chips and salsa, the bathrooms, the corn mush, the dessert. To be more specific, the enchilada in particular was amazing - shrimp and roasted corn inside, bits of lobster in a spicy cream sauce on the outside. The dessert consisted of three particularly horrid "iced butter cakes" that tasted sort of like Little Debbies that had sat out overnight. But since I was so stuffed full of yummy food and floating away on a sea of expertly mixed mojitos...I am going to just remove one star and call it good.   I want to go back here on a more casual night and grab some "small plates" in the lounge. This could become part of our regular rotation.

First off - we were looking for somewhere to eat in the west valley and Kabuki Sushi popped up on the GPS as being nearby. Thinking it was the same Kabuki that is at Tempe Marketplace and Westgate I was excited. Um. Yeah. Definitely not the same place. I'll start with the good:  - Service was very attentive and friendly (actually, the service sort of saved this from being a 1-star experience) - Huge selection of specialty rolls - Kid-friendly (the sushi chefs even entertained my daughter)  Now, the bad.  - The place smelled like fish. Not a good sign. - 99% of the rolls were made with "crabmeat". Even the Philly roll, which is very very odd.  - The food was very expensive for the quality. Two rolls made with mostly crabmeat and some nigiri, plus a couple 4.50 beers, quickly became a 70 dollar "quick bite." - The menu has pictures. Not very appetizing pictures.  I probably should have known better than to eat sushi anywhere in the avenues. And I'm still kind of baffled by how there can be two completely different restaurants in the same city with the same name? Either way, I will actively seek another alternative next time I'm in that area.

I can't believe I haven't yelped about the place yet. Several months (maybe over a year?) ago my husband read a newspaper article about the Clover coffee maker and the one place in town that had managed to procure one. I was skeptical (as is my nature). It can't be that much better right? You're just saying it's amazing because you want to talk about the new hot coffee shop you discovered, right? Well, maybe. But I love this place. And I don't think it has a whole lot to do with the Clover. They roast their own beans and they roast them way differently than that other ginormous coffee chain - all a light or medium roast. Never bitter, never oily, never yucky. The coffee they make there is, obviously, the best. But I send my husband in every week now to buy a pound of beans so that I can approximate the same coffee at home. Add an edgy (though sometimes intimidating) seating area, great local art (which we bought off the wall), and smiley service...I'm sold. Can't wait to try out the downtown location.

Went here with a group of friends and followed the "everyone order 2 things" recommendation of our friendly, helpful waiter. Everything was tasty, with a couple standout items. Bacon wrapped lychee - amazing. Spicy shrimp special thing - also incredibly. There was really only a couple things that were just OK (I've never been a huge fan of spring rolls in the first place). The pace was perfect and the staff was attentive. All in all, a great experience for a group.

The original Postino has only gotten better since they separated from LGO, and this new one is the best yet (I'm biased...it's closer to my house and I don't have to valet or fight with the LGO bunnies over parking). I love the indoor/outdoor bar and the feel of the inside. I love the food. The menu looks like it has been updated/revamped a little since the split and everything I ordered was cooked and seasoned perfectly. They have this breakfast dish that is a piece of grilled french bread with an egg and grilled asparagus and a little tomato salad...to die for. I love the cheap wine during the day (even on weekends!). The sparkling Sauvignon Blanc is worth a stretch outside your comfort zone. In general I just really like this place. In fact, I like it enough to forgive the sometimes spotty service...which is the only thing keeping me from a 5 star review.

I can tell this place is going to be a new addiction. I liked the uptown store so much that I went to the Arcadia store right afterward to check out what they had. In both locations I had professional and very helpful service. And the merchandise was phenomenal. Ann Taylor. Banana Republic. Express. BCBG. Michael Kors. Max Studio. Elie Tahari. Michael Stars. Seven for all Mankind. BeBe. And that was all in the first 15 minutes! And 99% of it was under $20! Today, $60 got me a pair of Express pants, two designer blazers, a Max Studio blouse an adorable wide leather belt. Best. Shopping. Day. Ever.  Also, the consignment process was super-easy. When I saw how awesome their inventory was I grabbed the two pairs of pants out of my car that were on their way to the tailor to be taken in. Why settle for slightly ill-fitting pants when I can consign them and get new ones??? Now I just need to stop myself from calling compulsively to see if I have store credit yet....

First off, you have to know what you're getting. So the five star rating here is not a "oh my god this is great gourmet french food" five star rating. It's a "that was damn good pizza served to me by super friendly individuals at an incredibly low price" five stars. We actually consumed our damn good pizza on premises at one of the three little tables they have. The boys working were very sweet to me and my family and went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. There was Mad Max playing on the TV, which occupied my husband and daughter for a while. And for a cheap family meal out I'd pick this place over Sauce any time. No booze, but the place next store sells package 6 packs. The only mildly uncomfortable thing about the experience was the strong wind from the AC over the table. When one of our guests mentioned it, one of the kids working got up on a stool and fashioned a little gizmo out of a pizza box that directed the air away from her. Now that's service.

I have been a customer of this place for 17 years and have never had anything but wonderful experiences. I remember them being patient and professional when I got my nose pierced at the age of 18 and they are just as friendly and wonderful now that I'm a boring professional 35 year old mom. Marilyn is probably the only person I will trust to pierce my daughter's ears once she's old enough. Knowledgeable front desk staff as well. Great all around.

ALL OF THE STARS. I will go back and review this place again in a couple weeks once the whole place gets in rhythm. But for now let's just say these guys had their sh*t together on an opening night that taxed everyone at DeSoto Central Market.  Fried cauliflower was amazing. Whatever they did to the celery was voodoo style stuff. I ate the bowl as a meal and couldn't have been happier. Now must systematically try everything else.  So happy! Thanks guys!

Will update this after they've been open longer but since I've now been here twice in a week...let's just talk happy hour.  First experience they were slammed on a Saturday evening and we told them we were just there for cocktails. Was expecting a little attitude given how busy they were, but got none of that. Hostess was very accommodating. They seated us at the kitchen rail and we had great service, along with great cocktails. Big fan of the Joe's Stiffy. Just saying. Was fun to watch the guys cook and the service seemed really well oiled, especially considering they're still really new and they had zero room to move around.   Second experience was a much more chill Monday happy hour. Sat at the bar. Again, very chill. And wine on tap! Back to the Future on TV! Old school jams on the radio! I could move in here. Bartender checked back enough to be attentive but not so much as to be creepy. A+. Seemed like a lot of people working the floor for such a small place but I bet they are still figuring out what they really need and everyone looked busy so more power to them.   Suggestions for improvement all have to do with the buildout. The big skylight makes it bake in the middle of the building and the AC over the bar cranks the whole time to make up for it. Spacing on the seating could be easily remedied if only it weren't for the big concrete curb in the center under the booths. These are all things that can be fixed with some additional investment, or just left alone and it will be what it will be. Other than those little thing the place feels cozy and funky and fun. They did a good job here and they seem invested in running a high quality operation. Hurray!
