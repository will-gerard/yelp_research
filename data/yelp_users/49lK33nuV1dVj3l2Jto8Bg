love love love it! What a quaint little piece of heaven. Located south phoenix...I wasn't sure what this place would look like as we kept driving south but as we walked onto the property it felt as if you were no longer in the big overcrowded city. We went to the morning glory cafe for breakfast. The food was wonderful and the presentation was great! I highly recommend it. It would make a wonderful place for a baby or wedding shower!!

The best place for music in arizona! They have been around for years and I was super happy when they came to central phoenix. They are knowledgeable and friendly.

I went into Bravi for the first time this evening...I live in central phoenix so & I don't get over to the west side very often. This evening I met my sister for dinner on her side of town. Now she had been before and told me it was yummy..it was INDEED yummy. I got the Baked Ziti and ordered my daughter the kids mac n cheese. The items are baked when you order them so even though it appears to be fast foodish in the set up of the restaurant don't be fooled. Our food came out and it was delish...good size portions. pasta was perfect with tasty sauce. My sister got the Gorgonzola pear salad and after having a bite I wished I would have ordered that for lunch tomorrow!! Chill relaxed environment with a bar in the back and tv's which were tuned into the baseball game....Huge bonus they offer Mr Pibb!! The staff was attentive and very curious.  I ordered my husband a turkey sandwich to go and Iam happy to report it was thumbs up for him as well!! will make sure to get to the west side again in the near future.

flo's has gone through a transformation. IN the past few years they have moved and expanded. They are always clean and well organized. Their used items are perfectly priced they have new merch too which is priced accordingly. It is an upscale thrift..I love it!

not too impressed...the lighting in the store was blinding..the music was obnoxious and the staff was into their own deal...the prices were good..I have to say that. However it was dirty (i mean dust on the shoes) and very unorganized..try another place

the worst experience I have ever had a medical facility. We came here for my adult son's Eczema. He was having a severe flare up and I suspected that it was infected. Since we couldn't get into his Derm or Primary Care Dr we went to the ER. My son's father was there to check him in. I was on my way there from work. I arrived about 45min after he was checked in. The rooms are ridiculously small and uncomfortably outdated. I can overlook that. What I can't overlook is the bedside manner of the staff. The nurse's eyes practically rolled out of their sockets when I started asking questions. I wanted to know what the doctor thought of his skin. Was it infected? Maybe staph?  Does he need a blood test? After giving me a hard eye roll she mumbled that she was going to get the Dr ( I think that is what she said) and be right back. The Dr was horrid. She was condescending and totally unprofessional. She shot down every request I made and talked to me as if I was stupid for even thinking that he needed a blood test. "his vital signs are better than anyone else on this floor" & " staph is on everyone's skin" in her best condescending tone. We left with feeling no compassion from anyone in that hospital except maybe the coordinator that had no problem taking my $150 co/pay. The charlatan  sent us with a few scrips. Upon researching the scrips i realized she prescribed something for his skin that was completely wrong and nothing close to what was going on. A few days later we got into Phoenix Skin Derm and the dr there told us that yes in fact his skin was infected and they prescribed the correct antibiotics.  If you have no experience with an area of health then ask for a second opinion by another doctor or at least show some compassion. WOULD NEVER GO BACK! I would drive 20 minutes in any direction to go to any other hospital

Being a bakers daughter....I know cupcakes! I LOVE LOVE them but Iam a harsh critic...the store itself is cute and the girls who own it are sweet and LOCAL...huge plus in their favor. The cupcakes are pretty but pretty doesnt make my tummy happy. The cake is dry and tasteless...like said before there is a ton of frosting (which I love ) but even that is just eh...I want a great cupcake place...someone someone help a sister out

i was SOOOO excited to see this little shop by the owner of Frances Vintage. I love love love the decor...the outside, the inside, the counter, the bags, the awnings....I was really hoping for C A N D Y and lots of it...I didnt get that..mostly expensive novelty items  that I was not in the market for..the candy I did see was mostly the kind I could pick up anywhere. They had some original birthday party favors like vintage pin the tail on the donkey game and custom made birthday hats. I really like the shop I could spend hours LOOKING around but Iam hoping for more candy please.....

We love the food at pita jungle. We have been going for years. Most recently the past 8 months or so to the downtown area. The service has become so terrible I have vowed to never go to this location again.  1. Called in a to go order to pick up on the way home from work. I arrive and was told it was not ready, in fact it wasn't even put in yet (15 min from work to pita) she apologized and offered me a soda. Cool I'll take it. Mistakes happen. 20 min layer my order was done but they forgot one of the meals. They hadn't even made it. I cut my losses paid and left. I shared the one meal with my husband. Lame  2. Seated outside, waitress was so uninterested in our table I felt like she was 1. About to go home or 2. About to quit  Took our order in a timely manner but was never seen again. No drink refills and never checked in on us   3. Was seated inside but waited about 15 min to only finally being approached after flagging someone down. There was a game letting out downtown so it was busy. They were obviously understaffed. The waiter was apologetic but still was having a hard time keeping up with the customers. Food was good as usual but the staff was more concerned with the large groups than my husband and I  4. Tonight.....we sat outside and waited..... Was approached by a friendly waitress who took our order. The food was brought out by someone else.  We had no silverware and had to ask ....and never saw another employee again. Frustrated my husband went inside to pay our waitress (also the bartender) who we saw through the outdoor window talking to customers/employees and texting. No drink refills or check ins.  Our bill was $66 that is too much to pay for a terrible experience. Sorry pita, you taste yummy but your service has been consistently terrible. I will drive to another location that is out of my way before going back to this location.

Delicious ice cream with unique flavors. The staff however is too cool to smile or engage in basic customer service. Sad but not too sad that I won't return I'll just remember to not expect too much from the dudes behind the counter
