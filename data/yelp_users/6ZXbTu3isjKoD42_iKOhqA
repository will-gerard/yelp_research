This place is overwhelmed with scorpions.  Whatever you do, don't rent from these people.

Really fast service, those nasty little tacos came with lots of shredded lettuce, which I requested, and it's close to my house.  Thanks, Jack in the Box.

Food and service were great.  Lots of extras requested and got every single one.   My daughter, (who has Down Syndrome)  loves this place and so do I.   Maybe it's because of who she is, or maybe it's because the service there is top notch, but the staff there almost always treat Megan extra special.  Whatever she wants, all the way down to how many meatballs she wants and extra stuff on her salad.  Thanks Olive Garden, we will see you again soon.

I don't come to AMC very often, even though it is the closest to my house, has great parking, good movies.  And there is only one reason....THE HARKINS $1 SODA CUP!  Listen, AMC, get something similar and you will have my business every time.  I can't justify going into a movie theatre and paying $4 or $5 for a soda.  So you know what I did?  I snuck it in in my purse.  Paid at the kiosk so never really had to talk to a person.  I'm going to do this from now on if I go there.  I have a new purse, soda cup fits great without spilling.  GET A SODA CUP AMC!

We went there on a Saturday night, and it was swamped.  We waited a little while, but did get seated in a reasonable amount of time.    Talk about overpriced and not very good.  We both got the spaghetti and there was hardly any sauce on it, so we asked for a side dish, and the size of the side dish of sauce (for both of us) was laughable.  It had a decent taste, that's why there's two stars instead of one.  I had to ask again for more sauce, and they brought us another little tiny dish of sauce.   And we also sat there for a good long time with empty soda glasses.  I would never go back to this place.

Went there for an early dinner today.  I had a baja steak burrito and my daughter had steak nachos, along with two diet cokes.  My burrito was ok.  Megan's nachos were ok.  Neither one was anything special.   The salsa bar was a mess.  They say there are no tomatoes, so all the salsa they had was the green stuff and something else that was black and didn't taste very good.  There were no limes in the salsa bar, and I love limes, so told them.  I was almost done with my meal by the time they finally got them out.  Garbage was completely full, almost spilled stuff on the ground when I was trying to put my stuff away.  Tables were a mess.  But the employees had time to play grabass in the back.  I had a groupon, so got a good deal.  I won't be going back.  I like Fili Bs much better.

This place is always good.  Food is consistent, place is spotless and the  wait staff are nice beyond measure.  We got chips and salsa to start, and they refilled our chips for free.  We both got the chicken club salad, but instead of fried chicken we got grilled.  The chicken was pretty overdone, but not so much so that I felt the need to send it back.  I don't know how they do it, but this place always makes you feel welcome, and I have never had bad service here.  Prices are a little expensive for my blood, but if Megan and I feel the need to treat ourselves, we will go back.  The rolls are AMAZING!

I got there at 8am, they had me in the back by 810am, and by 830 am I was done.  Had a diabetes exam so they had to dialate my eyes, which makes them very sensitive to light.  They gave me some dark lenses to put behind my glasses also.  The lady that dialated me was great too.  Friendly,  nice, and I would go back in a heartbeat.....thanks Southwestern Eye Center.

If I could give this store negative stars, I would.  I went in there on Sunday to shop for some pants for my daughter.  She is short and wide (she has down syndrome) and there are some pull on pants with pockets that she loves there, deep pockets for her cell phone.  We find 4 pair of pants in her size (amazing in itself), I got an article of clothing , and I got a printer cable.  As usual, there were only 3 cash registers open (on a sunday at noon)  so we go through the help yourself aisle.  Line moves fast and I notice that that there is a person standing right in the middle of the do it yourself lines ringing people up also, so as it's my turn, I can either pick a do it yourself or go to her, so I go to her (don't like the do it yourself).  I have 6 items, 4 exactly the same.  She tell me "you have too many items, I can't help  you."  Really, 6 items is too many for you?  So as usual, poor customer service in this store.  So I turn around, and of course every one of the do it yourself registers are now full.  So not only can she not help me, because I have 6 items (too many for her little Walmart brain to handle) but I now get to stand in line again.  I walked.  I have had very poor customer service in this store again and again, and I keep coming back.  This was the last straw.  I  have also written Walmart, and I bet you money that I will never hear from them.  It's all about volume for this company, they could really give a shit about customer service.  As long as all the people come to their stores and spend money, that's all this corporation cares about.  Do yourself a favor and stay away from Walmart.  I know they are less expensive that Safeway, but not at the expense of your sanity, and if you expect anything resembling customer service, you won't get it here.  STAY AWAY!

Have never heard a word from corporate, even an apology email would have been nice.  I'd be willing to bet they get SO MANY complaint letters they just can't keep up.  Or they just don't give a shit.  My money is on the second.

I took my car into this shop for a brake job.  And the guy who ran it told me that I needed rotors and pads all the way around.  Now remember, this is a "discount auto repair".  He informs me that this is going to cost me $599, which includes an oil change.  Wow, I can get the parts for less than $100 at penny pincher auto.    So I told him that I couldn't afford $600 for a brake job, and just do the oil change and put it back together.  I go pick up the car, and what do you know, he charges me $75!  That's just for an oil change.  Once again, this is "DISCOUNT AUTO REPAIR".  I have never paid more than $40 for an oil change, never.    So this weekend I had a friend look at my car (he is an ASE certified master mechanic) and what do you know?  All I need are pads on the front of my car.   Basically a $30 part.  And lucky me, I almost get ripped off for $600.    Now I'm sure that I probably would have had new parts all the way around.  Basically a parts change.  For no apparent reason.  He must have thought he saw "stupid female" tattooed on my forehead.  Lucky me,  I am not a stupid female, and when I heard that outrageous price, I was smart enough to have it checked out.  Sure, I had to drive to Tucson for it, but it was certainly worth a $30 tank of gas.  And a $30 part.    Basically, if you go here, notwithstanding all the 5 star reviews, this guy may try to rip you off.  Because, without a doubt, he tried to do that with me.  I'm lucky I just walked away with my $75 oil change.

This place is soooo good.  Nice sour flavors (and others too)  the ice is very very finely shredded, and they really pile on the ice and the flavors.    Customer service is top notch too.  I had a sour cherry with cream in it, and it was absolutely devine.  I would and will go back here in a heartbeat.

My daughter and I just went here for a late lunch before the movies, and got a sausage and artichoke heart pizza and a Caesar salad.  It was out of our way, but we had a Groupon to spend, so the extra drive was okay because of the savings.    OMG it was so good.  Lots of cheese, good quality mozzarella too.  And the sausage was spicy and plentiful.  Artichoke hearts were extra, but well worth it.  Crust was thin and soft, made the pizza somewhat foldable, which I like.  Service was ok, got what we needed when we needed it, like a refill on our Ice T.   We will go back, again and again!

It was very good.  I would have to try it again to see if I would want to up my rating to 5 stars.  It certainly is on par pricewise with most yogurt shops, and does taste better.  You won't go wrong with this place.

I just went in here and got some tacos for lunch.  I love taco tuesday, unfortunately, every time I go to this location, the tacos really really suck.  Hardly any meat, taco shells and meat are way overdone, not much cheese.  And they give you one sauce for 3 tacos.   I was in the neighborhood, and thought I would try it again.  I won't make that mistake again.  The FiliB's on Main and Dobson in Mesa is soooo much better than this place, at least 3 times the meat, tacos shells are crunchy without breaking your front tooth off, and they are much friendlier too.  Don't waste your time at this location, go to the one in Mesa, it will be worth your time!

Went in there to get a couple of Jamba Juices, and I had taken the lid off mine and put it back on, I thought anyway.  And of course When I picked it up to go, I dropped the whole damn thing on the floor, counter, chairs, etc.  It went EVERYWHERE!  I wiped up what I could, and the people who worked there made me another one for free.  They were very tasty, icy and refreshing, and the service is top notch.   Five stars for this Jamba Juice, thank you!

We met some friends there, there were 4 of us all together.  I ordered a Navajo chicken sandwich.  My daughter ordered a bacon cheeseburger, and my friends ordered an Asian chicken salad and a chicken salad sandwich.  20 minutes later, my friends got their food.  And I wait and i wait, and finally 5 minutes later Megan and I got ours.  So we finally begin to eat.  The food was just okay, didn't really taste like much of anything.  Megan said her cheeseburger was ok.  Megan and I also both got a margarita, and for  $8.00 you get about 6 ounces of drink, and that's frozen margaritas, not on the rocks.  Glasses are TINY and the drink was not anywhere near good.   Certainly not worth $8.00.  Restaurant is so noisy you have to  yell across the table to hear anyone, and at night they dim the lights so low you have to really focus on the menu or you can't read it.    All in all a pretty bad experience.   The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is that the cheesecake is pretty good.  $8 for a slice, definitely not worth that, but it tastes good.  I won't be going back and if you don't go either, there's no doubt you have made the right choice.

The food was probably a 3 star, but the service and the price were definitely a one star deal.  I think if the server had deigned to crack a smile (Adam I think) his face would have broke.  And it was so overpriced it wasn't funny.  $9 for a mediocre margarita, are you kidding me?     We ended up spending like $50 for lunch, what a bunch of bs.  Would never go back unless unless someone else was paying.

I'm waiting in the lobby for our pizza as we speak.  Its like a fucking ice berg in here.  In the lobby.  Freezing.   And the front counter people are rude as hell too.     When I got the pizza home, it was ok.  I would never go back here though.  I can't tell you how cold it was in there, literally shaking.  Nice and warm in the back, I'm sure.  Customers come second.

I went there late last night, first because there is 99 cent tacos, and second, because I love late night Mexican food, especially if I partner it with an antacid pill.  Got tacos and rice.  Tacos were wonderful, crispy, and taste awesome.  Rice was very good (5 stars for this)   Now I usually go to the Filis on Dobson and Main, but this was on my way home.  The one on Dobson and Main puts more meat and lettuce in their tacos, so I do prefer that location.  The taste of these though were on par.  Would have given it 5 stars if they would have put more meat and lettuce in it (yes, I know, I am repeating myself).  Can't beat Filibertos, good, inexpensive authentic Mexican food....thank you!

Went there last night and got the Baked Chipotle Fettucini and the Two Tickets to Paradise Shrimp Sandwich.  This is the second time I have been there, and the second time it was just ok.  We went because we had a Groupon.  If you don't know what that is, you should check it out, Groupon.com.  Amazing deals here in Phoenix.    Megan's pasta took a long time, so when we finally got our food, hers was very hot, and mine was barely warm, obviously had been sitting there for a good long while waiting for hers to get done.  I had a green chili mashed potato with my sandwich that was just a few degrees away from cold.  I ate it because I was hungry, but should have sent it back.  Shrimp on the sandwich had a really good flavor, but was also just a few degrees away from being cold. I expected the pasta to be spicy, but that's all it was, spicy.  Didn't really have much extra flavor but spicy.  Diet coke was good.  I have never had the pizza here, I have read that  it's really good.  If someone invites me here, we will get that, otherwise, I won't be back.  Cold food is a turnoff.  Kitchen should have planned better so food would have come out at the same time.

I used to work at this place a long time ago, and went back recently.  The food is as good as ever, the service is fantastic, the prices are reasonable, and the owner is hot.  What more could you want?  I highly recommend the turkey, the prime rib, and the spareribs.  i'm not a rib eater, and the spare ribs are the best I've ever had...you won't be sorry, I promise!

Did you know that on Tuesday you can get tacos for 99 cents?  Well, you can, and the beef tacos are amazing.  When you bite into them, you have grease running down your chin, so keep a napkin handy.   They come with a ton of fresh crispy shredded lettuce, and they don't skimp on the cheese either.  The chicken however, always tastes funny to me.  STAY AWAY FROM THE CHICKEN.......  They do have some outdoor seats, but this place is pretty much a drive through.

I just went here with my daughter.  It got good reviews from everyone, so figured I would give it a try.  I was especially excited when I heard it had a good chili rellano burrito.   So that's what I got, and Megan got a carne asada quesadilla.  First, the help.  I stood there for at least 3 minutes, no one at the counter, and the people in the back just looked at me.  Finally, someone came up to help me.  Towards the end of my order, her personal cell phone rang.  And I kid you not, while she was waiting on a customer, she answered it and began to talk.  I couldn't believe it.  But I figured if the food was good, we would give it a try anyway.  So we went to find a table.  We sat down and I was afraid the wobbly chair under me was going to collapse.  I moved twice before I felt comfortable.  That's a lawsuit waiting to happen.   In the meantime, helped myself to the salsa bar, which isn't bad, give that 3 stars.  The food came out in a timely manner.  My chili rellano burrito had rice in it.  Now, I don't like rice in my burritos, but that's also easy to overlook.  But the rice had PEAS in it.  I kid you not, PEAS, and lots of them.  I hate peas, hate them.  So as I begin to eat, I picked them out, one by one.  The egg coating on the rellano seemed like it was hours old, it was spongy, greasy,  so peeled most of that off too.  And it was very hot, obviously had been heated up in a microwave.    Megan's carne asada quesadilla wasn't too bad, but the meat also seemed like it had been sitting around for quite a while.  All in all, a horrible experience.  There's a Taco Bell right next door.  I would have preferred that, any day of the week.  Needless to say, someone could buy my dinner for me and I wouldn't go back to this nasty ass place.  Rude front counter people, old nasty food, and chairs in the dining room that are ready to collapse.  It was clean...I guess that's something.

I've eaten here a few times (see my tip, burritos were good ) but after seeing the customer service issues on the news you better believe I won't be back.   If you forgot my food I'd  probably call and be mad too.  If that's the way you treat your customers,  I'll pass.   The place is pretty much a s*** hole inside too.

Very good customer service, place was spotlessly clean, wide aisles.  Really nice store.   I have to admit, I was somewhat surprised by this.  I guess I shouldn't be, as I never shop at Bashas.  I will definitely go back to this one.

Very friendly and quick service, and gave me an alternative to fix my window which fell down and wouldn't roll back up.  Something I could afford, even though my window won't roll down anymore.  I'll take it.   Even topped off my brake fluid without asking, as it was low, and didn't charge me for that.  Thanks, Bumper to Bumper, I'll be back, hopefully not anytime soon.

Just took my little Lulu there, she started yelping and was in pain and I couldn't figure out why.  She's a chiweenie, so was worried about her back, as weenie dogs tend to have back problems.  Can't remember which doctor I saw, but he did a very thorough physical exam, turns out she has a pain in her neck, not sure why.  After a toenail clipping and some medications, we are on our way home. Let's hope this makes her better, I love my pets, they are like my kids.

We heard that have great burritos, so we were in the area, so decided to stop.  Customer service was ok, and the burritos were a little below a 3, probably a 2.5  .  I got a green chili burrito and Megan got a carne asada burrito.  Mine was ok, a little bit overfloured.  Too much thickening, not enough meat.  Megan's carne was dry.  Would I ever stop here again, no

I went to TC Eggington's today, and had the Phoenician Chicken Feta Grille, but had it on an onion bun instead of a pita...and OMG is was so good.  The chicken was moist and flavorful, lots of gooey melted cheese, the dipping sauce they gave was to die for.  Nice big piece of watermelon.  They served it with the chef's choice of salad, which was the pasta salad that was drowning in the mayo based dressing.  I didn't eat that.  I would have given it 5 stars if that  pasta salad hadn't been included.  The service was great, ice T glasses kept filled.....you can't miss on this one.  Try it.

I don't give out 5 star reviews very often, but this place deserves one, and then some.  We went early evening this last Sunday.  We walked in, and were immediately greeted and sat.  The place is really cute, very very comfortable chairs, very cosy.  Good for a romantic evening if that's what  you're looking for (I wasn't).   Our waiter was very attentive, but not very personable.  He could smile a bit more, though we never lacked for anything.  Certainly not going to mark off because the waiter never smiled, just an observation.  We ordered chips and salsa (they charge for it) and small salads.  Good on both, not great.    Then Megan and I both got burritos.  Mine was a pork with chile verde sauce on it.  Megan's was a steak with the same sauce.  Here's where it got fantastic.  They were probably the best burritos I have ever had in my life, and I've had A LOT of burritos, being an Arizona native.  The tortillas were huge and very very fresh, the chili verde sauce was also fantastic, so good that I didn't  use any hot sauce, and I ALWAYS use hot sauce.  And the filling, oh, the filling.  A mixture of wonderful tender meat and some kind of corn mixture.  I don't know what it was, but it was fantastic.  Here it is Wednesday, we went there 3 days ago, and I'm still thinking about that meal.  I can't wait to go back and try something else.  Worth every penny and the long drive.

This movie theatre needs a good cleaning.  It's just old enough that your feet are starting to stick to the floor.  But gotta love those $1 drink cups.  We went there because the movie we wanted to see started when we wanted to see it, but wouldn't go back  unless we  had the same issue.  Sticky feet just really don't do it for me.

One of the best Gelato places in the valley that I have tried.   Only one I've been to better is in Tucson, and that place is like being in Italy, this place is a hairs width from that.  Wonderful service, great atmosphere, parking isn't too bad, and prices are reasonable for what you are getting.  We will be back, again and again and again.  They let you taste anything you want before you order too!

My daughter and I went there on Saturday for a late afternoon/early evening dinner.    The place is absolutely adorable, the servers were friendly, accomodating and very helpful.  Man, I thought what a great little place, so glad I bought this groupon!  Wasn't really in the mood for pizza, so I got a calzone with Ham, cheese, onions and tomatoes.  Megan got a meatball sub.  We both got salads that came with bread.  Salads were great, and we were off to a great start.  Then we received our food.    Megan's sub was ok, but my calzone was just flat out nasty.  The crust was about an 1/8 of an inch thick and like overdone pie crust, hard and dark brown.  When I got it, while the waitress was standing there, I actually knocked on it and you could hear the knock and the crust didn't give at all, it was that overdone.  So I think to myself, I can't eat that sh__, I'll just eat the filling.  I don't know what kind of cheese was in there, but it was nasty too, way too many olives and onions and hardly any ham.  I kept trying to dig out something good, but there wasn't much in there.   So we paid, I took it home, ended up throwing it in the dumpster.  So off we went to the grocery store for a major grocery shopping trip.  I was using coupons, as I am attempting to save money like those extreme couponers,  and I'm not very good at it, so we were there for a while.  And what do you know, I start getting upset to my stomach and Megan is actually breaking out into a cold sweat and has to sit down halfway into our shop.     The only reason I am giving this two stars is the service was so good.   Otherwise it would get one.  I would give the food a minus 3 if I could, it was that nasty.   Glad the pizza is good, according to the other reviews, but I won't be back.  Gross.

One word.  GROSS.    I went there last night with my daughter, and we had a Groupon.  It was the day before it expired, and I'm sure they had been inundated with them for the last 3 or 4 days.  So of course when I told her I had a Groupon, the girl at the front counter was nice enough to roll her eyes at me, and of course I told her "I see you roll your eyes at me".  So she told me because they had so many of  these coupons.  Great start.    I got the sliders, a pork, a beef, and a chicken.  My daughter got a bbq beef sandwich.  For our sides we got macaroni and cheese and french fries.  Megan's sandwich was wrapped in foil, and was barely warm, probably because the foil had kept in the the little amount of heat that there was.  My sandwiches were cold, I mean cold to the touch, the meat and the buns, and they were not wrapped in foil.   I took them up to the eye roller and told her to put them in the microwave for a minute, and she did.  French fries were ok, a little salty.   Mac and cheese was very good, at least there was that.  The meat on the sandwiches was dry and tasteless.  I brought a couple of them home and fed them to my dogs and cats.    I had been to this Honey Bears a long time ago, and remember I didn't like it.  Now I remember why, it was frankly, gross.   Even with a coupon, seriously, I would never go back there.  But if you do, say hi to the eye roller for me.

I have never been to Fatburger before and it's right outside the movie theatre I frequent, so we went early to stop for lunch.  Groupons are great!  Now I like hamburgers and fries, but my daughter LOVES them.  And Fatburger didn't disappoint either of us.  The burgers were juicy and cooked just right.  We also ordered bacon on them, and the bacon was cooked nice and crisp with thick slices, none of that see through crap you get at lots of burger joints.  Curly fries were nice and hot and fresh.  And when you have all you can drink diet coke, that's like a big fat cherry on top of a hot fudge sundae!  This place was great, a little expensive for a hamburger place, but really good nonetheless.  We will definitely stop back, especially since we walk right past it at least twice a month when we go to the movies.  Yum.

People here are nice, service is good, you can actually find help if you need it (except for the deli, where the service always sucks, and I mean ALWAYS) , it's always clean,  and it's close to my house.

I drive about 15 miles to get to this place.  I used to work out here and went to this place all the time, and have only had one bad experience, and that was a long time ago.  The prices are a little more than typical, but it's really nice to be able to talk to someone and understand what they say back in a nail salon.  I see some of the same faces I have seen for years too, which is really nice.  The best part is they treat my daughter wonderfully.  She has down syndrome, and sometimes people are not sure how to treat her.  They treat her extra special.  Thanks, Power Nail and Spa.  We'll be back.

I had about 20 minutes yesterday to go in and get the burritos made (we got steak) and get back home.  And it was no problem.  Food was fresh, burrito was very good, they made the burritos exactly how I asked.  The place was sparkling clean.  I got a grapefruit soda, and it was warm and the front counter person was a little snotty, otherwise it would have been 5 stars.  I'll be back!

I needed a new battery for my car and got my last battery at the Auto Zone on 35th Avenue and Glendale, and had some credit from my old battery towards a new battery.   Well, I have moved, and went to this one, the closest to my house.  So glad, as the other Auto Zone had an armed guard at their store.  Scary neighborhood, an armed guard at an Auto Zone?   OMG.  Anyway, I digress.    So I had called earlier in the day, and talked to Jessie.  He told me that when i went in to get my new battery, he would replace my old one with my new one, just ask for him.  So I did.  And he did.  He had to take off a bar that was across the top of my battery as well, wasn't just a pull out the old one and drop in the new one either.  He was very friendly, helpful, even checked the codes on my car for me because my check engine light was on.    It is truly a pleasure to run across service like this.  You don't see it very often anymore, that's for sure.  If I need anything at all for my car, I will certainly go to this Auto Zone.  They have a great employee, and are lucky to have him.  Thanks, Jessie.   They have a customer for life!

I love this place, I mean love it.  I went last Saturday and got the chicken and beef combo with macaroni salad and rice.  The meat is always so tender and juicy, and the taste is WONDERFUL!  And the macaroni salad is nice and creamy.  I always put a lot of the very spicy red sauce they have (though I can't remember the name of it, it's Asian).  I have been coming to this place off and on for several years and have never gotten a bad meal, or bad customer service for that matter.  The only thing I have ever gotten here that I didn't like was the soup.  It had no taste to it at all.  It was the first thing I ever ordered here, almost didn't come back.  So glad I did.    This meal is one of those that you think about for a few days afterwards.  And for two of us, with leftovers, it was $20.  What a deal, what a meal.

Went on Saturday, and man, how things have changed in a few months.  No longer have that wonderful asian sauce in bottles to have as much as you want.  You have to ask for it, and they give you cups with a little tiny bit in it.  Seriously, when you stick your fork in it, it coats just the tips of the fork, that's how little they put in it.  So I had to ask for two.  And it still wasn't enough.  They skimped on the macaroni salad too.  The meat wasn't as juicy either.  I can only imagine that maybe they have changed their management?  We will not ever go back, if we are in the mood for Hawaiian, we will stick with Aloha kitchen.    Ta ta, Ono...

I went in there last night and got a quarter pounder with cheese, fries and a diet coke.  First of all, this place is F___g filthy, I mean the worst I've ever seen at a McDonald's.   I'm not a clean freak by any means, and there's no way I'd let my kid play in that playground.  It looked filthy, can you imagine how much shit there is that you can't see?  And I mean that literally too.  Garbage cans overflowing, drink station with trash all over the place, dirty tables, etc.  And to top it off, I could tell that my sandwich had been sitting around for hours because it was almost like eating sandpaper.  I ended up throwing it away, and throwing food away is not something I do very often, that's for sure.  French fries were good and fresh though, at least there's that.

We got some pork, beef, green corn and a chicken to go.  Definitely some of the best tamales I've ever had.  If they weren't so small, I would give them 5 stars.  Front counter person could be a little nicer too.   Very limited hours, but pretty close to my house, so I'm happy about that.  We will DEFINITELY be back.

The sandwiches here are always fresh and tasty, vegies are also fresh, the restaurant is clean, and the service is great.  If you are in the neighborhood and want to go to a Subway for a quick sub, this is a great place to go.

I love this place.  Parking is ok, though many times you have to park really far away, but you can always find a place.  This Mall (Tempe Marketplace) has so much to do and so many places to eat and shop.  And Harkins has a soda cup.  Theatre is fairly new, seats and bathrooms are clean too.  Great place to go see a movie.

I am not familiar with Indian food at all.   But I bought a groupon for this place because it was close.   So we went last night.  We both got a lamb dish and the garlic naan.   Mild spice.  I have heard Indian food is very spicy so wanted to make sure we could eat it.  It was fantastic.   I mean I'm still thinking about it today good, and had the leftovers for breakfast. .  Service was good.  It concerns me that it wasn't very busy.  Sure would hate to see it go out of business.   The food is that good.  Go try it.  I'm serious.

This place is about 2 miles from my house, I have driven past it at least 100 times in all the years I've been living here, yet I have never stopped...until they offered a Groupon.  I LOVE YOU, GROUPON!    We walked in the door, and the hostess greeted us immediately and sat us.  What an adorable place, very clean, low lighting, but not so low you can't see anything.  And the food, oh my, the food.  I had a stuffed chile rellano, so good.  And pumpkin flan, even better.  This is an adorable place with good service, fantastic food.  A little expensive for Mexican food, but definitely worth it.

This was my first time for pho.  In fact, my friends don't even know about it because I texted someone who wanted to know where I was "eating pho" and they thought I meant to say "eating ho".  That's a term of endearment between me and a few of my friends.  This place is no more than 2 miles from my house, and I had never been there.  Wow, what I was missing.  We got the pho with beef in it.  We had them leave out the tripe and the tendons.  Gross.  They brought us some herbs, lime wedges and bean sprouts.  This certainly wasn't the ramen my daughter, Princess Megan, has on a regular basis.  The meat was nice and tender and flavorful, the noodels were tasy and plentiful, and the broth, oh the broth.  Best soup broth I've ever had.  I had put some of the hoisin (sp?) sauce in my soup, which gave it a nice little kick.    Service brought this from a 5 star review to a 4 star review.  Really left something to be desired, but that in itself wouldn't stop me from coming back to this lovely place.

This place was great.  Me and my coworkers went there today.  I got a Chicken Schwarma, my two friends got a salad, and the twhc was to die for.  Service was a little slow, but hey, it's right across the street from MCC.  And it was on the lunch hour.  Can you say "packed to the gills"?  It was.  The food was fresh and good tasting, the mahi (which I've had before and is my favorite) was so good, cooked well, and came with some wonderful pasta salad.  I love this place.

I had a groupon to this place, so we went last Saturday.  I have to say I wasn't expecting much, but I love Mexican food, grew up on it, as I was born and raised in Az, and it's my favorite, so I'm always willing to eat a taco or a burrito, even a bad one.  So we start out with chips and salsa.  I have to say, I was very surprised by how spicy it was!  My daughter got the mild salsa, but mine and the bean dip put a fire in my belly that was unexpected and pleasing to my palate!    I got a red chili burrito with green sauce and rice and beans.  My daughter got a chicken burrito with red sauce and rice and beans.  Megan's food was probably a 3, chicken was ok.  But mine was divine!  The meat was in large meaty chunks, very lean and tender.  The sauce was very spicy, and the green sauce on top also was very spicy and had a great taste.   Beans tasted good and were also very spicy.  The only thing that was just ok was the rice.  I ate it, but it was just ok.  And the service was also great.  Lots of diet coke refills because of the spicy food.  I would go back to this place in a heartbeat again and again.

My daughter and I went there on Saturday night.  The place wasn't very busy, only one other table taken.  We sat down and were immediately greeted by the waitress.  She was very helpful, explained the menu to me, and was also very patient as I had never had Indian food before.  My daughter and I both got a chicken dish, Chicken Tikki Masala and Tandoori Chicken  Megan's was a boneless chicken and mine had bones in.  Both were pretty spicy, which surprised me, didn't really expect that, but what did I know, it was all new to me.  They were both very good, and I did enjoy them.  We also got rice and naan, which was ok, and she brought us out some sauces, the best being the Mint Chutney.  That one little sauce was my favorite thing out of the whole meal.  I would spread it on toast and eat it if I could!    All in all, I really enjoyed this place.  If we are in the neighborhood I would definitely drop in again, not only for the food, but for the fantastic service.  The service, if I could rate it separately, would get a 5plus in my book!

I love taco Tuesdays at Filibertos, and this is the one closest to my house.  I  usually go to the one on Main and Dobson, and had forgotten about this one.  So this last Tuesday I go here to get my regular order of tacos.  They are very crunchy, cheesy taco goodness.  Every bit as good as my favorite Filibertos, maybe even better.  This may just become my regular Filibertos!

Had some tacos on taco Tuesday yesterday and immediately got an upset stomach.  Woke up this morning and was in the bathroom more than once.  Don't think I'll be going back here unless I want to have the same brown issue.

My daughter and I were in Fiesta Mall waiting for some eyeglasses to be made, so we wondered down to the food court.  We had a coupon for this place, and it's' as good as any other in this old outdated mall.  They dip the dogs right before they cook them, so that's a good thing.  But the dogs came out and they were really greasy, so that tells me either the grease is really old, it's not hot enough, or both.  We also got some churros, and I think I had a small heart attack after I ate them, they were so greasy.  I guess if you are hard up for something to eat, then this would be your place.

It's a lazy Sunday afternoon, and I'm looking through my Groupons, figuring out where I'm going for an early dinner today.  Now I live in West Mesa, and don't want to drive very far, but I have promised myself that I'm going to start using my Groupons as they expire, and this one was the next.  It's only about 12 miles, so Megan and I say, what the heck, let's go.    The minute you walk in you feel welcome at this place.  Peanuts on the floor, lots of TVs, lots of regulars, comfortable booths, and they greet you as soon as you walk in the door.  Our server was Sabrina (I think) and she was great start to finish.  From the moment we walked in the door through  extra stuff requested and refills too.  Always there, but not in your face.    I had a Turkey Dip Sandwich with the steak fries and a salad.  Megan had the French Dip Sandwich with curly fries and a salad, with two large diet Pepsi (wishing for Coke).  Bread was ok, turkey tasted great.  Steak fries were good.  Didn't really care for the turkey au jus that was served with the turkey, so didn't use that much.  Megan's French Dip sandwich was great all the way down to the au jus.   She really liked the curly fries,  The only complaint I had on this place was the ranch dressing was not cold...maybe it was just made, I'm not sure?  But I like cold dressing on my salad.    Food was good, but I have to tell you what would bring me back was the atmosphere.  Loved this place, and will drive to it again!

Bargain basement pizza at bargain basement prices.  About on the scale of Little Caesars.  I'm not a big pizza fan, so pizza has to be Fan Freakin Tastic for me to go back, and this place just wasn't.  Service was ok, kind of a dumpy little place.  But you know what really got me.  As I was eating, I saw one of the people in the back dump some Frozen Tyson Wings in their prep trays.  So if you really like these people's wings, save yourself some money and go to the grocery store and buy Tyson's, cuz you are getting exactly the same thing.   I thought that was pretty crappy.

I was on Yelp looking for some good places to eat , someplace with good reviews.    And I ran across this place.  Now, it was quite a ways to drive, but I figured, what the heck.  It was, without a doubt, the best Chinese Buffet I have ever been to.  The food is fresh and cooked just right.  The sushi bar is really good and fresh.  The fresh fruit is pentiful and fresh.  Even the baked steamed fish is good.  I am a big crab puff person, and the amount of filling in these was amazing.  I will go back to this place over and over again.  Anyone reading this, it's worth the drive!

This was, without a doubt, the nastiest pizza I have ever had in my life, thin cardboard like crust, probably imitation cheese, hardly any toppings on the pizza, just gross and tasteless.   The only bright spot was the brownies.  Pretty hard to screw up a chocolate brownie.  And the clientele. oh my.  One old man, had to be in his 60's, had a plaid shirt with no sleeves and was unbuttoned almost to his waist.   Copious amounts of grey chest hair sticking out of his shirt, and it looked like a forrest on his upper arms....at least he looked clean, which is more than I can say for other people in here.  Someone could buy me dinner and I wouldn't go back to this F___g gross place....

Went in for a tobacoo test (if you dont' smoke, your insurance goes down at my job).  They got me right in, parking was close, and the people were very friendly.  All in all, a very good experience.  I wouldn't hesitate to go back here if I was in the area.

I made an appointment with this young man, and he did a great job.   Did exactly what I asked him to do, the tint looks really really good, and he charged me a very fair price.  AND he came to my house.  What more could you ask for?  Call him, you will be pleased.  Isn't it amazing how much different your car looks when the windows are tinted?

Really good burritos, and they're huge.  The red chili burrito was meaty, juice, had a great flavor.  I looked around and saw people eating some wonderful looking seafood.  I will try that when I go back again.

My daughter and I just went here, it's right down the street from my house, and I had a Groupon, so it was well worth my time.  And we weren't disappointed in any way.  Megan had the chicken fingers, which were real pieces of chicken, not that formed crap you get at some restaurants, and curly fries. Chicken was crunchy, hot, and had a great taste.   Came with a side of ranch dressing, which was really really good.  Has to be homemade.  I had a steak sandwich with peppers, onions, and provolone cheese.  Bread was soft and fresh, steak was flavorful and plentiful and the mushrooms and onions were really good.      So we've established that the food was fantastic.  Now let's talk about the service.  Top notch.  Friendly, helpful, service was great.  Asked me several times if everything was ok.    Some guys came in and got the two pieces of pizza and a soda.  Huge pieces of pizza  and a soda for around $5.00. From my table the pizza looked great.   Can't wait to come and try the pizza.    When my daughter and I go out to eat, I always ask her if she wants to come again.  Yesterday we went to Baja Fresh, which was nasty nasty.  I asked Megan as we were leaving, do you want to come again, and she said no.  Today I asked her if she wants to come again to Spacolis, and she said yes.  And we will come back, soon.  If you live anywhere near this place (Dobson and Southern in Mesa) please go.  Have to support the little businesses.  Especially ones like this.    Thanks Spacolis for the awesome food and the great service.

Wow, the food is good in here.  We went on a late Saturday afternoon and I got a chicken pita sandwich and my daughter got a turkey sandwich.  I have been to a few places where the sandwiches were just plain boring.  You can't say that abou this place.  They were very tasty, fresh, the chicken and turkey were tender, pretty sure they make it in house.  And the customer service was great.  Lots of ASU students in there studying, and they were nice and quiet and respectful of the other customers in the restaurant.  The guy behind the counter looks like he's standing on a box because he is 6'8".  I would definitely go back to this place, if you are in the neighborhood, or even if you're not, it is great.

Went there yesterday and got a sub, it was great.  Bread is the best, real chewy, almost sourdough like, without being stale.   People making my sandwich were really nice and friendly, cute too!    I got a number 8....don't remember the name of it.  The only downside is I didn't eat it right away and it got a little soggy because there's a lot of mayonnaise on it.  Don't get me wrong, I like a lot of mayonnaise, so I didn't have a problem with it.  Just didn't know it would get soggy if it sat.  The solution to this problem, eat that sub as soon as you get it..and I will.  I'll be back, Jimmy Johns!

Food was great.  But the real reason for this five star review, the service.  I went with a friend of mine who is a certified pain in the ass when it comes to what she wants at a restaurant.  Special orders everything, and asks for all kinds of extras.  I mean she runs this poor server ragged.  Me and my daughter did a little bit too, so this guy was going for this and going for that, and they were busy too, so he had lots of tables.   And he never, not once, let us down.  All the way down to extra mint chocolates and bread sticks to take home.  Never sat without my drink glass full either, which is one of my pet peeves.   I know people think "I don't go to OG because it is a chain restaurant"  But I love this place.  And it is my daughter's favorite place to eat.   We will be back.

I have been coming here for a while now, and really really like the doctors, who are both female.   They are super nice, take the time to talk to you as long as you need them to.  The office staff, on the other hand, suck.     Two days ago I went in for a blood test so I could get my scrips refilled.  I haven't been feeling well, and have gained some weight, and really didn't want to weigh, so I told them that.  They told me "it's policy, and if you don't weigh, we can't see you."  I refused again, (I'm the one paying their bills, aren't i?)  So finally got to see the doctor, did a blood test, etc, and never was FORCED to weigh in.      So they called me the next day, wanted to see me for results of the blood test (which means a problem), so I make an appointment for the next day.   So I go in today for results from the blood test, and what do you know, the Nazi office personnel want me to weigh again.  I tell them no, just in for my bloodwork results, so they show me to my room.  Then the bitch from hell, (Michelle, I think, wish I remembered her name), comes back and tells me if I don't weigh, they can't see me.  I tell her I was there two days ago and I was able to see them without weighing, has office policy changed in the last two days?  She says  yes, then refuses to tell me her bosses name, says, and I quote, "I'm the boss, and there's no one above me".  So I ask her for her bosses name again, and she refuses to give it to me, just flat out says I'm not giving it to you.  Then she lied to me again  and tells me the doctor says she won't see me unless I weigh in.  Are you kidding me?  . Doctor comes in the room and flat told me that she never said she wouldn't see me.     So let's count the lies.  1, She's the boss and there's no one above her.  2.  Office policy has changed in two days.  3.  Doctor will not see you unless you weigh in.    All in all, a lousy experience.  What happened to customer care?  This office needs to fire almost all of the people that work there. The girl (Michelle?) was just flat out a nasty bitch.  Hope you're reading this, Michelle.  I would be willing to bet I'm not the first one to think this of you.  The only reason this is getting two stars instead of one is the doctors are so great.    Beware the office staff, if you don't do exactly what they want you to do, watch out.  If you can get past them, the doctors are great.

I'm serious, anyone reading this thinking about going to this doctor's office, please reconsider.  The office staff are some of the rudest and most incompetent people I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with. Down from 2 stars to 1.  Ok, here goes.  I have a new job, and don't go there anymore (thankfully), but am going in for surgery, and the doctor that is doing it requires medical records from 2 years back (I last saw them in  April 2012).  So I have been told in the past, oh, no problem, when you need us to, we will email the new doctor your records.  So I am finally able to get started, got my approval from my family doctor (which only lasts a month) send over to the surgeon, and I called Desert Grove on Monday and left them a message about faxing me the form so I can fill it out and have the records emailed over.   And I hear nothing, and don't receive the form faxed over as requested on their voice mail.  So I call again yesterday.  What do you know, their voice mail box for requesting medical records is full.  So I call again today, and yes, you got it, it's still full.  So I call back and was able to get a real person, and I told her the voice mail was full, and she says to me "let me find her" and transfers me over, you guessed it, to the same full mail box.    At this point, I'm ready to pull my hair out.  So I call back again and get some dumbass down there who tells me I can come down and pay them $35 for the records, but I can't get them to send MY medical records over to another doctor after I fill out a form for MY MEDICAL RECORDS.    Seriously, I'm so pissed off right now, it's a good thing I can't go down there right now and it wouldn't be pretty.    Don't go here, I'm serious.  And if you have any questions, please feel free to send me a message over yelp.  I wish I could picket them.

People  here are super nice, place is spotlessly clean and chairs are very comfortable.  Yogurt is also really good, lots of flavors, lots of toppings.  I'm a big tart yogurt fan, and they always have a couple very tart flavors.  Also have Marshmallow cream topping, which is my favorite.  Well worth your while, but bring your wallet, it's expensive!

This place is great.  Very fresh  and high quality ingredients, very laid back atmosphere,  It's in a strip mall on the sw corner of Alma School and Baseline.  It's convenient to get in and out of, parking is good.   My egg and red chili breakfast burrito was really really good.  This place is about 1.5 miles from my house and I had no idea it was even there.  I bet there lunch is really good too.  Fast service too.  A great place for businesses to stop in for lunch.  I know I'll be back.

My daughter and I had a couple of the beef and lamb gyros.  They were wonderful.  The meat was tender and juicy,  the bread was soft and pliable.  The only thing that I could find wrong was the tazeki sauce could have used some more spices, it was kind of blah.  We would go back.  Service was great too.

We went in there before a movie the other day and got a couple cheeseburgers and split an order of fries.  Of course, I had a groupon.  The girl at the front desk was ok, restaurant was a little messy, but they were pretty busy, so I let that go.  The cheeseburgers were divine.  Just greasy enough to be juicy but not gross.  French fries were ok, nothing special, but not horrible either.  And it's right outside one of my favorite movie theatres, so that was definitely a bonus.   Cheeseburgers though were definitely a step above the average run of the mill one.  I just started a diet so no more cheeseburgers for me...I'll miss you, Smashburger (sob...)

I got a baja burrito and tortilla was overdone and the steak was cold. Girl behind the counter was very nice, but not real bright.  I asked her what time they closed and she had no clue.  I think she was too busy flirting with the cook to really give a sh__.

I had purchased a Groupon for this restaurant, decided to buy it about 20 minutes before time ran out, and I am so GLAD I did.  Now I have lived in Arizona all my life, from the Globe/Miami area, and I have had more Mexican food than any other kind when it comes to restaurant food.  It's my favorite and I'm pretty easy to please.  I give most mexican restaurants are a 3 or a 4 rating, probably closer to 4.    This one far exceeds most of them.  I rated a mexican restaurant last week a 5, as it was very good and customer service was great.  This place, customer service was great as well, but the food, oh, the food.  I'm serious, at least the top 3 of the best I've ever had.  I would rate it a 10 if I could.    I had a chili verde burrito with beans and cheese added in and my daughter had the carne asada nachos.  Mine came with rice and beans.  Rice and beans were very good.  So many times rice in mexican food restaurants has no flavor.  This time the flavor was great.  But what really set this place apart was the meat.  My pork was so tender and flavorful, not sure what they cooked it in, but I am still thinking about that meal today.  And Megan's beef on her nachos had that same wonderful flavor and was every bit as tender.  I would love to get the recipe for whatever they marinade their meat in.     The toppings on Megan's nachos were very generous, lots of cheese, sour cream and guacamole on the side, pico de gallo too, which was great.  I asked for a sample of some of the hot sauce they had and our waiter came out with 3 shot glasses with hot sauce in them so I could try a few different ones.    This experience was top notch from start to finish.  Restaurant was clean and nicely decorated too.  I didn't go in bathroom, only thing I didn't check out.  See you soon, Rico!

They are closed and I am sad.  Wonderful restaurant, first rate customer service, and food was the best.

Salty carmel was great, so different that I've ever had, and had it with some lemon.  What a great combination.  the lady there even let me use my Groupon that I had bought for their Mesa location.  She was really nice and i do appreciate the great service and wonderful gelato.

Went there on Saturday, with my Groupon in hand, and got a burger with avocado, jalapenos, and cheese on it, medium.  My, my it was tasty.  Now, I'm not a big burger fan, I mean, they're ok, but if I have a choice, I almost always choose something else.  But for some reason, I chose one that day, and I have to say I was very pleased.  It was cooked perfectly, a little pink in the middle, very fresh vegies on it.  One of the best burgers I've ever had, without a doubt.  And sweet potato tots on the side, that's right, sweet potato.  I would give it a 5 on Saturday.  It was so good that we went back today for taco Tuesday.    Today, not as good.  We pretty much got ignored most of the time we were there.  And they weren't that busy, not sure what the waitresses were doing, as I hardly ever saw them.  Never asked how my daughter wanted her burger cooked, came out well done.  My tacos were good, probably a 3.5.   But I don't feel the need to go running back like I did on Saturday.    So I'm going to split the difference and give this place a 4.  But I hate to be ignored.   I will go back for the burger, but not real soon.  Sure hope I get a different waitress though.....

Went there again last night for the burger.  Supposed to come out on toasted buns, it didn't.  Medium, was medium rare.  And once again I was almost ignored by the waitress, and had to wait about 10 minutes for my check even though we were obviously done.  And the noise, so noisy, couldn't really carry on a conversation.  I won't be back.

This restaurant originated in Heber.  I spent lots of time up here as a teenager, and Heber brings back lots of good memories, so I liked this place before I ever set foot in the door, and when I did, oh my.    This place is fan freakin tastic.  Food was great, service was great,  there was even a mariachi band on Saturday night.    The amount of food you get, we both had another meal the next day.  We both got the taco, cheese enchilada and red burrito plate that comes with rice and beans.   Red chili meat was plentiful, very tender and tasty.  Taco had lots of tender juicy shredded beef.  But the best part of this plate was the cheese enchilada.  OMG it was good.  The enchilada sauce was definitely homemade.  I plan to go back to this place soon.   Rice and beans were good too.  Hot sauce was very spicy, and they had another option that wasn't as spicy too.  And we both got a soda.  Bill was under $27.    I'm serious, try it.

I love Groupons, has led me to some fabulous places that I never would have found otherwise.  And also some not so fabulous places  This one was the first kind.  Huge fresh salads, wonderful service.  The panini I got was ok, hence the 4 stars instead of 5.   But the cupcakes, oh, the cupcakes.  We got a few different ones, but the one that really stood out was the filled red velvet.  I'm not sure what the filling was, but I dreamed about it last night it was so good.  Gonna take my boss there next week for her birthday too.  That's how great this place was.  Highly highly recommended.  They close at 6pm and are closed on Sundays.  Can't wait to go try something else, but definitely will be getting one of those cupcakes!

Hotdogs were no better, in fact worse, than would come out of my microwave.  What a total and complete waste of my time going all the way out here.  Bought a groupon, as I love hotdogs.  Won't be making another trip here, that's for sure.

This place is closed, has been for a while now, supposed to be opening back up next month as a greek restaurant, yet they are still offering the $10 for $20 deal, and it comes up as a special deal on Groupon too.  Something stinks here.  Methinks the owner is getting some cash for this deal, maybe to pay for his new restaurant?  If you don't believe me, call the number listed on the address, it even tell you this.

I saw Beaver Choice profiled a long time ago on Eden Eats and always wanted to try it.  I was driving to work one day and drove right past the new place, and was so excited.  It is literally 3 minutes from my house and about 5 minutes from where I work.  Heck, I even emailed the owner to ask when it would be open.  And got a very nice email back too.    So last Saturday, me, my daughter and my friend went in and got seated right away.  The waiter was pretty good too.  Good start  We got the fries with cheese and gravy to start.  It was ok, but most importantly, fresh, and hot.  Then our dinner came, and it was a different story.    I got the stuffed chicken, mashed potatoes, salad and cole slaw.  My daughter got a hamburger, medium, and salad.  And my friend got meatballs, mashed potatoes and cole slaw.  The mashed potatoes were cold.  My daughter's hamburger was well done, and the bun was ice cold.  The dressing on the salad was tasteless as well.  Not horrible, but definitely room for improvement.  So we have cold food and an incorrectly cooked meat.  But you know what the clencher was?  We called the owner over and told her the food was cold.  She didn't say a word, and walked away, never to return.  Didn't offer to reheat the food, maybe throw in a dessert, nothing.  But she was sure greeting people with hugs when they walked in the door, prior customers I think.   You'd think she'd work a little harder to keep new customers.  After all, wasn't that why she moved, to expand her business?  Guess what?  I live close, and also work at a very close and large office building.  We go out to lunch a lot.  You better believe I won't be back, and won't bring any of my friends and coworkers in either.   There's never an excuse for poor customer service, especially by the "OWNER" of the restaurant.  A waiter, usually nothing to lose.  The owner has everything to lose.  I hope she reads this.

This place sucks.   Donuts are stale and overpriced.  Front counter person is rude,  and the prices seem to be a bit "flexible".  There is also fake reviews for them on Yelp.    Count your change.
