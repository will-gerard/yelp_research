Great food and great service. I go to ASU, went here between classes for lunch and was more then satisfied with the food, price, and service.

Came in at happy hour and the bartender was extremely rude. The food is mediocre and is well over priced for what you get (hence why i go only for happy hour). The restaurant is under staffed and is not very accommodating. Try Rusconi's across the street much better.
