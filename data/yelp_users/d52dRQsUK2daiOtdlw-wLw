Outstanding service.  Friendly and accommodating.  They treat you like old friends even the first time you go.  I personally like the smallish atmosphere.  Food is wonderful!  Love the spicy tuna salad!

One of the BEST dining experiences...EVER!  Start with a martini and oysters. End with a chocolate martini and strawberry shortcake with fresh berries!

Really? Giving a dentist a 5-star rating? If anything is ridiculous, this is!   My past left me painfully scarred--physically and emotionally. Nearly 10 years ago, my husband (who knows I don't allow others to take care of me) forced me to see Dr. Wiitala.   It had been years since I had been in a dentist's chair, but I'll never be in any other dentist's chair again.  Dr. Wiitala gets a 5-star for all the other reasons the reviewers list AND for putting up with the likes of me!

Food was marginal....Sunday brunch.  Prices were stupid.  And I felt like I  was in a New Orleans' night club...on Sunday morning.  Ick

Are you kidding me? This is absolutely the best MED SPA experience I've ever had. Scottsdale is SATURATED with spas, but this one beats them all...hands down. Why? Not only are the services the latest and greatest, but the professionals here truly care about your AFTER care experience.   Scottsdale can be intimidating, but not in this spa. The staff is very friendly, warm and down-to-earth....all the while...offering the most state-of-the-art services.  I accidentally found this spa and was so happy that I did!  I am a keeper and a member now!
