I was searching for a pair of Costa Sunglasses and located the Arizona Hiking Shack via Costa. These Amazing sunglasses are hard to find in Phoenix. Their selection of technical clothing was also impressive. True specialty shops are a rare find these days. I intend on supporting these professionals!

THEY HAD A OPPORTUNITY TO DO THE "RIGHT-THING".  Dropped 4 items to be laundered and pressed. Dropped off at 10:30 on a Wednesday. Their staff member told me they would be ready after 4:00pm the next day. I showed at 4:30 and was told to return an hour later because my order was not finished. So I headed out again in our first 112 degree day. Returned at 5:30. Requested them to "comp" one shirt. A discount of $2.42 on a bill of $12.31. Politely made the request to RAMIRO the manager. Mind you; 112 degrees out. And had to make a second trip for the stuff. I was denied. I thought that was a fair and reasonable request for Paris Laundry not doing what they had promised.

I have conducted business with this shop for years. But am done, for the following reasons. They have two mechanics; young with no formal training. Unfortunately the lead mechanic passed away. With 3 people in administration, this company is "TOP" heavy. Mike plays the role of a service advisor; with no prior automotive experience. The general manager; Jim Johnson, pays the bills; and stays out of operations. And the owner, Steve, is hard to find. Spending very little time at his shop. Steve prepared a written estimate for work to be performed on my new purchase. A 2008 VW Touareg. Here he researched and wrote an estimate for oil cooler hose replacement. Parts and labor to be $217.17 The actual amount I paid for this procedure was $327.84. Charging me 30% more than estimated. The primary problem lies in the attitude I received from the employee's. I gave the shop a week to do the work; I was out of town on business. In addition to the hoses, I asked for a light bulb to be replaced. That was not done, when I was there to pick up my Touareg. So the mechanic (Andrew) said he would pop one in for me before I left. "Said he did not know which bulb I needed". Ask Mike to look it up. Mike acted like I was putting him out, by making this request and "would not help me". So I walked back to Andrew and told him Mike was not helping. Andrew then pulled out the bulb. Matched it from their inventory and replaced it. Andrew then told me what a great deal I got on getting my oil hoses replaced. He said "the book calls for 3 hours and we only charged you for 2 hours". I then asked him. How long did it actually take? He answered, " 2 hours". He told me to settle up with Mike on the bill and there was "no-charge" for installing the bulb. I proceeded to Mike. He helped everyone in the lobby, but me. I was left there; awkwardly waiting to pay the bill. It is obvious he does not like his job or me; or both. Finally. He presented the bill. Adding $10.00 labor and $16.91 for the bulb. $26.91. This bulb; a Halogen-Low Beam /55W, sells for $10.54 everywhere else. I then mentioned that Andrew said there was no charge for installing the bulb. Mike threw a fit. Went outside. Scolded Andrew. Andrew changed his story. I was charged $26.91 for a bulb, bundled with the installation.;  In conclusion: I was over-charged $130.00 for the hose and bulb replacements. And treated like shit along the way. I will NO longer do business here. They have lost this long time customer and friend. All the detail in this case is verifiable via receipts and the written estimate prior to service.
