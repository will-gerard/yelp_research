Gilbert was awesome. Highly recommend him- he really listened to what I needed worked on and helped get rid of so many of my knots. Great fir medium to deep pressure.

Sharma was one of the best massage therapists I've had in a long time- and I get massages at some of the most high end resorts/spa. She used techniques that were completely unique to me ( that were amazing) and also told me why she was doing it/ why it helped. She was very informational and even showed me some stretches I can do to help alleviate some of my neck and back pain. Def recommend her!

I had such an amazing experience at Lillian Lottie! Meghan was so helpful/informational and has such a great attitude. She made shopping for my both my wedding dress and bridesmaids dresses so much fun. Couldn't have had a better experience. Highly recommended!!

Do not order for delivery from this location. This is the second time I've ordered from here and have waited an hour and a half for my food...

Jimmi and her husband are the sweetest people ever, and truly love pets. It is so nice to not have to board the dogs- instead, then can stay in our home with visits from them a few times a day. We are so lucky we found them to pet sit our two dogs- one of which is part pit bull and quite hyper!! They sent us pictures of the pups while we were away and we're very accommodating. Will definitely be using them in the future!!

I am so happy this place opened! I have not enjoyed any of the other salons around and this place is great. It's clean, comfortable and also affordable. All the technicians are very nice and the manager truly cares. Their pedicures are great and they do a hot towel and hot stones after the leg massage!
