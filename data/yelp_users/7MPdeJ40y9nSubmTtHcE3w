I have the fast pass, it means that we can wash our cars as many times as we want and its a good thing because the car washes suck. i don't know if their vacuum is broken or what but my car never looks vacuumed afterwards. Also the inside store clerks are rude and I heard them talking about how "us" Scottsdale people are so rude. I was very disappointed and will be cancelling my fast pass.
