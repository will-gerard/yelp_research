What a great atmosphere with great coffee and great food.  My wife and I shared One of their breakfast burritos.  It was fantastic!  You could tell all of the ingredients were fresh.  I had a mud clod to drink.  A mix of white and dark chocolate perfectly balanced at the perfect drinking temperature. The shop was clean and comfortable with several different seating options.  The staff is great, taking time to interact with each of their guests.  This is by far one of my favorite coffee shops in the Valley.

Great looking restaurant.  It was very clean and provides a great atmosphere in line with the Scottsdale culture.  We were greeted promptly and sat according to our preference.  Our waitress came by in a reasonable amount of time to take our drink order.  After she took our drink order it took and excessive amount of time for her to come back for our food order.  My wife and I gave her our food order specifically requesting soy paper instead of seaweed stating the fact that I don't like seaweed.  Our food arrived in an appropriate amount of time.  One of the rolls, the dragon roll, came out with seaweed, and we had to send it back.  We had to ask were the tempura shrimp was in the tempura shrimp roll.  The ratio of shrimp to crab and cucumber was way way off.  As far as the food itself the size of each piece of sushi is 3 to 4 times the size of any normal sushi roll.  This made it impossible to eat with chopsticks in one bite.  I enjoy sushi for the combination of flavors in each piece of sushi and to have to eat a piece on multiple bites makes it so you only get part of the ingredients per bite.  The bill, yikes!  They uncharged $1 for the soy paper which is normal.  Almost $70 for 3 rolls at lunch time!  Overall, the food was mediocre, the size of the rolls was abnormal, the ratio of ingredients was way way off, the price was high, and the service was terrible.
