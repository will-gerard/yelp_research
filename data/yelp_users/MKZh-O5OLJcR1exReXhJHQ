The service here was good. Unfortunately, the food here, like other Spinato's locations I've been to over the years, was bland, bland, bland. In the area, the location was convenient for the time that we had to give. On this trip we tried a Sicilian pepperoni pizza (excessively oily) and a MaMa's signature calzone (wet and runny, not moist). While there are worse places to eat, there are certainly better.

I've been shopping at this location for years and have never had anything negative to say, until now. I tried to return a $7 shirt to this Target location the day after Christmas. The woman at the return desk would not allow me to return the shirt (understandable, I had no receipt) AND wouldn't give me a store credit even though the item still had all the tags on it. The explanation from this woman was "Target will not permit more than $75 worth of returns in 1 calendar year. Based on my DL I had made several returns in 2013 (of course I had I live nearby and frequent this story) and those returns prevented them from doing anything to help me.   Considering they've compromised my personal credit with their IT incompetence you'd think they bend over backwards to accommodate their customer base. I'm very disappointed in Target and will never look at them the same way again.

Good food served up quickly at a reasonable price. We had the spicy teriyaki chicken bowl (best I've tasted) , the California rolls (very good) and two egg rolls - all were very tasty. The establishment is clean and without many frills, the staff is friendly and quick. Who could ask for more?

I went there tonight to hear live music. I arrived at 6:50 and ended up leaving by 7:15. I never even saw a waitress. Even though the layout is identical to how I remember it when the space was the Native New Yorker it was kept very dark and had a well worn feel to it. What I heard of the music was top notch. Unfortunately, the sound was absorbed by the wall and the seating...lets just say it was all but impossible to see the band. Can't see the band, can't hear the band well, no service - Thats too many strikes for me. I left without spending a cent in the place. Shame. The band was impressive.

Be wary..count you change. The food and drink were well enough. What stands out the most was the assumption that it was okay to take $1 without asking - aka stealing.  My bill came to $5.05 a NY Hot dog and a medium lime limeade. I gave the car hop $20.05. She said she needed to go inside to make change. Knowing that the car hops rely on tips, and despite waiting a ridiculous amount of time for my order, I gave the girl $1 tip before she could run away and before I counted my change - big mistake. After handing her $1 I had $13  in change. Calling her through the microphone I explained the situation. She offered no apology, saying she needed to go inside to make change.  Bad Service. Dishonest. Shameful. Unapologetic. Thoroughly arrogant or just plain stupid.  I'm sure its just one person: Ticket 387, 9/18/15 @21:36 cashier SH-O, Keyboard K-1

My wife and I waited for a while to be seated despite several tables being open and cleaned. The regulars, who came in several minutes after us, are catered to by the staff (several parties were seated as we were but their tables had chips and salsa already waiting and they received their service at the same time we did). The food itself was good but lacked spice. I wasn't impressed but I wasn't unimpressed either. It is just an OK place to eat. Next time we'll drive a few more miles.

Good food and great entertainment. I go here nearly every Tuesday night. My son's guitar instructor hosts Tuesday Blues Day at Padre Murphy's. You want an excellent value grab a snack (nachos and wings are good) have a beer or two and listen to live blues music by a masterful guitarist and his students and musician friends (sax players, singers, blue harpists, etc..). To date, and I've been here fairly regularly for several months, I haven't had any bad food or service (though the meet the devil chicken wings weren't as intimidating as they name implied).

I went to Carrabba's last night for a birthday celebration. Being raised in an Italian house I have no preconceived notion that ANY commerial Italian food restaurant will satisfy my tastebuds - Carrabba's did not change this assessment. I had the Chicken and Spinich Cannelloni with Sausage Lental Soup. The innars of the Cannelloni lacked seasioning and was overshadowed by the sweetness of the equally unseasoned sauce. The Sausage Lental soup, for me, was the best part of the meal but was over peppered (black pepper). The bread served at the table wasn't removly crusty and appeared to be brown a serve (and not browned, i might add).  Service: The wait staff was well intentioned but obviously not up to serving a party of 14 quickly. I had to wait for drinks, seasoning for my olive oil, and then the bill (about $70).  I would not recommend this place..though, as I said, I'm accustomed to better italian food. Besides, I make better italian food myself (thanks Mom).

We went here on July 4th for dinner and between the 7 of us we spent a little over $110. Between us we tried quite a bit of the menu, I personally tried the Classic Calzone (very good), my son had the Chicago Fire calzone, we all shared the pepperoni rolls. Everything we ordered was tasty. The waitress was attentive but not overly so. We will go back again.

I stopped in because I never tried a fish taco. I ended up buying the Cabo Platter, a fish taco and a shrimp burrito. The Fish Taco's breading was way overcooked to the point of burned - I couldn't taste or feel the texture of the fish my first two bites. The Shrimp Burrito was delicious.  While I would go back again I'd probably avoid another fish taco as a result of this. Overall, it was a good eating experience and I would return.

I have to start out by saying I was raised in a 3rd generation  Italian household and that some in my extended family spoke only Italian. Further, I, myself, can cook very good Italian food based on my exposure to my family.  My wife and I went to Anzios  mainly because we've driven past it a number of times, we had a credit with Groupon and wanted eat out.  Eggplant Parmigiana - Eggplant was cut to thick and slightly undercooked. The pasta was cooked well but the sauce lacked any direction.  Side salad - basically a small potion of lettuces and shaved carrots on a plate.  Meatball Hero - Sauce was bland. Meatballs were small, tasted like meat and bread crumbs, were heavy and lacked any real flavor. While the sauce on the meatball hero was different than the eggplant parmigiana it too was bland and lacked direction.  Because of my history with Italian food I deliberately avoid "Italian" restaurants and if I do go to one I set my expectations pretty low. While the food was fair I don't think I will be going back to Anzios.

I took my son to this place because the name is reputable and its literally less than a half-mile from my home. That said, I would drive several miles for eyewear to avoid coming back. This is the SLOWEST and, for the most part, least welcoming eyeglass business I have ever seen. Day 1 - arrived at 4:15 for a 4:30 eye exam, met the doctor for the exam at 5:05,  After the exam we spoke with the doctor and had to wait to be checked out. We looked at all the frame offerings several times only to get disgusted with the wait to pay and left at 6:10. Ridiculous. Day 2 - went back at 10:30a to pay, thinking it the slowness was an one time thing, signed in and waited for someone to serve us. The process of paying took a long while and we had to compete with phone calls and were assaulted with constant up-sales opportunities. We finally got out of the place at 11:50am. Under impressed is being polite.

After not visting this place for as while, my family and I vistited Ming's (a long time favorite of ours) only to find it under new management. I have to say as good as Ming's was previously this new cook and staff has only made it better. We had Kung Pao Beef, Seseme Chicken and Fried Rice...each were absolutely delicious, surpassing the same meals at this establishment previously. The staff was friendly and attentive (not that that was ever an issue here). I did notice their taven was closed. If you've been before and liked it, I suggest go again and LOVE it.

We stopped in for a light lunch and was pleasantly surprised to get a seat quickly despite the place being packed. The service was attentive and quick. I never had to notice that my glass was empty. The biscuits were tasty as always and the food was delicious (a variety of shrimp, stuffed mushrooms, and salads)

In a desert world even a muddy puddle  can be welcoming. So goes my feelings toward this Starbucks. I typically avoid Starbucks because of the burnt coffee and their franchise's political leanings. But sometimes they are the only place around. The wifi at this establishment was very bad, uncharacteristically so - it kept dropping every few minutes, streaming music or video was out of the question and IM was all but impossable. The service was fair at best, the coffee was as expected, and they began telling people to leave several minutes before their posted closing time. If in the area again...I WOULDN'T GO BACK.

I hadn't visited this place in about five years. Once again, I really enjoyed everything tasted at this restaurant.  The fare is a fusion of Chinese, Mexican and Jamaican flavors. First, I was offered samples of all the major items to try.  I selected  the Jade Red chicken, the black beens with cumin, and the Jerk Chicken (been to Jamaica, ate their jerk chicken while there, Chino Bandidio's was pretty darn good) - all were packed with flavor and delicious.The staffing was helpful, friendly and attentive - I couldn't as for more.   I'll be back to try some of the other menu items. I'll definitely refer this establishment to others.

There was a time when I went to this shop 2-3 times a week to write. The coffee is good, the people (and staff) are better, and the atmosphere is comfortable.   After not visiting It's a Grind for about 6 months I returned there a few days ago. The problem I had, the one that caused me to stop frequenting this shop to write, STILL exists - its Internet connectivity stinks. At this coffee shop you CANNOT stream video or music, you cannot instant messenger, and it takes 15-30 seconds to pull up a web page (this includes the dictionary.com or any link off a Google search query). Sadly, crappy WIFI is very annoying, counter-productive, and does not compensate for decent coffee, good atmosphere and good staff. Aside from times when I'm in the area I likely will not go back.

Bad store. Absolutely awful drive through. I live not too far from this location and have come to it for food over the years. Each time, over quite some time, I've been horribly disappointed by the drive-up service - today was no exception.  The food is McD's, what more need be said except that this time the burger tasted old and the fries were stale. Its one thing to wait 15 minutes when there are only two cars ahead of you and another to get crappy food once you finally get to the window.   I've been here enough times to say with confidence: Avoid this place.

My daughter and I happened to be in Metro around lunch and decided to pickup a snack. We were offered samples of their sandwiches - all were good. We ordered cheddar-bacon fries and lemonade. Everything we tasted was surprisingly good for a food court store.

I took my family to this establishment to see the local alternative band  The Love Me Not's who were to hit the state at 9 pm. We arrived at 8:15. The place, small indoor seating and large outdoor seating, was packed to the point where we couldn't find a seat outside. We went inside to order some food and wait until 9. Inside, it took 10 minutes before we were approached and given a menu. Drinks came quickly (iced tea, lemonade, and water) and we placed an order for nacho's when they arrived (8:30). By 8:55 the waiter approached offering us chips and salsa as we waited. I explained that we were there to see the 9 o'clock band and that we'd be outside shortly. A second waitress approached, the one who was supposed to be our server all along, asking if we needed anything. Being 9 PM I canceled the order and offered to pay for the drinks. She gave us the drinks for free. We went outside. The place was still packed and while we couldn't hear the announcement of the next band very well, we didn't hear them say anything similar to the Love Me Not's. Disgusted with the experience we left. We ended up at Old Chicago on Bell and had nacho's.  The issues with this place are piss-poor management and a total lack of organization. I blame the kitchen for being slow (possibly understaffed).  We didn't see or hear the band we came for, we didn't get the food we ordered.  I will not be coming back here again.

Good coffee, great staff, good wifi and a warm friendly atmosphere. I frequent this establishment to write 2-3 times a week for about a month now and have yet to be disappointed. Each drink is made for you when you order it (aka your drink may take a minute or two longer but its fresh every time! - I highly recommend their espresso Americano!). . Having mentioned recently publishing my first book, the staff invited me to use their facility for a book signing (if my book wasn't an eBook I would have jumped at the offer). Nice folks, super friendly, fresh flavor-filled coffee - a bit tricky to find the first time, but once you find it you won't be disappointed.

Great place to meet or get some work done (I'm a writer). Across from a college this place was designed with ample seating (with tables and outlets), reliable and fast free wifi connectivity, and a diverse coffee bar. In the evenings they bring in musical acts and, I believe on wednesdays, host an open mic night (comedy and music). Friendly staff, good coffee (and beer/wine) good regulars, and great wifi speed. As started in the beginning its a great place to meet or get some work done. I can't recommend this place highly enough.

It pains me to say that Next Coffee Company has closed. Good cofffee, good people, and a wonderfully diverse atmosphere (including live music and comedy in the evenings) was no match for this crappy economy. Sad days.

I'm sitting here as I write this.I'm thoroughly unimpressed.   With its bare white walls and sparse attempts at decor, this place is overly and unreasonably obnoxious. Despite not being crowded, and there never being more than one person in front of me each time, I had to wait on line.  With two people working behind the counter there's no reason to forget my order or make me wait 5+ minutes each time I needed something (to get my coffee, to ask for the Internet password, and then to remind them that I ordered coffee). Unfortunately the coffee supplied was  mediocre as best. Disruptive music selection that was too damn loud. Annoying..thank God for pandora.com, a good set of ear-bud, and reasonable wi-fi or I never would have gotten any work done.  The only reason I'd come back here is if my son had another concert to attend nearby. Needless to say, I do not recommend.

Good food, friendly staff. I would give it more stars except the gyro meat was on the dry side (my guess it was on the spit too long) and a bit more cucumber sause could have helped.  Great french fries! tasty baklava.  Coming from back east, its not the best greek food I've eaten but for Arizona not bad at all.

I've been here twice in the last week since my son's band practices nearby and I need a free wifi coffee place to write while I wait. I'm usually not big on DD but I have to say their coffee was very good (regular coffee with a shot of mocha) and can't be beat with one of their donuts. To make things better they provide free refills on drinks during the same visit. I had no issues with customer server (they came to my table and asked if I wanted a refill) and found the place relatively comfortable for my purposes. Since my son's band is within a mile I'll have no hesitation going back to this DD again.

I never liked fondue - that is until it was done correctly, The Melting Pot is definitely done correctly. This establishment is an eating experience. You do not get quality food, great service, and a unique fine dining experience without  spending a fair amount of cash. The Melting Pot is well worth the money spent.

Excellent display of music from around the world. In my opinion, this is the best museum that I've been to in Arizona.  If you go plan to spend a day. Musical instruments are represented from every country in the world. Through the use of headsets you can listen to close-proximity wifi explaining many of the instruments OR giving examples of them in use. Even if you aren't that into music (I am not) you can still be amazed by the fine artistry and ingenuity of people from just about anywhere as they seek to make a pleasing noise.   Best museum, kind of out-of-place,  in Phoenix.

Recently, I found myself in downtown Mesa looking for a place to sit an write a while while my son went to a concert - I had 4-5 hours to kill. I planned visiting one of the coffee houses within a 5 mile radius but my lack of familiarity with Mesa made that a disagreeable prospect. Fortunately, I noticed Lo-Fi Coffee, which was literally part of the concert venue building, before I began my trek. Lo-Fi was a comfortable place that served good coffee. But what made me a fan of Lo-Fi was the barista, an Air force vet who was friendly and went out of his way to make me comfortable (they closed at 9 and he let me sit in  until 9:30 - concert lasted until midnight). If I lived closer, or if Lo-Fi opened shop nearer where i live, I would go back again.

On-time. Knowledgeable.  Considerate. Courteous. We've used many carpet cleaning companies over the years, Sweettouch  blows them away AND sets a high standard. Very professional quality service.  Robert and Matt placed wall guards to prevent marks from their hoses and when they were ready to leave they left shoe covers so we could walk on the carpet if we needed to.  Exceptional services. Highly recommended. We will call them again.

I'm seldom in the East Valley. That said, I needed to drop someone at the airport in Mesa. I figured since I was in Mesa I would meet with some of my readers to sign some books. I couldn't find the coffee house I initially intended to sign at, even with a Mapquest map. Instead I came across this establishment.   Being an author, I spend quite a bit of time in quite a few coffee shops around the valley. My default brew at any new new place I try is the Americano bold roast.  Without exaggeration, Bold Roost is one of the more obnoxious coffee houses I've ever been to (including Starbucks, which I detest). First, the Americano was luke warm, overly bitter (even with 3 sugars and cream), and tasted as if it was made with tap water. Second, the service was absent, the two young women were more interested in talking to each other than following up. Lastly and most importantly (to me), the MUSIC was obnoxiously loud and poorly selected. When I arrived I was greeted with club music - pounding bass with screaming or chanting. Since I needed to stay a while I ended up listening to reggae. I can appreciate almost any genre of music for an hour or two. But the bass and chanting and the consistently loud, inescapable volume of the "music" was too obnoxious to allow me to concentrate on writing. If I wasn't meeting people I would have left after ten minutes.  I'm sticking it out until my readers get here. After that I hope never to see this place again. Not recommended.

I've been occasionally going to Native New Yorker establishments since I moved to Phoenix. We decided to try this place, with the name Native, last night. I ordered a Bronx Calzone, my wife ordered a Apple walnut salad and for an appetizer we had the chicken bacon ranch flat bread.   Bronx Calzone - overpowering tomato  flavor. I couldn't taste the peperoni at all. Apple Walnut Salad - they forgot the apples. Flat bread - tasty.  The service was good (Brian). The aesthetics of the place had a slapped together feel, very unlike other Native New Yorker restaurants I've visited. Of the 15-20 televisions only 1 had the coyotes game on, one had the suns game on, and the rest were a mix of golf, car racing, fishing, and boxing - all blaring loud. The noise in what was essentially a  giant room with tables was unsettling.  I cannot recommend going here because I can't see myself going back in the future.

This is a great place to see a concert. I went with my son to see Rival Sons last  night and the atmosphere worked perfectly to enhance the experience. The is plenty of standing room in front of the stage, tabled seating off to the left and the right, and raised VIP seating just behind the tabled seating. A full bar ran across the back wall.   We will definitely be keeping an eye on and heading back  to the Pressroom. A great time at a great location!

Because my son takes classes here I come here fairly often to write. The coffee itself is passable, nothing bad by any means but there are better. What makes Grounds for Thought stand out, to me, are the people behind the counter. The staff is friendly and they go out of their way to make you feel welcome - even if it is a huge, uncozy and sometimes ridiculously loud room. If you are on the GCC campus it worth stopping in.

Good food. My only knock is that the spice seem disproportionate. I think when seasoning is placed its not even spread across the item. Good food. To me, tediously annoying music (it could have been just what happened to come on).

There is absolutely nothing wrong or not delicious at this recently opened establishment. I've tried several items off their menu (pastries, cookies, sandwiches) and sampled their range of coffee in the short time they've been open and found everything delicious. Friendly customer centric staff, an immaculate atmosphere thats warm and inviting. I couldn't be more pleased to locate such a great place, fairly close to home, to write my novels. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

The best tasting and most unique frozen yogurt flavors I've ever had. The staff, everyone from the owner to the cashier, has been friendly and helpful on each of the three occasions I've visited. Menchie's is a self-service frozen yogurt store with no less than a dozen flavors of yogurt and an wide range of toppings.  I personally recommend trying the green apple frozen yogurt with hot-fudge and crushed nut topping.

I've been here many times. I hope the experience I had today does not reflect the long term condition of the store. While everything looked clean and inviting there was a horrid stench coming from the back that was absolutely repulsive. Myself and two other couples moved outside to get away from the smell. Each time to door was opened the stink would follow. I had to toss the yogurt and leave.  I'd go back again because of the long history I have with this establishment BUT if this happens again I call the board of health. Disgusting.
