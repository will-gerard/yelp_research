One of my favorite places in the Valley! My ex-boyfriend and I used to come here for lunch and dinner all the time! Great memories! The atmosphere is casual but intimate and cozy.   The aguas frescas are delish! I usually get sandia (watermelon) so yummy! Guacamole and salsas are to die for but what really keeps me coming back are the Enmoladas, Enchiladas Verdes and the Cecina and Milanesa Tortas! So amazing!!  Try the sangria - they put an incredible amount of fresh lime juice at the bottom of the glass! I absolutely love it!!

My dog JC has been going to Villa la Paws since 2010 and she loves it! Daycare, slumber parties and grooming - they do it all!   JC frequently gets groomed at Villa la Paws - they are absolutely the best! I won't take JC anywhere else.  JC has celebrated her last 3 birthdays at Villa la Paws. The staff are just so incredible! They are patient, fun, loving, kind and yet firm when they need to be. They make such a big deal when JC comes in that I just always leave feeling so confident that she is in the best hands!   Best part? Especially if you're worried about leaving your fur kid for several days? They have live cams! Yep, all you have to do is go on the website or, wait for it, there's an app for it! I frequently check on JC using my iPhone or iPad app - it's so awesome!  Thank you Villa la Paws!

I found The Art of Touch through my friend Lisa who happens to work there - well what a find! The space is in downtown Phoenix and incredibly charming with a very zen and cool funky vibe! Christine, Lisa and Tracy are absolutely the best professional masseuses in the Valley! I've been lucky to have several massages from each and they are so attentive and thorough - an incredible treat every single time! I cannot say enough good things about this place! Highly recommend! Take advantage of the Yelp and Living Social deals!

I love this place! My co worker and I eat here at least two times per week! Love everything I've ever tried. My favorite is the Chicken Boti.

Visited this place the evening of Sunday, December 22nd. We arrived a little after 9pm. My friend and I sat at the bar excited to have a couple drinks and enjoy what seemed to be a really fabulous ambiance. We sat down, took off our coats, got comfy and got ready to order drinks. It was at this point the bartender said they were closed. We looked around and the guys next to us at the bar had shiny new and full pints. We told the bartender that it was only 9:05pm and all he said was sorry and shrugged his shoulders. Not sure what we did to piss him off (if we did) but sheesh that was shitty! Plan to tell everyone I know and I'll make sure to never go there again. May not even go to Food Truck Fridays anymore either...
