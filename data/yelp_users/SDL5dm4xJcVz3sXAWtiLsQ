I wish i could give higher rating. Not comparable to buffalo exchange in alb. Nm. The women there usually are very sparse in choosey with the clothes. I have brought true religion jeans they turned down. 200 + jeans in perfect condition. I say go to other stores that buy sell trade. They might offer more. They did for me. $$$

great place to eat healthy Asian good. Not greasy or processed. I've have the noodle bowl with tons of veggies and the mu shu burrito with chicken. One of my favorite places to eat!

went to buy some couches cash... wouldn't even give 10 percent when it was a 4th of July special written on the wall. No deals and wouldn't budge on a couch that was a little cheaper at American Furniture. Spend ur money elsewhere better deals... looks like a flee market too.

By far one of the best. The plates are huge and the service was fast. I will be going back. Hopefully soon!

Nice stuff... run down .. tvs outdated and the 1200 ft suite wasn't as clean as it needed to be. Not happy with room and contacted the front desk multiple times for various issues with the room. They have some decent prices on rooms but now i know why.

Huge warehouse like bar and grill with strange Djs that play country along with hip hop and rap tracks to throw everyone off. The funny thing is that most people are dancing to the twerk songs rather than the 2 step! Its an average bar with average food and average girls.

Always watch football, ufc, or boxing games. Big TV's and the food is decent! Always a winner when I choose this place!
