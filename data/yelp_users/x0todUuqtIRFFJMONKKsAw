I have taken my dog here for the last couple years and I can't speak highly enough for the team of hard working folks at Malinda's. Every time I pick up my dog after her appointment she looks fantastic and is very happy. Finding a quality groomer is no easy task, but rest easy knowing that if you go to Malinda's your loved one is good hands!

Went to CPK again tonight. It had been awhile since my last visit in late 2010. The place looked the same, had more or less the same menu, and thought it would be business as usual.   We started off with some of their "small cravings" ... a little menu showcasing new smaller sides to share or enjoy before a meal. The Korean Beef Tacos looked interesting so we gave them a shot. Lets just say the only thing we were craving was our four dollars back after ordering them. Sure, cover anything in enough sauce it will taste okay. However, after eating a lot of tacos the past two weeks (been on the road traveling through CA), my money would have been better spent at Filli-anything or even Del Taco.   The main course was average, but it felt very commercially produced. No real flavor or excitement, just food.   Sorry CPK, but I won't be back anytime soon as my money is better spent elsewhere - especially with all the options available at Tempe Marketplace.

Have always had a great experience at this location. The customer service is always fantastic and the coffee tastes great. Wish there was more to write about, but it's just a great place to visit when at Tempe Marketpalce.
