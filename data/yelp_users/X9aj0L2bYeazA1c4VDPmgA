While working in the area I decided I would give Franks NY Deli a try. Pulling up I had to double check the address as Franks is located in a small neighborhood market.   The food is not deserving of the ratings here on Yelp as it is lower end processed meats and the menu is very limited with maybe 10 sandwich options.  I got the NY combo which is simply salami, ham, and choice of cheese. The sandwich is on a 10" roll and you get the basic toppings of lettuce, tomato, onion, and dressings.  The sandwich and a 16.9oz beverage was $6.45 which is a fair price for what you get.

This is a great little sandwich shop which serves fresh bread, quality meats, fat sliced french fries, and the best frozen drink out there.   The Eegee drink is really the best thing out there. It is pretty hard to describe exactly what sets this frozen fruit slush apart from the rest but it is literally unmatched. It is a perfect consistency of air, flavored ice, and real pieces of fruit. The regular flavors are Lemon, Strawberry, and Pina Colada and a four flavor varies by the month as a flavor of the month. My son has decided he wants this instead of a birthday cake for his upcoming birthday.

Great food and great service. I have never been disappointed at any of the 5 locations.  The pizza sauce takes a little getting use to and to be honest I was not a fan at first. After the third time though I acquired a taste for it. The freshness of all the other ingredients and the great customer service just put this local chain over the top.  The new Ahwatukee location took the place of Chili's on the NE corner of 48th St. and Chandler Blvd. This location has an extended menu from its four sister locations including additional appetizers, salads, and sandwiches. Spinatos take on a calzone is light (having significantly less bread than most calzones) fresh, and you can make any pizza or sandwich into a calzone. No gooey undercooked bread here. The crust is always thin and light but not to the point of feeling you are eating a cracker. The Brownie Bella Grande is simply amazing. I am not even a dessert guy but the warm brownie squares, gelato ice cream, and chocolate sauce is just too good to resist.   This is one of those local restaurants that just gets it. Great food, great prices, and great service.

In Vegas for the weekend and looking for off the strip eats. This little restaurant is located off Lake Mead Pkwy and Water in Henderson, NV.  Decor is small town cafe tables and chairs with lots of metal tin signs hung on the walls. The food does not disappoint with generous portions at a great price. I opted for the French toast with bacon and over easy eggs while my son had a breakfast burrito with chili. We enjoyed both dishes and neither of us could finish the portion size. Recommended for those looking for a small local restaurant when in Vegas.

Mucho Macho Taco - so the Macho comes from using 5" tortillas instead of 3" for their street tacos. Personally I think they should have spent more time making food with Mucho flavor instead of worrying about tortilla sizes. Mucho lacking here at Mucho Macho Taco. I went for lunch and after looking at the menu went with the brisket burrito, with green chillies, carmelized  onions and oranges.... Uh no oranges please. The green chillies were not New Mexico Hatch green chillies but instead food distributor canned green chillies. Carmelized onions, diced and slightly cooked does not equal carmelized. While the brisket was decent I am quite doubtful it was slow cooked out back for 10 hours- most likely off the Shamrock or Sysco truck as well.  While there is a salsa bar at Mucho Macho I did not care for any of the salsa options. The "hot" salsa which kind of looks like roasted salsa is nothing more than red pepper flakes and oil. Funny, I never use oil when making salsa. The mild was simply blended canned tomatoes and lacked flavor, the green which I am guessing was supposed to be an avocado whipped salsa had decent texture but also lacked flavor. There was no pico salsa available - WTH??  So in closing, the location is clean, simple decor, and the guys are nice but I will not be going back here at anytime as it significantly falls short of hundreds of other Mexican restaurants in the valley.
