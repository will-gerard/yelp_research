Honestly this location is the only Chipotle I have ever received poor service at.  When they put sour cream in my burrito after me not asking for it due to the allergic reaction eating it would cause, they were very rude about me saying I did not want it.  When I asked to speak to a manager they were even less helpful and pretty much told me my service did not matter to them.  This one poor experience was enough to make me never return to any Chipotle location again.

I had sent an email to laser for less after receiving a treatment that I was less then satisfied with. I have never been so impressed with the response I received, not only did the marketing director explain that they have a 14 day "touch up" policy (which I was unaware of), but she offered to do a complete re-laser of my chest and stomach area to rectify the issue, even though it had been well over a month since my last treatment. This is something I felt was clearly above and beyond for any business to do. Laser for less has made a lifetime customer out of me!

El hefe not only has some of the best food around, but it is the only place in Tempe to party when there are games, going out, or during the day!

I don't know who these people are but they're doing it right! I got a table there with one of their host named Folabi.( I know weird name right) but this  guy gave me by far the best customer service I have every had at any club. Polite, well dressed, helpful, he really showed me and all my friends a great experience. Introduced me to all the staff and hosted us the whole night.   Overall a beautiful venue, great music, great service and a fun time. You gotta check this place out. I heard they're doing a San Diego location as well. I can't wait thanks for having me CAKE...I'll be back soon.   Thanks  Miller

I can't say I have ever actually been to Zipps and received service I was even remotely content with.  This trend of poor service seems to apply to all locations of this sports grill and gives me no reason to go back.  I went with a few friends to the Mill location and all of them ordered the same order except for my order which was the only different of the four.  After an excess amount of wait time after ordering (a common occurrence at Zipps) the waitress returned with my three friends meals but not mine.    After waiting another 10 -15 minutes she finally returned and when I asked where my meal was she was confused and did not have it.  So she took my order again, with attitude, and my meal wasn't brought to me until about 10 minutes after everyone I was with had already finished theirs.  When I saw a manager approaching me with the food I was expecting some type of compensation or at least an apology, however I got almost the exact opposite.    The manager attempted to swing their mistake into blaming me for not having my food, which does not even make much sense.    So after poor service, immature management who can not hold themselves accountable for mistakes, and decent (at best) food, I will not be returning to any Zipps location again.
