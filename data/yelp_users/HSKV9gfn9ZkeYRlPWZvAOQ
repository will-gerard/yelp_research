Ohhhh Postino how I love you! I have been to Postino about 10 times and why now am I finally reviewing it...because today was my first lunch experience! And the best part about it, the patio is dog friendly! So me and my 4 legged companion sat outside and enjoyed the beautiful AZ spring weather.  I also enjoyed my Italian Picnic salad and Halo (my wonderful Belgian Malinois puppy) enjoyed a deep bowl of water with ice cubes!   The service is always friendly.  The food is always amazing.  They have great specials. What else do you need to read, I advise you to stop what you are doing (but finish reading my review) then head over to Postino.  I will tell you to go with no intention of being in and out because I have yet to dine with out a wait.  Get yourself a glass of wine and chill out.

I never thought I'd be giving my go to sushi joint 2 stars, but alas I am.  It's sad but true, over the past year I've watched Sakana slip. I'm not sure what happened to the little neighborhood sushi place that was once "authentic".  Last night was the last straw.  Like always I ordered a house salad that at one time was chalk full of tomatoes, fresh sliced mushrooms and a delightful ginger dressing.  This was not the case last night.  There was ONE sliced tomato and no mushrooms . The gingery dressing that I once loved has now been converted into the salty, orange mess.  I tried to eat it but after I felt the taste buds in my mouth disintegrating from sodium overload, I stopped.   Next came the sushi.  We ordered 3 different rolls; soft shell crab, Tootsie, and a spicy tuna.  They were all wrapped so loose that it made it next to impossible to eat with chopsticks.  I hate when I see people eating sushi with their hands, but last night I was one of those people.  I tasted one of the spicy tuna rolls and decided it was best not eat another one.  It tasted....fishy.....and anyone sushi eater knows that when fish tastes fishy, its bad news.  On a good note, the server was very nice. She took spicy tuna off the bill since we had only consumed one. She also offered free dessert but we declined and left.  I hate to say it but I will probably not return.   Oh, and did I mention we also had the pleasure of listening to Justin Bieber while we dined.  If I wanted to hang around sake bombing 19 year olds I would have gone to RA. Sorry Sakana.

Om nom nom....butternut squash ravioli!!! Yes please, I'll take 2! Not only is the pasta cooked to perfection but the tomato cream sauce is a perfect compliment to the sweetness of the ravioli filling. Darius (the sweet, charming, knowledgeable owner) made me feel like family during my time at La Torretta.  He even offered to pair wine with each course which made me feel like I was at a 5 star 5 diamond restaurant.    After spending 2 months in Italy and eating as much food as one person possibly could, I know good Italian food.  When I feel a pain in my gut for Spaghetti Bolognese, I now find comfort knowing La Torretta is right down the street waiting to give me my fix!

In my opinion, Fez does not live up to these 4 and 5 star reviews.   High Points of our experience: -Really tasty dirty martini -Cool lighting  -Interesting mix of patrons  Low points: -Bug in my water (EWWWWW) -Slow rude service -Expensive for what you get!!  I ordered the Fex Kirsa (sp??) it was better than decent but I wish our rudish waiter would have warned me that the sauce is a tad spicy. I like the manchago cheese shaved on top though.  I'm not saying I will not return to Fez if a group of friends was going, but I am definitely in no hurry to return.

The Corner chopped salad blows my mind every time I eat.  The flavors of smoked turkey, grapes, sweet pecans and blue cheese swirl around my taste buds and makes my mouth so happy! Also very tasty iced coffee.  Another great place to sit outside with my pooch.

The worse part about the Sofitel was having to leave.  I miss the bed.  I miss the robe and the towels and the L'occitane products in the bath room. I miss the quite gym. And the amazing city views from my room on the 7th story.   Every detail of my 5 night stay was fabulous.  From the housekeeping to the concierge service.  The location couldn't have been better! The Peel metro stop is just steps away from the hotel.  Also, if you like to walk/run Mont Royal is just up the street (at Peel and Pins).  Our last night in the city we were too tired to go to dinner so we sat at Le Bar and enjoyed a flight of French Reds and a cheese plate with 3 different local cheeses.  Although it was slightly pricey, listening to Joe-Luis speak about the wine and food with his sexy French Canadian accent made it all well worth it :)

OMG....I mean OMD!!!! I know most of these reviews refer to small, pretty, get dressed up in princess clothes dogs but I am here to tell you it's so much more!! Halo, my darling Malinios is 65 lbs of hiking, camping, playing in the dirt, barking at the mailman, etc. NOT primp and never let her feet touch the ground, as some pups are. (I'm not bashing those dogs either, its just not my lifestyle :) Needless to say, I always manage to find a plethora of goodies. Plus, Jacki (the fabulous owner) will special order anything you need. I came across bison bully sticks on a trip to CO, after looking everywhere for them, I finally asked Jac and about 7 days later, Halo was once again chewing her beloved bison bullies.   If you have a couple extra bucks and choose to spend them on your pup, I'm telling you...spend them here!! Your dog will thank you.

Where to start? It's rare for me to ever award 1 star but Marcella's is truly deserving. We walked into an empty welcome, were then guided to our table by a hostess who scolded for almost sitting at the wrong empty table. It only gets worse from here.  After waiting about 7 minutes to be greeted we finally ordered a salad with dressing on the side.  After another 15 or so minutes our salad that was drenched in dressing was brought to the table (no pepper offered).  We then placed our entree order.  We each ordered a different pasta and were equally disappointed in the not only the presentation but also the flavor.  To continue with the trend of food taking way to long to arrive our entrees came out 40 minutes after it was placed.  If it was busy, I would understand that it takes time for a decent kitchen to produce quality food.  Since we were 1 of 4 tables in the giant dining room, there was no excuse. When my pasta "make your own penne tossed with garlic oil, add sausage, peppers and onions (which came out raw!!!)and a dollop of ricotta" finally made its appearance, it was cold. I let the server (Tyler who may need a lesson in customer service) know my pasta was cold.  He stood there speechless until the awkward silence was over. I said I would eat it the way it was because I was close to eating my arm off after waiting almost an hour for my dinner. My dining companion was equally as unsatisfied but I will not go into detail. Then the bill came, not once but TWICE Tyler said, "Can I interest you in dessert this afternoon?" It was 9pm.  Thanks Tyler.  Just to add in a couple extras for your reading pleasure: *Water glasses are tiny and refill service is slow, so if you're thirsty, bring your own water! *Male was served before female in every course. *No manager came over after complaining about dressing on salad and cold pasta.   Overall, probably one of the worst experiences I've ever had dining out.

Having a high drive, highly intelligent, super cute dog is not always easy. But with Brice's help, both Halo and I are on the road success.    I've tried a couple other dog trainers in the valley but I have finally found my guy! He not only works on your dogs behavior but also focuses on the relationship between human and pooch.  She is learning my body language and in turn, I don't have to correct her as much.   Check out the website: www.totaldog.com for pricing packages. I am doing the unlimited because having an 8 month old Malinois...I need it!  I'll stay current on our training status but so far, I couldn't be more pleased!

Let me start off by saying DOG FRIENDLY!! Allow me to follow that statement with really good glass of Malbec for 5 bucks....and it wasn't even happy hour!! Hooray! I can afford to drink again!  Let the good times roll!  However, I am not awarding 5th and wine with 5 stars because they stole the bruschetta board idea from Postino AND it is not nearly as good. What they lack in brushetta they make up for in service. We had the pleasure of having Chris as our server.  Not only did he put up with 4 girls and 2 dogs, he did it with a smile and a great attitude. He was hot too, that always helps.   So thank you 5th and Wine for a lovely evening, looking forward to our next encounter.
