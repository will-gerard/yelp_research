If you're coming for a new or replacement social security card you need to go to Suite B NOT the main office. When you pull into the parking lot turn left and follow the road around. Suite B is located in the back left side of the building. The security guard will search your belonings so leave your guns and drugs at home. The staff was very friendly and I was in and out in about 45 minutes. If your changing your name like I was you will have to wait 48 hours before you to go to the MVD to get an updated licence to allow their system to process the change. I was told I'll receive my new card in the mail in 2 weeks.

Brigett's is a biker bar yet welcomes people from all walks of life.  I hadn't been in a while but stopped in last night with my mom to have dinner and play trivia.  Their menu has changed slightly and definitely for the better!  I had the fish tacos and they were fantastic.  They were topped with a tasty spicy mayo and fresh veggies as well as homemade guac on the side. 2 for $6.  My mom had french toast and eggs (they serve breakfast all day) and I just had to sneak a bite because the FT smelled so good!  They have several Mexican inspired dishes on their menu as well as burgers, sandwiches and salads.  We arrived too late to take advantage of their fantastic happy hour (drinks starting at $2!) but will definitely be back for it!  For those who enjoy Karaoke, they have it most (if not all?) nights of the week starting at 9:30 or so.  They also have plenty of televisions, 2 pool tables and video games (I believe I saw Goldentee) a horseshoe bar with about 20 stools and about 15 hightop tables that are easily pushed together to accomodate larger groups.

Came in on a Wednesday just after 11am so we just missed their breakfast specials. Our meals were very large and priced well. I had a combo plate with pancakes, eggs and sausage. I ordered a bagel with cream cheese on the side as well.  The pancakes were very large and fluffy and my eggs were poached PERFECTLY!  The bagel was very fresh tasting... not sure if they make them there but I would be surprised if they didn't!  Did have to take one star away because my husband did not enjoy his Eggs Benedict.  The hollandaise sauce was quite bland and not a true hollandaise sauce at all. Other than that we really enjoyed our server, she was very friendly and never let our coffee cups go empty.  We will be back!

I come here all the time and always receive speedy, efficient service.  I usually opt for the bakers dozen bucket which comes with two tubs of cream cheese for $14.25. They have several different flavors  of cream cheese to choose from. (Onion/chive, garlic herb, garden veg, salmon, honeyn etc) as well as a plethora of bagel varieties to choose from. I always get some of their fresh squeezed oj as well.   If coffee is more your style they do a variety of specialty coffees (hot and cold) as well as a traditional serve yourself coffee station. They also have to-go coffee boxes (like a box of wine but coffee) which is prefect if your hosting a meeting or its your turn to bring breakfast to the office!  They also serve breakfast sandwiches as well as lunch items.

Very extensive menu so good place to bring the family.  They specialize in wok style cooking so definitely check out that section of the menu. If you're not in the mood for that they have a large selection of salads (I love the Ahi Tuna Salad) and sandwiches. There is also a Build Your Own Burger (beef patty, chicken breast, gardenburger, salmon/mahi filet) option which is great. The kitchen is equipped with a wood fired grill so burgers/chicken/steaks etc have that great grilled flavor.  There are several specialty cocktails on the menu, like the habenero lime margarita and black cherry mojito...YUM! Staff is friendly and well versed on the menu. Would highly recommend checking this place out!

My husband and I went here to create our baby shower registery a few months back and were pleasantly suprised by how easy they make it for you. The woman at the desk was very friendly and helpful. This is our first child so we had no idea what we were doing! After being signed up, we were provided with a scanner, a map of the store and a checklist for must have items. The store is set up in lettered sections which makes it easy to find what you're looking for in such a large store. There is always a staff member around the corner that is eager to answer any questions you may have.  They also made it very easy to return things that we received, even without a receipt! They just loaded the value onto a gift card. Also, if you make your registry here... after your shower they will give you 15% off everything that is still on your registry!  They also have a great rewards program and you get coupons printed on your receipt every time you shop here! The reason I give 4 stars is because they are a little pricey...

William H is top notch. We have been coming here to see him for the past few years. Easy to make an appointment with and got us in and out in 30 minutes. Can't beat that. They have coffee and water in the front as well as a very friendly receptionist.

I love a joint with a good happy hour and this place delivers. $3 off ALL apps (including the samplers!) $4 wells, $2 off specially cocktails, $1 off drafts/wine. HH goes from 3-7 and 9-cl. We went with the burger/beer special tonight.  We were beyond satisfied with the HUGE bacon cheese burger with all the fix-ins PLUS a beer and fries for $6.95. Best burger I've had in a looooong time. But if your not in the mood for "bar food" they have some great dishes on the regular menu as well. The Jambalaya is so very tasty as is the shrimp soup with salmon. My husbands always gets the ribs. And always eats every last bite. For dessert you MUST try the Mud Pie. It's huge, so definitely share it. You won't be disappointed!

I absolutely love this place! I have been several times, always on a Tuesday to take advantage of their Taco Tuesday special. It's 3 tacos for $5 your choice of pork, fish or chicken (mix and match) My personal favorite is the fish.  They serve you your tacos in corn tortillas with cheese melted on top, then it's off to the taco bar! Yup, you get to dress up your own tacos however your heart desires.  The taco bar includes lettuce, cabbage, cilantro, diced tomatoes, green sauce and their baja sauce (delicious but very spicy!)  You can't beat this deal... especially when you pair them with some of their ICEY (and I mean ICEY!) cold beer, which is served by the glass or pitcher.  The last time we went my husband was not in the mood for tacos so he opted for their bison burger (added blue cheese crumbles and bacon) and it was delish!  Our server, Pam, was a delight.  She was very personable, very funny and made us feel at home.    There are plenty of televisions inside as well as a pool table. Seating includes booths, high tops and the bar top inside.  Outside on their full service, smoking patio (which is air conditioned!!!) there is a second bar as well as at least 10 more hightops.  I believe there are also 2 more TV's outside behind the bar.   And to those who feel the need to comment on the decor and refer to it as a dive, you need to hop in your car and head about 15 miles east. it's a place called Scottsdale... you can enjoy the company of your fellow douche bags there.

Called in a to go order the other night and was fairly impressed. Ashley took my order and was very friendly. We ordered the combination platter (which includes chicken parm, lasagna and fetticini alfredo) as well as the manacotti entree. Both came with your choice of soup or salad and garlic bread. We selected a Caesar salad and some kind of beef and vegetable soup. We were told it would be ready in 20 minutes.  Hubby went and picked up the food and described the inferior as a mom and pop kind of place. It was still piping hot when he returned home. Plus! The soup was hearty and flavorful, I highly recommend it. The manicotti was decent, a nice blend of ricotta and parmesan rolled into perfectly cooked noodles topped with their delicious marinara. The chicken parm was by far the beater. Very tender and breaded perfectly. Their lasagna was also quite tasty and I was suprised by the generous portion we recieved. The fetticini was tasty, their sauce tasted home made and had a nice flavor to it. The garlic bread was fresh, buttery and delicious. I would recommend ordering extra if you like to sop up your sauce as you eat.   I'll definitely be going back to try their pizza and will update this review when I do!

Open 24 hours a day. Very cheap and they have great breakfast specials. So be prepared to be surrounded by senior citizens!  It's a down home cooking kinda place where you get what you pay for. Staff is always welcoming and friendly. We've only been for breakfast and have always left full and happy.  My only complaint is that their coffee leaves something to be desired.

Very friendly staff and have some of the cheapest liquor prices in the area. Drive thru pharmacy is located around the back and is always quick. There are two red box machines located to the right of the entrance.  This location is not 24 hours and no longer sells tobacco, hence the 4 star review.

Been here a couple times and its been hit or miss. I usually have no problem, drive thru is pretty fast even during their busy hours. But the last time I went I ordered a combo meal at the drive thru and as I pulled away realized there were no fries in my bag. No biggie but when I went inside to get them, instead of just giving them to me, the girl at the counter called the drive thru girl over and asked her if I got my fries. Working in customer service for many years I found this to be very odd and demeaning in a way. Almost as if she was accusing me of lying without outright saying it. Over an order of french fries mind you. Well when the drive thru girl came over she looked me in the eyes and said "You know I gave you your fries" rolled her eyes and walked away before I could respond. The first girl I spoke to then proceeded to help the next person in line without speaking to me again. I honestly couldn't believe it. I mean really?  What kind of customer service is that?  When the cashier finished with the gentlman behind me she gave me an exasperated look of "what do you want?" Now I wasn't even mad when they forgot my fries, mistakes happen, but at this point I was reaching my boiling point. So I replied "Either you give me the fries I paid for or give me both your names and the number to your corporate office...you decide." I got yet another eye roll but finally received my fries!  Last time I go here though...too bad because it's the only location near my house.

One of the scarier gas station's I've been to in my day. Not in the best neighborhood and the clientele is evidence of this. Was harassed by not one but two homeless men as I walked in. While I usually wouldn't fault the store for this, these men where standing directly infront of the front doors in clear view of both employees and their manager and were not asked to leave. While waiting in line two men behind me got into a very loud verbal altercation which must be commonplace because the cashiers and manager didn't bat an eye. Yikes. The reason I give them 2 stars is due to the fact they're equipped with more gas pumps then your typical gas station and if that's all you need its betted than going across the street to AMPM and paying a 35 cent service fee for lesser quality gas.

FANTASTIC! Not just the food either. Service was impeccable. The bartender, Jo, took care of us at a booth in the bar during happy hour and was superb. Not only was she incredibly friendly her knowledge of their menu was impressive!  While we sat inside due to the heat they do have a fantastic patio that I'm sure fills up quick during the patio friendly time of year. Inside there is a bar area which includes a few booths as well as a large open area restaurant.   We shared their brisket quesadilla off of the HH menu. It was very large and quite tasty. Brisket was very tender. They make their own guacamole which is served along side the quesadillla along with salsa and a bbq sour cream.  I had the (award winning) Smokehouse burger and was not disappointed. It was very juicy and had great flavor to it. I'm not usually a fan of barbecue sauce on my burgers but this burger is definitely the exception! I chose the mac and cheese of my side and let me tell you, the best I've ever had! Don't tell my grandma I said that!  I'm talkin stick to your ribs good. I'm drooling right now just thinking about it.  They also give you fresh baked donuts in your way out as a thank you. Warm and delicious, I will definitely be back.

I have been to Wildfish on a number of occasions and have always left with a smile on my face.  The food is to die for.  We always sit in the bar and take advantage of their happy hour specials. Happy hour is 7 days a week, Sun-Thursday from 4pm to close and Friday and Saturday 4-7. They have several cocktails avaiable for $6 (including cosmos, bacardi mojitios, el jimador magaritas, etc.) If those don't strike your fancy you also receive $2 off any of their specialty cocktails. There is also a special on wine, but I dont drink wine so I'm not sure what the discount is.  There are several appetizers available for $1O and other "small plates" available at discounted prices. And you don't have to sit at the bar itself, there are several booths available as well as two long tables that would sit at least 8 probably 10 people so great for am after work spot with your co-workers.                                                                                       Last night by husband and I arrived right as they opened at 4 pm.  We sat down at the bar top and were immediately greeted by a friendly, young gent named Eric.  While we always have a great exerience at Wildfish, this visit was the by far the best solely due to Erics excetional service.  He was very accomadating and made is feel at home. The man also makes an amazing Manhattan and a sectacular Cucumber Martini.  Anywho, we ordered a dozen oysters ($2 each) and their kung pao calamari to start. Oysters were juicy and delicous and the calamari was a heaping portion of calamari tossed with veggies and toasted cashews in a delectable kung pao sauce over a bed of crispy rice noodles.                                                                                                    Next round, we ordered the piece de resistance.  Their Crabcake.  It is the reason we make the trek from Glendale at least once a month. Light, fluffy and full of big ole' pieces of delectable crab meat.  It's served with a side of remolade and is big enough to share as an appetizer or order for a meal.  It is truly the best crab cake I have ever had.  We always order it with a side of their truffled mac and cheese.  Weird combo I know, but it works!                                                              While we do not usually order dessert I can tell you that everything on that menu is made in their pastry kitchen daily.  Two that stuck out where the "bananas foster" butter cake and the Godiva chocolate cake, both baked to order. They also do espresso and lattes.

Love this place. We've dined in several times for lunch/dinner and have also ordered takeout many, many times. Great selection of hot dishes (our go to is always the daeji bulgogi) appetizers and a wide variety of sushi offerings. Our faves include the sonoran roll, mango pop and the gangster. They have a decent sake (hot and cold) and beer selection. They also have happy hour specials that run all day during the week.  If you dine in during lunch, take advantage of their amazing lunch specials. Two people can easily share a combo (choice of meat with sides and a 6 piece roll) and walk away happy. Also, the majority of tables have a grill in the center so you have the option of grilling your own meat if you'd like. Always fun for a date night or with a group of friends! They have a full bar (about 10 stools) and a sushi bar (both with televisions) and can accommodate large parties. Staff has always been friendly and helpful in explaining the menu (much of which is in korean).  Best thing about this place is they are open late. Real late. 1 am M-Th 2am Fri and Sat and 11 pm on Sunday. Need a late night fix? This is the spot. And again, get the daeji bulgogi. You will not be disappointed.

Right down the street from my house so I always go and pick up my pizza. Pizza is always ready when they say it will be,  piping hot. Cashiers are always upbeat and friendly.  Right now Mon-Thursday you can get a large 3 topping for $7.99. I used to hate Domino's but since they have changed their recipes I have become a fan. Their pan pizza is my go to for pizza style. They also do a decent Brooklyn style pizza, but being from NY/NJ there's no comparison to the real thing!

This is "My Fry's". It's less than a mile from my house and I have been here many, many times. Store is well kept and stocked and has very friendly employees, ones that will walk you halfway across the store to help you find a specific product and are happy to do so. Best part about this location is that when you walk in, there's a computer on your right where you can preorder your deli meats and cheeses. I always use this, get whatever else I need and then my order is waiting for me in a basket at the deli counter. No waiting in line for this lady! Also, Rose, the deli manager, is fantastic and all about customer service. I was looking for a specific cheese, they didn't have it so she special ordered it. I was eating it the next day. Love me some Rose.

Not the nicest Ross I've been to but has a fairly decent selection (far better then what you'll find at the location that is a few miles west, off Peoria). Fitting rooms actually have doors and not the blue curtains that most Ross' s utilize, so that's a real plus especially when your shopping with a toddler. I know the other mom's (and dad's! ) hear me on that one!   Anywho, the staff I encountered was very friendly and kept the store organized. Garments were where they should be (ie size) for the most part and easy to sort through. The shoe department was organized to perfection, which is a rare occurrence at any Ross. But the selection in my size was rather sparse, hence the 4 stars. Overall, this locations selection focuses more on women but there's plenty of clothes for the men and children as well.

The woman who runs the deli, Rose, is fantastic. Went in looking for a specific type of cheese and when I couldn't find it I asked for her help. She told me that they usually only carry it during the holidays but she would be happy to order it for me. Came back the next day and there it was! Talk about customer service!

Ask for Savannah. Outstanding service. And try the buffalo chicken dip. It's fantastic! Good place to watch ufc fights...no cover.  Great drinks specials during fights and games. Smoking is allowed on the patio where they have about ten tables and three tvs. Inside their are tables, high tops and a large bar with every seat in the place having a great view of one of their many big screens ( including two projector screens)

My husband and I have been here several times and have always been pleased with the quality of our meals.  It's hard to find fresh seafood in Phoenix and this place has delivered time and again. We always go during their happy hour which is from 3-6 M-F in their bar area which includes seats at the HUGE bar top and a few booths.  Not sure if HH is available on the patio... Compared to their normal menu prices ($$$) their HH pricing is fantastic.  And if you have a hankering for oysters this is the place to go.  Last time we went we got a dozen  of delicious Gulf Coast oysters for $7.95. They have several other HH food items in the $4-$7 price range ( calamari, catfish poboys, steamed cajun shrimp served with sausage and corn on the cob) but our favorite by far is the alligator.  They typically serve it fried but on our first visit our server recommended trying it blackened. We went with her suggestion and were not disappointed. It is served with a rich, brown sauces that is is on it's own fantastic. The drink prices on their HH are decent as well.  I usually go with their specialty cocktail "The Swampthing" It's a deceptively strong, frozen drink that I highly suggest. Get the large, it comes in an icy goblet that will keep your drink nice and cold as you enjoy your meal. They also have a good draft beer selection if that is more your thing.  The bill between the two of us is usually around $50 for a few  apps, a couple drinks a piece and a dozen oysters. They will also provide you with some fresh baked bread.  The regular menu is rather large and features a variety of seafood.  You have quite the selection to choose from including alaskan king crab legs, live maine lobster  and all sorts of fish.  I think I saw a scallop dish or two on there as well.  They also have several "combination" platters that feature fried shrimp, fish, stuffed shrimp, stuffed crab, etc. My husband once ordered a cajun tilapia (mahi perhaps?) with scallops dish that he loved off their "Specialty Menu". I can suggest the live lobster as well.  On one visit I saw the lobster tank and couldn't help myself. They actually had an 8 lb lobster in there! He proudly carried the title "KIng of the Tank" He was $159 and probably would have been worth every cent but I opted for one of the smaller guys.  I was not disappointed.  Mr Delicious was served with drawn butter and a side of pasta (linguine with diablo sauce I believe) and I have actually gone back and ordered just the side of pasta it was so good!   The restaurant itself is rather large but it is always busy so get there early or at least call ahead.  Especially if you have a larger group.

After moving to this side of town I have finally found my new salon!  Got the "Happy Feet" pedicure and am very pleased.  $40 got me the usual accoutrements of a pedicure plus extra foot and leg massage, hot rock massage and a paraffin wax treatment for my feet.  While the wax was drying I was surprised by a neck and shoulder massage!  Loved every minute of it!   I came in around noon on a Friday ( without an appointment) and was sat down in one of their 14 massage chair immediately. Appears they are fully staffed today with at least 12 techs on.  Very clean inside as well.  I'm so glad to have found this salon.

Right next to the movie theatre so convenient to grab a bite before or after. I wanted to try the pizza because of their wood burning oven. Unfortunately I was told as soon as I walked in the door that no pizza being served that day. I found this odd due to the fact it was Saturday and more than half of their menu is pizza. I decided to try their Caprese sandwich.  It was decent but not worth $12. My server seemed less than enthusiastic to be there and did not make me feel very welcome. Didn't even say thank you or goodbye even though I walked right past him as I was leaving. They do however appear to have a rather extensive coffee and dessert menu that I will be going back to check out. I was just so turned off by the poor service I had to get out of

The service was fantastic as was the food. Their corn beef hash is homemade... delicious. Pancakes are light fluffy and huge! I also recommend the biscuits and gravy. Stick to your ribs good. Get there between 6:00 and 10:30am for breakfast

This Sarbucks is right next to my work so I am here 3-4 times a week (at least!) One thing I really like is their large patio equipped with a misting system.  The majority of the tables are under the roof awning so it's a great place to relax with your coffee and utilize their free WiFi or go old school and read the paper. If your lucky you might even see one of their regulars; a gentleman who sits outside with his toucan on his shoulder! Scared the bejesus out of me first time I walked past him... Inside the baristas are friendly and efficient and have no problem making custom offers. They also regularly have samples of new drinks and/or food items out for customers to sample. There is also adequate seating inside if you can't deal with the heat!

I love this place. Far better than Subway or Quiznos. While they have a set menu with more than 20 subs you are welcome to build your own as well. They offer 3 sizes of subs (nug 4", pinned 8" and  blunt 12") on white, wheat or garlic "herb" bread. All subs are served with lettuce, onions, tomatoes, pickles and their special sauce. They also serve salads and have a variety of desserts.  They offer several vegetarian options, my personal fave is the majic mushroom with teriyaki marinated portabella mushrooms with green bell peppers, pineapple and pepperjack cheese. I always add honeymustard which was recommended by the cashier on our first visit. In the mood for some meat?  The Dank (a pizza sub) or The Kind (Turkey, swiss, bacon and mushriom) are great too!  And guess what!? They serve Kool-Aid. Ohhhhh Yeeaaahhh!

Can be pricey if you go all out but I went for HH and paid $25 for a cheese pot, a salad, a glass of wine and dessert. Not too shabby. The bartender was very friendly and knew his stuff! Portions were large and I left very satisfied and will definitly be back.

DONT BOTHER! TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!  Never again. Very pushy attendants who try and sell you things you don't want and then act offended when you say no.  Paid $120 to have my car detailed and was less than impressed with the results. My carpets were still dirty...windows were too...and they didn't even attempt to wipe down my center console. And they had my car for 4 HOURS! It's a two door Toyota Solara...what the hell were you doing for 4 hours? When I pointed these things out I was basically told too bad so sad. They didn't care at all. Asked to speak to a manager and was told he went home for the day and to call back tomorrow.

Found some amazing deals on Christmas gifts for our 2 1/2 year old son.  Their toy section has some real bargains. I scored a Batman scooter, a "Cars" bat and ball set, a large plastic tool bench with attached chalkboard (equipped with all sorts of plastic tools) and a 5 foot basketball hoop for $60.   They also have a wide assortment of woman's, children's and men's clothing as well as an extensive "home" section. Think curtains, bedsets, pots and pans, artwork etc. There are deals to be had in all areas of the store, you just have to look for them.   My one complaint is that you are unable to take your shopping cart out of the store. When purchasing 3 large boxed items that makes for a difficult transition from store to car, especially when you have a toddler with you. Next time I go I'll be sure to bring my husband to help carry all the sweet deals out to the car.

If I could this place no stars I would.  Slowest drive thru ever. Literally took 20 minutes to order. Then I was told to pull up and wait some more after I paid. They actually have designated spots for you to wait in which tells me they know how slow they are! This is not what I call fast food. NEVER AGAIN.  Next time I will just drive down the street to BK or Wendy's.

You walk in and are greeted by a selection of over 300 bootled sodas (they also have a fountain with pepsi products and SLUSH PUPPIES!) I got the California burger rocket style which comes with three patties on a 12 inch sub roll.  It was fantastic! Plenty of bacon and cheese and they definitely didn't skimp on the avocado!  The bread was freshly baked and fluffy. I also ordered onion rings.  Perfect amount of cornmeal breading, very crispy and not greasy at all. While they specialize in burgers they also serve salads, subs, gyros etc. Great place to stop in for a quick bite. You'll also receivea discount if you check in on YELP :-)

Came on a Saturday night around 7 and were sat immediately. It is a smaller place with a bar capable of seating 15 or so and about 15 tables.   I'm not sure if it's a nightly occurrence but there was a gentleman playing on their piano and a young lady singing. It provided a nice ambiance.  The menu consists of apps, salads, a few pastas, traditional entrees and pizza. We had the stuffed mushrooms as an app and weren't too impressed. They weren't terrible, just nothing special. The entrees were a different story. My husband's mushroom lasagna was to die for.  Great flavor, perfectly cooked noodles with just the right amount of each ingredient. I had the veal parm and it hit the spot.Veal was tender and had just the right amount of breading. Their marinara is homemade and fantastic. I could've eaten it with a spoon all on its own. The portion was quite generous and was accompanied by spaghetti and marinara. Our only compliant was that they do not offer draft beers and their bottled beer selection was very limited.  While many traditional Italian dishes are not listed on the menu our server informed us that items like marsalas and piccatas are available upon request.

I come here every Thursday with my family for Team Trivia (they also have trivia on Saturday) and the staff makes us feel at home.  Our favorite server is Gina, she is very friendly and always accomadating.  Their menu is very impressive for a sports bar.  They have numeruous specialty burgers (which can be served on their fantastic pretzel bun!) as well as an extensive selection of sandwiches. My favorite burger is their pesto turkey burger, it has great flavor and the basil mayo is delicious! They also have several items not normally found in a sports bar like their grilled salmon dinner or fish and chips.  I've also had fajitas there when they were on special and they were quite tasty.  The layout of the bar features a misted, fenced in patio with tables and hightops where you can smoke while enjoying your cocktails and food. Inside there is a host station to your left or you can just seat yourself at the bar or at one of the 12 or so hightops surronding it. To the left of the bar is the "restaurant" area if you will. It's seperated by a partition wall and two large screen tvs. There are about 10 tables in this section as well as a larger table tucked in the back that could comfortably hold 8 people. There are tvs galore in this  place. All of them high definition and large screen. There really isn't a bad seat in the house when it comes to watching a sporting event. One of my favorite things about this place is that they have a couch set up in back infront of two of their televisions, if you get here early enough during football season snag it! It's like sitting in your living room watching the games yet someone is serving you cold beers and delicious food. The only time you have to get up is too pee. Legit.  I have never attended but I hear they have bingo nights as well as poker tournaments here. There are also dartboards as well as a golden tee machine. Free wifi as well, just ask your server for the password.

Went in today to sign up for internet/Wi-Fi service and was in and out in less than 15 minutes. Was greeted immediately as I walked in by a gentleman named Allie.  He was courteous, friendly and knowledgeable. I told him what I needed and he got it done. They will be here tomorrow morning to install everything and then I won't have to do these reviews on my phone anymore. Hooray! Any who, I would suggest going mid afternoon during the week to avoid long waits.  However, there are a couple couches and tv's to watch while you wait so that's a bonus.

Moved to this side of town so I decided to try a new place out that's closer to my new place. Smaller than I expected but was pleasantly surprised to be sat down immediately. It was a Wednesday around 1 o'clock so I wouldn't expect this during busier times. They have 6 pedicure chairs and 8 manicure stations. The gentleman who did my nails was friendly and efficient. I went in for a backfill and was in and out in less than and hour. Was charged $35 not including tip.  My only complaint is that their TV wasn't on and I got a little bored just staring at a wall for almost an hour.  I would have just used my phone to occupy my time but for some reason he kept having me put the hand he wasn't working on under the blacklight on the station. Not just at the end... the whole time which I found odd.  I did notice that a woman receiving a pedicure was treated to a hot paraffin wax which I found out is included in the pedicure package. Will be going back to try that out for sure!

Went in with my husband on a Tuesday around 7 after a long day of shopping and we were famished. It had been 115 that day and we were quite parched as well. We seat ourselves at a booth in the bar area and wait to be greeted. A young lady walks up a few minutes later and drops menus and walks off without saying a word. Okay....strike one. Well after I watch her take an order at another table and input it in the computer she finally heads back to our table and says "Ready?" No hello, no how's it going, no introduction. Don't get me wrong, I get that this isn't Fleming's but give me a break. My husband asks her what kind of beers they have on draft and the girl literally points to the taps and says "they're right there" as she  rolls her eyes. Wow...strike 2. He reluctantly orders a blue moon and I order an iced tea and tell her we need more time to decide on food.  Minutes go by...no drinks. We watch her walk about the restaurant checking on other tables, put another order in, sip on her drink in the server station...etc. We have now been here for 15 minutes and have received nothing.    Yes...Finally! She's coming back to our table! But wait...She is empty handed! Nooooo! I'm so thirsty!!! "The bartender is changing the blue moon keg so it'll be a minute" she says and then turns around and walks away. Now I've been a bartender/server for 15 years. When bar drinks are going to take a minute I bring the non alcoholic bevs out along with a water for the guest who ordered the bar drink. I also know it doesn't take 15 minutes to change a keg...not to mention we can see the bartender still behind the bar talking to her bar guests. We wait another 5 minutes...the bartender is still talking to her bar guest and our server is on her phone in the server station and it's now been 20 minutes and we don't even have water. Strike 3, we're out. Neither the bartender or our server acknowledge us as we stand up and walk out never to return. It's a shame because we recently moved to the area and are looking for a new place to spend our Sundays during football season. This will not be it.

Great weekend breakfast items/deals. Build your own Bloody Mary bar on Sundays.  Regular menu is american with a Mexican influence. Ask for tommy or Christina. There's also off track betting.  Horses and dogs.

My husband and I just walked out without bothering to order anything.  We sat down at a half booth half table in the bar next to a large party and were greeted by a young man named Aaron.  He immediately told us the table was reserved as the party next to us had more people coming...thats funny I didn't know you could reserve tables in a bar during HH.  So here I am 9 months pregnant told to get up and move to an uncomfortable high top.  My husband mentions that if a table is reserved it should have signs on it so people don't sit down and have to move.  Instead of saying Im sorry or I'll let a manager know Aaron decides to get snappy and tell us we should just get there earlier next time. Thanks Aaron, we'll keep that in mind when we go anywhere but this Buffalo Wild Wings location.  As we got up to leave he sarcastically said goodbye and proceeded to be argumentative with my husband when he told him that his customer service skills were seriously lacking. Its a shame because we live right down the street and used to come here 2-3 times a month.

Hands down best food I've had in a long, long time. It's an Asain Mexican fusion inspired menu which features some amazing food. My best friend and I do dinner at least once a month and are always trying out new spots.  We have uniformly christened this as the official mac daddy. Here's why...  Ambiance is fantastic. When all the sliding glass doors are open the whole restaurant is patio like. With the A/C  running full blast you never feel the wretched AZ heat, yet it's like your dining al fresco. They even have a very large tree (albeit fake) inside the restaurant. Aside from at least 15 4-top tables (which I'm sure can be slid together to accommodate large parties) I saw inside, there are also few half booth half tables. Not to mention they have a large patio with booths, tables and high tops.  There's not only a sushi bar to sit at but also a "kitchen bar" which surrounds the open kitchen. Pretty cool. We sat a the bar ( which is rather large, and features 2 large projection television screens ) to take advantage of happy hour. Their bar stools cushioned seats with backs (plus!)  On to the food/drinks...  Their drink menu consists of 15 or so specialty cocktails. (All $2 off on happy hour) Some martinis, some frozen, some on the rocks. All have interesting ingredients that you wont find in many places. I tried the "Coconut" and the "Kumquat". Both were fantastic. They also have a lengthy sake menu. Aside from several specialty beers on draft they have "Patron" on draught. Ice cold tequila shots that aren't watered down? Yes please! They have a decent wine list as well.   To eat we ordered several things to share. First round was the bacon wrapped dates and wild mushroom tacos. Both were stellar. The bacon wrapped around the dates was cooked to perfection. The chorizo and queso fresco filling was warm,creamy and paired perfectly with the sweetness of the dates. It was honestly one of the best dishes I've ever had. The tacos weren't close behind in flavor and will be ordered again. (FYI during happy hour you can 4 of ANY of their tacos and a 32oz beer for $14)  Second round was the braised pork belly, coconut mussels and the mango habenero salmon ceviche. The pork belly was demolished almost instantaneously because well it's pork belly and who doesn't like pork belly!? The mussels were served in a delicious coconut, lime and ginger broth. They were the biggest mussels I have ever seen and tasted very fresh. Melted in my mouth. I just wish they were served with something to sop up the glorious nectar the mussels were served in! The salmon ceviche was decent, I wish there was more of a kick to it. Just needed something but that's probably just me. The salmon itself was very fresh though I must say.   For dessert we opted for the trio of creme brule. Kumquat, chocolate raspberry and green tea were being served that night. The green tea was my favorite. Perfect way to end a delicious meal.   Finally, our bartender Katelyn was great. She helped guide us through the menu and recommended several of the items we ordered and she was spot on! We will be back to see her!
