I love this place but wow. Service couldn't be more disorganized. I was told two hr wait for table. Took 50 min. Then I get table and nearly 40 min later no food still. Manager looks lost. It's freezing on here. Turn the ac off please. Bar tried to charge me for things I didn't order. Tables are sitting empty and unclean with people waiting in line to sit. ?  No direction. A rudderless ship.   Hope the food makes the last 90 min of sitting and waiting worth it   Hmmmmmmmm wait wait wait.

Many issues here. It took nearly 20 min to just get a drink. Then the 2nd drink took just as long and we informed we had plans in an hour before sitting down. Small things so far... But it gets worse  They charged me for drinks I didn't order. They spilled beer on my dinner.   When I informed them of the over charge They ran my card twice!!!   As we got up they spilled catchup all over my wife's back and hair and on my expensive cowboy boots.   When we told manager he said there is nothing he could do to make us leave happy.   He gave us a business card and said come visit again when he isn't busy :/   It's an hour drive each way for us :(  Don't do it. To many other nearby choices.

My last visit... I was in a hurry so I took the drive through. I ordered a large latte n breakfast wrap. I was asked to pull through and they would bring it out despite small order. I watched the next 7 people leave with their orders. Finally some one came outside with my order then went back in.   After another minute they came out again looking lost. I honked. The girl was nice and I asked what is the problem. She the new guy working the window doesn't know how to make wraps. Or apparently lattes I said. As my latte was a giant glass of milk. :(  I had no more time to wait.   Disappointing at best

I was going about a normal day when I noticed as I was getting ready for a crazy busy day at work that it felt real warm in the house.  It is AZ in August.  But then a few minutes later sitting still in front of a fan I was dying.  I had to go to work and I have dogs in the house.    I called Airspeed and expressed my concern and problem.  I didn't even finish texting my wife the situation and Toby from airspeed was here!!! less than 5 minutes.  He finished fixing the problem in 15 minutes and now my AC is blowing at 66 degrees!  Couldn't be happier with that level service and speed.  thx Airspeed.

My wife surprised me with tickets to the rocky horror picture show.   After she told me I read the reviews and was freaked out. Almost didn't go.   So so glad I did. I had the best time. From the moment I walked in security was funny and friendly.   Ac was on and it was a great temp in the event center the whole time.   Bathrooms were spotless.   Drinks were reasonable prices with friendly bartenders. I even met the manger who too was friendly and engaging.   Enjoyed every minute and don't understand the reviews on yelp.   Can't wait to go again :)

Just loved it. It was busy but there is a reason. 5 stars period. Got the Rueben burger and the apple Brie burger. Both amazing. Fresh made chips and the pretzel appetizer was fantastic!

Super friendly service with the nfl games through house pa sounds awesome. Got wings and a Philly cheesesteak with bloody Mary's and bloody beers. Service was on it. Nice open air environment in this great weather was appreciated.   Will definitely be back for more nfl football!!!  Was great portions.  And great prices.
