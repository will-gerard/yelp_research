I have been here twice. They didn't put espresso in my latte this time, and their food was gross both times... Not to mention all of the employees give off an elitist hippie/hipster vibe. Hate it.

This place was bomb.   The pork belly appetizer was super tender and delicious. I got The Nancy, which is a veggie sandwich with a shiz ton of brie on it, so you  know it was good. My favorite part of the meal may have been the tater tots... Such fancy and detectable tots stuffed with bacon and cheese and herbs. The service was awesome, too! The waiter had great suggestions. Some random bar tender yelled, "See you tomorrow!" when we left, which was pretty hilarious.   Okay, first Yelp review: complete.

I love this place! Everything is delish and the staff is really cool. Their pressed juices are bommmb. I also love all of their sandwiches in wrap form... And the breakfast is amazing. The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is the layout of the restaurant... It makes things feel a little hectic when it's busy. But yeah, go there NOW.

This is literally one of the worst experiences I've ever had at a restaurant. We had a reservation for a large group, but they had us down for the wrong day, and they had to scramble to fit us in... The customer service was horrible, the manager was a jerk, and the food wasn't even good. Several people even had their food prepared incorrectly, but didn't bother sending it back for fear it would take another year to have it fixed. I actually ended up leaving before my food even came out... I had been seated for nearly 2 hours at that point, and I felt like a beggar asking for bites of other peoples' entr√©es. Other people in the group had their food brought out 45 min before I left... I went home, heated up my own food, and ate it before my some of my friends got their food at the restaurant. So ridiculous!!!! Please don't eat here.
