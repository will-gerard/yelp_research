Love me some Mac and Gaydos! They are funny and deliver the news that we need. Ned and Connie in the mornings are great too! They have a fantastic dynamic together and help me smile while waking up (Not a fan of Monica who does the entertainment news but she's only on twice an hour quickly in the mornings.)

Service was good and provided wonderful recommendations. My wife and I were able to take all the time we needed to place our order then to eat. I didn't feel rushed out the door which made it a pleasant experience where we could relax have some good food and some drinks.

Large burgers that will be sure to stuff you! The outside and inside may appear a little dingy but don't let that steer you away. It wasn't the best burger I've ever had but it certainly was worth every penny I paid.

Chicago style pan is worth the 45 min wait to make!  Save room for the pizza cookie!

I love love love this place and take out of town visitors here when I have the chance. It's usually about $10 for a burger which is average amongst restaurants but the food is delicious!  The onion rings in the burger is a great touch too. Great place to eat and hang out!

Extremely poor management, the cashiers were very understaffed people were waiting in line for 15 to 20 minutes. There were cashiers leaving the checkout line to go check in the back of the store for a price of a wallet. They looked like they were lost and did not know what they were doing there was no manager in sight. I was very disappointed in the service and left my clothes there without purchasing as I will never shop there again.

Stuffed bacon cheeseburger with pretzel bun was great!! The atmosphere was good but it was a little warmer than what I feel is comfortable. Service was average. Overall, a good experience, will likely go back at some point.

Not a fan of this Starbucks. Baristas are rude and stingy. There comfy chairs at this one which is nice but doesn't make up for the less than satisfactory service.

I was here for a large party event where we rented out one of the buildings in back. The staff was very accommodating and friendly and making sure all amenities were continuously refreshed. I had steak and must say that it was the best steak that I have had in years! The environment is upbeat and fun, this is a place I feel is family-friendly and also could be a date night. Highly recommended!

I ordered just a regular old burger that was nothing special and quite frankly over priced. I wasn't too impressed with the live music they had playing. Also expected the atmosphere to be a little more fun and excited. Probably won't be back.

It's crammed on the inside and they don't have any comfortable chairs to sit in while there. Don't plan on spending any amount of time here with no place to hang out-chairs they have really hurt your back.

This place is ridiculous. I went inside and stood in line for 10 minutes watching the staff just screw around in the kitchen every 30 seconds looking over at me right in the eyes while they weren't doing anything. It was very frustrating as a customer, I walked out and I'll never walk back into this place again.

Oh my goodness...you want real BBQ?! This is your place. Any time the BBQ conversation starts, I ask if they've been to Rudy's because they are worth every bite. Half lean, half moist and some beans on the side baby and I'm ready to chow down.

Pretty good BBQ but the one thing you must get no matter what if you come here is the bacon board. The has at least 6 different types of bacon you can sample and every one of them is delicious. I wouldn't make the trip for the BBQ but just might for that bacon board again. Service was better than average.

We went to go see an IMAX movie and the quality was pretty good but the theater seems like it's pretty rundown. I went with two friends and all three of our seats were torn up pleather. They all had rips tears and snags in them. And the staff seemed friendly and we didn't experience any issues, I was just disappointed with the condition of the building.
