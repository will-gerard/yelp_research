I like to shop at Dillard's for shoes. Great selection and LOVE the prices when they have their sales.   I went in the other day to get a pair for my friend's wedding. She wants the bridesmaids in sparkly shoes. I have some from my own wedding, but they are TERRIBLY uncomfortable. To be honest, I rarely find a comfortable pair of heels and I was explaining this to  Mitch in the shoe department. I was telling him that I am a size 8, but usually end up buying my heels in 7.5 because, otherwise, my feet slip right out of them. I have tried shoe inserts and they help...a little bit...sometimes....but one of my feet is usually slipping out halfway through a night of wearing them.  Mitch offered to put some inserts in the heel I had picked. I explained that I had tried this before...I have even tried two inserts (one in the toe and one in the heel) with no luck. He suggested that it was all in the placement of the insert and he placed a Foot Petal towards the edge of the toe, where my big toe would be. It made a HUGE difference. I will admit that I also needed a heel insert.   I'll be giving these babies a test run pretty soon here and I'll let you know the result. But, regardless, I appreciated Mitch's attentiveness and his non-pushy approach to selling shoes.

Purchased a suit here 3 years ago and was very happy with it. However, I had a far less than stellar experience here just this weekend. Long story short: they didn't have the top I wanted in the right color and size, but offered to have it shipped to me for no additional charge. Great, right? WRONG. What an ordeal. Sounds like a great option in terms of customer service but turned out to be a huge pain in the ass. Not so sure about this place anymore.

I drove 15 miles out of my way to check this place out based on the recommendations of my mom and yelpers.  Staff was very friendly. When I pulled up a guy told me to pull my car into the oil change bay after my car wash so they could fill up one of my tires since it looked low and check the other ones (what service!! of course I took them up on it). Another guy offered to repair a tiny chip in my windshield, which I declined, and he did not pressure me to change my mind...appreciated. They offered to shampoo my mats for an additional, but reasonable, charge and they came out looking great! They were very thorough when vacuuming the interior. Car looked wonderful when they were finished...best car wash I've had in a long time. What a nice place to wait too. Large convenience store, Dunkin Donuts, televisions and comfy seating inside, padded patio furniture shaded by umbrellas outside. Pretty fancy if you ask me. I'm definitely going back.

If you are looking for friendly service, opt for the location on Guadalupe and McClintock instead. My visit here today reminded me why I typically drive a little bit further in order to avoid this location. Checkout girl didn't even bother to push my bagged groceries towards the end of the belt so I could easily load them into the cart. And the girl at the bagging station walked away right as the cashier finished ringing everything up. As I was loading my cart the disinterested cashier says one word, "eggs" and hands me my final bag. Just kind of a pathetic experience.

The salsa here is so flavorful.   I say order a burrito or anything that comes with red or green chili. Neither is too spicy, both are delicious.  -Gollo Burro: flour tortilla filled with green chili, whole pinto beans, onions, cheese topped, melted butter. I usually order it without butter just to spare the extra calories and it's just as delicious.  -Charro Completo: flour tortilla filled with red chili, green chili, refried beans, onions and cheese.   -bean and cheese burrito enchilada style, yum!!  Everyone here is friendly. Four stars because sometimes the service is a little bit on the slower side. But the food makes it worth the wait!

This place is by my mom's house and sometimes we'll stop here for a pedicure. We have been here a number of times and always leave happy.   Clean and updated facilities, comfortable chairs. Everyone is very friendly and professional. The wait (if any) is always minimal. Good selection of colors. Reasonable prices. And, one of my favorite parts, they don't try to upsell you with some lengthy menu (flowers, sugar scrub, callous removal, etc.)...they just give you what you ask for. They may make an occasional recommendation but I have been some places where I feel like I'm being harassed to get more services and I have never felt like that here.   Although I typically get pedicures here, my mom did treat me to a gel manicure a few weeks ago and I was very happy with it. It lasted about 2 weeks with no chipping until I couldn't take the growth anymore and removed it myself--so, it may have lasted even longer. They recently got OPI gel colors here and I was very happy with all of the color choices

As an Arizona native, it's rare that I get to experience many of the resorts here in town. I had looked forward to staying here for some time and then the right occasion presented itself.   The room was fine, but I wouldn't rave about it. Definitely not what I expected for the price. Room was cozy, and the beds were comfortable. However, the room smelled old and musty. Not the kind of smell that gives a room character, but the kind of smell that almost makes you want to spend $40 on a candle in the gift shop just to make it go away. We enjoyed having a nice TV, small fridge, and dock for our ipod. The bathroom and dressing area had everything that we needed, but the dark wood left me wanting more light and these areas just really need an update.   We headed to the pool, but could not find any unused towels. We tracked down a waiter and asked him where we could get towels. He advised to look around the pool area, but there probably weren't any left and proceeded to provide us with a lengthy and defensive explanation. All we asked was where we could find a towel. No more, no less. We finally found a spot to sit (a spot without shade, but a place to sit nonetheless) and tracked down a server so we could order some refreshing cocktails. Not the greatest cocktails but they were tasty.  That evening we met with some friend at R bar for cocktails and appetizers. Great atmosphere, delicious cocktails and appetizers. After that the plan was to get a cab to take us to dinner on central and camelback. A hotel employee told us that the hotel had a town car service that would take us to our destination and it would cost far less than a Taxi. The Valet confirmed this information. We told him where we were going and he said it would be about $15. WRONG!! We got to the restaurant and the driver charged us $34. Talk about a disappointment. Sounds like a severe breakdown in communication.  I might be interested in giving the resort a second try someday, but not until they make some improvements.

I have been eating at Cibo for about 5 years now and had not been to Pizzeria Bianco until yesterday. I have been dying to participate in the Cibo vs Bianco challenge but the long wait at Bianco rarely fit into my schedule. That is, until my friend and I were able to stop in for lunch on a weekday when there was no wait...  The verdict? CIBO WINS!  Better menu, much bigger selection of pizzas, salads, and antipasti. Better prices (Bianco's pizzas are either $13 or $16, Cibo has many more choices ranging from $10.50 to $16.50 but most of their option avg. $14). Cibo offers a fantastic variety of pizza toppings.  The food at Cibo has never let me down. I have tried a number of things on the menu and it makes ordering very difficult these days because EVERYTHING IS DELICIOUS!! But, if I had to create an All-Star Meal it would be as follows:  Pesto Salad (or Pear Salad; dammit, this is already tough) Antipasto Speciale (meat, cheese, olives, roasted peppers...and I remember these balsamic onions that I can't get enough of) Salsiccia (the BEST sausage pizza) Nutella and banana crepe (enough said)  This meal would feed 3 people, EASY!! My husband and I typically order two pizzas and a salad and still have a couple of pieces to take home.  I should also mention that we got married at Cibo almost two years ago. The food and service was impeccable that day (as always). Prepare to be impressed.

A little on the pricey side for BBQ, but the food and ambiance here are great. Looks a little more upscale on the inside than what I had expected...reminds me of something somewhere between Charleston's and the Keg. This is a pleasant surprise, especially considering the location.  The portions are huge, definitely big enough to share (which helps with the cost) and there are probably going to be leftovers depending on what you order. I have sampled most of the BBQ on the menu and it is all delicious. They bring a carafe of mild and regular sauces to the table so there is no shortage of sweet-tangy-saucy deliciousness. Good selection of side dishes. I especially liked their cole slaw -- not too wet, not too sweet.  The server brings a little bag of fresh mini donuts sprinkled with cinnamon sugar at the end of the meal. They are pretty incredible!!!

While I was in school I didn't really make the dentist a priority; because of time, money, and just wanting to avoid any dentist in general. Multiple friends had visited Dr. Metz and had good things to say so I decided to give him a try.    I have been seeing him for a year now and have been in the office maybe 8 times (avoiding the dentist was a bad idea). Dr. Metz and his staff are always incredibly friendly and eager to make me comfortable. Whenever I go in for work I am offered noise canceling headphones and a blanket (I always get cold so this is much appreciated). Everyone is wonderful about explaining exactly what they are going to do so there are no surprises. Dr. Metz also uses a camera to take before, during, and after photos so I can see exactly what he's seeing.    I needed a number of fillings and my first crown; the work was divided into multiple visits. I also had some old silver fillings that were making me very self conscious about my smile so the staff put together a treatment plan that would help me achieve the smile I wanted.   Before I got the crown, I called the office and told them I was concerned because I was going to be going to San Francisco a few days after getting my temporary on and was worried about being able to enjoy the food that the city had to offer (great food is always a priority on vacation). They moved my appointment up by a couple of days and had the lab rush my crown so I could have my permanent crown before leaving town. I appreciated them being so accommodating and was able to eat my way through SF without a problem. Now, Dr. Metz can make same day crowns in-office which is even better; my husband had one and was happy with the results.     I was eager to finish my necessary dental work so I could have my teeth whitened afterwards -- something I had wanted to do for a very long. The minute my last filling was finished I said that I was looking forward to whitening and Dr. Metz said, "Wanna do it now?" I had the day off and my answer was "YES!" I did the in-office Zoom whitening with a kit to take home for touch ups and now I'm proud to show off my brighter smile.    Dr. Metz ALWAYS calls me in the evening on the day of my dental work to check up on me, make sure I'm not having any problems, and he encourages me to call if I have any issues. I think I'm in good hands.    I also think they have a fantastic referral program and I have received a couple of Visa gift cards in the mail so far...a very nice surprise to find in the mailbox.   If I have one complaint it's that I wish they had longer, earlier, or later hours as the current hours seem to fall right in the middle of the work day. Other than that, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Vibrant Dentistry!!

ALWAYS trying to upsell me on a number of services...high pressure too. I usually point out something that needs special attention (dog hair in the back seat, crumbs on the floor, etc) and they consistently proceed to do a half ass vacuum job. Two stars because the outside of the car usually looks nice and the inside is wiped down pretty well.. Overall, however, these guys need to step up their game. I used to bring my car here when it was under previous ownership and was always pleased with the service. Now I would prefer to drive 10-15 miles further to get a superior car wash.

YUM!!! A friend recommended that I try Daily Dose because I LOVE breakfast! So I came here twice in one week. The wait on a Saturday morning was around 10 min and there was free hot coffee to enjoy while waiting which was greatly appreciated.  The menu has so many different options that all sound fantastic, hard to pick something.  The first time I went I got the crabcake omelet and it was pretty incredible. Big crab cakes, delicious omelet, tasty sides... The serving was huge (at a very reasonable price) and I had leftovers that heated up really well in a skillet the next day. I also got a mimosa that was heavy on the champagne, light on the OJ -- perfect!  The next time I went with my mom and we split the ginger snap granola, which came with fresh and sweet strawberries, and the prime rib omelet. Once again, I was impressed.   Can't wait to come back and try the cherry margarita that I spotted on the menu. I've been dreaming about it every since.

JACKPOT!  A friend had told us about The Parlor a few years ago. Apparently we have been quite the slackers. We finally stopped in two weeks ago and it was outstanding.  Ambiance: love it Service: attentive, friendly Food: great menu with plenty of enticing options Cocktails: superb  I ordered the Jalisco Sunrise. The perfect margarita with serrano infused tequila. Brilliant! Not too sweet. Spicy. Delicious.  Husband and I couldn't decide what to order AT ALL so we asked the server for recommendations and went with the Roasted Corn pizza and Parsnip Gnudi to share. The pizza crust was light and fluffy on the inside, just crisp enough on the outside. If I could describe the flavors in this particular pizza as both light and rich then I would. (I can do what I want? Light and rich it is!) Oddly, I felt the same about the gnudi. If you want to eat til you're stuffed, I would recommend either ordering one more thing or choosing a more hearty dish.   With plenty of room for dessert we asked the server to surprise us. He brought out the  Pasticcino: warm, flaky crust filled with fig compote (just sweet enough) and was accompanied by their dark cherry ice cream (rich, tart, and sweet). It kind of reminded me of a fancy toaster strudel. We enjoyed the dessert but would probably try something different next time.   We also ordered two cups of coffee to go with dessert. The coffee here is from Lux. It was brought to the table in a french press and it was terrific! A single french press (just $3) was plenty for the two of us...talk about a good deal.  The Parlor is great for a quiet dinner date or a night out with friends. I can't wait to come back here!

Love the selection, love the prices!! I agree with the others too--superior to BevMo.  One complaint: it seems that they are always out of Bell's Two Hearted Ale when my husband and I go in. Are they not ordering enough? Inadequate allocation by their distributor or the brewing company? Come on guys! I'd buy it if you had it in stock...

My husband and I went in for the first time two weeks ago to find liqueur that we had been looking for all over the valley.  Brian was knowledgeable, helpful, and friendly. He really knew his stuff. He explained why we weren't able to find this particular liqueur in the valley as they have been trying to obtain some themselves. We got to talking about some drinks that we were trying to perfect at home and he made some excellent recommendations. We felt as if we really hit the jackpot on this trip. Total Wine is great and all, but sometimes I feel like the employees there don't REALLY know what they're talking about.   Brian, will you be our real life friend? Goodness, I hope his name was Brian or else this review just got really embarrassing.

I will drive out of my way to go to this location anytime. There are 3 other locations at equal distance or closer and i would much rather go to this one. The staff is always very friendly and helpful. The store is very clean and keeps a nice appearance. There are a lot of families shopping at this location. Great selection, great prices (I think Frys prices are the most competitive among the larger chains in town).

FIVE STARS FOR ARTIE!!  The first time we called Artie was when we had a leak under our kitchen sink. I had turned to Yelp hoping I could find somebody with decent reviews. I was sold after all of his five star reviews and knew we had to try him out.  To date he has installed a new kitchen sink, replaced a kitchen faucet and a bathroom faucet, and snaked our drain after a backup in our laundry room and kitchen. You better believe he's the first person I'll call when my next plumbing nightmare arises and he's the first person I'll refer my friends and family to as well.  He is very professional, prompt, efficient, friendly, and reasonably priced! You really couldn't ask for more.

Happy Hour every day from 4-6:30! It can be tough to find a decent HH on the weekend.   My husband and I each ordered a house margarita ($4 each) -- they were just OK, a little sweet for my taste and so so tequila, but it's pretty hard to beat a $4 margy.   We also got:  -an order of chips and salsa ($2): DELICIOUS!  -steak tostadas ($3.50): 3 mini ones per order, easy on the steak, topped with what seemed like a salad tossed in a bit too much dressing   -shredded beef flautas ($3): 3 of them smothered in enchilada sauce, lettuce, and drizzled with sour cream. these were tasty but they weren't very warm  -canteen wings ($4): 6 chicken wings smothered in either buffalo or tamarind sauce (we got the buffalo, it was good) and served with some rubbery celery sticks  The food on the happy hour menu could use some improvements. I would consider the flautas again but would absolutely send them back next time if not heated properly. Pass on the tostadas. I would get the wings and the chips/salsa again. I would be interested to try the tamarind wing sauce next time; the server described it as sweet and spicy.   Overall, I can't really complain about so much food and a couple of margys for $20.   I should mention that I had been here once before to order from the regular menu. I split an order of the pork street tacos and an order of the mushroom street tacos with my husband. We thought both were terrific. Husband works nearby and periodically stops here with coworkers; he says the guacamole is also tasty.

Stopped here for lunch with my BFF today.  Nowhere to park, forced to valet, meh...  Love the atmosphere here: classy decor, beautiful patio. Everything on the menu looked delicious. I had a hard time choosing between many foods that I love: crab cakes, goat cheese, crepes... I wanted something lighter so I ordered the oriental chicken salad. In the meantime, our drinks were brought to the table. BFF pulled the spoon out of her iced tea to find that there was some leftover peanut butter still on it. The question is: who left it there? Don't know. Gross. This was pointed out to a server (not ours because she had not returned to our table). Our server brought out a new iced tea. She was polite, but not necessarily apologetic.   When our meal was delivered to the table, BFF pointed out that there were tomatoes on her sandwich (she asked for no tomatoes). The server said that the other server probably grabbed the wrong plate. She came back from the kitchen twice to tell us that the new sandwich would be right out. So, I sat with my salad and waited to eat until BFF got her meal (It took a good 5-10 minutes for her new sandwich to come out).   BFF raved about the dressing on her side salad. My salad was fine, but nothing to rave about (especially not for $13). The ingredients were fresh but the "shredded chicken" that was described on the menu appeared to be sliced chicken breast. To be honest, I prefer shredded chicken which is why I had decided on that particular salad. DISAPPOINTING.  The server arrived at the table to ask if we wanted to order dessert. We replied, "no, thank you". And she said something like, "oh, come on, are you sure?". Again, we declined but I really think she should have offered us free dessert after our bummer lunch.  The topper? 1 valet guy and 6 people in line to pick up their cars=a 10 minute wait just to leave the place.   I would hesitate to come back, but that menu is just so damn tempting.

Friendly staff, always eager to help. Great prices on Natural Balance (much cheaper than Petsmart or Petco). Frequent buyer program (this might only be for the type of food that I buy, not sure) so you get your 10th bag of food free (or maybe it's the 11th one you get for free?)...no time restrictions so I'm still working towards my free bag.

I had been excited to try Brat Haus and it didn't disappoint when my husband and I dropped in last night.  We sat at the bar in the Bru Haus and chatted with the bartender a bit. Their beer selection was amazing: craft brews - most of them on draft but some options in a can as well. They carried some of our favorites: Dogfish Head 90-minute IPA, Bells Two-Hearted, Dale's Pale Ale.  If I remember correctly, prices ranged from $5-8...not terrible and plenty of them were priced at the lower end of the range.They have a very short list of house cocktails (4 or 5) for the non-beer drinkers but I thought they sounded delicious and for a moment I was tempted to order a cocktail instead.  I ordered the Thai Brat with apricot onion chutney. I had been warned that it would be spicy since it contained sriracha but I like some heat so I ordered it anyway. The mix of sweet and spicy was nice, but I will admit that 3/4 of my way through it I had to hand the rest over to my husband -- too spicy. It was almost so spicy that I feared I was missing out on some really good flavors going on in there, but I still enjoyed it. He ordered the Spicy Brat with sauerkraut. The brat was not as spicy as the Thai brat but it was delicious. The bar was lined with ketchup, mustard, curry ketchup, honey mustard, whole grain mustard, and dijon mustard. My husband was happy because he used curry ketchup at home. I like regular ketchup so much that I normally don't use it but it was a nice addition to the Thai Brat.  Fries? A-MAZING! A small order was plenty to split but I could've eaten a large just because it's so hard to stop eating them. You are given a choice of about 8 dipping sauces. We had the bacon bleu-cheese, but all of the options sounded great so it was a tough choice.  We splurged and got dessert. We typically skip this last course, but I had to try the butterscotch root beer float. LOVED IT! Made with vanilla ice cream and Dang's Butterscotch Root Beer, very clever.   The service was great, the food was outstanding. There is something for everyone here. Can't wait to go back!

Stopped in last night to check it out since we were in the neighborhood. Loved everything (beers, food, atmosphere, service) and can't wait to come back with friends.   My husband and I generally prefer pale ales so we ordered the Single Pale Ale and American Pale Ale. Both were awesome! We had sampled some pale ales at Arizona Wilderness the night before and I preferred the beers at Fate. I would even say that Fate  could easily become my favorite local brew. Looking forward to coming back for the Double Oatmeal IPA.  Food was impressive as well and prices were very reasonable. Menu consists of pizzas, salads, and apps. It was hard to choose a pizza because they all sounded great, some interesting ingredient combos too. Our server recommended the fennel sausage and it didn't disappoint. The sausage had great flavor and loved the pairing with goat cheese!!

My new favorite place for a sandwich. Prices are extremely reasonable and food is great! Easy to order online and pick up -- we did this a couple times at work, everyone ordered and paid individually online.   I had food from here twice and both times I got the same thing because it was just that good: skinny beef, add mushrooms, peppers, mayo, lettuce, tomato, and pickles. The second time I added a cup of the broccoli cheese soup which was also great.  One of my coworkers got a shake -- I just wanted to eat the little cookie that they put on the straw.
