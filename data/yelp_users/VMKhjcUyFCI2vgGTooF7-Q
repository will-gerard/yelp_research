living in san francisco, it's really easy to be chain averse...  but when you're away from san francisco, i say, embrace the good stuff!  Houston's is one of the "good stuff". i'm not a huge meat eater, but i will never say no to their barbequed pork ribs. no gimmicks or frills, they deliver well-marinated, well-portioned, well-serviced ribs -- and other food for that matter. the ambiance is comfortable, and the service was super sweet with a cherry on top.   when you're away from home, it's nice to know what you'll be getting is that familiar friendly food.

8 things i love about you bandera:  1. your welcoming atmosphere - thank you for opening your kitchen doors to us - literally! walking through it made me feel like you had nothing to hide and everything to share!  2. your super friendly service - clean-cut uniforms with little sheriff like badges with your names on them, super smiley and attentive service, and just enough attention to keep our conversation flowing and our food & drink coming.  3. your easy parking - lots of street parking and a quiet lot with special places to put my car.   4. the way you fit right in - with matching yet modern decor to the old town scottsdale outside, you set the mood. i feel like biting straight into your famous flying chicken and ordering me an old-fashioned gimlet!   5. your love letter of a menu - with wooing words of homey sides and starters, and a well varied assortment of meat, fish, vegetables, and desserts, i was spoiled even before beginning my meal.   6. your cornbread - could i ask for anything warmer, sweeter, or comfier? with bites of jalapeno and delicious crunchy parts, you had me at corn--.  7. your banana cream pie - with real chunks of fruit (yes!), and a wonderful praline-like crust, you were lighter and healthier than i expected. all the more reason for me to want you more.  8. the way you make me wanting more - i need to see you again. i long to see you again. for those beef ribs. for that prime rib. for that barbequed salmon. and to revisit that grilled halibut and mexican cucumber salad. mMmmM.

it's a dose of mexican comfort food and hospitality.  i'm definitely not a mexican food connoisseur, but i definitely know fresh, tasty, and homemade food -- and this is where it's at!  conveniently located around the biltmore area, the restaurant is a pop of color on 24th street. you can't miss it!  for dinner, we didn't need reservations on a wednesday, and were greeted with warm, professional, and attentive service. the menu offers many traditional mexican plates of food (like the delish mole poblano i had), so don't be expecting any nachos, quesadillas, enchillada buffet (though i secretly wished they had some).  everything from the BYOB (with no corkage or additional charges), to the personal service, and the free-flow pour of aqua frescas (watermelon for me, yum!), was just so home-style and comfortable.   the food was no different - the guacamole, the tortillas, the mole sauce, and even dirty rice -- all tasted like it came from mama's kitchen.  there was enough depth of flavor for all dishes to be interesting, and enough simplicity to make it casual and easy to eat! (use your hands!) portions were just right, and coming from san francisco, all that food for under $50 was a steal!  definitely a go-to for the next biz trip to phx... gracias senorita!

Your first night in Vegas, traveling in a pack of 15, and only cover charges in sight, who do you call on?  SHADOW BAR!  It is hard (even for me) to not stare at the mesmerizing curves behind the white screen (are they real or fake? well, that one bounces, that one doesn't?). ONE STAR.   It is always nice when the first drink you order is on the house - in this case, many thanks to the bartender from Glendale who comped us those 15 house shots, and put on a WONDERFUL show doing it (see local photo). An hour's worth of fun a la zero cover and gratis drinks. Sweet! TWO STARS.  It is also fun to shake your booty to the Top 40 and popular hits that they spin, while claiming your space in the bar for you and your crowd. Swing hip left, swing hip right, swing hip left, swing hip right. Do it with me now. It is also a blast testing out who knows the most lyrics of those songs. DT - you totally win hands down. THREE STARS.   It is hilarious to watch boys-and-girls-who-really-shouldn't-be grinding each other, hugging each other, kissing each other *oh ick*, and going to the floor with it all. FOUR STARS - ONE STAR = THREE STARS.  It is just exciting to know that on a random Friday night, you are in Vegas, at Caesar's, in your party gear, with your bestest friends. On the town. FOUR STARS.  A good time to be had by all!

while it's 104 degrees outside, it is a comfortable 25 degrees in my mouth. *aaaaah*  Red Mango did just the trick for the heat of a Las Vegas summer. a giddy girlfriend and i ran to the sleek store front as the rest of our group ducked into the neighboring CVS pharmacy. (where would YOU go for comfort huh?)  the original yogurt itself is not too sweet and not too tart. in my opinion (and that of baby bear), it was *juuuuust riiiiight*! they offered the standard tastings of chocolate bars, fruit, and cereal (my personal pick - blueberry, pineapple, and fruity pebbles!!!), in the standard sizes, and served it up nice and cold.   a hearty serving of gourmet snow in my mouth, zapped with some fruity vitamins, and crunchy cereal - made for a happy, heureuse di! :) (along with the rest of the gang as they intruded with their spoons!)   be sure to stop by!

foodie-style dining in a safeway plaza?? only in phoenix.   it's no wonder that i left giddy as a school girl, in surprise!  Noca is SF-palate approved *stamp*. fresh ingredients put together beautifully on a plate, with inventive flavor combinations and pizzazz! the menu is seasonal and for the summer time, a cold refreshing corn soup or burrata and tomato salad hit the spot. both appetizer and entree portions were perfect. while prices may be a bit steep for phoenix standards, i would argue that they are well worth it.  service is attentive, friendly, and genuine. little touches like pouring soup in the bowl table-side, amuse bouches, and *surprise* cotton candy at meal's end just make for even more giggles of delight. the setting is clean, simple, with a slight hum in the air from the open kitchen.  a great option for a date, dinner with friends, and even a work trip! we'll be stopping by this plaza again for sure, for more reasons than safeway!

fresh, fruity, affordable, and deeee-lightful!  True Food Kitchen makes you believe that all other food might be - *gasp* - fake! this is seriously healthy food with flavor flare and creativity. not only that, but they truly exude the organic way of life with their considerate service and bouncy personalities to match.  Now don't go ordering something you wouldn't usually order just b/c you think it will be healthy. If you like fish, eat the fish, don't eat the steak tacos just b/c you think it'll be healthy - of course you will be less inclined to like it!   so far, i have had their soba noodles entree - it is a plentiful serving of cold green tea noodles tossed with peas, bok choy, and ginger. seriously good for you and excitingly tasty!  i have also had the tuna sliders, which come with no sides, so i suggest the sweet potato hash for something filling. the wasabi mayo, pickled onions, and avocado go deliciously well with the seared tuna patties.   last a-ha! tasteI had was trying the sustainable red wine from Arizona! Who woulda thunk that this glass would be so well-balanced -- and good for the earth too. Yay!  in a land where all i thought i could get was steak and deep fried tacos, True Food Kitchen is truly my home kitchen away from home!

the water slide and poolside cabanas teased me to come play.  the spa's subtle aroma of massage oil and massage beds peeking out from the outdoor treatment rooms wooed me to put my feet up.  the bustling lobby bar and shaded outdoor patio tried to sweet talk me into having a drink.  ... and all would have come to fruition if i didn't happen to be here for work.  nonetheless....  the front desk staff did very efficiently and warmly welcome me into my very comfortable room.  the historical and luxe charm of the resort did inspire me to take long walks at night around the property to ooh and ahh at their croquet field, life size chess board, and rolling golf course.  their room service very patiently waited for me every morning as i rushed out of the shower to greet my breakfast at the door and unveiled my morning goodies.  and the arizona sun feathered me out of bed every morning - orange, hot, and inviting - making me wish that i was here on vacation instead.

no preface, no disclaimers, and no tip-toeing here.  the truth of the matter is -- Zinburger needs to live up to their name a bit better. one would expect tasty, delicious burgers from a resto that has the word "burger" in it?  two out of four of our diners ordered red meat beef burgers - one was the kobe, and one was the zinburger. the kobe burger was not juicy, and the burger patty fell apart when cut. the zinburger actually seemed to do better, at least, by holding itself together! overall, the burgers lacked embellishment and that something special that i could not get from McD's (at least i might get a toy there?).  remarks for the ahi tuna sandwich included "not good, it gave me a tummy ache. they lied to me! they gave me lettuce instead of cole slaw"  feedback for the chicken sandwich was "pretty good, but spicy". that's probably why this diner had three beers to go along with it. hehe.  sweet potato fries vs. zucchini fries - sweet potato wins for being proper fries that do not fall apart (a recurring theme). zucchini fries dip wins though.  it's a great concept, which was what initially drew us into the resto, but execution? i might need a couple more bottles of Zin to swallow this one down!
