I arrive late on a Sunday night and was greeted by a tattered gentleman.  He was insanely nice and helpful BUT his tie looked like it was chewed off.  As a patron, regardless of dress code, I would prefer to see no tie at all.  I was first given a room that was completely filled with a stale smoke smell.  The gentleman was really apologetic and immediately gave me a new room.  Just bothers me that the patron is the one to identify this.  Doesn't cleaning staff report this?  They have two options for cleaning rooms: 1. complete service with change of sheets and towels or 2.  Absolutely nothing at all for a $5 voucher which they gave me once in the 4 days I qualified.  I would love to see an inbetween, else, what am I paying you for?  I had to fetch my own TP and coffee when you gave me enough for two days.  EVERYTHING was out of order.  I actually selected this location based on 3 things: 1. proximity to airport. 2. price 3. gym.  Their ONLY weight machine was out of order.  The ice machine was out of order.  The stairs were out of order.  The conference room was even out of order.   The price on the website that I paid was higher than the others because it included free, IN ROOM, HIGH SPEED internet access.  Not the case.  I couldn't even connect in my room.  I reported this twice and nothing was done.  One girl just said, "that stinks."    The options on the website make you think you are paying for something extra when it's items already included.    The breakfast is not a deal by booking in advance.  I booked in advance and had to go the next day and ask for my vouchers.  I ordered room service once and it never came.  The front desk refused to assist.  How to you have a restaurant IN a hotel and act like they are not even connected?  First day at breakfast was horrible. There was 1 person working and she just kept stating that this isn't her job.  No clean tables.  $5 or the voucher gets you cereal or oatmeal, giant oversized stale bread that didnt fit into the toaster and prepackaged pastries.  For an addition $5 or $10 there was a hot meal portion that varied daily.  Seemed good but already bitter about paying $5 for fruit loops that I didn't bother.  The only positive that I really have:  the bed is super comfy.

I've never been one for Mexican food but this place has changed my mind. Most items seemed to be small plate-esque so I ordered two small looking items to get variety: sopes and quesadillas.  The cashier went out of his way to explain that the quesadilla wasn't the typical quesadilla but through the pictures I had figured as much.  It was smaller than what we typically expect and it was fried...still cheese filled and amazing.  The sopes was a corn shell with beans lettuce and sour cream on it.  They had other varieties but went with vegetarian.  Both items were under $3 which makes for a cheap lunch.  They also offer soda pop in the old retro glass bottles which is kind of cool.  Now, why I almost take away a star.  A man walked in to apparently try and sell customers some items...meanwhile the cashier/maybe owner/manager locks the door.  Maybe I am just paranoid but it felt like they were trapping us in there.  There just seemed to be a lot of looks being shot around the room and it was freaking me out.    If I am in vegas again I would surely stop in but mayhaps take it to go. But seriously, amazing food!

Stayed here for a work trip..there was a convention in the hotel.  I was trying to claim my reservation and they gave me the wrong person and could clearly see by the price that we were not getting a good deal by any means.  Placed a credit card on file and they called the room a day later to tell me that my card was going to be charged nearly $300 when the room was pre-paid.    The rooms themselves were nice and large but everything was so spread out.  I had two other co-workers staying in the same hotel and they couldn't manage to get us all in the same building when each building had three floors and probably 20 rooms a floor or so.  Also went to the gym a couple of times.  It was empty most times and plenty of equipment to work with, all equipment seemed kept up.  Also looked like they offered other services (massage, etc.) if you went during regular hours...I generally went really early or pretty late.  Next, the internet.  $15 a day is way. too. much. way, way, way too much.  We supposedly got a special rate knowing we were there on business..a charge like this makes me feel nickel and dimed.  It's been awhile since I've been to Vegas but don't they have smoke-free casinos yet?  I don't want to be forced to smoke a pack just because I wanted to gamble...it's such stale air and in combination with the smoke it was pretty gross.  I don't know...not eager to go back and have stayed at nicer places that are more convenient and priced better.

It's hard to go to a restaurant that had no patrons in my week stay at the Sheraton where they are located.  I ordered breakfast one morning for room service and it never came.  I went one other night out of sheer boredom and had a glass of wine.  The bartenders were nice and attentive (because there were only two people in the entire restaurant).  Ordered some nachos since I had the $5 coupon for opting out of room service.  They were good but super huge.   Going with 2 stars due to the no service the one time...there just seemed to be no resolution for it other than being told "they were short-staffed."

Traveling with a coworker who lives more locally, I am super glad I fessed up to being a snob about eating at chain restaurants.  I turned down Subway and broke out my Yelp app!  Zookz was nearby and had good ratings so we checked it out.  What a different idea.  It reminds me of Uncrustables in the freezer section of the grocery store but with much more adult and better fillings.    I walked in and saw a picture of the #13 which is poached egg, feta, spinach, tomato.  I didn't even look any further..this looked amazing.  And it was!  I wish I could have tried more!  I do think my coworker could have eaten more but they did have some side options available.  The sandwich was less than $5, I believe.  All options appeared $7 and less.  They also have Coke products...I'm a sucker for a fountain diet Coke.  The service was really friendly with someone greeting us immediately, taking our order promptly, and even asking how our meal was and how we heard of Zookz!  My only desire is that they open one in Dallas or Plano, Texas!  (:

Checkin was super easy, since I had an out of state license I was able to use a kiosk and skip the line that had formed.  Once to the parking garage I was greeted with a cold water which was really appreciated. I was led to the car they intended me to have but there was someone already in it so I was diverted to the next one available.  It gave an impression of disorganization and the next available one, an "upgrade" wasn't anything impressive.  It was dirty inside and there was gray paint all over the hood.  With fees, I paid around $60.00 a day.  For this cost I just wasn't impressed.  The car was a very base model.  I drive the base Honda accord daily and used to it having USB ports..I had to stop and buy something to charge my car while driving.  And not that I wouldn't use Enterprise again...or Enterprise at this particular airport..but I have higher standards considering I have used Enterprise before.  I expected better.
