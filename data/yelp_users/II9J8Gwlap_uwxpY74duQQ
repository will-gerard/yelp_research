I have been coming here for years and today I decided it was time to write a review.  As usual it was great.  I swore i would try something different today however when our server arrived i decided to go with old faithful and again ordered Carnitas.  My coworkers order the Chile Relleno and a Burrito,  All were extremely good!!!  THe chips and Salsa are a must have.

My wife and I were celebrating our 13 wedding Anniversary here.  We were greeted with a Smile and a Happy Anniversary Mr. and Misses Kelly.  Your Table is ready, right this way please.  After being seated we were immediately visited by one of the servers and our Drink order was taken.  After looking at the Menu for a few minutes our waitress cam over and asked if there were any questions.  Asked and answered.  We ordered our meals I had the  Prime Rib with a baked potato and a vegetable. along with a salad.  All I can say is that from the salad to the desert this was a GREAT MEAL!!!  The Prime Rib was cooked PERFECTLY the best Prime Rib in AZ. to this point and I have eaten a lot of Prime Rib over the last 13 years.  My Wife had the same meal except she ordered the Rib Eye.  I had the privilege of tasting the Rib Eye and it was great to say the least.  I feel my wife and I  will become regulars at the Stockyards Restaurant.  Our Dinner came to approximately $140.00 and I left a $50.00 tip.  Thank You Stockyards Restaurant.

We have been having breakfast next door at Ronnie's for years and had never been here before tonight.  The food was amazing, the service was great!  The prices are very reasonable!  We will be regulars here moving forward.

Another night at Don Ruben's food outstanding as usual however the wait was extremely long because the lady at the front forgot where our name was and called five couples that came in after us and we were standing outside in the rain. not rain we were actually in the rain because we were underneath the awning however the point is is not really a service this trip

Got here and received BARR NONE the worst service from the rudest hostess I have ever seen!  When I said something she used the fact that they were semi busy as the excuse for being rude.  But when we looked in the restaurant lost of the tables were empty.  Now we know why.  We decided not to deal with her and went to the bar and enjoy the mediocre lunch at best.  After lunch we ordered pies to go which I will say were outstanding. Pie is a 8 service at the bar an 9, and the hostess well she showed up for work so I guess she gets a one by default.  Stop for the pie.  Have a drink at the bar and then run!

WORST STAY IN YEARS. Staff is very unprofessional.  Quoted prices and then did not honor the price quoted.  manager melody Was also very rude and not helpful at all when presented with the issues.  Rooms were Dirty.  Beds were clean, which is the only reason we ended up staying the night.  There are other hotels near by.  Try the comfort inn just down the road.  Very clean and a great staff. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!

Today must have been a bad day.  Went in to the store and it started like every other time we have been in the store.  Looked at the shirts, looked at the baked goods, then headed to the Deli Counter.  Saw a special on the glass.  any two different items 10.99.  I was not really interested in the meatball, lasangna, or Chicken Parm, just wanted some of their Italian Sausage.  So being it was 5:30 and they we closing in a few minutes I asked if I could get two of the sausages for the price of the special?  The very nice lady behind the counter said sure no problem.  So I began to    order for my wife son and I.  Ok I will have 2 specials,  My wife would like the Chicken Parm and the Meatballs, My son even though he is only 6 wanted the meatballs and the Lasanga, no worries I ordered the Meatballs and the Lasanga, and lastly I will have two Italian sausage.  at that point the not so pleasant fat, Short, guy from behind the counter yells they have to be two different things, then turns to the lady and states cant you read, how long have you worked here?  i began to explain and he yells again this time at me, If you want two sausages they are 6.99 a piece or you c an buy the at 5.49 a pound a take them home and cook them yourself.  I stated that if I wanted to cook dinner  I would not have come in.  he then yelled if you want us to cook them you can pay for them?  this was our cue to leave.  the poor girl behind the counter said she was sorry and he began to yell at her again.  As we got in our truck the girl came out and waved as she knew us from many past visits.  The food is ok at best however my wife being Italian liked the nostalgic feel of the place.  Now because of the rude behavior of the little fat man we will not be returning,  After 15 years we will buy our Italian Sausage elsewhere.

I wish I could write multiple reviews for this location. Went in to watch the NY Jets football game with a group of about 8.  (Jets bar) crowd was good, Food was good, service was good, bartender terrible!!!  When the game was not on he continued to blast the RAP MUSIC, when asked to turn up the game and turn down the Rap he refused saying, "Fuck em when I turn the music down the place is dead" it got to the point where bar regulars were having to go outside during commercials.  To rub salt into the wound he (he meaning the bartender) started turning up the volume when the Rap Music that was obviously bothering some of the older patrons.  Not being a fan of the disrespect towards customers I am not sure we will be returning.

This review is strictly for hostess.  We had a group of seven but one of our party is a very large man so we asked for a table for 8.  She said ok but then made it a joke shout out friend.  We decided to still have breakfast but it will be our last visit.  We have been coming here for years and they have just lost a good customer because of a hostess's decision to be disrespectful.  Which is something that is just not acceptable.  Oh.  In the off chance there is some confusion as to why we will not return?  WENDY is the reason.  Rudeness will not be tolerated.  You are in a service industry and she should be very aware of her surroundings!  I am sure she did not intend for my wife and her friend to hear her however they did.  Sorry Ronnie's.

WOW.   Trust me when I say This place is the only place to go for a burger!  If you like onion rings some of the best.  Let's not talk about their Fried Zucchini or their Ranch Dressing because they are just as good.  Oh and did I forget to say that everything is made from scratch.  Another place to put on your bucket list!

For three years I have been eating at different Oreganos restaurants around the valley. Bi go approximately 3 days a week to be exact.  Well today is the first time I have ever had to cancel an order.  It took them over 30minutes to make an antipasto salad.  Which I asked to be made without the cheese tons. Been they brought it out it in fact had them.  They said they would remove them and 15 minutes went buy and still no salad.  Being I had to return to work j asked to cancel the salad.  As we were getting ready to leave one hour after arriving they showed up with the salad that had been canceled and yes it still had the cheese tons on it.  I said no thank you to the gentleman and he in turn was very rude and stated loudly that all he wanted to do was take care of us and threw The salad across the bar to the trash.  I would have returned if he was not such an ass. Bee will not return to this establishment and I will tell our friends not to return as well!!!!

Very nice inside service was OK. I got the Baked Cod,  The vegetables were good and the salad was good as well.   However when I took a bite of the fish.... well the first thing I tasted was the large amount of lemon and then it hit me.  THE DAMN FISH WAS SPOILED.  I informed the bartender that was helping me and she took it back to the kitchen, when she returned she asked if I would like something else?  I said no thank you and asked for the check.  While I was waiting for the check the Manager came out and mentioned that he" took a bite of my fish and it did not seem that bad"  I told him to enjoy but I was going to pass.  Third bad experience at this location.  Pretty sure I will not be returning.

Arrived, and was greeted by a very nice young lady that seated me almost immediately.  This is where the good experience ended and the terrible one began. it took approximately 25 minutes for my server to arrive at my table to ask me what I wanted to drink,  About 10 minutes later my Diet Coke arrived and my server was off again.  Now realizing I was at the Airport I assumed that she was overly busy only to find out that all of her customers were being treated the same way.  In the time it took her to get me a drink and take my order the patron eating next to me arrived at his table, ordered, got his Tacos, ate, and left.  I was just ordering.  Different server of corse.  About 5 minutes after my neighbor patron left my serve appeared again asking me what I wanted to eat.  I ordered a Burrito, a Burro Pollo Poblano to be exact and a salad.  my food arrived 28 minutes later.  On a scale of 1 to 10, Taste 2, Would have been better if it was hot and the Tortilla was not hard and stale,  Appearance:  2, What looked like a half of a normal Burrito with a bowl of salad with no dressing.  Service:  0.5,  If it was only me i may have given it a two because i did get a refill on my soda.  Quality Control:  0  Food should never leave the kitchen in that condition.  Overall experience:  1  It I did not have a 2 hour flight and had not eaten all day I would have not eaten more than more than the 2 bites that I did eat, and sent it back after the first bite.  If the restaurant in Phoenix is as bad as this, I have just lost total respect for the James Beard committee that nominated this chef.

Very convenient however their BBQ at this location is probably some of the worst.  Te brisket was way over done and dry as well as being cut extremely thin.  If you are coining to sale it by the pound it should be sold like it thicker cuts.  The chicken on the other hand was ok.  If not for the chicken I would not have even given them 2 stars.  I hope there BBQ Sauce I good?  Because if they are counting on the meat, they are DOOMED and destined for failure!

I have been here twice now.  Both times the food was excellent!!  The Oysters are the freshest, and the Alaskan King Crab is out of this world.  A must for any foodies bucket list!

The worst theater ever.  They were out if hotdogs at the Snack bar at 5:30. There was no ice in the soda machines.  Speaking of the soda machines, the floor in front of them was so dirty that when I turned to leave my flip flop stayed there.  Told the person  that seemed to be in charge i got the response, "what would you like me to do about it?" And then walked away, if i had jot already told my son that we were going to see the movie i would have left.  I actually watched a few people leave saying this was ridiculous.  Then when we got into the theater it was a complete mess.  We will not be returning.
