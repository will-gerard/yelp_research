Quite possibly the worst service ever. It took 30 minutes to get our check. One of our party didn't get two of the items he ordered. To top it off, the manager did not stop by our table to see if we needed anything.  The food is decent, but the service is so bad if I come back it will be for take out.

The staff is always awesome. I love their liquids. I recommend trying Eternal Sunshine. Still my all time favorite from all of the shops liquids I've tried. Also, they have a rewards program...seriously, if you haven't been here to try their stuff, go.

I am generally a sprouts shopper, but I will say, this store and it's staff are amazing. I ordered a smoothie my first time in and the woman behind the counter made me the most amazing green smoothie. It was worth every penny.

The products at this shop are great. The prices are some of the lowest in the valley and they only stick quality items. Staff is friendly and knowledgable. Added bonus...comfy couches and a flat screen to chill and enjoy your vape. The shop just has an amazing vibe.

I worked with Wendy Weintraub from this team to find my first home. She allowed me to drive the process and offered expert advice when looking for the perfect home. With a little patience and a lot of driving around we found my home and purchased it at a great price. I highly recommend her and this group when looking for an agent to buy you first or next home.
