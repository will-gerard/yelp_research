My old salon shut down in Old Town. So I was on the hunt for a new one near my house.  I have now gone to Desert Nail Spa about 5 times and I am also going tomorrow!  They are quick & look great for week's.  This has been my new place to go & I don't plan on changing!

Great location! One block from the strip and across the street from Planet Hollywood and the miracle mile shops. I'm enjoying that I can go find the eventful happenings and return back to quiet.   The room has a kitchen and dining area creating a cozy place to do brunch in the morning before adventuring out.   We are planning on checking out the pool on the 38th floor today! Hopefully we have a great time!

Besides the overwhelmingly smell of yummy Lush has something for everyone. I am OBSESSED with Daddy-O the purple shampoo. It does wonders to my hair as far as cutting out the brassy look. I personally like to mix it 1/2 and 1/2 with my shampoo.   Save your empty face mask containers- I think for every 6 you get a free mask.   I'm also a fan of the bubble gum flavored lip scrub. It taste yummy and works well on maintaining soft lips.   The staff is SUPER friendly and helpful at this location. They always are involved in helping to find you the proper products.

I was able to enjoy this gem the last 3 nights for a work conference. This is by far is the best hotel I've ever stayed at in Vegas- the elegance of the staff, quiet charm of the hotel, large/lush rooms, amazing tubs and convenient to the strip.   I am definitely a fan!

The staff was friendly and welcoming. They were out of the smoked butterscotch latte- so I opted for a skinny vanilla latte. Upon arrival there was 5 people in front of me and I was out of there within 5 minutes.

Just left! Server took 10 minutes to greet the table. She couldn't even smile. We ordered 2 coronas and waters all around. No waters got delivered. She dropped off the food not even asking if we needed anything else. We ate, the food was good. Christin didn't check back in. At the end I had my card out to pay waiting. Overall she made the experience shitty.

One of my favorite Sunday funday spots. While walking in turn in your ID for some bags or paddles. Then head to the patio. We stop by the bar, place an order and grab a drink. Try the Room Service- YUM! My husband and I moved to Cali and are bummed we don't have anything like The Yard anymore.   Friendly staff, yard games and a great place to gather with friends!!  Tip: the parking lot is Valet only so be prepared to tip the guys. Other than that street parking is first come, first serve. So be ready to walk a bit.
