Took my car here after having a horror visit at a different local auto shop and was beyond please with the help and information that I received from Johnson's!  They are running a great family operation that values honesty and integrity which is very important when it comes to auto work! I will be working with them from here on out for any of my automotive needs!

The food sucks and so does the service beware of the old Asian lady Linda she is the worst! Super attitude and can barely even speak! Avoid this place at all costs it's not worth your money or disappointment! Just say no

Chen WACK is what I call it! I would have given it no stars if I could. This place has failed to meet the mark way too many times hence my review. I don't write about places to often good or bad but at this point I feel that if I can save someone time, money, disappointment, and sickness then it's my duty! This place lacks in the flavor department hardcore. 90% of the food is bland! It's just horrible in my opinion! They give you great portions but the quality is very lacking! Avoid this place at all costs! Unless you go in the back and help them season and marinate the food your getting plan on eating chinese that has no soul or flavor.

This place is good in my book!!!! Nice portions on the sandwiches, and not to mention they have cheesecake that is simply AMAZING!!!!! Don't sleep on JASON'S DELI, they definitely are handling some big business over here!

So needless to say Native New Yorker is definitely not the place that it used to be! In years past it was easily a better go to than many competitors but these days it's a mess! I can't speak to the quality of all food but the wings which they are known for (or at least used to be) are terrible now! I have given this particular location countless tries to see if they can get it together but I'm constantly let down. Most recently I ordered 48 wings on a weekday, midday mind you and went to pick them up. There was hardly any people in the place yet I was waiting for a waitress at the front for over 5mins then I walked around to the bar for assistance and they said they would get it boxed up and ready. So I wait another 10mins for them to bring them out and finally she brings them and I head home. I get home and what do you know the wings are soggy and very under sauced!!! I'm like really?!?!? I normally would just deal with it but I've had enough of this under performance from this establishment. So I call to see about bringing them back and getting a refund and I'm put on hold for the manager who then picks up and then hangs up. So I call right back and the manager answers the phone with no greeting other than hello....I'm like is this native New Yorker and she rudely says "yes what can I do for you" so I explain what's going on and she just says "come down and we will get it figured out". I get down there and as the manager she doesn't even have the decency to come up front and handle the situation she has the waitress running back and forth relaying messages. Being in customer service and being a manager myself I was completely thrown off by her utter disregard for making the situation right. I'm completely done with this place I will give my business to much more deserving companies!

Wonderful atmosphere and ambiance! The service is amazing and the filet mignon was the absolute best piece of meat i have had to date! Definitely more on the pricey side but worth every cent! A must try for fine dining!

Wish I could give this place NO STARS! They continue to drop the ball on customer service and food quality. I mean you can't expect much from McDonald's period these days but GEEZE! This place is a joke! They manage to mess up the simplest orders and then proceed to give as much attitude as possible when correcting any issue. This location needs to go back to the drawing board! Send the whole staff back to McDonald's university so they can be retrained on EVERYTHING!!! If you are tempted to stop here think twice and if it's not too far go to the McDonalds inside of Walmart at El Mirage and Thunderbird it's much better.

Absolutely love this place!!! So pleased that it arrived in the Surprise area! This location has great employees and service and if they ever do make a mistake (which has happened only once in the 100+ times I've been there) they are very quick to make sure that you are friendly and properly taken care of! Love me some Freddy's!

No lie this place is awesome! The guys here genuinely care about helping you out! I have the pleasure of have Jeremy & Larry helping me out with my brake lights and turning signals. After dealing with the less than helpful likes of auto zone employees who did nothing but make assumptions of the issue, I was pleased to have these two gentlemen take the time to step by step help me pinpoint the issue! I can't voice enough how grateful I am for the help and services that O'reillys provides and the wonderful employees that they have at their stores. This one in particular is SUPER AMAZING! Keep up the good work fellas.
