Trendy atmosphere, friendly yet slow staff, good sandwich but not mind-blowing. Maybe I expected too much.

Food and beer here are amazing.  I live downtown and try my hardest not to go here all the time since I want to try other spots. The service is pretty good even when busy and they have a TV so I can watch some games.

Loved the beer choices, loved the video games, loved the board games. Came here for my birthday and couldn't have had a better, more relaxed, and exciting experience. Didn't get to eat due to busy atmosphere and late arrival.
