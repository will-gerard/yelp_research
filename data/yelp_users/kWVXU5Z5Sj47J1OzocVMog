Ok, so you may have noticed from other reviews of mine that I'm anal-retentive about a lot of things. Especially researching things that I do to my body.   I've been wanting to get my eyebrow pierced, as well as a few new holes in my ear cartilage. Figured that would help the whole "butch" image. Shut up, I'm shallow.   I'm also incredibly needle-phobic. So what the hell am I doing at Halo? Confronting that shit head on, thank you very much.  Decided I wanted to go with Halo on the good recommendations of fellow yelpers and friends. Decided to start small. I wanted to stretch my pre-existing holes. I figured that would give me a good sense of the shop, their staff, and their procedures. It wouldn't cost a fortune, and I'd work up the nerve to have real needles shoved through my face.  One star for incredible jewelry selection.  One star for insane, OCD appeasing sanitation standards.  One star for a pleasant and streamlined procedure. One star for Jeremiah, for not laughing at me wincing over  a two gauge stretch. Also for letting me name the pickled punk on the shelf "Fredrick." *  (You should really google "Pickled Punk" if you don't know what it is).  *That final star is pending on how the piercing goes, and is not being withheld by any fault of the shop or staff. I'm beyond pleased with the new jewelry in my ears and the whole experience. I'm actually going to schedule that eyebrow ring sooner, I'm so pleased. Needle-phobia be damned.

5 stars. Halo get's 5 stars from me, and a happy five at that. Not only for my experience getting my brow pierced, but for the way Jetta R. was treated (a first timer).   Ana had an incredible bedside manner, put us both at ease, was professional, efficient and charming. Yes, I find foul mouthed, authoritative women immensely charming. See also: Jetta R.   I cannot stress enough how reassuring it was to get body mods from someone who so obviously LOVES body mods. Ana obviously knows her trade, not only as a piercer but as a piercee. My needle-phobia subsided in her capable hands/tongs.   The barbell was not placed in a way I would have asked for, but I trusted that Ana knew "good placement" better than I did. And she did. It looks amazing. Jetta R.'s ears look amazing. Everything was amazing.   I'm trying to think of other things I can pierce just so I have an excuse to go back. Surely there's more room on me...  That's not healthy, is it?

You know, it doesn't bode well for an establishment when the Jetta R. has to preface the visit with advice that I "brace" myself. If the food is at all decent it wouldn't require an introduction warning me about the lack of "atmosphere" or "warmth."   Literally, Dragon Garden has all the ambiance of a Dunkin' Doughnuts. Sterile white, pop-in lettered menu boards, humming soft drink case. Cafeteria-y. Staffed by my mother's body double who wasn't doing any cool stunts. Bummer.  Jetta R. ordered the Shrimp in Lobster Sauce. I didn't dare stray too far into the menu. I ordered the same. Hey, I like lobster sauce. And it comes with an egg roll and some fried wantons and fried rice. Groovy.   Ok, this is not lobster sauce. This is "viscous white goo with eggy bits that tastes mildly of chicken broth." 5-6 shrimps dwarfed by GIANT chunks of green bell pepper and onion. It didn't taste bad, just bland. Fried wantons full of dried out pork. Moving on. Egg roll tastes like Wong's. Speculated that maybe the staff just walks across the street and orders their day's supply there. Again, not bad, just bland. Fried rice = dry rice tossed in soy sauce. I ended up picking out the shrimp, eating the egg roll, and considered the rest a loss. Might have been salvageable with hot sauce, but there was none to be found.   Dragon Garden has a few things going for it. You get more volume for your dollar on the lunch specials, so it's good if you need to fill up quick and you're not picky. You'll probably never have to wait in line. The staff is nice and the kitchen is quick. Everything seems very clean, and the food is pretty basic Chinese-American fare.    TL; DR version: Go for lunch specials, bring hot sauce.

You have to understand, I have this love/hate relationship with my stomach. I have a masochistic addiction to terrible, terrible food. And BWWs is the culinary dominatrix of my dreams.  Buffalo Wild Wings will punish you. The queso dip will dominate your GI tract. The hot sauces will humiliate your palate. The potato wedges will whip your insides to a frenzy (ok, that one was a stretch - you try keeping an S&M food analogy going more than three lines).  Oh BWWs, I kneel in supplication. Your hot wings deliver, your popcorn shrimp are awful/wonderful, and I dream about your queso dip when I'm away. I even love your pathetic attempt at nachos. Oh I know the pain will come, but I'll take it. You're cheap and dirty, just how I like it.

This is where Jetta R takes me when I'm having a bad day and no amount of foot-rubs or comic books can appease me. No matter how grumpy I get, one spoonful of cheesecake flavored custard makes my toes wiggle.   Apparently it's just ice cream, but mixed with less air so it's thicker and creamier. I don't care how they make it, it's almost better than sex. Frozen treats don't get any more eye-rollingly good.   I remember that the girl who served us the first time we went was pregnant. I remember thinking "man, what a sweet fucking job to have when you're pregnant." I have never been served a delicious frozen desert by a happier looking woman. That's the beauty of leaps. It's bliss in a cup.   Coldstone wishes it could taste this delicious. But it can't. Because it's not Frozen Custard. Yes, the capitalization is necessary.

As Amanda B already updated, Leap's is, indeed, closed down.   No explanation was given except that they had violated something in the lease. Notice was dated 11/29/2008. Everything's still inside, like a little ghost store.   I could cry. Really, I could. Not even Jetta R's usual wit and charm could cheer me up again.   BRING BACK LEAP'S!

This place left a bad taste in my mouth. We made the mistake of going on father's day with my best friend's dad (his choice). The place was nearly empty and it still took almost an hour to get our food. We had to ask management if we'd been forgotten. The group that came in after us were served well before us, even though I'm pretty sure they put their order in a few minutes after ours.  I ordered BBQ chicken nachos, thinking they would be nachos with barbecued chicken. That makes sense, right? I got chicken on top of chips covered in BBQ sauce. It's my fault. I come from a place where barbecue is a method, not necessarily a flavor.   Minus a star for the bad food. Minus two stars for the terrible service. And minus a star for being Fox.   Sorry, that's how I roll.

Being a die-hard Greek food fan, I was hesitant to try a Greek chain. But lo and behold the food is actually pretty good, even if it veers slightly askew of "traditional."   The tzatziki is amazing, but heavy on the lemon flavor. The spanakopita is huge and delightful. Their gyros come wrapped in a green tortilla (wha?) but are otherwise tasty. Baklava - get it! - but don't share if you don't have to. Oh, the baklava is big enough to share, but you won't want too. I love going in early on a weekend when the place is practically empty.

I hate pho. I do. I hate almost all Asian food save Malaysian, Thai and Indian. And those can be pretty interchangeable considering the former is often a hodgepodge of the latter. I find pho boring, and only eat it when I'm sick. You know this. You read Jetta R's review already.  So what's with the 5 stars, right?  I'm a skeptic to the extreme. We ordered Thai iced tea and I was very, very dissapointed (and a wee bit smug) that theirs comes right out of the can. That was all it took for me to cross my arms and begin the nay-saying. We're waiting for her General Tsao Chicken, and my Orange Chicken lunch special. Poor Jetta's puppy-dog-facing me over the table, trying to placate my snide and pessimistic predictions about the food we'd yet to be served.   "Watch. It's going just to be plain chicken breasts with orange slices on top."  And then it came, and I shut my mouth. It was so...pretty. Fried rice shaped into a perfect little mound. Crispy chicken glistening in sweet-but-not-too-sweet-even-if-you're-super-picky-like-me sauce. And the taste. OMG. I'm a believer in Chinese food again. Chinese food from a Vietnamese restaurant. And sprinkled throughout - why yes, tiny little mandarin orange slices, cut into quarters.   What the hell, Pholicious? Are you trying to kill me with perfection? I've got a reputation to keep.   Maybe it was a fluke. Maybe I could still hate this place. Jetta and I returned today, me with chopsticks in hand and ready for a show down. It's on now, bitches. Kung Pao Chicken. Bring it.   And they did, while smiling and telling my bestie she looked pretty today. Damn, they're sneaky!  And the chicken?     ...perfect. Again. Jetta's pho? Also perfect. And I HATE pho.  You win this time, Pholicious. I admit defeat. Take your 5 stars while I sulk off into the sunset.   Can we rematch tomorrow?

There is no way any single restaurant can live up to the 5 stars of so many heavy-hitting Phoenix Yelpers, srsly. This place must be a myth.   That's what I thought as we made our way down to the tiny (i mean, tiny) hole in the wall that is Pizza A Metro.  We got a pizza in the "metro" size, which basically means "this is the inside dimension of our oven/this is the biggest pizza we can possibly make" size.  I had a foodgasm, and I'm not ashamed to admit it. I was, however, a little ashamed to do it in front of my best friend's mother.   "Oh, he's fine, Mom. He just really likes basil."  I cannot wait to go back and try everything on the menu.  Go. Go now. Your lunch/dinner plans have just been shanghaied. You will thank me later.

When my partner decided that shaving facial hair was just not cutting it (too much beard shadow under the skin) we initially though to get it waxed out. I was hesitant to go the wax route, and was thrilled to find Jada in the Desert Sky mall (inside near Mervyn's). This place only does threading and henna tattooing.   The shop is small and personal. It's not the most luxe of interiors, but the brisk and professional service makes up for it. Having not had the threading myself, I can only attest that they threaded out my partners beard (all of it, cheeks chin neck and mustache) in about an hour and only charged us $35 for it. We were very pleased with the results and stoked about the low cost.   More than a handful of stray, missed hairs and a lack of lotion or balm after the procedure keeps this rating from a 5, but so long as you can provide your own aftercare I would still highly recommend Jada Beauty.  For those of you who have never been "threaded" it's a hair removal process where hair is trapped between a twisted strand of thread and pulled out by the root. There are no chemicals and no blades. It's excellent for people with sensitive or allergic skin, but don't think you're getting out of the pain of hair removal - it still hurts! Results last a similar amount of time as traditional waxing.

My partner and I go here almost every night, so I can tell you a lot about the place.  Don't bother with the "food" food, if you can. It's not that it's bad food, but it's almost never worth what they're asking for it. What makes this place awesome is Happy Hour, with lowered drink costs and half priced appetizers. Sunday - Thursday has a second Happy Hour from 10pm - Midnight (kitchen closes at 11:30).  Appetizers I've had:  California Roll. (4 stars) Amazing. It in no way resembles real sushi (but do California rolls ever count as "real" sushi?). The dish is served as a rice "cake" topped with crab and tabiko, cucumber and avocado. The plate is drizzled with a wasabi soy sauce and dollops of Sri Racha chili sauce.  Spicy Tuna Roll (5 stars) My favorite. And at happy hour prices the most sushi bang for your buck. Same "cake" style as the California roll, but without rice. Just spicy tuna, edamame, cucumber. I'm a sucker for spicy raw tuna, and there's TONS of it in this dish. I've never been able to finish a whole one. Oh snap, Atkins friendly appetizer?  Calamari. (4 stars) A pretty big portion with two types of dipping sauce. The calamari tasted fresh and tender - not rubbery, and the batter was light enough to not overwhelm the taste of the squid.  Chinese Garlic Noodles. (3 stars) It's good enough, but it's just garlicky noodles covered in parmesan with big hunks of mushrooms. A good starchy filler if you're really hungry/plan on drinking heavily.  Blue Crab Cakes (3 stars) These are actually delicious, but what keeps them from being 4 star is that you only get two and they're falafel sized (so be sure to get them when they're $6 during happy hour). The mango chutney was a nice touch.  Spinach Cheese (3 stars) The dip is alright, certainly heavy on the spinach (a plus) but it's served with deep fried pita. Seriously, why can't they serve it with baked pita or something that hasn't been dredged in oil? Seemed ill thought out to me.  Margheretia Pizza (4 stars) This little pizza (8 slices, thin crust) is incredibly light and tasty, with whole cloves of roasted garlic - YUM.  Four Cheese Pizza (3 stars) Fontana, Parmesan, Ricotta and Mozzarella. Not overpowering, good balance of flavor, but the giant lumps of ricotta keep it from being a 4 star for me.  Onion Ring Tower (3 stars) It's got a cute little serving plate (the onions are stacked around a central "pole") but it's just your basic onion ring - a little on the oily side, which might be excellent if you're pairing it with one of Yardhouse's many, many (MANY), draft beers.  Sliders (4 star) Comes in "Classic" or "Barnaise." I think I prefer the classic, because I find bearnaise off-putting, but it does come on the side and that style of slider has fried onion strings (but no cheese). Both styles come with shoe string fries and a pickle. $5.95 for either at happy hour, but I'd almost pay full price for these.  If you ARE in the mood for "food" food, then please, at all costs avoid the Mac and Cheese. It's advertised as a "grown up" version, but in this case "grown up" means oil. Oily cheeses, oily bacon, and...truffle oil? The one time I tried it I needed to pile noodles up on the sides of the plate in an attempt to let the puddle of oil drip off. This wasn't a little puddle either, it was practically a lake in the middle of the bowl. I abandoned it about a third of the way through.  The Creme Brule is good, but not worth the $8.25.
