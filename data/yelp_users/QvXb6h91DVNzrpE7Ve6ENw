First time there and it was great. Wonderful service and chef Sarah Baer was rock'n Our server Brittney  suggested a good spanish wine and sparkling sprite on the rocks. But the best part of the dinner was the amazing, teeth rotting s'mores with homemade marshmallow. I don't care if I have to gum my food for the rest of my life I would eat that homemade marshmallow all day long. Thanks for a wonderful evening.

I haven't been there in 5yrs and I may not be going back. The chicken, the side and the not so good butter nut squash sauce was yuck. It's definitely not worth $17. It shows because on a Saturday night there wasn't a long wait. They changed something that was once good

Good fun in Las Vegas. You all might find it strange but I've been on an escargot kick. So I had chef Keller's escargot with black garlic. Good flavorful mild garlic and tender. But chef Ludo's escargot was tastier. It's prepared differently so maybe not fair comparison. Sorry chef. But still devoured it!

Since they changed the wings to this awful breaded thing I don't order. I miss the old 10 cent wings

The guys are great here and service excellent. This is THE place to stuff your face with yummy philly chz steak with spicy blue chz sauce dripping down your chin and feel at home.

Waited 3hrs to sit. 5:30 to 8:33 the worse system for seating. Don't ever go!

The only sushi in town. Pfft. Went a few time to get a fix and recently it was not good. Salmon was tasteless and slightly chewy. Hamachi had a funky texture and taste ugh just disappointing. And how can you go wrong with eel? But they did manage that. I'm going to take some time away, step back give them time to step up their game and maybe try again next year. Until then it looks like Frys sushi for a quick fix.

Shredded beef burrito was good though not enough heat. Service was good. Definitely should visit.

I drove by this place once and thought it looked like a great place. And yes it was. The burger was excellent, a good recommendation from Alex. I will be back to try the fillet.

First repair i had Eddie fix for me. Great job! He diagnosed the issue with my Passat got it fixed and was really fair on the price. He's fast to respond and really thorough. Really good customer service. Support your local business because they are your neighbors.
