Hours listed on Yelp last night shows Mi Amigos closed at 11pm. A group of us ,driving 4 separate cars parked and paid for parking at the Arizona Center. We arrived around 10:25pm and were all told they were closed. When we told them about the hours, they said it was for a different location.  The food here is just gringo Mexican anyways and service is sub standard but they listed they were opened and others showed closed. I won't  be going back.

A Real Barber Shop for Real Men.  I really enjoyed my first cut at Gio's. The place looks like an old time barber shop, no frills, not pretty, just a great place to get your hair cut.  I came here because my long time barber (Nodari) just moved here from one of those big pretty boy chains.  You get good conversation a good cut and a reasonable price here and they even have a hot towel for you if you want one.  I will be back soon.  Ask for Nodari and if it is your first visit, use the $5 off coupon I used.  I found the coupon on the web at www.GiosBarber.com    Hairs to you,  Cheers.

Sushi that won't strain your budget.  Kyoto Japanese has been my go to place for Sushi for 25+ years now.  Lunch is the best value in town.  If you are looking for a swank, place to be seen Sushi joint, then head down the street to one of the other plentiful Japanese / Sushi restaurants.  If you are looking for a place with good sushi at a reasonable price and a friendly staff to serve you, then visit Kyoto.  I did notice that they recently raised prices after 25 years but I think you can still afford it. The price for a Tuna Roll is now a whooping $4.  Come on....you can't beat that and it is always fresh.   The Teppanyaki tables are fun and entertaining.  Oh, almost forgot......A Sake Bomber / Sake with a 22oz Beer is just $6 (at least last time I checked)   If you have not been to Kyoto, be sure to make this one of your upcoming destinations.

Really Love this place. I have been coming here for 5 years now and have never reviewed it. $1 Gulf Oysters and $5 Svedka Martinis on Happy Hour. The Bone in Ribeye and Hong Kong Chilean Sea Bass are the best in town.

Business really deserves ZERO STARS  but the massage therapist are great so I will be generous on this one The management at the PV Store and Corporate Office are horrible. My wife and I have been dealing with the manager (Let's call her by her first initial "H")  and the corporate office ( "R")  for over 6 months now on a cancelled membership and  they cant seem to fix and credit us what is due.  I had the same issue on my membership but it was with another location and they fixed it immediately.    This office is totally not organized and continues to charge our account even though we cancelled over 6 months ago and they have even admitted fault via the phone and in person but still can't seem to correct the issue. We now have been paying interest on over $150 in wrongful charges for 6 months   Massage Envy is a great deal but if they don't change management, I suggest you find another option.

Been eating here for 2 years now, at least 2 times a week and it rarely disappoints. Can't beat the quality, quantity and price of the lunch specials.    My favorites are the Panay Chicken and Pad Thai Chicken.   Busy place at lunch but fast turn times.   A recommend from me for sure.

I have been going to Hawaiian Experience Spa for a while now and always enjoy my treatments. What I like most about the membership plan is that I can try many different massage treatments. Today was exceptional, my therapist Dorena was phenomenal at Lomi Lomi. Absolutely the best way to start my day. It's closing time now and I am still feeling great.

I looked online and it said that USPS never picks up phone at local offices.  I just called and though it took a couple of minutes, they did pick up and were very helpful.  They apologized and explained they would definitely call me back to day to help me with my issue. They just needed to get the mail carriers out with today's mail and then they would work on it.  I have also visited this office on several occasions and they have always been helpful.  Way to go USPS!

Classic Charm.  Hang out with your friends here.  This Bar / Restaurant has a classic back east bar feel with chandeliers, wood floors and leather through out.  The servers were very attentive and the drinks and food were enjoyable. A comfortable place to socialize, whether young or old.  They have a great private room for events, complete with a one- way mirror and concealed bookshelf door. Old Town is lucky to have this venue.

Kudos to Pita Jungle.  You can expect Consistency and Good Service when you dine at Pita Jungle.  I have been to several Pita Jungles in town and one thing for sure is that your food will be very consistent and your server will be attentive.   My experience at PJ Downtown Phoenix last night was excellent.  It was late, almost closing time and my wife and I were greeted as if the restaurant was just opening up for the day.  We did not feel rushed at any time and the server was very attentive. We shared a Caramelized Chicken Pizza (Lavosh) and a small Greek salad.  The flavors were great.  I do think that a Greek salad should have Kalamata  olives on it and they don't do that at P J.   Good Value, Great Locations and Great Service is what you will find at Pita Jungle.

Sitting here at a very painful Valentine's Lunch. Service is poor and when they brought my wife Steak Tetaki sald, it was well done. Typically this is prepared rare seared and when we mentiined it was well done the server just said that's the way it's cooked here. Wow.  Forgot part of our order, did not bring a drink we ordered, etc. Etc. Finally got the check, now need to go find lunch for my wife.   Not coming back.

Stingray redeemed itself. After my last not so good review of Stingray, Bryan the manager reached out to me and apologized ,saying that they were understaffed and assured me that this was not typical service. He asked that I give them another try.   Today we did just that and the food and service were fantastic. Sunday's are industry day and happy hour is all day. Great deals!  Thanks Stingray for taking the time to respond.

Okay, I have been at Studio Movie Grill 3 times now and have given them several chances to shine, unfortunately they remain dull.  If you want to watch a movie, go for it, they have comfortable seating but don't waste your money on the food and drink, actually the drinks are okay but there are plenty of fast food restaurants in the area that have more fresh food at a much reduced price.  Tonight we spent $75 on a couple of entrees and drinks. I don't mind spending that kind of money but I expect fresh, hot food and this food was obviously sitting for a long time waiting to be served, it was ice cold and so was the food of the people around us. Everyone was complaining but by the time you get a replacement meal, the movie is ending so you may as well just eat before or after the film.  I predict that studio movie grill will go the way of the drive in theaters.

Maybe it was an off night?  This is the worst review I have given.  It is my Son's 26th birthday today so we met up with him at Brat Haus.  I had a really good feeling about this place due to it's current star rating on Yelp and the way it is designed.  It  has a really cool vibe.  The service and food were not acceptable.  The Scottsdale market demands good food and this place is not making the cut. My son ordered a Chorizo Dog and he sent it back (no flavor). My wife and I split a burger and they did not ask how I wanted it cooked. The burger arrived and it was well done and the only flavor I could taste in it was a strong taste of pepper?  It was horrible, I am sure they cook it to death because the quality of the beef won't allow them to cook it on the rare side.  I did not drink but we had plenty of beer lovers at the table who were ready to have a beer or two but they had a hard time getting a server to stop by and take their order.    I tried some of the other's food and the only thing I found to be tasty was the pretzel fundido.  Not sure I will try Brat Haus again.

I love this place.  I have had dinner here several times and enjoyed it very much. Service and Food quality are excellent.  Salumi Boards, Liver Pate and Ravioli are among my favs. Great food deals during happy hour but not such great cocktail/martini prices. The place is a little pricey but WELL worth the price. Oh..one more thing, the bread is to die for.

What I love about this place is that if you want a short or a long hike, grueling or just enjoying the scenery,  this the place to go. Doesn't hurt that it is 3/4 mile from my house. They always have guide volunteers on hand to direct you to the right trail and maps to go along with the hike. Beauty all around. Give it a try.

This is my Wife and my favorite Italian Restaurant for sure. Whether you enjoy them for Happy Hour or for a full meal experience, you will not be disappointed. From the time you walk in the door and are greeted by the host or hostess you feel welcomed. The inviting decor is urban yet classy.  Frernando is the owner along with his wife Paula and they are they go out of their way to make you feel like family.   We have enjoyed some great handcrafted cocktails,wines, Pizza, Meatballs,  House made Pastas, Beef, Chicken and Seafood dishes along with some mouth watering desserts and all were EXCELLENT.  Very energetic atmosphere and is not the place to go if you want to be intimate with your partner.  if you want to have some great food and drinks and feel like you are sitting down to a meal with your family, this is the place to be.   Reminds me of dinner at Noni's House.
