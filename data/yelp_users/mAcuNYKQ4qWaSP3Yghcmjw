Starting my BB summer habits early this year. Nothing beats the heat better than a Bahama Rama Mama!! Current favorite: strawberry colada + coconut. Mmmmmm

Nothing about the Italian sandwich is Italian. It was gross. I've never not finished an Italian sandwich until today. The Wisconsin Cheese soup tastes like Velveeta. My water was my favorite part of the meal.

Parking is a cluster if you come after noon. Come a few minutes before and you're golden.

I have been to other stores that offer similar activities, but none that include so many creative activities. The spatial layout of the store is conducive to a variety of groups, ages, activities, and creative opportunities. The staff were absolutely wonderful. They helped us as much or as little as we wanted, gave a lot of various ideas, and made it an enjoyable experience. I can't wait to go back and try something else, and to take family and friends with me!

One of the better sandwich shops in the valley, and the Italian sandwich is fantastic. 'Nuff said.
