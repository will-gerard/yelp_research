I've given two stars because in the beginning, they were great.  A far cry from their service now. I used snappy lawn service for more than three years, and have finally thrown in the towel (shame on me for not doing so sooner).  Having two rental properties in the Tempe/Phoenix area, and living out of state, Snappy has been a struggle to deal with and their customer service (or lack thereof) has been frustrating at best.  The woman who answers the phone (I believe her name is Lisa?) is never friendly and has a demeanor on the phone which epitomizes the company name - snappy. (Oh, you're right, I guess the fact that I'm getting HOA letters about weeds is really my fault!)  I could write pages, but I'll summarize with the example of just one home which has a small lawn, lots lot of foliage and flowers, plus three palm trees.  Not a large yard, but beautifully landscaped and requiring attention. Skip to now: the lawn is atrocious, two of the palm trees are dead and may not be salvageable, and we've lost countless plants.  Twice I've been down to inspect, have been shocked at the condition, and have had to call Snappy to understand how this could have happened without being brought to my attention.  Long story short, the lawn will never be the same.    Additionally there were several discrepancies with the billing that came up from time to time. Do yourself a favor and find someone else to take care of your lawn needs.

I'll never go to a regular theatre again (if I can help it)! FInally, I can watch a movie and enjoy wine in luxury - and I'm not talking about my couch.  I'm surprised it's taken so long for this concept to reach Scottsdale, but am glad to see it's here.  And in the Scottsdale Quarter no less.  I highly recommend going for the "Gold Class" seats as opposed to the 'Premium' seats: confusing, but the Premium seats are the basic, and  for only a few dollars more the Gold Class seats come with free popcorn, free valet, AND.... in-theatre service!!!  Not to mention the large couch-like seats electronically recline to a position that can only be described as sitting up in bed; and the kind host will offer you a pillow and blanket. Yes, please!  They serve Salt's full menu, and the wine list is pretty decent.  My friends and I had a wonderful time, the service was excellent, and the food and wine spectacular.  If the movie was bad, I didn't mind. Two-thumbs way up!

Hands down my favorite brunch spot in Scottsdale.  The cute cottage interior coupled with the umbrella-garden patio make the perfect ambiance for brunch with the girls (it's in fact our weekly ritual).  Not exactly a man's great escape - every time I go (which is more than often) there is undoubtedly a bridal or baby shower in process. But if you men only try the food, I'm sure you won't mind the gaggle of women.    I recommend the goat cheese appetizer to start, and the chicken and leak crepes - to die for.  Though just about everything I've tried has been outstanding, I don't think you can go wrong. They also offer a mimosa special: a bottle of champagne and orange juice for $20, but you have to ask for it.   Bon-a-petit!
