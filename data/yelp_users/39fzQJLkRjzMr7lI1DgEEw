I had such a bad experience with this dry cleaner that I've literally been thinking about writing this review for months--now that my Yelp account is up and running, this business is first on my list of reviews to write.  The customer service was extremely poor -- the business is advertised as a "1 hr Cleaner" -- per their own sign-- and when I requested that a suit be cleaned by the following day, the girl working behind the desk gave me a really hard time, saying it would be difficult, etc., etc. What the heck? Are you a one hour cleaner or not? After some back and forth, we established that my suit would be clean by the next day.  Then, as she was looking through my pile of clothes she just handed me back a tank top that had a small stain, simply saying "she wouldn't be able to get it out." I'm sorry, but the reason I bring stained clothes to the dry cleaner is so they can at least attempt to take the stain out -- if they've tried and failed, that's fine. But handing me back a shirt after a cursory glance and flat-out telling me it's ruined isn't exactly a best effort.  Needless to say, I left this dry cleaner with a sour taste in my mouth. Just all-around bad customer service and mediocre dry-cleaning.

Had dinner here last night based on a recommendation - Tesoro did not disappoint!!   I ordered the Ravioli, and when I couldn't decide between meat and cheese, our server offered that the kitchen make it half & half - perfect! That said, I think the cheese version wins out! The rest of my table also stuck with classic dishes - lasagna & spaghetti al Pomodoro, both of which were executed wonderfully and also tasted delicious.   Important to note - the restaurant is tiny (probably 15 tables) so you should definitely make a reservation! I wouldn't want to wait.   Overall, a wonderful dining experience with great atmosphere, service, and food!

LOVE The Platinum Spray Tan.   I scoured Yelp when I moved to Phoenix to find a great AIRBRUSH spray tan studio -- no Mystic tans for me thanks, I'll pass on being orange. The Platinum Spray Tan is the first place I tried two years ago, and I'm still a loyal customer today.  First and most importantly-- my tan always turns out looking great. Sometimes I'd like to be darker, and sometimes lighter -- I simply explain what I want to look like and it comes out wonderful every time. I've also done the 1-hour, which is more a light, sun-kissed glow, but SO worth it when you're naturally ghost-y like I am and find yourself in a tanning emergency.  Next -- MJ will book appointments via text, which is AMAZING. Calling and trying to schedule is so annoying, so being able to text MJ and get a response is fab.  Finally -- appointment scheduling is soooo flexible!! I have literally texted MJ as late as day-of, in a panic because I need a tan before the next day, and she's sprayed me at 8pm. Just amazing customer service.   MJ is friendly, beautiful, and GREAT at what she does, which explains her successful business. Will be a loyal customer as long as I live in the Valley!

Yelp describes two stars as "Meh. I've experienced better." How fitting - my EXACT feelings on Distrito.   Myself, my boyfriend, and another couple from out of town had dinner at the restaurant on Saturday night, as we were staying at the Saguaro to enjoy the pool and Old Town Scottsdale. We were seated promptly for our reservation -- in fact, the restaurant was nearly empty at 7:30 on a Saturday night -- weird, but okay.   We ordered drinks - the guys ordered the Mexican mules, which they said were pretty good. I ordered an Elderflower margarita, which I would NOT recommend. It had a very syrupy taste. I asked the server if I could please order another drink instead, and he said sure, and brought me a glass of wine, telling me the wine was "on the house" since I didn't like the original drink. Very nice, but unnecessary. Well, surprise surprise, when the bill came the margarita - more expensive by about $4, and taken away from the table - was still on the check! Um, would have rather paid for the drink I actually had.   The food was just okay. Everyone at the table ordered some variety of tacos, and we all agreed that the tortillas were far too thick and overwhelmed the small amount of toppings.  For me, the service is what sealed the deal on never coming back to Distrito again -- when there are SO MANY great restaurants in the area, Distrito should realize that service is what sets you apart. We waited over 30 minutes to place an order. My friend waited that same amount of time to get her drink, after asking twice. When we were trying to place an order, a server walked by and we said "excuse me" -- he made eye contact and kept walking. No thanks!   I would recommend spending your time and money at another Old Town restaurant that will give you great food and service!!!

115 5-star reviews for a cell phone repair shop? Considering how unhappy most people are to be paying to replace a smashed iPhone screen, I think that says a lot.  After dropping my iPhone on the pavement this morning while getting into my car & shattering the upper corner, I was not pleased to add another errand to the day -- screen replacement. Having never replaced a screen before, I was uncertain what I'd be dealing with price-wise, and was a little hesitant to end up in some sketchy shop.  I found this place quickly (thanks, Yelpers) and headed down during lunchtime (heads up - the employee said Monday lunch is their busiest time of the week). I was out the door within 20 minutes with a good-as-new screen and a new tempered glass cover, for a total of $140 ($120 for just the screen repair).   Needless to say, this could have been an annoying experience, but Nextech definitely made it as pleasant as possible!

PET OWNERS BEWARE.  My boyfriend and I dropped our miniature schnauzer off for a full groom at Cage Free (we had taken him in a few times before) and got a call a couple hours later that Henry had been "cut" and that they didn't feel comfortable continuing his groom until we took him to the vet. Um, okay we're worried.  So we go to pick him up, and he has a DEEP gash on his stomach - I.e., when you pick him up, you can see muscle/tissue. We drove him to his vet immediately, and they said he absolutely needed staples/stitches while under anesthesia, and 2 weeks of antibiotics and painkillers post-op. Henry got the staples/stitches that day, and when we picked him up he was in SERIOUS pain. As in, when a friend walked through the door later that night and he barked to greet her, he was yelping in pain. On top of the pain our dog had to endure, this trip to the vet cost us $350.  We called Cage Free & spoke with the owner to let him know we would be expecting that he refund us the cost of the vet bill - or at least split the cost of the vet bill. He reminded us that he had "already given us a free grooming." Yes, he meant the one where Henry had gotten sliced. We would have never paid for that, obviously. Then he refused to pay any part of the vet bill, and instead offered us 3 free grooms. No thanks, I'll never be returning here again. Needless to say, Cage Free Grooming is not a place where the customer is always right--and as evidenced by some of the businesses responses to other Yelp-ers, they'll continue to make excuses for poor customer service.

I've been to Salut regularly (15+ times) since they opened last year. Overall, it's a great addition to Tempe and I really enjoy it. The atmosphere is really casual and nice, the patio has large booths, overhead string lighting and lots of plants -- also, dog friendly!   The food is overall good -- I've been for brunch, lunch, and dinner. The lunch/dinner food is much better than the brunch food. The hummus nachos are GREAT, and their butcher board is pretty good as well. I usually go with a Sun Devil Turkey Burger with a greek salad-- which is always solid. I've also had the Pistachio crusted salmon, which is also really great. Both the Lavender-Lemon Fizz and the Basil Grapefruit Martini are delicious!   The reason Salut gets 4 stars from me instead of 5 is the brunch, which leaves something to be desired. The food is just overpriced for the quality and portion size. My boyfriend ordered Cinnamon Toast Crunch Chicken & Waffles (which sounds YUM right?) and it came out with just two small pieces of chicken and one waffle. I ordered an omelet with quinoa and veggies with a side of fruit, and I definitely wasn't full. It tastes good, but just a bit too pricey for the quantity of food.

A group of colleagues does lunch out every Friday, and this was the selected spot a few weeks ago. There are 8 of us with quite varied taste buds, so it can be difficult to please us all -- but the Phoenix Public Market Caf√© delivered.   I got a burger, which was fantastic, and other members of our group also raved about their soup, breakfast options, and salads.  BUT - the one thing you cannot leave here without is one of their homemade pop-tarts. Yes, you read right. Homemade pop tarts.  Flaky, crispy, golden pastry layers filled with fruit and topped with perfectly sweet icing. Perfection.

Jayd is SO sweet & professional, and my tan came out wonderfully. She even sent me a text a couple days later to make sure my tan turned out well. A great place I will definitely return to!
