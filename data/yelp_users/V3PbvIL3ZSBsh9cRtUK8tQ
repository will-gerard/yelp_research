Loooove this pizza. Buffalo chicken pizza is my favorite. I usually do carry out because I live  right down the street and they've never took more than 20 minutes to have my order ready. Online ordering is easy to use too.

I've never been so frustrated or disappointed in a company before.  Even though they were priced slightly higher than the other companies we interviewed, we chose California Pools based on all of their stellar reviews and the promise that we would have a project manager guide us through the entire process and make sure everything stayed on track. What a mistake! We signed our contract Feb. 5 and were told to expect our dream pool which was, "no offense, a VERY basic pool project" (exact words used numerous times by our sales guy/project manager))  to be completed by the end of April.  Well, here were are, June 29 and our basic play pool is still not finished!  Our project manager did not return any our phone calls or contact us in any way since we put down our deposit, our scheduling manager is terrible and never knows what is going on - I'm pretty sure she doesn't care either.  It's embarrassing - their sign has been in front of our house for so long that we have neighbors come by and ask "what's taking so long? I thought California pools was a reputable company. I'm pretty glad we didn't use them for our pool!" P.S. Their pools have all been finished for months even though they began construction after us and have nearly identical projects.  It's pretty clear that our project is not a priority to California Pools and that they don't value us as their customers.  I definitely wish we would have given a different company our business.

I finally tried this place and omg why did I wait so long!? We called in a take out order and I'm glad we did because the restaurant itself seems kind of odd. 50s diner, no music random stuff thrown into booths. Anyway, the food was amaaaaaazing. We got the saganaki - fried cheese served with bread, gyros and a salad. Way too much food. We ended up saving the salad for another meal. The gyros are huge and delicious. Saganaki was amazing as well. I will be back!!

Usually I'm all about Chipotle, but this location isn't very good. They are insanely stingy. I asked for more chicken because there were like 4 little cubes of it in my burrito and they tried to charge me for double meat. Really? I've been to this one at least 4 times and each time the employees have been rude. The parking lot also sucks. This is the closest location for me to go to, but I may have to make the trip to a different one from now on.

I'm not sure how I found this place, but I'm glad I did! It is beautiful and quiet. It's the perfect place to take a walk on a cool afternoon. It's also a great place to take family, engagement, graduation photos.

Best sushi I've found in gilbert, I just wish the atmosphere was better. They have these fried jalape√±os stuffed with ahi (I think) that are amazing. It does seem a bit expensive, but then again I always order waaaay too much. They also do take out which I find to be the better choice.

Desert horizon installed our irrigation and a bunch of plants for us. We had one of their sales people come out to our house to give us ideas. He was fantastic. I've honestly never met anyone who loved their job so much.   Once we decided what we wanted to do, we went to the nursery and actually got to pick out trees and shrubs. The nursery is so cute. There is so much to choose from and everyone is so, so friendly.   We still have more work to do in our backyard and plan to have Desert Horizon help us.

Ate here for the first time a couple nights ago and was very pleased. I had the filet which was cooked perfectly. The salad with honey mustard was also delicious. The service was a bit slow, which is why I'm only giving them 4 stars.  It's priced well for a steak house - I'll definitely done here again.

I love the terriyaki chicken bowl (small)   I can't get enough of the sauce. It's so good! Their sushi rolls are also really good. The atmosphere is just so - so. They are usually pretty fast at getting your food out. I like to go here when I'm short on time for lunch. Ask them for a punch card. After 10 purchases you get a free bowl.

Love four peaks beer so much. I wish this location was open more than just Friday night. I used to come here all the time when they'd have. Food truck during the week. Hoping that will come back sometime soon.

After months of thinking "drive - thru salad? No thanks!" I decided to give salad and go a try. I had the mixed greens with Apple wrap with chicken. It was amazing.so many flavors that I wouldn't think to mix, but they're awesome together. That salad is all I want to eat now! My friend got the Greek salad and that was delicious too. Everything tastes very fresh too. I see myself picking up lunch or dinner here a lot from now on.

Probably my favorite place in Gilbert. $5 pitchers of awesome beer during the day every day! Their carne asada is ridiculous. I usually get the beast burrito or a carne asada quesadilla, but everything I've ever had was amazing. Great service too!

I am obsessed with this place. I would eat every meal here if I could. My favorites are the mixed greens with apple and the Greek wrap. Their lemonade is also delicious as are their smoothies. (Super filling too)  I don't really care for the chicken they use, so I get it without - no big deal though. Even when the drive thru line is long, it moves pretty quickly.

At first my thoughts were "really? Another Mexican restaurant in downtown Gilbert??" But, this one is completely different than the others! I love the atmosphere!  Happy hour prices are great. We had the carnitas with green chile appetizer and it was amazing. My husband had some kind of brisket burrito which was huge and very tasty. I had tacos - they were just ok. I don't like that you have to ask for chips and salsa. Regular menu prices are a bit high I think.

I've been to a couple other barros locations and this one is way better than the others. The service is good, pizza is great and this one has a decent beer selection too.
