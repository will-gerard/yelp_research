Great food, and good service. Ordered a chicken chimichanga and was tasty. Chips were served hot, salsa had a good flavor. I mixed the 2 served. Finished off with fried ice cream and was delicious. Cute atmosphere & front window opens to patio to enjoy Arizona's nice fall weather.  Prices are reasonable as well. The only reason I didn't rate a 5 was due to my chimichanga not being as crispy as I am use to. Still very good.

Was like any other typical bbq place. Unsure why there was so much hype. Service was slow. Food was tepid.

Great hole in the wall place. They take their time and do great work. There are only 2 ladies who work there so anticipate a wait. I will definitely be going back.

Hung out here for Happy hour with some of my cousins and a friend.  The food was DELICIOUS! Our first waitress was very nice and provided great service! We started off on the main side of the bar.  After eating we ventured to the room with the pool tables.  We flagged down a waitress by the name of Karissa to order.  Karissa was extremely rude the whole evening.  I am not sure if she was having an off night but she answered our questions with smart a*! answers, kept rolling her eyes and when my cousin asked her for a bacardi and diet tall with a lime she told him he could order it at the bar.(I was like Wow! Really?!) Unsure why she was so snippy with us. We only ordered a few rounds from her and were never rude in anyway to her.  We complained to the manager who our friend knew and he said he would make sure it was dealt with.  He must have talked to Karissa because after that she wouldn't serve us. The manager also told our friend our complaint was not the only one of the evening about her.  Another smiling friendly waitress replaced her.This waitress was super sweet.  I think this place is a lot of fun and seems like they typically have great service. Just beware if you get Karrissa as your server hopefully she will be in a better mood if she serves you. :/

Food is delicious and authentic. My favorites are the salt & pepper shrimp, and of course the seafood tofu soup. The owner Henry is very nice and his team provide great customer service. Wong's is a small hole in the wall restaurant worth checking out.

Had breakfast here Sunday. It was such a great experience. Everyone was happy, and smiley. The food was great, and not pricey. They have very cute concepts such as the muffin baskets, and "kisses" they give you with your bill. Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for great food and a happy atmosphere.

FANTASTIC service especially when Jarred is your bartender. He is always happy, helpful, and fun! I typically do happy hour here on Friday's and have never ordered anything there that was not delicious. My favorites are the pork verde mac and cheese, and the creme brulee. My drink of choice is the sangria's. I definitely would recommend Ticoz to anyone looking for good food, amazing service, and a cozy atmosphere.  TIP: If you register your credit card you use on Groupon and pay with it at Ticoz it will keep track of what you spend and after $150 in purchases you receive a $20 credit. (Again they are great!)

Ordered dinner the other night because I was too lazy to cook. Ordered nachos no beans. When I got home I discovered it only had beans, being too lazy to go back I called. I figured they would replace the nachos the next time I was there. I spoke with Jody(manager) she was very pleasant. She said the next time I visited she would take care of it. I went back today and Jody went above & beyond to make sure I was taken care of. The team was also very sweet. Thank you Jody for making sure I was a satisfied customer .

Recently hired A Wise Move to move from one house to another. They were early to arrive, very nice and did a wonderful job. Pricing was fair for 3.5 hours $292.00. They also reassembled all our items and moved things from one room to another as I decided where they should go. All of my possessions arrived in perfect condition. I highly recommend this company for fast, efficient and great customer service for anyone needing to relocate.

Worst pharmacy ever!!!!!!!!! I have thought they would improve but was wrong. They mislabel prescriptions, and are incompetent . Go elsewhere .

This store reminds me of a used car dealership. The sales rep was nice but when we decide to continue to shop around we got hit with a major hard sell. We ended up finding a great mattress identical to the one we saw here at another store for almost half the price. Would suggest to shop around prior to purchasing here.

Visited this restaurant for brunch. We sat on the patio and had a mimosa & Bloody Mary before ordering. The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars was due to the amount given for the mimosa. I felt shorted. Other then that service was great, and very attentive. The waitress had wonderful recommendations since I was undecided on what to order. I ended up ordering the fried egg sandwich with fries. It was amazing! The roasted red peppers made the sandwich. Others with me ordered the pancake (A must order!) and egg Benedict  with procietto which was also yum! We sat and talked at our table for a while and were not rushed away. The complimentary valet was also a nice touch. Will be visiting this place again but next time for happy hour.

Ordered the chicken gyro and my boyfriend ordered an original one. Must say I am not typically a Gyro person but really enjoyed my food. Tasted the original Gyro and it was great.  Everything was fresh and seasoned very well. The french fries were fantastic ans the greek salad delicious. Highly recommend this place! P.S. Don't expect top notch service.

Had breakfast here and was amazed by the quality of food and service. I had the breakfast croissant which was very large with home potatoes. It was delicious! My husband had steak and eggs and said it was very good.  We also ordered 1 pancake which is the size of a plate and was very tasty. There was a wait but only 15 minutes. The service was fabulous!

Food is okay, but have had it delivered twice now.  The first time I was told an hour delivery time which I understood because there was poor weather.  Instead of an hour it took 2 1/2 hours.  Again, there was poor weather so I didn't make a fuss about it.  I ordered a week later and was told 20 minutes for delivery.  It took 1 1/2 hours to receive the food.  I have ordered house fried rice which is very bland and house lo mein which was tasty bu not worth the wait.  The employees are nice but I will not order from here again due to the wait time and the food being just okay.

If I could give this place zero stars I would! Waited 3 hours for my mother  to be seen. She DID have an appointment. When you are called in you then wait another hour to be seen! The office staff is unprofessional and not helpful. Especially Julie the Supervisor. She is rude, and needs a course in customer service. If you are looking for a doctor steer clear from here.

I have used many Fed Ex printing centers and was highly disappointed in this location. I was having issues with a machine and none of employees offered any assistance. They glanced up and went back to what they were doing. When I asked for help the employee whom I asked seemed to be bothered with me for asking. The only help given was that I was probably doing it wrong. If that's the case then you would think he would come and offer to show me. I eventually figured it out payed extra due to the machine getting stuck and left. I recommend going to the one on Bell Road instead.

Amazing service! My sister in law and I had a manicure & pedicure here (I had gel manicure) and were pleasantly surprised by this hidden gem. The technicians are very friendly, knowledgeable, and talented. The station were extremely clean, the pedicure tubs were lined with plastic and when our pedicures were completed they threw the plastic out then sanitized the tubs and lined with new liners. I appreciated knowing that they go the extra steps to ensure cleanliness. Customer service was fantastic. I highly recommend trying them out.

Called before arriving to see what their holiday hours were. Was told they closed at 5pm.  Arrived at 3:45pm and was turned away because they decided to close earlier I asked, "When was this decided? I just called 20 minutes ago."  Was told they just changed it and sent their techs home. ( BTW there were techs there working on other clients) I felt this was very unprofessional and will not return to this establishment.

Tried this place April 19th. Service was great. Portions not like typical sushi restrurants. Rice in sushi was very dry. Fish not fresh. Service good. Woke up the following morning with food poisioning. I ordered a rainbow roll and seaweed salad. Thinking it was the rainbow roll that caused my illness. It was all I ate all day. Avoid this place for sushi definately not fresh. Contacted manager following day regarding the food poisoning and he was rude and said I definitely didn't get it from their restaurant. I ensured them that I had only eaten there but he got mad and wouldn't listen to me. I wasn't trying to get money back it anything free just wanted to make sure he knew that their fish wasn't fresh. Oh well lesson learned.

I scheduled an appointment to have my teeth cleaned. The office was beautiful, and the team were great. My hygienist was pain free, and quick. Dr. Mark Fleming made me feel comfortable and took the time to answer all of my questions. I am happy to say I have found a new "home" for my dental care needs. I highly recommend this AMAZING office.

An great facility! Seth & Stephen are welcoming and determined to get you the results you are striving for. They keep you accountable by making sure you come in and follow your meal plan. Both are always available for questions and concerns. The other members are like a family and there to help you in anyway possible. I highly recommend TPT to anyone wanting results and a place you enjoy going to each day.

Amazing food, fun atmosphere. I visit Vegas often and each visit I make sure to eat at Boiling  Crab. I enjoy their gumbo, shrimp, sausage, cajun fries, sweet potato fries, chicken wings, crab and shrimp.  Their sauces are tasty and always good quality.  I recommend Boiling Crab to anyone visiting California or Vegas. You will not be disappointed.

Nail salon was very cute and clean however my nail tech was rough and my gel manicure has bubbles. My pedicure looks decent but messy and  nails filed slanted not even. The front desk team were very friendly and so were a few of the nail techs but I probably will not return due to not be happy with my manicure or pedicure.

Great customer service! My husband and I went  to have tires put on and were provided with amazing service.  They do not try to sell you products or services you do not need.  I appreciate an honest company.

I adore this place! The employees are always happy, and helpful.  I order the fish tacos with mango salsa and am never disappointed. The fish is seasoned well and the mango salsa is truly amazing! You get 2 per order but they are always filled with tasty fish and yummy salsa. I have ordered the pasta here as well it was good but not as delightful as the tacos. This place gets busy during lunch so recommend going a tad earlier or later to avoid the rush. My coworkers and I eat here at least once a week. If you are in Scottsdale definitely give the fish tacos a try.

A hidden gem. The location is convenient, the salon is adorable, clean and friendly. I have my hair done by Jess Abramo and she is amazing! My hair always looks fantastic when leaving. I look forward to seeing her she is a great person to be around. She also is wonderful with children. Highly recommend Jess & the salon.
