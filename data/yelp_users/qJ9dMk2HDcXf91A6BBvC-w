My first experience there was ok with an older gentleman who helped me find the right corrective shoes for my funky walk. Last time I went back I was helped be Nate, and I won't be returning. I bought a pair of shoes and noticed a sign that said "20% Off all apparel with purchase of full price shoes". Directly below the sign hung some nice socks, so I went to grab some and was informed the discount doesn't apply to socks. That's fine as I'm sure it probably says that in the fine print I didn't bother to read. However, being a Customer Service Quality Specialist by profession, I did jokingly comment that "C'mon... You can't hang the sign directly above the one item it doesn't apply to. " This must have struck a nerve with Nate because he quickly and arrogantly responded with "We can, I will, and we did. " It's interesting to me how much business can actually be lost with just one single irresponsible and inappropriate statement. I will never give my money to them again so long as there's some snooty kid getting a cut and it remains acceptable to respond to customers that way. He did make it a point to mention earlier that he's part of they family which owns the business so he does get commission. My husband, kids, friends will never shop there again either. I wanted to take the shoes back and get a refund, but realized I'd just be wasting my time since they obviously don't care about my $130 anyway. There are plenty of other places to buy running shoes and most of them have lower prices. I can, will, and did decide to take my money elsewhere from now on.

Awesome. I showed up 15 minutes to close. No problem. I was prepared to buy a new tire. The staff immediately told me that wouldn't be necessary because mine could probably just be fixed. 15 minutes and 12$ later,  they have a customer for life. Also checked and aired all my other tires and no labor fee.

Best Mexican food in the neighborhood. My favorite in the entire valley actually. Fresh handmade tortillas. Fresh food. Awesome salsa bar. Friendly staff. A little pricey for a little taco shop but well worth it. The queso fundido and carne asada are must haves!

I'm a foodie. I love all kinds. Normally I'm not a complainer but this place didn't stand a chance with the obviously low standards the have regarding quality and service. As soon as I walked in I could tell hostess chick was not happy to see me at 30 min till close. I ordered a gyro with greek salad and abaklava.  She told me they don't have greek salad but for additional cost, she can add feta to my regular salad. Say what? "If you love greek food, you have to eat here" or some other such nonsense that is written on the business card. Business cards that have the closing times crossed out and rewritten with sharpie. Super ghetto. Got home. No baklava. Called and she asked if I'd like to come get it or have a credit? Neither. I'd like the difference refunded to my card. The one good thing I can say is that they didn't argue and promptly refunded $4.12 to my card next morning. The meat inside the gyro (I bs you not) is like paper thin uniform pre cut deli slices a and my gyro was dripping grease. I ended up just taking a Caesar side salad btw. The gyro was super gross and I was honestly awakened at 2am by nausea and spent the next hour in the bathroom. I feel bad for anyone who goes there regularly. Maybe you don't know better but if you wanna see the difference for yourself, go have real, authentic, fresh, deliciousness at Athens Gyros right f down the street.

Only the greatest gym in the world. This is where I can work out, tan, get my hair done, buy my supplements at rock bottom prices, attend a yoga class, drop off my dry cleaning, buy top of the line scented candles, make a Christmas charity donation, get a massage and my eyebrows waxed now. Allllll with the friendliest, most helpful and tolerant staff I've ever seen anywhere. What the hell else could you possibly ask for? Very reasonable membership prices without any contract drama? Great hours? Spotlessly clean environment? Plenty of equipment that's not constantly taken over by excess members? The great feeling that comes from knowing you're supporting a local business run by amazing people who deserve and appreciate your business? Check, check, check, check and check! I made the mistake of joining Gold's Gym and 24 hr Fitness. I learned my lesson. I started coming here just to tan a few years back and they've now won over my whole family forever. What we need is a group package! There are tons of trainers around which I personally want nothing to do with, but they're all nice and don't bother us in any way. There's never any pressure of sales or nickle and diming. It feels like we know everyone there and they know us right back. I know the place is moving soon and we just pray they stay close, because we would be traumatized to have to go elsewhere. We love you guys!

Absolutely worst customer service I've ever experienced. I've been overcharged for a year and every time I call to fix it (at least 3 times I can remember) they just leave me on hold or transfer me to the wrong department. I hate them with a passion. I'm finally canceling and taking my chances with a small, local, company. I would always recommend avoiding sparklettes aka opremiumwater at all costs! Run, run away!!

Impressive. I'm really into food. And I love fresh healthy delicious food that provides an experience. Right away, walking in this place feels like visiting family. The menu is simple and the owner himself welcomes you with this big, real, friendly personality that is super refreshing. You can see the whole kitchen and the meat is sliced fresh. You can watch if you like. Nothing is hidden. I bet this guy would tour you through the whole back of house if you wanted. It's obvious he takes great pride in his place and he should. The gryos are amazing. Everything from the homemade tziki and freshly sliced meat. The Greek salad is $1 up charge and well worth it. baklava is homemade and so delicious. It sells out though so don't wait until next time to get it! I absolutely LOVE this place and this food and contributing to this local gems long term success. GO there. Don't order delivery. Enjoy the whole experience.

They bring us samples often and I always love them, so I decided to order today. ordered a veggie sandwich with alfalfa sprouts on it and it came about 20 min later. They asked me if I wanted it cut in half. ..yes please. Open the sandwich. ..no sprouts, not cut in half, I couldn't even find the avocado at first but eventually did. Not enough to be able to taste it. So I called and the manager said they'll send me another sandwich but to make sure I return the one they messed up. So. ...I'm supposed to spend my entire 30 minute lunch waiting for a seconds sandwich and you want the messed up one bank so you can throw it away? I even had to go get the menu and read it to him the description. He said it must be an old menu. I guess it wouldn't be so bad but it was trashy to all for the other sandwich back or not offer a credit instead knowing I only had 30 minutes for lunch. I won't order again. I don't know if he thought I was lying or is just short on sandwiches, but I don't have time for this

Great quality for fast food and great staff. I'm only giving 4 stars because I frequently see advertisements for the circus here which I don't support.

This place has come a long way in the last couple years. The volunteers and staff have so much on their plate and sometimes you can see the emotional exhaustion in their faces, but they do their best to be helpful and compassionate. The live release rate here is the highest open intake in the state as anywhere from 70 to 90 percent of their animals walk out alive every month. That's really good considering they take in so many bite animals and elderly or sick animals abandoned by their owners. I think any reviews made based on phone calls or judgements are irrelevant. If you haven't actually walked into one of the shelters for a service, you shouldn't be writing a review. Yes, please be advised that it is common for animals adopted from here to come with a cold. It's a homeless shelter. If you can't afford a vet visit and some antibiotics, you shouldn't be taking on a pet. I've had great experiences here and I go with a well educated expectation rather than regurgitated propaganda. Keep up the good work guys!

There's a reason this place has a solid 5 star review. I shopped around as my s5 stopped working and the screen wouldn't come on but wasn't shattered. I was disappointed when the phone cpr place barely looked at it, then told me it needed a whole new screen. I was completely distrustful. I called around and a friend from Facebook recommended this place. Sam was the guy there when I went in and he offered to open it up and verify the problem and then he actually showed me the issue and quoted me $40 less than the other guys. They were generous with offering me a discount for a white screen when the black one didn't work. I ended up paying $60 less than the other place quoted and that included a brand new high end tempered glass screen protector. I'm extremely happy. They have my business and all my referrals for life!
