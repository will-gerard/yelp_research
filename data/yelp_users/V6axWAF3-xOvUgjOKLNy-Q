I've been a member of this gym for years and no  matter how many times I asked they will not bring in enough 45 pound plates.  it's like going on an Easter egg hunt just to find a few plates to do a workout

Don't even consider the skillet queso! I guess my Spanish is rusty,  but i thought queso is cheese.  I am pretty sure there is no cheese in this dish.  It tastes like watered down chili.

My favorite tire place. I picked Discount tire at first because of the name. However, I keep coming back because they act like they really care. They might be faking it, but I believe it. The prices are good, but above that I've been in a bind a few times and they have really hooked me up with a better deal. Then if you need a tire balance or a flat fixed it.s included.

The calamari was very good and my veel Marsalis was extremity good.  It pays to call ahead.  They don't take reservations, so calling ahead is the next best option.

I always like their steaks here. The sampler platter is good and their food is consistant. We have always had good service.  They are easily better than outback steak house.

My wife and I eat out a lot and she chose this place tonight. It has a ton of reviews on Yelp and Google so it worked for me. When we got there they said an hour wait, which normally means I turn around and find somewhere else. But I couldn't talk the wife out of it this time. So, we finally got our table and by this time I'll eat anything. The wait staff was attentive and had good timing. They have a large selection of beers and wines as indicated by the name. I ordered Boneless Ribyeye steak and she ordered the seafood sample plate. I was very impressed with the quality of a steak especially since this place seems to be pizza and beer at first glance. I also tried my wife's shrimp and scallops and they are also top notch. I am very pleased with the quality and the experience in general.

I moved my prescription over to frys recently and the pharmacist Jenenah was extremely patient and helpful.  She went out of her way to explain how to give myself an injection so that it didn't hurt as much.  I really appreciated the extra time she spent to help me

No matter how many times I ask, they refuse to get more 45lb plates. If anyone is working their legs it is nearly impossible to find enough free weights to do my workout.  How hard could it be to get 30 more plays?  They also run out of paper towels all the time.

Although the food is the same at all these locations,  the staff here is far more friendly than any other location I've been to.  They remember my name and my usual preferences all the time.  The food is always good and I can't find a better jalapeño cream cheese anywhere.

#44 is awesome.  I come here for that every time.  It is s metal bowl with rice around the inside and cooked to be crispy.  Then they add a stir fry meat and veg on top of that.  If is very good. I think the thing that makes it better than most is the sauce. I would normally call it a white sauce similar to Moo Goo Gi Pan, but it is lighter than that. I'm not sure what the 68 means but I'm guessing it's because it's not as good as 69

I go to unPhogettable all the time because I always order the Pho, but more than that. The summer rolls are better than any other place I've been!  I always get this one. A2 Nem NÜ§ng Cun (2 Soft SUMMER Rolls)（越式米纸烤豬肉捲） $4.95 (Fresh rice paper rolls with Vietnamese pork sausage served with house special sauce). It's not hard to find good Pho, but these things are worth the trip alone for me.

Well you wouldn't think that Applebee's deserves 5 stars but what I ordered actually does. the chicken wings were done perfectly and the hot sauce on them was pretty decent. pretzels were good and the chicken dish I ordered was perfect. Our server was exceptional as well.

This is a good place for breakfast. I enjoyed the Eggs Benedict. I only gave it a 4 because I've had better, but it was good enough.  The wait staff was very good and the food came out fast.  I'm sure that was because it was not busy at all.

Here is my experience with LHM Nissan. We went in on a Sunday and they showed us around.  We found a car we liked and they didn't seem to be able to meet our requirements for a deal. So after working us over for an hour, they finally brought out the "big guns", Cassidy!!!!   He offered deal after deal, which we turned down. Then he finally arrived at the deal that we "could not turn down". So we drove off in our new to us car and left our old car behind.  After a week, we had not heard anything so we stopped by to see what was up. Then Cassidy said they could not find a financing option for the deal he proposed and we all signed, so he wanted his car back.  OK,  how can you come up with a deal and then after 1 week decide that it just isn't going to work and then ask for the car back!!!  WTF!  The dealership should know what is going to fly or not.  Don't  put a deal on the table and then change your mind.  I realize that this is not totally uncommon for a dealership,  but I would only expect crap like this from some low life shady dealership in downtown Phoenix.

I found AZ NativeScapes on Angie's List and with all of their outstanding reviews, it was an easy choice to call them to redo my backyard. The owner, Craig, happened to be in my neighborhood that day, so he came over after finishing another yard to give me an estimate. I told him what I wanted to have done and he didn't run away, so that was another good sign. He told me things that would work in this climate and which things wouldn't. He also told me which parts I could save money on if I wanted. He literally painted a visual on the ground of the new yard layout. It was about an hour of us discussing my dream backyard and then he gave me a price and date within a few minutes. It was easy to say YES! I gave him half of the cost down and paid the second half when it was done. They started about a week later. Have you ever seen Yard Crashers on HGTV? They came in, they demolished and they created the yard of my dreams! It was an exciting 3 days at my house, and now every day after work, I love sitting on my patio and having some bbq. AZ NativeScapes really is the BEST!

In the past I had always shopped for price when looking for insurance companies and after having some really bad experiences with getting my claims taken care of I decided that it would be in my and my families best interest to raise my sites to a more established company like state farm. Mark was recommended to me by a friend and he has been my agent for several years now.   Mark believes in building relationships with his customers.  Always willing to take the time to  Talk with me and continues to follow through with what he needs to do.  I have moved all of my policies  To Mark and the first thing that he did was to go through a complete review of the policies, the coverages and truly explained all of the features of the policies and the discounts.  This was really helpful to me and after sitting with Mark, I was able to even save a little money with some added discounts that he was able to add to my policies.  If you are looking for an Insurance Agent that always has your best interest at heart, then you should Give Mark Slepak at call.  Mark will even come out to your home and go over all of your stuff.  He brings his laptop and internet hot spot and is able to make changes and have all of the policy information handy.  All in all......I feel really good about my agent....I hated to leave my old agent, but know that Mark Is there to taking care of me.

My wife and I go to Osaka about 3 times a year and the "show" they put on is usually identical from one visit to the next. The food is normally just ok. Tonight we must have had a new guy because the "show" lacked most of the elements that it normally had and he was not as proficient with his tools, however, he was the best chef we have ever had there. Every bit of the food was the best I've ever had there. I can only assume that all the other cooks where focusing to much on the show and not on the food.  I was very happy because I don't really care about the show. I only go there because my wife likes it. Tonight the food was the best I've ever had there. I had the lobster and the filet Mignon. It was very good.

My wife and I went to High Tide for the first time last night. I read a bunch of Yelp reviews recommending several things so we decided to give it a try. The calamari was in long fried strips and tasted as good as any other I've had at other places. No better no worse. The fresh oysters were as good as it gets if you are not in a restaurant closer to the ocean. However, the thing that made my night was the Gumbo. OMG!  I'm not saying it's the best I've ever had, but it is the best I have had in the last 25 years. The only thing closer was in Louisiana. I am extremely happy with that all by itself. The atmosphere and the wait staff where very good as well.

My wife and I decided to go to Dubina Brewing last night for our anniversary. I'm a big fan of good beer and we had never tried this place. The reviews looked promising, however the experience was one of the worst I've ever had. When we arrived we sat at the bar and brought our Groupon out.  After learning the available beers, we got our flights and then the bartender vanished for over 20 minutes.   We ordered some food. The pretzel came out fairly quickly, however the bratwurst never made it. At times, we looked around the dinning room floor in hopes of finding our server and did not see a single staff member anywhere. At other times the bartender walked right by us without even a glance our way.   After 50 minutes we left without our food to find another place to eat dinner.   The only good thing I can say about this place is that the pretzels where ok.   Obviously, we will never be going back to this establishment again.

I was initially a little hesitant about going here because of some bad reviews. However after getting my food I was happy to see how much there was and after eating it I was very happy with how well the chicken was cooked and the vegetables were cooked properly as well.  I would recommend this anybody. I only gave it 4 stars because I've had better. But it was still good.

I'm not filipino, but I like the food and this place does a really good job with the food.  They don't have any pictures of the food and they take a long time to prepare it.  But if you want good filipino food with good service, is s good place to go.
