I LOVE THIS ACE! I will avoid Lowes and Home Depot if I can help it from here on out. The staff goes above and beyond! I went to Lowes twice to try and get the same key cut. One trip to Ace and Jimmy got it right the first time! He also helped me with a more cost effect fix for my toilet after the part I was sold at Lowes also did not work. They've got a loyal customer here!

Just purchased my Christmas tree there yesterday. The guys who helped us out went above and beyond!  Even went so far as to shave down the trunk of the tree with a chainsaw so it would better fit our tree stand. We will be back!

Not as good as it once was... A few years ago when Pink Polish first opened I was blown away by the quality of product and service provided. Not to mention skill of the techs. I went only to PP for two years straight and recruited all my girlfriends as well. We even had a bridal shower there and it was extremely well done. However I moved away for a few years and just recently returned.  I was so excited to go back and was thrilled to find out my favorite tech still worked there!  Unfortunately though I left horribly disappointed.  The prices have gone up. Expected. But the quality of product has gone significantly down. The over all atmosphere looks inviting until you overhear the techs and management talk behind each others backs. I did try and go back 2 more times and found myself equally as disappointed. Long story short I found a new nail salon.

Since March of this year I have been on the great hunt for a nail salon that has quality product & skilled techs. FINALLY I found the place!!! I got a plain pink and white acrylic backfill and it's perfect! I was warmly greeted by a very pleasant gentleman (who I later learned was Larry) and was luck enough to get Kate as my tech without an appointment (which I found out later was pretty lucky on my part). They have legit quality product and the place smells like a spa not a nail salon. I am so thrilled my search is over! As long as they're in business I will be a customer!

I seriously don't understand the poor reviews! I've now been back for another backfill and pedicure. EVERYONE is GREAT! The service is excellent! Just had to give another shout out! This is my forever nail place!

I just can't believe the experience myself and co-workers just had. We decided this place would be a great choice because they offer online ordering! We all only had our individual debit cards so how convenient, right!? NOT!!! First of all when I arrived to pick up our orders they acted like they had never received an online order. OK I though, maybe it is a new system for them so no big deal... Ha!  It took 3 people to figure the orders out. They wanted me to pay for what had already been paid for. It took a good 10-15 minutes for everything to get straightened out. I checked the tickets for accuracy before I left with the food. Ok good to go. Wrong again! ALL of the food was incorrect! They forgot the meat on a Carne Asada Quesadilla. Forgot the cheese that was clearly marked and paid extra for on tacos. Forgot guacamole on everything. Not to mention they don't have sour cream in the first place. Holy crap, never again!

Upon trying to find a new nail salon I stumbled upon Glamour Nail Bar due to its close proximity to Ross which I can't get enough of. I saw their sign for a $15 express pedicure and went in with my sister for a trial run. They sat us right away and were very pleasant and professional. The salon was noticeably clean and organized as well.  Neither of our nail techs were much for small talk which is perfectly fine with me and actually much appreciated. I'd honestly rather close my eyes and relax anyway. Due to the extremely reasonable prices I also decided to get a backfill which I was pleased with as well. So all and all I enjoyed my experience and plan on going back.

I regret to inform you that the prices are reasonable for a reason. It hasn't even been a full two weeks and my nails and toes both look pretty awful. The techs did a good job but the product is not very good or it would have lasted... On to try out the next nail salon... Ugh

I recently used Gus's for a catering order to my office for a training lunch. From the girl I called to place the order with, to the delivery guy, to the quality and quantity of the food, to the price, I was very pleased! I will definitely use them again and they have become an office favorite. People are already asking when I'll bring Gus's back again. DELICIOUS!
