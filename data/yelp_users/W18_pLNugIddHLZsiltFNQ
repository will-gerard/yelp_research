If I could give this sad company negative stars I would.  Not only are they scammers they tried to threaten me fro them not performing services they said they would.  I'd honestly rather throw money away and do the yard work myself then to give this company one penny.   TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND TERRIBLE SERVICES.  -3 STARS

Great customer service,  was greeted promptly without being over pressured.  Cesar answered all my questions and got me a fantastic rate on my new RZR!  The process was simple, quick, and painless.  I would recommend this place to any of my friends and family and ALL other dealerships should take notes on professionalism and experience.  Thank you RideNow Chandler and Cesar!!
