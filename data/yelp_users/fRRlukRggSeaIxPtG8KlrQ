I had an excellent experience here. Dr. Paulin was very thorough and friendly. The customer service gentleman Sam  was very helpful, he helped me pick out glasses and the best deal to save me money.  My glasses were ready in an hour.

I have been going here for like 10 years and have never had a bad experience.  I see dr. Barb and she is very caring and you can tell she loves helping make you feel better.  The receptionists are always very nice and helpful.

i have not been a huge fan of charlies for a while....for some reason it always smells like vomit....about 8 months ago my car was broken into they stole a purse out of the front floor board, the funny thing is they had police walking the parking lot...fast forward to now march 6th 2011 had another car broken into this time they stole a caboodle which had make up in it and a rhinestoned mask...when we went inside and asked them to call the police, they said they couldn't and gave us the number to do it ourselves. great customer service...i think not!!!  then we were out side and the bar manager came out and said they have video of the whole parking lot and we can get a copy of it great!!! oh but but we have to wait till thursday...now i hate the bar even more.

If I could give this place a zero I would!  A few friends and I were walking Fremont st going in and out of casinos gambling, we went in here and they would not let my gay friend in because he was wearing make up.  Security said it was a costume....they also would not let our other friend in because she was with him...I walked in and spoke to a manager he came back and said it was a costume because it was a lot of make up...no other Casino on Fremont has had a problem....when I told the manager there were people in here with just as much make up on he said no they would make them wipe it off

I stopped here to get gas after my partners show.  My partner went in to use the bathroom as he had many times before, the cashier told him "we don't have a bathroom for you"...obviously the cashier is homophobic and I would suggest that u not give this circle k your business. I will be calling his manager and corprate in the morning

Sorry to say the customer service was awful.  A few friends and I went to have a good time first we stopped at the bar where set sat for a good 15 mins before someone took our order then waited another 10 to get out drinks and it wasn't busy.  Then we paid 17.95 for unlimited bowl and laser tag.  The waiter/waitresses we had were not up to par by a long shot.  No one ever came to us we had to go to them.  The first waiter we had asked for a drink brought it out in a timely manner, after that it went down hill he never came back we had to talk to another "waitress" who took for ever to bring two beers then when she finally decided to bring them to is we asked for a lemonade and another beverage she brought one not in a timely manner and "forgot" the lemonade.  Had to go add more time to bowl where we told the lady helping us that that the service was not up to par then a manager came over tried to make it right I applaud her effort right after that our lane broke and I asked them to fix it no one came waited like 10 mins then we were all over it  all in all fun place but don't expect any type of customer service.
