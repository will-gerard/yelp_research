When I'm feeling low and looking for a great atmosphere to cheer me this is where I go! Great drinks and the staff is so very nice. Throw a little karaoke in for fun and this is most definetly the place to be.

I am putting a disclaimer on this review by telling you up front... I am a regular. There is a good reason I'm a regular though.The bartenders are awsome and really friendly. The drinks are priced well and the owner has a house beer that is really tastey and even cheaper than the regular beers. The karaeoke host is so nice. Terry (evil T, papa T, etc.) is one of the main reasons I started frequenting this place. There is a huge selection of music. Even if you don't see it in the books, a lot of times if you ask he can find it. Don't be surprised if you get a nickname from him on your first time up. This is a great hole in the wall/dive bar.

Good food at a good price. I've only done take out, but the service we did get was good. Their black bean beef was excellent!

I have been going here for years and have always really enjoyed myself! The fish is good and is on bar with the overpriced places in Scottsdale without the price tag. I was a little wary of the All-You-Can-Eat, but its a fair deal if you can eat a lot of sushi. I found the best trick is to order in rounds otherwise your eyes can be bigger than your stomach

This is my friend's favorite sushi place because they will make her sushi with just plain rice(not sushi rice). I tend to be a bit more of a traditional sushi lover so even though their roll list is impressive, the quality leaves something to be desired. I am not a huge fan but I have had worse. The fish is mediocre and only worth the price they are asking for when they run their happy hour. The drinks make the trip though. So if you are looking to have some drinks and a little sushi on the side, this would be a good place to go.

Let me start by saying my requirement for any place that calls itself an Irish pub is that they carry Strongbow or Harp. Most places I go have one or the other (mostley just a lot of Harp). They not only had both, but the Strongbow was on tap.*drool*  I went out to dinner here first. Then hit it up later as a bar. The food is fantastic! The old world and new world menus are a great way to make sure that everyone in your party can be happy.

I have been here several times and they have never gotten my order right. I have never actually had something there that was cooked the way I ordered it. They even forgot the salad I ordered one time until the waitress brought the check. The last time I went my husband and I both got sick off the food. The atmosphere is fun, but that's about all it has going for it.

I love hole in the wall places. This place was so hole in the wall we drove by it twice not realizing it was actually in the industrial park part. I was craving some bagle and lox and this place was closer than driving to Chompies at Paradise Valley Mall. Even though they were out of lox (apparently someone had walked in just after they opend and ordered 13) I did get the BLT on aseago with cream cheese. These are the best bagels I have ever eaten, Hands Down!. I look forward to going back for some lox!

Went here for a Girls Night Out with four others. The appitizers were very good and the champegne selection was fantastic. I'm not really one for the Scottsdale club scene, but it wasn't that bad. The highlight of the night was the chocolate fondue plate.  Amazing chocolate and the peanut butter whip cream was to die for. The dj was good and we had a great time. Not a bad way to spend a Friday night!

I have learned the secret to this place is to sit at the sushi bar if you can. My friend told me about this place and went on about the fact that the sushi chefs just kept handing him different things to try (none of which appeared on his bill). So I went and was impressed by their selection. They literally have at least 50 rolls (one for every state). We sat at the bar and had a good time. The chef indeed handed us a couple of things to try, the most interesting being the battered and fried salmon skin. All in it was good!
