Stopped in last night for a take out dinner. I wanted to bring home something different than burgers or a pizza or fried chicken. So I used my Yelp app.... And showed Yusefs nearby with good reviews.  The owner was a very personable person....and very helpful. Everything smelled wonderful, and it was pretty busy....all good signs.  I order 2 of the falafel dinner plates, and the stuffed grape leaves plate. The only "side" for a dinner plate was the split pea soup. It was a generous portion....and VERY GOOD!  The falafel and grape leave were both generous portions....and delicious!  I want to go back a do a little grocery shopping for some of the unique items that I think you could find only in Phoenix here.  Good job Yusef! I liked it!

Sky Harbor Airport has the coolest dog walking area I have ever seen! It has a small doggie drinking fountain... its shaded... and it even has a FIRE HYDRANT!   I think I will take it upon myself to visit every airport in the country and review the pet sanitary situation! :)  I am sure there is a website idea in there somewhere.

It has been interesting seeing Sky Harbor airport grow over the years.... And there is a new airport train, and a new parking garage still being built.... Which adds to a little of the chaos trying to get around. Particularly on the weekend, when construction is in full swing.  Ideally, if you fly out of Terminal 2 or Terminal 3 they are usually less crowded (shorter lines) than Terminal 4.

Good Starbucks. Friendly staff. Very clean. Pastry case filled.  My drink came quick and correct.   Only comment is that it's a fairly small store with all small tables. So larger groups cannot sit together.

We had to travel from Florida to Scottsdale to get good Jewish deli style food. We went on a Saturday morning and it was super busy. We waited about 20 minutes for a table. The parking lot is NUTS!!! Be careful driving around on a weekend.   I had Neal's Deli Trio... big portions, super fresh, very tasty. Coffee delicious.   Of course the desserts are nuts! :)  Bagels are the best you can find in the Phoenix area. I love the veggie cream cheese.   I took one star off because it is so pricey. We spent a small fortune on "brunch".

Yay... for a change what I think about a particular establishment seems to be in the majority... so to keep my review "brief", I will basically say that what all the other reviewers have written is exactly right... for what is essentially a "outlet" store, the prices are crazy high. Selection usually tends to be less than stellar.   One thing that does keep me coming back to Nordstrom Rack is the shoes! They have a great selection of quality shoes, at reasonable prices.   I much rather take my chances at Ross or Marshall's (both right down the street).

All I needed to complete my delicious meal here was a good Cuban cigar and some brandy!  We had the Papa Rellena for an appetizer... very very good. Its a beef filled potato cake with a cilantro lime sauce.  For entrees my wife and I shared two dishes... the Ropa Viejas (shredded beef brisket in a tomato wine sauce) and the Gallina Frita (crispy fried shredded chicken, onions, in a mojo garlic lime sauce....amazing!  Both dishes were large...with tons of meat.  Great service and really good mojitos make for a nice evening out at the Havana Cafe.  For dessert we indulged on the "Best Of Phoenix" (Phoenix New Times) Caramel Flan.... OMG!!!! And the coffee was yummy too!   We also found a 15% coupon in DineInAz.com.... saved us almost $7!  As the sign over the door says... "Cha Cha Cha!"

Be sure to save up for the $3000 coffee machine they demo'd for me! Nuts! I could never imagine paying as much for a coffee machine as I would for a used car!  I am really wanting to take one of the cooking classes they offer here. Soon maybe... Hoping for a Sur Le Table Groupon!

Ray's has great pizza. I was born and raised on Brooklyn... so I think I an say safely that I know what a "Ray's" pizza should be like. And this place is pretty close.   I am NOT a fan of their chicken wings... sorry. I HATE chicken wings that sit on an inch of the wing sauce. I know some people do like it that way... I do not. Redendo's (down the street) has way better (crispy) wings.  Ray's does have a great variety of gourmet style pizza. Most is available in "slice" format. The prices are reasonable... if leaning towards the expensive side.   I like the pizza in the "window"... very reminiscent of my NYC days.

I am a member of Mimi's "email club"... and they frequently send out BOGO (Buy One Get One) deals.   Hilary and I used one last night and had a nice meal.   I had for the very first time the beef bourguignon... and I now have a new favorite!!! I have nothing to compare it to (in terms of if its truly "French" or not), but I really liked my dish. The chuck roast they used was super tender and falling apart with mushrooms. There is a side of mash potatoes, carrots and broccoli.   I added the corn chowder as an appetizer... also yummy.   My wife has a favorite salad she has there... and she was happy with it as well.   I usually play it safe here at Mimi's and almost always get the "turkey dinner", but took a chance last night... and glad I did.   As many reviewers have said... Mimi's is always "decent".   If you have not done it yet... sign up for the email freebies! If you use them, it works out to close to $300 in free meals in a year.

So, my 100th Review is this crap hole.... Cobblestone Auto Spa. Kind of sad really... I was hoping to do a big gala review for something much more more worthwhile.  Oh well.... here it goes....  I have been a long time customer of this place until yesterday! I wish I could give NEGATIVE Stars!  I pulled in mid morning on a Monday... and it must have said "DUMB ASS" on my forehead... 'cause barely had my car door open before the FIRST sleaze bag Window Repair Guy was pouncing. ALL I WANTED WAS FOR MY CAR TO BE WASHED! Nothing More, Nothing Less. I couldn't shake this leach! Finally he left.  Then I had to deal with the "Service Writer Sleaze Bag".... to make a really long and sad experience shorter... I basically had to look this guy in the eyes and actually say "WHAT PART OF 'NO' DID YOU NOT UNDERSTAND???" I had to start getting back in my car and attempt to leave before he gave me my ticket to checkout.   On my way to the cashier.... from the shadows.... a Sleaze Bag Selling Monthly Wash Packages leached onto me... After a few awesome ninja moves.... I got rid of him.   Then as I am next to pay my tab at the register... SECOND sleaze bag Window Repair Guy was pounced from outside... he literally RAN in the store to chase me down. I used my best Jedi Mind Trick to dissuade him.   I thought I was in the clear... till the Sleazy Cash Register Guy tries to sell me additional packages I have ZERO interest in.   IT WAS SINGLY ONE OF THE WORST "WASH" EXPERIENCES I HAVE EVER HAD... and I have had some bad ones.   I guess I don't get it... I paid $12 to get my car washed... I figure its 10 cents of water (they recycle)... 10 cents in soap. 2 cents for the electricity to wash just my car.  And the labor to wipe it down. Plus the gas and convenience store items. Is business so god awful that they really need to alienate there customer base by using such super high pressure sales tactics.   I ended up stopping at Home Depot across the street and bought a hose and some rags. Gonna do it myself next time.

I have lived here for two and a half years.... and I have very few complaints.   I love that the community is very dog friendly.... there are two dog parks.   There are 4 pools.... each with multiple bar-b-ques for the residents to use. Two work out facilities.  The grounds are kept nice, and the whole complex is generally very quiet.  It's a good place to call home.... very central to shopping and many restaurants. And it has a great "zip code"!

It's a "UPS" store.... you bring in a package... they take it... you wave goodbye to it... you leave.  Sometime after that a big Brown Truck arrives and wisks said package off to its destination.   This UPS Store was unremarkable... the guy behind the counter did his job... nothing more nothing less.

Still one of my favorite brewery's in town with awesome food and beer. I was back for a recent trip, and this was my must stop at place while up in North Scottsdale! I love the beer. And I especially love the "pub food" they serve. In my opinion Four Peaks has some of the best burgers in town. They are HUGE... and reasonably priced for what you get. My favorite is the Jalapeno Popper burger... you gotta try it. The Bavarian pretzel is a must have appetizer. I like sitting outdoors, as the inside can get a little crowded and very noisy at peak times. I do not like sitting upstairs at all.

Great Bagels! For a really long time I would hhave had to say that Chompies was my fav bagel... NO LONGER!  We went middle of a Sunday...and they were out of a few varieties, but what they did have were all very fresh and tasty.  We also took home a few of there blended cream cheese selections... also very good.  Stevie G gives Big City Bagels a big thumbs up!

I really like China Mist! Huge selection... plus accessories if you are into teas.   The best part of working across the street from China Mist is **FREE** Ice Tea all day long! They have a sample bar setup in their lobby, and you can just walk in a help yourself to the few varieties they have setup that day.  You can also purchase teas from the receptionist.   Give them a visit... tell them I sent you.... get FREE tea! :)

Stopped in here for lunch yesterday... and had the pulled pork sandwich with the sole slaw... on an onion roll. Had the baked beans as a side... and of course Sweet Tea!   I loved it. It was so damn good. The meal was about 9 bucks... a little steep in my opinion for a sandwich. The beans were really delicious with little morsels of BBQ beef in it. Unfortunately, I do not get out to this part of town too often, so i do not get to take advantage of all the BBQ goodness Thee Pitts has to offer.   I am glad I get to check off another one of the Dinner, Drivins, and Dives restaurant off my list of must tries!

This is my FAVORITE bakery in the Valley Of The Sun!  Nuff Said!   Unfortunately, I used to live in Surprise, AZ. But my one bright shining star was My Daddy's Bakery! I used to drive right past here for almost 2 years. It's hard to do as this place is tucked into the back of a small strip of stores. Then one day I heard the voices in my head say to turn in... and I was glad I did!  The first thing that caught my attention... and I knew I was in the right spot... was the painting on the window that thanked me for not dieting! :)  This bakery is the closest I have found to what I grew up to in Brooklyn, NY. They have a great selection of really hard to find (in Phoenix) Italian pastry items.   Get there early to get the Italian bread loaves FRESH OUT OF THE OVEN!!! OMG... there is nothing better.   The sandwiches are really good... an reasonably priced. Especially since its on their own homemade bread.   When I was in there the other day, it looks like they now offer Take And Bake Pizza. They looked really good.   In looking over the other reviewers comments... please try to understand one thing (and I am NOT making excuses) but the staff is all from New York... and they tend not to be the most friendliest people in the world. Get over it... and try the product! You will be glad you did!

I had the privilege of attending this past Friday for the Phx Art Museums "First Friday" event. This time is was a floral themed event.... where local floral artists were paired with different pieces throughout the museum.   It was really very wonderful! I had not been to the Phoenix Art Museum for many years (since the Monet Exhibit). And I had the impression that this time it was MUCH BIGGER than I ever remembered it.  I loved the diversity of the art exhibits. My personal favorites are the more modern multimedia type pieces.  There was a live performance art group when I was there... they were awesome... but very odd all at the same time.   I look forward to attending again next month. I would very mch like to make it a routine.

I wish Yelp had a "6th" Star to award restaurants sometimes! I would give one to Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles.... based on my dinner this past Friday night.  First off, we ended up here almost by accident. I made the drive with my wife and daughter on Friday evening from Scottsdale to downtown Phoenix to visit Mrs. White's Golden Rule Cafe.... only to learn they are now closing at 7PM every night! :(   They used to be open till 3am on Friday and Saturday nights.  But... they did inform us that Lo-Lo's was open and it was not too far away... so off we went.   They place was busy... and they sat us towards the back. But the service was crazy good!!!   You really need to spend a few good minutes acquainting yourself with the menu. I was laughing my ass off at the menu items! "Stupid Fries", "Phat Azz Samich", "Crazy Ghetto Mess", "A Jar Of Drank"! Just to name a few.  The best "line" of the night... my wife asks our waiter, "How are the 'stupid fried'?" His reply.... They're Stupid...............(long pause)..... GOOD!"   I stuck with the tried and true chicken and waffles. We shared at the table the candied yams, and the fried okra. Everything was amazing! It was my first time having chicken and waffles together. And it won't be my last. I ate so much I was sick for several hours afterwards, but you can't help yourself!   Dinner on average seems to run about $13 a person.  So when you a re in the "hood", give Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles... you will be glad that you did!

I LOVE THE WAFFLE HOUSE!   Anyplace I can pick what I want to eat off of a "picture menu"... you got me hooked! :)  I love the loaded hash browns, and waffles. Nothing more, nothing else. They usually can't screw that up... so its generally consistent.... and cheap! A plus is the really good coffee.   So... get yur briches on, put yur teeth in... and come on down to da Waffle Houze!

/BEGIN REVIEW/ THE BEST BURGER I HAVE EVER HAD!!!  /END REVIEW/  Nothing more needs to be said.... well worth the money. Well worth the experience.  I had burger combo... which includes "skinny" fries. We also ordered the assorted dipping sauces for an additional $2 bucks (well worth it). I also had an additional side of onion rings.... amazing!   They have a HUGE beer selection, including many on tap. That's in addition to all the custom milkshakes you can conjure up!   Here is my overall take on this place. - It's Vegas! Most good food (especially in a report hotel) costs a few bucks more.  - It's a celebrity chef restaurant. Nuff Said. - The prices are *not* stupid outrageous! I mean... have you ever eaten in a "Five Guys" restaurant?? You spend plenty for those burgers... and the Burger Bar is FAR superior for a few bucks more. - The service was awesome.  I had a great lunch here, and am anxious to come back when I am back in town.

I was here for a corporate event with eBay/Paypal, and they had rented the whole place out. There was a Journey tribute band call "DSB" (Don't Stop Believing) who were very good.   The foods they served (buffet style) was awesome. It was somewhat standard... chicken fingers, pasta, shrimp. There was an open bar, and the drinks were all top shelf.   I had been here before a few times for dinner, and it was very good. The dishes are always large, and the prices (for a resort hotel) are pretty reasonable for what your get. And there is almost always a band... so live entertainment is always a good thing.

What a crap hole of furniture selection! Everything here seems somewhat over priced and most of it seems USED! Not what I was in the market for.   What they do have is just awfully ugly. I could have gone to a swap meet and found nicer stuff.  I was really saddened after walking through it. Ugh!  And as we were leaving, we got to witness a homeless family going through the dumpster in the front of the store.   SO TOTALLY DEPRESSED by the whole experience!

Never come here at the stroke of noon...unless you like to wait in line!   Nothing makes the afternoon like consuming a Double Double Animal Style...and since I do the "low carb" thing... I get it "protein style" (wrapped in lettuce, sans bun).

This place is always busy.... but the line moves fast.  I love the homemade dark rye bread!   I also always order the same thing here.. "The Gobbler"! So yummy! Turkey breast, cream cheese, and cranberry sauce!  The sandwiches are large enough, and reasonably priced with the side you get (cole slaw, mac salad, or potato salad).   They also have a good lunch special... 1/2 sandwich with side for $4.79 plus tax. Not a bad deal.

Ok... lets review this Walgreen. They sell drugs, and cigarettes. All they need to add is sex and rock 'n roll and they would have it all!  :)  I never really understood how a "drug store" (aka a place that one would think is interested in your well being) (they even have a health clinic in this particular location) could sell so much stuff that is really bad for you.    Time to get off my soap box.   I am not a overly big Walgreen's fan. I hate that they do not do the $4 generic prescriptions like many other large pharmacies do.   There also ALWAYS seems to be a long line at this particular location when picking up medication. Nothing like standing in line in front of the "health clinic' full of sick people waiting to be seen by a "health care provider" (aka nurse), waiting to pick up my 3 month supply of Viagra... and a six pack of Walgreen's Brand Beer for $1.99. What can I say... I am a cheap drunk!

My favorite neighborhood grocery store! Great selection of some interesting variation of the foods I like to eat... all at reasonable prices while maintaining high quality.  I also like the fact that these stores are not very large. Makes it easy to navigate and find what you are looking for.   Much more fun to go to Trader Joes than to WholeFoods... in my humble opinion.

STILL MY FAVORITE THAI RESTAURANT!!!   I have yet to find a decent Thai restaurant in Jacksonville, and had to come back to Arizona to get good Thai food.   I was sooooo happy with my meal tonight. And the prices are so cheap!   The curry noodles, masaman beef, pineapple rice, and panang curry... all amazing! We have so much left over we will be eating for two days.   The only small complaint is that this location is very small.

My wife, daughter and myself had a really enjoyable meal here at Saigon Nites. My initial yen was for the Pho... but we all decided to share a few of the other entrees... and we went for the Beef Stew and a noodle dish.  But dishes were really, really good! The stew was very "brothy" (more like a soup)... but the abundant beef was falling apart tender.   The prices are really reasonable.  We will be back!

LOVE NICKS! I have been coming here for many years... and the food has always been really good... at really reasonable prices.  I tend to stick with the pasta dishes... as all the pasta is fresh and homemade. My favorite dish on the menu it the fresh pasta, homemade sausage, peppers and onions, in a marinara sauce... amazing! I have also had the chicken marsala... also very good.   The tiramisu dessert is amazing... make sure you save room. Also they sever Illy coffee which is wonderful. Great way to cap of the meal.   My one word of warning is: Do Not overdo it on the bread before your meals arrives on the table!   A true testament to this place is that everytime I come in it is always BUSY! This is true on a Tuesday night as it is on Saturday.

My wife loves this place.... she is an avid knitter. Its really great to have this nice little shop only a mile form the house. Now she can spend more money on her yarn "stash".   There are relatively new owners, and they are really nice. Nice selection of yards, and accessories. Books, and knitting magazines, and patterns.   Helpful knowledgeable staff are always available.  I go and sit and drink coffee... and nod a lot when my wife shows me yarn and asks for my opinion! :)

Chick-Fil-A has my most favorist (it's a word) fries! I love the waffle fries they serve...yum!   Chick-Fil-A has bar none the best service of any fast food chain that I know of! They serve the food to your table, they will come clean up your sloppy mess after your meal, and even offer to get you a drink refill!   I love the chicken sandwiches.  Another hidden gem is the "handspun" milkshakes... SO GOOD!  I wish they were open on Sundays.

I am back in Phoenix visiting for the week and was excited to have some good Mexican food again. Well this wasn't it!!!   I ordered a house margarita and it was AWFUL! all sour mix and no tequila. Just bad. The chips they served with salsa were on the soggy side with little flavor. Reminded me of the crunchy noodles you put into wonton soup.   I had the taco salad. So very not exciting. The shell was soggy. The shredded beef lacked flavor. Skimped on the sour cream. Not very good.  The worst part was our waiter! He was a very snide nasty son of biscuit!!!! we used a restaurant.com gift certificate for our meal. He then very rudely to.d us we couldn't use it for lunch. NO where on the certificate did it indicate this. We asked him to show us, and he couldn't. Then he said he would accept it "this one time", and it was going to have to come out of his pocket. To bleeping bad. Cry to restaurant.com. Not my problemo.  Also...try finding this place....not easy. It's in the far back corner of a Bashas supermarket strip shopping center.

I eat here frequently. I really dig the medium extra crispy chicken wings. They also do a really decent job of New York style pizza.  They have a GREAT lunch deal: 2 slices of cheese pizza with a drink for $5.00 including tax! Its way better than a CrapDonalds Value Meal!  Also a must recommend: The sugarfree lemoncello cheese cake! Sooo good!

O-M-G!!! I LOVE MRS. WHITE!!! (And her chicken)  We actually saw a brief piece on the Food TV channel about Mrs. White (The Best Thing I Ever Ate Show... on Fried Chicken). So we knew we had to go. We made the drive all the way from North Scottsdale... and I was not one bit disappointed!  We got there about 7PM on a Friday night... and the place was really dead. Only one other table...there was also a lot of writing on the walls... so I was a little "nervous". But Deseree (our server) made us feel at home.   The menu is easy... ALL meals are $13 buck. You choose from several main entrees... and about 8 southern soul food style side (you can pick two).   I ordered the fried chick, sweet potatoes (yams) and the black eyed peas. My wife got the same but had the mac and cheese.   You must also order the Kool-Aid... HUGE glass... and many childhood memories.   You get three ***HUGE** pieces of PERFECTLY seasoned (and cooked) fried chicken... and the two sides... unbelievable! The black eyed peas and sweet potatoes... UNREAL!   We could not even finish half of our meal... and we took home an order of Mrs. White famous Peach Cobbler, which we enjoyed with coffee after we got home. TO DIE FOR!  In summary... GREAT MEAL! Great casual (almost divey) atmosphere. It was fun reading all the famous signatures on the wall.   Thank You Mrs. White!!

My business partner and I went into Eddie Chans Asian Bistro last night for a dinner business meeting. This was like my 5th trip in Eddie's.  We had the Orange Chicken and the Mongolian Beef. And I can tell you folks.... this was no flippin' Panda Express! The chicken in the orange Chicken was sliced so thin, which makes it incredible crispy when done up in the orange chicken sauces.   The Mongolian Beef was equally tasty. It was such a pleasant surprise.   Eddie Chan also took the time to come by and check on us. I love when owner/operators do this. It means they care!  I can't wait to go back!

I like this Basha's.... its local, and convenient. I don't think they are the cheapest place in town to shop... but it's around the corner from where I live.  I also like supporting local Arizona business.  The staff at this Basha's is always very friendly, and I like to frequent one store so you get to know the staff.   They often run a $10 dinner "combo" package that is a really fair deal if you don't feel like cooking. You get to pick from different items and piece together a meal for $10. Not bad to feed a family of 4.

The TPC's 16th Hole is looking good right now for next weeks Waste Management's Phoenix Open.  I came over here to stake out my spot. Looks like they tournament people have everything ready to go for the start... plenty of bars and porta-potties!  Having a VIP pass is key to really enjoying this nutty place during the week.... not fun seeking out porta-potties after an afternoon of the caliber of drinking that goes on here.  Hope to see you all here.... and lets all be honest.... we don't go to really watch golf being played!

I have been coming somewhat regularly the last few weeks for lunch. I have discovered that the "BBQ/Grill" area in the back near the butcher counter has a daily $5 lunch special with is fairly good. This week it has been the BBQ Brisket sandwich with one small side (beans, fries, or potato salad). Its a filling dish and well worth the 5 bucks! Normally the same dish goes for $8.99... so its a deal.  Of course there is the whole rest of the store that will quickly eat up your paycheck! Hence the nickname.... "Whole Paycheck"! :)  I also have eaten from the burrito area (think Chipotle). Also very good... large servings, at a fair price.

For my birthday dinner I enjoyed my "usual" dish... the Sizzling Surf and Turf... shrimp and filet mignon... can't go wrong! Get it with the wasabi mashed potato upgrade. Worth it!   My wife really enjoyed her Evil Jungle Princess Chicken... I couldn't keep my fork from snatching bites while trying to distract her.  We also KILLED the Chocolate Volcano for dessert... which they bought to the table for my birthday. It was incredible!  As always... a good meal at a good place.  My wife really enjoyed her

Made my first trip to Sweet Republic tonight.... Shared the butter toffee sundae with my lovely bride. It was the perfect size for two people to snack on.   The young lady behind the counter welcomed us into the shop warmly... And explained everything about the process.... How everything is handmade. This told us as soon as we walked in that this was a special place.   She also told us that Alton Brown from the Food TV channel will be back this month...always a fun thing.   I can't wait to go back!!!

What a beautiful building! I feel like I am in an art museum and not a public library!  When you first enter the library... you feel like you are walking through a cavern. Amazing!  The library itself is beautiful... high ceilings... plenty of seating, free wifi. Magazines and books! All they need is a Starbucks kiosk and it would be nirvana.

I love this place...most new books are readily available. Free WIFI, great AC... they even have passes for free admission to museums in town! And its all free!  Go grab a good book and tell them that Steve sent ya!

Chef Harrison was fun to learn from! I do tech work all day, and having a nice distraction (learning to cook a dish) was a much needed break. Anything "offline" in my life right now is nice.  The few new things I learned were awesome in making sauces. I have already applied them in new dishes I am trying with my wife.  The class was organized, informative and fun. I would definitely recommend it to other interested in learning to cook healthy.

Love the Tom Ka Gai soup! Love the Pinapple Rice! Consistently pleased when ever I dine here...which is frequently.

I frequently dine at Market Bistro about twice a week. I LOVE the "Build Your Own" salads. The ingredients are ALWAYS super fresh, and the value is beyond compare... especially for the area it is in North Scottsdale.  Often time I will be in the Kierland or Scottsdale Quarter area, and given the vast choice of restaurants in the vicinity, I will almost ALWAYS choose to make the 3 minute car ride over to Market Bistro. The food is almost always better... and ALWAYS cheaper for what you get.   Things to try... you won't be sorry... the Cuban Sandwich, the BBQ TriTip Steak Sandwich, and the Southwest Corn Chowder! ALL AMAZING!  They have some wine, and bottled beer.

This place is always packed!!! But it is a great place to work because they have the coolest "desktops" near the front entrance.  There are also an abundance of the "comfy" living room style chairs.   This is a "big" Starbuck compared to others in the area. There is almost always a line waiting to order. But they keep things moving.   Aside from my above comments... its a Starbucks. You either love it or hate it.

I COME HERE **WAY** TO OFTEN!!!   I always ALWAYS get the same thing EVERYTIME (sad I know)... but it's the 3 Egg Build Your Own Omelet with EVERYTHING in it! I love it because it like having 20 different omelet taste experiences all at once!!! One bite your get a mouth full of bacon, the next broccoli, the next chorizzo, etc, etc. The omelets are HUGE! The potato's on the side are great, as is the pancakes.   Before you go here.... shop around on Restaurant.com, LocalDines, Groupon, etc.... there are ALWAYS coupons for the Breakfast Joynt!   Most of the servers have been there a while, and you get that certain "regular" feel that makes you feel at home.... you know when that happens when your server knows exactly how you like your eggs cooked... and can convey that to the cook!  There is an iHop literally a block away.... but as far as comparisons... its a world apart!   Support your local business!!!  Nuff Said! See you at the Joynt!

Love this place! The quality of the FroYo is excellent! My wife (who is not ordinarily a person who likes yogurt frozen or otherwise) also LOVES this place!  The fresh fruit is superb, and a great accompaniment to the frozen yogurt. They always have several varieties, with someone standing by to dole out samples.   Pricing is about .45 cents per ounce..... so be careful of going crazy... cause you don't know how much you are spending till you checkout and they weigh your haul. There are TONS of toppings to choose from... be forewarned!!! Each one add's to the overall weight... noting like spending $12 bucks on a cup of gummy bears and marshmallow topping!  The staff is also uber-anal about keeping the place spotless! God forbid one chocolate chip lands outside the dispensing tray!!!   I really like this place... maybe a little too much!   TIP: Signup for their mailing list for regular specials.

I am not often in this area as a general rule... but my daughter live pretty close, so I always make a detour into Dutch Bros Coffee!   I just filled up my first punch card so now I get a FREE coffee next visit! Yay!  I always get the hot Latte Breve... so much BETTER than Starbucks!  Highly Recommended!

What a beautiful spot to walk around. It amazes me that we live so close to such natural splendor.  Scottsdale did a really nice job with this preserve. I like the different degrees of difficulty they have clearly marked. I took the easy trail... and enjoyed myself.

I spend a lot of time here as a remote office. Meghan, the proprietor, is *always* very welcoming and warm. She remembers my standard order, and does not seem to mind that I spend a lot of time working out of her establishment.   The varieties of coffee is good. The pastries are good. I have not tried one of their sandwiches yet.   I enjoy the "homey" atmosphere... puzzles, cards, and books.... for the clientele to enjoy.   I also enjoy supporting a "local" coffee house over a big chain.

Contrary to many previous "reviewers" I think the prices at Amores are very fair what the food you get.   I am partial to the Chicken Cutlet Parmesan sandwich. The foot long is HUGE... with tons of ingredients. Great bread. Good Sauce.   If you get an order of fries... more than enough for two people.   I usually go here for lunch... and they have a slew of $5.00 lunch specials... (2) slices of cheese pizza and a drink, and several 6" sandwiches with chips and a drink. It's fairly good... and they have to be with a Subway store directly next to their shop.   They also deliver... which I have taken advantage of a few times without incident.   So all in all... for a "local" pizza/sandwich/wings spot... give it a try. Would I go out of my way to visit... probably not.   I should note: the same people also own Amore's Sports Bar over on Bell and the 101.

I really enjoyed my "New Yorker" today! Polish dog, with onions, sauerkraut, and mustard! I did the healthy thing and had a side of onion rings (yes my heart thanked me).   My only "complaint" is the same one Scott D. recently had.... the bun fell apart on me half way through me meal. Granted... this did not stop me from still eating it! :)  My meal (hotdog, rings, and a drink) was a few pennies shy of $10... which is a little pricey (in my humble opinion) for a "hotdog" lunch. I guess I miss the REAL "New Yorker's".... being in NYC and getting the same thing for a BUCK from a hotdog pushcart.... plus a knish!

I like shopping the clearance deals they have at Stein Mart... usually good quality clothing at reasonable prices. The selection here also tends not to be "one offs" (only one pieces of clothing in a particular style or color), like Ross or Marshalls tends to be. They have a pretty good variety.  Also... use the Stein Mart loyalty card (the one you keep on your keychain)... they track points, which leads to greater savings at the checkout.

Stopped in today (Sunday afternoon)... this restaurant is located in between several furniture stores.  I had never been to the original joint up in Cave Creek, so I have nothing to compare it to.  My wife and I shared a loaded burger and a dozen medium wings.  The food was "good"... nothing stellar as bar food goes.   I did enjoy the draft micro brews they had to choose from.  Service was good.  And I definitely used the 15% Yelp discount!  I will stop back again if I am the neighborhood.

This is by far the BEST buffet I have eaten at in the Phoenix area!!! We were here a few weeks ago for dinner, and again today for the Sunday Brunch.   The selection is enormous. And so good... there is so much seafood options to choose from.   What I hate about buffets in general is that the food is usually cooked poorly when cooked in large quantities... but that is totally not the case here. All the meat and fish I sampled were cooked perfectly.   This venue is very comparable... if not better than most buffets in Vegas!!!   Sunday Brunch was $26.... but well worth it. Besides... you can earn your money back for your meal at the slot machines!

This place is sooo conveniently close to my office... it's hard not to go to often. But, as other reviewers have stated its a little pricey for a "fast food" style burger joint. Granted that this is NO McDonalds!! But... In and Out is not far away either... and they are pretty damn good too! This is a place I come 2 -3 times a month... more than that and you will need to see your doctor and have them check the cholesterol!   I love the burgers here. They are huge, delicious, and fresh. Be careful ordering the larger order of fires... as they are huge! And you can get them with Cajun seasoning.    One thing I absolutely love... as I am a gadget guy, and "buttons" make me happy... is the soft drink dispenser!!! It is uber-cool.... and hard not to play with!

My wife and I were down at the Phoenix Market the other evening and had the pleasure of enjoying one one Torched Goodness Creme Brûlées!   It is a treat to watch them prep this dessert with their blow torch in front of you.  It was $4.00, which is fair for the fresh quality you get. Now (in my opinion) it is not as good as the Creme Brûlées I have had at Ruths CHris... but we enjoyed it none the less.  We have also seen these guys at the farmers market on Shea and 93rd street on Saturday mornings.

I got try try this amazing concoction the other night at Yelps Ultimate Science Fair.... and it was by far one of my favorites at the event!   I sample two flavors, and they were amazing. The liqueur in the ice cream gives it that extra "something" that most other ice creams you have lack.  I can't wait to get down to the store and try some more!

This park is nicely fenced in with a "sally port" (prison reference) type entry system... so dogs cannot accidental run out.   My dogs love it here... I guess that's all that counts! :)  It seems recently that they are trying to do some new improvement... its also really hot... so its hard to keep up the grass... especially with dogs running all over it.   It's big enough for the dogs to have a blast... but not to big to keep on eye on things.   I have been here a dozen times or so... and have never had any issues with other dogs being to aggressive.

I had fun walking around this little gem! I read the website so I knew that my dogs were welcome. (They probably had just as much fun as I did).   The market is in the same shopping center as Ling and Louie's (one of my favorites).   There were two "fresh" produce vendors there. I was hoping for a larger selection as it is billed as a "farmers market'. Things are definitely a little pricier than in a super market... but you definitely get what you pay for.   I picked up some fresh local salsa. And a bag of local (Tempe) made cheese curds!   All in all its a MUST RECOMMEND!

So... I will preface my review by saying that I like Jimmy John's sandwiches. I think they are a great value... product vs. price. They are generally fresh, tasty, and about $5.50 for a decent sandwich.   That being said... For this particular location.... Last night (Sunday evening) I went online and placed an order for two sandwiches... the online process is very smooth and intuitive. I paid online as well, and as it turns out, I fortunately printed and took my receipt.   I drove to the store and walked in.  That's where it ALL WENT DOWN HILL!!! They had the music SO FRIGGING LOUD it hurt my ears to listen to it. And it was that crappy heavy head banging acid rock that always sounds like people are screaming incoherently with the mike shoved half way down their throat.  Then... as I struggled to converse with the "kid" (literally) at the register... he could not find any reference of my online order. Nor could several other "kids" who worked their this Sunday evening.  This was supposed to have been "ready for me to pickup". Finally a manager came over and apologized and found the order in the system.   Thankfully Jimmy John's prides itself on making the sandwiches fast... but I couldn't even hear them calling my name when they were ready.   Hopefully someone from corporate will read this review and act upon it. Defiantly not a satisfying experience.

In a town FILLED with awesome Mexican food places... this place is sorely out of it's league! Nothing worse than paying more than you should for what amounts to nothing more than mediocre food. Places like this should always remember that there is never a Taco Bell never far away.   Was my lunch edible? Sure. Was if good? No. Was I upset I paid $8? Yes!  These guys need to take trip to Filiberto's and see what you get for five bucks. HUGE carne asada burritos... that's what!   Looking over everyone else reviews, I guess I am going against the grain on this one... but I call it like I see it.  This place was way better when a Krispy Kreme donut stood in its same location. You should walk the extra few feet and eat at In and Out Burger.

Friggin gas here is ALWAYS way OVERPRICED from the rest of the Valley! It's almost criminal.  They sell a bunch of other crap inside.... standard convenience store fare.  I live nearby and this place is "convenient"... so I allow myself to be ripped off.   Shame on me!

This place is off the hook! It is so definately worth the few extra dollars for the few hours of luxury...and to be pampered and waited on while watching a movie.  We indulged in the automatic wine dispensers in the lobby. They were offering wine tasting/sampling prior to purchasing.  We ordered dessert off the menu (oreo ice cream cake). We had dinner at the TKs Urban Tavern here in the Scottsdale Quarter (separate review).  The chairs are so comfortable... pillows and blankets are a nice plus.  It was a great indulgence!  As other reviewers here have stated... this is a nice once in a while date night out.

They made me the best Breve Latte I have had in a good long while.... and the barista made it beautiful! I had to take a picture.  This is a great place to stop into in you are strolling Scottsdale Quarter. I like to go here before I see a movie at the near-by iPic theater.

My wife and I sat at the bar on a Friday evening.... We both ordered the Cavatelli pasta with pulled braised short ribs, sun dried tomatoes, and spinach.... OMG! So damed good. The pasta is made there from scratch. And you can taste the quality. The dish was not drowning in sauce, so you could taste each ingredient.  Shawn (one of the managers) came by a few times to check on us. He even bought us by a few homemade onion rings for us to try....awesome!  The person sitting next to me had the steak salad....which looked incredible.   My only "critique" (and it would not be a fair review without one) is that the dishes seemed a little on the small side. Most of the entrees are in the $15 - $20 range. So my pasta dish was much smaller than say I would get at the Olive Garden.... BUT the ingredients were all fresh and homemade.   And I LOVE to support local non-chain restaurants.  We will be back!

I had the chance to eat from the Hey Joe truck today when all the food trucks were up in Scottsdale at the Whole Foods Market on Raintree.   I had the "Valley Dish" which was Pancit noodles, 2 lumpia,  and some rice. The dish was yummy... and it was a treat to have Fillipino food for lunch up in Scottsdale. The dish was $8 bucks. I think it was fair for the portion.   I look forward to eating from the Hey Joe truck again when I can make it down to the Phoenix Market.

Nice brand new Froyo shop around the corner from my place. Great selection of frozen yogurt flavors... but I really like the little LCD screens with the nutritional info for each flavor.   You are welcome to taste each flavor.  Large selection of fresh fruit toppings, as well as the assorted other decadent treats... gummy bears, sprinkles, and my fav... cheese cakes bits!  Pricing is .45 per ounce... about the same as Yogurtology. Be careful how much you put into your cup!!! If you go crazy you will end up with a $12 yogurt sundae!! :)

It's weird that that the reviews are so skewed for Capriottis Sandwich Shop. I have eaten here several times, and have enjoyed it each time. I think the thing that hurts them more than anything else is the "Best Sandwich In America" banner hanging out front. The sandwiches are really good... but best in America is a little far reaching.  That being said... I usually get the "Bobby"... Thanksgiving on a bun! It's a pretty damn good sandwich... it you like thanksgiving dinner. The turkey is freshly made, as is the stuffing they put on the sandwich.   I have also had the meatball sub... also very good.   I like this place. And I am pretty sure you will like this place.   Make sure you tell them you signed up for their "text message" program to get a free drink and chips on your first visit.

I drove into this place the other day.... and they offer 1950's FULL SERVICE at the pump!!! There are guys dressed in white overalls who will wash your windows and check your oil!!!! I love it!!!   The inside of the store is amazing... I went pay for my gas... and you pay at a pastry/espresso bar counter... and being a super sucker for sweets... I indulged! And boy was I glad... so yummy! Gas and Cupcakes. It's a no brainer.  They have a full service Artisan sandwich counter that has a full breakfast menu. I have not tried any of the sandwiches... yet. But I will.   They also sell fresh cut flowers, a small selection of fresh produce, and other assorted convenience store fair.   As Scott D. mentioned... the gas is about a dime less the the nearest Shell station.   I like this place. I hope if does well. It's definitely not another Circle-K. It's a refreshing change. Give it a visit!

My daughter went absolutely gaga over this place. So I made a trip.... and it is a pretty nice little shop. I wasn't completely blown away. They sell mostly cupcakes... and they are really good.   My two favorites are the Creme Brulee.... ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! And the Raspberry Cheesecake.... which has a real cheesecake base.   I tried one of the chocolate cupcakes, but didn't find it anything special (it was good mind you), just not my fav.  I was surprised to see this is actually a growing "chain" of bakeries.   The other "clever" thing here is how this place is nestled directly between Jimmy Johns and Five Guys! Coincidence... I think not!
