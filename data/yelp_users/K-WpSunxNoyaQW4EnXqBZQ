I came to Pink Polish initially because I got a gift certificate from my boss. I come here frequently. Every other place I've been since has been such a disappointment. They have a ton of colors to choose from and do both gel manis and pedis! The techs wear gloves and use sanitized tools. The venue is highly sanitary and they take a high precaution for spread of infection. (This is coming from a medical professional!). So that is very reassuring considering the horror stories I've heard in the past.   I also nanny a 3 year-old that I bring with me sometimes and they never shy away or charge me very much or at all for her. Everyone speaks very good English and is always engaged in conversation. If I were to get married this is where I would take my bridal party!  I've never done any of their waxing services but I believe they offer a few. Bottom line, if you're in the area, or not...it's worth a trip :)

I have been to a few barre studios, this one is by far the best. Bonus points-they are on class pass!   At other barre studios I felt the atmosphere was super snobby, a "were better and stronger than you," attitude. I took the 6am class this morning and felt very welcomed, respected, and encouraged. I work out everyday; weights, cardio, dance, you name it I've done it. And this workout was challenging! However if you were a beginner you could absolutely get a great workout and go at your own pace without pressure, so really an all levels kind of place. Better barre workout than I've had at other places. My abs and booty are most definitely going to be sore. I will be back- and I can't wait for the next workout!

I read a lot of reviews before going on this hike and I'm going to just conclude the best of all of the tips in this review.   Let's start with-I'm a fit 27 year old gal and workout at least 5 times per week. I love hiking but probably go only about 10 times in a year (so, not often.) I can make it up camelback in 45 minutes comfortably and mostly because who I'm with needs to take a few breaks along the way.   Now that the disclaimer is out of the way here is my opinion and best tips!   1. This hike is worth the 3 hours it takes to get up because the view is incredible.   2. Go early. We left the car 8:15am and got back to the car at 1:15pm and by that time it was hot.  3. Bring sunscreen, lots of water (camelpack is ideal), snack for the top, hat, hiking gloves, and good hiking shoes. Many of the parts can be slick and you need good traction. Oh and a camera!   4. This is not for those who cannot do camelback comfortably. In distance and elevation it is literally going up camelback twice and coming down twice in one trip. It's tedious and you do a lot of scrambling up big boulders. You need steady legs to come down with.   5. Near the top there is a vertical rock before the "nature walk trail" to the summit. Go up the wall on the right, come down that same wall on the left using the sturdy tree! I am kind of afraid of heights and this was valuable info!  We also camped at the campground. We were the only tent camping crew there. It was super clean, quiet, and open. It was the four seasons of camp grounds!

Sumit yoga is amazing! I had never done hot yoga before I went to Sumits and I am obsessed. The teachers are amazing, the atmosphere is peaceful, yet energetic, and the students are all kind and can teach you so much. My favorite classes have been with either Julie, Jamie (I think she has since moved away), or Jordan. But each class is the same as the last with the exact same flow so whoever you decide to go with, you know exactly what to expect. I've never done the hot flow but understand that it's a little slower, and a little cooler than the sumit classes.    Find which teacher shares your energy, and spiritual needs and enjoy each session! Namaste!!

This was fantastic! Went for my birthday celebration with my boyfriend. The menu is a little confusing at first but basically each person can order 3, 4, or 5 courses (which is cheaper than ordering a la carte). We shared the ahi tuna, farmers market salad, buratta, raviolo, brisket, and risotto. 6/6 we're all amazing and we were very impressed.   They greeted us with a prosecco toast for our celebration and we're very informative and kind!  The pricing was a little high in my opinion but at the same time you can't get that food anywhere else in the valley so cheers to them. Excellent experience!

I don't have enough nice things to say about the barking dog. The facilities are clean, the employees get excited to see my pup and know her by name. Their prices are incredibly competitive and you get discounts on grooming when you board so my golden always come home tuckered out and clean! I've been taking my golden here for about 8 months now (multiple times per week and at least 3 times for boarding) and it's always a positive experience.   They have even offered to take her to my preferred vet should anything happen while I'm away. The staff truly loves animals and are passionate about what they do. It shines through the customer service and how excited my dog is when we arrive in the mornings   Love love love this place! Highly recommended!

If you like southern comfort food like your grandmother used to make- you need to eat here.   Not a place to go if you're dieting. This is a cheat meal place!! The "snacks" are a tapas style presentation of smaller plates to share. We had chicken skins, friend green beans, the nduja dates (), hush puppies, country ham and hoe cakes. Literally you can not order wrong. We shared the chicken and dumplings for dinner and it was nostalgic! Just like Grandmom used to make .   You cannot leave before ordering the salted Carmel donut. They make it to order and it's hot and sweet and perfect. This place is incredible!

The food is incredible here and reasonably priced. You're definitely in for an amazing experience!!!  Unfortunately, the first time we went we had an issue with the bill and it took a little while to get resolved. But once we sent an email to LGO Hospitality they returned it with a more than generous gift card, sincere apology, and invited us back to dine on them. I am SO impressed with their willingness and confidence as a company to realize their mistakes, correct them, and gain more business from an original sub-par experience. We LOVE LGO and go often, (actually ate there last night!!) If you're looking for a good date night, celebration, or new restaurant to dine you should absolutely pick this one. They will not let you down!   We had oysters as an appetizer. From someone that loves oysters and is from the gulf I'm very particular. They were very small- but super fresh and yummy!  We hen split the avocado salad. The kalamata olives make it salty and the dressing and avocado make it fresh and the tomatoes a good sweet bite. Amazing.  I had the pasta- very obviously in house made noodles with fresh shrimp and herbs. My mouth is watering it was so good!   My boyfriend had the scallops and polenta--nothing short of spectacular. The scallops were fresh and perfectly tender and sweet. The creamy salty polenta was the perfect combo.   My boyfriend had the buck & rider rue cocktail and I will definitely be ordering that next time.   Can't wait to go back! Bon appetite!

I hate to give a bad review to such a great chef's restaurant, but feel it's necessary after our experience at this restaurant last night! I really am not one to complain, but I left very disappointed with my overall experience at Tratto.   We were out for a celebration last night and have been wanting to get to Tratto since in opened last month, as Chris Bianco is a well renowned chef in the valley for his "Pizzeria Bianco," which we love!  The restaurant is very chic with Italian rustic charm and elegance. Felt like we were in another city, and I loved that aspect of the restaurant.    We failed to make a reservation (on a Saturday evening...not a good idea, but we assumed we could not make one with only 2 people in a restaurant with ~30 seats.)  So we didn't mind waiting for the proposed hour that the hostess quoted us for a table or seats at the bar.  After working in the industry for a number of years we're well aware that as a hostess you always over quote your table waiting time to avoid the exact problem we ran into.  To be honest, I think she forgot about us because other people behind us got seated before us who also did not have a reservation.  However, we did not bring that up nor were we upset (outwardly) about having to wait over 2 hours to sit at the bar.    The hostess asked us if we wanted to order some drinks or cocktails, we agreed and gave her our order. We did not receive them for a long period of time (15-20 minutes) while sitting outside of the restaurant.    We finally got seated in the corner of the bar, and again waited an extended period of time before the bartender acknowledged we were there and asked if we wanted anything to drink.   Food: Antipasti-  *Chicken liver pate: don't order this unless you are a huge fan of pate, it is a lot to handle. A little too overwhelming with the amount of pate for the crostini and the rich flavors. Definitely something to share with other pate-lovers!   *Spring greens salad: light, lovely, simple. Lots of fresh, salty parmesan made it happen. A little bit of a flavorless shallot vinaigrette. It was good... nothing to write home about.   Primi- *Ricotta filled homemade pasta with dried peaches: amazing! This is what I was hoping for, fresh made, authentic Italian pasta. Not overwhelming with a thick sauce, just simple and full of flavor. This was the best thing that happened to us all night.   Secondi- *pork chop: sauce was light and refreshing with the tomatoes and fava beans, but the pork chop was way over done, and very dry.  Presentation was beautiful but the consistency failed to follow.   After a 4 hour long experience we opted out of dessert, I was just excited to get home.    My biggest complaint about this restaurant is that Chris Bianco was in the restaurant, we watched him stop by every table and ask how the service was, chat with his patrons.  However, he never came to us, the hostess never apologized, the bartender barely spoke to us. And after agreeing to wait all of that time, there was never a, "Thank you for your patients," or any attempt to even speak to us whatsoever. No explanation of the menu or, "a welcome into our restaurant for the first time, let us guide you through the menu." We've worked in the restaurant business and hospitality and we understand that even the smallest gesture of kindness goes a very long way in helping change an experience completely. I figured after we waited for so long they would be super excited that we stuck around to spend our money with them but instead we were ignored, almost blatantly.   You can put the best chef in town in the kitchen, but if the staff doesn't follow it's a big disaster. I understand it's new and there is always room for improvement but If I'm going to spend the money to eat out I want to be floored by the experience and enjoy something I'm not able to make or replicate at home...It's likely we won't return as there are so many talented chefs and amazing restaurants to be tried in the valley.     :(
