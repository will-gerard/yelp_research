The food here is just so good! This restaurant doesn't look like much on the outside but looks can be deceiving though. I came here with two of my friends and we were impressed with the quality of the food here overall. The location is not in the best area of Phoenix but overall that shouldn't deter you from coming here at all. At least it's fairly close to the airport making it a great spot for a meal.  I had the grilled fish + shrimp with the garlic sauce as well as refried beans + mexican rice. Everything was great! I'm looking forward to my next visit here already.

Came here with a friend of mine as we wanted to try some Mexican seafood and this restaurant is supposedly one of the best options in Phoenix. I haven't been here before they remodeled the interior to fit more seating but it definitely looks really nice now and very colorful inside.  We decided on getting the Shrimp Cocktail and the Molcajete for two people. The Shrimp Cocktail was very tasty and everything we had hoped for. As for the Molcajete we were a bit disappointed that there was quite a bit of chicken and steak since we had hoped for more seafood. The sauce used was a "Diabla" sauce which was really good and surprisingly not as spicy as I had anticipated. I'm glad that we tried their house specialty but would probably pass on it next time that we come here.  Service was friendly and prompt. Overall this is a great place if you're looking for Mexican style seafood!

I would just like to tell people about my great experience here at Sun Valley Stereo and having Ryan and his crew install new speakers in my car. After many years of keeping the sound system the same in my vehicle I finally decided to upgrade the speakers and the whole process was made very easy by Ryan. He did recommend Pioneer speakers and the price was definitely reasonable. Luckily his crew was able to install it right away since they had time.  It took them maybe about one hour to install the speakers and now my sound system in my car has been great improved! I highly recommend going to Sun Valley Stereo if you're looking to improve the sound system in your vehicle.

I ended up coming back here because I was concerned that one of the front speakers had bass distortion for the entire day that I was driving my vehicle. The next day it seemed to have fixed itself however I was still concerned that it happened so I had Ryan check to see what the issue could be. They were not sure what could have caused it but they still managed to exceed my expectations in which they truly went above and beyond by replacing the speaker at no extra charge. It could have just been a manufacturer's defect with the actual speaker.  Since my initial review I did go back one more time a few weeks later to install a new stereo system as well to replace my old one. It's such a great improvement and now the sound system is sounding better than ever! I really cannot praise Ryan and his crew highly enough for their service and they are also very knowledgeable folks at what they do.

I came here based on my co-worker's recommendation for Mexican food in the Phoenix area. The restaurant was not too hard to find and there was plenty of parking when we arrived. Friend of mine ordered 2 beef tacos and 2 chicken tacos and I ordered a chicken taco and the chicken torta. Overall we preferred the chicken tacos over the beef tacos and the chicken torta that I ordered was extremely tasty. We would even go as far to say that these were some of the best tacos that we ever had and both of us have been to plenty of Mexican restaurants in the past.  If I ever make my way back over here I would like to try either the quarter or half chicken as that seems to be a solid choice based on the pictures here. I'm not sure if this is the best Mexican food in the area or not given that there are so many options available but either way this place is really good and definitely worth a try!

While the menu is fairly straightforward with mostly a choice of hot or cold sandwiches, the execution is done well. This is an Italian Deli which seems to be frequented often by regulars and locals which is always a good sign. The customer service here seems to be very good as well in which it looks like a family run business. They only accept cash here though so keep that in mind.  I really liked their cheesesteak sandwiches and would definitely go back for them again.

Overall this was quite a disappointing experience. I first came here with a friend of mine who grew up in Arizona and he used to frequent this place. Although we didn't play any of the arcade games downstairs we went upstairs to the bar area where there are pool tables available. On a more recent visit I decided to take advantage of the remaining credit on my game card and there were only a few arcade games that I was interested in. It seems like Dave & Busters have a much better selection and after my recent visit I would rather head there instead.

After passing by this location so many times I finally decided to give this hot dog place a try. So I tried the regular hot dog, cheese fries, and vanilla shake for my first time. The hot dog was just okay but felt that I could have made a better choice by picking something else. Cheese fries were decent and I did like how the cheese came in a separate container cup. The vanilla shake was one of the best shakes that I've had and I have gone through plenty of milkshakes over the years in my travels. I will definitely be coming back to get that again.  There's not too much of an atmosphere here as there is more emphasis on them serving customers and it can hard to find an available table when it's busy. However this seems like a great spot for take-out as the food is prepared rather quickly. This restaurant has been here for many years and it's easy to see why it has been around for so long.

So I came here on a whim the other day for one of the daily poker tournaments held here. This place is alright, it caters mostly to the locals here and that is obvious when you walk-in. The condition of the casino is mediocre at best and the slot machines still pay out with coins! They do offer very cheap drinks & food at their snack shack which is a plus.  The poker tournament, well I have to say it was poorly managed compared to the other ones that I've been to. They offer add-ons and re-buys which makes the game take a lot longer than it normally does, and while I knew that upfront it does get frustrating when people buy-in multiple times and it seems like the game is going on forever.

I was very happy with my experience dealing with Reliable Glass. My front door passenger window was unfortunately broken into and I needed to have the glass replaced. My first interaction with Reliable Glass was very positive and they scheduled me in as soon as possible to have the glass replaced.  The technician came on time as promised, however the glass that they had was not a perfect fit due to my vehicle being a Japanese model. After receiving a quote from the technician as to what the additional cost would come out to I called around other glass companies. To my surprise Reliable Glass had the lowest quote out of all of them so I made another appointment to get the OEM glass switched out with the other one.  Overall I was impressed with Reliable Glass and would give them a call should I need my windshield replaced.

This restaurant doesn't look like much on the outside but the atmosphere is really great! We made reservations that evening and there was not a problem getting a table at all. The service was prompt and friendly.  We decided on just getting the specials for the evening after some contemplation. My father got the 8 oz Filet Mignon and I ended up getting the seafood special with lobster sauce. I enjoyed the assortment of seafood and some bread to dip into the lobster sauce. I tried a little bit of the steak as well which was excellent, although I usually don't have steak on the norm.  While the experience was wonderful we thought it was a bit too pricey for what was being offered. Even still I would recommend Roaring Fork and may come back to try out their happy hour menu sometime.

I like coming here mainly because of the location being right off Hayden and also they have some good lunch specials here. Unfortunately the lunch specials have been hit or miss but overall I would recommend their food. The service here is good as the people working are very friendly and I like the quiet and mellow atmosphere that this place has. I never had any issues with the service and they do refill your waters frequently.  Chicken Chow Mein = So far my favorite of the lunch specials, although it's quite basic in nature. I did like the sauce they used for the noodles as it flows well with the fried rice. Pad Thai = It's been a while since I had it but I remember it being good. Sliced Chicken With Garlic Sauce = Would probably pass on it next time, not the best choice in my opinion.  I would recommend the fried rice with the lunch specials as it's quite good. As for the egg drop vs. hot & sour soup - I preferred the egg drop soup. I'm not sure what it was but the hot & sour soup tasted a bit off to me.

Alright so the reviews here are spot on. The sandwiches here are VERY good and I can see why this place is so busy all the time. I had both the Cheese steak and the Chicken Parm - both are excellent choices and it's hard for me to decide on a favorite. I would like to try their pasta sometime here which only means that I should come back here on another visit.  The location is a bit tricky to find at first but it's not too bad, it's right across from the China Wok right across from the parking lot. I would recommend calling ahead and ordering your food beforehand as they are quite busy during the lunch rush. As it is part grocery and part restaurant I would also recommend take out if they're busy since there's not much seating.

This is a really great place to sample some beers! I did get the sampler and managed to try eight different beers which was great as this is a brewery. While I'm not much of a beer drinker myself I can definitely appreciate the time and effort it takes to make great local brews. I also ordered the fish & chips which were quite good. Not the best that I had but it's up there. The bartender asked if I wanted to try some seasonal brews which I was surprised about but was glad to try them.  The atmosphere is pretty cool but I'm not sure how I like that industrial feel to this place, then again it's a brewery after all. Service was decent even though there are a lot of younger bar and wait staff here, not that it matters because it seemed like they were doing a pretty good job.  Parking situation here is a bit tough but luckily I came at a slow time so it was easy to find parking and be served fairly quickly.

I had no idea they have drink specials here before 10 PM so that might be good for the next time that I visit. Despite this place obviously appealing to the college aged crowd I did enjoy my time here especially since I always enjoy a game of billiards with friends and the table rates here are in line compared to some other pool halls nearby.  Depending on the night there could be a lot of people waiting outside to get inside (as I have seen before) in which case I'm not sure if that would be worth the wait even though the line seems to move relatively quickly. Also on the weekend nights they do tend to play the music a bit too loud in my opinion although that could be the appeal to others?  I would like to come back here again when the table rates are discounted.

Wow this place is incredible! This has to be one of the best spots in Arizona to get some Middle Eastern food. I tried their Chicken Shawarma plate and one of their sandwiches, both were outstanding. The plate was good in just about every way and the portions are huge. The garlic sauce that they use is really good and compliments the rice and chicken so well. My favorite would have to be their sandwiches as it was just perfect.  They do have a small grocery inside as well which is certainly very convenient combined with the restaurant.

This place is definitely a really nice hidden gem in this area of Tempe. The people running the sandwich shop are so lovely and you can tell that they put so much effort into their sandwiches and it shows! I would highly recommend the "truth" sandwich which I actually learned about on here and decided to order it without knowing what it actually consists of. It doesn't really matter though because once you've tried this sandwich there's no going back! Easily one of the best sandwiches that I've ever had.  Their other sandwiches are great as well, tried one of their cold sandwiches (turkey) which I was satisfied with. I would recommend calling your order in as they do get very busy here and takeout is the better option it seems like. The prices are extremely reasonable and sandwiches are good, it's no wonder there is always a line close to being out the door every time I visit.

This place is the real deal if you want some awesome burgers near ASU. Chuck Box has been around for decades and I just had to see what the burgers were all about. I decided to try their small cheeseburger and fries. You can tell that them putting the patties on the charcoal grill makes a huge difference as far as taste, and it was very good. Their fries too are some of the better ones that I've had as well.  While the food was certainly very good and I would come back here again, there are some gripes that I have with this place. Parking around here can be difficult which could potentially deter me from coming here more often. Also, the ordering assembly line style can be awkward somewhat at times but it's not a big deal to me. As long as the food is good I don't really care about those things but I just wanted to make others aware of them.  I do anticipate coming back here again as the food was excellent.

I got the Strawberry Daiquiri for $15 with the extra shot and I gotta say, that was probably the best deal for a drink that I can ever remember. The drink itself was amazingly good and it was awesome to walk along the strip. Anyway, I highly recommend this place if you are looking to drink in Las Vegas.

Regency Auto Spa is one of the best car washes in the area (if not the best). Located right next to UNLV, these guys do a terrific job at a fast + efficient wash. There is a waiting area inside and they even have massage chairs! I get my exterior of the car washed about 2-3 times a month since I own a black exterior car which needs to be maintained regularly.  If you get another wash within one week, I believe it's 50% off but I never tried it yet.

Unfortunately my friends didn't like this restaurant that much the last time I went to Las Vegas, but I thought it was great. You can "build" your own burger depending on the ingredients you want. I'm gonna have to dock a star because the one time I went there, our waitress was SO slow when it came time to place orders. Once the actual food came out though, it was worth it.

The Mirage is one of those hotels on the strip that deserves more credit than it should. There's a lot to see and do and I haven't even experienced close to everything yet. I would be careful about the restaurants inside the property as they are overpriced and the quality of the food was just sub-par for me compared to meals that you can get elsewhere which was really disappointing. Other than that the Mirage still shines strong and it's a great hotel if you want to stay somewhere nice but not too expensive on your budget.  The casino portion of the hotel is really great, most importantly I like the atmosphere of the casino compared to other casinos on the strip. If you enjoy playing poker then you will love the poker room here. The dealers here are very friendly and the action here can be crazy!

This place is incredible with the amount of dedication put forth in maintaining all of those pinball machines. On the website they have listed about 150 pinball machines plus other arcade games are also available for play as well. The location is well hidden and took me a second glance to finally realize where it was.  Anyway since I live here for the summer I love to nerd it up here playing all of these pinball games from the past. I actually own the P: HoF Williams Collection on the Wii so it was great to see half of those tables here available for play. Those tables would include Black Knight, Fire Power, Funhouse, Pinbot, and Space Shuttle.  P: HoF is truly a hidden gem here in Las Vegas.

I came here for dinner along with some friends. The atmosphere was awesome and I'll probably be coming back here the next time I go to Las Vegas in two weeks. The service was good, they came around a few times asking if we wanted refills on our drinks so that's nice to see. The food was especially good for a buffet, but the best part was the dessert. Make sure to save room for dessert.  This is a great spot to come back to once in a while.

I went here during my vacation trip. The line was not that long for me to get in, but that's probably due to me getting there late at around 1 in the morning.  Anyway, I was very impressed with this nightclub. There is an outdoor area with a bar and the view was nice. The inside was huge with three floors which I thought was amazing, plus they have bottle service if you pay the loads for it. I'm not much of a clubbing person myself, but coming here was definitely a good experience.

I enjoy coming to Olive & Ivy for the few times that I've been here. Be sure to try their complimentary bread with pesto sauce! The pesto sauce that they use is fresh and is amazing. So far for lunch I've had the Margherita flatbread and the Turkey Grinder sandwich, both were excellent. Prices are very reasonable as well considering the quality and effort that they put into their food.  The atmosphere is great as well and I loved the interior decor.

I've never had Ethiopian food, but this was a good experience. The restaurant doesn't look like much on the outside, but that definitely changes once you see the indoor decor. I enjoyed the authentic food that was provided here, my order was the whole fish with rice and salad. I don't know what that sauce is called but it had a nice spicy kick to it. All of the food was delicious and I'm glad I stopped by.

I can definitely see why people come here for the pasties. The Chicken Tikka Masala pasty was tasty and I also ordered a cider which was good as well. While the food and drinks were great, the atmosphere could have been better and it was a bit too dark inside for my liking. Also this location seems to attract a lot of university students from ASU, so I may want to try another location to see how it compares.

I have been coming here since the beginning of the year with my first visit being a complete vehicle inspection mainly to get ready for the summer season. Ever since the inspection I have been taking my vehicle to this shop to get some of their recommended work done on it. They have only been honest about their recommendations - although their prices are not the cheapest around I would like to think that you do get a peace of mind by going with them and they stand by their work. The people working at the front are friendly and always willing to help whenever possible. They do have a complimentary shuttle service as well however I don't mind waiting in the lobby area as I typically bring something to do.  I'm really glad that I found a great shop to bring my vehicle for maintenance work and will continue to come here.

This is one of the better finds that I have found near Mekong Plaza. The prices are very reasonable for what is offered and the portions are of decent size. I had some items from the AZ menu like the Chicken Broccoli & Fish Fillet and got to try the Mapo Tofu from the regular HK menu. The service could be improved however as it does take a while to sit down and order some food. Other than that though the food does come out quickly. There was an instance where after ordering some take-out from them I was waiting for at least 15-20 minutes, they realized that the ticket was left on the floor. It didn't bother me much since they seemed very busy that night and also I wasn't in much of a rush. At least they were very apologetic about the situation and offered me to grab a drink from the fridge free of charge.  I thought their Mapo Tofu was very good and the portions were larger than expected. The Chicken Broccoli was not too bad and I thought it was decent compared to some other places that I have been to. Fish Fillet could have been better but it was still satisfactory. Overall I would definitely make my way back there considering how great the prices are for everything.

After reading all the reviews on here I'm glad that I chose Classic Gold and would not hesitate to recommend them. I needed to have my front bumper replaced due to a minor accident on the freeway. Not only did they have the lowest quote out of all the shops that I went to but Mike was a very personable guy and was honest as to what the costs would be. Two days later I came back to pick up the vehicle and the front bumper looks as good as new. I also didn't realize how much wear and tear my old bumper had encountered so it was probably a good idea to get the bumper replaced anyway.  The customer service here was excellent. The ladies at the desk were helpful and had no issues sorting out a rental car for me while my vehicle was at the shop. I also had no idea that they also do regular car maintenance including oil changes so I'll probably come back here for that.

Value is the main word here when describing Bill's and that's not a bad thing to say at all!  Parking is easily accessible here and the location is central to most of the popular spots on the strip. I would say the atmosphere is very relaxed and not too pretentious compared to other casinos. With the minimums lower here for the games it's not hard to see why that is. They also offer $2 margaritas which is such a steal, it's tiny but strong enough to get the job done.

Located inside Planet Hollywood, the hype around this sandwich place got me curious in trying their hot sandwiches. I have to say that the hype is real and this place is amazing!  These hot sandwiches are some of the best that I've had. The lines go by quick as well, you first get a receipt then pay at the cashier at the end. So far I had the Hawaiian BBQ + Full Montagu and both were great solid choices. I'm really excited to try the other sandwiches when I get a chance.

I was really hoping that this Japanese restaurant would be better than expected, however I left not feeling that impressed. I came by on a Saturday night with two of my friends at around 9 PM and while we didn't mind waiting for a table, the person at the desk seemed a bit rushed and were asking us if we planned on having any drinks before sitting down at the table. The atmosphere was definitely on the trendy side as I saw a lot of younger folks. At times it felt difficult to make conversation just due to the noise levels.  My friends ordered sushi as well as an udon noodle soup. We thought that the sushi was about average and the udon noodle soup my friend liked. As for my order I got the chicken teriyaki dinner box which was average as well. It did take us a while to get our food and it was quite pricey for what we got. I really hope there are better spots in the Valley to get Japanese food...

I would say that Yo Pauly's is one of my favorite places in Scottsdale to get pizza delivered. My coworkers and I have ordered delivery on numerous occasions and it has been great each time. Though I enjoyed the garlic knots, the main attraction here seems to be the giant 24" pizza that they have on offer. My favorite would have to be the BBQ Chicken as I really liked the sauce they used on it. I also tried the Cheese Louise which was good as well.  I've always had a positive experience when it comes to delivery orders. From the person that picks up the phone to the delivery driver, each person has been very friendly and helpful. I would say that the customer service here has been excellent. Hopefully I can make it to their storefront sometime to check it out, that is if I'm not eating their awesome pizza already...

So I've noticed this restaurant for a while now after passing by it so many times but never had a chance to check it out so I was eager to see what it was all about. I was wandering around Mill Ave with my friends and we were looking for a place around midnight that was still open for food. Overall I'm happy to report that the Greek/Mediterranean food here was better than expected especially with the restaurant being open until the early hours of the morning daily.  The lady (owner?) was extremely nice and patient with us as we were trying to figure out what to order. I ended up getting the Chicken Shawarma Pita which was great and what made it especially good was that the meat was cooked to perfection. It was extremely tasty and adding the Tzatziki sauce was a nice touch.  I would definitely come back here again for late night food on Mill Ave and will recommend my friends to check it out as well if they're in the area. If I do end up trying some of their other offerings I will update this review accordingly.

To start off the new year I wanted to get my car detailed as it has been a while since I had any detailing done. After seeing all the great reviews here on Yelp I decided to try these guys out for the first time. Making an appointment with Scott was very easy and he was able to book me in at a short notice.  I had Scott's team come out to my residence and it was really quite convenient for me, definitely a step above other companies I have dealt with in the past where I had to go to them instead. It was a pleasure dealing with Anthony and Richard as they are very easy going and friendly folks. I briefly told them my expectations and in just about one hour they had my car all ready. After checking it out everything looked great!  Now I definitely know who to contact to get my car detailed now. My first impressions were really good and I would be hard pressed to go anywhere else now to get my car detailed especially with how convenient their service is.

My friends from NV talked about this place during my vacation stay, so I figured to give it a try and see how it is.  Honestly, this restaurant was just okay. They have a TV mounted on the wall with a good amount of seating inside. Something worth mentioning is they have this "all you can eat sushi" special for $25 and that's including a complimentary ice cream dessert. My two friends decided to go for this deal, but I decided to just get a regular entree instead. The prices are a little on the high side especially for the quality of the food. It's a decent restaurant but I would still look elsewhere if possible.

I was hungry late at night and wanted to see what was good around my neighborhood so I checked Yelp and came across Raising Cane's. After one experience with Raising Cane's I realize that I've been living in Las  Vegas for about a month now and only discovered this place just now?  Anyway I had "the box combo" seeing as how it was the most popular choice and I guess I can see why. To briefly sum it up I really liked the chicken fingers which are amazing when had with the Cane sauce. The fries were pretty good and there weren't overly salty or greasy compared to others that I've had. Coleslaw I didn't care too much for and lastly the Texas Toast was a nice touch to the meal.

So I went here on two separate visits and on each visit I tried something different. On the first visit I tried the platter which I thought was good overall with the exception of the Greek salad which I mostly skipped over. On the second visit I tried the chicken pita w/ fries and thought that was just okay. The chicken seemed a bit too dry and lacked flavor for me. I will probably have to try something else from this place as I have mixed thoughts about their food at the moment...  The customer service here is good. There is a lady at the front who seems to take good care of her regular customers. It was nice and refreshing to see that.

There's great food to be had here and I really like the broken rice plates. Located right in the Mekong Plaza, this is one of the better spots if you're looking for rice dishes. Keep in mind that they don't offer the traditional Pho noodle soup here but their other offerings are quite good. Normally I order take-out here though as the service can be spotty at times which does bring down the rating a little bit.  3.5 star rating rounded up to 4 stars.

I'm updating my review mainly because I come here almost every week so far. The main reason being that this is my favorite spot to get Vietnamese broken rice dishes. There might be better places in the Phoenix metro area but until I find a better spot I will continue to be a regular here. The people working at this restaurant probably recognize me by now and the service has actually improved over the past few months compared to my first visit when I initially came here.

What a great find thanks to Yelp. I just want to say that the customer service was excellent. They were a very friendly and helpful bunch of people to make the dining experience a positive one. As for the food, the broken rice plates were excellent from what I tried. The shrimp cake added a nice touch to the meal as well.

Originally I was not sure about coming here since I thought the name of the restaurant was gimmicky but this has to be one of the best places in the Phoenix area to get some Pho. I was pleasantly surprised about the quality of the noodle soups here. It seemed quite busy in there during my visit and the service did feel a bit rushed, but it doesn't bother me much as I was there just for a quick meal and I know how busy they can get at a restaurant like that. I plan to come back here to try out some of their other offerings!

Still keeping the rating the same, however I did try a rice plate here just out of curiosity and I wish I had the noodle soup instead. The portions were much smaller than I expected and the dish didn't include any fish sauce like most places, though I'm not sure if that's the norm here or not. Either way I will be back for the Pho.

Grand Lux Cafe is basically the Vegas version of The Cheesecake Factory and offers an array of different types of ethnic cuisine as shown on the menu. Speaking of the menu, there are SO many different choices to be made as I shifted through pages upon pages as if the menu were a small book. The portions of the food is rather large so keep that in mind if you have a group of people with you.  I came here with a friend of mine who was about to move out of Las Vegas and I wanted to go somewhere nice to eat for the both of us. The restaurant was not too hard to find and there was hardly any wait time to sit down at a table. I liked the interior decor of the Grand Lux Cafe, it was elegant but not too overdone. Both of us seemed to enjoy our entrees - I had the Chicken Parmesan and my friend had the Carolina BBQ Pork Sandwich. There were no major complaints from either of us with the food + service.  My Chicken Parmesan was a little more than half done, I guess they weren't kidding about the large portions. =)

With the restaurant being close to the strip and UNLV, I was a little surprised that it was relatively empty the times that I went. The lunch specials are such a good deal considering what you get for an affordable price (choice of entree, soup, and rice). The owners are really friendly and it's clear that they put a lot of effort towards the food and service.  It's good to know that I can get authentic Chinese food near where I live and the location is excellent. The only issue I have with the restaurant is that I wish parking was more accessible. From the times that I've been here so far, it seems like a toss up as to whether or not you get a decent parking spot near the restaurant. Other than that I do recommend Mr. Beijing as they really do cook up some great food daily!

I came back here to try their rice plate and have to say that it was quite disappointing along with the Pho that I had last time I was here. The pork when it arrived was a mix between warm and cold, honestly it was not that great as I have had much better in other places. With so many Asian restaurants in this immediate area I don't see a reason for me to come back here again, going to Mekong Plaza seems like a much better idea.

Apparently they closed for a few years and have just opened up again recently. I had a great first impression as the sandwiches here are actually quite good and they are open until early in the morning. Due to these reasons I plan on making Hangover Hoagies an option for late night food. The people running the sandwich part of the liquor store are extremely friendly and want to make sure that you wanted every possible ingredient on the sandwich. I do have to say that the location is a bit tricky as it's located inside the liquor store on the left side. There are also only a few small tables so I would highly recommend getting take-out for the food.  Honestly I'm surprised that this place is not more popular than it is, as long as you can find it of course.

After seeing this restaurant here on a few occasions while in the food court area I finally decided to try out this place mainly due to curiosity. This happens to be one of the few Filipino restaurants in the Phoenix area so I was excited to try it out.  I was not too sure what to get so for starters I decided to try out the BBQ Chicken. It came with steamed rice and I opted to get the steamed broccoli + carrots. The BBQ Chicken was very tasty and I would definitely go back to have that again. They also had a few items on their menu that I was curious about as well - mainly the garlic shrimp and some of the fish options.  I'm glad that there is a Filipino restaurant within the food court of Mekong Plaza.

Yup, this is pretty much as good as it gets on the strip if you ask me. The Cosmopolitan is my favorite casino and it's absolutely breathtaking! It's a good mix of modern & classy as you can see from the outside and the inside. I love the views as I go up and down the elevators and there is even a separate chandelier floor (floor 1.5) where they have a bar.  The drink service here at the casino is among the best that I've experienced, ever. The drinks come promptly and the cocktail waitresses are so nice and come around frequently enough. In other casinos the drinks come around slowly and makes me wonder if it's ever coming, not the case here.  Floor 2 is the location of the Marquee Nightclub, which is arguably one of the hottest nightclubs in Las Vegas right now. I've never been inside but I heard great things about Marquee. If you're into Electronic Dance Music (EDM) as I am, they have famous DJ's come and play here depending on the event.  Floor 3 they have a lounge area where you can play billiards for free which is an awesome deal if you ask me. I love hanging out here and playing billiards with the random people that I meet in this area. If you want a quick bite to eat there is a secret pizza place which is located in the narrow alley, they serve some awesome pizza. You'll just have to go there to experience it.  Out of all the casinos I've been to on the strip, this one really hits the nail on everything. Service has always been nothing short of excellent plus they offer free wireless internet here!

I would not consider D&B to be the best Chinese food I had...  My order was the combination lunch special with two items. Naturally I had the pork fried rice, chicken with broccoli, and sweet & sour chicken. The chicken with broccoli was actually decent and I liked the sauce they used for it. As for the other items they were uninspiring and I've had much better at local restaurants even.  Other than that my first impression was really bad on D&B so I probably won't be coming back anytime soon.

I was not expecting much from this Chinese restaurant seeing as how there were some negative reviews on here mainly about delivery it seems but I was pleasantly surprised with their food. The house special fried rice + broccoli chicken were actually great choices even compared to some of the other Chinese restaurants in the area. I believe their closing hours are actually until 10 PM on most weekdays despite the 9:30 PM closing time that's mentioned on here.  Never ordered delivery from here so I'm not sure what that's like but the pickup/takeout was very convenient for me. The prices are very reasonable and portions were generous. I would order from here again if I'm in the mood for some Chinese food.

The pho here is not the best that I've had, but it's most likely one of the best pho restaurants on Spring Mountain. I was born and raised in San Jose which is home to the largest Vietnamese population in the country so I have a good idea on what good pho is. The single most important factor is the broth which gives it the flavor, and I'm happy to say that Kinh Do has a great pho broth.  I don't care for beef too much, so I order chicken pho like I normally do and it has been great every time. The bean sprouts + basil leaves are fresh and those go well with the meal. Like I mentioned already, the broth here is awesome. The service could be better though...sometimes I have to flag down a waiter to get my water refilled.

This is definitely the best experience I had with airport parking. After parking my vehicle the shuttle came shortly after to pick me up going to the airport which is a complimentary service. After I came back from my trip there is a designated area for the shuttle van and luckily in my case the shuttle was already there so that made it really easy coming back from the airport.  They do run specials all the time at least from what they told me through Groupon and there are also plenty of ways to lower their parking rates. Also everyone that I have encountered here has been very friendly and that does make travel easier for me.

This is definitely some of the best NY style pizza I have ever had and you can find it here at the Cosmopolitan on the 3rd floor. Located next to the sushi restaurant, it's well hidden and literally a hole in the wall since there are no signs that direct to it. Once you see the pinball machine in the alley then you have found it!  Well it's a cool spot, they have two pinball machines at the front. The pizza is really great and they're open until 5 in the morning. This is one of the true hidden gems on the Las Vegas strip and the pizza is affordable which is great considering how expensive the food on the strip can be.  Highly recommended!

The original chopped salad is as good as people have made it out to be! It was simply fantastic especially with the presentation and all the ingredients of the salad blended very well together. I can definitely see why this is their most popular dish. The pork belly pastrami was very good as well and probably my second favorite after the chopped salad. Lastly, the chicken fried duck leg was not bad but compared to the other options I thought it was just OK.  I missed out on the happy hour unfortunately and didn't get any drinks on my first visit, however seeing as how I enjoyed the appetizers here I plan on making a return visit here to try out their drinks and of course to get the chopped salad again.

I have been here at least a few times mainly due to their wonderful reverse happy hour where most of the beers on their list are half priced. Just keep in mind that there are some beers that are not included in this happy hour but they do have a fairly extensive beer list so there's something good for everyone. This is one of the few places on Mill Ave that have reverse happy hour making this a great spot for a night out or to at least have on the rotation of places to go.  As far as the food is concerned I did share a pizza with a friend of mine and we found it to be just okay. I was more impressed with their pretzels, mainly the garlic butter + parmesan version. I feel the main draw to this place has to be both of their happy hours and at least their pretzels for the appetizers. Their garlic bread is something I would have to try on my next visit to see how that is.  Yes it can get busy here late at night but I suppose the vibe all depends on when you go. Despite it being busy here at times the atmosphere is for the most part "mellow" and this is a great place to hang out and have a beer.

So my friend from back home recommended that I check out The Habit which I found out is a popular burger chain. I decided to come here a while ago and to start off by ordering the #1 Charburger combo with fries and drink so I can find out what the hype was all about. All I have to say is that it was such a disappointment! While the burger was fine it was not anything out of the ordinary and the fries were lacking sadly. The only bright spot was that I decided to substitute the drink for a vanilla shake which ended up being a good decision on my part as the shake was quite good. The service I felt could have been better as well - people were friendly to me but didn't really seem encouraged to go the extra mile. It could have just been me as I was expecting a lot more out of everything here.  With so many other burger chains in the Phoenix metro I will probably give this a miss from now on. Sorry but I really expecting a lot more out of The Habit and left very underwhelmed.

This is an unassuming hole in the wall Mexican restaurant which I know are a dime a dozen around here but this absolutely has to be one of the better options out there. I can highly recommend both the fish and shrimp tacos as they were delicious! It's hard to even pick a favorite out of the two but I did prefer the fish taco just slightly more in my opinion. I would love to try their combo plates here next time. The people working here are really nice as well and it's awesome to see that there's a drive-thru option.  Out of the many options for Mexican food I'm glad that I tried this one. I'll be back again surely if I'm in the area.

The ice cream sandwiches here are very good and I can see why it is their signature item. I decided on two kinds of cookies for the sandwich which in hindsight I probably should have only gone with one choice. For only $2 this was an unbelievable deal and it was quite good. There's not much seating inside but as this place is quite small it would be better to eat the ice cream sandwich on Mill Ave instead.  The location is good on Mill Ave and the prices are great. I would like to come back next time to try their milkshakes as well.

I came here due to all the great reviews on Yelp and was not disappointed at all. Scheduling an appointment with Rick was made very easy and upon meeting with him he definitely will look out for your vehicle and offer you a brief but honest breakdown of the different tint options available. After some thought I eventually settled on the slightly more expensive SunTek option with 80% fronts and 35% rears. As my vehicle is registered in California I did want my window tints to be CA legal.  After around 1.5 to 2 hours my vehicle was all done. I have to say that the new tint job looks great and have had no issues with it after a few weeks of application! The price was very reasonable and I would like to thank Rick and his crew for the tint job on my vehicle.

The main reason why I decided on going to the Monarch Theatre was because of the DJ's that perform here that play the music that I enjoy, but other than that this was a fairly underwhelming experience for a nightclub. The drink prices are very high for a nightclub like this and the dance floor was extremely sticky (due to spilled drinks). What irritates me the most is how the music that is played here was so loud that you can feel the dance floor shaking and it's very difficult to make conversation with anyone unless you're outside or perhaps towards the back. The venue was also smaller than expected with no much room to move around.  Unless I'm here to see a DJ that I really like I don't see myself coming back here otherwise, if I do come next time I will bring earplugs most definitely.

I was delighted to see Raising Cane's near ASU as I have tried it before in Las Vegas and really liked the food. Normally I get either the box combo or the 3 finger combo depending on what I'm in the mood for. If it's your first time the box combo is a great sampler for their menu on what they have to offer. Given the proximity to ASU there are loads of college students that come through here but what I like is that they are open late which makes RC a great option for take out. As far as the food this is what I thought:  Chicken Fingers = Main reason for coming here in the first place. They are definitely above average and go well with the dipping sauce. Texas Toast = Nice and soft and I like the flavor. Coleslaw = It's just okay but goes well with the box combo meal. Nice to see some veggies though. French Fries = They are okay, just your average fries I guess. Keep in mind that they are crinkle cut instead of regular fries. Sauce = I'm a fan of the sauce but I do wish they have more choices of sauces in general, as this seems important for finger food.  Overall a great spot and despite being fast food I do like coming back here. The service is fast and the pricing for the combos is great value.

So after living in the Phoenix area for a few months I have never been to QuikTrip before and I'm glad to have finally checked it out recently. This is a super awesome gas station as well as a convenience store which is more like a small supermarket with how many items they sell in there.  The premises is kept very clean both inside and outside...simply adding to the appeal to stop over here for fuel and the store inside. Prices are also very reasonable as well and not as pricey as I had originally expected. I also noticed that the employees are very friendly and helpful which is something you normally don't see at most other stations.

These are some of the best tacos that I have had in a while. For those of you that are wondering these are most definitely authentic street tacos similar to the ones that I have had in Mexico. The beauty lies in the simplicity in their menu as the only two offerings are either chicken or steak tacos. They are only $3 each which is a phenomenal deal as long as you don't mind how there is no place to sit down with chairs and tables.  The location can be good or bad depending on the circumstances. I like how it's situated within the entertainment district however if I were to only come to this area for the tacos the parking situation can be a pain as usually the parking nearby is already taken. Other than that this spot is especially good for late night food as they are open late every day. Just beware of the crowds especially after 1-2 AM as there will definitely be a wait for these tacos.

It seems like there are a growing number of these ready to make pizza restaurants recently which is definitely not a bad thing! Although the pizza was quite good, the garlic knots were the real winner in my opinion and the marinara sauce included really complimented the garlic knots. The service was friendly especially the guy who was making my pizza at the time had a great attitude, forgot his name though.  If I didn't live so far from the location I would stop by more often, though I may have to try out the Tempe location sometime. They do have some deals going on every now and then so I'll probably come back at some point in time.

I'm really glad that I found this place to get hair cuts. I went maybe two weeks ago and made an appointment with Adam. Upon meeting with him you can tell that he's a very personable guy and puts in great care about running the business. I was able to effectively communicate what kind of hair cut that I wanted and the atmosphere is very easy going and relaxed.  After a great experience with getting my hair cut by Adam I will definitely go back next time and can encourage other people to try this place out in Tempe.

This has to be one of my favorite spots in Mekong Plaza. So far I have tried two sandwiches here and they are quite good. The Grilled Chicken sandwich was really good and I enjoyed the lemongrass flavor. As for the BBQ Pork sandwich it was just okay, maybe I was just expecting more though. The people running the shop seem very friendly and there's plenty of seating inside. I like to come here for a quick meal and the prices are very reasonable for the sandwiches.  If you like Vietnamese sandwiches (Banh Mi) definitely give this place a try. I was born and raised in California and the sandwiches here rival some that I have had in San Jose.

What a great find! After a few times of coming here I decided on getting the monthly pass and so far that seems to have been a good decision. This place is pretty good as far as automated car washes go - it doesn't take very long to go through the car wash and I like how they give you a damp towel to clean the interior of the vehicle. I usually keep some microfiber towels in my car so I can dry off the exterior of my vehicle and so far that seems to be working out well. They also provide complimentary vacuums for the carpets which is a nice touch.  The staff here are friendly and helpful, never had a bad experience here before so that's good. My monthly pass ends up to be $25 per month but if you go at least once a week it's definitely worth it.

I was showing my friend around Mill Ave and we were looking for a place to eat for dinner. With Zipp's being a sports bar I thought it would be somewhat similar to Buffalo Wild Wings in terms of the food and drinks. While the atmosphere was fine and it was nice to sit at the patio outside, the food had to be some of the worst that we had.  Both the fries and onion rings were extremely overcooked to the point where we could not even finish it. As for the chicken sandwich it was borderline inedible and it was a struggle to finish. My friend ordered a burger and ushered pretty much the same thoughts to me about his meal, He did finish his burger though but certainly not without a struggle.  The drinks were fine but it would not be worth coming back here due to the terrible food. I'm sure going to Buffalo Wild Wings would have actually been a better choice for the evening.

While the name of this restaurant is not exactly original - I did like my visit here. Main reason being that the lunch specials here are so aggressively priced it's very easy to come for a quick meal or order take-out. The lunch specials come with egg drop soup and wontons which were just okay but I did like the Cashew Chicken that I ordered. I'd like to try something different next time though if I make my way back here again. The service is just about non-existent but it doesn't really matter to be honest.

I really enjoyed the experience at Topgolf and would definitely go back again! Everything is still so modern and new since it was just opened last year. I arrived with my father and we decided to play two hours in the morning as it's much easier to get a bay in the morning vs. evening. Getting started was fairly easy although having to pay $5 to get a players card was a bit steep. There was a gentlemen that directed us to a bay on the 2nd floor.  We played a variety of different mini games and each one posted interesting challenges for us to overcome. I also saw the games room downstairs and that looked like tons of fun as well. It seems like a great place to go with a group of friends whether or not they are golfers it doesn't matter at Topgolf.

I tried two of their empanadas and while they were good - not sure if I will frequent this place often since it wasn't as filling as I thought. Even still it's a nice cafe with a great atmosphere and the people that work here are lovely. The Zuri Chicken empanada was great and everything I had hoped for, however I would probably skip on upgrading to a full meal which includes a drink and chips/coleslaw. The Dulce De Leche which is one of the dessert empanadas was decent but overall I would rather have ordered another one of their main empanadas that they have to offer.  With all that said though this is probably one of the best eats in Tempe Marketplace. Their lemonade is quite good as well if you ever get around to trying it.

I'm a bit surprised at all these negative reviews on here. I have been here on numerous occasions to get various sandwiches and never have had a bad experience here. All the sandwiches that I tried have been at least above average and the people helping you out at the counter have usually been very friendly and helpful. The location for me is excellent as it's on Hayden & Thomas, located in a strip mall with other restaurants as well.  Jersey Mike's is nothing fancy but it's a nice spot to get a quick bite to eat, and for that I'm a fan.

Believe the good ratings and reviews on Postino's. The Bruschettas are simply amazing - my favorite has to be the smoked salmon and pesto. I've been to this location and the one in Gilbert and I would have to say that this location is my favorite.  I came here for brunch on a Sunday morning to meet up with some people a little after nine. They arrived before me and apparently most, if not all of the patio seating outside had already been taken. If that doesn't speak for how popular Postino's is then I'm not sure what does. They have a good food list for brunch as well - ordered the Country Toast which was excellent with portions bigger than expected. As for their wines they are simply stellar. You can tell that they have an extensive tried and tested wine list and it definitely shows.  The service here is really good. The people working here are very friendly and helpful willing to give you suggestions on what to try. I really enjoy every visit to Postino's and I look forward to coming back!

So I happen to live across the street from this restaurant and they do open late until early in the morning which is definitely a plus. With that being said the food that I have tried here has just been okay so far. I did try a slice on the NY style cheese pizza and it was okay but nothing special. I thought the garlic and parmesan breadsticks were underwhelming as you can hardly taste the flavors at all, not to mention it was very greasy.  I did see quite a few people order take-out for a large size pizza so I may have to try that sometime (since they're open late). So far I haven't been too impressed with coming here though but I'm willing to try them again.

I only discovered Ike's recently on Mill Ave and so far it's been a great spot for sandwiches. The location is somewhat hidden away behind the Bank of America ATM but I did a see a sign on Mill Ave to direct people there. I would have to agree with other people in that the sandwiches here are delicious! I'm not sure if I would consider them to be the best but they're definitely up there. So far I had the Menage A Trois and Steve Nash and they have been phenomenal. Somehow I'm not able to stray away from the Halal chicken just yet but the other sandwiches sound really good as well so I'll definitely have to give them a try sometime.  While I really enjoyed the sandwiches here and would give them an easy 5 star rating there are some minor issues about the restaurant. I just wish that the seating area was bigger and the tables that are used are just too small. In any case I will still come back here as the sandwiches are really good. Definitely one of the best spots on Mill Ave by far.

Normally I would give 5 stars for a place like this. I really enjoy playing video games and have been every since I was a kid growing up. Their video game selection has many consoles available for use and the social interaction between other people has been really great. However the food & beverage side of things could still be improved on as I wish they had more food selection.  Still though this place makes for a great night out especially if you like video games. The fact that you can play video games for free here naturally merits a high rating however if you're not into gaming then there are plenty of other places out there that would be a better fit for a night out.

Making an appointment for Greg to come out to my residence was very easy and he was available the following day to restore one of my headlights. Greg arrived on time and was very friendly, not to mention he completed the job in a timely fashion. At $20 per headlight Greg has done a phenomenal job when it came to restoring one of my headlights as close to factory condition as possible. I can definitely recommend him for anyone who is looking to get their headlights restored especially with how convenient it was to make an appointment. In fact I was surprised at how easy the whole process was.

This was a nice off the beaten path option for pizza and drinks that I probably wouldn't have found on my own if I wasn't looking for Craft 64. I found the atmosphere very laid back as the bartenders and servers were friendly and helpful. After looking over the menu I decided on the pepperoni pizza and the "64" mule. While the pizza certainly was good it seemed too pricey for what was offered although I did enjoy their pizza crust greatly.  However, I really liked their "64" mule drink! It was definitely stronger than I expected and tasted great especially with my pizza. I can see why this is one of their signature drinks and would consider coming back here for the mules.

Despite being the only Malaysian restaurant I could find in the Phoenix area this was a very pleasant surprise! The owner was extremely friendly and gave me some recommendations on some dishes for my future visits. It's nice to see a Malaysian restaurant in Tempe that serves up great authentic food and I hope their business does well. Their food comes out fast as well and prices are very reasonable for what you get. I had the Char Kway Teow which was absolutely delicious and the pineapple juice was very good as well, although it was a bit too sweet for my liking.  I would like to try one of their rice dishes next time and will most definitely stop by here again soon.

I decided to get takeout from here before heading to work seeing as how Hogs & Hops is one of the newest additions to the Gainey Shops which has a nice collection of restaurants. Overall it was a bit of a letdown compared to what I expected. I ordered the BBQ chicken sandwich with fries which in retrospect I probably should have got the BBQ pulled pork but it doesn't matter too much either way. While the BBQ sauce they used is quite good and the meat seemed to be of good quality, the bread that they use for sandwich was terrible and did not hold well together with the BBQ meat which was very disappointing. Also the fries that I got as the side item was lackluster.  There are much better BBQ places elsewhere and I really don't see myself coming back here again.

There has recently been a crop of these restaurants in the Phoenix area as far as the make your own pizza concept goes. After having tried MOD Pizza and My Pie I still prefer Fired Pie the best. The main reason being that the toppings they use is of high quality and you can definitely taste the difference.  I would say that Fired Pie is one of the better, if not best option inside the food court right now. I've been here on a few occasions and the pizzas have been very good each time, with me slightly tweaking the options for toppings to get a different pizza. Best part is that you can get as many toppings as you want and it will still be at the same price.

So I heard about Portillo's from other people and would always pass by this restaurant as it's right near Tempe Marketplace. The atmosphere inside is very loud and busy which usually wouldn't bother me that much however the food was nothing special to compensate for that. I was thinking about getting the Chicago Dog before I came here however I decided to pass on that as I would rather try the Chili Cheese Dog instead. I also got the cheese fries as well which was a disappointment. As for the dog it was fine but I probably wouldn't get it again.  On another visit I did order the chocolate cake shake that a lot of people mentioned on here. Once again not really that impressed and the shake was more of a dessert instead of a drink. The shake was too thick for me to use a regular straw and I had to use a spoon in order to finish it. There are much better places in the area to get shakes.

I'm so glad I found this place to get Mexican food in the area. This is most definitely authentic Mexican - tried the 5 street tacos & 3 shrimp tacos both were extremely flavorful and tasty. I also liked how they had various options to customize tacos including a choice of sauces depending on how spicy. The art on the wall was cool and does add character to the taco shop.  This is an easy recommendation for good Mexican food in the South Scottsdale area. I plan on returning here on occasion and to bring my friends next time!

Finally decided to try out Queen Greek as I noticed the restaurant was located in the strip mall that I pass by on my daily commute. I'm so glad that I decided to give this restaurant a try as the food is absolutely amazing! There are a handful of Greek restaurants in the area and this one is by far my favorite. I really liked the Chicken Shawarma as the portions were great, food was extremely tasty from start to finish, and the prices are very reasonable for what is offered. I also tried their gyros which are very good as well. The food does a while to prepare so keep that in mind, however the wait is most definitely worth it!  I would highly recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for Greek food. As for me, I plan to come back here every now and then as the food is really great.

Tampopo Ramen has been on my radar for quite some time. I have been wanting to try this place out especially as I was craving ramen the other day. There was a little bit of a wait time for a table which was understandable as I went on a weekend. Their service could be improved however as I felt the wait staff was just running around and they never checked on me until I was done with my meal. I ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen which must have taken at least 20-25 minutes to arrive. While their noodles are very good being hand-spun noodles everything else was average at best. They use a hard boiled egg for their ramen soup whereas other ramen restaurants use a soft boiled egg which I prefer. The pork was extremely chewy, so much so that I couldn't even get myself to finish it. As for the broth it was flavorless and I had to even bring myself to use soy sauce. One positive is that their broth is not very salty which I suppose some people would prefer that instead.  I've had ramen in both LA/SF areas and while it would be unfair for me to compare the ramen here to the ramen shops in California I feel that there could be improvements made to their ramen soup here.

Came here on their grand opening day at around 6:10 PM and proceeded to wait in line and for my food to be ready around one hour later. I don't anticipate the lines to be that long going forward but either way there will probably be a wait for quite some time until more people try out Shake Shack. Anyway I have to say that I was fairly impressed with both the food and service. The people working here were super friendly despite the opening day rush and it was great to see people excited to try out Shake Shack for the first time.  After looking over the menu and what they have to offer I ended up deciding on the Shack Burger, Chicken Shack, Crinkle Cut Fries, and a shake. I know that was a lot to eat through in one sitting but I really wanted to try out as many of their offerings as possible. So far I would have to say that the Shack Burger was my favorite as the burger was of very high quality and it was everything that I expected. I was also impressed with the fries as the outside texture of the fries had a nice crunch to them that most fries don't have. The Chicken Shack was very good as well however I would still prefer to get the Shack Burger over it. Lastly, the shake was nothing too special and will most likely not get a shake next time.  I know a lot of people do compare Shake Shack with In N Out. In the end I do prefer Shake Shack for their burgers and fries however their prices are on the higher end which will deter me from coming here more often. While the burgers here don't look that big they were actually quite filling, so do keep that in mind before placing in the order.

I'm surprised about all the positive reviews for Blaze. So I did try the make your own pizza and it was disappointing compared to some of the other places around that have a similar concept. I've been to Fired Pie/MOD Pizza/My Pie and found Blaze to be at the bottom of the list unfortunately. With so many other places around including some that I haven't tried yet...I just don't see much that stands out Blaze from the competition. I do recommend Fired Pie as the toppings there are of better quality in my opinion, and I also liked MOD Pizza as they have a huge variety of topping choices. Blaze does have a good crust and they also have a gluten-free option I think if you ask for it.  Sorry but there are other better options for custom pies, however it was definitely worth a try to see how Blaze stacked up to the competition.
