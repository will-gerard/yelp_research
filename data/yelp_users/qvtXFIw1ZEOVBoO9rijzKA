I told some friends that I was going to take them for a Gelato experience to rival Italy (I've been, I know).  We drove from Central Phoenix, and the whole ride was consumed with them giving me a hard time about how far it was and how long it was taking.  When we pulled up, one of them said "I seriously doubt something named ANGEL SWEET is going to be the best gelato experience of my life!"  About 3 bites in she was changing her tune and has asked to go back no less than 4 times.    The proof is in the pudding (or rather gelato) here folks.  The flavors are consistently good, the gelato is made fresh daily in stores and the combo possibilities are endless.    Allergen info: Unlike the yogurt places on every corner, Angel Sweet has lots of dairy free options.  All their fruit flavors (with the exception of coconut) are dairy-free and taste fantastic.  If you are avoiding dairy, this is the dessert spot for you!  You will not be sorry you went.

I went to Atmospere originally because I needed a change and a friend had a free cut coupon.  I figured I'd give it a shot, and I am so so glad I did.  Jaime cut 10 inches off and gave me a cut I get complimented on all the time!    The salon itself has a great vibe and is always neat and clean.  The staff is friendly and helpful and even the stylists who don't cut my hair remember my name and say hi.  But, by far, the best thing about Atmosphere is that I get a fantastic cut every time.  Jaime is always asking for feedback and wants to make sure my hair looks great.    A haircut this great, in this fantastic an atmosphere, with such awesome staff is worth every penny.

You must go eat at Ticoz.  Really.  It's great.  I'm not kidding or exaggerating.  If you happen to have food allergies, things you avoid on principal, stuff you hate, or are just generally picky, this is the place for you.  Saturday night found me with two wonderful friends looking at a menu that was overwhelming.  The whole experience started much as every restaurant experience starts.  Greeting, seating, menus, panic attack.  The server (who was lovely, but who's name I cannot remember) came by to ask what we would like.  Given that all of us have some dietary challenges, we start throwing the questions at him.  He doesn't know the answers, but he vows to figure it out. Usually, this does not end well, see the open letter to our sandbar server.  We just get back to our conversation when chef Holly appears at our table.  Everything on the menu is her brainchild and she knows exactly how to answer every one of our questions.   Not only did Chef Holly answer our questions, she created an entirely new dish for one friend (it was incredible), whipped up a lemon apricot vinaigrette salad dressing with enough for leftover containers, and took back my chicken when it came covered in parsley.  All this is impressive, but what made the experience incredible was her attitude.  It was obvious that she was excited about food.  She saw the challenge in creating something for us.  She told us that no one has ever gotten sick from her food and she was going to make sure we weren't the first.   In the end, all the service is amazing, the atmosphere is wonderful, and the staff is great.  But the food is incredible!!  This is pretty important, since we were there for the food.  All around, this was an awesome experience.  So, go to Ticoz.  Chef Holly will take care of you.

"Gourmet"  is used loosely here.  If your meat is all pre-cooked and they just toss it on the grill to warm it up, can you really say you're gourmet? I'm pretty sure that's what Mickey- D's does, and no one is claiming they're gourmet.  I could probably get over that fact if it weren't for a horrible interaction I had with one of the employees regarding their bread.  When walking into Forefathers, they have a sign declaring that what makes the sandwiches they serve better than any other is the bread.  Turns out, they don't make the bread in the store.  Ok, I can get on board with using a local bakery to make your bread.  What I cannot get on board with is the fact that they have no idea what is in the bread they serve, nor do they have any interest at all in finding out!   My allergies to dairy and eggs make it difficult to find bread that I can eat.  When I asked the lady at the register if their bread had dairy or eggs she said she didn't know and couldn't find out.  Ok, I'll have a salad and I'm fine with that.  The issue came when I suggested that she may want to ask the bakery next time she talked to them as food allergies are becoming more common.  She said no she didn't think she would do that and that I was the only one who had ever asked.  WRONG answer! It is an insult to gourmet eateries everywhere to not know exactly what is in everything you serve.  If the bread is really what makes the sandwich, why don't you know what's in it.  I, for one, will not be returning.

This Yogurtology location is apparently owned by someone who does not understand the concept of meeting customer demands.  They have had the same dairy-free flavor for months on end.  I keep getting suckered into going in there with friends and I am always disappointed.  The one dairy free flavor they carry, isn't good!  I have asked for a new flavor and told them they would get more dairy allergy business if they were to carry more/ better options, but the last time I was in there I was informed that the owner's favorite dairy-free flavor is the one they always carry and he refuses to change it.  Hope he likes that flavor more than he likes my business.  Especially now that there is a Nami in downtown, I will certainly not be making the decision to go to Yogurtology ever again!

Dear Server at the Sandbar,  "Yes" is the correct answer to the question"does your guacamole have cilantro in it?"  Your answer "no it totally doesn't", along with the lighting that rendered me unable to see said guacamole, led to me waking up the next day with eyes swelled shut!  Thanks for that.  Also, and this is just a bonus tip, if a customer outright tells you they are allergic to cilantro, you might want to ask the kitchen not to sprinkle it over EVERYTHING ON THE PLATE! You see I, the customer, am blissfully unaware of what the kitchen uses to garnish plates.  You, the server, should not be!  So maybe you could hook a sister up and ask them to leave it off.  I did, after all, tell you I was allergic to it less than 2 minutes ago.  This might help with your tips.  With warmest regards, and no bitterness whatsoever, Steph
