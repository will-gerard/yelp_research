First and Foremost GO THERE NOW!!!! Can I give it 6 stars?  Every bite was PERFECTLY cooked and the flavor was Amazing!   Went with 2 friends, we had the pork tenderloin (moist, the cheese added flavor and a perfect combination of textures), Alaskan Halibut (Flakey, not fishy had shrimp and a relish on top that make it truly unique and wonderful) and Lamb Shank (favorable, not gamey well seasoned).  We started with the Brie plate, so good, couldn't stop eating it.  We ended with a chocolate tarte, usually the desert is always my favorite. Desert was good but couldn't out do the amazing meal we had.  The service was PERFECT, we went on a Friday night.  The owner was there and charmed the pants off of every guest. I can't think of a time I had better food or better service. I'm in love with this place!  I love risotto, the waitress brought out a side with our meal to try it. The risotto was so good and so well cooked and seasoned. How do they get everything so perfect?  Cost was 52.00 a person with tip included. I have spent way more per person and not had the food be this perfect.   Go go go go go!!!!

First time there. Everyone was VERY friendly.  Not the fake nice.. the actually really nice type of people.  Got a facial with Ana.  She was great, felt so GREAT!   Everything was well explained and the service was top notch.  Was hard with 3 days notice to get all the services I wanted to get done booked; settled with a 60 min facial. Would love to try the hot stone massage or the 90 min massage next time.  I will be back!

I have high maintenance bulldogs and things always come up.  The vet I used normally was out of town and one of my dogs needed medical attention.  I consider myself very knowledgeable about my breed and I have used many Vets in the past.  Dr. Florez was very patient and knowledgeable.  He was able to treat the problem we came in for and point out a few tips on how to treat other issues I hadn't even considered.  The staff was very warm and friendly.    The office is beautiful and very well taken care of.  My bill was 50.00 less than it would have been with my other vet and I left with more knowledge.  I also took a look at their boarding.  I'm so impressed.  I will definitely be back.  Thank you everyone for taking such good care of my baby!

I've been to Vitos about 4-5 times.  I live 45 mins away... Totally worth the drive.  The bread and zucchini are my fav way to start my meal.. DON'T eat too much because the food is going to make u so full!  The Deep dish pizza is to DIE for... I admit to being a food snob.  I believe in using good ingredients and creating flavors that you can't get in every other pizza shop.  VITOS is KING!!!!  They make their own sausage, sooo good, and their sauce isn't too sweet from the basil.  Their crust has some sweetness to it; it is not over powering or distracting to the food.  The sweetness creates a balance to the overall pizza.  The texture is PERFECT!  I'm making myself hungry.  Really, this place is a BIG surprise!  You will love it!  FYI: BYOB, if u want soda or Iced tea they got u covered!

Wow! Awesome place. Soo cute and unbelievable service. Brought my dog in. The owners were in the front. They walked me though their options. I chose to wash my own dog. They have the best smelling shampoos and sprays. Even a pet dryer. We cleaned ears and brushed  teeth!!!  They had aprons so I could look clean when I left too! Ha ha  Best is they have top food and it's way cheaper than PetsMart and I can get a free bag!! I LOVE this place!!! Kinda didn't want to leave. They need chairs for people to sit and visit! Lol

My boy Sonny past away unexpectedly.  I was a mess. Mary opened the doors after hours, she was so gentle with my boy, and so kind to me and my husband. She has so many options to remember your pet, and offers you options, but doesn't push you into anything. She held on to Sonny for a few days for us to decide what we wanted our next step to be. Mary was so compassionate, and she took wonderful care of boy Sonny. I am so thankful for Mary, its hard for most people to understand how much he meant to us, Mary was professional and very sensitive to our needs.

This nail salon USED to be the best.  They have gone way down hill.  I never minded the overpriced services because they were nice and clean.  Their service is TERRRIBLE now.    I had an appointment for a mani pedi.  I came in and was ignored for about 4 mins then I was yelled at from one of the nail tables what I wanted. I explained I had an apt. They ushered me to a "massage" chair being filled with water.  Water was cold. "massage" chair didn't work.  I attempted to get someone to help me. The manager sat on his phone the entire time (usally hes on his laptop).  Finally my girl came to do my toes and I explained that the chair didn't work and the water was cold.  SHe turns the water to the hottest setting and leaves again. By the time she comes back the water is scolding hot. WTH????  Finally she got the manager to fix the chair by plugging it in. Honestly, I can't take their terrible service and high prices. Two thumbs down.

Ordered Pizza for pick up. They gave us OLD pizza. Must have been sitting for at least an hour. Awful terrible pizza!!! Called to complain. They could care less. Last time I get pizza from them.  They should be embarrassed!

Great food and Good service. Our first time.. told her it was our first time. Would have loved some recommendations. That's okay I read the reviews before I came. Food was very good, mashed potatoes have a different but great flavor. This is a good solid place to eat, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.

Every year my husband and I compete to see who can take the other to the best place for thier birthday dinner.  We have been to all the top places in AZ and I was excited to add Orange Sky to the list.    We got a private booth - I timed it at sun set.  The private booth gives you a sofa like bench facing the window to watch the sun setting, with curtains on both sides.  Very private, romantic and breath taking.  The food is good quality food.  It's not the best meal I have ever eaten but it was very well cooked and tasted great!  This is a perfect place to go to WOW someone, especially someone special.

Second visit.  Came in and saw the "seat urself" sign.  We sat down with a view of the Bar TVs.  The Bartender made eye contact at least 3 times.  Wait staff made eye contact twice... After 10 mins or longer my husband got up from our table and went to the bar.  He got our drinks and asked the Bartender if he was to order our food at the bar.  Bartender said, "sure, what would u like?"  Husband told him he would go back to our table with a menu and take our order for him. (What is going on here??) Finally the Bartender advised there was a waitress and he would send her over to us.  Did they think we came to their restaurant to watch their TV's and not eat or drink?  Waitress wasn't much help.  Husband had to go to the bar for a refill.  Then she over charged us for the beer, stating she was unaware they were on special (it was the last hour before close).  I can say the food has been good both times we went there.  The service the second visit was absurd.  They must not need our money.  I don't see them staying long with that service.  Oh and FYI we Facebooked our concerns to them, they deleted our post.  Classy!

First time - They asked if we had been there, guess the confussed look gave us away.  They brought sample cups; gave us a few samples each; walking us though the process. They were exceptionally nice and didn't make us feel like dummys. LOL  Great service! I got strawberry yogurt with fresh strawberrys and kiwi. SOO good!

Where to start...  Brent is not only a great lawyer, he's a great person.  I had a complex case that I felt was useless to fight.  How could the little guy ever win against a large corporation.  Brent came up with a very smart strategy for me and gave me all of my options.  I appreciate how Brent is always available.  I never felt like I didn't know what was going on.  He is well organized and had great recommendations for services I needed.  I have never felt so well represented and I felt that Brent was on my side and had my best interests in mind.      I strongly recommend Brent and Kleinman Law Firm.  I have already recommend him to several of my friends.
