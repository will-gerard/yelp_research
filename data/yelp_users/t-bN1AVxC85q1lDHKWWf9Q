I moved here from Dallas and per my parents' recommendation, decided to take my dog, a blue heeler mix named Harper, to Dr. Bracken at Arcadia Animal Clinic. There were a bunch of shots I needed to get my dog up to date on and so I brought her in. After talking with the doctor, I realized that she did not need to get some of them because there were requirements of dogs in Texas that were not requirements of dogs in Arizona. I feel like many vets would have taken advantage of that and administered the shots anyways to get the money, but Dr. Bracken ended up saving me that money. Additionally, I asked for recommendations on teeth cleaning chews and he gave me two bags of teeth cleaning bites and a cleaning kit for free to see how Harper liked them. It's about 45 minutes from my house, and there are plenty of places I could go instead, but I don't plan on going anywhere else.

AMAZING black jack dealers! But the WORST WORST WORST craps dealer I have EVER had in the ten years I have been coming to Vegas. The terrible craps dealer we had was named Fox, so if you have him STAY CLEAR. All he is interested in is getting his "quota" rolls in, but is INCREDIBLY rude. NOT worth it. Trust me. The manager on duty was GREAT, but not enough to make up for the bad experience we had with him. And all of this is coming from someone who spent THREE hours playing black jack at the SAME CASINO. So rude.

I really liked a lot of things and really didn't like one thing. The prices are unbeatable which is great. I also brought in two bridesmaid dresses, one fully beaded, and they did a great job with them. Unfortunately, I also brought in a Michael Kors dress that had a tassle on it that was completely ruined...they tried to fix it but it definitely does not look the same so I'm sad about that :(

Very cool atmosphere--completely different than the typical bar scene in Tempe. I think I've only had the pizza and it's really tasty and of course I liked the beer! I'm a wheat beer girl and it's pretty good here.

This is a pretty hipster bar so I feel a little out of place sometimes, but I love the food and patio. I'm a big oyster fan and these are the best I've found in the Phoenix area...and the patio is huge! The rest of their food is pretty good too and teh drinks are pretty standard.

I grew up going to this place and I've always loved it. I purchased the Bob and Cha Cha margarita glasses that allow me to get discounted margaritas every time I go. Their chips and salsa is the main reason I go--I think it's the best in the valley! They also just added these rolled tacos to their menu which I plan on getting every time now-they are so good! Additionally, I have never had trouble getting a parking spot.

Care more about taking advantage of their customers and getting all the money they can out of them than actually serving them and their needs. Will not be back.

An update to my review. I decided to use a credit I had for glasses and lenses and when I went in after my appointment was told I could just use it for just lenses. Now I just called to schedule that to change my glasses lenses out and they are not sticking to that word. They are saying I HAVE to purchase glasses, even though I already have glasses and now the credit is worthless to me. Obviously there are communication issues with throughout the company which is unfortunate for customers because they are getting told different things and receiving very poor customer service as a result. $125 credit down the drain.

People seem to be complaining about the service, but my boyfriend and I always get food to go from here and it's very tasty! It's one of our dinner go-to's when we can't decide what we want to do. Pretty good prices and big portions--we usually get pad thai and papaya salad, or some combo of a noodle and salad dish. I will continue to go here.

I don't go here for regular grocery shopping because it's so expensive. But they do have awesome homemade dips (love the spinach dip!) and amazing catering!

I've been here a few times...every time I came out my eyebrows looked great. One time though the thread literally broke probably 20 times while the lady was doing my eyebrows, which was annoying. They still turned out good though.

I love this place! It reminds me of Texas. Their tacos are always yummy and so are their margaritas! I just wish they salsa wasn't as chunky and they gave you more queso than a tiny little bowl when you order it. My boyfriend does the iPhone rewards program and both of us have gotten free t-shirts out of it so that's cool (and shows you how much we go...)!

I've been going here for about a year now and usually come about 1-2 times a month before weekends I go travel. Both people who have tanned me do a great job and I'l continue to come here!

I really love this place! Grimaldi's used to be my go-to wood fire pizza place, but I think this place has replaced it! The bruschetta, salad and pizza were all great! The people that work there are also super nice. I'll be coming back many times!

This is my favorite bar to come to in Scottsdale because it's trendy but still plays country music, which I love! The couple of times I've been with a table have been significantly better because it can tend to get really crowded in there and the line can get really long (and if you have a table you dont' have to wait). I always have a great time when I'm here--I just wish they had a bigger dancefloor!

I like a little more of an ambiance, but the food was good and the wait staff was very nice. I would recommend coming here if you want good sushi but don't care about the scene.

Love this place! Great brunch and atmosphere. The brunch deal is an entree and a mimosa or beer for only $10! Next time I go, I'm bringing my dog because it's very dog friendly! They had treats so I brought one home to my pup :)

I like this place a lot and it's a really nice location. My favorite things I've gotten on the menu, which also happen to be healthy options are the bbq chicken salad and the green chili pork bowl. Both really yummy and highly recommended. My boyfriend wasn't as big of a fan of the salad as I was though. The salsa is okay...I wish it was better because i'm a huge salsa person...but I liked the chips! I'd recommend this place for sure.
