No issue with the food. The service however was?extremely lacking. 5 people in the place but only one kid making the orders one at a time. Nothing was "hot & ready" I even called to order a deep dish pepperoni ahead of time. 8 minutes should be ready. 10 minutes later I arrive and still had to wait 10 more minutes. Not unhappy with the food just the slow service. Hope they can find a way to keep more product available and speed up the pace.

My wife and I had never left our dogs with anyone besides our family. We have known Kimberly (owner) for many years but had not used her services until this past weekend. I would not use anyone else again when needing a pet sitter. She treats your pets like family and not once did we worry. We got an awesome little photo update and card with treats when we arrived home. If you ever need a pet sitter in Maricopa this is the premier business to use!

Dr. Ken has been helping keep my family healthy for a few years now. From adjustments, trigger point injections, general medical care (cold,flu etc.) to pain management and therapy from various combat sports injuries. Dr. Ken and his staff will treat you with the utmost respect and care.

The shop is clean and staff was helpful and friendly. Especially good since my wife and I are novices when it comes to firearms. The shooter packages they offer are fairly priced and staff was more than willing to explain things while not making us feel totally green. I will be going back in the future for sure.

I've had chronic neck & shoulder pain causing pinched nerves and almost unbearable constant pain. For almost 2 months I had no relief using chiro adjustments, massage, grastons & trigger point injections. While these treatments would help, it was only temporary. After seeing OSS I had considerable relief after the first visit. The combination of dry needling , electro stim, cupping along with stretches and strength work has removed pain and pinched nerves. Twice a week for 2 weeks and I was amazed at the results. I'm finally back to training jiu jitsu at a normal pace thanks to them. If you're on pain or broken go see this crew. You won't be disappointed.

My family and I have been training at Lopez Martial Arts for close to 4 years. The instruction given by Chris Lopez is second to non. If you're looking to train traditional martial arts, Brazilian jiu jitsu, or kickboxing in a relaxed ego free family friendly environment this is the place. Come in and check it out.
