Placed on order online because I had a coupon for a free medium 1 topping pizza with any $12 online order - excellent deal.  Walked into the store to the overwhelming aroma of raw sewage and a lovely pulsing beeping. We had to wait a few moments for help. The first employee was a bit curt, informing us the other employee would need to ring us up. He comes out, gets my info, has me sign, and makes a joke about how he thought my pizza wasn't ready but remembered that I placed it "a long time ago."   I placed it 30 minutes ago. The website said it would take 30 minutes.   We raced out of the store to escape the assault on our olfactory and auditory senses. Get home, open the pizzas, and find one pizza was double cut into miniature slices and the other wasn't cut at all. The one that wasn't cut was also missing the ranch crust that was ordered. Oh, and if you couldn't guess, it was also cold.  I will thoroughly avoid this location in the future.

Let's start with the chips and salsa. They give you normal crispy chips AND decadently fluffy tortilla chips with a really fresh salsa. Super duper tasty!  Now, I can't remember what I had the first few times I came here but I know I was blown away. However, the only thing that matters anymore are the spinach enchalads. They are served with a incredibly flavorful red sauce and then topped with another white sauce and get this - TOASTED ALMOND SLICES. Yes, toasted almond slices. These lil' babies add the most insane texture to the creaminess of the cheese and spinach filling. I would love to have a plate of these right now - at 8:03am. The rice and beans are also excellent.  I can't speak to the alcohol selection too well but I did have a non-alcoholic prickly pear margarita and it was rather scrumptious. I was assured the one with alcohol was just as tasty and you get a ridiculous sucker in the shape of a cactus.  My only complaint is the service can be hit or miss. Last time I went was father's day around 1 or 2 and the place wasn't very busy. Our server was a bit of an airhead (and rather squeaky but that's not their fault).

Never a disappointment here! I will admit I haven't gone for some of the more "gourmet" flavors like anything with cheese or other savory ingredients. However, my summer favorites are a mix of any two fruity sorbets especially the melon or pineapple and the strawberry buttermilk when it's in the case. I recently went for a scoop of melon and a scoop of the lemon basil and it was the perfect treat after a miserably warm day. Some of my other favorites are the salted butter caramel and cinnamon. Don't forget the waffle cone with the surprise chocolate at the bottom!   Only bummer is they don't use animal free gelatin. Oh well, I don't really need those delicious and pillow-y looking marshmallows anyway.

I've been coming here since the place opened as I work right across the parking lot. The food is always excellent and fresh. The owner and staff are some of the nicest people you will ever encounter.   Some favorites: ground beef burrito, blackened chicken salad, fish tacos, and the breakfast burritos (they are massive and filling and everything you could possibly want). Oh, and the sopapillas. Don't ever forget the sopapillas. Pillowy little bundles of cinnamon and sugar with honey if you want. Delicious.  Yes, they take a little while for lunch but it's all made right before your lil' eyes.   Red sauce is awesome, green is tasty, and the habanero sauce has a good flavor without cooking your face.  These guys also do catering and deliver!

Was headed towards a bad decision lunch at Panda Express until I decided I should really give this place a try. There wasn't a solid vegetarian choice for lunch so I opted for the Teriyaki Salmon. Order that - $10.95 and 15 minutes. Grab my bag and head back to the office. Open it up to see a chunk of salmon atop of pile of soggy cabbage, a lump of white rice, a small green salad, a scoop of potato salad, and a dumpling of some sort. There's a separate container with a few pieces of vegetable tempura.   Salad was tasty but warm, potato salad was weird...there might have been cucumbers in there, the salmon was overcooked and dry, and I didn't eat the dumpling since it appeared to have chicken. The tempura was rather tasty but nothing extraordinary.   I'd recommend they lose the potato salad, fill that space with the tempura, and put the green salad in the separate container. Hot green salads are a bummer on top of a "eh" meal.  I doubt I'll be back. Steamed vegetables and chow mein at Panda would have probably been a better choice...

I wanted this place to be an amazing vegetarian stop but I was extremely disappointed. I picked up a falafel wrap and a veggie/hummus plate. Was told the veggie plate would take about 10 minutes which struck me as a little odd (how long does it take to saut√© some vegetables when there is no one else in the restaurant?) Well, when I got home I realized why. The vegetables had to be defrosted. There is no way what I got was fresh. Squishy broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots. Dreadfully bland too - it looks like they might have dusted them with paprika but seriously lacked in flavor. The red pepper hummus wasn't particularly interesting either (though the olive oil they drizzled on top was delicious!).   The falafel was tragic as well. A pita overfilled with tzatziki that was too thick and 4 extremely uniform falafel patties. I assume they were also prepackaged because they were super dense and all I could taste was the frying oil.   Bottom line - nothing seemed fresh or "home made" which is a total bummer. My search for decent falafel west of the 17 continues!

Jillian is an artist first and foremost. She doesn't cut corners and she doesn't skimp on the quality of products she uses. I've been seeing Jillian for close to 10 years (...woah) and have never walked away disappointed. She will consult with you before ever starting your service and will provide advice for both at-home and in-salon treatments if you have any issues or self-induced damage (don't bleach your own hair, kids). She wants you to feel fantastic and look fabulous. Grab some business cards on your way out because people will stop you and ask who does your hair. Seriously.  I've also had my nails done a few times (gel manicures) and they always look perfect, are creative (ask for fire paper, trust me), and last for weeks. Other ladies in my family have had full acrylic sets and we all have the shared experience of our nails still being relatively healthy when the gel/acrylics come off since she doesn't file your nails down too low (I'm looking at you cheap salons) to the point they are damaged before anything even goes on them. Acrylics are always custom built and sculpted by hand which is a super cool process to watch.  PS: Her prices are amazing given her skill level and attention to detail.
