The Brake Shop has always been fair to me and they're always extremely pleasant and easy to work with. Won't go anywhere else!

One of the best spots for tacos and margaritas, or a low key spot to grab a beer. I haven't heard of this location closing, I spent Halloween here - great times, as always.

I love this place! I've visited twice and selected the (lemon?) pesto with chicken both times. Delicious!

I visited the vet on Monday after my 6 week old kitten, Stella, had been sick all weekend. I knew something was wrong with her as she was throwing up and wouldn't eat. I waited 30 minutes and the vet proceeded to examine her and tell me nothing was wrong with her! I spent almost $100 here for them to test her blood sugar levels and give me no feedback. They sent me home with some food and a good luck. 24 hours later, yesterday, my baby died in my arms. How can a vet tell a pet owner that nothing is wrong with very little concern or help. I'm completely heart broken. Thanks for nothing.

I love this place for sushi and drinks! Friday and Saturday nights are usually pretty busy but any other night of the week is great! They have an awesome happy hour, too!

The best dive bar in town! Please don't come here if you're looking for an upscale bar with good drink selections. However, if you're a local looking for a spot to hang out with good friends ANY night of the week - this is your place!

This food is the closest traditional Italian food that I've had ( after visiting Italy, it's hard to find a spot to live up to my expectations). The owner is very pleasant and has fulfilled all of our requests during every visit, but a greeting upon arrival takes a bit of time...The wait is worth the food, however!

One of my favorite spots! Whether you're looking for a spot to hit for taco Tuesday ( be forewarned about the crowds) or somewhere to go for awesome drinks before hitting the town, Fuzzy's is your place. I love their beer-a-rita's, especially the morning glory - mini champagne bottle in a GIANT glass of frozen strawberry/lime margarita mix (I substitute the lime with pina colada flavored).

The burgers are awesome and the sweet potato tots are even better! They do not have a very good beer selection and my burger always seems to come out overcooked (I request medium rare, always). But I will continue to visit, nonetheless.

I have been dying to visit this place again! The burger I had late one night was fantastic. They also have a great selection of whiskey. What a surprising hidden treasure!

I wish I could write a better review, however, after living here a year and a half - I'm afraid I've only seen it go downhill. I moved into Riverview Park Apartments (the sign out front says Riverview Condominiums, now) in May of 2014... It was great! My roommate and I were so excited to move into our two story townhouse with new carpets and renovations. We were satisfied with the location, price and overall appearance of the community. Jennifer was the community manager, at the time, and was very friendly! However, as the months went by, things started to get a little worrisome. I was attached by a woman that comes into the community to feed the feral cats, in March of 2015. Details are not necessary, but long story short, this woman was trespassing and decided to get physical with my after I tried to shew the cats away from my apartment. At this point we had a new community manager, Ashley. I contacted her in regards to the incident (there is ABSOLUTELY NO security on the premises), she simply sent me an email back sending her regards to the situation and that she would follow up. A few weeks later, my car was vandalized - key marks up and down all sides of the doors and hood. I sent Ashley pictures, she said she would get right on it and contact management. A few weeks later (and a brand new car later), I still hadn't heard anything and my NEW car had been vandalized, too. I still wasn't getting any feedback from Ashley or higher management. Ridiculous...   Fast forward several months to June. I had a new roommate move in with me and explained to her the situation upon signing the lease. We continued to contact Ashley about the "attacking" incident and the cat lady that was still coming onto the property, several nights per week. Nothing was ever done. Security was never added, except for "no trespassing" signs (which haven't done much since in regards to the cat lady, misc people wandering through the complex or other random homeless people searching threw trash bins outside). Fast forward, again, to fall of 2015...There was a shooting in one of the apartments (someone was KILLED) and we were never informed - I found out through an online news posting. Ashley told us that she didn't think it was necessary (!!!!!!).   January 2016, we have yet to see any improvements in security or trespassing or communication with any form of management, on top of all this, my bike has been stolen. To say I am furious would be an understatement. My roommate and I should not have to worry about our belongings being stolen or vandalized and we most definitely should not have to worry about our own safety in the community we live in. Our lease is up in May, however, I wish we could move away sooner. PLEASE for the sake of your own sanity and security DO NOT MOVE into this complex.

Great little dive spot in north Scottsdale with an amazing selection of beer - there food isn't too bad either! Only downfall are the random comedy/metal shows they do here occasionally.

One of my favorite dive bars! I love the bartender Erin and Shane is cool too. The food is good and the beer selection is always great! I've always had nice experiences here and will continue to come back.

I love Q! I've been going here off and on since I was 19. Definitely the spot to get your nails done.

I really enjoy this place when I need something quick and healthy. It has a nice selection of seating and delicious food. Great spot for a pre-movie lunch. My only negative comment is their prices. They're a bit expensive and you can't add anything extra without the price increasing. However, their selection of "natural" sodas and awesome tea is great!
