This has become my go-to nail salon.  The prices are reasonable (especially for Scottsdale) and they always do a great job.  I am easily able to call for a same-day appointment and get right in when I get there.  Love the great selection of both gel and regular nail polish.  My gel manicures last for 3 weeks, and then I come back for a new one. Love this place and glad it's a part of my nail routine!

Love this place.  Great beer, fun atmosphere, and good food as well.  They have a good menu with some interesting items that you don't find just anywhere.  My favorite appetizer is the spanakopita... yum!  You can't go wrong with a brewery with good beer that serves good food as well.  Their Kilt Lifter is by far the best I've tried, and they serve up some good seasonals as well.  Looking forward to visiting this place again and again!  Great place to watch the game.

We love this place! I just wish we lived closer to it. This is becoming a standard hangout for my boyfriend and I, as we are total beer snobs. And this place fits the bill. Great pizza, but the reason you come here is for the beer! Not only do they make great beers (Coconut Joe and Orange Blossom, oh yeah) but their tap selection changes frequently and you can always find something good and usually something new to try. We love coming here to see what's new. I got a Papago beer club membership for Christmas, so I will definitely keep coming back!

Really liked this place.  It's a big place, with plenty of outdoor seating as well.  I love the Irish pub feel, although the outdoor pub facade in a strip mall was kind of weird.  Old pub feel inside, with some decent happy hour and reverse happy hour specials, good food, and good beer on tap.  Plus I live right around the corner.  Will definitely be back!

I haven't written a review on Yelp in a while, but I felt this place warranted one. The prices here are right on some things... Like the movies. The prices are about the same as a regular movie theater. The food is priced about the same as a restaurant. But the drinks are way overpriced. I ordered a peach shandy "beer cocktail" at the bar and it was $12. Yikes. I considered ordering another drink later but the prices talked me out of it. $5.99 for a Bud Light? No thanks. But the worst thing was the service. Someone came over to take our order the minute we sat down so of course we weren't ready. We should have been because it took probably 15 minutes after pressing the button to get a server. Then another 20 minutes to get our food. We were almost halfway through the movie before we got anything. When I finally did get my food, the salsa was pretty spicy, and my drink that was gone by that point. So I pressed the button again. At least another 10 minutes before I got a server and another 5 before I got the water. Everything just took forever. And then the movie ended and we hadn't gotten a check. We easily could've walked out without paying but we didn't. We paid at the bar. Seriously... This is a great concept but the service needs a LOT of improvement.

Great happy hour specials on sushi!  I love it that they have reverse happy hour every day of the week as well.  Their sushi is awesome too.  Great place to go after a movie.

This place was a horrible experience.  The prices were good during happy hour for typical bar food, which didn't taste bad, but made both myself and my boyfriend sick later.  We were there during Phoenix Open weekend, so of course they were busy, but they should know how to handle that.  We waited and waited for our check and had to flag down our waitress to get it.  Then, once we did, we waited 20 minutes and she never returned to collect it (we were paying with a credit card).  There was a guy coming around to collect dishes, so we asked him if he could take it and said our waitress hadn't been back in quite a while and we needed to go.  His reply, and I quote - "Well, she's probably got a lot of f***ing sh** going on."   Wow.  He did take our check, and the waitress brought it back.  Come to find out, this guy was one of the owners!  How can you talk to your customers like that and expect to maintain a clientele?  Needless to say, we will not be back and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone else unless you want to get sick and be treated rudely!

We were looking for a place to have lunch on a Sunday, and kept finding places that were busy or closed.  This place ended up fitting the bill perfectly.  It was a great casual place to stop in after our Sunday hike.  They have a terrific selection of hot dog options, and everything we tried was yummy!  Check out their condiment bar too.  Definitely will be back!

Ok, so this place was fun for the people-watching, and I like the atmosphere.  But it's WAY too loud, and it's silly that they are closed on Sundays and Mondays!  Also, the bartenders are rude.  My boyfriend had never had an old-fashioned the way they made it, and he asked about it and the bartender was totally rude to him and insisted that the way they made it was the RIGHT way.  I was looking forward to checking this place out, but probably will not be back again.

I like Buffalo Wild Wings. I've never really had a problem at one before. But this was a pretty terrible experience. I was able to get a table no problem, and the server came out pretty quickly. But it went downhill from there. Once I ordered, it took a really long time to get my food. Then, when it did come out, half of my order was wrong. So I had to wait again to get the rest of my order. My food was delivered to my table in three separate trips. No apology for the wait, no discount. So I finally finish my food, get a to-go box for the half of my order that was received last so I'd already eaten the rest of it, and pay. Then when my transaction hits my bank, I realized they'd overcharged me. There were two transactions for BWW on my bank account instead of one. Just a bad experience all around. I won't be back.

Not sure why this place has bad reviews. We came early on a Saturday night. Not busy when we got here, but it started to fill up quickly. We used a Groupon, which was a great deal, but their happy hour is almost as good! And it's all day every day! (But not for takeout) Overall, good service, good service, good bargain. Will definitely be back!

This place has a great atmosphere and an excellent happy hour.  Awesome drink and sushi prices.  The dragon roll is my favorite, but there are plenty of specials to choose from, and their sushi is pretty good.   The location is great too, close to all the shopping in Scottsdale Quarter.  Definitely a good place to stop in for a sushi happy hour!

I like the concept, and I think it's done decently, but I can't give above two stars because the bathrooms here were probably some of the filthiest I've seen in a movie theater. I mean, seriously, send someone in to check it out every now and then throughout the day. There was toilet paper all over the floor, and someone had spilled an entire salad on the floor in the first stall. I'll give it another shot, but that was a real turn-off. I really wanted to like this place, but I just think it needs some work. Hard not to compare it to iPic, which, while it is much more pricey, knows how to pull off the same concept.

Really liked this place a lot. I stopped in here with a friend while roaming around Old Town Scottsdale and having dinner at RnR. I wish I'd come here and skipped RnR! This place has friendly bartenders, a great beer list (with some really good Belgians on tap!), and really yummy Belgian fries with some of the best sauces you will ever have. My boyfriend enjoyed the 32 oz boot that you can order a beer in. We will definitely be back for more!

Loved the atmosphere here, and the beer list isn't too shabby, either. Boasting around 30 taps, and most are not just your local beers like SanTan and Four Peaks like a lot of bars around the area. This place has a great selection, especially if you are a beer snob like me. For the food, we only tried dessert, but the homemade pop-tarts are amazing! Don't leave without trying some. The rest of the menu looked good as well, and we'll definitely be back to try more.

This was the first plumber that we were actually able to get ahold of when we came downstairs on a Saturday morning and our carpet was soaked because the washer was leaking. Everywhere else we had to leave messages or couldn't reach anyone. These guys actually answered the phone! Did a diagnosis over the phone and came out and fixed our issue the following Monday.

Ironically, we visited this place (finally) right before we went to Maui. Cute little place with great food that's not too pricey (for Scottsdale, anyway). Loved the fish and chips and the coconut shrimp. My boyfriend also loved the fish tacos. I'll definitely be back again!

Had trouble trying to get ahold of a repair man for our gas oven. Justin answered on my second call, and made it to our house the same day, on time from when he said he would, with a call on the way. Of course, when we got there he had the magic touch and the oven worked fine for him! He charged me a reasonable rate for the service call and said if the oven had any more problems within 30 days, he'd return with no service call fee and still take the service call fee off the price of the part needed for the oven, if we ended up needing it. Super nice and seems like a trustworthy guy! Will be calling him for any appliance problems in the future.
