Rubbish..waited 20 mins seating while no one offered anything.. meanwhile sorted a restaurant close by with more personality. Waiter arrives after schmoozing for close to 30 mins At another table (you don't have to work that hard for a tip),  asking me what I wanted, lost my interest at this place already and I walked out
