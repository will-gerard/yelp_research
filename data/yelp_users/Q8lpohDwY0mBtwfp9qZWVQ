So I tried this place... Gave it a couple chances... But everything just seems off. Usually wrong ingredients in items... Or the food just tasting off. Yeah I really haven't been back and even though I drive by it I usually go home and cook myself... Good thing my mom taught me!

Yeah i think I should just avoid Cycle Gear (The retail locations) because the service inside sucks.  I walked in and not one said hello or may i help you. I guess if i had breasts they would because they sure jumped up to help the girl who came in after me.  I asked on guy if they had a certain bulb to which he replied all we have is right there... thanks for the help... I had already looked there... Maybe they dont have computers to check on items... oh well im done with Cycle Gear now...

So I've never actually been here... I tried to get the necessary parts for my 20k service from them though... They took my name, phone number email... Only to completely ignore me. Ended up going to HeadKace in Tempe and they ordered everything I wanted, price matched everything all in a couple if hours... Picked up my parts today... They still haven't contacted me... I was told they had good service but I find that really hard to believe since they couldn't even call me back... Chandler of Harley took two days but at least they got back to me.... Oh well at least they helped me find HeadKace!

So I decided to order food from them for lunch for myself and a coworker. The ordering was easy enough and I was told it would be here by 1215 ordered at 1140am... I though sure not a problem... It got here at 1230... After I called to ask what was taking so long. No apologies or nothing... If you say your going to be here at a specific time show up promptly! It's my lunch hour! It was shortened thanks to you and your employees who don't give a damn. 23 bucks for 2 half sandwiches and small salads after tip.. Shoulda ordered something good for this price. I got the turkey sandwich  and it was rather forgettable. I don't think I will be ordering from this establishment again. Shoulda just got in n out.

Called them looking for parts for my JATO 3.3 but they didn't have the parts I needed but they were nice enough to refer me to hobby town. Nice people to bad they didn't have my parts. --------------------------------------------------- Updated 8-18-2014  So I went in today just to see what they had.. They had my rims and tire combo for 21.99 which is cheaper than rc planet.com... They are really nice also and helpful, I'll be back for sure.

I was at this location for about 31 days following a motorcycle accident.  Dr. Ortega pretty much saved my life and put me back together. The ICU nurses aren't great and I will leave it at that. However the majority of the 6th floor nursing staff and physical therapists are beyond awesome. They were quick with my concerns and always encouraged me. John, Adele, Blanca, Teri, Kathy, Charmane, Noemi and I wish I could remember all the names of the great ones but the ones mentioned made my day everyday. There are some crappy ones too but once you got some of these people it made up for it. I'm now at Osborn healthcare and I wish I was back at Scottsdale.  They really seem to care about people on the 6th floor and it was as much of a pleasure as could be staying in hospital for that amount of time.

Cool little shop in Tempe. Talked to Ryan about converting my SS back into a geared 29er... The price was more than fair and they assembled it and told me they will help maintain it since I bought my parts there... Build took a little longer than planned but they gave me a loaner so I wouldn't be a loner! Ryan is a great guy and I would recommend him and use him for future builds.  Thanks Ryan!

So I've been here several times... Never really looked at their beer selection until today and I was impressed. The owner is still improving his selection.  The prices are pretty good too! I'll be back a lot.

So i decided to try the mexican place across the street from me thinking it might be tasty... unfortunately my phone call started with a elderly woman who did not know what was on the menu and she almost caused me to cuss at her and hang up... I finally get my order through and i go to pick up my food.  It was sorta busy and the service was better once i got inside... sadly the food was... bland... i ordered the Machacha plate with corn tortillas... there was a small lake beneath my machacha, the beans were ok as well as the rice.  The tortillas were whatevers also.  It was bad but it was good... i dont think ill be returning... maybe im spoiled cuz im from California... so much better food in Cali

The sandwiches are decent at best but the spring rolls here are not good at all compared to the ones in Cali... Wait they just aren't good. The sauce is for lack of a better word "gross" and the spring roll was almost frozen from the cooler they put it in. It doesn't have the vermicelli noodles in it either and no peppers or pickled daikon or carrots... Pretty much a fail all the way around.

Nice bunch of guys. They know there stuff. I bought a used Jato and sadly it had kore broken pieces than the guy mentioned so I made math stops there this weekend and every time they were kore than helpful. They had all the parts I needed... Not wanted kind you... They said they could offer them but I passed cuz it's a little cheaper online. There prices are way better than Hobby Destination...  HD is way expensive... Hobby Town is slightly kore but it's there when you need it right away and they will help you inside to make sure you don't get the wrong stuff. Thanks guys! I'll he back I'm sure...

This place isn't bad but it's not great especially for the prices they charge. What really brings this place down is is employees and management! The girl at the register is beyond slow and if she could go any slower she would be going backwards. The manager is just an ass he argued with my employees I sent to get lunch over trivial stuff. The food as I said is Ok but for the price I would expect much more. If you use a Groupon there watch out the manager gets annoyed and starts arguments. If you order ahead of time you're food might be ready and you won't have to feel like a sardine in the small cramped building. I would recommend going elsewhere unless you make money like Donald Trump and have the patience of a monk.

Ok... Where do I begin? Decor? Service? Food? Ambiance? Ok let's start with decor...  Conveyor belt sushi... Photographs of customers (probably to supply proof people eat here$ Christmas lights inside on trees in July... Poor hand written signs... Very ummmm ugly dishes.... I must resist to say anymore about the crappy decor...  Service... They lag on refills and place their arms in your face as they are doing so... I tried to order from the list hoping for some fresher?!?!?! Fish... But the Korean chef picked up a old piece and handed it to ne... Thanks for the old fish...  The food... Was ummm... Yeah I'm going to get a sandwich as I am typing this... The fish isn't supposed to be paper thin! Please take the pudding, cheesecake, canned orange, V8 and apple juice off the belt that's hella ghetto...  Sadly this is another poor attempt at Japanese food! If your not Japanese stop trying to fake the funk! I'm Japanese I can tell the difference even though other people can't!

So far no chicken and waffle place has been that good (lo-lo's, roscoes, home of chicken and waffles).  There chicken needs a little more kick to it... The red rooster helped but my moms chicken is way better... The grits could have used some more salt also... The service was really good but the prices were kinda high but that seems to be the thing with chicken and waffle places I guess... High prices for something that can be done at home  for a fraction of the price.  It wasn't bad but then again it wasn't great also... Roscoes is better in my opinion and they offer more...

Beware of this rental car company. They change reservation rates so check your reserved price vs the amount charged, especially if you add gas. I was quoted 3.05 a gallon to prepay my gas they charged me 3.47 in gas prices and they raised my rate. My original cost out the door was 88.03 from an invoice provided by them. They chsnged me 63.95 for prepaid gas but billed me 170. When I brought this up to them they said the fee was correct. I asked to speak to a manager and he would not come out to discuss my issue. I filed a dispute they said they were incorrect and I should have been charged 160. When I went over the numbers with them they said the difference in price was for gas tax at the airport.   From Payless: Joe Williams  Thank you for contacting us regarding your recent rental. We did make an adjustment, it seems the system glitched charging $7.50 more for the tank. Please be advised that there is tax on the tank of fuel. In addition, the prepaid fuel is 3.09 per gallon, we only charged you the 3.05.  We will send a new receipt to the email on file. Please respond back with any other questions.  We appreciate your business!  Thank you  Elliot Standridge Station Manager Payless Car Rental 602.681.9589 ------------------------------------------------- I asked for their corporate to contact me he wouldn't allow it so I had to call the international call center and they had to file a new dispute ticket and hopefully I should have a call back from their corporate office now. I will follow up my review after the issue is resolved. The money doesn't bother me the lies and principals do!  -------------------------------------------------- My rental charges were suppose to $84.36 )rental confirmation number 13210247) + $63.95 (prepaid fuel) = $148.31. I was actually quoted $3.05 a gallon x 18.5 = $56.43 and that was the only reason i accepted the prepaid gas it ended up costing $3.47 a gallon x 18.5 = $63.95?!?!?!? Your total charges on my card are $170.09. So even with the incorrect amount being charged how is my total coming up to this number $170.09?!?!?!?! Your employee changed my rate! I can see on the bill! I asked for a supervisor or manager when I called and he would not get on the phone Jose Gutierrez is a pretty horrible manager in my opinion when he wont talk to me about a dispute! I am also contacting my bank to dispute the charges as well. Wed, Jul 23 2014 11:48pm - Phoenix AZ Joe Williams  Thank you for contacting us regarding your recent rental. We did make an adjustment, it seems the system glitched charging $7.50 more for the tank. Please be advised that there is tax on the tank of fuel.

We appreciate your business!  Thank you  Elliot Standridge Station Manager Payless Car Rental 602.681.9589 Thu, Jul 24 2014 11:01am You also raised the rate on my rental. 84 + 63.95 (overpriced gas rate) does not equal 160 still. Also Arizona does not charge a fuel tax even so the tax will not equal the 160 you are charging me. You have my confirmation number so you know much my rate was with taxes. Is changing my daily rate part of your business practice? I was quoted a rate. I should pay my rate plus the 18.5 gallons of gas. Please figure out the real total (I already know the answer) because 160 is incorrect. I will report you to the BBB for bad business practices and not honoring a contract. Thu, Jul 24 2014 2:36pm - Phoenix AZ Mr. Williams,  The taxes applied to your fuel/total are applied by the airport as they consider the prepaid fuel option a service and all services are taxable.  The adjustment for the prepaid fuel previously issued and the refund previously applied is the final adjustment to be made. Your rate was never changed and was honored at $10.29/day as booked. Current and final total remains at $160.46.  Thank you Thu, Jul 24 2014 7:21pm I received a invoice from Payless stating my balance if I paid for the fuel myself my charge would have been 88.00, you responded my gas was 63.95 - 7.50= 56.75. How does 56.75 + 88= 160?!?! You need to check your math. My original quote from online reservation said my bill without gas would have been 84.03! Your guy changed my rate! I have the reservation confirmation along with two invoices showing your guy raised my rate. Please fix this so I can pay my correct bill not trumped up charges from your dishonest guy at the rental center! Thu, Jul 24 2014 10:54pm - Phoenix AZ The rate is exactly the same. When you swapped out the original vehicle the fuel cost went up to 69 plus tax. The nissan altima has a bigger tank. You have to remember, it is 69 plus tax.84.03+69= 153.03, plus around 7 dollars in tax. So your final bill is 160.46. -------------------------------------------------- I will post the rest if the message on another review

So I saw this place when I was out driving around and decided to take a chance on em... I wasn't disappointed! I got the sopes and I enjoyed them thoroughly. The meat was flavored well, the sopes wasn't hard and dried out, the beans and rice that came with it were quite tasty as well.  What really made them stand apart was their service though. Everyone in their was beyond friendly... So much so I was gonna give 4 stars but I had to give em 5! Go check em out!

Yeah... No! This place is seriously horrible. The whole set up is strange and the ramen is even stranger. I would rate this as the worst ramen shop I've ever been to. I've had ramen all over California and Japan... Why even call it ramen...

Ok... Went here to see my friend play...  He says the food was good... Heard that before... I went in it's really small but it's ok.. I e been in smaller spots. I ordered the Lomo Saltado... My friend ordered the ceviche and fried calamari... Everything was... Really good! Best Lomo Saltado I've had in Arizona... The aji sauce was great too! I will be coming back! I just wish the portions were bigger compared to the price. I don't mind paying a little more here for good Peruvian.. Beats paying less for sub par food I don't want to eat. All in all good place try em out.

So i was starving and since im from California i decided to trust some yelp reviews... guess Arizona people have different taste buds... i ordered a canadian bacon and pineapple and some wings... it was very unsatisfying... I dont think i will be ordering from here again.  The crust was thin and floppy and the toppings were minimal... the wings were ok. at best but i have had way better almost everywhere.  I gave them 2 stars just cuz i felt like being nice... they are closer to 1.25...

This place is an abomination. I have been a resident here for over a month, trying to get a shower here is pretty much impossible, even though I request them on the two days a week they decide to shower us. I have had 2 showers and 1 bed bath since my check in. The occupational therapy is pretty much a joke. They don't teach you anything on how to do for yourself outside of the hospital, they simply show you mediocre exercises you can YouTube or Google and ignore you. So basically they are stealing from insurance by saying they are doing therapy when you could do the same things in your room and not wasting your insurances money on hokey exercises designed to cheat insurances. They won't contact your physician no matter how many times you tell them to. I checked in and told them of an appointment 3 weeks out and the day before the appointment after asking numerous times for X-rays for the appointment they said they knew nothing of the appointment and scrambled trying to get X-rays and transportation set up. When I got to my appointment they forgot to send my X-rays with me! I called the hospital and spoke to the Director of Nursing Tonya Hampton and she said they just wanted the finalized report not the X-rays... As the doctor is asking me at the appointment for the much needed X-rays. If you need pain meds or just your call light answered be prepared to wait anywhere from 45 minutes and up while the nurses congregate around the nursing station ignoring the lights and buzzing sounds informing them of patients in need. I even asked them if they were going to get the buzzing noises or blinking lights only to get the response if "someone is down there, they will get to it." They also run out of your medication on occasion only to tell you tough they will get it in later.  The nurses here do not understand HIPAA (patients personal information and treatment disclosure basically) and when they get upset they talk about you and your treatment to patients. I got this first hand when Dorothy told me about a lazy patient with pnuemonia at the end if my hall. When you inform the Director of Nursing or Director of the hospital they don't do anything about the nurses but they will try to discharge you even before your insurance runs out by saying therapy can longer help your condition. They do move a little when you say you will contact outside services and corporate... Once again after they will try to discharge you. This is even when you are in a wheelchair with nobody to help at home with care or treatment and they never trained you in therapy to be prepared to leave. (Yes even though your insurance paid then $45 every 15 minutes if therapy). So if you want subpar treatment from a center that only looks at you as a paycheck then this is the place for you. (Even the nurses here talk about how your only a paycheck... And how they are totally understaffed because Tonya got rid of employees (shower aid... Remember 2 showers one bed bath 4 weeks with therapy 6 times a week) and never supplied them with the promised extra aid so they are running back and forth trying to pick up the slack from other nurses who don't want to work). The Director is 29 years old and has no clue what he is doing in my opinion. The Director of Nursing is just as bad. Hopefully you read this and do not make the mistake a lot of us patients did by coming to this hell hole run by incompetent leadership.  To say I hate La Estancia with all my heart and soul would pale in comparison to how I really feel.  I'm guessing the review from Carol K is fabricated by a family friend of the staff. Everyone I talk to here have nothing nice to say about this place.  Also things tend to come up missing here... From food that only the staff has access to, along with a sweatshirt taken out of my room. Things here seem to grow legs.

This place is pretty hit or miss. The past couple of months they have been good.  I went on monday 05/05/2014 and sadly the guy was looking for every piece of Chicken Adobo with bones... not one piece was all meat.  I got 3 huge bones and hardly any meat. I wouldnt complain but I actually watched him touch each piece to make sure it had a bone... sadly I will have to stop coming here as a result.  The food has been better than usual but just cuz im not Pinoy doesnt mean i shouldnt get chicken instead of bones...

So I went here on a Wednesday night because whack a$$ El Hefe doesn't allow Jordan's (black people wearing Jordan's in) service was decent in the beginning but the lame a$$ bouncer said I was lucky because becauae they don't allow Jordan's either... Yet they both allowed flip flops... Yeah whatever... Then we ask for our bill and we have to wait because some shit happened there... I don't give a sh!t if you have drama at your bar don't hold someone's credit card hostage when all they want to do is leave... Then walking out the patio exit I'm confronted by the gayest n'sync/jackass member ever and the retard tells me I can't go out that say because they keep a head count in who's going out?!?!?! Dude stop smoking sh!t it is affecting your ability to think. If you said it was policy I would understand but to lie about something that trivial, you insulted my intelligence.  Nobody at that bar could bounce anywhere I've bounced in California... That whole pussy crew would get mobbed. The highlight of the night was the waitress who didn't serve us... Thus  the 2 stars instead of one. I will never return and f@ck Scottsdale and the thousandaires... Broke fools trying to floss.. I wear my J's at real clubs in Cali and don't get sweated and I definitely don't have a wanna be pretty boy trailer trash f@ck lying to me about the dumbest sh!t. Stop catering to broke fools... Just cuz I don't dress like a douche doesn't mean in broke!

Went here looking for some aorta for my JATO... Walked in and got ignored by the girl in the front and the guy behind the counter, so my son and I searched on our own. I didn't see anything so I saw some tires and rims and I was told it wouldn't fit my rc (different guy). So I asked about some shocks and when they handed them to me I was shocked they were 75.00.   I asked why they were so much and the guy behind the counter asked if I would like to pay retail... I said I thought it was retail considering I've seen them for about 57 everywhere else. He promptly told me it was because there's came with springs! When I showed him they didn't come with springs he simply said oh well that's the price.  I quickly left and orderd them online... This place is a ripoff. One person was helpful hence the 2 stars as opposed to the one star they deserve. Go anywhere else I'm sure you will find better pricing.

Wow! I ordered a pizza today Canadian bacon and pineapple... All I can say is wow. This was a really good pizza. The crust was cooked perfectly and the toppings were excellent! Well the pineapple seemed canned but that's kind of to be expected but the cheese was divine! Plenty of it too. The good came fast and the delivery guy was courteous. The salad I hit with it had fresh mushrooms, tomatoes, lettuce, spinach, red cabbage and olives.. I was expecting the usual old semi decent salad but I'm actually looking forward to reading this salad. I will be ordering from here again. Thanks again is good to know bring laid up in the hospital won't limit awesome pizza's

This place is pretty good... Been to tons of Taiwanese places back in Orange County. The service is fast and they are really nice. Only been here once before this the young waitress remembered me!

Food is still ok here but the service was horrible. I don't care if your watching the World Cup bring me water, bring my appetizer before I finish my meal, and don't  bring me plain pot stickers with no sauces or sauce dishes cuz you are focused on a game your not even playing! Your business might do better if you brought in better employees and get rid of the tall guy with glasses who was rude and doesn't know the first thing about service.

Wow! These shop is awesome! I was trying to get the supplies to do my 20k on my Harley and I called Chester Harley, Harley of Scottsdale and Chandler Harley... It took Chandler Harley 2 days to get back to me... I have yet to hear from the other two still... Headkace called me back same day sent a quote and price matched me... When I got there they were even nicer in person. This place has exceptional service and I will be buying all my parts from them. I'm still in awe... Thank you guys I'll be in soon to pick up the gasket and fork fluid! You guys are truly amazing!

I couldn't be unhappier! I came from Scottsdale healthcare across the street where I received excellent service on the 6th floor to this place where they were unprepared for me. I was in a motorcycle accident and required 6 surgeries and I get pain meds and other medications which are scheduled but Osborn had nothing for me when I arrived. I had to wait over 7 hours for my medication because Jenn (evening supervisor) was pretty much useless. I asked from the time I arrived till early in the morning for my meds because I was in pain. She finally came in with my meds at 3:25am with my medication I found out the next day my meds were dropped off at 1am! How does she still have a job? If you push the button to call a nurse be prepared to wait 10-40 minutes for it to be answered. The night staff is a joke with the exception of Moe who did what he could to make me comfortable. The day crew is decent at best. I wish I could have stayed at Scottsdale I prefer their physical therapist and occupational physical therapist also. They lack the equipment like Scottsdale had also. Osborn doesn't even have the leg compression machine which helps prevent blood clots. I could go on but I think you can guess how I feel about Osborn. Hopefully after I get out of here I will never have to come back, I would never bring a loved one or even a hated enemy here. I am completely unhappy here. Hands down Jenn is the worst nurse I've ever had to deal with.

I was trying to find something to eat and noticed Opa life had moved into the old big fat Greek. I decided to try them out and placed an order to go, 20 minutes later after I saw people who came in after receiving food and I was still waiting and losing time to eat before I had to start work again. I went up and asked what was going on and all I heard was sorry from the server not even the cook, or the person that took my order just the random server... From the time I complained my order it took them 3-4 minutes to get it in a bag and have me on my way. So they basically wasted almost half my lunch break because of unorganized individuals who didn't seem to care. The food was ok bit expensive, 1 chicken gyro and side salad was a little under 9 bucks. I prefer Pita Shack since it's better tasting and more cost effective AND they don't forget about my order and make me wait over 20 minutes for a chicken gyro and salad... I have them 2 stars because the server was really apologetic but I will not be going back.

This review us only for the Tonkotsu ramen. After seeing reviews for Dozo Izakaya I decided to check em out. I saw they had ramen and udon (never really seen that at an Izakaya) but thought what the heck can't be worse than Republic Ramen (nastiest ramen ever). I walked in and the lady who greeted me was very nice, I ordered my tonkotsu ramen and waited to see what it was all about. I am really picky when it comes to ramen (I go to Kurume Japan about once a year and all over Kyushu to eat ramen). In comparison to the ramen in Arizona I must say it is the best here. In California I don't know if I would order it...  The broth was ok but felt like something was missing, the noodles were cooked well but not the right kind of noodles... It was over all ok and I might order it if I'm not going to California or Japan anytime soon. For me they will be a place i can eat ramen without being utterly disappointed. I'm sure many people will like it! As for me it's ok, cuz I'm picky as hell. I want to try other stuff here and I'm sure I will. This is the first place where I am actually willing to return to in Arizona. The service helped a lot and gave them the extra star.  I want to try some other stuff they have and I will update as I try their other items. Give em a try

I ordered the carne asada fries... I usually can't finish cuz they give you so much at the other locations... Thus location gave about half of what the other filibertos give. They also wrapped my rolled tacos with cheese in paper?!?!? So the cheese got smashed and stuck to the paper! I won't be going to this location anymore...
