Terrible experience, the food as always very good but the person in charge of sitting us made no effort in helping us get a table for 10. Even though there were tables available. We ended up sitting in separate booth. Maybe it was my fault for being passive but really left a bad experience. Very disappointed. The open tables were never used and they don't do reservations. If over 4 people,  I will never go there again  even on a Wednesday 5/25 for lunch.

I have two garage doors that needed repair and I was afraid of how much it was going to cost. I knew one had a broken spring and the other garage separated from the door opener. Legends Garage Doors is a family business and they offered the best deal in town. Corey was very friendly, fair and honest. I wish I would have called them earlier because I delayed the repair because I thought it was going to cost a fortune.  He clearly explained what caused the issues, fixed the issues found from the installation of the garage door, and showed me how to maintain the doors in working order.  I am very satisfied with the level of service from Corey at  Legend Garage Doors.
