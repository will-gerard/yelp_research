Just picked up my bike after a tune-up and it is great.  I purchased a bmx bike for my son and Mike the owner was great, friendly, took his time and made the purchase easy for me, even stored the bike so I can surprise my son on his birthday!  Would recommend them to everyone.

Not a big fan anymore, food was good but has gone down hill as of late.  Ordered take out and they got the order wrong, Shrimp and Lobster was awful, so were the egg rolls and house low mein, over cooked and very oily.  Wonton soup was good but they didn't put the lid on tight enough and spilled all over my back seat.  I won't be going here again.
