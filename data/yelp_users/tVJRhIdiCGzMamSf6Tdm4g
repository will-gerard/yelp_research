If you are serious about running this is the place to go!!   Came here to buy some new running shoes for my significant other and right away you can tell why this was voted one of the best stores not only in the Valley but the Country.  Let me say thank you first and foremost to Scott. His service was exceptional and we couldn't be more pleased with his knowledge, attentiveness, and over all great experience in helping us find the right shoes.  He alone will make this our place to go from now on.  The staff here all are runners in their own so they truly do speak from experience.  It's a small shop that feels more intimate then say a corporate chain. No bells or whistles needed here as the staff speaks for itself.  Get top of the line exceptional gear to ensure you find the right fit for your next marathon.   I also noticed on the wall that do have a frequent podiatrist that visits and will provide a free consultation on any running injuries you may inquire while wearing their shoes.

Big Fan. . .   I have been here numerous times throughout the years and can't believe i never wrote a review sooner.  I love this place.  This location is excellent.  It sits right on the water so when the weather is nice the patio seating cannot be beat.   Every time I have been here the service is always excellent.     The food is great.  I usually order the Machaca Burro De la Casa with rice a beans and each time I am left satisfied.  Also just in case you prefer Black beans instead of Pinto or Re-fried.  Those are very good as well and have become my preferred choice of late.    For me personally this is one of the better Mexican Restaurants in the area and I would much rather drive here then each at Nandos which is closer to my home.    The only downside for others who have been here in past years. . They used to offer you bean dip with your chips and salsa, but not anymore.  Now they will charge you $4.00 as if its an appetizer dish and while it is good, for me it isn't' worth it.   Other than that, enjoy the food and the view.

I've been here a few times and so far I can say it's the Calzones that keep me coming back..  I've had the various pasta dinners, which were ok.( not bad, but not great either).  However, I have been going lately about once a week with a coworker during lunch and their calzones are delicious every time.  Reasonably priced especially during lunch hours (5.99 for a two item Calzone with a drink). Can't beat that.  And every time I have really enjoy my experience from the service, staff, and quality of the food. I have recommended this to other friends and will continue to do so.  Definitely a good place to go and support a local business.

Si Senor may I have more indeed.    Came here for the first time a few weeks back and why have j been avoiding you do so long.  This place is delicious.  Nothing fancy, but if you know good Mexican food it should be simple ingredients down right and this place does just that.   Great lunch menu if you swing in on your break.  And to top it off have a soppapilla with honey for dessert.  (Included with the lunch menu portions).

WOW.....Hidden gem in Chandler tucked away in an un-assuming strip mall.  This place is the Bees Knees, the Cats Pajamas aka just plain straight up amazing.    First off it's small and intimate and it is highly recommended to make a reservation if you plan on dining during peak times.  I made one on Open Table and was promptly seated by the friendly older gentleman. Service was excellent and couldn't be more pleased.   The food is definitely the highlight here. Chef Aaron clearly takes pride in his craft and everything he prepared was delicious.  The salmon sashimi was fresh and oh so good. A huge surprise was the Beef Tongue small plate.  WOW, I will probably order this every time I come back.    Safe to say this is now the only place in Chandler I'll be having sushi from now on.

This is the REI for the Kitchen Enthusiast!!!    I aboso-freaking-lutely love this place. What is there not to love. Whatever you need it's here and whatever you don't need but want...Yep it's here also.  Everything from picnic napkins, top shelf cookware to amazing Olive Oil for 9.99.    Every gadget you may need to make your cooking experience a master chef experience.  The same way an auto mechanic needs the right tools for the job a home cook needs ( 4 different styles of Whisk ) ;-).  Fish spatula, uh how did I ever cook fish before this!!    They are always super friendly and on weekends will usually offer you a free coffee sample while you shop.

Average overall. But they have a Scorpion issue outside!!!   Came here for a quick date night. Nothing special but haven't been in years and thought why not.   First off, if you come to this location during Fri/Sat night. Be prepared to wait. Like 1hr for a table for two kind of wait.   And while the food was good; it was not wait 1 hr for a table good.    They have plenty of waiting/seating outside (no way I'd wait during the inferno summer) but this night is was nice out with a breeze so we waited.  While waiting  BE WARNED!! They clearly have a Scorpion problem outside.  While waiting along the small wall in front we notice two dead Scorpions right there at out feet.  Hard to tell if they were dead from being stepped on or sprayed first. Either way not a good sign.  We move to another area just to be safe and what do you know.  Two more dead ones along the wall. So be careful/ mindful of your hands/feet and little ones.   Once inside our service was excellent. No issues there. Waiter was great, attentive, and friendly.   Ordered the orange peel chicken and the avocado lobster roll. They were ok and not bad but nothing great either. Could have had the same quality at Pei Wei. Don't think I'll go out of my way to come back.

Good Beer, Good food; not much more I can ask for.   Have yet to have a bad experience here. I'm a rewards member so it pays off since I visit often.  Can't review much on wait staff as I always sit at the bar top and have great service.  Would recommend.

Stopped in with my girlfriend to enjoy some RnR and ended up with a pedicure.  And let me say that I thoroughly enjoyed every second it.  As soon as you walk in, it's very clean, modern, relaxing and they are very friendly.  What I found surprising soothing was all of the pedicure chairs are located behind a glass water wall that shoots bubbles every ten seconds or so.  Definitely adds to the relaxing ambiance.   Staff was very friendly and very good.  I've been to other nail salons in the area and this will probably be our go to spot in the future.

If you're looking for a great place in downtown Gilbert look no further.   One of my favorites for breakfast or lunch.  Great quality and excellent ambiance.  Has a very local contemporary feel.  I love supporting local businesses and this place is at the top of my list.   Same family that owns Joes BBQ and Joes Farmhouse so you know they don't slack on anything.  Even if your not that hungry the coffee bar is excellent.  You can't go wrong and let me know when you go so I can join you!!!  Enjoy!!

I live next to here and it's everything I like in a supermarket.  I love to daily grocery shop and this Safeway is always clean, fresh produce, fresh baked goods and pretty good meat/fish counter.   Customer service is always friendly.

Didn't know what to expect, but glad I didn't have high hopes as it was average at best. .     Came here around 6pm and it was dead.  Aside from a few people in the bar area watching the game we were the only party in the dining room.    Service was ok. Waitress was friendly, but they were terribly slow (not sure why as there weren't other guest). It took about 10 minutes to even get water and put our drink order in after we were seated. Not sure if she was the only one working the entire place between the few in the bar room and us in the dining room.  Seems she did her best.   Now for the food and the real reason for the rating.  I ordered the Sport Club sandwich. It was ok. Just your typical ham and turkey on toasted wheat bread.  Slightly greasy which was odd.  Nothing special. A few in our party ordered the Apple Walnut Salad.  This was highly disappointing.  Unfortunately expecting fresh crisp apple slices would have been too much to ask as the slices had the consistency of soggy pears. Had to be canned slices, or they just committed a hate crime against a regular apple. This was the same for both salads Rest of salad was bland and equally a let down.    The entrees were highly over priced ranging from $12-$27 but with quality that should have ranged $7-$12.  Guess now it was obvious why we were the only ones in there.

Some of the best service I have ever gotten. I really want to thank Brandon. He was a great example of what service should be. Helpful, knowledgeable, and remained calm and friendly even when he was the only one trying to service a line of 5 deep and the phone ringing non-stop.  He maintained his composure and even though everyone had to wait a while we all were more then understanding.  So I hope his manager reads this cause truly thank you.    Him alone would make me drive out of my way to this location.  Safe to say this is my location of choice.

What's not to love about this place!  If you're looking for a great Irish bar look no further.  Great food, great beer, with a laid back atmosphere.    The food is excellent.  Every time I come downtown I seem to always find time to at least stop in for a beer.    If you want a place that doesn't seem so fancy and you just want to have a bar among regulars then this is your spot.   Recommend to everyone.

Yep never again.    I came here with a friend of mine cause he was certain this was a Petes FishnChips.  I tried telling him it wasn't, but he was certain it was.  Once we got here and realized it wasn't it was too late.  Came during our lunch break so didn't have much time and figured why not.     Well there's a reason this isn't Petes.  First I guess it is pretty cheap, but you get what you pay for.  I ordered a two piece combo.  Which is two pieces of fish with fries.  The fish was terrible.  Fist clue should have been that the fish was in a perfect square! (Processed all the way).  These literately seemed like they took fish sticks out of box from the grocery store.   Everything was bland and fries were undercooked.

Love this hidden gem in Chandler.  First off, you have taco in the name...SIGN ME UP!!!   Is a small little restaurant, but don't let he looks fool you. This Mexican place knows how to do simple food right.    Been here a few times and each time I leave more then pleased.  Love the Machaca beef hard tacos. They make their own taco shells not some store bought nonsense.   Rice is great and the pinto beans are absolutely delicious.   They are very rich as you can Tel them make them with lard and/or bacon grease. Mmmmm. :)   They are always super fried my and more than happy to recommend something new each time.    Word the wise though. They are located right across the street from Chandler High so during school days either come before 12 or after 1 otherwise the line is intense.

Definitely one of my favorite breakfast spots.    It's sits right on the run way where you can watch airplanes land and take off from the patio.  They are adjacent to an open hanger where you can walk through with your kids and see some of the planes up close.  My two girls love coming here. This place is small so it does get very busy very quickly, but don't let the wait deter you, it is worth it.   The service has always been excellent for me and the breakfast is always delicious.  Nothing fancy just simple breakfast done right; what more can you ask for. Recommend to everyone!!

I've been here a few times and it never disappoints.  Usually come in here for brunch and each time it's just simple and well done.  Would highly recommend.  The Eggs Benedict are excellent.  Can't go wrong with the Traditional Bene!!! Wait staff is always friendly and love that they also have a coffee bar..

Pretty good for being a chain BBQ place.  Aside from it getting pretty busy (which I guess is a good thing) I have never had a bad experience.   The service is always great, very friendly and helpful.   The bbq is also excellent.  I love everything from the rib tips to the wings.  The brisket can be a little dry at times so just a heads up.  I usually always get the pulled pork and some spare ribs. Love the corn bread muffins.   Also if you like a good spicy BBQ sauce. Try mixing the Devils Spit with the Texas Pit.. Definitely a must for me when I go here.  I also love that they are still one of the few places that give Vets a free meal on Veterans Day.  Give to the community and the community returns in kind.  Can't say that about many chain restaurants.

Unique little place with its own character that's is always pleasant whether you come in for breakfast, brunch, or lunch!!  This place has maintained its own little niche in the part of Chandler and has a very homie decor and the staff is extremely friendly.    First, I love how you can call in ahead of time to place your name on the list. Then they have free coffee while you wait for your table.    The Eggs Benedict are excellent always simple, but very well executed. They offer plenty of healthy options ranging from oatmeal to egg whites.    My latest visit I ordered the English Toast with a French Flair and again they were very good.

Another one of the great places in Gilbert owned by the Joes family.  Liberty market, Joes Farm Grill, and Joes Bbq are excellent on every level.    This place is amazing because It is everything that is nostalgic about downtown Gilbert. They haven't lost the family owned feeling when you walk in. Staff is always friendly and helpful.    Now on the to the food. I really love their BBQ, everything from the chicken, pork, ribs and brisket.  And to top it off their sides are outstanding and the sauce is so good you could drink it.    This is a staple in Gilbert and will be for many years.

Had a wonderful experience.      I have been wanting to come here for a while and so glad I finally made the time.  We booked a table on the Open Table app and wow that was awesome just walking in and being seating right away.     Everyone was very friendly and eager to answer any questions we had as this was our first visit.     The food was outstanding.  Great seasoning and excellent combination of flavors.  We started with the lobster potstickers, which were very good and u highly recommend.  My girlfriend ordered the scallops and pork belly and they were very tender and cooked perfectly.  I ordered the Braised Short Ribs. Wow they were delicious, tender, and perfectly seasoned.  The mash that came with them was just as excellent and the broccolini and carrots were simple yet a nice touch.    We had mentioned we were there to celebrate an early birthday, and even though it still wasn't her bday Roy's still brought us a dessert and even took our picture from their camera and printed us a photo.     It's the little things that stand out the most and Roy's excelled in that area.  I highly recommend to everyone and I can't wait to go back.

Something is seriously wrong!!   I am a fan Pei Wei.  I have been for years, but so far I have been here a few times and each time to food is terrible.  I'm not sure what is wrong with the cooks, but everything is always far to spicy.  One week I'll order the sesame chicken from the gilbert location and it's excellent.  Then I go to this location off of Queen Creek and the sauce is mainly just soy sauce with no other flavor except salt.  I have even asked if they could remake my dish and it still comes back tasting the same.    I like a few chain restaurants because I can always bank on the quality being consistent , but not here.  Safe to say I will never come back to this location. Even though it's closer to my home I'd rather drive 20 minutes out of my way.

So with Pancake in the name I only have one thing to say.....Challenge ACCEPTED!!!!   This place gets crazy busy on weekends so either come early or plan to wait accordingly.    But once your in oh it's so worth it.  No matter what you get you cannot leave without getting pancakes. Share them if you must but please don't make the mistake of not getting any.  They have tons of varieties and I hear the Apple bake is a must (on my hit list).    I'm a traditional guy so bring on the buttermilk. Simple but delicious. Keep them coming cause I'm about to do work!!!   Overall great experience with exceptional staff.  Can't wait to come back (I see you apple bake)!!!!

Now that's what I call authentic.   Why drive 5-6 hours south when one step through these doors will make you feel like you just transported down South.    It's located inside the Mercado, but don't let the outside detract.  This place has all the charm to Mexican Street shops with a fantastic little eatery inside.  The aroma hit my senses like if I was at Nana's house.    Everything, smelled absolutely delicious and you could tell it was made from scratch.  And it may have been football Sunday everywhere else, but in here is was Futbol Sunday.  All the TVs were set accordingly. Talk about GOOAAAAALLLL!!!  The staff was excellent.  Very eager to answer any questions we had.  Extremely friendly.    Now for the food.  We ordered a few different items; Birria - this is a go to dish and so freaking good, Lengua (tongue) Tacos - These were very tender and done right.  Simple yet great execution.  That have a salsa/topping bar for all your onion/cilantro needs.  Also ordered a Torta de Pierna - (shredded pork, avocado, and sour cream) this was huge, but again was good. Top it all off with a Mexican Coke.  Food Coma here I come!!!    Safe to say I'll be coming back.

BEST Philly Cheesesteaks in AZ !!!   This place is awesome.  Very hole in the wall but doesn't get more authentic.  The owners are super friendly and always happy to talk to you.    Love their signature red sauce on the cheesesteaks it makes them that much better.  I've never been to Philly but I imagine if I do this is what it would be and taste like.  If you come here enough they will remember you and what you order. How awesome is that.  I hope this place last forever as it's a staple in Chandler.

Pleasantly surprised.  My first time here as I'm never on this side of town, but came here based icon a recommendation.    Place isn't much to look it bi only ordered the taco combination plate, but what I lived about it.  Is this is simple Mexican food done right.  Not greasy.  Not covered is stupid enchilada sauce or some other over salty mess.   Rice and beans were prefect.  Great flavor and not over salted.   I had hard shell beef tacos and the shells were homemade not some Ortega store brought crap.     Wish this was over in Chandler as I would love to try something else on the menu.    For anyone who is going through reviews and isn't sure. This place is worth a quick stop.

Booze everywhere how bad can it be.  Throw in their 5cent wine deal and now we're cooking.   Staff was very friendly and helpful.  Ready to answer any questions we had.  While I still prefers Total Wine that's just personal preference as this was just fine

Can't believe this is the first review I've written about San Tan.  I love this place. Definitely one of my favorite breweries in Az. Great food excellent beer and always a friendly staff.   What more could I ask for. They play live music most Weekends so that's also a nice bonus.  Downtown Chandler had done a great job of revitalizing the area and this is just one more positive notch on that belt.  Prices are reasonable.  Only downside is place can get very crowded so getting a table could be a to do, but otherwise it's worth the wait in my opinion.    Epicenter is a nice smooth Ale, Devils Ale has a good bite to it.   And love Mr. Pineapple in the summer.  I recommend this place to all my friends and especially those who enjoy good beer from out of town.

This location is the complete opposite of every Starbucks I've ever been. Horrible service and incredibly slow.  The staff isn't trained to handle any type of morning rush.  I'm pretty patient and can completely understand times get busy. But they could only do one thing at a time. Every barista I've know is great at what they do and have no issue managing the crowds. I ordered a simple coffee and some oatmeal.  It took them over 30 min to get me my oatmeal. Whaaaat!!! Perhaps they had to harvest their own oats.    Everyone in line was equally frustrated to the point of telling new customers they might be better going elsewhere.

NEVER AGAIN!!!!!  I checked the reviews before I came here and saw 2 stars and thought wow. It's a car wash how bad can it be.  Well I came to find out it's terrible.  I came in Sunday afternoon. I expected it to be busy but it wasn't. Nothin outrageous just normal amount of cars.  The time stamp on my receipt when I paid the cashier was 12:50.  They weren't able to finish the half a** job on my truck until 1:55.    Like I said they were not busy just completely inept and disorganized.  It is completely true that this place took a turn for the worst after the immigration issue they had.    Either way I'll never waste my time here again as I had to go over my truck again due to the poor job they did.  And to top it off whatever they used to wipe down my dashboard smelled of rotten fish rag mixed with the smell of butter spray (random but that's best way to describe the odor).  Took me 4 days to get it out.

Don't think I'll be going back.    This place has literally gone the way of other chains where they think they get to big to really care about the quality and people will still go.    Everything was terrible.  We came in for an early meal around 330 or so. Place wasn't busy by any means.  Waitress was completely disinterested in helping or even accurately taking our order.  She had to come back at least three times to verify what we ordered.  Even then once the food came our orders still were incorrect.   The food was just as bad.  For being a steak house they should know how to cook a medium steak.  Everything was over cooked and dry and over salted.  My steamed vegetables tasted like I was eating salt rocks. I mean it's steam veggies why are they so salty.  My girlfriend ordered the bbq chicken and it was an overlooked chicken breast completely engulfed by bbq sauce where you had to scoop away sauce just to find the chicken.    Everything was just so disappointing as I used recall this pace was decent.  But once again like other places I've been to. The best thing I had on the menu was the bread and cinnamon/honey butter.

Love this place... Highly recommend. Bummer that they are closed on Tuesdays as that's when I seem to crave it the most. Lol.  Always taste fresh. Staff is friendly.  Love the small local feel.  The Pho is delicious every time. I love the P3 which has brisket as steak while my girlfriend love the P8-seafood Pho.  They do get pretty busy during peak times, but trust me it is worth the wait.  I never knew soup could pack such a flavorful punch.

Easily best Italian food in 70 mile radius.    Absolutely one of my favorites.  It is very unassuming from the outside as its in a strip mall behind Discount Tire, but it packs a punch.  Its a small local business the wife is one of the servers and is the sweetest lady ever.  I have been here a few times and the service is always excellent.    For the food:  it is pricey so it's not an every day place, but worth the splurge on a date night or special occasion.  Everything taste fresh with high quality ingredients.  The dinner specials are always different and well put together to fuse food, flavor, and overall dining experience.  Please start off with the mussels with white sauce. They are some of the best I've ever had.  As soon as you taste the pasta you can tell its cooked Al Dente which is so much better. .    I encourage everyone to go here to not only support a local business, but to experience excellent cuisine.

Have been here a few times and this is the great review I have left.  It gets fairly busy here but patio is open seating and we were able to find a table within 15 minutes.  The patio/bar area is very large so you shouldn't have a problem and there is a nice seating area around a fire pit as well that just adds to why sitting outside is the fall is the way to go.    While everyone was friendly my only grip was that service was a bit slow, but it wasn't anything that ruined the night.  We ordered our meal and while mine was excellent, ( steak cooked a perfect medium-rare ) with excellent mixed vegetables.  My girlfriend ordered a sirloin and she wanted it medium-rare, but it was clear once she cut into that is was very rare.  While she did her best to eat around the rarest parts we did mention this to our server.    This next part is why I'll come back.  While they offered to re-cook her steak she graciously declined since we had to leave.  The waitress then came back and had offered us two free desserts as a small consolation prize.   While it was incessant we were more than pleased with the service provided and will have no reservation about ever coming back.

Great tasting Pizza everything.  Simple ingredients executed to perfection.  One of my favorite pizza places in AZ.  if your looking for great tasting NY style thin crust look no further.   Pepperoni, sun dried tomatoes, and basil pizza is so good.  Love the brick oven flavor.   Being able to watch them make your pizza just adds to the experience.  Highly recommend.

Love this place. I have been going since it opened. Love the food and my favorite beer is the Marźen.  Southwest egg rolls are excellent,  Cajun Pasta is outstanding, and the Apple bread pudding is amazing.  Love the staff, the atmosphere, and location.  Have been a Stein member for 6 years now and enjoy the tapping party's and brew dinners.  This is one of my go to favorite places.

If you do come here just sit at the bar top. Otherwise forget about getting decent service.    I do frequent here often as it's a decent sports bar very close to my home.  Like I mentioned my friends and I usually only sit at the bar top. Beer is ice cold and not a bad place to watch some games.    The food is your typical sub par bar food.  They have your blah nachos, hamburgers and what not.  Just "meh" all the around as far as food quality and options.    So, go for beer and sports, sit at bar top and you'll leave happy-ish...

First time here and must say it was a pleasant surprise. Very clean and friendly.  Received the "take me to paradise" pedicure and it was just that! It's was 4 of us in this visit (2 guys and 2 girls) and we all left very satisfied with the results.  The ambience is a little dull for guys as there isn't much to see except reading a magazine where I would have preferred at least a TV. But I guess that's to be expected with a predominately female environment .  But they do let you bring your own bottle of wine if you want which is a nice touch when you go with a group of people as we did. .  Would definitely be coming back here as the service was excellent and in the end that's what matters most!...

Now I see why this place has such bad reviews.    While I didn't have any food (thank goodness) the drinks and service were sub par.    Decided to have a few pre-flight drinks before take off around 8:30am. Wasn't busy by any means and there were three servers along with the bartender to cover.  Once seated we were greeted promptly but after that pretty much on our own.    Ordered a Bloody Mary which was ok. Seemed more tomato juice than actual mix or alcohol.  Almost V8 like. At least I got my nutrients I guess ( high five ).   Then waited 20 minutes for another drink. After the waitress would not come around we just ordered from the bartender two margaritas.  These were even worse. Tasted of dirty sink water and expired margarita mix. Couldn't taste and tequila.  Pretty much forced it down out of principle since it was 10 freaking dollars.    Safe to say on my next early flight I'll just stick with coffee from Starbucks.

Would gladly come here again and recommend this office to anyone else.   From the moment I walked in, was greeted by a friendly staff offering me something to drink or just a water. Nice change from other places I've been in the past.    Dr Heetland was excellent. Very knowledgeable and explained everything; not only in a manner easy to understand, but what would be the best for me for what I was hoping to accomplish.  Went through pros and cons of various lenses before offering his recommendations.   The other aspect that I absolutely enjoyed was upon finishing his exam he had the eye glass consultant greet me in the room. No waiting around forever for someone to finally be free to help choose my frames and lenses.    For that moment on the transition was smooth and again received excellent service from Ernesto.   Overall I was very pleased from start to finish. So glad I picked this place.

Wouldn't eat here even if it was free!!  Went there for lunch looking to support a local business.  BBQ was not good.  Huge disappoint.  Pulled pork was very salty, sauce was bland and tasted store bought.  Our coleslaw tasted days old and was very pickled. I ended up scooping it off my pork sandwich it was so bad.  Not sure what recipe they use for it, but I have never tasted any thing this bad. I love local businesses, but here is one place I won't go back.

Never again!!!!   Went here after having a nice dinner cause it was on my way home.   Immediately when I walked in this place is filthy.  Teen behind the counter wasn't rude as I understand it's not your dream job, but come on if you hate it that bad just quit.  I ordered a ice cream cone and as soon as he handed it to me it was half melted.  Clearly the refrigeration is equivalent with the rest of the place....ABYSMAL as in dire need of attention.  .      I'd rather walk to Safeway to buy ice cream then ever come back.

What is not to love about this lovely hidden gem.    Its shares a courtyard with the Perch Brewery (which is another hidden gem in itself).  I've been here a few times for breakfast and each time it's outstanding.  Very local feel where you can tell they care about their food and service.  It's nothing fancy just well executed.    It's a small place but even if you have to wait for a table you can just walk about the courtyard and enjoy the Birds on display from The Perch.   I recommend this place to any and everyone. It's off the Main Street and parking can get tricky if you go during peak hours, but it's worth the effort.

Where to start....First time experiencing iPic and wow.  Talk about the ultimate movie experience.  We had the premium seats( Leather chairs that recline with blanket and pillow ).  Plus wait service.  If you want to have a unique date night than the usual trip to the movies. This is the one and only way to do it.   It is a little pricey, but so worth it for that one movie you have to see in theaters. I will definitely be going back along with signing up for the free membership for extra perks and updates.     P.S. It's so comfortable and uh-mazing that don't be surprised if you get the urge to sleep.  I can see how people get lost in the comfort.

Great stop by when in the Scottsdale quarter.  I love coffee no secret there.  And I don't mean specialty coffee drinks I mean just simple black coffee with great roasted beans where the flavor speaks for itself.  This place has it all. They do have your fancier coffee drinks but don't shy away from the classic pour over. It's good morning in a cup!!   Great service, friendly staff, with charming decor.  Stop by for a quick cup before shopping you can't go wrong.

Great facility and definitely is among one of the best to watch spring training in AZ. Wide open concourse level, clean restrooms and they even provide free sun block lotion along the back concourse in front of the lawn section.    FYI, if you want to stay out of the sun during a day game I suggest you get seats on the west side between home plate and first. It's so worth it. Otherwise there is plenty good times to be had in the lawn, very affordable.

For being a chain restaurant, I really do love this place.   It's always consistent and taste delicious every time.   Some of our favorites are the Alfredo of the Dark pasta with chicken, the Big Rig with Sausage, the BBQ chicken pizza is outstanding.   And to top it off a pizza cookie for dessert.  What more can I say.  Great food, great prices, great service.

So bad on so many levels!!!  Went in during my lunch break and there were three people in the entire place. (Should have been my first clue).  We sit at the bar top and order our food within 5min.  Bartender was friendly so there is a plus I guess.  She completes our order and immediately prints us are tab as they do at the bar top.  The time stamp on the receipt was 11:56am.    For this placing being completely dead we didn't get our food; which was just half order of wings until 12:45.   All we had was wings not that complicated. The bar tender didn't even acknowledge that we had been waiting for over 45 min. She found every task imaginable to occupy her time so as not to have to deal with us waiting.    Once the food did arrive it was avg at best.  Not worth waiting 45 min for.  I now see why this place was dead.  Don't even bother.    Wouldn't recommend to anyone. It'll be faster to buy a six pack of beer at Sprouts across the way, buy raw wings and cook them yourself!!!

"Rated best dessert in Arizona". And yep they do not lie.  Don't even waste your time at any other Gelato spots as Frost is in a league of there own. Every flavor no matter which you choose is outstanding.   My favorite is the Salted Carmel.  If you have a sweet tooth this is definitely the spot to ca that craving.

A little hidden gem in South Chandler.   I haven't had the pleasure of dining in so this will be based solely on take out orders.   I have ordered take out quite a few times so feel it is time to review this place.    Service: each time I've ordered they are always friendly over the phone and the first time where eager to answer any questions I had about the menu.  My order has always been correct and hot n fresh. No issue here!!!   Food: I've had the Tandoori Chicken and the Chicken Tiki Masala. Both of these are absolutely outstanding.  I want to order something different each time, but can't bring myself since these are so dang delicious. I don't have much experience with Indian food, but the few places I've had this place is excellent. Great flavor. And the naan bread is made fresh as well. I recommend the Garlic Naan. Yummo!!!!

Hidden gem in downtown Chandler.    This place is excellent.  It's been featured during Restaurant week a few times and now I can see why.   Great atmosphere, great food, and excellent drink choices.  You can either choose to sit at a table or the lounge sofa area by the fire place. (Great spot come winter).    They have live music on weekends and it fits perfectly with the ambiance. Usually a mix of new age and jazz.    The staff and service was top notch. Extremely friendly, helpful, and eager to offer suggestions.    Another reason why Downtown Chandler is one of my favorite hangout spots.  You can't go wrong bringing a date here or just enjoying some drinks with friends.  Will most definitely be back again and again.

Wow what has happened to this place?!?  Not sure if they have just gotten lazy these past few months but  something is clearly wrong. I have gone a few times in the last month and each time the quality of the food has really gone done. The freshness seems to be gone. The marinara sauce now taste like cheap Prego store bought sauce.  I ordered some Lasagna and it seems they dumped an entire jar of sauce on it. Couldn't even see the Lasagna anymore I had to scoop away most of it just to be able to get to the pasta.    Once I started eating it it was bland and again lacked any anything of decent taste and flavor. Highly disappointing as when it first opened it was very good.  Now the best thing I've eaten these past few months has been their complementary bread.

Below avg.  and highly disappointing. .    Came in during lunch. Wasn't busy by any means but yet still waited over 45 minutes for 4 simple orders of wings.    Service was ok. Wasn't terrible considering she was training someone but could have been better, she didn't even acknowledge the fact that our order was taking longer than usual other than it'll be right out. When clearly that wasn't the case.  .   Once our order came. The wings lacked all flavor.  I ordered Medium and Honey Chipotle and medium just tasted like breaded chicken breast.  The honey chipotle, same bread in with a drizzle of syrup style sauce.    Can't say I would come back unless it was extremely convenient.

Same staff and food as when it was Los Favs.    This place is ok when your craving a quick fix or after a night drinking.  My biggest complaint is the food seems to always have to much salt.  Lately I'll only order a sausage breakfast burrito as the bacon burrito is like eating salt rocks.   Staff is always super friendly and the place is clean. Although if you come during cleaning I suggest take out as the bleach smell can be overwhelming.

What is there not to LOVE about this Texas BBQ.  First off, it is not misleading as it feels like a country store from when you first walk in.    One of the best things about this place are the bbq smokers right behind the registers.  You can watch them pull out the meats and cut it right there.   Then they serve it by the 1/2lb. And will serve your BBQ on top of butcher paper.  No fancy plates or bells and whistles.  They know their BBQ will speak for itself.   Seating is almost picnic style as there are just different picnic tables and chairs through out.    Service is always outstanding and prices are more than reasonable.  Definitely recommend coming here if your in the area and even worth the drive if your not.  Also if they haven't sold out of Prime Rib definitely get some as it's one of the best around!!

Love this place.    I've been a few times and can't believe I've never written a review.  Harvey's is Gilbert's own Gastropub.  They have great food with great beer choices.  They usually rotate their taps so to always nice to try a different beer than you otherwise wouldn't get a chance to and a normal bar.    They have live music on weekends which is usually a full band.  It can get a little loud in there but save the conversations for the park and just enjoy the atmosphere.    I've had the joy of coming here during St Pattys day and usually the chandler/Gilbert Irish band will stop by and play their bag pipes for about 30+ min.  Trust me if you've never had this opportunity to hear them you MUST.  It's indescribably amazing.    P.S.  The Fried Egg Burger will put you in a oh so worth it food coma.

Looking for a local coffee shop with an excellent barista.  Then look no further. Don't the the exterior fool as its looked in a strip mall.  Once inside and once you place your order; you'll see why people go out of there way to stop here.  Excellent coffee all around.    Everyone is always friendly and happy to help in any way.  Great place to sit with your laptop while enjoying a cup of joe.

What is there not to love.  A staple when your ever in Chicago and now here in AZ.  I love this place with an unhealthy, but necessary obsession.  Every Time I go no matter how hard I fight it I must get an Italian beef extra wet with melted mozzarella and a Chicago dog.   I just have to cause even though that is so much food I'll regret it if I don't.   Even if you only come once it's still amazing.    It does get pretty busy, but has always been worth the wait for me.

Always love a good hamburger.   Nothing fancy just great execution.     Been here a few times and every time I have a great meal.   I don't eat fast food often but when I want a burger its either here or In n Out.   I love the simplicity and the great taste.  I usually order a little hamburger.  Don't let the name full you as this is a regular burger and not small by any means.  If you order the regular size it is a lot of food FYI.  Also for the fries.  A small is also more than enough as I usually spilt those and we still end up with fries left over. My very first visit I made the mistake of ordering my own and didn't even make a dent.   The Cajun fries are good and I love how it's something different than just regular fries.  But whatever you decide to get take you can't go wrong.

Overall a great and fun experience.    Came here with my little pumpkin to explore and try something new.  I recommend arriving when the opens as it wasn't busy at all and had ample space to enjoy ourselves.   Butterflies galore. I did not expect so many and so many varieties. You literally walk around and they are flying everywhere landing where they please.  They have a pleasant Koi pond right in the middle where you can enjoy a seat next to these beautiful fish. It is a bit humid in there as they regulate the temps for the butterflies so dress accordingly.   Once you've had your fill make your way through the cafe to a small portion or the aquarium that is open. Just a few fish tanks with fresh water fish and a sting ray pen where you can touch them ( wash your hands prior ) they have a sink nearby.   Had a great time. Only downside is it is pricey for what you get.  Sort of seen it once I'm good not sure I'd be back unless there was a major attraction change.

Great place that fits right in with downtown Gilbert.   First off, I love the feel of the building. Makes you feel your in California next to the beach.  The place is very clean with a modern/hipster feel.   That have a decent beer selection and their personal pitchers is the way to go!! Hands down. You tell me personal and beer pitcher in the same sentence and I'm sold. You had me at hello!!   Now for the tacos!! Some say they are small and they can be a bit pricey, but these pack a lot of flavor and and order of 3 will more then get the job done.  I love how they let you mix n match. I love the chicken, barbacoa, and the steak. Can't go wrong.   But for all the love of tacos do not skimp on the sides. The Mexican corn is out of this world delicious and the black beans are legit!!    I came more often when I lived in the area, but still try and find time to find my way back as often as I can.

First let me review the food/service.   Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. And while she did make a small mistake on my order it wasn't anything to gripe about.   I ordered the bacon cheddar burger medium. Burger was a bit over cooked and while I ordered the fries extra crispy they still were soggy. A little disappointing as if had Mimi's before in Chandler, but this location doesn't compare.   Now to the real issue.     This place smells!! Not like in a rotten way but it smells of old everything kind of way. I walk in and immediately my senses are being Kamakazi'd by a pungent smell of dust/moth balls odor.  It's hard to explain but it smelled like an abandoned home that hasn't been clean,vacuumed in years (just dust on dust on dust).  I hate to say but it smelled like a retirement home/community.  It was so strong that our clothes even took the smell with us when we left.   Never had an experience quite like this at a restaurant, but safe to say I won't be back.

FINALLY, got to give this place a go and I must say I'm hooked.   Place was crazy busy on early Sunday afternoon and parking, well FUGGET a'bout it!!  Friggin nightmare and had to park in the motel behind the restaurant.  Luckily powered through and made my way in. Seems I was rewarded by the parking gods as I was able to find two seats at the bar top in the tasting room just as two people were leaving.   Bar tenders very very friendly and all too eager to recommend which burger was their favorite and why.  And of course what do I order. The chicken drumsticks confit. Now these little drumlets of black magic with habanero mustard sauce were very good I think I'll stick with a burger next time. (Wasn't a big fan of the small shards of bone in the drumlets). Just a personal preference for me.    My buddy ordered the trail blaze burger and allowed me a bite and yep. Burgers are where it's at with house made chips or fries made in duck fat. Mmmmm   Now for the beer.  I only had the Refugee IPA and instantly it is now one of favorites on a very short list.  Clearly American Wilderness has put a lot of work into their food and beers. High quality all around with great execution and flavors.    Until next time--I'm talking to you Peanut Butter and Jalapeño jelly burger!!!!

Very unique place and has definitely carved out its own niche in the heart of downtown Chandler.   Huge outdoor area. So far I really enjoyed everything about The Perch.  had the Ginger Style beer and it was shockingly refreshing.  I would classify this place in the GastroPub style- (creative menu an excellent beer choices).   There were out of a few styles when I went, but they also weren't your every day choices and could see limited quantities running out quickly.  I already loved going to downtown Chandler for San Tan Brewery and this is just another reason why it's a must go to area any day of the week.

Grab your time card and get ready to clock in cause you're about do work!!   This place is messy goodness so don't be shy of the bibs.  The mess is warranted and makes the experience all the better.   Service was exceptional and our waitress excellent at breaking  it down for us first timers.   We ordered the hush puppies, which other reviews on here will tell are out-freaking-standing.  Then also had the 1-lb of the King Crab which was excellent.   I truly can't wait to return and dig in with unadulterated abandonment.

Drinks galore!!   The drinks menu has so many choices I was on overload.  Whiskey to the left, Bourbon to the right, Scotch at the bottom (ahhhh the choices) I want them all.  Lol I have been wanting to come here for some time and so glad I finally did.  Great atmosphere, friendly staff and excellent drink choices for every one from the unique fruity/speciality cocktails to the people who take it neat!!   They have something for all. As someone who thoroughly enjoys a great Bourbon and Scotch they have it all.  I am so glad I finally found a bar that carries Stanahan's Colorado Wiskey. It's hard to find out here and is worth it once you do.    I was so entranced by the booze choice I'm pretty sure this place also has food ;) lol. Enjoy and can't wait to come back.    Oh and make a reservation. It's easier to get in.

Just average in every sense of the word..  Don't get me wrong I've had Firehouse plenty in other locations, but this location is not on par.     Seems like the quality is suffering due to its location and the staff unable to handle the crowds of being in such a busy area.  Every time I've ordered my sandwich is drenched in mayo and lettuce. No resemblance of a decent ratio.  Just thrown together to keep the line moving.    Try not to eat at this location unless your out options or for pure convenience.

Wow!!! Was in here for the first time and off the bat felt had a warm welcome and super friendly staff.  The cupcake selection was excellent. So many to choose from.   I've had cupcakes at other popular places in town (Gigi's, Sprinkles, Coffee Shop) and for me these were so much better.  Super moist and not overloaded with frosting. The right ratio of cupcake to frosting.   I definitely feel that whenever I have that sweet tooth craving I have no reservation about driving out of my way to come here again.

This place is a must stop if you're in Gilbert.  Everything was outstanding.   The server was very helpful when we mentioned it was our first visit.  He went as far as even brought us a sample of the lobster bisque to see what we thought. And it was freaking outstanding.  Extremely rich as it had bits of lobster in it, but wow oh so good.     I ordered the King past dish and my girlfriend ordered the High Tide.  Both were excellent and no complaints.     It is on the pricey side, but was worth every penny.  We will be going back again and again.  Next time I have my eyes in the lobster mac.  I hear it's uh-mazing!!

Love this office.  I have been coming here for what seems like 10 years and I'll never change. Don't care how far I have to drive this will always be my dentist. Dr. Kohler and his staff are always friendly and make every visit a comfortable one.  I recommend this office to all my friends.  Even the new addition of Dr. Lee was smooth and he is excellent in his own right.

What's not to love!!! This place is a great place whether to just hang it with friends or come in on a date.    I've been here twice and both times have throughly enjoyed my experience.  I'd suggest making a reservation ahead whether calling it in or using Open Table. So much easier once you arrive.    Service has been excellent both times and the quality of food delicious. Great ambiance all around.  Great HH options and the pretzels and cheese fondue were freaking dynamite!!! Do yourself a favor and get them!!

Wow, unfortunately what a let down.    This was my second visit came here a while back for some drinks and had a pleasant experience I figured we'd stop again and this time try some tacos.  Place wasn't busy my any means as there were tables open. We sat at the bar top.    The bar top was filthy, food crumbs and dirty glasses everywhere not just where we were sitting.  The bar tender came and I thought he'd wipe the top down. Nope my mistake for thinking he would do it without me having to ask.   I look over to the end of the bar and the entire corner was evidently conquered by an army of dirty dishes, pint glasses, plates, and pitchers.  The bar tender just went about his business taking orders and ignoring the mess. He brought us our beers and once again didn't even make an attempt to wipe away the previous three meals that were all over the top.    My desire to eat quickly faded, as I wondered if they were this messy out in the open I can only imagine how filthy they are behind the scenes.     Such a disappointment as this place has potential and I like the garage decor and feel.  But I will never go back to a place that blatantly disregards cleanliness.

This place is Uhhh-Mazing.   Who doesn't love to throw back a Few drinks while summing their inner Tiger Woods!!   Staff was exceptional and couldn't have been more professional and courteous to answer all questions and put on a demo for first timers.    The food is quite delicious so don't be skeptical.  This is a great night out and you will have lots of fun. Don't feel like you need to be a Tour Pro to enjoy your night.  Keep in mind, "Everyone sucks at golf, others just wear better gear". Don't be discouraged and swing away.

Definitely a hot spot for breakfast or brunch.  This place has a very urban/contemporary fits in with the college crowd feel.    As soon as you walk in, everything is vibrant from the decor to the friendly staff.  Everyone was exceptional from a service stand point.   They have so many speciality cocktails and while I didn't get to try one this time around they are definitely in my radar for next time.  That's right....there will most certainly be a next time!!!!   I ordered the "OMG French Toast" and they did pack quite the flavor punch.   They come with mascarpone butter and a Carmel syrup glaze tops with fresh strawberries and coconut shavings.  While the serving wasn't large it was just right since towards the end of the meal it was getting almost too sweet too sugary.  So be warned of your not big into sweet stuff.      Prices are a tad on the higher side, but nothing that was a deal breaker. You can at least tell that the increase in cost goes to fresh ingredients and excellent attention to detail in the little things.    I hear they might be opening one in downtown Gilbert and can't wait as that's a little closer for me, but either way I will be coming back to taste other delightful items on the menu and throwback some cocktails!!! SUNDAY FUNDAY DONE RIGHT!!!!

Nice change from what used to be here.  Came in for the first time during lunch and was highly optimistic since it was pretty busy.    Got a table right away and server was nice.  Nothing to write home home about, but on par with decent service.     Wish I could have come to enjoy a beer or two as their selection is pretty impressive. Both draught and bottle beers.  I will be coming back just to have a few.  I ordered the Hangover burger.  And talk about a lot of food.  It was pretty delicious but not sure if it was $12 delicious. The standard fries are steak fries.  And normally I hate these as they are always soggy and bland. But they were good. Little crispy while still soft.   Wonder if that will be consistent every time.    While this place seems pricey for just a burger I had a pleasant experience and seems like a good place to catch a few games, beers, and a burger.

What is not to love.  Everything about Peixoto speaks to an amazing family who truly cares about their craft.    This unique coffee shop just adds more charm to the downtown Chandler area. To be in this are and not stop by for a quick coffee is a shame.  From crop to cup is their motto and you can definitely taste it.   I love all types of coffee, but usually will rate a place based on just a simple pour over. Black no frills, sugars or creams, and Peixoto does not disappoint.  Staff is extremely friendly and eager to answer questions or recommend their seasonal flavors or infused lattes with produce from Agritopia.    Oh and for the hot days their Nitro Press cold brew is legit and should be the standard for all coffee shops.

Huge fan of Bosa Donuts and so glad they finally opened one near me.   These are literally the best donuts in Az.  What I love is you can taste that these are made from scratch and so fresh.  It doesn't matter which location you choose the staff are always friendly and eager to answer any questions.   I have been going to Bosas since I was a little kid and it's so glad to know that a local business has thrived for so long and is doing really well and opening new locations every year.

Love this place. Be have had take out once ordered the Rebel. Was absolutely fresh and delicious. Very nice change from the ordinary stuff around.  By the end my hunger was more then satisfied and I didn't feel like a greasy blob afterward.   Came back a few weeks later and dined in.  Service was excellent. Line was a tad long but moved quickly. The hostess/cashier was very friendly and eager to answer all question.  Ended up going with the Flying Avocado this time and wow once again was delicious.  Probably my new go to wrap.    Now all I can hope is they open on in south Chandler/Gilbert area closer to me.

Yum yum yum.  Aside from Tacos lol Burgers are one of my favorites.    It was my first time trying Smash Burger and I'm hooked.  I ordered the BBQ Bacon and it was simple yet perfectly executed.  Nothing crazy which is what makes a great burger in my book.    Now while the burger was great my favorite part of the meal was the String Fries.  Can I get an AMEN!! They were crispy and well seasoned.  What more could I ask for.    Can't wait to go back and try something else along with a shake.

Wow,  new place in town is giving every other Mexican place a run for its money.    Carlitos is quickly making a name for itself and its here to stay.   It's small so tables can be hard to come by, but that just tells you it's worth the wait or hell just get take out cause it's that's good.    They not only have some of the best street tacos in CG, but some of the best I've had including the Phoenix area.  The carne asada is very good. Not chewing or full of fat or greasy.  The salsa is fresh and a great addition to whatever you order.    The service was excellent as well. Vey fire fly and happy to bring you more chips and salsa.   Why go on a juicing diet when there are tacos this good in the world?

Nothing is better then a coffee shop where they truly take pride in their craft and Provisions would give any coffee shop a run for its money.  Dan the barista was excellent. Not only in his service, but overall friendliness. Easy to talk to and ask about the shop and his ideas on good coffee.    Located in south Gilbert this is a hidden gem that is worth the drive. Please don't waste your time at a coffee chain just for pure convenience.  Tried their Habanero Mocha and it was delicious. Right amount of kick with great coffee flavor also enjoyed a great IPA. Can't go wrong here.   Safe to say I'll be back plenty of times.

Pomo in Gilbert delivers just as the location in downtown Phoenix.     I came here not sure if I would be experiencing the same service and high quality pizza I have come to love from the downtown location.  And they fired on all cylinders without a hitch.    First off, it gets very busy so plan on waiting accordingly (45min-1hr).  Nice thing is they take your phone# and text you when ready so was nice having a drink across the way while we waited.  For the reviews on here about the place being small. Well that's what makes it awesome. The downtown location I feel is even smaller but I love the closeness it brings to the restaurant and keeping the feel of downtown Gilbert a modern local feel.    The pizza was excellent. Quality ingredients with a perfect done crust. The service was just as outstanding  they were extremely busy during my visit, but everyone not just our waitress made sure sure all our needs were met.    I love Pomo downtown Phoenix and safe to say Pomo in Gilbert is a hit.

What's not to love about 24hr breakfast!!!! This place is new so already it's nice,clean, and vibrant.  I came during negotiations off goes so didn't have to deal with the ridiculous crowds during peak mornings.    Ordered a simple breakfast with eggs and buttermilk pancakes. Just your standard stuff and it hit the spot. Nothing outrageous just breakfast for when your craving it at 10pm or early morning.    Staff was very friendly from the greeter to the waitress.

Never have had a bad experience either in the theater or with customer service.   Personally for me I at least always count on the consistency from Harkins no matter which one you visit experience is always the same.

Finally got to eat here and wow this might be one of my new favorite lunch spots during the week.    For me everything was so much better than Paradise or Panera. You walk in and it's clean, modern, yet homely feeling. Right off the bat they entice you with a cornucopia of desserts just calling your name. It's this genius marketing tactic that had me ordering a Cannoli along with my sandwich. Mmmm definitely hit the spot and put me over the full meter.   I ordered the turkey, avocado on focaccia bread. Wow this thing was huge. Next time I'll order a half sandwich. But bread was fresh and soft. Overall I'd easily order again.    Until next time. Already thinking of which dessert I'll get.

Yep it's official. I am addicted. Save the intervention as this needs to be experienced by all.   I can't say this enough finally a great cycle experience in Chandler.  I came here for a private ride event last week and once again the intensity, the competitiveness, the overall experience is unmatched.  Everything about CycleBar promotes a top notch ride.   They proved water bottles, towels , and even cycle shoes if you need them.   You buy classes in packages not a monthly subscription.  The more classes you buy the more you save.

Their Burrito game is crazy strong!!!   I have been wanting to try this place since the opened and holy moly why did I wait so long.  They promote fresh food done right and trust me they deliver.   I tried to order the Carne Asada Double H and they were sold out at 3:30pm. While I was bummed I couldn't get my Carne Asada on, right away I knew when they say fresh they mean it. So on to the next choices.  I settled on a Chili Verde, a RCB (brisket in a NM RED CHILI), and just to try it a Choizo & hash. All great choices and easily repeat orders.   You can watch them make your burritos right behind and the tortillas remind me of home. Everything was packed with flavor, not greasy and  so delicious I almost ate my hand!!! I would have taken a picture to show off, but couldn't slow down eating to take it. Sorry I'm not sorry about it!! Lol   These aren't your baby in a tortilla size burrito so if that's your thang, this may not be for you!   Everyone was friendly and eager to answer questions.   Can't wait until I return. The motto on the back of their shirts read "Step up your burrito game" and they don't lie!!

JETS JETS JETS Pizza definitely put a smile on my face and my belly.   Have heard great things about this place and their deep dish style pizzas.  I'm more of a thin crust fan myself and while they also do serve thin crust here (I see you thin crust for next time). I decided to order a deep dish and give that a go.   They have an Apple App and don't know about the rest of you, but I love ordering through my phone and not having to speak to someone while I'm busy at work or after a long day. Score for convenience Jets!! The app was fairly simple to order but compared to say the Corporate chains out there the app could use a bit work. Which I'm sure time will fix.    Ordered my pizza (JETS FAVORITE- pepperoni deep dish) and promptly received an email with my pick up time. You can choose what seems like 8 different crust choices. And while I heard turbo crust is best I decided on the butter crust since my arteries obviously wouldn't be clogged enough with a deep dish pizza.  I walked in and immediately wish the smell came in candle form.  I also realized they serve by the slice. Hells yeah!! Got my 8" square deep dish and on my way.    Opened that bad boy once I got home and.......Lets just say I got pizza wasted, it was glorious.  Holy Moly Pizza Pepperoni... The crust was out of bounds and I could have just eaten that. The cheese was perfect and not too salty. The sauce did seem a tad sweet for my liking but no deal breaker by any means.   Yep, safe to say JETS PIZZA will be my stop for quick pizza over Papas or Barros.  Glad I tried the deep dish and not sure I could eat that every time, but New York style thin crust. Oh yes you are my next on my hit lis tand you don't even know it yet.

Finally another great bar/pub restaurant in the San Tan Mall area.   I've been to the Thirsty Lion in Tempe plenty of times and have always had a pleasant experience and this location was no different. Not sure why the bad reviews. I would think people would expect long wait times when a place first opens.    I came in on a Sunday early afternoon and promptly found a seat at the bar (always my preferred seating location for day drinking =). Service was good and and bartender Natalie was friendly and helpful. Even recommending a few of her favorite drinks.   Day drinker beware. Drinks are pricey and will quickly add up as they are delicious and go down easy. Recommend the good ol'Moscow Mule. Great for these hot days ahead. But switch to beer as they are 9 a pop.   Was disappointed they didn't have the MLB package as it is sort of a sports bar with tvs all around, but not a deal breaker. I didn't eat this time around but can't imagine I'd be disappointed as everything else was on par with my expectations.

Intense intense.....INTENSE!!!  thank you Yelp and CycleBar for allowing us to take part in this trip to purgatory.  Yes ma'am can I have another!!  Heather our instructor was fierce and was all business.  Be sure to bring a time card with you because you are about to do work.  Up, down, push-ups, sprint, one more gear Come on!! DIG DEEP!!   You get pushed to the edge and just when you can't anymore you dig and push some more!! Great motivation from Heather!!   So glad they opened this in Chandler near me. Perhaps I'm still in a daze of soreness but I will be signing up for classes on the regular.   Thanks again Haliey, Yelp, and CycleBar. Ride or die or better yet Ride and feel like dying. I love it!!
