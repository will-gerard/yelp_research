My company uses Citron catering quite a bit to bring in food for large meetings and trainings. Every time I have found the food to be mediocre.  Today I took a bite of the Mac and Cheese and while I didn't want to spit it out, it was not good enough to be worth eating. Mac and Cheese is a particularly fattening dish, and I am not going to indulge unless it tastes good enough to be worth it  That is the way I feel about all the food I have had from them (Burgers, Bacon, Breakfast Potatoes), it's good enough to eat, but I don't really want to. Now when I see the Citron logo on food that is brought in, I usually choose to eat my own lunch.

I have come here a bunch of times and decided it is time to write a review.   I have tried many things on the menu, including the falafel, shawarma, gyro and chicken kebob and they were all great!  Literally the BEST chicken shawarma I have every had in my entire life (including the when I was in the middle east). The gyro is also really good.  I always sub salad for tabouleh because the salad dressing is amazing.   I must come here once a week for a chicken shawarma plate with rice, hummus and salad!  Highly Recommended!

So almost every day I see someone flipping a sign on Rural for Jamie's Pizza and Pitas, so I decided it was time to try it.  I ordered the Chicken Shawarma pita and French Fries.  The Chicken Shawarma was awful. The chicken did not taste anything like any shawarma I have ever had (bad thing) and the hummus was "powdery" and equally as bad.  Then the french fries we salty but with no flavor, and hard with no crunch. Needed ketchup to be edible.  0/5.  Never coming back.

Wave is great! I have been using them for months and they always send very nice cleaners who are easy to talk to! They will usually perform special requests at no extra charge too!   They always go above and beyond what I expect even going as far to clean the dishes is my sink and put them in the dishwasher (did not ask, nor expect this). They have even vacuumed my furniture. They actually like cleaning and have pride in their work. They won't leave until they are happy with the job they have done, even if they have to stay a little extra time. They also do this for a fraction of the cost of some of their competitors.  Another big plus is they allow me to pay them using PayPal!  I highly recommend them, and will be using them as my go to maid/cleaning service for years to come!

I've been here twice, once with my dad and for with a company function.  Both times I felt the same way. The actual place is great. They have a nice patio with ping pong and tetherball!  They also have a great beer selection. Lots of taps and bottles, and they usually have something unique or hard to find. Last time I was there they had one of my favorites, Firestone Double Jack.  Also their apps are great! The wings are really good and they might have the best pretzels with cheese I've ever had at a bar.  The reason they don't get more stars is I have not really enjoyed much of their actual entrees. I've tried some burgers and brats and nothing was that special that would make me want to eat a meal there.  Overall a great place to meet with friends, grab beers and pretzels and then play some games! Just not a place I would want to eat a full meal at again.

I just are here with my parents and we were a little worried when we got there. From the outside it looked small at a little sketchy. The B health code rating didn't help.   Do not be fooled by the external appearance,  the food here was great. Seriously the best drunken noodles I have ever had in my life.  Portions were good too. The only minor thing was I ordered a 5/5 for spiciness and it wasn't as hot as I expected.  My parents were happy too.    Our waitress was extremely pleasant and gave us a free bowl of ice cream!  I can't wait to come come back!

I have been here a few times for drinks, but was worried about coming here to eat after reading some of the reviews.  A co-worker told me it was good so I decided to give their Taco Wednesday a try. I had the Chronic Taco and the Fried Chicken/Mac and Cheese Taco. The chronic was just average, but the other taco was great! The chipotle sauce was surprising spicy and the chicken was very moist.  The waitress was very nice and gave us free chips even though we didn't order drinks. The food came out pretty quickly too.  Overall a solid and filling lunch for $10.
