This isn't a bad airport, considering how many of our US airports have been neglected (I'm talking about you, DIA!) It's easy to get around, but you do have to like to walk. The airport is clean, well-maintained, and convenient to town. It's a hike to the rental car facility, make sure you allow time for a decent bus ride.

I now remember why I haven't been to an IHOP in 35 years. Grim food. Grim service. Grim coffee. I'll happily wait another 35 years before I return.

We had lunch here with the In-laws today. Highlights: the wait staff is awesome. Fast, friendly, fun; everyone here is ON it. Lowlights: the food. It's not terrible, but kind of meets expectations of a diner in a strip mall. Weak coffee, white bread, smaller portions, nothing was particularly great. Nothing really sucked; but was just mediocre. They must be doing something right, it was crowded and my in-laws like it. I'd rather go without eating than visit here again.

This is a great place for a standard- issue bacon and eggs breakfast. A freindly and efficient staff handles tables inside and out with grace and humor. Clearly the plethora of regulars speak volumes about the quality of the food and the service.

There are liquor stores, and there are liquor stores. This place has spoiled me for anywhere else. Huge collection of great wines and beers, helpful staff. I wish they'd open one nearby in CO. Next time we visit the in-laws, I may stop here first!

It's easy to see why this place is so popular. The ambience is relaxed yet upscale and the staff is accommodating and friendly. The sea bass was exceptionally good, and the angel hair pasta was perfect. My rib eye tasted great, although it was slightly over-cooked. Portions are generous and the deserts are exceptional.  It might be somewhat of a stretch to consider this a world-class restaurant; but you can take anyone here with complete confidence they will have an enjoyable experience.

Despite the modest appearance from the street, Yoli's is a real find. Thank you, Yelp! While visiting PHX, and lost and hungry, I searched Yelp for the closest breakfast place. We parked with some trepidation. Walking through the gate, we entered breakfast heaven. Great food, awesome service, good coffee. If I lived in Phoenix, I'd eat here multiple times a week.
