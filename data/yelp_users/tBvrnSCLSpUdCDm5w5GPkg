This is a great place to eat and drink wine. The food is delicious and the service is always wonderful. I have been here several times and I love it. The cheeses are spectacular and I am not even the biggest cheese fan. The desserts are great too.

We have had season tickets to the Pops series for three years now. We love us our music! Last night we saw again the wonderful jim Witter who did a tribute to one of my favs of all times, Simon and Garfunkle. ( I know every word to every song they ever wrote. Yes I know nerd alert here) JW usually does a Billy Joel and Elton John tribute. Ha! Last year I even got to sing and dance on stage to Crocodile Rock. Na-na-na-na-na  Na-na-na-na-na!  Don't ask, but life goal number 1 completed! LOL! Well as far as last night goes, all I can say is that we were rocking the place. ( Well ok as far as one can rock out to Simon and Garfunkle) I am sure the conductor was cringing at how rowdy the third row was. Teeehhhee! We were jamming out to the music.  ( Yes sorry handsome conductor man. I know it is the Symphony and probably made you cringe with all that classical training in the house. Then the NY, Alice Cooper gang hooligan types came in-hahaha thus why I like the Pops more than the classical. I will go to classical shows too so really I am just kidding. However. I do love the pops so much more. I know, I know, I feel like "Just Jack" from Will and Grace. I love me my musical theater and showtunes, Gleek here.      Last year I even got to see my all time musical theater hero diva perform,  Patti Lupone. SIGH! Got to meet her after the show too. Thanks Phoenix Symphony for that photo op! (Life goal number two, check!) Advice, now if you could only get Mandy I would truly be in heaven. ( Life goal check number 3 perhaps?)     However, I do went to point out they do have something for everyone with an eclectic yearly calendar of different musical genres. I do worry about cultural Arts programs and budget cuts in Az so hope people continue to support them in any fashion. I know it is not NY or London but it's still good!  I also love it when I see the young set being introduced to the Symphony. We sat next to a delightful 13 year old young man last night. He was rocking out with us. ( Ok Dad listens to S/G in the car every day. But at least the boy didn't  appear to be having his teeth pulled out by being there)  So to all of my fellow music lovers, check it out, support local Arts, and enjoy!  Oh an afterthought- The person who sings with Jim ( can't remember his name) does the meanest, most awesome, best impression of Edith Bunker ever. I have no idea how a man can even hit a high note like that. If you ever have the chance to see him do this I would strongly advise you to do so. It is so fun!

You can not give zero stars on Yelp but Zero is the reality. This is a review only for our student field trip booking experience. Warning--- don't do it. This had to be the worse experience of my 15 years of teaching in the classroom and booking field trips. There was one issue after another ranging from no calls back, to rude staff, to hang ups, to transfer after transfer to answering machine, to dial tone.  ARGHHH and frustration abound. They now make all teachers wanting a Title One field trip to go to a worthless class. No exceptions even by experienced educators.  I mean really???? A class on how to learn how to go on a field trip? "ReallyTIMES2?" This is is a slap in the face for educators. It would take too long to explain all the problems we had but rest assured it was the worse customer service in the world trying to book our field trip. It took us three months to finally close the deal. There is absolutely no excuse for this. You would think in this economy they would be happy for our business. One phone call had me hanging up on the woman because she was so horribly rude! I will update the review after the trip, which I sure hope goes better than the entire ugly experience of booking it. We will never be going here again.

Mary Beth from the museum contacted me this morning after reading this review in an attempt to make my experience better. I was most impressed by the call. I will update my review after we take the trip. I appreciated the reach out.

The kids had a great time. Tons to do. if I could offer a suggestion they should have a worker at the Forces of Nature display at all times. Everywhere else is well staffed by nice, friendly, smart, enthusiastic, and helpful Docents. There was an Imagine Charter School attending the same day as us that were not supervised so caused problems with safety, especially at the Forces and the water/gears display. Besides that, we had a great time. Loved the Dinos!

The best service you will ever receive at any doctors office, hospital, or clinic in town. If you need Cardio services this is where you should go.

Super cool, eclectic, very old diner from the 1940's. I did not like the burger I got but to be fair I knew it was just me and not them. I got the PB Burger which I am guessing is an acquired taste that I have not yet acquired. Ha! So I wiped off the PB and devoured all the ingredients separately for this review. I was pretty happy with the results. All the ingredients were delish. The burger juicy and tasty. For some reason I was nuts about their pickles. lol. I love pickles but these were extra wonderful to me. I also liked their Brussel Sprouts. Super cool and friendly staff too.

I don't know, what I had to eat was just fine.I ordered a Chicken Salad sandwich and potato salad and it was pretty good. I really liked the Potato Salad. It is a fun, interesting and great place to go. Unique antique shops attached with the original soda fountain in the middle. I was enthralled with the history behind the whole place. The Wayne Newton story made me laugh out loud a bit. Yummy Chocolate German Soda. I have not had an Ice cream soda in about 30 years. They have egg creams too for my East Coast friends.

A valley staple. I am not the biggest BBQ or smoked meat fan but the food is good and the portions are huge. If you like BBQ and Soul food check it out. Their Sweet Potato Pie (and surprisingly potato salad) is extremely delish!

I would give it zero stars if I could. Everything about this place is beyond awful. From the minute I walked into a sub below zero, freezing clinic (Hey you do know people are sick right?) to the doctor who wanted me to tell him what medicine I wanted and diagnose myself, the experience was the worse ever. In fact all of these clinics are terrible. I only go because my insurance contracts with them. I try to avoid going to Urgent Care unless I am dying. The one on Dunlap has a tad better service if you must go. If you can go to another brand of clinics, please do. If you must go to Advanced- "STAY AWAY" from this one or the one in Maryvale.

Need your Bianco fix but don't want to wait in line for three hours or get in a fight because of a shortcutter? Eat here instead. Take out only and very limited menu but who cares there food is great! Lucky for me I live close by so I can bring it home. There sandwiches are made with all fresh ingredients and their bread is wonderful. Next door is a place called Lux Coffee House. Erick is a hoot. They are very good to their customers and I had the best Vanilla Latte every here. You can sit here with your Bianco sandwich and surf the net with your laptop. A small piece of paradise!!!!!!Be forewarned Bianco's is not cheap!

Why do people come here for such bad service? It is such a mystery to me.  It is always the same bad service. Yes, the food is good but the service is just awful. You would think they would get it together by now. Weird they place is always packed maybe people do not care that they are treated so badly? I have eaten here many times and it is always the same. I think I'm done with this place.   Update for 12/31/15 and 1/1/16  Early in day NYE Me- on Phone- "Hi are you open tomorrow on the holiday? I have out of town guests who want to revisit your place." Man who answered phone- I don't know. ( really?) hold on (Does not put me on hold and screams in my ear and across the restaurant apparently to get an answer) " Yes, we are open." Dead air space continues.  Me- "Ummmm, are you sure? What time?" Man- Repeat of above scene. By now I am deaf and wanting to drive down to show him where the hold button is located on a phone set.   Me- "Anything special going on?" Man- No. End call.   I call back and reconfirm they are open. Nothing is said about needing a reservation or a special menu either time.   Fast forward to 10pm-strangely my phone rings and the number is not one I recognize. i call back and it is Noodle Cafe   Me- Umm you called me? Are you calling to tell me you are closed. ( I never left my phone number. I thought maybe they were just using Caller Id. )  Lady- No, who is this? Me- Well someone called and I was just wanting to make sure you are still open tomorrow. lady- I can't imagine who would have called you. ( three seconds later) Me- in my mind I am thinking it is probably a phone glitch." Are you calling me back from your Caller Ids from the day?  Lady- No, do you have a reservation for tomorrow? Is that why you are calling?  Me- Sighs loudly. "No you called me. Do I need a reservation for tomorrow? I have never had one here before and we are coming in around noon.   Lady- No Me- Are you sure you are open? ( Skeptical) lady -Yes see you tomorrow.   Okay, you see where this is going right? Fast forward to New Year's Day. I enter the restaurant and see a sign for their special menu.  Ummm, what special menu?  Me- Hi we are a party of five for noon. I am a bit early. May you put down my name?  Lady- Do you have a reservation Me- No Lady- Sorry we are having a New Year's special and you need a reservation.   I am a most forgiving person with these things but every single time i visit this eatery there is an issue.  When everyone arrived We left and went to Grassroots, which was fabulous by the way! I will not be returning any time soon to Noodle Cafe, if at all.

We had a very nice evening last night. It is always great to have a Groupon so the deal was a great one. The servers were wonderful. A new server was being trained and she was doing great! I had their Tomato Basil soup. It says on the menu this is there specialty and I can see why. It sure was delish. My friend had the Parchment Paper Salmon which she said was great. I tried it. I am not a salmon lover but it had this mustard type sauce on it that I could probably drink and live on! -teehee! I would go back to try some of their other yummy looking food delights. The atmosphere is an upgrade sports bar type of decor so it was a little noisy. The only advice I have is that their bathroom was a tad nasty. Maybe clean it better AG? However,  I could have hit it at a bad time.

Great experience. I love my hair and so does everyone else. Found it with Deal Chicken and so happy with how my hair turned out. I have difficult, to say the least, non cooperating and very dry hair. My stylist gave me great advice. A'lyce knew her stuff and my hair looks wonderful. I went to the movies after and a young girl came up to me and said, "I love your hair. It is so healthy looking and shiny." Okay, no one has ever said that to me before ever in my entire life. lol. Great job A'lyce!

I guess Pastrami is the way to go here and I do not like that so can not offer a fair review on that. However, friends say it is pretty good. The sandwiches are fine but not a 5 star deli. They have a nice selection of foods and sandwich options. The desserts look good but I have not tasted any in a long time so not sure how yummy they are. I did not see any Black or White cookies nor Cannolli tonight but I think they have NY style Cheesecake now and again.   For my dinner tonight I had the Chicken Salad on an onion roll. I have had that a few times in the past and it has always been pretty good. It is not the best I have had but pretty good. I will leave it at that. They also have Knishes, which are hard to find in Phoenix.   The problem is this place is expensive for Phx standards. I just got back from NY and I paid more for three items here than I did for 6 items there. Hmmmmmmmmm??Of course the food is not nearly as good as the NY food.   I guess this is probably one of the better delis in town if you can not make it to Cassellas in Scottsdale or NY Hero in Downtown Phoenix.

I love to hate this place. Quandry--- lol  Update- ****Myan Coffee is super Yummy!  ****English Muffins- Heaven as usual but expensive! 9 bucks but worth every bite.  *Sweet treats are good, not the best I have ever had, but darn good.  *Pizza is pretty good for Non NY style, Artisan pizza.   *Parking is still a pain but the Parking Gods were with me tonight. lol  * Service- Hit or miss for sure. Some people fawn all over you and a few are snobby. The nice ones win out ignore the hipster snobs. lol --One girl who works here is just super rude. I wish I got her name. However, three other servers were outstanding. It is what it is. The Pizza manager is very nice. Maybe Josh????   * This is such a great little concept of a store/restaurant. It is always very crowded though, a little pricey, and not easy to maneuver inside the grocery part thus my opening line. But the food is good. I hear their breakfast rocks it. ( I have never had it yet)

"Tongue in Cheek" review to follow.   What a dive bar but oh so much fun. I loved the bar tender. "Aloha"  Barender Gal moving to Hawaii. ( take me with you) You put up with two loud birthday gals and a large bunch of drunk woman walking into your very small, neighborhood bar at midnight. Every head turned when we walked in. It is a pretty small place. teehee! (Just an FYI, not all of us were drunk, but maybe we were, Hmmmmmmmmm??? Insert pinkie to the side of the mouth style)   Just kidding. We had a blast and the place is such a typical neighborhood Divey Bar. Check it out. Not sure the prices since the man next to us was buying all the drinks and I was the DD.

Lovely grounds, lovely service, lovely wedding. Small hidden Gem right in Phx behind the PV mall. I have lived here for over 30 years and had no idea such a nice place was located around there. The hotel is right on a pretty golf course. The grounds are delightful. The rooms are large and clean. I hear the honeymoon suite is gorgeous! The pics looked beautiful. The food was very good for a catered event. Great job ES!

If you are active or family of the military check out the new USO suite in Terminal 4. Also, I was most impressed with the ,"Lost and Found" service I received last week. They literally got back to me in less than an hour. Nice job Sky Harbor! I can't wait until the Sky Train opens too.

I have been a customer for 20 years now.  I moved from the east valley years ago and really miss the food. I do know they have had new owners in the last ten years or so and had heard it wasn't the same. I was happy to revisit Buonos last month before an author visit at Changing Hands. Still great! One of the best NY pizza places in town. YUM! If you like that oil on top, greasy NY slice type of pizza then Buonos is for you. Manga!

Love it. Owners are from West Babylon, NY. They had a pizza shop and Italian bakery in Islip Terrace NY right down the street from where I grew up. I could not believe they lived here for so long and I was unaware. Garlic Knots are great and the pizza is good NY style. The family were all in tonight and visited our table when they heard we were from East Islip. Uncle Joe is such a nice man. The entire evening was just delightful. I am happy to discover this little gem of a place and I will be back. Happy to say they opened a Beall's outlet right next door too so I can shop and eat. Well, at least until they move to their new location.

yes I agree! Fellow NY-er here says this restaurant has some of the best NY pizza in town! They also catered my brother's rehearsal dinner and all the food was great. ( sausage and peppers- yummy!)  Update-6/25/11 - Walked in last night to catch Steve Benson spinning the CD's and drawing caricatures-hello? Not missing that gig. Me- "Wow you remodeled the place"  LIz- the wonderful, superstar waitress- "Yeah, nine years ago" -hahahaahahah! PWEEWWT!!!! I guess I have been eating mostly take out or catering from them over the last few years. LOL! The place looks beautiful and the food is outstanding. The owner is from Smithtown, NY and I love her and this place. Manga!  PS- Hello did I mention Steve Benson was there?- Again did I mention Steve Benson does first Friday's there? You can get a caricature done by none other than Steve Benson. Oops, I'm sorry did I mention Steve Benson is there once a month on Fridays Dj'-ing and drawing -(D and D-lol)  Being politically motivated/involved and an executive member of AEA I was in heaven! I love my teacher caricature! Check it out. Fun times!

The restaurant was busy on a Thursday night which makes my heart happy. I love to see businesses thriving in AZ.  The service was fantastic. I was only in tonight for dessert and coffee. However,  I have eaten at CF many times and have never had a bad meal. They have great pasta dishes and a yummy Aloha themed salad. Today I had a piece of their Coconut and chocolate flavored cheesecake. It was of course yummy. Thank you Jodi for your wonderful service.

I gave up on Chompies over ten years ago and now I know why. Came by today while waiting for X-rays nearby. Good news, they have Knishes. YUMMY! Kinishes are Delish and hard to find in Arizona. Bad news, it was frozen in the center. Sigh!  The place is super cute with the NY murals and all, the menu has a large selection. However, I just do not think the food is very good and horribly overpriced.  Service was terrible as usual. Who brings a bill without once checking on your customer or asking if they need or want anything else? I had to ask two other servers for drink refills. Meh!

We have a joke that when I die and go to heaven St. Peter will meet me at the pearly gates with a Cassella's Chicken Salad Sandwich. My friend even knows how to get free babysitting out of me. YUP- JUST GIVE ME THE SUB ALREADY!!!!!!Hands down the best deli out of NY or Chicago to be found in Phoenix. Small neighborhood place. Their Chicken Salad is the best!!!! Beyond the best!!!!  I wish I knew how they made it. Come on guys fess up will ya?????? I have tried chicken salad in tons of different places and this is the best. For those of you lucky enough to live near Granite Reef and McDonald you are so lucky!!!!!!!!I would eat here every day and be so heavy, but happy, that's for sure!I hear their other sandwiches rock too but I always just get the chicken salad because I am addicted to it and the drive is so far for me to not indulge my addiction. They also have a great vegetable cold cucumber health salad that is very tasty!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I really liked it. I had the Veggie Curry lunch special which was a super deal! The food is great and the prices are so cheap. Lunch special for $5.95, Wow! The server was so delightful. I'll be back. I can't believe I left without ordering my fav kind of coconut ice cream though. Oh well. That just means I have to go back. Warning- I like spicy and the Medium is very hot! Almost too hot so make sure you have an iron gut or are a spicy superstar if you are going to go hot. I believe part of the day was the lovely company. Great company plus good food makes my first New Year Yelp review Yelp-errific!

Once upon a time this used to be the place to go before good coffee and bagel shops opened in Phx. I used to love their coffee 15 years ago but it seems mediocre these days. I have been to this location several times since I move into the neighborhood several months ago.   The coffee was cold or lukewarm each time and the food is microwaved and mediocre. I can't say anything horrible about it but it is not great either. For the price you can get breakfast better elsewhere but it will do if you are in a rush.  Not sure why the food and coffee are never hot enough. The service seems great. The staff here are very friendly. Add a star for service if you want. The bagels are not that great either. However, I do have to say in my opinion, none are in Arizona.   The store is too small. It is not big enough to accommodate their customers. It is a bit stressful eating here. The tables are too few and too close together. You can not even walk by a table with a purse on your shoulder without bumping into someone or begging that a cup of coffee does not end up in your lap.   Also, why is a Starbucks right next door? Knock out a wall and let one of them absorb the other.

My friend could not stop raving about how well they took care of her very sick son who had a blister become seriously infected. Since I have moved into this neighborhood it was the closest for me to get to when I became very sick this week.   I had the misfortune of coming on a day that broke their ER record for most folks in ER. It was crazy, the war of the germs is winning for sure. Every hospital has a wait. That is how it is. For a record breaking day I thought the wait was not bad at all. They treated me right away for what could have been emergency issues. Within ten minutes of me walking in they had me being tested and triage. I did have a long wait for the observation room bed but was put into an ER room within two hours, which is very fast for any valley ER.   I know the system since my previous career was in health care. If you go to an emergency room emergencies are always first and others have to wait. The ER is overused as a Dr's office these days so wait times are very long. Also, a lot of uninsured and unethical people go to the ER to avoid paying. Az has an over 60 percent childhood poverty rate so I can see why the ER was packed with kids. Yes, I had to wait on things while I was there but Nurses are very busy and short staffed. Critical comes first. This is why I avoid ER's like the plague unless it is truly an emergency.   Despite other reviews I met not one rude person at all and I came in contact with at least 40 people while I was here. Everyone here treated me so wonderfully. I was admitted onto the observation floor for a day and a half. In fact I was so impressed with the kind care I received I am going to sit down and write a letter to the people and facility who took such great care of me. A special shout out to Bobbie, DJ, Tina and Michelle, Dr Banner and others who all work in Observation Tower 3. Thank you for helping me feel better.

This is a cute little find of a deli in my hood. They sell Boars Head to go, have a small Treatie display case, and sell bagels. I got  a chicken salad sandwich on rye, which was actually very good. I do not like bagel sandwiches so I went with the breaded option but I did get a salted bagel to take home. It is hard to find salted bagels here in AZ.   The bagel was better than most places in town but not as good as in NY and needed way more salt. I was happy to see they have NY style crumb cake too. I have not seen that out of an Entenmann's box in eons. The woman behind the counter said they ship it in from NY. It is not made fresh daily but it was still pretty good and one of the best I have had out here.   I have to admit it is a bit stressful eating here though. It is way too small and crowded.  You will probably have to share a table if you eat inside. I had to share a table with Docs in training from the university across the street. Although, now that you mention it, I am not sure that is a bad thing. Ha!  The young lady behind the counter was a gem. I  would definitely come back here now that my Favorite NY deli has closed in DT Phoenix.

Once upon a time there was a privately owned local restaurant called the Elephant Bar at Christown Mall. It was a 6 star, superb restaurant and closed maybe in the 90's. This is not that same one. Very Corporate Disneyfied jungle themed restaurant now. I am guessing since it is a chain it is not related to the original. When they sprung up a few years ago I wondered what happened to the old one and if there is any connection to these newer ones. The woman in the restaurant today could not tell me.   With that said, Wow, the reviews on here really surprised me. I ate lunch here today and have eaten at the Chandler location twice before. Today's lunch was great. Our server was a Gem (Brian maybe?) and the food was fine. I never pretend that eating out is all that healthy anyway so I assume it is not when I go out. I am not sure why a lot of Yelpers noted how bad it was for you since it did not seem any worse then any other Chain fusion chain restaurant I have ever eaten at.   I ate the Macadamia Nut chicken lunch special. It was good. Not great, but not terrible either. Instead of my three stars for good, I am giving it four stars because the service was spectacular, the company divine, and the restaurant is beautiful. Okay, maybe a tad cheesy, but I like the entire safari themed furniture and decor.

I am always telling my friends at work that this place is my Disneyland. A drama teacher's best friend. Easley's is a huge 2 room store filled with props, costumes and party favors. I am there. I would move into the place if I could. lol!  I have to be very careful when I go to Easleys because I could spend my entire paycheck there.  I only give it four stars for a few negatives. ( Sadly, however these negatives still don't keep me away but are probably par for any business in this type of field) Some of their costumes, mostly the packaged ones or the ones on the rack in the rental costume room, can be made very, very cheaply, be ripped, and are ridiculously expensive for what you get. If you shop at Savers or Goodwill you can often find formal gowns that can be used as costume starters for less than 20 bucks and the you can add Easleys props, hats gloves etc. Those gown are a way better deal, last longer, and are excellent quality. For me though, and I assume true for others, the convenience of one stop shopping is is the allure. ( And please do not take that comment to mean all of their items are like that. Just be careful and double check what you buy because they have a no refund policy. I tried a dress on today that had rips all over it and one time I bought a hat that was missing a part. Just double check your stuff OK?) The other negative is that yes, they are expensive, and there hours just don't work well for me. More positives: The costumer service is great, the staff are outstanding, friendly and fun, and they rent mascot or more expensive type holiday character costumes. I also especially love the fun room. Here they have tons of wigs, accessories and cheaper types of costumes that you can put together by buying in separate pieces.  When I go To Easley's I usually spend three hours in the store browsing. I love it so much. Happy dress up folks!

A visual feast for the senses. Make sure to catch a show here soon. One of the few older, unique buildings left here.  Phoenix usually loves to tear down their historic sites and I am so glad they have not. On with the show!

How in the world have I missed this place? This place transplanted me right back to my NY roots. I can just see this place in Queens right up to the timely, wrought iron enclosed small patio area that opens up into a shady parking lot. Hahahaha! The previous reviews were right about the parking oddities, to say the least. No parking  lines and you are not sure where you should park since it is not a flat area. I went to the restaurant earlier and I recommend you should too. They say they open at 11am but I got served at 10:30.  I got a half meatball sub, potato salad and a pickle. It was one of the best Meatball subs I have had in AZ. I know granted that is not saying much but the sub was really good! However, what is really wonderful here is the bread. Delish! They make their own. AZ is sorely lacking in the bread dept and it is one of the best sub rolls I have ever had. I will have to go back and try something else.

I love BF. They have the best burger deal in town. Burger, Fries and Drink super cheap. Their burgers and fries are one of the best in Phx! What is really wonderful too and extremely, outstandlishly ( Is that a word?) delicious here is their Breakfast Burro. Who knew? Huge, cheap, tasty-YUMMY!  It is actually one of the best ones I have ever had. They use real sausage too. Check it out.The place is a dive though but you know what they say about divey places having good food.  If you go through drive in be careful it has a strange scary curve. They say a lot of accidents happen in their drive through so no drunk or hung over food runs, OK?

While I am not the biggest Mexican food fan on the block I have always enjoyed eating here. They have this whole Greek/Mexican marriage thing going on-lol. What I really like are the chips and salsa. Interestingly enough their Veggie Burro is kicking!

Pinos restaurant is outstanding! I have only been there twice,  once to sit and  twice to get  take out dessert on my brithday, The second time the owner was kind enough to talk to me a long time about italy, his family, food etc. I always find that scores big points with me when the owner mingles with guests. The pizza is right up there with the few best places in Phx if you like Ny pizza( oil on top and all) I had a salad too. It came with fochaccia which I did not think was great,  but I  like the Garlic or Rosemary kind, so freepass there. TIRIMUSO- I have had it all over the world, since sadly I am addicted to the stuff, and this is one of the top two I have had. EXCELLENT! If I weren't in public I would have licked the plate clean.TEEHEEE- On my birthday I did lick the stryofoam container clean since I was in the privacy of my own home-teehee! The service is good here too.I went early so missed the crowd. ( Like 5pm on a weekday)  The man from France helped me on both occassions and he is very nice. It cracks me up, strikes me funny, that an Italian restaurant has a french waiter, I like that! Keep up the great job people of Pinos. YUMMY!

Well, it's in a bad part of town so it's rude visitors tend to ruin it. Like another person said I too try to go to the AMC at Esplanade or Az Center instead. Every time I go to Christown I get my movie ruined by fellow audience members who are; Texting, talking on the phone, bringing babies, starting trouble, and talking loud through the entire movie. I stopped going to the movie over these issues even. Movies are too expensive to miss half of it due to out of control movie patrons. The theater itself is nice and all, typical Harkins. Plenty of parking. They do need line control barriers at the box office though. I have seen fights start here over short cutting.  I am giving today 4 stars though. Today they did something that really impressed me and I think that all theaters should do it as well. If they did I would start going to the movies more often. I would even add that they should monitor throughout the movie like they do at concerts and plays.   They had an usher actually sitting people in seats, filling in empty seats along the way. (kind of like an usher at the theater or symphony)  Now, I am sure it was because they expected the show to sell out but I still thought it was a great idea. I was pretty amazed by that and what followed. Right before the movie started a woman introduced herself as the theater manager. She then went over house rules. She asked that we please abide by the no texting, no rowdy kids, etc and so forth regarding interruptions. She even told us all to put our phones away right then and there. "Woot, Woot!" The manager then discussed a little background on the movie and ended with a hope that we all enjoy the show. I have never seen anyone do this at a non preview premier or a filmed movie before. I was very impressed. Of course people still broke the rules but what do you do? Monitor throughout might help but you can't control other people's behavior. For such a packed house it was better than usual though. On a side note why do people bring babies to movies anyway? It's dangerous to their brain development.

The food is good here. The pita bread and Feta cheese are the best in town. Parking and entering the lot is a bit tricky at times, especially around rush hour. The funny thing is they have some of the best french fries in town. Who knew? All the food is tasty though. They have Gyros, Pizza, a great Chicken Picada Salad-yum. (And BTW, their house dressing is to die for!)  The place itself is kind of divey and small but the food is not. Enjoy!

If I could give this location zero stars I would. I am surprised this place is not shut down by food inspectors or McDonalds corp offices.  This is a horrific McDonalds. The food is always bad, cold, cooked, or served wrong, despite the easy order. ( Ice in a drink. REALLY? Ya can't even get that right McDonalds staff worker? )  The equipment is always broken, place is dirty except the parking lot ( More on that in a minute)  the staff do not speak English but work positions where they need to, and never  get the order or change correct.     I had complained several times about the staff member who goes out and waters the parking lot every day. McDonalds corporate offices ( not in the deserts of Az of course)  tell me it is policy to wash the parking lots fully every day. REALLY? Even when it is clean? Really? The whole parking lot in a huge strip mall McDonalds? REALLY? Even when you have 200 cars backed up at drive through? Is this the workers only job? He sits out there on the curb holding a hose. He does not clean the restaurant or the bathroom or help serve the million people backed up on line? Hey I want that job. ( insert sarcasm here) Hey MIKEYD"S you do know we live in the desert right?     I used to go here every morning on the way to work for my cafe fix but I stopped last week. I will never go back. Last week the man with the hose was outsIde smoking!( yes a cig, it was lit, and yes he did inhale!)  He was also just aiming the hose in the air letting the water squirt into the air. No, thank you for asking, there were no trees, flowers or plants nearby, just cement. Not a clue what he was doing. Just wasting water in the desert and smoking. SMOKING???????Did I mention he was smoking? EWHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH Oh BTW, did I mention he was smoking????? Smoking around food? Ok, technically there was no food in the parking lot but ya get my drift right? I say OMG! How gross are you McDonalds?

if I hash-tagged, this would be called, "Don't judge a book by it's cover."  Okay, this is one of those stories titled, "What rock have I been hiding under?" I literally have driven by this place every day for 15 years on the way to work and never knew it existed. Okay, well I did see the pizza sign but never thought I would ever actually stop. So today rolls around. After an especially stressy week at work I needed some comfort food bad. I was not feeling well so just wanted a place close to home. I just wanted to get some food to eat and stock the leftovers in the fridge for a long projected week ahead of overtime. Sooooooo, I threw my Zip Code into the Yelp finder and this place pops up.   The place itself is a total dive. Very ugly and very rundown as prior Yelpers mentioned. I think there was a drug deal going down at the Circle K next door. Just kidding, but maybe not. lol The place is small inside. I threw my body into a bench like type table that was very uncomfortable. ( Note to self, get a free standing table next time or sit in a chair. Do not sit on the bench.)  A very nice family was sitting across from me with their darling kids.   I wasn't sure what I wanted since the reviews said their subs were great too. I  browsed the menu with that in mind. I decided to order a small pizza with sausage, and an Italian hero to go. I also ordered some Cannolli.  They brought me the Cannolli first. "Hmmmmmmm, Dessert first? I advocate that. "Those guys are not making it home", I say to myself or maybe even out loud. So, I promptly inhale the two bite size treats only after letting them sit long enough to snap a photo. Gotta make the friends jealous, right? Also, I want to let Bill know I do inhale every now and again. Next up, the foil wrapped hero and my jaw promptly hits the floor. Are you kidding me? It was huge. See picture. Wow!  The pizza came last. It was all very good. I was pleasantly surprised how this place has been here for 30 years and not one of my NewYorkies have told me about it.   What is also great are the prices. My bill was 20 dollars and literally four people could have eaten off of the tremendous sandwich and small pizza. They also deliver any menu item for a two dollar fee.   I will be happy munching all week during Parent- Teacher conferences.

I know it is  Denny's but still. Come on Denny you have competition for good cheap breakfasts nowadays. You used to have a reasonable priced, okay breakfast. What happened? I ate here on 6/4/13 and the coffee was cold, the eggs were ice cold and runny, the English Muffin was raw, not toasted at all and the fruit was actually spoiled. (brown bananas and sour, pruny, moldy grapes, WTH?) The bill was 10 dollars and change. OH MY! The server was nice but overworked. This is not the first time this location has had problems. We used to go here for our welcome back breakfast at school. It was bad. One time it took 1 hour to get my food and I got sick later on. YIKES.

I have been to this place several times and each time it is either disappointing or downright awful! I am not sure what the big deal is about this place. There are so many great steak places in town and the food here is not good. Okay, the rolls are good,not great, but still, are ya gonna go to a crappy place just for the rolls?   We went again last week for a friends party. I will never step foot in this restaurant ever again after the way we were treated. We are all ex-servers and know how to treat customers. We were all horrified how rude the staff was to us. We should have gotten up and walked out to go someplace else.

Very clean store and friendly service. This is a smaller warehouse type of store that you can shop at with no membership card requirement. I go here when I need to buy in bulk for my classroom goodies, staff in-services, school parties, and for my teacher appreciation treaties. I do not have the need to go very often. However, when I can't get a friend who has another "warehouse" membership card to shop for me, I drop by here. They have limited items of course but it is great when I need fifty 100,000 bars. lol

Zero stars and maybe a complaint to the AMA is in order.   I do not know which eye mill is worse Lenscrafter or Nationwide. Do not go to either but please, I beg of you, do not go to NW at 35th Ave and Bethany Home Rd. I had to return three times to get a correct prescription and the doctor was a real jerk. Sorry but he really was! I mean honestly, he blamed me for him giving me the wrong contact RX. Who has time to return three times for their incompetency?   The Ophthalmologist ( If he even was one) really did blame me. I am not exaggerating. His direct quote, "If it wasn't your fault, you did not read the chart wrong and tell me the wrong letters, I would have given you the correct RX."--- OMG!  Run away!

If you like good/great fish do not go here. If you want average AZ type of fish, an, "All You Can Eat" Fish Fry for 12 bucks, and you are not a picky person who knows good food than by all means go here. It is what it is. Kick it to three stars if you have a big appetite and want to eat a lot. lol---  We had dinner here tonight and it was just average. My friend suggested it since she heard raves but then could not figure out why. We had a coupon for a free Clam Chowder. I do not like that so did not get any. My friend said it was not good at all. We both got the fish fry. All we can say is, "Meh."   If you are a big eater then it is probably a good deal. They do give you a lot of food though. The service bothered me. Our server was very nice but she got basic things wrong. I am usually very forgiving of that but it added to our non impressed status of the place. A Diet Coke turned into an Ice Tea and she figured the bill wrong. Also, the bathroom was filfthy. A big," No, No" for me.

Night out with the girls for my birthday. The food was outstanding.  The Cannaloni was superb. I had Chicken Parm with pasta. Hard to find good Gravy in AZ. Not bad here! My friend had Eggplant Parm-great too! The service was outstanding. I loved the Bruschetta Apps. They even gave us a free desert for my birthday. We had a Groupon so dinner for three with wine, apps and dessert was a steal! I can't wait to go back.

Wow, the production of Le Mis was certainly not what I was expecting. I figured they would rewrite a child's version but no they pretty much took it head on. I was duly impressed with the kids in the show, with exception of one. We certainly have some very talented young folks in the valley. I have seen the show several times live and in a movie. Also, a friend was in the Broadway version so I am a Le Mis fiend! I know the score by heart. it's a heavy show with powerful music. Not so child friendly, so if you go with little ones, it might need a conversation before hand or maybe a no go on this one and try the next one  ( Cinderella is their next show)     My only gripe was the Innkeeper. It is one of my favorite theater characters and  live theater funny scenes.  Role of a lifetime. When I saw it on Broadway I was rolling! I was severally disappointed in the character who had this part. I could not hear him at all or understand the words. Luckily I already knew the words to the songs, so knew they were funny, but still. ( speak clearly and louder please, it's an opera after all) It is an awesome character to ham up and I felt he just fell flat.  All of the other characters were loud enough so not sure what was going on there. Microphone issues? Also, he had friends in the audience that were extremely rude and distracting. I still can't complain too much though since the show was great for a kids production. I was like, "WOW, What in the world? They were awesome!     The theater is a sweet little theater building. Older, smaller, plain venue, but charming. A few negatives or "keep in minds when you go advice" Seating and parking are not great here so get there early. People don't seem to understand the walk to the end of the row rule without leaving random seats in between you. Seats are open and non assigned so it is hard to sit everyone together.  We always have problems when we go here with seating. Tonight we had huge parking issues. Note to self get there even earlier next time.  Also at times I wonder if they oversell the shows.     All in all a nice night out. if your kids love theater you should take them. I believe I hear they have birthday parties too. That sounds like tons of fun!!!!!!!

This place rocks. Huge store with just about anything you can think of that screams Az, Az tacky, Az local, or how to impress my back east friends or out of town guests. ( ie- Kick Ass/Az hot sauce, Tombstone hot mustard, cricket lollipops-lol) I like shopping in here. The staff was very nice as well.

Wow, I am very surprised by some of the reviews here. I have eaten here about 6 times now and it has always been fantastic! We even had a large party of over 20 people for a birthday party of very picky, picky eaters and all was great. We have tried various dishes here and they are all delish. Their chicken curry is one of the best in town! ( But spicy so beware) They also have a good Tangerine Beef dish. Sorry can't  comment on the Sushi since I think Sushi is disgusting! The Ice cream is a nice ending to your meal too.  The service is wonderful here!  We are alway treated like family.

This restaurant is great!. Mike, the celebrity look alike -lol, was amazing as our server. I had Chicken Pepper pizza and my fella had the Lobster Ravioli. We`also had Caprese Salad and Tiramusu. All of the food was delicious and the service was tremendous.To let you in on a little secret, I loved the pepper dipping sauce they served with the bread. I had heard about this place and when a Groupon came along I jumped all over it. I was not disappointed at all

Ok bad Mary. I have lived here for almost 30 years and have never been here!!!!WHY??????? But in my defense there were no Yelp sites back then to push me into going by writing a glowing review. All I can say is drop what you are doing now and go. This place is amazing! You do not have to be a big archi lover to enjoy the wonders of this place. (And the view aint half bad either)  If you get the Culture Pass that the Phx Libraries offer you can get the basic tour for free. 4 passes at 26 dollars a pop for free can you believe it? It only costs  a few more dollars to upgrade to the next tour. BARGAIN!!!!!!! You have to go on a tour you just can't go and wander around there since people live here and it is a private school. ( BTW that Culture Pass thing is a gem! I might have to write a separate review for it!) bring tons of water, walking shoes,hats, your camera, and be forewarned it is hot. A lot of the tour is outside or in hotter buildings with little air venting but hey a small price to pay to see this place of a great minded man!  PS- we did bring a small child. Although most people on here say it is not child friendly children may enjoy it if they are interested in art or old buildings.  I must say they would have to be children who have been exposed to longer tours at musuems before so use caution. The tour guides love kids though so if you have an inquisitive little one bring them along. .

There's no business like show business. As any of my friends will tell you I am a theater junkie. I could sit in a theater all day, all week, all year long and do nothing but gaze at live performances of theatrical talent. lol! Well in actuality, hmmmmmmm I really could. I am not even joking on that. I probably would if someone brought me water every now and again. LOL!  Ok, seriously now, Childsplay is my favorite organization in Az for a host of reasons.     My dear friends of Childsplay know who they are. This is children's theater at it's best! The Q and A sessions after each show is a plus. The kids love it. I have to admit I do too since I get to go say hi to my friends after each stage-show. I also learn more techniques that I can steal when I teach drama to my inner city students. Teehee!  ( Yes I am a teacher and yes I would die to have some of their costumes and sets)     I have seen so many wonderful plays, literature remakes, and original scripts performed At TCPA and by Childsplay. Fernidad, BFG and New Kid were only some of the most amazing masterpieces I have had the distinct pleasure of viewing from these talented actors. Debbie, Scott, Katie, Jodi; well all of them! LOVE YOU!    Childsplay also has an artist in Residence program for schools. We have had an artist at our school for several years. It is wonderful to note that the teaching techniques classroom teachers are learning are helping tomorrows future. Time after time I have seen struggling kids blossom under their tutelage.      Of importance to note, TCPA is a beautiful facility. You can enjoy a nice venue along with the superstar talent. What more can you ask for?      The only negative I can possibly imagine is that in today's hard times the cost may be inhibiting to some families. But if you like them on Facebook they sometimes have discounted tickets and contests to win free tickets. A great way to start viewing them and get involved.     I do hope everyone continues to support the arts here in Az. As I have stated in my other "ARTS" reviews, I do worry about cultural program survival in Az with recent state budget cuts. Soooooooo, as a famous circus/rodeo person once said, "Go, On With The Show".

I minored in musical theater and grew up in NY so I am a theater snob and very spoiled when it comes to musicals and plays. However, I  can be down to earth too. I am a drama teacher and could spend every minute of every day seeing a show or even sitting in a dark theater. With that said, I feel like Gammage is the star of that show about the long past her prime, almost dead silent screen star Blanche Dubois. Beautiful to look at, a great history, a glorious architecture who built her up from love, but way past her prime. ( OHHH a grave is rolling over. So sorry Frank LLoyd)    I love the shows here but not the venue. I am so sorry Mr. Wright but your building needs an upgrade. When I was a dancer at ASU I loved it! So cool, Wedding cake shaped design, and a famous building right across from my dorm that I actually performed at. I felt so special! I really do still do love you GG but something must be done. The theater I believe sits 3,000 people and you have bathrooms for like 15 people. The last time we went here my pregnant friend could not even get into the bathroom. They also allow people in late, which is a big theater no no. I went to see Phantom last night and not only did they let like 25 people in late, which ruined my first act of the show, but my chair was broke. For the price of the ticket it should not only not have been broken but gold plated- Lol.   The sound has issues here if you are not dead center. I know it is hard to renovate a classic building but port a potties could be a solution too.Something must be done and I know you know it is a problem Gammage people. Anyone listening. People have been telling you for years. Anyone listening, hello ??????? Come on fix the problem. Frank wouldn't mind.

I have been here about four times and only for lunch. All four times I have sat on the patio, had no important deadlines to be after, and had outstanding food and service. I had no problems with parking but the times we went could be considered odd or off hours. Other reviewers have documented that they had parking issues. We just parked right across the street. If we were not suppose to park there, "could have fooled me." I never saw a sign that said, "ASU Parking Only, Subject To Towing." One time we just walked in from Mill. I guess we got lucky.    The outside patio is so, so quaint, and the food is delish! The prices are not cheap and I heard even more for dinner, and the service is slower. It reminds me of a "Ladies Who Lunch" or,  "Do Tea" place. I actually like the slower service pace. I go there only when that is okay for me. It can be very busy here since it is a smaller restaurant so be prepared.     The last time I went I had a fruit tea, they throw in real fruit, love it! I ordered the Grilled Chicken Sandwich with Capricho de Cabra Goat Cheese, Fig Jam, Bacon and Arugulaon Toasted Ciabatta. Served with Fresh Fruit &Greens with Rosemary -Balsamic Vinaigrette. The sandwich was good and the salad that came with it was wonderful, as well. My lunch friend said the food was spectacular! I think she got the Ahi Tuna or maybe the Salmon.

Yummy chicken salad sandwich. The bread was really quite good. I do not usually like apricots but i enjoyed the bread that had baked into it; apples, walnuts and apricots. The servers were very nice.The restaurant is very small and in an old building in the historic area of Glendale. I adore old restored houses/cottages. The only negative is the place is a bit pricey for lunch. Maybe it is a better place to go for dinner? 19 dollars seemed a bit much for a sandwich lunch and a drink. I do want to go back and try the Perogies though.

The food was horrendous and I rarely say that about a place. The potatoes were cold and undercooked and the sausage patty was like eating rubber and burnt on top. I got sick after eating here. On the positive side The cafe is cute and the servers were beyond fantastic. A little hard to find the place. Maybe it was just an off day for them? I will try again for lunch and update my review.

Lux has come a long way from the tiny coffee shop it once was. The new place is really fun with a cool vibe but beware of the packed factor. It is pretty ridiculous making me hesitate to go back. There is always a line out the door, parking issues, and nowhere to sit. If you can snag a seat it is on a couch or hanging off a bar stool so rather hard to eat and awfully uncomfy.   Today, I ordered the Dutch Pancake. I did not like the burnt top part of the pancake. My friend says the last time she ordered it it was not burnt like that and tasted better. The unburnt part was Delish though but at 10 bucks it should be perfect! You can get it with fruit or veggies. My friend got the biscuits and gravy which I loved. Not too heavy or salty with a hint of Sage.   Pros- Good food, fun vibe, cool decor, music, friendly folks, best coffee drinks in town I dare to say.   Cons, Wowza this place is expensive, packed to the gills every time I have come, and Panne Bianco is right next door causing an eating choice dilemma -lol   I am sure there must be an off time here to go to avoid the crowds. if you know what that time is let me know. Also, I can always solve one of the dilemmas by eating here and getting Panne to go when the weather cools off. Granted, this could only happen if the second mortgage for food cost that day comes through, ha!   ;)

Forgot how great this place is. We used to go here all the time back in our glory days of the 80's. Best wings in town. We had the pepper chicken sandwich and a Flat bread app tonight. Delish. Beware the sandwich is spicy though. A Coconut Martini and Cheese Cake actually shipped in from Ny topped off the meal. The service was spectacular all around. On a side note, I forgot how funny their bathrooms are. Ha!

The first time someone told me about this place like twenty years ago I was like, "Ewhhhhhhhhh, Really? Mixed Chinese and Mexican food? GROSS!" However,  it works and many menu food items are very good. I am not a fan of Mexican food in general but I like most of the food here. The Jade chicken Quesadilla is my favorite.  I know this is random but they have the best Black Beans in Az. In fact I have a friend who says they are the best in America. She has tried them all over the world and always thinks theirs are the best. She has to have them every so often. Random number two, who knew? Their Snickerdoodles are the best I have found out of NY or a bakery. I know, very random.

I have been eating here for several years and have sent tons of people to eat here.So far none have ever had a bad experience. ( it is a super modern restaurant ) Now I wish I could say all the food is great, I am sure it is but I always get the same thing when I go here.Sigh I know I need to branch out more but I just love the burgers here and have to have one every time I go.They also have these Harriss fries that are to die for. They come with  a lemony type of white sauce and are soooooooooo good! However, all my friends say the other dishes are yummy too. One friend likes the brunch here. Check it out.  PS- the first time we went here the owner pulled up a chair for a chat. Gotta love that!

Okay, first I must say how unacceptable it is that I have never been here in my 30 plus years living in Phoenix. My BBF lives right down the street and I have passed by the darn place for years. Was so mad I missed the reinvention of "Vics" when it was open here for a bit. I cried when I heard it closed. Well it was nice to finally visit and eat here beyond the Grilled Cheese and Mac and Cheese throw down of course. (They beat my friend's husband but I won't hold that against them. My friend thinks I should though--JK --;o)-- not really, but sort of. lol)  Well this place has a lot of cheese and fish on the menu so I had a hard time deciding what to eat since I am not a fan of either. I so wanted to try their specialty burger but I despise Blue Cheese. A big sigh, since it sounded so great, all other ingredients considered.  I finally decided on the Kale salad with chicken and a side of fries. It was pretty good.  The bread they serve is yummy too. I loved their fries. The sauce they serve with it is Delish!  We went here last night with my NY club and to celebrate a wedding that took place over the summer. I can not speak more highly of the delightful waitress. Sorry I did not get her name but she is an ASU student who has a father that is a professor. Gooooo Sun Devils!  I want to thank her for her kindness. ( she knows why)   All the staff that I ran into were superb and friendly. The bar staffers were efficient and helpful, ( Mytry-lol) even the front desk folks gave us a big wave as we exited the place. The Valet said not one word about my messy car so that deserves a shout out in itself. In all that rain I felt a tad bad for them last night.   I love the retro feel of the lobby and patio area. I can just imagine Frank and Marilyn walking outside.  The restaurant is a bit on the pricey side for those watching pennies but pretty equivalent to the other places to eat in Scottsdale. In conclusion, I would like to go back again and perhaps book a Staycation.

I am writing this review in regards to the Culture Pass they offer.   The Culture Pass is better than sliced bread and I hope they continue to do it. You go to the library, show your library card, and tell them what museum you want to go to. (There are 11 choices to include the Science Center, The Phx Zoo and Tallisean West, just to name a few) If they have the pass available(Go early on Monday for best selections)  for that particular museum they will give you a piece of paper that is worth 4( yes you heard me right, 4 free admissions!!!) this is amazing! We have used it so far and have saved over 150 dollars and have only used it twice.Can't wait to use it some more!  PS- be flexible. I went to a museum I  never thought I would go to because that is all they had left and it was great. You would be surprised what fun there is out there waiting to be discovered!

A delightful, delicious, darling place to go. The house is historic in downtown Glendale. Very pretty with twinkle lights on the outside. I love old buildings. I had the curry and it was delicious. Service was good too. Everyone tells me this is the place to go to get Pho. I will have to come back and check that out.

Ya know I am just not a big fan of Bookmans like everyone else seems to be. I guess I get so many teacher discounts that Bookmans is nothing to talk about in that area.  I should love this place being the literacy queen that I am but I find them way to expensive. Examples- I found a game of Jenga here used. Box ripped but in semi OK condition. I am not kidding when I say the game cost more than a brand new one at Target. Also, they had a library book there that I am sure someone stole and they were charging 50 cents less than what Borders was charging retail with no discount. Now granted it is the best browsing store around  but the deals here are not great unless you have a trade in slip, or gift card. It is especially not a great  discount for educators. Lots of hoop jumping for 20 percent or so off and it still is more than Gardeners, Borders, Barnes and Noble, and Scholastic and their stuff is brand new.  Even with the discount things will cost you way to much for used items.Also, last week i went in and was treated rudely  by a trading staff member. They also rip you off in trade and cash. i know they are making a fortune on the things they take in.And they actually take in very little for the most part so don't get your hopes up that they will buy your stuff.  But I guess if you are broke and need 5 dollars they might buy a book or DVD from you but I guarantee they will resell if for 50 bucks or so. lol!

I went in today 10/18/10 to sell some CDs for my landlord that a renter left behind. I was treated very well. ( Much better than the last time I was in)  I also received an email in regards to my prior review from the store manager last week. That is very impressive. I still think they are expensive on some items but I understand they are a private owned, non chain store. However, I am very happy to see the manager try to retain me as a customer.I was impressed when she tried to offer me a free coupon for a future visit, which was totally unnecessary but very classy! I love great customer service! It really makes a difference to me. I was thrilled to see the Dexter books on the "Hot item" shelf. I couldn't believe it!  They were both on my reading list and a long wait at the library.  So I bought them. they were a bit pricey for used but in great shape so the deal was good.

Wow, so surprised by the other reviews. Went last night, finally! One of the best dining experiences of my life. OUTSTANDING SERVICE! Hi Patti.The food was wonderful. Mango, Tomato, Gazpacho, Chicken and Palenta YUMMY!!!!!!! They did say they just changed their menu a few months ago. ( I am still dreaming about those cheesecake Taquitos and dipping sauces.SIGH) I do agree with the other reviews that the place is shockingly expensive.  You need to save up your pennies. The view is heaven! And the turning part.???? Well it revolves. YES it does. It is what the place is famous for. I never got sick from a revolving restaurant before so not sure about the bad review about that feature  but I guess seasick easily people might want to skip it here and heed the other reviewers warnings. No 5 stars though because I can't afford to eat here on a teachers budget. It probably is a once in a lifetime, or very long in between times, experience for me.

You betcha previous reviewers! Oh so good!Oh so weird!Oh so politically  incorrect name and Panda Bear decor, But that's half the fun!  The black beans are great. They have the best snickerdoodles I ever had out of a bakery. Beware your stomach may get upset, if it tends to be sensitive. The food can be a bit greasy depending on what you order.

Great little place in Arcadia with a cute patio and good Breakfast and Lunch choices. To be honest I have not had any breakfast choices yet but I have eaten here four or five times for lunch. The food is always good, the treaties are yummy, and the workers are nice even when they are grumpy. lol----   The only negative is that it is always packed so there is a wait. Go here to relax and slow down not if you are in a rush.

I feel compelled to update and add a third review.  Although this place has good food and I have gone four or five times now I am very upset over how rude we were treated today on 9/12/13. The woman who works the counter is always a bit off and snappy but today she was actually very ugly to my friend and I did not appreciate it.   Sadly it was my friends first time visiting. What a horrid first impression. My friend is so sweet she felt the need to apologize profusely only for asking questions about the menu and food allergies. I told my friend that she had no right to apologize since it was the woman's fault not hers.   The woman who works behind the counter does this type of thing all the time but today she was extra special nasty. I hate to tell her but you never know who your customers are so you should respect all. ( if she only knew-lol) The weird thing is that all the other workers in this restaurant are extra delightful and excellent. I guess they make up for Ms Grumpy and Overwhelmed. I understand having a bad day and am usually very forgiving of that having worked in many restaurants myself. However, you should never sigh, bang the counter, yell and scream, continue to shout, "15 minutes to closing time" and complain about how dirty your customers are within earshot of them. Also, rolling your eyes at a costumer for only asking about your Delish food is usually frowned upon in good costumer service manuals.   This worker is the odd ball for sure. ( Lordy is she the owner? That would be funny. Funny sad, not funny, haha) I don't believe I will come back unless this is corrected. This is not NYC's Seinfield's Soup Kitchen.

My favorite Indie, local place EVA!!!!!!!! You never know what you are going to find in here. Well, except for books of course. Okay, where else can one get a little purse with a vintage picture of a TWA plane on it? Random I know, but my Dad worked for TWA for 45 years. Score!   They have the best speakers, guest authors, and classes too. I can't wait until Nov 1 when their Phoenix location opens because their current location is just too darn far away.   The only bad I guess was that today the service was not as friendly as usual. Still, not enough to knock out the 5 star rating but they should and need to watch this. (Especially after reading the poor customer review from the girl who came in near closing time)

I must be the only person in Phx never to eat here. Ok, so we did finally go before Phantom. Mixed reviews here.I love Peiwei so assumed I would love this place too.I did not.  I am at a crossroad as to give it a good review or a bad so I  will just say what happened noting what I liked an disliked about the experience.  We got here at around 4:45 which was good because by the time we left the place had a long wait and was packed. The first thing I did not like is the way it is set up. Tables all over the place with no spaces to walk in between. It was very odd. I found this very annoying and I am sure a nightmare for older or handicapped people. It seemed very weird for me to be banging into people's elbows as I walked by their tables. The service was very good at the start but died when they got busy. Although the manager here was great, printing out nutritional value menu for me and another waitress walked me to the bathroom. Our server was ok, seemed a little ditzy but was ok, not great just, OK. I ordered a wedge salad with chicken and got a wedge salad with no chicken. I ate it all before I realized it. (I know don't ask. I guess I was starving and the blood drained from my brain) I did not want the waitress to think I was trying to scam her. I pointed it out and said it was Ok since I did not point it out sooner and after all I did eat it all but just an FYI for the cook. She did not seem very concerned and I think this is a huge mistake for a place to make. They did not comp the bill the difference which I think they should have even though I said it was ok.( The salad was good but there was a three dollar difference in price) I worked in the restaurant business for years and comping the difference would  have been the very  least I would have done. I also thought that was a huge mistake on the part of the cook and server in an expensive place such as this. . Of course, I do take partial responsibility for not noticing it until it was to late and the food was good. The dressings make it. I had these awesome cucumbers too that tasted nice.  Again, it is their sauce. My friend had a noodle dish that was very tasty too. The service took along time to get the food to us though and the place was horribly noisy. Yikes! Two large parties sandwiched around us. One where children kept clinking knives on the glasses non stop and the other table had people clapping every minute about something or another. This was horrid! I like a quieter dining experience please.The last straw was when a couple with 2 very naughty kids sat down in back of us and I got wacked in the back of the head with the kid's paper that he kept flinging around and hitting his father with.A father that did not do one thing to discipline the kid.  Please if you are bringing out the kids leave if they are misbehaving. All in all the experience was not horrible but not great either. I might go back for lunch and try some more of their dishes. However, to be honest there are other good restaurants in town that are better suited to me. Since I love Peiwei i will eat there more often and skip this much pricier option.

What a fun place. I loved the vibe, music, and food. I am not usually a fan of German food but I enjoyed my Original Brat meal. The potatoes are awesome! My server was fine but he really lacked personality. The gal on the way out made up for it. She talked to me about the history of the restaurant and was most gracious! I have to say, and my friends will laugh at this comment, I enjoyed the Accordion player. He is quite good!

How strange to read the bad reviews. I am picky and thought my sandwich was delish and wonderful. The service was excellent. One of the owners was there and he was delightful to talk too. Hmmmmm, not sure how it stacks up to an authentic steak from Philly since I have never been there to have one but I know who to send to find out. I think Wiz is gross so I had the regular Roast Beef sandwich with provolone, onions and banana peppers and it was great! Their sweet potato fries were good too. They are also open 24/7 which is amazing in itself. Check it out. Maybe the after bar crowd suffers. I don't know but it was fine when we went on Black Friday. It was not busy nor rude. We had a Groupon so even better.

I used to go here years ago when it was a casual cheese steak sandwich shop. They sold the business 6 years ago and redecorated the place to a small intimate Italian restaurant. The food is great. Cheese-steaks here are still delish! Service was good, and I loved the singer accordian player. Until next time- yummy dreams!  PS- They have Gelati here that is good. We had the Hazelnut chocolate one- sigh!

A group of us Yelp Elite's had a really great time at the drag show charity brunch. The food was okay. Nothing great and nothing bad. I would like to go back and try their actual Italian food. I had eaten here over 25 years ago when it was called Roman Table and it looked so completely different. They have been open since the 1950's. This is so cool to me and the second 1950's place coincidentally I have eaten at this weekend. I like that since Phx has a habit of tearing down it's old buildings.   It really was so much fun at the charity brunch. It is something they do every month and donate money to a local charity. This time it was for an adopt the Greyhound cause. Gotta love that. I had never been to a drag show before so it was totally something random, crazy and different. It is a bit naughty so no kids please.  It costs 25 dollars but you do get unlimited Cape Cods or Mimosas with your brunch and the proceeds go to the charity.

Great food, atmosphere. The Calamari and Caprese were delicious! The service was fantastic!  The best part of the evening was the company and the staff was gracious about letting us enjoy our time together.  Memorable evening with fantastic friends and great food. Manga!

I am just not a fan. One time we ordered food for a staff party and many staff members got sick. I have eaten here several times before over the years and before Yelping became standard and once again last week for our, "last day of school eat out tradition."  While I can't say anything bad about the service the food is just not very good. I do have to say the Gaucamole I ordered was really nasty.  I know, I know I am picky about Mexican food but I wanted to eat with my "Peeps." However, I will probably not eat here ever again.   Another thing that keeps going around in my mind is that I worked at a Garcia's when I first graduated college and I was treated very poorly.

Fellow Yelpie Elite Chrissy gifted me with a ticket to join her in the jungle to see Tarzan. Never one to say no to theater and dying to finally see this theater I enthusiastically said yes! Of course I was widely excited to support local, as always. From a local theater to local talent I had a fantastic time sitting in the front row with the gorillas, lizards, spiders, flamingos, and other jungle creatures.   This is a very cute, small theater that puts you right in the heart of the action. It was wonderfully decorated to theme and everyone I met was extremely kind and helpful.   There are a lot of great eateries right at the theater so no need to drive twice. I was widely surprised how built up this area has become and the high caliber restaurants that are home there now. There is even a Pomos that just opened. Wonderful pizza by the way. Parking is a bit tight around here but there is a large lot behind the theater.  I only had two complaints. One is that I live on the other side of town, (insert sad face) and two, they would not allow me under any circumstances to swing the Tarzan rope vine. Sigh, what's up with that? ( Wink)   To conclude, the tickets are pretty economical as far as local packages and seats go. Check it out.

One of the things that frustrates me when I want a night out is that the movie I want to see is never playing at the right time to eat dinner out too. You either have to eat dinner way too early to finish in time and make the show or eat after the show but by then it is midnight. lol     So how to solve the issue, go to a dine in theater. I am mad I did not think of this idea myself. Haha! I had heard a lot about this concept this year but had not had the chance to go to one yet. I finally indulged this past Saturday. I had not been to this location since they remodeled so did not know what to expect except the things I had heard, which were all wonderful.    The concept is a bit different from a regular movie. You purchase your seats with a certain seat number ahead of time, kind of like a play or concert. You can choose between the Dine In Theater or the Lounge. The lounge is three dollars extra and has reclining seats. They advertise the lounge as having " A more adult like feel! "  Ok, don't ask me what that means-hahaha! but My friends say it is great.     When I first walked in I noticed the nice lobby lounge chairs and bar. You can order drinks and food outside like in the old days-;0) that's ok too but the great thing here is that your theater chair is actually like a table at a restaurant. No more long lines at the popcorn counter, wow! (People who are late a lot will love it here! Ya hear that certain friends of mine?-lol- You all can run to your seat, get food delivered, and Wah-La the movie starts. brawhahah- sorry I digress) They give you full service right at your seat and even extend it during the movie. There is a button to call the waitress over when you need something but to be honest I never needed to punch the buttons. The servers were all over us the minute we sat down and the minute we needed anything. Actually, the service here was outstanding which prompted me to write a review! I thought it would be a bit distracting but it really was not.    The food was OK not bad but not OMG I am going to die either. The menu was a lot more innovative then I thought it would be so I would go back to try some other things.I just ordered the bread and pretzel basket with red sauce and spicy cheese dip. It was good but how do you go wrong with that? My friend had a burger that she said was good. The Parm fries were tasty.  The thing I liked best is getting refills given to me at my seat. Yahoooo! The simplest things are the smallest blessings.    OK, have to write the negative. You pay for the convenience. The place is very expensive so bring your wallet. The cheapest movie is 12 bucks and the lounge is 15 and the food is over priced. Wow! Shocking you say. Food overpriced at the movies? I am so surprised! But in this case it is really over priced. Well, like I said before you pay for the convenience, I suppose. Sadly, I won't be able to go here all the time but a nice treat every now and again. I suppose when you factor in gas and travel time between a restaurant and a movie house it might be similar.  Check it out. Definitely worth at least a one time visit to see what you think.

I have taken SS many, many times over the last 20 years and have been very happy with it. I will stick to the Phx area for this review. I have never been late for a flight on the way to the airport, if anything you will get their super early. I'd rather be early then late to the airport anyway. Bring a book.  On the way back I book online and take advantage of a AAA discount. To be honest you can find numerous coupon codes on line if you are adamant about it. The drivers have always been happy, safe, honest and courteous. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that you have to wait at times, a bit at SkyHarbor on the return. For me it is no big deal. I plan that in my trip time since I have no flight to catch. I never book flights back at last minute. However, if you are in a rush or have a place to be then get picked up by a friend or take a taxi and be forewarned. I have caught a shuttle in as little as three minutes and other times have waited 20 or more.   Example of great driver, last month I took them home from a flight from Denver. The driver had us in stitches over stories he had heard about airline passengers and the strange things they bring aboard their flights. I was skeptical over the Potbelly Pig and Miny pony story until the guy whips out his camera phone and shows me the pictures. Here is the evidence of this huge pig that literally pooped all over the plane and even tried to attack crew and customers. But, hey he is a service pig ya know. (Insert eye roll here) So I digress. The reason I mention is this I am laughing so hard when he pulls up to my home that I apparently left my really cool, wool coat on the floor of the van. So now only in Phoenix would someone not miss their winter coat until like a month later, right?  But alas, on the one really cold night of the year I realize I have not seen this coat since Denver. Sooooo, I initiate a week long search that includes Sky Harbor Lost and Found, Southwest Airlines but to no avail. I am extremely sad to believe my coat is lost forever. I love that coat! Then it dawns on me that I took SuperShuttle home this time. Could it be possible? So I email them and a lovely Margarita calls right back ( a person not a drink) to say that they actually have it. Wow! SS is my hero of the 2012 year end. I am very appreciative to the honest driver and to have my coat back. An added bonus is that Margarita grew up in NY. I am also always happy to have a nice conversation with a fellow New Yorker.  See folks, there are still good people left in the world. Thanks Super Shuttle. I tip my New Years Party hat to you. Now if you could only work on that return wait time I would give you 5 stars for sure.

This place is in the neighborhood and I wondered about it. I never thought I would go in a million years. I stopped by tonight because I just missed Subway's door closing. Granted, I did not order much and maybe 10pm on a Sunday night of a holiday weekend was not the best time for them. All I can say is, "Yuk!" The place was disgustingly dirty.      The Chicken Quesadilla and Pineapple Empanada that I received were beyond disgusting. (and I rarely say that about food) The Quesadilla had hardly no cheese on it or maybe none at all. I opened it up to look at it thinking they gave me the wrong order because it did not even look like a Quesadilla. It was very thick and lumpy. Not cooked enough maybe? The Empanada tasted more like a week old donut. It was hard, and stale.      The Salsa Bar was like a Pollo Asada. It had a lot of variety but it was so dirty. Also, none of the sauces had anything special going for them. They did not have any flavor or consistency. One was like water. Ewhhh! I guess people rave about their Carne Asada but I will stick to Gallo Blanco.     I hope I don't get food poisoning. I have to say something positive so I will say the girl who was working the counter was very friendly.

I despise grocery shopping but this Safeway might make me change my mind. I am always greeted kindly, they give a Cardinals discount on game day, and it is never crowded.   There are those that will say Safeway is more expensive and that is probably true. However, if you are not stuck on brand names you can shop sales here and off brands and get out of the store just as cheaply as Fry's. In my new neighborhood there are both locations right across the street from each other. Fry's packed and dirty, Safeway not. I will take the later please.   It is strange to me though and I just do not get, why it is always so slow. I hope they do not close. Every time I go to this location there is no one here. I have gone on all days and different times and it is never crowded. Several times I have been the only person in the store. This is wonderful for me but I wonder how lucrative for Safeway. I am in and out in record time. What a joy to always be first at the cashier and have so many staff members willing to help me.   The only thing I can suggest is a deli bell. The woman made me wait longer than she should have today. I understand they need to do work in the back but a bell might let them know when a customer is waiting.

Was introduced to this place at a street fair and it is pretty good NY pizza. I figured if it could be that good at a fair the restaurant must be wonderful! BAD mistake since I am now addicted to this place.  I love their chicken and Yam Rustica pizza, for a change in pace.  Good place for the foodie in me, bad for the waistline. They have just opened a "Pinkspot" ice cream in the same store and the Tahitiian Coconut milk sorbet is outstanding! If coconut is not your thing they have A Kuaui Pie ice cream that is good too.I Don't understand the bad reviews.I am from Ny and pretty Picky about pizza and this place is pretty good for Phx standards. ( not Ny but who is in Phoenix?) Not everyone likes Good Ny pizza so that could be why some people did not like it. Also the rude service comments, really surprised me. I go here a lot and I am treated like family on every single occassion. I have never had bad service or bad pizza here, not once!  WOW! I wonder if the bad reviews are written by people who have vested interests in other pizza places? Sorry for their bad experience but if you Do like Ny pizza( not everyone does I agree)  you should  try it out. ( Probably not the Rustica, since that is not very Ny but get their slice special, which is a good deal. They have a 2 slice special and a 1 slice with a salad both with drinks and under 6 bucks!!!!!!!_ the only bad thing about the specials you have to have what they already have premade. Sometimes I like a choice but to have their pizza is a good trade off. Happy eating.

Chocolate heaven in a pastry shop and wine bar. The decor is beautiful. Julia is a wonderful and inspiring woman. She should be a motivational speaker. The desserts are scrumptious. A cute place for a gals night out party or shower. Another interesting little FYI Julia just got her own show on TV. Good for her. The only thing I want to know is how she stays so slim eating all that daily decadence.

What a great gem of a restaurant. I was in the area for a conference so met a friend for dinner. Glutten free Garlic bread, Hmmmm? Gluten free bread is pretty nasty so I was skeptical. It was Delish! The Bruschetta was yummy and we split a wonderful salad. Our server was magnificent too. I wish they had a location closer to me. Oh yeah, they have a nice bar too. Thanks Piccazzo's.

I met the doctor through his son who was my first Assistant Principal and it was really a great find. I am only sorry that I stopped seeing him for few years there in between because Lenscrafters messed up my eyes pretty bad and were cruel to me to boot.    I was thrilled to see Barbara's review because I ---100 percent agree. Dr. Fineberg is outstanding. When he moved away from my neighborhood I stopped seeing him for a while and boy did I ever regret it. Now I am happy to drive the extra few miles. I have had the worse issues at other places and won't be leaving his care any time soon. Dr. Fineberg can diagnose and fit you for contact lenses in like 5 minutes flat. He is a loyal, wonderful family man and a great doctor.   Jeremy is the optics guy in the office. He is super sweet, brutally honest, ( Must be a French and NY thing thus why I like him so much) and pretty funny. I always leave with the CORRECT prescription ( Listen up Lenscrafters and Nationwide), no hassle, Foodie tips, ( but I digress) and a smile on my face from the great bedside manner of the entire office staff.    I appreciate the exceptional care my eyes get here. Thank you.

You know I usually avoid thinking of writing a review on something like a drugstore. I figure; "feel bad plus long wait equals crabby Mary". Walgreens is Walgreens, right? However, I stopped at this location on the way home from the clinic not in my hood. I wish I lived closer and could make this my new Walgreens. The folks in the pharmacy were so extra nice to me. I am very grateful! Nice enough for me to give them a shout out on Yelp. I really appreciated it. Also, they filled my script in ten minutes. WHAT????????????? lol! That is so awesome! When you don't feel so great you don't want to wait 40 plus minutes for a RX.

Beautiful and multifaceted facility. They even have a Jazz Cabaret theater. Wow, sorry to have missed that. Just means a return trip is needed.  Hint, hint a showing of, "Cabaret" please. I saw a show at the Reynolds Hall facility. Wonderful. The grounds are also very lovely.   The staff is amazing! On several levels I can say this. I had all types of adventures the  evening I visited, to say the least. From road closures, to my non scanning ticket, to an  injury in the parking lot afterwards that I witnessed and helped with.  Everyone was absolutely amazing! The traffic directors, ( there are lots of them) To Ruben the House Manager,  to the ticket box office workers who helped me to get a new ticket, to the security patrol woman on the bike that helped after the show, you all sure do know your stuff. You certainly were challenged the evening of June 23 for sure and came through just as brilliantly as the cast of the show.   Thank you for keeping me safe and immersed in Fine Art's experiences. Bravo/a!  PS- the only thing you might want to improve upon is when an internet ticket does not scan. The person with the scanner gun should not bark at you, telling you that your ticket is no good. The box office worker explained that it happens a lot. You might want to fix that. Good thing I was not running late.

I went here based on the good reviews and I was so dissapointed! Being an ex Nyer I was dying to find a good deli .This is not it. Now, it is pretty inside with cool, faux, brick walls and an archway that reminds me of a cheesy Italian place back east so my heart went pitter patter when I saw it. I did not have an artisan sandwich nor did I see one on the menu. This place is under new ownership  so perhaps they changed the menu.I kept hearing about how big the sandwiches were but mine was not( 6inch hero roll more or less) . I ordered a chicken salad sandwich and it  was not good at all. I ordered a side of potato salad and it tasted like a cheap grocery store brand. No way could it have been homemade. Oh well the search continues. ( Just wish Cassellas was closer to me) Perhaps I didn't order one of their speciality items. Help me out here and recommend a good sandwich here and I will go back and try it. No tuna please, yuk! This is the second time I have eaten here and both times the meal was not good.

This place is great for Happy Hour. They have three dollar plates. The burgers are Delish! What I love is that they're smaller sliders. The perfect portion sized to get more than one, share, or eat sensibly. The turkey burger is also wonderful. Their Sweet Potato Tots with dipping sauces are the best I have had so far in a fast/casual food joint. The three dollar Sangria's I am told are the Bomb. The service is outstanding here.  Shout out to Mike. I can't wait to go back.

*5 plus stars if you are open minded, do not embarrass easy and want to have some hearty good laughs. This is a definite "Stays in Vegas" experience.   Spoiler alert to follow***************Please do not read unless you know about this place or like to be surprised.   *No stars if you are easily offended or have kids- do not go   *Two and a half stars for the food. lol-- I don't think folks go here for the food. We do not remember what the food tasted like.  Brawhaha  *Drinks look good. We did not have any so no opinion on that but I hear they are awesome and have great specials.   I averaged it out to a 4 star review because it was highly entertaining after we got used to it of course. ;)      We had no idea when we came in why all the servers kept walking past us and refusing to sit us. They continued to ignore us. Then someone came by, looked at us ignored us and then sat the folks last in line. Even they were aghast and murmured a quick, "sorry" to us. We asked to be given a table adding, "We have been here a while." The guy threw the menus at us and said, "Oh ya have have ya? Give me a break. Sit yourselves." We were like, " WTH?"  We were appalled but somehow I recognized something in a fellow actor. Maybe, it was the twinkle in his eye. So before I strangled him and demanded to see his manager, I poked my head into the restaurant to see what was up. Rude caveman sighs, loudly I might add, and begrudgingly walks us to our table. He asked if we had ever heard of the place or been in. When we said, "no" this is when all hell broke loose.  The "stupid" word was used, He yelled as he walked us to our table " Coming through with some Moronic Newbies."  napkins were thrown at us, food passed by with phallic symbols on it, eye rolls of impatience and sympathy from the fellow staffers, etc and so forth. We sat there for about 2 minutes with our jaws on the table before we finally got the fact it was suppose to be this way. Then we rolled on the floor laughing. Of course this just gets the waiter even more annoyed with how silly and dumb we were. lol--- Thank God I am not a prude or embarrassed easily. To be honest I was embarrassed anyway. My friend starts to really get into it and I have to remind her she is a wife, mother, and grandmother so sit the heck down and behave. This is when we noticed the equally offensive slogans, posters hanging around on the walls, the waiter made hats on the fellow customers, and songs being sung for birthday patrons. "My Dearie Goody Two Shoes Ears!" YIKESAROONI!  So as you have gathered by now it is a themed restaurant where they purposely treat you nasty/saracastic/rude/raunchy etc. It gets dirty though so please do not bring kids here. There were tons here when we were there and that really bothered me since there is no warning sign out front. Also,do not go if you are offended by that sort of thing.  What was really fun was whenever a new person comes in. People sit here all day to watch their confused faces, like ours, before they get the joke. It is like the customers are the audience and you are the new actors on stage. When the group of four 80 plus year old's came in and sat next to us we could not control our laughter over their confused and outraged faces. My friend and I were laughing so hard that helped them catch on and finally figured it out. It is an interesting human psychology experiment to watch. Human nature at it's best. Go Gramps and Grams because they were getting into it too! After eating We never wanted to leave the place. We were having so much fun.  Oh to review the food, what food? Don't ask us about the food. We honestly have no idea because we do not remember. We do remember the food and restaurant is beach themed if that helps.  We finally got up to leave after an hour and the manager says, So how was everything?" Before we could answer he says, "Well it had better have been good. You took long enough. Your friend there was all over my man server. Now get the hell out of my place." Brawhahahahahahahahahahah!!!!!! We'll be back next week. JK or are we?

This place is 65 years old. Incredible and  makes me happy to buy local and old. It has a very limited standard burger menu. An old school drive through hamburger stand with like three tables inside. The burger was good, not the best I have had in town but delish and pretty darn yummy. Tasted like the burger from the Burger Factory Shop on 15th ave, which I like too. My burger came with a small fries. The only negative is that it had to be the messiest burger I have ever eaten. lol I also got a coconut and pineapple shake to go and that was very good. I think they won best of Phx one year for their shakes. The man behind the counter is pretty friendly once he warms up to you. I would go back for sure.  As a few other reviewers noted, yes they are very picky about no outside food or drink since it is heath code law violation. However, there is a big sign on the door so you can not really plead ignorance. I know a few other reviewers noted this as a reason not to come back and I find that childish. Yes, some other restaurants do overlook the law it but the fact is, it is still illegal and gross. Just leave it in the car folks and stop complaining about it or holding it against the owner who is rule following. Since it is illegal I never in a million years thought it had to do with greed. I do not fault them for that and they have been open since 1950.   I do admit the no refill soda thing is a bit old school and they should reconsider changing that policy. However, other places still charge for refills too so it is not totally unheard of.  Also, the no bathroom might be an issue for some folks. There is always drive through only if you have bathroom issues.

Not at all impressed. We went here before a show at the Orpheum. Got there 2 hours before and was actually late for the show. ( And it was lunchtime and the restaurant was empty?????????) The food is not very good here. We had a spinach Artichoke dip that needed flavor and my chicken sandwich was overcooked to the point I could not finish it. The service is not good here either. The waiter was cold and unhelpful and we were the only ones in the restaurant. What's that all about? I would not go back here. My friends said there food was ok but mine was not. My fries were cold as well. Again, why????? No one was there but us.  I am also not impressed with a place where you have to ask a waiter for everything all the time. A waiter should kind of see you need a water refill. I should have read the reviews before I suggested this place.I am glad my friends were ok with it. I was a little emabrrassed that I did not do my usual foodie homework,

My friend loves this place and took me here for my birthday, Scratch is a very different, and I am guessing an acquired taste, type of place. Small menu. Mostly Brie, goat cheese etc. I had a Chicken Caprese Sandwich- Yum very good and the salad on the side was delicious! My friend had a Brie sandwich ( I hate Brie so I did not try it but she said it was great) The pastries here are very unique. I have had them a few times now. Rose and Lavender flavored deserts which are very unique. I hated both but only because I do not like flowery tasting food but I can see they are made with high quality and fresh ingredients. I love the hazelnut opera cake and the meringue was interesting( Salted caramel) I also had a rum tort like dark choco opera cake.YUMMY!!!! The service was good for us despite the other reviewers. I would eat here a lot more if it was in the neighborhood.  Limited menu but I want to try some of the other sandwiches.

Started out very nervous. I had heard great things about this place and wanted to give a fellow ASU alum some business. I walked in and the hostess was not very friendly. In fact, I thought she was kind of rude. Maybe it was just me. I felt very awkward and uncomfortable for some reason but could not explain why. The restaurant itself is very pretty and hip. They also have a nice outside seating area leading to Mill and that wraps around 6th Street.     My experience did improve after a little while. I ordered the Truffle pizza. I asked them to add sausage because I saw it was real and Schrieners to boot, not that fake crumbly junky stuff. I also ordered a side salad. Well you can't do too much to kill a side salad so that was fine. The waiter and another gentleman staff member ( perhaps a manager) were great while I waited for my pizza. It kind of made up for the hostess!!!!! I would get rid of her. Okay maybe a chat first. lol    Well, then the pizza comes out and it is slightly burnt on top. Owhhhhhh, I hate when my pizza is burnt in any shape or form. I know that is the hip new way to eat pizza but not for me. I don't get it. Not this New York Gal. I like it with no burnt marks at all. I was all set to send it back when I decided to try it first.( I rarely send food back since I have a severe issue with waste) I have to tell you I thought it was very good. The spinach meshed perfect with this creamy goat cheese they use for a unique, yummy flavor. I really enjoyed it. I was not that crazy about the burnt crust though thus the 4 stars instead of five. I might come back again this Saturday after the run to try some other things.     What really saved the day was the nice waiter. He talked with me for a long while. He told me all about the owner and his other establishments. We talked shop, which means food. Teehee! The waiter seemed very glad to have me for a costumer. I like that. I wish I knew his name. I usually note that but after a long week of  testing I guess I just wanted to stuff my face with good pizza. lol! Manga!

A few months ago I drove by my favorite, remind me of back east wonderful Pizza place, and cried when I noticed it was gone. After sitting down and crying with a few friends who loved the place too, we moved on with plenty of grief mgt and support. Today I was thrilled to go here and learn it is the same owners and same place, just a new name. I am back in heaven!  Tonight I tried something different, a caprese salad pannini. It came with home made potato chips. ( Always a plus-yum) and greens to boot (Because you know your body needs those vitamins) The meal was great. I ordered a side servng of an Italian sausgage( My weakness and hard to find good in Az)  One was enough to feed 4. A little spicy and good. The only thing I did not care about was the sauce it was served on. I come from a place where sauce is called gravy and I like sauce thick not thin. But hey, I did not expect the sausage to have any sauce on it so no big deal to me. It was delish!I ended with Tiramusu, always a nice ending. I went home with a 20 extra pounds on my hips and in leftover doggie bags. AHHHHH sweet heaven!

Ok yelpers. Knock it off will ya? No more reviews-teehee! Such a dillema. I read a review from a yelper and have to go check out a new restaurant and God forbid Love it. So many good places, so little time.( And the weight keeps pouring on)  Ok now I am in trouble, Pinos or Metro??????HMMMMM lucky for me one is by work and one is by home so I get the best of both worlds. Anyway this place is pretty new and in a strange strip mall. I walked in two weeks ago and was instantly greeted by the owner who is waiting on tables. Hello!!!The place just jumped 100 points in my food review oriented mind. Very impressive. Ordered pizza, of course and it was not really the oily Ny style that Pinos is going for but more the italian style pizza that Cibo and Bianco is going for. Altthough I have never had Chris's pizza I have had Cibo and do not like it. The pizza here was very good. I liked the sausage. I guess I am a sausage snob and am always trying to find good out here, which is almost impossible for some reason. Of course I had to satisfy my Tirumusu Addiction.Outstanding here too. Now I can't decide which I like better but to be honest it is one of the best three I have had and I have had it all over the world. Taste test time. OH HOW SAD! I can think of worse evils than going back and forth and eating good pizza and glorious Tirumusu all night long, all right-LOL! The sevice was outstanding here. The owner is personable, attentive, and chatted up a storm with me about  how he moved here from italy with his american wife and is opening a new Scottsdale store that sadly he will be moving to work at. I am sure his Phx customers will miss that smile and wonderful personaility! And when the relief waiter came on and picked up the service towards the end of my  meal, I had a nice surprise and chuckle. It turns out he was a student at the school I worked at and had my friend for his 5th grade teacher. That was funny! I promised him I would bring my friend in for some good pizza  and desert and his response was just so funny! ( Telling me I had better not because he was a rotten kid back then and she would throw the pie back in his face) I I laughed so hard at the joke( or maybe he wasn't kidding. HMMMMM I guess I will just have to go back and find out and oh yeah eat while I AM checking out my hypothesIs-LOL)  and realized the entire dining,and fun laughter of an experience had just endeared this place in my heart for good. I can't wait to go back!!!!!

The food has gone downhill since they closed the Scottsdale location and got new owners or cooks or whomever. I had not eaten here in a long time because the last few times I had been in the pizza was not as good as it used to be. I also had found a better place closer to home. Well, I thought I would give them another try tonight since the reviews are still good. It had been a long, hectic week at work. I happen to be driving by and I just wanted to sit down with my new book and eat. This was a very strange and demeaning experience. I have never had anything like this ever happen to me before. It upset me so I was compelled to write this update.    This restaurant is very small. Too small for how popular it seems to be. They have only five tables in the place and if you sit at two of them it is very awkward since you are right by the kitchen door ( And in the way) or under the TV. I apparently forgot about that tonight.  It is certainly not a place to bring a party of fifteen and then book a party of eight.   I walked in and there was a very long table of about 20 up against the wall. They really did not fit in the restaurant at all. The kids with them were very noisy and not being disciplined of course by any adults. The other three small tables were filled with diners looking non too happy at the noise level and squished floor space. I should have left right then and there but I was in no rush. I noticed that two of the "Two Top" tables were finishing up so I waited by the kitchen window to sit. Again, very awkward just standing there. I felt so in the way.  The server looked at me and said, "Just give me just one minute. Here is a menu." Well, I stood there for about fifteen minutes.   A couple left shortly after that. I assumed the table would be cleared for me but it never happened. I stood by the window for five more minutes waiting. Finally, I sat down at one of the tables. A busser and a staff member walked by twice and no one cleared the table or acknowledged me. I started looking at the menu. After ten more minutes the waitress came back and said. "So are you wanting to eat? I was flabbergasted. I am thinking to myself, "What the heck?" "Well, YES! I do want to eat since this is a restaurant, right? But I meekly look at her, smile, and say, " Of course." Maybe she is having an off night with that crazy 20 top over on the wall. Needless to say I was very confused and starting to get frustrated. I wasn't sure how to answer or what she was trying to communicate. I assumed she forgot that she already asked me if I wanted take out or not. Not being a Harvard attorney I wanted to make sure to not go all postal on her.    Well, the waitress finally asks, "Well, do you want to eat here?" I might note that she has made no effort to start clearing the dirty table either. So now I am very confused. Shall I eat here? What is that suppose to mean? Shall I eat here? Well heck no, maybe I will eat in the kitchen, bathroom, or on the floor? In the parking lot? I can only conclude they do not want my business. I am thinking to myself, "Is this a joke? Am I on one of those reality TV shows? What is the problem here?" I have no idea what is going on.  She then looks at me and says, "Well, SHE said there is a reservation at eight."( I still have no idea who "SHE" is.) I looked at my watch which said 7:10pm. Again, super confused hungry gal here. Also, what does this have to do with me anyway? The server finally gets her act together to tell me they have a table of eight coming in with a reservation, not a reservation at 8pm. Wow, reservations at this place, Really? Okay, I still had no idea when or why she was telling me this since I was at a Two Top not an Eight Top. The only other tables in the place were Two Tops that all together did not add up to eight. A reservation of eight would not fit anywhere in this place, anytime soon.  I finally looked at her, forcing her to communicate. "So are you saying you do not want to serve me? Do you not have room for me?" I hate being a mind reader on a Friday night after working with 8 year old kids all day. To this question the server replies, "No not at all. She says ( Who the heck is SHE?)  that we can bring you food. It has to be fast and you have to eat it fast. We need your table." Now I get it! I can not reply though because my jaw has fallen to the floor in utter shock at her request. I walked out on the spot.    I was not sure how I felt about this. I totally understand having no room or a wait time. I even understand a reservation system since I eat out a lot. ( But shocked that such a divey place in the hood would take them) I can even understand they can not expand their space just for lil ole me. However, what I can not understand in any shape or form is why no one thought to tell me any of this before I wasted 30 minutes of my Friday night just standing there. Also, to tell a customer they need to rush their food intake, at an Italian place no less, is sinful!

I believe this is an ice cream store started in Hawaii. The Coconut Ice cream is to die for! I like Pink Spot. It is no longer convenient for me to go here but I miss it.( I used to live right down the street) I can go to Z- PIzza for a slice then have a nice treat here. The two are connected and owned by the same folks. Check it out.

I am also reviewing Central and Camelback location. ( New last month)! I Love DB!!! There coffee is better than the other coffee shops in town. (Or just as good) they  have funky flavors like Almond Joy, ( Love my coconut)  Milky Way( Which I am assured is awesome)  and Kahlua Kicker. So far I have tried the Almond Joy and the  Kahlua Kicker.  A few other  things about DB that I want to mention. The service here is outstanding! I think they interview the kids at the comedy store before they hire them.lol! Every time I have gone to a DB I have gotten a little show, a funny little joke, or just darn special service. I LOVE IT!!!!! Last night I stopped by the Central location and got the wonderful young man to give me a little show with the throwing of the bottles in the air a la Tom Cruise "Cocktail" style. Very fun! And he was a very nice, attentive young man. It makes going there so nice! PS-The last thing to note is  that they have a special coffee cup that they invented with a raised lip. It is perfect! i never burn my lips!!!!!

I have been going for many years and I simply adore BenOra. They treat me so well here. usually I go on Saturdays and I have had the same woman every time. She actually remembers me. Today I went during the week and had another technician just as nice. She was most respectful, gentle, and treated me with the up-most dignity. In today's medical environment of crassness, and impersonal services this is a wonderful jewel in the rough place to go for all your woman's diagnostic needs.

My favorite grocery store. I am so sad it is not as close after moving. Their food is Delish. So many things are sooooooo good here but my favorite two things are their Lemon Cilantro Hummus and the, "Eat Your Greens" Veggie Soup. I love the half off selections too. That helps with the budget. Great for a smaller family or when you need an, "in between, pick up a few things" shop. The ads on the radio are a hoot, if I do say so myself.

Finally was able to go after hearing so much about it. Yes, they do have original LI Potato Salad. Wewhoo. I have been searching for that since I moved here 30 plus years ago. The Chicken Salad sandwich I had was very good, NY style, and yummy tasting. It wasn't as good as Cassella's but what is? The other items here all looked so good and the place was packed. I just wish the bread here in Az was as good as NY. I had a Kaiser Roll today while good, not NY great. I also took home a Potato Knish which was delish! Pardon the rhyme.     I will have to go back and try some of their other items. I agree with the other posters that his place has a very NY environment and feel. However, I have never seen a deli owner in NY with a gun strapped to her waist. lol---the owner is hilariously NY. A  little Bit Hero Natzi in Soup Natzi style from Seinfeld. ( but a nice Hero Natzi) I heard her tell a customer "Come on, Sh-- now. Whatcha want let's go, honey"-- LOL--- transported me right back to the old neighborhood. I had a good chuckle over it. Secretly, I loved her. We chatted The old hood for a while.   So I will be back to try some of their other items and maybe get some Cold Cuts to go. I will definitely be back to order the Potato Salad in gallon jugs. ----:0)

I am updating my review with 5 starts for their salads because I love them. Az is seriously lacking in good delis in town. The only NY based deli I can find in Phoenix with Long Island Style Potato salad and I have looked everywhere. They also have Knishes which are hard to find too. They do run out though, insert sad face.   I love to come here when I am in Downtown. Nicole reminds me of home. She is so NY. I love her stories. You will hear them if you visit. Don't be shy or prudish when visiting here. Ha! You will get an earful.    Cassellas in Scottsdale and Hero factory in Phoenix are the two best delis in town. The only bad thing is the location and hours. If you do not work in downtown it is hard to get here. I do see they are open on Saturdays now so that is better. The sandwiches are pretty tasty here. So far I have had chicken salad, turkey and roast beef. All of them delish! Some folks have commented on the bread. I like their sesame seed sub rolls. They are not as good as NY, but what is?

The girls who worked here upped it from three stars to four. They are super sweet! This poor place and me seemed to have a love hate relationship from the start. I have been trying to go here for a while but something always happened. It was closed, we decide to go elsewhere, my car broke down, etc. Well, today I was determined to use my Restaurant.com gift certificate to go. I had errands to run in the neighborhood too so I looked up the opening time and was promptly there at 9:00 am. Well, they were not open even though that is the time listed on their website and the front door. I then notice there is a little sign under the door etchings that say that they are not really open until 10am on Saturday. "Arghhhhh," Jinxed again. lol-- okay so I leave and do some more errands and come back. I am at the door at 10am and it is still not open. If I was not a determined person and a stubborn New Yorker when it comes to trying new food places, they probably would have lost a customer.      The gal working there shows up at 10:02am and opens up. Their staff do not show up 30 minutes or more early so you might want to note that when you go. I then see that they have a fantastic Yelp check in deal too. Which deal to use? Decisions, Decisions? For some reason the internet is not allowing me to reopen the saved Yelp deal. No biggie, I go back to the Restaurant.com deal instead. (by the way this was an awesome deal for sure! 2 sandwiches for 5 dollars, 2 cookies and a drink too.)      The place is small and sweet with a cute sidewalk area too. The food was good, not great. I liked the sandwiches I had so I want to go back and try them all. Unique menu. I do feel the sandwiches are not overstuffed though. ( but I always think Carnegie Deli when I hear the words overstuffed sandwiches) I think their Chicken Salad is very good. One of the better ones in town. I also got a Charlie Brown to go. (Roast Beef and Cukes, "Meh" but how do you spice that up? ) I liked that they have Onion Rolls. I love Onion rolls. Yummy!!!!! Still not as good as NY ones though but what is? -lol ;) The cookies I had were good. ( Again, not great or to die for)      I liked the place and would definitely go back despite the messy way I finally got to enjoy it. lol. Since it is local owned I have to try to support local business. The food was good enough for me to want to keep coming back. I just think they should work out some of the kinks.      A special thank you to the two nice ladies working the counter.

I am always treated like Family at Pizza A Metro and have been bugged to try Amarone, the owners new location.  My Ny upbringing and foodie inner child always cry when i go here!!!!!!Simply gorgeous! The food is great at both locations. The decor is very pretty at Amarone. ( I liked the funky bathroom) The pizza is just as good as Bianco's but here you are family. Isn't that part of why you eat out for great service? When I eat here I am treated like royalty.Things to try; the Veal Cannoloni, the ravioli, the marinara is one of the best I have had out of NY. I cried-BOOHOOO when they stopped serving it with their flat bread. All the pizza is great too. I have had Tiramasu all over the world and it is the best I have ever had here. I do not believe the other two negative reviewers. The first one making it appear and implying the owner is prejudice. He is from Italy his wife is American. My friend is in a mixed race marriage and has always been treated well here and I have been always been treated as though a guest in his home,even on the first visit! I also think the Caprese salad is great. It is not as good as Bianco's, true, but it is better than the other reviewer made it out to be and I have had hundreds of plates of the stuff all over the USA and Europe. Besides, I do not want to wait three hours for a great Caprese Salad when I have Amarone and Pizza A Metro to go to!!!!!!The only negatives is that I go way to much and I am getting so FAT!!!!! I live in the west valley so I go to the West Valley location like once a week. It is getting out of hand this addiction of mine, but Michael the manager is a dear heart and treats me right, and the food is to die for. Remember when you lived back east and you went to your fav Italian location and got a double cheek kiss from everyone and treated so right??????.Well here ya go. "MEMORIES LIGHT THE CORNERS OF MY MIND!!!!!  AHHHHH not in the past in Phx anymore. Keep up the great work guys!!!!! And to all the readers, please visit both locations. Amarone for a fancier evening out and Pizza A Metro for a casual experience. MANGA AND GRAZII!!!!!!

Owwwwwhhhhhhhhh, this place is sooooooo delightful! The staff here, especially the blonde dude working the counter, are totally awesome, helpful gems. I forgot about this place and have been wanting to check it out since the remodel. Being in the neighborhood I stopped by. I always felt the name of this place says it all. One of those vintage old house reinvented into a restaurant. Each room is meant to be like a different reading/relaxing nook areas. Different feel, different decorations, different furniture, with a different thematic feel to each room. I sat in the silver furniture section-ha. Love the bookshelves with reading material. If you pick the back room I guarantee you will probably forget you are in a restaurant. It even has a TV.  Also, the entire place is covered with art work hanging on the walls for sale, by I assume local artists. They also have some jewelry for sale. BUY LOCAL! GOTTA LOVE IT! This is a totally fun and cute place. Very artistic for my inner creative Drama Queen. The place was also packed.     Ok, so now onto the food. I am a chicken salad fanatic so I got the Voodoo Chicken Salad for something totally different and unique. I think I got it because the name was so clever. Cajun Chicken Salad= Voodoo ha, ha, ha! Honestly, I was not really in love with it through no fault of the restaurants. It is just very different. I think I will just stick with my traditional view of white regular chicken salad and my addiction to Casella's Deli-the best!. However, this sandwich was still tasty enough. I would like to go back and try some other Hobnob sandwiches and or salads especially since I hear their Hummus is the best in town. On the way out I got all excited because I spied a Black and White cookie out of NY. I had already ordered a slice of their Coconut Cake which BTW I am eating right now as inspiration while writing this review. ( It is good) I can't wait to try the B/W cookie later or tomorrow for an Easter treat,  Finally, since it is a coffee house I got a White Chocolate Mocha for the road. The server was so helpful when he recommended I add Cinnamon and Caramel topping and sauce flavoring to it. Add it, I did and it was divine! All in all a fattening day here in Phoenix.To end this review I do have to say parking is awful and the place is pricey but as Arnold likes to say,  "I'll be back."

I have been dying to go here since a coworker's spouse is one of the chefs. We finally went  last night  before the Symphony and it was a very good dining experience. The food came impossibly fast. The shrimp and Sausage Po Boy sliders were heavenly. The bread is this roll type of joy like break back east. Yum. You know the type of bread you can't find in AZ or west of the Rockies as Al Pacino would say-lol!They also served the bread basket with a veggie type of garnish if mixed with butter and put on the bread it had a very pleasing taste to it. Innovative menu- Lobster Potpie and Duck Quesadillas. HMMMMMM! Interesting. I had a side of Mac and cheese which is what I had heard about for so long and a Caprese Salad. My friend had divine Salmon. I am not a Salmon fan but i tasted it and it was yummers. My Ice tea was tasty and my friend had  a Basil Mojito that was mixed well. I don't like them usually because they are so strong mouthwashy tasting, but this had a nice blend to it. The restaurant decor is beautiful.We did not get desert but I want to go back and try those Seasalt sticks. All in all I loved going here. DT was packed last night due to Wrestle-Mania but we were in and out  in an hour at 5ish, so try that time to avoid crowds. Service was great despite other reviews. I know great service and I had it.

It is always so nice to eat here. I have never had a bad meal at any Wildflower. Today I went crazy and tried something not of a Chicken Salad nature.--lol-- I know shocking! I had the Sweet Potato Sandwich ( weird sounding, huh? ) and Vegetarian Lentil Tomato soup. Ummmmm, delish, delish, delish. The place is always so crowded though and you have to fight to get a table at times but the service is still very good. Everyone is smiling and helpful. I love that it is connected to Changing Hands Bookstore too.   I took home a home made pretzel and a Ginger Oatmeal Biscotti. YUMMY!

Wow, what rock have I been hiding under? And right in my "Hood." Thanks Yelp for the suggestion. I have passed it many times but never thought go go in. This place totally reminds me of the Deli/Convenient stores located near my Aunt's in Rockaway/Queens, right down to the "Iffy" neighborhood and the DVD's in the front case. It is a bit of a Divey, little place where you can get a sandwich, sit down at one of the 8 or so tables, get Takeaway, and/or pick up some staples while you are there. I was immediately transported back to NY the minute I stepped into the place.   I got the Roast Beef Hero, which was good. I also got a side of Potato Salad which was just average. That is okay though because no one knows how to do NY Potato Salad out here. ( Wait, I take that back. Hero Factory in Downtown Phoenix does) Ralph's negatives are: a very small menu, no chicken salad, no Wise products, and keeping in the NY theme, horrific parking.   I have to say the folks who work here are awesome, by the way. The owner is from Westchester county. ( upstate for us Long Islanders. Sorry a NY private joke which even the owner knew. lol--Love it) The young man working the counter was so very nice to me. I think I found a new place to lunch. No more hiding. That "Proverbial" Rock has been outed and overturned.

The other reviewers were pretty close. I do think the place is super cute with lots of potential though. They need to redesign the new space they bought to match the cute original space next door. An artist could do wonders with those walls. They should make a super cool wall art mural like they have in the original space but even better. I liked the espresso bar and the old school diner look for sure but I sat in the new area and it was pretty ugly, dirty, grungy looking. Flies at the window. I hate that in older buildings.   Let's start with the name of the place. Why is it called the lunch box and it has only four lunch options? The name is so confusing to me. It is more for breakfast which I did not stop by for. The menu is not correct online and it is very limited. It is also labeled American cuisine but with a mostly Mexican food menu. They do have a Gyro on the menu and some burgers but most of the their food is Mexican breakfast and I am not a fan of fast food Mexican food nor breakfast, usually.   They do not serve drinks in glasses or cups. I was handed a water in a to go, plastic cup that actually had a bug or seed or something on the cup lip. Also, I have an issue with this from an environmental viewpoint. That is a lot of trash to generate every day. I ordered an Ice tea, and that was fine but only because they did not have any drinks that were diet. Really? I ended up ordering a turkey sandwich by default. The menu says it is actually cooked turkey but it was cold cuts or pressed. It was not fresh cooked turkey. Nothing special. It tasted like a school lunch sandwich. I could have made one at home for less than 2 bucks or bought at school for 50 cents more. It also had an odd taste to it. The sandwich came with fries that tasted very strange. I can not put my finger on it but they were awful and tasted very off. Like nothing I have ever tasted before. I have no idea why but i am guessing the oil. The potatoes were also rawish.   I had no issue with the service as others stated. In fact the ladies working there are delightful! (thus the one star instead of zero) Yes, at first it seemed slow because I did not know if I could just sit myself or what. However, then it picked up. They are busy so the ladies work hard. However, they were very personable. Surprisingly, the place had a lot of customers. I sure do not get that but it seemed like the people in there were not foodies.

I hate this place. Ok granted I have only had about 20 pedis in my entire life, and only two other places to compare it with, and my feet are awfully ticklish but I really don't think I am the worlds pickiest, princess. I had been going here for two years  because it is right next to Massage Envy. One stop pampering huh? You would think. and  it took me a while to write a review because I could not put my finger on what it was about this place I hated but I think I have it now. I went 4 or 5 times and I alway felt very uncomfortable here. I wasn't sure why but I think it was because I felt like I was a  member of a cattle herd. In and out, no smile,  no service. They were always in a rush to get me done and onto the next person waiting. Welllllll,  a pedi is a splurge and  a treat to your inner peace and not cheap SOOO, since I am paying you a bit of my hard earned money could you at least act like you like me and or the fact that I am the paying customer? Oh well,  I kind of blew it off and figured all places were like this.( Even though the other two places I had been to in the past were not  like this)  I continued to go because this place was a little cheaper and more convenient.  I went back a few more times until The last time I went in this past winter. That was the last straw. ( Plus they raised their prices!) The girl was so rude to me for no reason known. I was very nice to her and she just kept ignoring me and hurting me. I asked her to go easier and she did not  and rolled her eyes. At the end of the pedicure she did not give me the sandals they usually give for drying time and  tried to put my shoes back on to soon and smeared the polish on my big toe. OMG she acted like it was all my fault. She actually got mad at me! She  rolled her eyes and got really bent out of shape!I couldn't believe it. She huffed and puffed back to get the polish remover and mumbled when she had to repaint my toe. After she repainted my toe she again tried to put my shoe back on without any dry time.  Well somehow my foot tensed up as I tried to help her out by pushing my foot a little into the shoe and she had the nerve to yell at me and slapped my foot. She barked "STOP IT!" and told me to cut it out and relax my foot and again with the rolling of her eyes with a side helping of attitude. What is this all about?????Are all pedi place like this I wonder. Follow up- Months later-  Ok, so today my friend tells me she  had a pedi yesterday and the lady told her her feet were ugly.  (They are not,. She is a gorgeous gal all around. However,  either way HELLO???? Are you really gonna tell your client that? JEEEEEZZ LOUISE).  Lo and behold, yup, you guessed it, the same place! YIKES!!!! RUN AWAY! I went to the place in Spectrum Mall and had a better pedi and it was much cheaper.

I love the idea of wine bars but I don't like wine or cheese that much. Lol! With that said I did have a very nice afternoon here. I had Ice tea, which BTW is good. We ordered two Bruschetta platters and I have to admit I loved them. We totally wiped them out. While I think Brie is gross by itself, it sure tastes good when mixed with things like Apples, Pistachios, Salami, Pesto, Tomatoes. and Proscuitto. Our server was a doll as well. A few negatives. We went at 2pm and the place was packed!( Doesn't anyone work on Fridays?lol And if you are unemployed how do you afford to sit in a wine bar?) By 4:00 though the place was dead, just in time for us to leave to catch our movie.-Hmmmmm that didn't make sense to me at all so not sure if that is the norm here. The parking is kind of an issue here. Even though it is free to have them valet your car it is crazy trying to get to the back lot and dangerous. I almost got hit twice. And crazy drivers just leave their cars right out in the middle of the street. Very odd they don't get a ticket or hit. Another issue I have is kids in bars. I don't agree with it and I saw several. I just don't get that at all. I really don't consider Postinos a restaurant or a kid friendly place but hey that's the teacher in me. All in all the food is good here. The restaurant is hip and warehousey looking and we had super great service! I'd go back. ( but maybe at 4pm-ha!)

What a fun place. I really enjoyed the experience. I am not sure I was that crazy about the food but that was through no faulty of the restaurant. I ordered a veg dish and a crepe type of french naming Empanada thing. Sorry forgot the name. It was stuffed with carrots and other veggies. ( that dish, by the way, was awesomely delish.)   My veggies were overcooked and a little slimy but it still tasted okay. Since I am not a veggie maybe it should have come that way. I just can't eat the soy or fake meat so I did not order any of those types of dishes. I have to admit their menu is extensive with tons of choices.   I guess I will have to go back for the Hawaiian burger, I see. I almost ordered that.  Everyone on here is saying it is delish.   The server/owner??She is a Dearheart for sure. 4 stars from me. Three for the food. I would go back.

This restaurant scares me. I lost 45 pounds and i can see it coming back real fast. LOl. I used to live right across the street and am so glad I don't anymore-hahahaha. i have eaten here twice and all the things I have eaten are the bomb! What stands out is the corn app, the guacamole is the  best I have had in a restaurant, and the Carne Aasda taquitas and torta! i also loved the platano crepes. The restaurant itself is kind of ugly and was dirty the first time i went and the service is a bit lacking but the food is not! Enjoy!

I have eaten here 5 times now plus attended a political party once. The Carne Asada Torta and Guac make me dream of Mexico. The food is great here but the restaurant itself not so much. The patio has a nicer feel.  Enjoy!

I was a little nervous reading the reviews about kids in bars which is not okay and not like one Yelper wrote, "innovative" by the owners. Hire a babysitter if you want to go out to a bar. A non supervised play area in a bar is frightening concept to this teacher.  However, it was my BFF's birthday and this is where we were going so I bit the bullet.    I was pleasantly surprised. There were no kids there on a Saturday at 8pm. I was thrilled about how much fun we all had. One of the owners/investors hung out and joked around with us for a little while, and the service was great! The place is more like a "U" shaped restaurant then a bar, and looked to have a pretty patio although I never made it out there. We loved the band that was playing. ( "The Real Thing." Boy, those gals can sing. Check em out)  We even made our own dance floor and danced the night away,   The food was yet another surprise. It was good for bar food. The pretzel was amazing! Soft and fluffy with some type of cheesy/hummus/artichoke/whatever sauce that 8 gals had a different opinion on what was in it but all agreed was Super Delish! We also had the Tater Tots, ( Crunchy and flavorful) Teriyaki Wings,( YUM) and a Hummus Duo dish. ( It was "Okay" for Ms. Picky on the Hummus here) The drinks were drinks, I mean how do you review alcohol? lol Just kidding, I had a "Dragons Bite" which is like a fruit type tasting drink. I tasted the "Cesar Tangerine" too. They also have a few ice tea options for the DDs and Teetotalers.  There were a few negatives deducting a star. The valet closed at 9pm. We did not get that at all. The bar died down at around 10:30 pm which is way too early even for AZ Standards forcing us to head next door to JT's for two hours. This is another factor that cements it in my mind they are more like a restaurant, not a bar. They forgot my Yelp check in credit on the final bill, they advertised a special on their website that they did not honor ( a business should always honor these things)  and the back bathroom by the Kiddieland had an issue with the door closing. This might make for an awkward scene for sure if a child or other drunk patron walked in on you.("Onsie" stall and the Main door leading to the eating area does not close right. ArcadiaTavern, you need to fix that)   So, if you want a restaurant atmosphere with sports on the TV's, yummy food, and music, this place is great. If you want a bar atmosphere, maybe not so much. I myself really liked it for what it was. Thank you AT for the fun. You just need to lose the kids area please, Okay?

I am reviewing Sunday Brunch at Wrights. LOVELY and Outstanding ! James our server was a dear, the food was delish! I wish I had more room for all those wonderful desserts, Very unique menu, Veal Stroganoff. Vanilla Bean Soaked infused fruit salad with Pineapple.  Banana Cream and Caramel Brule. The cold buffet included all the standards like shrimp, italian ham, Caprese, Muffins, Scones, and Breads. Loved the Zucchini bread.  The hot menu upgrade included Lobster Eggs Benedict, Lavender Infused Waffles, Flapjacks, Organic Tortilla Chicken. It was delightful! The resort is so beautiful. Looks like a type of old school, European Castle. The lobby  is gorgeous! Parking is not that great here though. This was a lovely day treat!

Good thing this place has a lot of good reviews or I would never go back.  Since I worked in the Biz  and I am a forgiving person when I think a place may have had an off night. I promise to try it again and repost another review.(  But don't let me down when I go back! Ok Parlor? )   The food was not good at all. In fact it should never have left the kitchen. Long story but the chef  was very negligent with our meal and should have never served the food he or she did. My very upset friend won't return. I had the pizza which was bland and flavorless. The crust was good but I am at a loss why people think this is the best pizza in town. It wasn't bad per say, just not great.I am coming to the realization that no pizza here will ever live up to a true NY pizza slice. I am just picky in that regards and am finding I am not a lover of the real Italian/woodfire/whatever way of making pizza nowadays, despite the authenticity. I just long for a slice of Pizza that reminds me of my roots.   The only thing that saved the day here is the service, which was outstanding!  They did everything right. Even the waiter seemed displeased with the chef's error. The manager and server were  great and i notice those things. The restaurant is also very pretty and we had no wait time when we went. ( So go before 6ish on a Saturday. It got packed shortly after)   On a key note the french pressed coffee and Tiramusu are great here! They have these Hazelnut chip pieces on top that were scrumptious!  This might be a new, great dessert place for me, if the food doesn't please me on the next visit.   Ok Parlor, until  next time!

Ok, so a friend went here last week and got a severe case of food poisoning, involving a hospital visit HUH? HMMMM, 0-2 so I think that' s it for me  trying this place again. I will have to take back my original promise to eat here again.  I am at a loss as to why the great reviews.

I had a free certificate from a coworker that I finally put to good use.I had airplane neck syndrome-teehhhee! Ok, so here is how this place works. It is a school so do not expect resort, spoil me princess service and amenities. With that said I had better service here then I have had at one of those fancier places that will remain nameless. You go in and give your name. I had always been told you have to wait a  very longtime but I only waited 15 minutes tops. You can't beat the prices here. When you do have to pay and are not lucky enough to have a coupon or gift certificate it is only 25 dollars and they don't allow tips. This is the  most economical massage in town. Now they are students but Angie did a good job for me and was graduating in three weeks so all was well.It is a bit different from a spa, resort, or Massage Envy so heads up. You do not have your own private room. ( But you will get plenty of privacy. I did not feel this was a  problem only different then what I am used to) It is kind of like a big triage center in the Er with all the white curtains and individual room areas and such but no walls. However,  they have it set up so you are tucked into corners and do not have to worry about someone just whipping a curtain open on you.  Since you do not have your private room it is dead quiet all around you because I am assuming people do not want to talk to disturb you. Every now and then you hear whispering. It is also weird to hear the hitting of the therapists hands on the skin of people next to you not being your own-hahaha. The music is a bit to loud for my liking. I assume it is piped in for all to hear and the room is freezing. Now I know all massage rooms are always  freezing but the fancy places  have warming tables. NO frills here thus the cheap price for a good massage.  I think it is worth it to come here. My neck feels a lot better. I do like a very hard massage but I wasn't sure if you could request a pressure change and to be honest I did not want to freak out the poor girl by telling her to tear up my muscles. LOL. The day I went I lucked out too. They asked for volunteers for a turnaround service massage. I did not do this but how cool was this offer.  When I went to leave the sign on the door said turn around and sign in again for another hour massage for free! They needed more clients. WOW!!!! That would have been a steal if I took advantage of that deal. They also run two for one coupons I hear form my friends. I give this place 4 stars because you will not get 100 percent spoiled like at a spa but the massage was almost equivalent to the ones I have received elsewhere and the price is a steal!

Cheap happy hour specials 3 and 4 dollar plates. Typical bar food except somehow the Buffalo Chips were slightly addicting. They sounded gross but I could not stop eating them. Homemade chips, hot sauce, and mild blue cheese. For my meal I got the Kolbe Burger which was delicious.

A first date wonderful experience. Thanks server Scott. Started with Escorgot- ( Hey while in France, right? ) I still smell like garlic butter. lol! I Loved the cheese herb rolls. for diner I ordered something I do not normally like or eat, pork. I  had the pork chop which did not taste like a pork chop. It was delish, melted in my mouth. Loved the pepper mixed salsa that came on top. The Creme Brulle is to die for. I am not the biggest fan of french food but I loved my dinner experience. We did go early so it was not busy at all. Charming restaurant, all wood like a little cabin in the french countryside. Liked the small chandeliers and minimalist decor and  art work. Nice bathrooms too. Good job PM!

I finally went to Lo-Lo's yesterday for a late lunch or early dinner. After dreaming and hearing about it for years we visited the new Scottsdale location and were not disappointed. There was no wait. We did go off hours though. My guy tells me the place is always packed, so be forewarned.  We both got the Betty Boop and it was yummers. They have fantastic waffles here. Moist, with a hint of cinnamon! AWESOME! The chicken was delish. I loved the golden batter outside more than the chicken inside-teehee! The thing that really rocked it for me was the service! Outstanding! I love Carl. Carl rocks. His twin brother Micheal works there too.  In fact everyone treated us very welcoming, as house guests. Which kind of fits the down home, southern feel of the place.  I like it here very much and can't wait to go back, My diet can, but I can't- lol. Yes the food is not that good for you so it will have to be a once in a while splurge. Enjoy!

Oh dear, how awful! 13 dollars for a wrap type of Pannini sandwich, cold fries and not very good Sweet potato chips that they swear are homemade. Hmmmmmm!  I came home to food poisoning and I have a flight to catch tomorrow. I did like the Jalapeno dipping sauce but what's the point if there is no good food to dip in it? The servers were very nice, and the televisions with sports were a plenty if that's your thing but the food was terrible.

More like 3. 5 stars but I bumped it to four. The food is okay not outstanding and not bad at all. Good lunch specials. A lot of food. I have come to the conclusion that Arizona just does not have any really great Chinese food places. However, I do give this place 5 stars for the service thus the bump. The ladies are the best here. They have the nicest wait staff around.   Another thing to note is that the prices are pretty good here compared to other places in Glendale. When I am sick their Hot and Spicy soup is more economical than other restaurants. It is not as spicy as I like but they happily give me more hot mustard and chili sauce to add at my leisure. I am good.

What a lovely afternoon with fine folks and good food. Viet Kitchen is an aesthetically pleasing restaurant with very friendly staff members and good food. My meal was delicious. I had the Stir Fry--(7A) on the menu. We all shared an order of Spring Rolls.   The only thing strange was that our food all came out at different times instead of all at once. Since it was only a minute or two apart l am okay with it I suppose. Maybe this is how they do it here. That might be an issue for some old school service folks so a heads up. At this location all the staff members chip in so the food was delivered by different servers when it came up. I am okay with that since I like hot, and not sitting until the server can get to it, meal deliveries. I only mention it because I know some folks might be bothered by that. To be honest I like places that group serve. In my opinion it makes the service, and food temperature, better.   I found the staff here to be absolutely wonderful. They fawned all over us from the moment we walked in until the very end of the day when I went back in to use the bathroom. Even after all the customers had left the restaurant and the staff were eating their lunch. They did not act put out that I returned after about 15 minutes. Such nice people. They were very accommodating, nice, helpful, made good suggestion, were always smiling and very friendly.   All in all, I had a great afternoon with precious friends.

Maybe the folks at the 800 number reservation line should find out the location is not outside the mall in the loop but inside the Arrowhead Mall. After driving around for about 30 minutes Christmas week I was told by a lovely shopper crossing the street that I had to go inside the mall. "Sigh! Go in the mall?" Are you serious? Me go into a mall a few days before Christmas? Okay, and oh well, so in I go. I did and the store was reeee-dinki---dink packed. Even with a reservation it took forever. I know I know, every apple store is packed you say? Yes, I get it. It sure is the downside of owning a MAC.   Service here was just okay nothing to write home about. I find the service better at my old hood in the Biltmore. I wasn't sure the woman who helped me really knew what she was doing though. She sounded unsure of herself and lacking confidence. I felt uncomfortable around her. Maybe I am just mad that my laptop is going to cost a fortune to fix, Ha-Ha or rather, Boo-Hoo!  However, while I was waiting though there was one worker there helping an older gentleman. I observed that she was really great. I did not get her name but she is from the Long Island store and just transfered in not long ago. I wish I got her to help me.

I adore this place. I liked it so much I went back the next day while in the neighborhood. The Jive Turkey and the Veggie were yum. My friends tell me the, "Cash Cow" and Italian Ham were great too. Sorry the name of the latter escapes me. The house is darling. I loved the bathroom funny beer sign too. I have to say though they really need to turn down the music. I love loud music. If I am complaining it is way too loud.

I just spent the evening with my new grade level teaching team at the Glendale Melting Pot for a year end celebration. What better way to end the school year than with a bunch of melted cheese and chocolate, well, everything huh?-lol! We laughed a lot and shared great times. The restaurant is dark and pretty. Great bonding place with friends and I can imagine a very romantic date place. The food is good. This is a unique dining experience. At first I was like, "Ok I don't like cheese that much", and, "that sure isn't even close to enough food to fill me up."  Ummmmm, yeah. Ummmmmm, no problem there. It is the next day I am still fully stuffed here. We rolled out of there-lol!I loved every bit of every course.( I really want to go back and try the lobster with the Caribbean style cooking oil. After I hit the lottery of course!) YUMMERS too to the chocolate treaties at the end.      Tom the waiter was very accommodating. We were a bunch of crazy, wild woman there and he treated us well. Now a hint for those who don't know about this place. It is very expensive. However, to fix that problem Wahla!l it's restaurant week in Phoenix. So for 30 bucks, plus tax and tip per person, you can share the experience with a preset menu deal.( you can purchase upgrades too)  Lovely evening. Enjoy! Bonjour!

I found this place by accident. Went to Dr's appt in the same strip mall and saw it so had to walk in. I did not know there were any indie Scrapbooking places left anymore. They have been open for about a year and a half. The things that struck me about this place were; the unique paper selection, (I loved the Rock a Bye Baby and weirdo Alice in Wonderland paper),  the fact they take Groupon, and the owner and employee are the best! I was made to feel very valued shopping here.And as we all know that doesn't happen at the (cough, cough) competition. I hate shopping for crafts nowadays because the customer service is so bad. I think I will drive out of my way to return here and maybe take a class or two.  Did I mention how nice the owner is? lol! She really is a gem. I had such a nice conversation with her and her store employee. They actually also gave me a really good idea on a project I have been mulling over in my mind and how to do it. They coincidentally had the same idea more or less and made a  very nice wall hanging. I liked their idea way better than how I was going to do it. Thanks guys!  And Yelpers check it out. It is a smaller store with a limited selection, no yarn, and they do have some pottery items too.

This is an amazing museum! It is so large though so you will get tired. Since I can't offer any other display information that the other reviewers have not already told you I will give you some advice on your visit. Wear your walking shoes. Honestly, I can't even imagine bringing kids here since I spent 7 hours and still missed things. I was beat afterwards.  I loved my visit here.I especially loved the Artist Room with John Lennon and Paul Simon on display. ( Heaven for me) The traveling Latino display with the NYC Juke box listening booths and Interactive displays were so much fun. You can remix songs and play the piano keys back to some cool songs.  i just could not get the 5th song right on the playback the tune display. I trilled those keys for like 15 minutes. I was so stubborn and finally played the right notes. After you get it right the screen tells you the name of the song. I felt like an accomplished musician after I finally go it right! -lol. I also liked the big wooden dance floor and dance video exhibit in the same room.     The negative of MIM is the expense. It is obvious you need more than one trip here to see everything and the price might inhibit that. 15 dollars. I was able to get in free since it was teacher month. However, I am sad to think I won't be able to go back since it is also a far away drive. They don't offer coupons either according to the staff and from anywhere that I have ever found.( and I am good at scoping out those types of things)     If you do get a chance to go THEN GO and RUN THERE! You will love it if you love music. if you are a teacher you have to go now since you only have one more week to take advantage of their free admission. And as the intro video pointed out.     "Without music the language of our souls would die." So true! Enjoy your visit!

Great, great, great service. Again, two more dogs were dumped at my school. I helped them find homes. Part of the whole adoption and rescue included a visit here. I wish I knew about it for my cats. It is very cheap compared to the plan I got with Petsmart. It is a five star service for sure. They do great things and even have a Feral cat program. God Bless them. Please, someone help them to open more clinics.   As much as I hate to do this since Az is just awful as far as animal welfare goes, I am knocking off a star. I am doing this as a heads up to folks who want to use the service because of a very rude staff member and a very disorganized check in procedure. Just be flexible if you chose their services. Perhaps bring another person to help you?   The place has an assembly line check in so do not expect fancy Vet customer service. You get what you pay for. In my case I was not paying. I was just helping out and dropping off the dogs. I kept telling the woman at intake this and she kept arguing with me. This proved to be very stressful for me and the dogs. I left the place extremely upset. The dogs were very scared. They had been through a lot these last two weeks.   I was especially annoyed at the way one of the intake clerks was treating me. She was snappy and rude with me. I noticed she treated a few other patrons the same way. I think the check in process is stressful, disorganized, and unclear. Maybe a sign to tell you how to do it? I had no idea what to do. When I returned the paperwork on the counter the woman literally tore my head off, threw it back at me and said, "get back in line." I was so confused. Usually one hands in paperwork at a medical clinic and then gets called back up in turn. Also, there really was not a line to get back into. Maybe they should do a ticket number thing like at the Deli?   The intake room is way too small for the volume. Lots of pets peeing, smelly, and loud barking craziness. There was nowhere to sit. I had to fill out the paperwork standing up with two dogs tugging on a leash, jumping on my legs, and hiding behind me twisting the leash around me, scared to death. The intake worker kept telling me to move away from the counter but there was nowhere else to go. Those dog's butts were not budging from their hiding area. Poor babies were very stressed out, so was I.   A few patrons were yelling at the intake workers for not having them down for their verified appointments too. I wanted to video tape the scene it was sooooooooooo crazy.  It sure was a zoo both literally and figuratively. lol. When you have scared animals it can be very aggravating. The intake worker could have been much nicer.   However, all of the other staff members were very helpful, especially the Techs. I also liked the woman who was walking around helping people. Karma dictated that she appeared after I already checked in and was on my way out.   Anyway, it is a great service for sure just be open minded. Be prepared to be a bit aggravated for your reduced cost services. I could have given them 5 stars but they need to improve their check in services. They also should educate staff surrounding sensitivity.

I was very happy with the services I received here for two procedures. I also had a surgery here this past Friday and I was very well cared for by all. I was treated with great respect and had outstanding customer service from the Nurse Anesthesiologist Justin. Justin really listened to my concerns and solved any issues that could arise from side effects. He was also very kind and friendly. He could sense I was a bit scared and was a calming soul. I had a prior bad experience with surgery Anesthesia so was very nervous. I credit Justin with almost no side effects from this round of Anesthesia. Diane in PreOp and Agnes (I think that was her name) were also very caring souls. I just adore nurses.    The one and only bit of advice I could give is that the Recovery Room stay should be longer in my opinion. I am not sure why they kick you out so fast. Wave of the times I suppose. It did not seem that busy but maybe they needed the bed. That worries me a bit since I had challenges getting home. I think it would have been better to let me stay a few more hours. They literally had me dressed and out the door in about 40 minutes after surgery. The Recovery Room nurse was a bit gruff. I really can not say anything bad about her but she is not as out-goingly caring as the Pre-Op folks. Of course if I had to choose I guess I would pick the warmer fuzzy folks first for calming effects prior to surgery rather than after. However, both are important and have purpose and reason.  Thanks to all the staff for taking such great care of me.

Absolutely incredible Hampton. Stayed here for a wedding at Ashley Manor which is nearby. Nicest Hampton I have ever stayed at.  (And I have stayed at a lot) Service was outstanding! They knew who I was as I walked in. Ok, so how do they do that? Eric at the Desk and Gloria at Breakfast are like long lost relatives. The bed was to die for. I  really wanted to take that white down comforter home with me.( Only kidding Hampton-lol) but really where can I get one for my house?  The bed was super comfy and the room is nice. Here is how I know this is a top notch place. The electricity went out while I was there because of construction on Price/101. No one seemed upset, the guests were not screaming or angry, and everyone handled it smoothly and calmly. That tells me this is a fine establishment with a reputation for good customer service. Sure enough, the lights came back on and everything was great.Gloria went around to all the tables  checking on everyone and reassuring them during and even after delivering the food that was in the toaster, waffle iron, etc. Way to go Gloria! They have a free shuttle so that's a nice added bonus for wedding guests at the Ashley Manor or super shoppers at Chandler Mall. I want to go back and have a staycation immediately. Oh BTW, the Homewood Suites in the same parking lot is gorgeous too if you need a suite hotel. Happy vacationing.

Not a lover of hot dogs unless it is a NY Sabaret I was beyond bewildered as to why I stopped here. More out of curiosity to try an AZ themed hot dog that my Foodie friends keep raving about.   It was the Friday before Vaca and I wanted to get my junk food on in a place you would never see a Cardiologist. Ha! This place is right on the way home from school so I stopped in.  Amazingly enough I actually loved the Az Hotdog. It was really good, if not good for you.   I also got an order of Carne Asada fries which I could take or leave it. These are the Nachos of the fries world. I am just not a Nacho Lover. I could not taste the fries because there was so much stuff on top of them. The fries I did taste were very bland. Maybe more salt and less sauce? Maybe they are suppose to be this way and it was user error. Oh well, either way, the hot dog was pretty darn good though so check it out.  I ate at the 46th ave location. There is more than one location. Heads up since they are a small local they do charge for credit and debit transactions. This is not uncommon for local businesses and I don't mind at all. However, just letting others know they do that.

Dant, Dant, Dant, Daaaaaaa! Tada, my 500th review! Yeah and what a fabulous review it will be. This place has been around for years and has a fascinating history. El Chorro is historic staple in Paradise Valley set around gorgeous views of Camelback and Mummy mountain. I have been wanting to go here for 30 pus years but never seem to have gotten around to it for whatever varied reasons. Once upon a time they used to close during the summer. However, now I hear it is under new management and was recently remodeled. Well, for my 500 review I picked their Happy Hour. We all had a great time at my UYE. Sorry peeps for being so early but it goes until 6pm so let's do it again sometime.   it was a small gathering but thanks friends for coming out. The Happy Hour here we have decided is the best Happy Hour in town. The food was delicious and the drinks were a great deal. 3 dollar wine and 5 dollar beers. 5 dollar food plates. We could not believe it! The final bill was very reasonable and we left totally stuffed. Okay well, I did stop at Sweet Republic on the way home but only because I was mad that I forgot to order Chorro's famous sticky buns. Sigh! Oh well, just another reason a return trip is mandated.  We sat on the patio at the community table and met some cool folks from Connecticut with Long Island roots. The weather was great and the company was superb!  Although a bit windy and hot it was cool on the patio with the misters. And seriously, that view! It can't be beat.   For food we ordered a variety of plates off their Happy Hour menu, Chicken Livers ( Not me), vegetable Crudite with Hummus, shrimp ( My favorite), SW Poutine ( I finally tried Poutine), Sliders with fries, and more chicken livers.  (Again not for me-YUK!- lol) My friends claim the chicken livers were great if you like that sort of thing. (Again not for me)   The wine and beer selection is pretty good and great price! We liked the white.   The view is spectacular.   Many return trips seen in my future.

The Zuchinni Fries are the best! The sweet potato fries are delish. The burgers are very good. I like them better then Delux. The service was delightful. The drinks sounded great but I did not indulge. They have malted drinks and fancy fun cocktails. Chocolate Sangria anyone? Pomagranite, Pineapple Cosmo, Creme Brulee milk shakes. Hello? yummers- but I am only guessing. These drinks sure sound good though.

The best burgers in town at a fast food restaurant. Cajun fries are tasty too. They have the coolest soda dispenser at this location. Hey, I never knew they had Orange and Rasberry Diet Coke.

I actually really liked this place, surprisingly enough. AZ lacks any good Chinese restaurants but this was not too bad. They have new owners and managers so maybe some of the bad reviews do not relate anymore?   The girl who works here is wonderful. I ambled in early one morning and just wanted some spicy soup because I was sick. I spent a while in the restaurant chatting with my new friend who was very helpful and knowledgeable about food.  The lunch special was cheap and pretty good. I love their homemade hot mustard. ( It is hot!)

My first race 2013. Really only my second marathon in my entire life. One was years ago when I was much younger and only for a mile. I hobbled through this one walking. We ran a short while but mostly we laughed and snapped pics along the pretty route. And such beautiful weather!!! Last year it was hot but this year was perfect!      All abilities are welcome at Pat's Run. They even have a wheelchair and kids race. Participating in this event is an honor. It is the least I can do when I think about what soldiers do daily to keep me safe. This is an outstanding race with tons of energy and fun! Lots of Freebies at the Expo before and after. Everyone is soooooo nice. Tempe Police were wonderful! I never felt safer and respected. People watching is fun. What the runners wear is so wonderful, and at times a bit odd, but I suppose that is part of the fun and tribute. I saw a man who had on a military uniform but his head was missing and replaced with a robot helmet. Very cool! I saw another man in a spandex suit. All Spandex red, white and blue. Teehee! Some fireman walked in full hazard gear. My walking partner, a fireman's daughter, said that was pretty crazy and dangerous. Everyone wants to do their small part to honor the fallen. Who everyone is walking for is inspirational to read about and hear the stories. Lots of Boston love!  Honoring Tillman is a humbling and awe inspiring event. I passed out water last year with the USO and I wanted to participate in the race this year even though I do not run. I walked the entire 4.2 miles with a broken shoe and a hole worn straight through my socks. lol!    In regards to some other comments made by other reviewers. The stroller issue has been resolved this year. I had no problems with getting water and was a water passer outer last year. I never heard of a VIP table for water as Monica said. I am not sure what that was all about but again I was at mile marker 3 with water. The fee is 45 dollars. I do not think that is very high for a charity run. Also, that fee more than pays itself with the freebies and discounts the participants get in the virtual Goodie Bag. In fact I contributed more.     I have to say the sense of community was great. Other racers were so friendly. The folks at the Expo were wonderful and generous. All in all, I was honored to participate and show some love for a true American hero.

5 stars for burgers 2 for service. Ate at 5 Guys in Orlando after hearing about it from all people, President Obama. I love me a good burger. They are delish here! They just opened in the Phx area. I love their food but the wait was horrid. Extra horrid! They also have no seating. You have to go out in the mall, which was packed.  The service wasn't that great but I do love their hamurgers! YUMMY! They do have a few other locations opening up in Downtown and North Phoenix so I will try them out. They might be less crowded.

What a fun find! I can't really add much that the other reviewers have not already said. Come by and check out the antique soda market. They own the one next door too. If you want to find a soda brand from your hometown and or your Glory Days of past, or not so Glory Days of past, they probably have it.   The turkey sub was pretty good and the staff were extra nice. Hi Ruth! Ruth even gave me a small Yelp discount which was super nice of her. She did not have to do that because I did not buy the whole combo. I will definitely be going back to this fun place to try a burger too.

Today I was heartbroken over the info that one of my favorite Italian restaurants had closed. A friend, trying to cheer me up, told me to try "Gaspers". I never heard of it. It opened last July. SOOOOOO, since I had a teacher event at the Science Center I headed out early and went. It was a nice event. I got there before they opened and the first thing Ari the hostess said was, "Oh no problem come on in." Ok, so great service right from the start. I had a nice conversation with Ari ( hostess and new Sundevil) throughout my dinner. ASU talk is always great and she told me the owners were from NY. I am always looking for a taste of home. My waiter was attentive-owhhhh did not catch his name, maybe Dave? ( I heard the owner screaming it from the kitchen- ahwhhh NY memories)   Food-  I started with the Caprese Salad, as usual. Good! I wasn't a fan of the pita bread they give you though, since it was burnt on the bottom.  I am old fashion and like the soft inside hard outside Italian bread with the dipping olive oil/vinegar.   Pizza- they did not have an Italian sausage pizza on the menu but they made me one. It is hard to find good sausage here and it is great here. Reminds me back home. The pizza was very good, not NY style, Woodbrick type which I don't like as much. However, so far this has been one of the best I have had in Phx. I don't like the bottom burnt and all the other places tend to do that. They did not burn it for me so happy me.   Although my diet cried with regrets, I ordered the Cannolis and they brought me these two huge delish, wonders. I got to take one home. They were fantastic!( hope their tiramasu is as good) The cannolis  have an orange seal or something of the other orangey in it that makes it a little more unique.   Final story-happy and stuffed me. I will be back. Hey, they have happy hour every day( Mondays closed)  for cheaper food prices and bar specials. Wanna go? LOL! MANGA!

OK, so this is how much I love this product. I first tasted Lee's at a Yelp Elite event and waited and dreamed a whole year to eat it again. When I was invited to the next year's Elite Pleydate it was the topic of the first question out of my mouth. "Is Lee's gonna be there?" ( Ok, maybe the whole French restaurant's Bone Marrow gravy came to mind too, but I digress) When I made it inside to Pleydate I literally ran to that booth having desert before dinner. I am all about the alcohol infused ice cream now. The funny thing about that is I am not even a big ice cream lover. I will have to visit the shop soon.

The food is wonderful. The service was a bit lacking. The server was nice but not as attentive as he should have been for a non busy evening. We ordered the Gazpacho, Monk Fish, Beef Tapas and Pappas Aioli. All of the tapas dishes were delicious! I even liked the fish which humored my friend since I usually hate all fish dishes. When I was in Spain I became a little addicted to Cafe Con Leche and it is good here. The Churos were a bit different, not authentic,  but tasty. When I asked if they served them with chocolate I was expecting the way they serve them in Spain. Did not happen but I still enjoyed them. In fact all the deserts here sound awesome. I will have to go back and try all of them. The first being the stuffed apple delight. This place is expensive though.

I have never liked Macaroons. I never got all the hype. The cream was fine but the outside I found gross! I found them gummy and chewy with a weird texture. As I was telling my french friend this today he just looked at me aghast and said, "What are you talking about Mary? They are not gummy or chewy at all. The creme?" No I explained to him I liked the filling but the cookie pastry part was just too chewy. He continued to look at me like I was nuts.    "The pastry is suppose to be flaky and moist and puffy/airy but Americans make them different." he kindly explained.  So now it was my turn to look at him like he was nuts. "Go to NB. They are french, Macaroons are good there, and I am a picky Frenchman." Okay, so how do you turn down an invitation like that? lol   So on the way home I did. I stopped by and bought two. A coconut one and a chocolate. The kind lady threw in a free Hazelnut sample. Well, now I understand all the hype. WOW, is all I can say. I added a torte cake that will be demolished tonight and I can't wait until their new chef starts making food. ( soon she said)-- Merci!

The food is outstanding and the service is wonderful. A bit crowded but not sure if that is typical of the establishment or because it is Az Restaurant Week. We used a Groupon so it was dead cheap. The regular prices are pretty reasonable too. The restaurant is pretty. The only draw back is there is nowhere to wait. On the way out the door we had to fight to leave because the folks waiting were blocking the exit. With this place (and my other favorite, Gallo Blanco) I could learn to like Mexican food!

Amazing! The bread is delish. Hard to find good bread in Az. The chicken salad hoagie I had was very good. The second best I have had in Phx and that is saying a lot. The desserts are amazing. I met a wonderfully nice customer while in line and we chatted like old friends. (Can I tell you how much I love my new neighborhood.  I can actually talk with my neighbors and not hide from them-ha) The owner came out and joined in the conversation. That was cool. There is one lady who works behind the counter that is not very outgoing and seemed annoyed when people ordered things. That seemed weird but I think that is just her way, The other gal is very personable. This is a great place to have a sandwich and some treats. By the way, their coffee is very good here too, if you just want a good, plain cup of Joe.

Gorgeous theater lobby almost like a Broadway theater. I had my own personal screening for Railway Man last night. No one was there but me. That was awesome. (great Flic by the way) I had a free ticket from a Gatsby costume contest last year so that helped. This place is very nice but hilatiously expensive. A night out here will cost you dearly between Valet, ticket price, and 15 dollar soda and dessert. I can not imagine if you ate here. That must be close to a sixty dollar evening.  So while this is very nice, it is an only once in a while treat. The theater itself is very swanky. You get a blanket, pillow and lounger chairs.( do not fall asleep lol) Oh yeah, and this might be an odd comment, but I find the bathrooms here breathtaking. lol-They are so, so nice.  See I still have a little girly, girl and Ny finery left in me.

I always have to check out a place when a lot of New Yorkers recommend it. The staff here are ever so nice. When I walked in there were a table of firefighters eating a big pie.  I knew it had to be good. Those guys know good food for sure. lol- If you like NY pizza then you will like it here. It was very good. Probably so far the best I have had on the West Side of town. I also think their Zannoli is, "Oh so clever" and "Oh so delish!" Hard to find Zeppoles out here anyway and the combination Zeppoles and Cannoli was fun and great. [ but not for my diet. :0( ]

So there is only one thing that stops me from being a Vegan- Wait for it, Yelp, you guessed it- hamburgers. Ok, maybe not just one thing but burgers are certainly high up there on the list. Love me a good burger. Sorry cows. Yes I do love animals but my willpower fails me when it comes to a great juicy meat patty. But I digress. In regards to INOB Frankly, everyone raves about this place and I never got it. There are so many better hamburgers in town.  All the times I went here did not leave a memorable impression in my brain, good or bad. sooooooooo, when I saw they opened one more centrally located I decided to go again with the soul purpose of writing a review. (Hmmmm that's a switch for foodie Mary here who usually only goes to eat first and write second)     INOB is known for using real meat and not processed patty garbage- so give them a check on the positive. ( And they might be one of the few fast food restaurants that uses real food) In N Out is know for their wonderful hiring procedures and employee and employer relations. (gotta love that in today's day and age) - another check- INOB burgers cost under 5 bucks and a little bit over for a combo- WOWZA checkmate! (Mary does not like paying 10- 15 dollars for a good hamburger. She will, haha, but doesn't like to)     Ok, so now onto the negative-( Sigh, I know but I have to share)  Crazy busy places make me nervous and messes up the shopping center parking lot when I need to got to Michael's- check minus for almost getting hit five times getting there today.  French Fries-ewhhhhh! Why were they cold if they serve them fresh? I know I am very picky about temperature and fries.I don't eat fries to much anymore so I want them to be really good when I indulge because I hate to throw them out and waste food and money. They just aren't that good here- check minus.     And now onto the golden reason I liked today's visit the best----- It was the customer service!( big roar in the background inserted here)  Jeepers Kreepers INOB staff members can ya keep the smileage down please? Do you have to be so nice? LOL! I swear they send the staff to happy, friendly, excellent customer service college. They are all very nice and give service with a smile. Eye contact and everything. (Makes the longer wait a little but more manageable)  It is amazing how they beat out the others by a mile in this dept. Even better than some fancy restaurants.     So in conclusion, is INOB the best burger in town- no far from it. Is it good- yes. Is it the best burger for fast food under 15 bucks -HMMMMMMM, well you decide. I'll never tell. But to tell you my secret It is in my two top favorites. You will have to guess which one I like more. I do admit my favorite though comes nowhere close in the Customer Service dept and the Phoenix locations can't match the back east versions. So with that said many of my Westerner Peeps might end up picking INOB as their first choice. So, enjoy and be happy there is finally one more centrally located. And from the line out the door I think it is about time.   PS- you might want to tell them to hold the onions though. Wehhhh 6 hours later and my breath is still reliving the experience.

Jersey Mike's is probably the closest you will get in AZ to a hero from back east. We just do not have good bread or deli sandwiches/heroes here. It used to be at Hero Hut in downtown Phoenix but they went out of business this year. Besides Cassella's in Scottsdale this is the best I have found so far living here for 30 plus years.

Fox restaurant has service down to a T, well in this case an S I suppose. An S with a big capitol letter used for great "service." I felt pretty spoiled. I have never had bad service at any of their restaurants and yesterday was no exception at my first AB visit. Kelly and team were wonderful and made us feel super spoiled.   The food was great. I had the pretzel bun Turkey Pastrami sandwich, which was Delish. The shrimp and pretzel apps are wonderful but the Carmel pudding was, "lick the glass jar clean, to die for."   AB is a pretty restaurant, unique decor.    The only draw back is the price. I always find it so pricey/ costly to eat at a Fox place. However, they do have Happy Hour. Will have to go back for some more of those yummy pretzels.

I found their pizza to be pretty bad. It was ice cold and flavorless. Why was it cold? It did not sit that long from what we saw since we were sitting at the bar right next to the serving window. We dived in right away Hmmmmmmmmm.   The man behind the bar was pretty cool and nice though. The hostess was not friendly and ignored us at first. The place gets busy at Westgate so maybe it was an off night.   Why the heck is a pizza 20 bucks? Chris Bianco does not even charge that much.

The bad thing about this place is that it certainly doesn't fit in with my new plant based eating plan. I did have a Greek salad though. LOL However, I think the Muffaletta Bread App and pizza ( that has a crust, by the way, more like a baked pretzel than a pizza) kind of killed it. I did have small servings though. :0)----- I had a great meal with great company and great service! ( thanks Kevin and cute guy with the pony tail) We did a 50 /50 pizza split with a potato mixed pizza and a Greek style. Sorry I forget the names. The pizza was very different and very delish! The subs look fantastic here too. The restaurant is very cool and hip. Lots of room to chat and relax. We went early at 3pm on a Saturday so no crowds at all. Enjoy it!

This place needs to not be such a secret. I have been looking for a place like this since Glendale closed down many of their shops and after coming back from Lake Mary Fl where the entire town has these little delightful specialty stores. What a wonderful adventure in the Secret Village's 6 little specialty shops. Think Coomers meets Jootenhoops. I loved their Mark Roberts collection and their unique teacher gifts. The staff here were incredible. Another reason to shop here, "Buy Local". Their 6 shops are themed for Cooking/kitchen, kids, pets, man cave, and collectibles. They also do a once a month vendor sale. Amazingly, they do not charge the vendors to participate either. This place needs to expand. Thank you to the lovely folks I talked to today and my new found holiday treasures.

Cute place, delish treats. They even have old school candy. "Oh My, Razzles." We were just talking about them and how we could not find them anywhere. I love their Salted Caramels, yum. I also had a scoop of pretty darn good coconut ice cream. I love this darling little shop. By the way, the girl who works there is delightful. The only negative is that a lady came in with a Non- Service dog. That is a big no no for me.

The servers at this location are wonderful. The burgers are on the better end of the fast food chain and I love their Rosemary Sweet Potato fries. Yummy! Check it out.

Greasy hole in the wall joint. I gave it one star but please read the review. OK the food I had was very good. (Bordering on delish actually) but keep reading. This is a strange place. Superhero decor all over the place and Spiderman was playing on the wall Plamsa TV. It was too dark to see the movie though. ( Don't know why, maybe the TV was broke or the light from the nearby window was too much, hmmmmmm) ) I got a regular burger special. It was yummers. Good fries!  They have different types of burgers, breakfast 24 hours a day, and Gyros.They also have all types of deep fried desert treats too. But herein lies the problem. I wasn't even half way finished eating when I literally was attacked by flies. Lots of them! They were all over the area I was sitting at. They kept landing in my food, on my face , in my hair, etc and so forth. I was like, "What The Heck?"  I looked around and noticed that the place was pretty filfthy and swarming with even more flies. It was pretty disgusting! I left. Too bad because I really liked the food. I wanted to come back and try some other things, but I won't. It only takes one case of previous food poisoning to become very paranoid about things like that. I am not even the world's pickiest neat freak but I don't know what was going on in there tonight.  So my questions for Mike are, "why all the flies and why such a dirty restaurant?" EWHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! It was like some really bad 1960 Hitchcock movie. ( NO JOKE)  This place is closed as of 4/15/13

This was not a good experience. The only reason I am giving it two stars is for two reasons. One is for the delightful folks we met at the restaurant in order to not get kicked off of our table for 6. ( Yes, kicked off a table- Sheesh!) They were awesome folks though. Two, the woman who took our order was very nice.   The restaurant is built with no rhyme, reason or sense. If it was not crowded enough they crowded even more tables into an already cramped space. They put the coffee counter in the worse strategically placed area in the entire restaurant. I got knocked over twice when I tried to refill my coffee. The restaurant itself is cut throat to get a seat and packed with angry, rude customers and staff who ask you if you are done yet. (Really? When I go out I do not want people rushing me and making me rush off my table. How rude) When we finally got a table we literally got told me could not sit there and had to move because it was reserved for 6 or more people. WHAT??? I have never seen this in a restaurant before. The waitress kept telling us we had to move. Finally, I was so pissed after she told us to go outside in 120 degree heat we went and got people who were waiting and invited them to sit down with us. We made a party table. The waitress was not happy with us. Oh well, the feeling was mutual. The staff find it impossible to work here. They can not deliver the food or service the self serve coffee counter due to space limitations and crowds of people waiting to fight it out for a table. I had the sad misfortune to time my empty coffee cup with the staff members attempt to deliver a new urn of coffee. With that and other customers visiting the counter for napkins and such, it makes it a literally impossible and maddening task. The waitress trying to replace the urn was very rude and snappy with me. She about ripped my head off. Sorry, I am in your way lady. I am a paying customer actually trying to get some of your coffee. They really need to change the entire layout of how they do things here. I can't believe no one has ever gotten hurt or burnt eating at Ncounter. To make matters worse there is a table like two inches away from the counter. God forbid one sits at that table.   So, "what about the food?" Hmmmmmm, I found the food not good at all. The coffee was not exceptionally yummy and was way too hot. I got the Banana's Foster and it was Blahhhh. It tasted weird and made me feel sick afterwards. It had some weird sauce on top of it that did not taste right and was strange to the touch. Also, part of our order was not delivered and we had to drive back to get it. My meal was also not hot enough.   On the fair side, my friend had the ham sandwich dish that has a french name to it. I tasted it and it was okay but not good enough for the price. The brownie cookie we had was good too. It wasn't the best I have ever had but good. Their other bakery items looked promising, except maybe the bagel, which looked gross.   The entire experience was so aggravating I would not go back unless it was winter for patio seating, and or off hours, ( But what are their off hours here? This is the second time I have been here and it was too crowded to get service) It seems taking things Togo here might be the way to go. However, then they would need to change the name of the restaurant wouldn't they?

I love Firehouse Subs. I am extremely glad that they are finally in the Phoenix area after discovering them back east several years ago. I always get the Chicken Salad sub but have heard great things about all their sandwiches. I hear their Meatball Sub is the best. I also like that they help non profit's and give back monetary donations to the community. Gotta love that!

Annette, cookies, and several European cool sounding herbal/Ice teas tucked into a cute lil Down Town Glendale shop and what more needs to be said. I love the salted/caramel cookies the best, although they are all Delish! Just a heads up, this is really not a full service or large bakery. Don't go in thinking they have a lot. They only sell about 6 types of cookies but they are fantastic. YUMMY!

I don't get the hype associated with Chris but I digress. ( I love the sandwiches at Panne though)  My dinner partner is Italian and what she ordered she said was very good. I myself did not think mine was to die for. I must be jinxed and order the wrong thing every time I eat at one of Chris' restaurant. I have to admit though his hand pressed mozzarella, tomatoes and Italian sausage are high quality for AZ standards. Maybe I can just eat apps here. lol     The service was fine, nothing to write home about but not bad either. The restaurant is small. I felt squished. However, I have heard they are expanding. I have also heard they are adding pizza and Pannes to the menu! Woot, woot! Well, I guess I will keep trying Chris. I am determined to get a good pizza from you at least one time. We are not done with each other yet. lol!     Good luck on the new venture. I like the open kitchen and changing menu concept too. Four stars and a return trip guaranteed because you are better than most so called Italian places in sadly lacking Az. Also,if my picky, NY, Italian, makes pasta and gravy from scratch friend VK likes you, there has to be something there that I am missing.

As a Fine Arts person this was an once in a lifetime opportunity. I don't know what to say but Grazie'. The above reviews said it all. To be an observer to opera singers and to hear a Maestro give vocal and language advice was an ELL, Gifted, Drama teacher's dream. It was so fascinating! I really missed NY while listening in to the Maestro's NY accent as he gave advice. He was very charming and witty. He obliged me by staying a little later and answering a few questions I had after the rehearsal.  (very nice) The singers were so entertaining and gracious as well. And there were even a few laughs during the evening.Hahaha to the clever piano player who played the, "Jeopardy Theme Song" as a joke when the Maestro's cell went off-lol!     I so wish I could sing one-one millionth well as the singers that were there. It was amazing to listen to them and wonder where did that voice come from?This was a very different/unique event for Yelp. I had a million thoughts running through my mind all evening. That's what good music and the theater does to my brain though. BTW, The food from the food carts was sooooo good too.Thank you so much to everyone involved. As usual I love and am thankful for being a Yelper !

A very unique place. I had tried their yummy BBQ at the Elite yearly event at Ft. McDowell and I heard other Elites raving about the newer event they sponsored there in September 2013. So when on the way to Westworld and I noticed I needed gas, coincidentally this is the place we ended up.   The place is a boutique, coffee bar, restaurant, convenient store, and gas station all in one. Sounds strange huh? It is, but wonderful. Got gas on the way to Westworld last night and then tried to stop on the way back for eats and browsing but they were already closed.  The staff let us in anyway to use the bathroom even though they were closed. We were very grateful for that. It was a long drive home. lol-- On the way out the door we were delighted to chat for a few minutes with some of the staff and they were beyond gracious and wonderful. The items I saw were darling and the coffee bar items looked fantastic.   Thank you for your kind help Tom Thumb. How about a store on the west side?

This is a great museum. My tips- do not listen to the staff who say it takes two hours to go through it. Plan on 4 hours. I was there for 3 hours and I did not have enough time to see everything. Also, they give a teacher discount. In some way there is irony in that connection but I will take it if I can get it.-- lol   Parking is five dollars so heads up if you do not carry cash.   As far as the museum goes, you can read the other reviews or go online for the content. As you have probably guessed by now it's all original Mob and G-Men artifacts.   Mary's top coolest things about the Mob Museum:  *It is housed in an Historic courthouse and Federal building from the 1930's. I love old buildings. How funny that a federal courthouse is now a Mob museum. The Irony was not lost on me.   *They actually have the wall here that the victims of the St. Valentine's Massacre were lined up against and gunned down. The real wall with the bullet holes in it and everything. Super creepy. I have some photos I will have to attach.   * The line up closet, the barber chair, the fake machine gun, and electric chair. (Even the lights dimmed when you flick the switch---lol)   * The Kennedy Room  *The history Of Las Vegas. It was all so interesting.   Negatives, *I had to leave early to catch a show and missed some stuff. Wahhh! * Parking fees in Vegas. Really?

OK, UUUUMMMMM Hello? I laugh when people think Sprinkles is good-yuk. I love Fairy Tale Brownies and other bakeries around town. However, then--- hello----- I died and went to heaven at Yelp Pleydate. These cupcakes are so crazy delicious! The best ones I have ever had! They do not have a store, sorry guys. They say they do catering only. I want to find their costumer list and stalk a wedding or something, like right out of Seinfeld or Friends.  "Yeah sure. Of course I know the bride. We went to Kindergarten together. Now leave me alone I am eating the cupcakes."  My advice to them, please open up a store and do it now! The White Russian one was the best but Shhhhhhhhh! I tried a lot of them that night and they were all fantastic!

A fantastic remodeled setting/space. Owhhhhh, I love old buildings. Being from back east it makes me sad that we have so few or rip down the ones we have. However, not here. The minute I walked into the inside living room I caught that old building smell and knew I found a new best friend.   On the way out I stopped to ask about the history of this cool space and met the owner, Christian. He proceeded on giving me a small walking tour and a great history lesson. We stood outside and chatted for a while. What a delight! How often does that happen when you frequent a business in Phoenix? I wish I lived back in this neighborhood. I can see myself curling up with a fancy flavored Latte, a book and hanging out here all day.

An amazing place! It is like being invited to a British friend's house for dining/tea or coffee. I can't add anything that everyone else has not already said. Everything was terrific but I especially liked the Breakfast Cookie. The service was truly special. The first timer free chocolate was a great touch. I will be back often. If you need Great Britain imports check them out.

This is an intriguing place for sure. The concoctions of burgers here seem very odd when you read the menu of ten or so speciality bizzaro burger mixes. I mean a PBandJ hamburger with bacon and hot sauce? ( they insist it is great!)  A Mac and Cheese hamburger? Ha! However, our burger was pretty delish! We got the Ghost burger which has Ghost Pepper Jack Cheese on it. Pretty spicy but not burn your face off either. Not sure how a whole one would fare since the last bite of a half had my mouth pretty fiery. The serving was large enough for two people to share, which we did. The Onion Rings which came with it at an extra charge were only fair so maybe stick with the fries.   The server was pretty cool, funny and talented. The place was packed. We were a large group of over ten taking up a lot of space. He handled it all pretty well and was gracious. I would go back to try some of their other unique burgers.

Went for happy hour and it was wonderful. The Rosemary Fries and Shistake Pepper small plates were delish! The drink menu is amazing. The restaurant itself is very pretty, hip, eclectic, and clean. The bartenders make you feel at home. Did not eat dinner here but it looked great. The negative is that this place is pricey.

I love this place and the servers are the best in town. I can not recommend anything to eat because everything on the menu is delish! (And I am not a big fan of Mexican food) I will say their Empenadas are my favorite though.

It's "Froyo" self serve with fresh ingredients and toppings all served in a place with very quirky, strange Reto decor and a 1950's Mini TV. -Life is good! Nuff said.

Oh my goodness gracious and all that is foodie heaven. I have been wanting to go here for a long time but I had heard the line is out the door on the weekends and at lunch time. Well, today I had a few appointments nearby and with the urging of the folks in my Dr.'s office I forced the issue and decided to stop in. I am so glad that I did. It was before the lunch rush and not crowded at all. I am not usually a lover of breakfast but this place is wonderful. I enjoyed a peaceful morning. I would come here every day if I could. The food and service were outstanding. I had the most delightful conversation with the manager or owner ( Not sure which) He was absolutely wonderful to me. We talked shop for a long time while he worked the restaurant before it got too busy.   For food I ordered the Banana Bread Pudding French Toast and I actually made a "squeekie" noise after taking the first bite. lol.  Okay after every bite, but who's counting. This dish was so delish I scraped the plate clean. I never finish a breakfast plate. I ordered the sausage option and they were good. I had just a regular coffee so I can't comment on the fancier drinks. I can't wait to come back and try all their other dishes. Yum, yum, yum and thank you for taking such good care of me today. I needed that.

2nd time in today. I adore this place. The service is great and the food is wonderful. A bit more crowded then the last time but no worries. I stayed a while and was not rushed out. I will have to try something other than their to die for "Pain Purdue" though the next time I come in. The owner/manager, and other patrons it seems, suggest "The Pocket." So next time it is a pocket for me.  Vovomeena has great sausages too. Some of the best I have had in AZ. In a city that thinks "Matt's Big Breakfast and Denny's are Foodie Heavens ( Why?) I am happy to find Vovomeena. Drawback- it is pricey but I do not have to eat again all day after eating here. lol

Incredible meal and incredible service. Thank you Collin! The Truffle Mac and Cheese and Veggie Bread pudding were out of this world. The Brie Cheesecake was unexpected too. Smooth and creamy not Brie tasting at all. Everything was excellent! Such a fine surprise find. We meant to go to another place across the street but they had a very long wait so found Rusconi's instead.  A find for sure. I just wish we lived closer.   Of course servers should check on their guests and ask them how they are doing. We did not find the service overbearing at all. In fact it was perfect! I served for many years and everything was great! Our conversation was never interrupted.

I am sad to say expanding on a great thing is not always a great thing. We have eaten at the original Hilton Village location for years when that was all there was. It was great NY style pizza, cheap prices, especially on wine, and very friendly service. Recently they have expanded to, I believe maybe 5 restaurants now? They changed the menu too. I feel they should have stuck with what they knew. The one location or maybe two  and put in the effort with those.   We ate here at the 83rd Ave location this evening and to be honest it was not the best  experience.   The good- the fries and asparagus apps were tasty. They were gracious about splitting the check the way we wanted, and my friends say the pizzas were good. I tried the crust which was good but not great.  The bad- The service was just terrible. So much so that we were actually getting angry. The hostess was rude and acted like she did not want our business. Our server was nice, but not around. Our birthday gal pal was left without her meal a good five minutes after we got ours. I think she might have waited longer if I did not flag down another staff member and ask them to check. And finally, what is their Caprese Salad all about? The Mozzarella cheese was the consistency of cottage cheese, which I did not care for at all, the basil/pesto sauce was very bland, and who makes Caprese with cherry tomatoes? You can not cut it or layer it. It was very odd to say the least. And the price of a Caprese salad for what you get is very expensive. I have never paid that much for a salad that small and unflavorful and I have eaten Caprese in tons of restaurants before.   Finally, the last straw came when gave my friend a small styrofoam box to try to fit her leftovers in. Pizza places should know their business enough that you can not take leftovers in this type of container unless you have one small slice. You should know how to wrap pizza to go if pizza is your business expertise. Very frustrating all around.

The food is delicious, the service was grand and very attentive, and the decor is delightful. It really is a pretty restaurant. They have the best Churros with Carmel dipping sauce. I ate a lot of them in Spain and it is hard to find good ones here. A suggestion would be to offer a deep dipping chocolate option too.   I read the two bad reviews and have no idea what that is all about. They were all over us with great service and the only other restaurant with as good street tacos and such is Gallo Blanco. I did not try the chips or Guacamole. I might have to go back if it is as good as others say.

Been here two other times now.  The food and service here is very good. I even gave a Spanish lesson to a server. lol--- The chef is from Mexico City so no Tex Mex here. Great happy hour place with my Girlies. Rasberry Habenero Margarita for 5 bucks, Yum!  Seven dollar plates. Yippee! This is my second favorite Mexican restaurant in town. The Guac is good, yes but still not as good as Gallo/Otro. I will have to go here more often especially since they are right next door to an "Anything Bundt Cakes."

I thought this place was super cute and fun. We were in and out pretty fast for a Pre Gammage meal and Yelp Elite Event. I had the burger and my friend had the fish and chips. Amazingly enough ( who knew) the fish is really delish! ( Like that rhyme? ) Very good for AZ. The chips were just regular French Fries not really chips and not that great. They might consider chip style fries. My burger was pretty good. The pretzels are wonderful. They rival, "Culinary Dropout's The Yard" and that is saying a lot. The service was fantastic! I would definitely go back.

I just had a wonderful experience here so 5 stars it is. If George Foreman owned a eatery it would be Zooks. Lol- they make their sandwiches in a machine that transfers your meal into a pocket type of sandwich melt kind of like the grills Foreman makes. See, so I made that fun connection. However, the difference is the owner Carole is a gem. (Okay, maybe George is too but I don't know him personally or have ever met him before - Call me George Foreman the next time you are in Phx and Zooks is on me.- lol, silly me.)   After I walked in looking a little lost, a woman comes running over to me with a big grin on her face. She was so welcoming and explains the entire sandwich making process to me. I had no idea what to order so we began to chat. "Wow, the staff here are so helpful and nice," I am thinking to myself. ( especially after I tell her I meant to go to another restaurant and found my way here by mistake. Well not really since Zooks was on the "Gotta Try List" anyway. I believe Karma led me here today ) Well, as it turns out this charming lady is to my great surprise the actual owner, Carole. She is so delightful, helpful and friendly. It is apparent Carole loves what she does and is proud of her place.   The breakfast sandwich I received was pretty tasty. They use Wildflower bread, Ummm, "Yummers!" I can't wait to come back and try all of the different menu item sandwiches. I read all these great comments on the Kale salad so I will have to try that too.   The only thing you might want to note is that the sandwiches are smaller than the average way too big portions we seem to be familiar with in America. I was thrilled myself. However, some other people who do not know any better might be forewarned.   Thank you Carole and the pleasure was all mine to meet you. Just a note, I never made it to the other restaurant at all. I might never with you nearby.

Outstandingly ( Is that a word?) fantastic staff, ( Howdy Phillip and gang), great cupcakes, best peach Ice Tea Eva, and from what I hear the Sangria is to die for. (I was done drinking for the night) I went to a Yelp Elite Event and part of our tour was a stop here. I have been wanting to hit their QC Grove location for a while now. I will definitely have to do that. The shop part has the strangest, wonderful, and most delightful olives, oils, and beauty products. Chocolate or Bacon Olive Oil anyone? lol

Not usually a fan of shaved ice even when I was in HI. Everyone told me to get an ice and I was like, "Okay, whatever." I tried them on the beach and could not figure out what the big deal was. It was just an icey. However, I have heard so much about this place that I have been wanting to try it. As I was in the hood I zoomed in. Tricky to find so look for the Subway/Starbucks Mall and watch construction please.   These treats are even better than anything I had in the islands. They mix the ice with ice cream and condensed cream on top. It sounds odd but it is really, really delicious. I had a half coconut half Mai Tia/Ice Cream in the middle and snow capped. ( condensed cream) So, so ,so, so good! I was actually shocked how much I liked it. I am dying to go back and try the bowls they have with the granola and fruit.   I can not believe I am giving an ice place five stars but I really loved it. I loved the island stories from the owner. I read the other comments about him. Yes he takes a bit to warm up but stick with it. He razzed me about my accent and island lingo pronunciation for sure but by the end of the visit I was charmed and listening to his whole life story. I love island story telling and the Aloha spirit. He is also an ex Marine so I can respect that.   Anyway, check it out, good stuff. I had a medium at 3 bucks so pretty cheap treat. Plus, it made a national best ice cream list. Gotta love that.

I have had these at various times at Yelp Elite events and they really are the best. I was very impressed at work this week when I found six boxes in the teachers lounge. They donated them for the teachers at my school. Along with that, they gave each of us a free Bundlette coupon. I was pretty floored by their generosity since I know they are not inexpensive cakes. I stopped by today to thank them and cash in my Bundlett coupon. The service I received by the delightful ladies was beyond amazing. I was very touched by the kind comments the manager made to me in regards to teachers. Gotta love Nothing Bundt Cakes for sure.

The ole usual stopoff place to Vegas. I might have to reconsider a new one. Today on the way home I stopped elsewhere. Saturday Morning 6/23/13 I stopped here on the way to Vegas. They remodeled the entrance and the parking lot. One person wrote that it has more parking. Hmmm, to me it seems like they have less now but either way it is not an improvement outside or inside. I walk in and the bathroom is closed (really?) I used the Men's room. A line of women followed me in as the manager begrudgingly stood guard. Who cares. Most places have Coed bathrooms nowadays anyway and I have 5 brothers. lol-- However, a lot of elderly ladies stop here and Mom's with babes. They might not be so happy. No one could even say how long the bathrooms would be closed for.     After the bathroom fiasco, I ordered. The worker was very young and very unknowledgeable over basic things. Finally, the place was so dirty. I was appalled at how disgusting everything was. Ewhhhh! You would think they would keep it nicer since it is such a busy place for Roadtrippper Stopovers.

I totally agree with some of the other reviews. I just do not get it. The food is not good and the service is terrible. They do have good bread but it is Wildflower Bread. I can go there for better food. I guess the whole buy local thing is important but the food is just not that good. I have had better at Denny's. And that is sure saying a lot. I do admit Their Egg Salad sandwich for lunch is not too bad but again nothing to write home about.

If I can move my fingers fast enough to write in my over stuffed, overfed, eye drooping food coma but happy body, right now I would like to write this review. lol----The only Mexican Restaurant I can say I truly love is Gallo Blanco. I was excited to hear about this cafe from the same folks/chef but with an organic twist. I visited tonight and they were busy. Not so much when I first got there around 6:30ish but it soon started getting packed. I was greeted quickly and had to wait less than 5 minutes for a table. I chose to sit outside. if you like Gallo you will like it here. Maybe more so since I think the hotel location is just bizzare in the form of mood and atmosphere. (Unless you visit the rooftop pool first-lol) At Otro there is a type of a cool, hip, Chelsea /Greenwich Village  arty, beatnik, type of feel to it. The menu seemed the same but the hostess assured me it is not. (More organic options which has been the chef's dream for the past ten years) Oh well! That all sounds good and dandy to me but I always order the same thing because I love their Carne Asada Tortas and Guac so much! ( I swear one day I have to branch out and try some of their other food items) I usually end up taking half home and tonight was no exception.    I liked the fruity Ice tea, the hot green salsa ( Not so much the smokey, red one. I do not like smokey tasting anything) and yes I ordered my usual for dinner. I had to knock off a star because the bread was slightly burnt on my Torta ( that is a big no-no for me)  and the Guac seemed bland for some reason. Maybe the recipe is different here? With that said, their Guac is still soooooo yummers and I devoured half the Torta anyway. I never said a word nor sent it back so a solid 4 stars it is. However, I am guessing 5 stars on the next visit. Maybe my taste buds were off or something on the Guac but I did not get that citrus bite I love. For some reason I just wanted to keep reaching for a salt shaker.     I have to give 5 stars to the Coconut Pudding though. It was a small piece of heaven. I have been trying to make a good coconut creme cake filling at home but it is never correct. It is either yuk; too fake tasting or too sweet, This pudding is to die for. Not too sweet, smooth as silk, delish in a cup sprinkled with dark chocolate shavings. I died and went to Hawaii.     Michael was my server but the entire staff, more or less, all chipped in and helped. Michael is a nice man and treated me well. Micheal knows what Haupia is so he gets an extra shout out. I have to admit though he was a little too busy at times. It seems other Yelpers agree maybe they need more help here?     Thank you Otro for a nice meal. Perhaps, I should be upset that you totally helped me to ruin my diet plan. Welllll, sadly, it took very little arm twisting. Until next time, "Tiene una buen noche."

Went in a second time and actually tried something different. I had the Guac (of course) and an, Al Pastor Taco. I always eat too much when I go here or Gallo so I just got the one taco. It was delicious and I am not usually a fan of pork. I then had to get the Coconut Pudding, which like my previous review noted, is outstanding. Funny thing is I still left stuffed.   I also enjoyed the service. The waitress and I shared a history lesson and the background behind Al Pastor. Hmmm, Shawarma, who knew?  Thanks to Smart Phones everything called, "info" is at the touch of a button. lol   I really think this is the best Mexican Restaurant in the valley. Note, I said Mexican, not what Americans think Mexican is.

What a treat this place is! The Chip/Rasberry lemon curd pancake was delish. I am sorry I did not get the waitresses name but she was a joy. She had red hair and a sunshine smile though. She gave outstanding service. She did not kick me out either when I got to the part of my book that I just could not put down. I am sure I overstayed my welcome. First world reader problems. lol. In fact everyone who stopped by my table was delightful.  If I lived nearby I honestly would be here every day.   I know this is random but it touched a nice memory. I laughed out loud and smiled so big when I saw that they have fried Bologna sandwiches on the menu. What a flash from my past, growing up in NY,  grandpa-litte girl spending time together memory there. Not sure I would order it as an adult nowadays though despite the waitress saying it is great and popular. Maybe one day when I am feeling especially nostalgia i will come by and try one.   Thanks for a nice meal and great service OBH!

Delicious and darling place. It helps being the only one in the restaurant on a Monday at 2:30pm. Spoiled! The candied Yams are to die for! The service was tremendous.I really want to try all the innovative foods they offer.   The place is pricey. Thank God for a Gift Certificate.  I had a chicken salad sandwich with home made chips. I had to take half home.

The meatball sub is the best I have had in Az so far. The service was outstanding. I sat at the bar and talked with the owner. My server was the best! I can't wait to go back. I hope they do well at this location.

When my friend invited me to the Hale theater I asked her if she wanted to indulge in some light bites before the show and she agreed. Not sure what was over there since I live clear over on the other side of town I told her to pick. Amongst the list of fantastic new eateries right at the theater was Joyride.   Not the biggest fan of Tex- Mex food it takes a lot to get me to want to try Mexican. I have only about three favorites and constant Mexican eateries I will go to in town and they are more of a traditional Mexican. With that said, I had heard how great this place was so I wanted to give it a try. The verdict? Thumbs up! They have a great Happy Hour, good Guac, and tasty street tacos. ( And cheap!) My Raspberry Ancho Marg drink was tasty and again, cheap!   The place was packed though. On the way out and I got spilled on twice. Pretty tight quarters for sure if you sit inside. I guess that is part of the fun. I had a shoe that smelled like beer all evening. Oh yeah, the servers were all very nice. The food was delivered fast with a group concept. I like group concept restaurants. I'd go back. However, maybe  to the phoenix location closer to my hood.

What a fantastic dining experience from the very first impression to the last. The entire experience was just terrific. I had called earlier in the day to get directions and parking information. The woman on the phone was just so wonderful and friendly. I was happy that my first impression was starting out just great. From the moment we walked in we were made to feel like family.  As an Italian restaurant should and is usually so good at. (Hint, hint to other vendors in town) The pizza here is totally, radically delish and I am very picky about Pizza. Pomo's is one of only two places in town to be certified in the making of authentic Italian style Napoletana pizza. Even with the burnt crust, which I am never a fan of, the pizza was still wonderful.      We also ordered the Flatbread App ( Loaded with garlic and the size of a pizza, so heads up) and the Caprese Salad ( Delish). For dessert we ordered The Tiramisu, and the Creme Puffs with Mousse. The Creme Puffs were light and airy and yummy.  The Tiramisu was one of the best two I have ever had. I have eaten a lot in my life since it is my favorite dessert.      Now the impressive part to make me homesick.  As we were sitting and digesting our carb load and contemplating a roll out to my car one of the owners came to our table to say hi. Besides being an extremely handsome Italian, friendly, and chatty he had a bottle of Limoncello in his hands. My version of the perfect man. Hello, but I digress. He served us complimentary shots of their version of Limoncello.  It has an Icee creamy texture to it. It took me a minute and a few tries but in the end I decided I liked it very much despite the unusual texture for this drink. It was very inventive and I love food inventions/experimentation. I believe he said he adds heavy cream and some other ingredient to it to make it thicker. He also gave us a sample of deep friend dough strips with powered sugar. it was kind of like a Zeppole but flatter and harder. The owner walked the floor chatting with his guests making them feel at home. Now that is the type of Italian restaurant I remember from the old neighborhood.

Dahl's Charlie has nothing on me. We walked into a room where four scoops of Gelato was only the beginning of this Diabetic Coma Affair. We then walked into the back kitchen and there were 5 tables full of any sweet treats you can imagine. Scones, muffins, cupcakes, cakes, brownies, and cookies. Also, a table of wine spritzers and water to wash down the indulgence. They even had their signature, and oh so yummy, English Muffins. It was fun watching them bake them too.   I honestly have to say for the first time ever in my life that I am full. lol --I am actually so stuffed right now and full of sugar I am just staring at the walls in a daze. Teehee. The thought of ever eating another sweet treat again is making me sick. Okay, ask me again in three hours and I am sure I will deny ever saying that.   By the way, the Swag Bag is to die for. Inside were two ten dollar credits to come back for more sweet treats and even more sweet treats in the bag. Sigh, again boo to the summer goal of getting skinny. I have no will power at all.  Thanks as usual to Lindsey who is the queen! Oh yeah, Wow! Did I mention there was even a wedding proposal at tonight's event? So sad I was in the front room and I missed it. I heard the cheering though. How sweet ( No pun intended) of the future groom who knows his gal likes to bake. I wonder if he put the ring inside one of those huge cookies or cupcakes?  :0)

Yum, good burgers. I still like Hopdoddys better but this place has good food. The homemade chips are good but not great. Sweet Tater Tots were good but my friend says they are better at Stax. Hamburger was solid. Looks like they have a great beer selection too if that is your thing. It is in the restaurant's name after all. lol

I had a Salted Caramel ice cream cone last night. The ice cream was very good. I ordered a waffle cone though and got a sugar cone. I am just not a fan of sugar cones. Not sure what that was all about but maybe they only have one type. it was FF so very busy. I did not say anything because well, it was delish either way. lol. The staff were very nice. The only issue is this place is very small so the line goes out the door and claustrophobia can set in. I did not sample any other flavors. I would not drive out of the way to go here but if I am in the area I would definitely go back. I am closer to Churn which has more space and a nicer environment.

Not the biggest lover of hotdogs, unless it is an Italian sausage with extra spice and or a Sabarette in NYC, I find myself contemplating why I have been wanting to go here for like, well, forever! Okay, at least as long as they opened their non food truck restaurant. It all started at the Neil Gaiman book signing. I am sure he is thrilled to be associated with this new addiction to food truck love. lol. I heard all about Short Leash from my downtown working and Food Truck Foodie friends. Then of course I have to continue to hear about it from all my Yelpie buddies. "Afterwards, The Joy!" They actually open a restaurant. I continue to hear all about it as if people were just rubbing it into my face on purpose. Okay, then what? They joined up with Momma Toledo's Pies too? The horror! Looks like a visit is a must. Finally, they are at the Downtown Revival and dare to not even serve any hotdogs. WHAT? What's up with that? ( In my best SNL singing voice) However, redemption is close by since they offer me and my Foodie Buddy this Fried Green Tomato dish with corn and bacon and a very mild Blue Cheese dressing. It was the most Delish, surprising,"twist treat" of the entire night. (And I hate Blue Cheese) Okay, I am convinced. I promise to go visit their permanent location now.  I swing by today after an appointment in the neighborhood. (And to digress, how much do I adore Roosevelt Row? ) I ordered the FGTs of course, again. However, I now have a foodie dilemma. This item is listed as a salad not an App.It is a meal in itself. I was hoping it would be just a small plate App so I could get a dog too. I decide to get both anyway and split the meal as leftovers for tomorrow. I can not see any way out of it. I had to have the FGTs. I dream of those FGTs! lol. I decide to get the pretzel dog too. I am still not brave enough to get the Cracker Jack and Peanut Butter one just yet, although I hear it is "to die" for. Maybe next time. I tell the server that she can bring a box since I will have half now and half for lunch tomorrow. Wishful thinking. Out comes this huge monstrosity of a hot dog smothered in Sauerkraut. I start eating. About half way done I am stuffed. I then look inside the box and did not notice the waitress had already split the meal for me. How sweet of her but seriously? More food. What is on my plate was only half of the dog?YIKES! So instead of two meals I got more like four out of it all.   Anyway, the food was great and the service even better. I had a revelation on the drive home. ( Not a surprising one) I am still not a huge hotdog fan, just saying. However, with Short Leash, who knows? It could happen. I most certainly am a new Short Leash and FGTs fan for life now. ;) If you like dogs check it out. I read they even have a Veggie option. Hmmmm, that sounds weird but I heard it is good.   See you next time Short Leash. Maybe with a four legged patio dining companion. Did I mention I like the Fried Green tomatoes?

The Veggie wrap was Delish. This is an awesome place. I can't really add anything to what the other reviewers have said except maybe I would like to curl up here for a few hours with a great book. If you have to eat good food and drink good coffee why not donate to charity at the same time? I love eating and shopping for a cause.

I was curious what went into the old Cheuvronts since I loved that place so much. Another pizza place? Sigh! I finally went here for a birthday party. The food is good but nothing to write home about. Better than most in town but not spectacular.   The pesto, Hummus dip is bland. It is missing something. What that something is I do not know. Maybe more spices, Basil? I did like the Pizza Pita type chips served with the dip but like I said nothing to die over. I am very picky about Pizza and what I had did not wow me but it wasn't bad either.  I have to admit though the service was amazing. Five stars. Overall, I would go back just to be spoiled. It is a pretty restaurant, has good food, and a good beer selection. Their Churros desert was yummy too.

This was a great evening! I met a lot of new faces. ( Or at least new to me) Bingo was so funny. I can't believe I do not know the Australian Nursery Rhyme or the laugh of a Kookaburra. Bad teacher here! At least I knew what Marsupials were. (Ha,ha redeemed)  I loved all the new bar food apps. We were the first ones to check them out. Woot! I am definitely going to be telling all my peeps about the 4 dollar new bar app plates.   We also got two free drink coins. I had two Margaritas. Since I was the DD, Chris was great to make them light alcohol. In fact, Chris was the best bartender eva. All the servers and staff were ever so nice tonight and extremely helpful. I felt spoiled.   My favorite new app was the Coconut shrimp. Of course the old favorite Blooming Onion is still as delish as ever.  I was so happy for Linda too winning that huge Knife/Culinary basket. She was totally protected for sure on her drive home. lol. It was nice to see how happy she was to win her prize.    Okay Yelp, thanks again for a Blarney Good time Mates! Yawll, have a great day in the Outback.  PS- I was curious and could not resist. Please click on the link.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc_-icFHwQo

So I moved to a new place and it was finally time to check out the services offered in my new city. While I did not like my old neighborhood I loved being a city of Phoenix resident. I was a Phx resident for over 20 years and the services in that city are outstanding. I knew it would be hard to beat their library services, which are gorgeous facilities and well stocked. With that said though, Glendale has a reciprocity agreement so now I can use both. YEAH!  When I arrived at the 59th location I was treated well and greeted by a friendly librarian who signed me up and did a great job explaining everything. This is a smaller branch and not as large or well stocked as the Phx locations but the facilities are very nice. It will do just fine.   What was really fun was on the way home driving out of the parking lot I got to stop for a Peacock crossing, I was like, "Waaaaaaaaaa?" Then I realized they were out walking from the nearby awesome park they live at. So fun and cool!!!! Weird to have to stop in a parking lot to let Peacocks cross living in Phoenix Arizona and all. lol - I hope when you are there you watch out for them. I keep thinking most people might not expect them and might hit them if they drive unsafe.  I would go back to this branch just to see the Peacocks. Ha!

Love the Salsa Bar. The Santisma Veggie Taco is Da Bomb. I did not care too much for the Cactus Veggie Taco but do not hold that against them. The street tacos and Mole are both wonderful too. Great food, divey interior. Great find says the gal who is not the biggest lover of Mexican food. I would go here again. Service was a bit slow though but nice ladies.

WOW! This restaurant is gorgeous! Since my friend's last name is Henry we sure had fun with the camera in regards to the decor and parking signs. Haha. Inside the place I felt like I was back in long Island in South Hampton on an episode of Revenge. lol- classy beach style. Except the whole front door, cheesy arrow sign that does not really match the theme. What's up with that? Okay, truth be told I love it anyway.  I chuckled at another reviewer that said he thought he was in a POLO catalog. I can see that, maybe, but not really. Anyway long story short the place is very pretty as everyone else has noted.   The food and service are typical of a Fox restaurant experience. I have never had bad food or service at any Fox restaurant yet. They have a group mentality when it comes to serving so it is always wonderful with everyone helping. Their staff get extensive training on how to serve and it shows. I just do not believe bad reviews for service. I know stuff happens but I have eaten at Fox restaurants many, many times and it is always the same. All staff  members help at all tables. Their training is superb compared to other food places.   For food we had the Popovers. The verdict is still out for me on the ham flavored butter. I like ham but I am not sure why this product exists. lol The waiter said Vegans like it. I did not dislike it per say I just thought it was weird. I am sure it was a taste thing. I can see the comparison. It tasted like ham but not. To me it had a smoky/gamey flavoring and I do not like that. I had the herb butter as a backup but my friend loved the ham butter. It all worked out okay. We also split a chopped salad, which was good.   Since it was my birthday I was sent a mailing list coupon for a free desert. I got the bread pudding. it was so amazing!  My friend loved their new peanut butter dessert  bar. The drinks are fun here too. My Passion fruit drink was too tart for my tastes but I went with it and it was still "Delish." My friend got the Berry Lemonade which was great! I need to come back to try other entrees and sandwiches. The burger at the next table looked pretty good. ( insert drool marks)   On the way out we noticed the patio, which is gorgeous. When it is cooler a patio date is in my future at the Henry. They should also consider hosting special events out there since it is so pretty.

Yummy!!!!! I love a good BBQ. I went here with my friends because I heard the rave reviews. She got a two meat plate and I got a 2 meat plate. We shared and picked off of each others plates. I literally rolled out of there and could not eat another bite all day. The style is Texas BBQ. Ms. NY ( no, "Get A Rope" comments please)  and Az gal here was not sure I knew what that meant 100% but I found out it meant "YUMMY!" (with a capitol Y) and a slice of white bread on the side.  I was not sure I got the whole white bread thing but my friend said they do that in Texas. I was like, "seriously, white bread huh, no wheat? Brawha!   Anyway, the food is very good. The sausages are DA BOMB!!!!!! The brisket, was delicious as well. I know this is going to sound weird but they have the best Grits. They stuff them with cheese and Jalapenos. I could have just eaten a plate of those all day. YUMMERS! The sides were all standard yummy sides like Potato Salad, Beans, and Cole Slaw.  Of course don't forget about those grits too. I dream of those grits. (who knew this NY'er had some southern gal in her) The chili chocolate pudding was so delish too. I am getting into this new craze of chili's in chocolate. Well, maybe not so new since the tradition has been around for thousands of years. However, the way foodies are experimenting with the idea is so much fun! We literally cleaned the bowls out. And when I say, "clean," we meant it. No need to wash those bowls. They are Throw Aways so no fear. We have no shame.    All in all, if you love good BBQ stop by. Come early though since they sell out.  Oh yeah, the owners and the staff are the nicest people EVA. They love what they do and it shows. Another benefit, "BUY LOCAL!"

What a lovely restaurant. The food and service were wonderful. We ended up here because of a bad experience at another locale on New Year's Day. Boy or boy, we were so glad we came to Grassroots Kitchen and Tap. The decor is lovely, the service was outstanding, and the food was Deeeeeeelish. They sure know how to treat you right. I also, loved the music they were playing.  I had the Chicken Salad sandwich with their specialty Cole Slaw. It was all great! My friend had a hamburger. He mentioned it was outstanding. He wanted it cooked a certain way and they did not fail to please. Not only did it get cooked correctly the chef and server made a point of getting it right and checking up with us to see how they did. I was very impressed. They know food here.  Sadly, I did not get a chance to try that burger. I almost swiped it off my buddies plate. Ha, I will have to go back and try it since I am a sucker for a great burger. Other friends had fish meals and they said all was yummy! The fries by the way are tasty here. I did swipe a few of those. Shhhhh, don't tell. They are cooked to perfection too. My other friend called them crack on a plate. Brawha!  Thank you Grassroots for a lovely holiday get together with my NY Peeps.

This is the best bakery I have found so far in Az. I wish I lived closer. However, then again maybe I do not wish I lived closer. ( waistline issues- ha!) Really Good stuff. They do not have the widest selection though but what they have is excellent.

Good ice cream, nice service. The young lady gave me a few samples. I liked the Peaberry Expresso which had a strong, but not too strong nor bitter Expresso taste. It was very creamy. I also tried the Madagascar vanilla. Yummy. I settled on the Fleur Salted Carmel since I am predictable that way. I love Salted caramel. It was delish! It is not the best ice cream i have had but pretty good for Phoenix and a great location. Return trips are in order for future taste testing, Ha!

The long wait for a Phoenix location has ended. I watched as the sad abandoned Beefeaters building sat wilting away in the Valley heat. I waited in anticipation as the news came out but to only see a pile of heap, rubble and a graffiti tagged building as I passed by, day after day. I cried when the opening was delayed by two weeks. ( Yes, I was that impatient. lol) Finally, "Wala" it is done! I am now in, "Bookie Heaven." This is a multispace, unique location to include; the Indie bookstore, a southern themed restaurant from the Becketts Table chef, a garden store, and a bar. Should be great when it all comes together. Tonight was the grand opening of the bar, restaurant and book store. What a great evening. We love Changing Hands so are looking forward to many signing events and book browsing by that original stone fireplace. Since it was a dress rehearsal, so to speak, they still are working out a few kinks. One thing we noticed is that there is a long stretch at the bar. The space between the serving area and the seats is not user friendly.  If you are sitting in the corner you might want to move over so the servers can really get to you. We also noticed it was very, very hot in the store. I never complain about that so it must have been pretty miserable for the other shoppers. I am sure it will work itself out. The staff is great, so helpful and knowledgeable, and the selection is wonderful. They also have unique and funny shirts, wine accessories, trinkets, and gifts. Welcome to Phoenix Changing Hands. Daily shopping to ensue!

You will not think you are in a taco place at all. Serious disco funky vibe going on. I loved the neon flashing lights in the windows. We found this place by accident looking for the pizza place next door.  We were starving after attending a Mixology event across the street. From the minute we walked in we were treated like royalty. It is very apparent that Dave the manager just adores his restaurant. He is very proud of it and was a wonderful host, stopping by our table many times and yaking it up with us. I really felt at home here.   It was not the best Mexican food I ever had but it was solid. What I had was very good and I would go back. Their Gauc is very flavorful and chunky here. It was delicious and I slaughtered the entire bowl. Haha! I was not a fan of their chips and salsa for some reason. I am not sure why. I think it was much more about me then them. Just a personal taste thing more than the quality of the food. It also could have been the Whiskey talking from the Yelp event we just came from. ;)----Oh yeah, I also had a Carne Asada taco that was pretty good. My Yelp buddy had a chicken Burro that she gave five stars to. They are doing something right for sure. I would go back for the service alone. Talk about being spoiled.

Oh my this place was just awful. My guess is that they will not be around for long. Awful service, not good food at all. Our food came out at different times with a long wait and some of the dishes included the wrong food items. I ordered the Bruschetta and the bread was just terrible. I also ordered the homemade mixed chips and they arrived not mixed. However, to be fair the chips were pretty good. They were very greasy though, but yummy. Everyone at the table was annoyed for one reason or another. Their meal was not good, not enough food for the price, bad service for refills, etc. We had to send back the sweet potato fries too to be remade. Frankly, we were very surprised they even served them. They looked disgusting. They were overcooked and just bad. The 2nd batch was a bit better. The  entire evening was just a mess. It was one thing after another here. I never review a place this low but this was definitely one of the worst dining experiences of my life. 16 dollars for a basket of chips and somehow I scored the best after dinner mint. That is an expensive mess up!

Well, all the four legged and two legged Elites sure had so much fun. My friend assured me her dog crashed the minute he jumped in the car. Based on that review I would say this was a successful event. I wanted to bring my cats but Lindsey said that might get ugly. But seriously, I loved the food, drinks and cupcakes. The art work was amazing. I loved touring all the galleries and chatting with my friends. The Dream Gallery was my second favorite after the host's. My plus one also loved her doggie sketch. Thanks to everyone who made the evening a great success.

They owned a pizza place and an Italian bakery in Long island NY for many years. I grew up right down the street. I had no idea they were here until last year. We have always had great service and food here. We are treated as the restaurant name says; like family. The new location is very nice. Their pizza is one of the better NY style pizzas in the valley, which is sorely lacking in this department. I would go more often but I do not live in the East Valley.  I cherish the NY gatherings we have here though when we all get together.

Owhhhhh, it is as yummy as I heard. Thanks to my BFF for my birthday dinner. The sweet potato hamburger is huge, different, and delish! ( Share it with a friend) The sliders are also unique and yummy! Yes the Mac and Cheese side is as good as you are hearing. This coming from a gal who is not really a Mac and Cheese kind of Foodie.  (Except chef John Marchetti's of course)   I have to say I was surprised to find really good bread here. Just getting back from NY I was already dreading the awful bread situation in Az. I was delighted to find the bread with the olive app is really good!  I really enjoyed the atmosphere of this restaurant and the service was excellent. A bit busy on First Friday but the servers and host were all delightful. The Smores dessert was good. My friend really loved the little cookies they served as dipping sticks. Truth be told, I liked them too but  was just too stuffed to appreciate them for what they probably are. Hmmmm, that means I must make a return trip. Well you know just to be fair and all. Wink!

What a wonderful idea for a monthly film series at a wonderful local cinema. I was transported right back to NY and the original movie theaters of my childhood. Well, all except the fact this one has a bar, a cool lounge, and some great art hanging on the walls. lol. I had never been here before so was very happy to score an invite. My "Plus One friend" loves it here so she was raring to go. I adore the Roosevelt Row area so much so we added this to the really cool things to do in Downtown. Bonus points for eating at Trumpets Ale before the gig. Two new places in one night on Roosevelt Row spells awesomeness.   We tried all day to guess which "surprise, locally filmed movie" they were going to show. I kept guessing "Raising Az" because it is the SunDevil in me. CG hates that one. We sparred all day. I crossed my fingers she wouldn't just walk out if they played that one. All her picks were awesome too! We hope to see any of them in the next few months as Yelp picks. Surprisingly, it was really exciting to go to a theater when you had no idea what movie was going to be shown until the credits started flowing. ( I see this as a new home movie party trend)  Az has a long history of movie magic and we had over 200 films to chose from. We were all on the edge of our seats. When the first words to pop up were "A Lorne Michaels Film" We heard a loud, "WOOP!" from some fellow Rowdy Yelpers.  I still did not know which SNL film it was until the title popped up. I was pretty surprised. I thought I knew most of the films on the local list but forgot about Wayne's World. Lol-- how funny. I relived some of my eighties college music days and definitely those hair band experiences growing up on Long Island listening to Metal/Rock groups like; Zebra, Alice Cooper, and Poison. (Just to name a few)    We had a great time tonight. We can not wait to go back. Coincidentally, I had just watched "World's End" last night. FilmBar is having a "Shaun of the Dead" party on the 25th. I think I heard something about a Zombie Pinata, and that dressing up party Shenanigans were predicted to ensue. Yes, please. Thanks Lindsey and Filmbar Gang for bringing back my "College, "EH-Hem," I mean "Ballroom-- Blitz" drama days.

Another great time at the August showing of "Raising Arizona." How much fun is this place? Thanks Lindsey.

This place is wonderful and Chef is the best. What great conversation ( A smart man) and delicious Caprese sandwiches. A great find. I will be back for sure. The menu is small though. I wish they had more cold sandwich choices. I am a sucker for a good chicken salad sandwich. Hint, hint? Enjoy.

Melissa was great and the Barruta was delish! They are combining two restaurants now while one is being remodeled. I got some Asian soup while I was at it. Hot and Sour soup on a cold, gray day.   I would go back to Cuff. Happy hour seems great too. The menus is limited though and it is a bit spendy. It is a darling little place and one of the few in DT Glendale that is actually open around 3 or 4 o'clock.

I averaged out on this review. 2 and a half stars.  4 for the theme especially if you like Coke memorabilia and 50's music.  1- the place was filthy. My shoes were sticking to the floor. The walls are dirty and dingy, and the tables were never cleaned while I was there. Maybe a paint job will help?  4- Aloha burger was good  1- Homemade chips tasted like fish- Blah! (oil?)  2- Price -9 dollars for a burger and chips. No thanks. I can spend that type of money at another burger place that is known for great burgers.  Also, this place uses take out cups for eat in drink orders. That must generate a lot of trash. I have an issue with this for sure. Maybe just a fluke today or do they always do this?

Cool venue for sure. The middle is open and their are couches and tables on the side. They ave a VIP section upstairs. We had a blast at the USO Heroes Jam. Drinks are expensive though and for some weird reason the women's bathroom stalls are built in such a way you can not exit the stall. I can't imagine what this looks like with ladies who have had a few too many. They must find a lot of cell phones flushed down the toilet. Ha! Rock on!

Well, once upon a time I was in great shape lol. The title of this event says it all. Erik kicked my butt for sure. Not bad on my part since I just had surgery and had not worked out in like three years. This place is a lot of fun and very easy to do a cycle routine. I liked the fancy heart monitor screens. The idea is simple it is a cycle type of workout. You can start on the floor or aerobic. ( treadmills and rowers) The trainer walks you through a workout with specific directions and motivation techniques. Grueling Jililan screaming not included, not to say Erik was easy on me.   Afterwards, we went to Flower Child restaurant. I had been wanting to go for a while now so was happy to finally try it. The place is amazing. All of the food is outstanding but a few stand outs were; Hummus Mixed Guac, Sesame Beef, Glazed Chili Sweet potatoes, Beet Salad, and the Corn Quinoa. Really good clean food with great Fox service. Rob was the manager and was most welcoming and interested in us. The staff was great!  A unique event for sure. I will feel it tomorrow though. ;)

YUMMMYYYYYYY! The triple chocolate cupcakes are the best. Coconut cupcakes are a good second and their eclairs are tasty. Cute shop located right next door to TXAZ Grill. I hear their wedding cakes are the best. The parking lot is awful and kind of dangerous though so be careful driving in and out especially if you are on a sugar high, ha!

I had  a great time. I won the tickets so even better. It was all free to me and my best Bud! Saw a lot of my Favorite Yelpie friends too. I think my tongue is still peeling from the "Angry Crab's" hot sauce. That stuff is Cra, Cra!   I liked the Mirabel Country Club's food the best. Drunken Shrimp with this crazy delish, Cookified, Crispy, Garlicy baked tortilla crisp.  Oh my! I could have eaten just them all night. The Venue's Macaroon option was the most interesting.  The other food was all good too!  The Venue is a cool place for sure. For next time, my thoughts are that they could have had more garbage cans out and maybe water stations to make the flow of the event and bar go a bit smoother. It was awkward trying to eat and walk around. A lot of bumping and spilling occurred, although the trays helped.  I thought the band was great!  I wonder who won the golden ticket?

Boy, I could do some damage here. I had an island themed smoothie and a bagel today between appointments and both were yummy! I want to go back and try it all. My only complaints were they are a bit costly and the girl who helped me was not the friendliest server on the planet. Still, I will definitely be back even though it is not in my hood, sadly enough. I hear their Caprese and Pops Chicken Salad sandwiches are to die for!

3 1/2 stars - Yelp we need half star options.    3 for food  4 for ambiance  Wow, this place has come a long way since it was a HoJos and we used to sneak in from the ASU dorms circuit 1983 to use the pool. Shhhh, did I say that out loud?   I was lucky enough to visit this place twice last week. Once to eat before the show at Gammage. They give a same day discount which I did not even know about. A few days later I visited the hotel for a cocktail reception on the rooftop which got rained out. The reception was rescheduled to the conference room. We did end up on the rooftop later that night after the rain stopped. ( lovely view)    The Normal diner is pretty funky and retro. I love what they did with it. The food is average but an upgraded, funky kind of diner food. Nothing to write home about but not bad either. I had a Cajun chicken sandwich which was okay. The fries however, were cold and not great. At the reception I did have their red velvet waffles and fried chicken and they were actually very good. These are also on the Normal's menu thus why I mention it.   The gals working here are the best. Young and students of course. Go Sundevils.    I might add on show nights you might want to get there very early. I was busy reading and eating and did not notice about an hour before curtain time people were eyeing my table, and me, like hungry Zombies. By the time I had arrived to find an empty restaurant to the time I looked up from my meal and great book the restaurant was packed.    Speaking of books. They attach the bill to a book. LOl and yeah! I adore that idea.   I want to go back to try all their drinks, treaties and other food items. Not bad. Check it out.

I am not a Creole fan at all but this place is great. I did not order or eat in the boil that our larger group participated in. My friends said all the food was good. They had oysters, crab, and clams. I had a shrimp basket with Cajun fries and Cole Slaw. We also shared apps. I liked the Cajun Edamame, Who knew? The fried Calamari is very, very good here. I love their spices and seasonings. Be warned. I  tried level 4 at the Spice festival and I literally could not feel my face for an hour. Be careful. Level 2 seems best. I love their shrimp dipping sauce too. Just a note, I think they have the best Cole Slaw I have ever tasted. I know random, huh? I loved their Cajun fries.

Being a cookie kind of girl and skeptical in general of "Best Of" food lists I smiled and thanked politely when tons of people talked and wrote about this place. I silently smiled when my friends asked, "Have you been to WCAD?" "Not yet" was my polite response. I was really thinking, "Ummm, no, and I never will." I peacefully read article after article and Best Of lists that hailed their almighty Key Lime Donut. Nope, not going unless they have cookies. I silently doubted all the claims. However, when my Foodie friends starting talking I sat up and took notice. I jotted it down on my Spring Break, local Staycation food tour list.   Cookie monster was busy today so I dragged my rear out of bed on the second day of Spring break and drove the 15 miles or so to get there. Okay, I had errands in the area. You'll never know, wink! I might or might not drive many miles for good food in Az. I'm not telling.    Well, forget the donuts. Let me tell you, the one piece Chicken breast combo with Thai Slaw and sauce number 1 was freaking, seriously delish!  Holy Heck, (chicken)  in a hand ( cardboard) basket! Get that, okay?  "The donuts?" you ask, "How were the donuts?" Well here is how that went. I bought a half dozen of the upgraded donuts. I got their signature Key Lime Pie one of course. I wanted to try the Irish Bomber and Chocolate Almond one but they were sold out. Insert sad face. Happy face come back.  The very lovely lady behind the counter threw in a red wine covered something or another as a recommendation, and I ordered a chocolate and an Arnold Palmer Thai Lemonade to boot.  They cost me a weeks paycheck though. Seriously $12.50 for 6 donuts, ouch! I spent my entire spring break food allowance. Sigh! After all was said and done I might or might not be a donut convert, just saying. Sorry Cookie Monster I have a new BFF!  But here is the interesting part I honestly thought just the plain cake donut they gave free with the meal was way better than the upgraded donuts. It tasted better and was free with a meal. You can tell the quality of the donut without all the goodies and stuff on on it. So surprisingly I liked the food here better than the desserts.   By the way, they have one of the best cups of coffee I have had in Phoenix. Just a regular Joe please. So hard to find in Phoenix.  Finally, the staff members are super nice too. And those errands you ask?  Well, never happened because now that it is 90 degrees in March I couldn't let the leftovers spoil, now could I?

I was first introduced to the Earl In Orlando at Downtown Disney and have been a fan ever since. Glad to see them in Az. Sandwiches are delish and pretty cheap. I always get the turkey dinner sandwich which is yummy! Today I had a few cookies too. I tried the Sugar and a Chocolate Chip. They were pretty good for non bakery treaties.

What a pleasant experience I had here for lunch. I would have never known about it if it was not for Yelp.  It is in a random strip mall in an industrial part of west Phoenix. However, it is near my work so on short days I will have to stop by on my way home. It is not the best NY Deli in town but still very good so giving it Kudos on the stars on it's own accord and South West Phoenix is a foodie wasteland when it comes to non Mexican food. I gave the place five stars, and my friends know I am picky with the five stars, because they have Boars Head meats, the owner/manager, I think she said her name was Jen, is fantastic. I observed her for a while during my visit and she really is very special, kind to all her guests, and very customer centered. Jen knew all the customers by name. Gotta love that. I also love seeing kids behind the counter. It reminds me so much of NY.   I had my go to, a chicken salad sandwich. I got a little daring and ordered it on Rye instead of a baguette. It was good. The folks at the table next to me said their meatball was great. I know a return trip is necessary. lol  I think the specialties here are the Pastrami's and Corn Beef type of NY sandwiches. The Rachel looked awesome!  I do not like those things but the customers were saying they were the best in town.   The only thing I can add is that maybe they can carry Yoo-Hoo and Wise products. Please consider adding Onion Rolls to the bread choices too. Also, I like Coke products better than Pepsi but that is a life long argument and debate for another day. Ha!  Literally, the place was jamming with special orders from companies in the area. I overhead all saying this is the new it spot for lunch nearby. I am happy to hear it. I will most definitely be visiting more often.   Thank you for such a lovey lunch experience.

Zoomed in late last night in a neighborhood I was not familiar with after running errands. Nice place. Thanks Yelp for the tip.   * The Falafel and pickled garnish salad were great.  *The Greek fries were good  *I did not care for their style of pita bread but I think it just a  preference thing so no fault of theirs. I found it pretty tasteless. I like my pita bread soft, flavorful and thicker. Here it is more like a puff over with a consistency of a chip.  The service was outstanding. Noel was superb! I really enjoyed it here. I would definitely go back.

This place was not in the least bit like what I thought it would be from tons of friends descriptions. I was imagining a quaint Victorian Tea shop instead of a warehousey looking, small, very bare coffee shop with a small display case of donuts. With that said the ladies behind the counter were top notch thus the four stars. I was on the fence to rate it three or four. Four for local and great service.   I ordered the chicken salad sandwich on a croissant and a cinnamon crunch doughnut hole. The pastry was very tasty but not the best in town and for some reason I disliked the sandwich. I do not know why this is so it might have just been me. I do not hold it against them. I am very picky about my chicken salad and for some reason I did not like the way it tasted. It seemed to have a bad after taste that stayed with me and tasted more like tuna, which I do not like. Like I said I do not hold it against the place. I have preconceived notions and am spoiled on excellent Chicken Salad and it ruins it for other places. I always search but never find an equivalent. Ha! Also, I did not see any other goodies besides doughnuts. I would have liked to buy some cookies or scones to take to my Bunco party. Maybe they were sold out or Sundays are limited?   Since I do not live in the neighborhood it would not be worth it for me to go back when I live closer to the Glendale tea shops. However,  I would definitely go back if I was in the area to try other pastry and to support local business. The ladies were so funny and kind that I most certainly would go again just to visit them. If you live near by I would say check it out. I have friends in the neighborhood who swear by their pastries and just plain regular coffee.

A very nice place to lunch. Lots of choices and eclectic menu. The owner maybe, or manager ( man from Detroit) was very sweet. I enjoyed eating here. I had the half sandwich combo with the Caprese sandwich and a garden salad. I would definitely go back and try some of the other creations.  I thought the reviews about length of service were so strange. I even noted to self how fast the service was. I noted the fact the food was delivered to where I was sitting with a big smile instead of me picking it up with my call out number.

Not bad. Smaller theater. You go inside to purchase tickets. There is no outside box office so the other reviewer is mistaken about the pigeon poop, unless they remodeled since then. The Woman's bathroom on the east side is very small with only three stalls and the floors were dirty. On the plus side the service was great. Very nice folks and plentiful staff on site. The seats also recline, which is very nice.   Things that could be better; the movie is way too loud. The booming noise of the movie next door interfered with our very loud movie too. For some reason there were a lot of folks running up and down the aisles tonight. The floors/stairs/aisles are really echoey for sure. They make a lot of noise when you are just walking down them forget when you are running or jumping. It sounded like an earthquake. Very distracting. The theater is really a three star review but I upped it to four for the nice treatment I received.

Very cool space, not a lot of food options. I liked the juice place with the free samples. The space is pretty amazing. They need live music upstairs or maybe they have it when it is not First Friday.

Call me next week I'm going to the Container Store. Ha! It is like Ikea for storage. Cool things to see, lovely friendly staff, day dreaming, and fun. The only thing is the stuff here is pricey and not cheap. Containers at the box stores are way cheaper. However, Many things are unique here. I have never seen some of the items before. White board tape? Ummm, teacher here says,"Yes please and who knew? I picked up a few items like a Scarf Hook hanger for my closet and an expanding shelf for my spice cabinet. And, "yes," I know you are dying to ask, I did buy the White Board tape and made some white boards for my students.

Cool venue, nice patio. I love refurbished old warehouses. I probably can not really add to what everyone else said. It reminds me of the Yard a bit. I had the Philli steak sandwich, with fries and a side salad. The salad was a bit bland but maybe that was my dressing choice. The sandwich was actually very, very good but be warned very, very messy! Lol. Have lots of napkins close by. My friend said his Cheeseburger was very good and very messy too. The fries here are very tasty. The place is costly though so not sure I will be back often. I would however like to try the steak place next door. The menu is so eclectic. Lots of cool choices for food. The patio will be nice to sit outside and have some beers and play some games. Lots of TV's in the place and a cool looking cigar bar. They also have live music planned. Lots of fun check it out.

The Pizza was pretty good, NY style pie. The Garlic Knots- not the best in town, kinda bland though the dipping marinara sauce was pretty good. They have very nice service, friendly folks. I loved that they are from Brooklyn.

I wish I liked hotdogs.   Great new place in the hood. The folks working here are great!  I got the Chicken Parm sandwich which is huge and slathered in cheese. It comes with a side order choice between some salad choices and or house chips.  I ordered their house made chips which were okay. I do preface that though because I am very spoiled after eating the chips at  Market by Jennifer's. Those chips spoil you to all others. Lol   If you are form Upstate Ny stop by the digs are cool.   The prices are a bit spendy though. I will say I got two and I could have gotten three meals out of my sandwich.

Thank you Waffle Love for coming to the State48 grand opening today. Your Waffles are spectacular and you are the best. The two young ladies that attended this event were the best! Yummy! The best advice i can give is that you should share. One waffle is huge!

What a crazy experience this has been opening a restaurant in Phoenix. So of course I read all the hype and stories over the past year and a half and in regards to last week's grand opening. I was going to wait a while before visiting because let's be honest, everyone who knows me knows how picky I am about good pizza and only the NY style. Besides, who lines up at 11am for a 4pm restaurant opening? Well, I guess Malnati's fans do. Even the staff thought they were nuts-lol! I am not even that much of a Foodie.   So, I happened to find myself in the same shopping center today, coincidence? I think not! I walked over to investigate the hype and to get a menu. ( I could not find one online) Well, I got there at about 3:15 knowing they do not open until 4pm. I took a peek inside. A young lady walked right out and started talking to me. She handed me a menu and told me that they open at 3:30pm. They really do not open until 4pm. However, if they are ready they have been opening up earlier to let people in due to crowds. That seemed impressive to me so I hung around and waited. They opened at about 3:50. I was first on line. I am kind of proud of that. I am not competitive much, am I? While on line I had a lovely chat with a family friend of the owners who flew out to help and check things out. Also, the staff comes out and offers bottles of water to those waiting online. This place seems more like destination dining but more on service later.   I was sat quickly after walking in. (Ha, I was first) This place must run on the original 5 second rule because before my behind even hit the seat my server Dave was at my table. Maybe, to make up for the wait outside? He went through his little spiel and we chatted. I could not remember if I had their pizza before on my varied trips to Chi-Town. I believe I might have tried it at Taste of Chicago but could not remember. Dave took my order and was pretty great, and so hilarious to boot. I liked Dave. He is very flexible. He knows the art of compromise! He will make a good husband some day to a lucky young suitor. I say this because after a little back and forth throw down on whose pizza is better, he took the fifth and agreed the customer is always right. ( Maybe he didn't really believe it to be so but I am okay with that) We finally agreed that when I am in Chicago I will eat pizza with a fork and when he is in NY he will eat pizza folded over with his hands. lol. Gotta love Dave! In fact, I have to say the service here was amazing. You are fawned over. For such a busy place they got it down. I like team concept restaurants that share the service. None of that, "This is not my table." baloney.  Okay, so onto the food. It seems my Peeps are divided over this place and their pizza so I was fairly warned. The pizza is different. I was wholly prepared to think of them as two different beast and I agree they are. If I see it this way then I found the food to be very good. ( except i did not care for the lemon garlic salad dressing for some reason) This type of pizza is not the same as NY style pizza. The crust is called "butter crust" and it tastes more like a bakery item. Maybe more like a good bakery bread or even cake. The pizza has more sauce on it and less spices and is baked together with the cheese so is a bit blander than the NY style, oily, spicy stuff I love. It seems like it is more like a casserole or pie/Calzone then a slice. I like my pizza with more spices on it. However, I admit I really liked theirs too for what it was. The butter crust is so very good. I could eat just that. I am not saying I did and I am not saying I didn't, okay? However, there might be video of me picking at my pizza and just eating the crust. Okay, who am I? I have come a long way from the Long Island girl who used to hide her crust under her napkin as a kid. Ha!  So great place. The line was out the door when I left and people were vying for my up close parking spot. I think my 1 hour door to exit dining experience was not typical right now so if you are inpatient you might want to wait a bit before you go. Lunch service is suppose to start in June but the menu says it is express pizza. That must mean their pies are Pre-Made. One takes 35 minutes to make. I might drop by for lunch for other menu options when it quiet downs a bit.   So Zonies and Chi-Town transplants, enjoy but sorry Dave, I still like NY pizza better. Maybe return dining is needed for more taste testing?  ( Insert winky, smiley emoji) Happy eating all. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention all their servings are made for two- four people even their desserts. Single servings are even too large for one person so plan accordingly, or for leftovers at least.

A lovely Tapas and Wine bar new to the Central corridor area. I had won some gift cards at a charity auction and was itching to try this place. We went on Christmas Eve and had a lovely evening. The owner stopped by our table and the server was just fantastic. We felt spoiled. It was a lovely evening.   Remember if you go Tapas are small plates. Americans struggle with this concept so please come prepared for small plates and to eat like a European. It annoys me to read bad reviews based on the fact that is what the restaurant is specializing in serving. If you want large plates go somewhere else.   We had the Flank steak, Bruschetta, and Brussel Sprout salad. Everything was great! Their sampler dessert was out of this world.   Thank you and good luck in the hood with your new digs!

I would never have picked a place like this to go on my own but I bet if Country is your thing you will think this is the place to be. I am so glad to see High street get going finally. A cool little area of north Scottsdale to hang out at.   If you eat here you might consider sharing everything since they give you a lot of food. I am writing this the next day and I still have a food coma. Ha! I got the burger which was good and huge. Not the best burger I have ever had but tasty. They mixed the meat here so it is a beef and pork mixed. I did not like the fries at all. I should have sent them back since they were soggy and cold but I pick my battles when I eat out.   The folks I ate with had the blue chicken sandwich and tenderloin and they said they were both excellent. The corn bread was very average and nothing to write home about. Although the jam and butter served with it were fun! To be fair the menu is kind of eclectic for a cowboy place. They have some odd add ons like lobster corn dogs, and Fried Green Tomato Caprese Salad so it looks like you can find something to eat besides typical Cowboy Food.   I enjoyed the historical Arizona decor and pictures. I actually bumped a three star food place to a four because of the environment. I am not a country type of gal but the place is fun! They have a bar and a huge dance floor. They even give dance lessons. Hey this Rock and Roll gal even though that was cool. I loved watching the kids dance. I guess Wednesday is family night. I think kids eat free or something. As long as they place some other songs besides CANDW every now and again I might even hit the dance floor some night.  I have to admit the service was a bit slow but not horrible. Maybe this is really a three and a half star review but go ahead and check it out and see for yourself. Lots of energy here to pick you up after a stressful day.

I adored my visit here. Everything was just so spot on. I wrestled back and fourth between a four and a five star review. Yelp does not give half stars and I rarely give five. ( I wish they would give half stars) so I decided to vote up due to my server Austin and the wonderful service I had for lunch today. The staff made me feel like I was a guest in their home.   I love the eclectic, feel to the place. The brick walls give me a Chitown/NY bistro feel to the place. All the food was absolutely delicious! I had the Crab cakes, lunch special with the Kale  and quinoa mini salad and Portabella Panini. I was surprised I actually liked their shoe string fries which I rarely enjoy. (Aioli chili oil, yum!) I also ordered a cup of coffee based on the reviews and yes it is good. I also liked the Mango Ice tea for once. It was not too syrupy sweet and gross like at other places. I did not have dessert but that pistachio ginger, carrot cake has my name written all over it for next time.   I can't wait to go back. Oh yeah, did I mention they have activities? Flamenco and Jazz guitar and Paint Nights? Waaaaaaaaa???? Yup, many returns predicted.

Hmmmm, this is weird. I am eating and reviewing a hotdog place. I am not even a hotdog fan but I had the best experience here today. The owner is a delight and the food is great. Their Hot Dogs are very similar to the Snappers, natural casing Sabbrettes NY'ers will understand and impossible to find here. The quality is great. I had the Hawaiian and I also had a waffle for dessert. Despite other reviewers I do not think they are too expensive. Not sure where these other folks are eating great Hot Dogs for under 6 Bucks a meal for top quality. The waffles are not as good as the fancy waffle places popping out all over town but I still thought they were good for three bucks.  They have a lot of different dogs to try from Chicago, NY, Phili, and Sonoran, just to name a few. Yes, they only have two sides right now. Both are Doggone Delish though. ( See what I did there?)

The low reviews on here totally shock me. This restaurant is fantastic! To each his own. My guess is some folks might not know food or understand the restaurant's concept. If you are looking for traditional Southern food this might not work for you since it is a fusion, modern type of fare.   Let's start with the decor. Very low key, rustic type of warehouse. It was not part of the original structure, as others incorrectly mentioned, but an add on. I asked and was told it was constructed new not redesigned. The feel of the original building, which is now Changing Hands Bookstore and First Draft Bar, were taken into account. The restaurant has very pretty chandeliers and low key ceiling art. My guess is they were trying to replicate a rail dining cart with big windows, lots of light, and that huge clock on the wall that reminds me of a rail station clock. The bar is to the east and the tables are all just lined up to the west. Very simple elegance and grace. The only thing I noticed missing, and even suggested, is that they need an "architectual" type of pineapple sign or wall hanging at the door since they did not incorporate one into any of the wall designs. This is steeped in southern tradition as a welcome.  Now on to the "loud" comments. I never even noticed the "Too Loud" thing and I am very sensitive to loud noises. After reading the reviews we did notice it was loud. However, we loved it. We enjoyed seeing the joy and celebration on the other patron's faces. The community table was having a blast! We felt that It was not shockingly loud but yes I suppose it is a fun place being part of a bar and all. If we wanted quiet we would go somewhere else. I would never have noticed if my friend did not want to know what the reviewers were saying while we ate. She made me look it up. lol.  I would never dream of taking stars off of a restaurant for something like that since it is the theme of the place. I would just note it as a tip or a comment in the review. At no time could I not hear my friend or servers so it could not have been that loud and the place was packed. ( We got there early and reservations at the "Rail" are suggested)   Of course one wants to know about the food. It's totally fantastic. With one of the top noted chef's in AZ how could it not be. Now it is different so be forewarned.  Open you mind to the notion. I know a challenge for most Arizonians. lol. I got the Meatloaf Special. It came with these bread pudding sticks. My guess is these are the chef's version of Southern Hush Puppies. I asked the waitress but she did not know what Hush Puppies were. That kind of shocked me. lol --Even Ms. Nyer here knows what a Hush Puppy is. Two stars off for that. (Insert sarcasm marks here)  These Bread pudding Hush Puppies, which I will call BPHP from now on, were divine! Also, my Meatloaf was out of this world. My friend had the Chicken and Dumplings. She was expecting chicken and dumplings on a plate and not the broth based type of dish she got. She could not stop raving about it. I tried it. Okay, twice but "Shhhhhhh" don't tell. It was mouth watering. The Dumplings were so crazy good. Since it was my birthday we had to have desert. My friend got the Bread Pudding and I got the Beignets. We shared. We thought we would take home  leftovers. Nope. The Bread Pudding here is sinful and the donuts are huge. Actually, one of the donuts made it home for next day breakfast but the Bread Pudding was a goner. I have to say Piggy noises could be heard while the pudding was being inhaled. Okay, Pigs are southern, right? ;) I could come here every day just for the dessert. I heard the Coconut cake here is to die for too and I love Coconut cake.   Some people mentioned that service needs to be fine tuned. Well, they must have fixed that up real quick because our service was great. Despite being very busy and a popular place the service was wonderful. I was even walked to the bathroom by a manager. Many folks were walking the floor and stopped by to greet us. Our server was delightful, well in all ways except for the not knowing what a Hush Puppy was. Okay, I have to let that go.  I am kidding of course, for those who do not know me. But really? She does not know what a Hush Puppy is and works in a Southern themed establishment. Again, kidding, our server was really great. Teacher here taught her something new so I am happy. I wish I knew her name. I want to send her a hug and a Hush Puppy T- Shirt. Hahahaha! I love you pretty, wonderful, smiley blonde server, unknown name, friend.    So, all in all my birthday dinner was great! They open in August for lunches too. I'm so there. I predict every weekend since school will have started. Parking is fine despite other review. I have never had a problem. There are lots and street parking surrounding The Newton. There's also a huge Light Rail lot right across the street. Darn it! You might have to walk a NY quarter block.   Enjoy Beckett's Southern Hospitality.
