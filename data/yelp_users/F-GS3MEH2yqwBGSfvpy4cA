I have had back problems since I was a child. Then I was in a pretty bad car accident causing me ongoing daily back pain. I started seeing Dr. Enriquez for this ongoing back pain. Little did I know, so much more could be helped by chiropractic care! My headaches and back pain have been greatly relieved while under Dr. Enriquez's care. They have great massage therapists as well! I love that I get personalized care in a timely manner that really works!

Really good service! The physician was very pleasant and o was treated in a timely manner. You can make an appointment online, which I would recommend.

Really great food! I like that they are dog friendly too. It's too bad that their service is terrible. Both times I've been there our server rarely checked our tables or refilled our drinks. The wait staff doesn't seem to care about their tables. Which is probably why they are rarely busy.

Such a cute place! And the staff is really nice! I got an iced coffee and coconut donut, they were both super tasty.
