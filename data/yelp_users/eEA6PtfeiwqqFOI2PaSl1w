the whash itself was fine, especially because I chose only their $4 basic..  but driving home one of the silver strips flew off my door (around the window) and so that's forever lost.  not blaming it on the car wash, was just coincidence butas never happened before!  anyway, i'll give them another shot with their other wash option..  they're close to home and it's an older car anyway. ;)

Been here before quite some time ago probably for a burro.  Came in today just for menudo. I won't be back for it again.  Before I could taste a spoonful I had to skim out quite honestly about 1/4 cup of oil/fat first. It literally filled the little styrofoam cup the onions/cilantro come in.   They don't clean the tripe, each piece had a layer of gooey fat on it.  Spoons were itty bitty, especially if your bowl had the pata.

We waited at least an hour for our dinner.    One table had been waiting 2 hours .  The other was waiting 1 1/2 hours .  Though we had "only" waited one hour we saw what lay ahead.  The place was NOT even full, there were many many empty tables and our server was flustered and joked about wanting to sit and rest for a bit.   She told us our order would not be a little 15 minute wait but gave no clue it would be over 1-2 hours.  Our table as well as the others asked for the manager, she offered the 2-hour table a measly $10 discount off their tab.  After a lengthy wait gain after we asked for at least salads or something all 3 tables left.  Some had small children that were very well behaved given the fact they were quite hungry.  We all left dissatisfied with this place.

Didn't think anyone could ruin chicken strips and Fries but they sure did tonight.  Strips were burnt and fries you could nearly crack a tooth on. But the ranch was excellent

Service as always was exceptional. The ladies are quick to greet you, seat you and take drink orders. Food comes out piping hot and fresh as can be. Tried the fish fillet in garlic sauce this time and it was delicious.

Came for a family birthday and were seated in the Santos room.  The decor and ambiance is nice, the temperature was much too warm with what felt like no AC, just a small electric vertical fan.  The service was mediocre .  Took a long time for drink refills or needed to ask more than once.  Of our party they forgot to take the order for two people .    Chips tasted stale and like old oil, salsa was ok .

Came for a family birthday this past weekend and were seated in the Santos room.  The decor and ambiance are nice, the temperature was much too warm with what felt like no AC, just a small electric vertical fan.  The service was mediocre .  Took a long time for drink refills or needed to ask more than once.  Of our party they forgot to take the order for two people .    Chips tasted stale and like old oil, salsa was ok . The nachos were sent back due to flavor of oil and ordered something different .

I've never tried something I didn't like here .  My fave is jade red chicken, an emerald chicken quesadilla , retried beans and jerk rice .  Finished off with a snickerdoodle and I'm a happy gal .

Stopped by for the first time today. I'll be back! Started with the hot jasmine tea. Then the pot stickers which were piping hot and really flavorful, we wound up getting a second order they were so good .  My entree was number 26 pan fried flat rice noodles with beef pork and chicken . I added shrimp for $2 more.  The brown sauce was really tasty and the veggies were crisp and perfect .

Not a big fan of the customer service at this location.  I've been with Verizon for about 19 years and today , tho I know I have an older plan, the rep Sala seemed like she was annoyed to be assisting us because my family member was downgrading from a smart phone to a basic phone and her tone when trying to explain why I had an old plan and NEEDED to upgrade put me on the defensive and I really didn't want to change .  I ultimately agreed to buy when my family member decided to just activate his old basic phone instead of paying almost $200 for a new basic phone she seemed even More bothered to have to do that for us so I left without having her change my plan after all.  I go to someone who cares about the customer and can explain the benefits of change without having that TONE.  I needed assistance with my IPhone 6sPlus but I'm going elsewhere.

My third visit here, not sure if I'll make a fourth.  After a lot of attempts we finally made it here for their brunch menu.   My mother had been wanting to try their skillet pancake after seeing it on Food Network.  I was looking forward to having their Eggs Benedict with salmon again.    Our service with Ryan was good.  We had a couple issues with our dishes though.   A side order of bacon that we'd requested as "crispy" was not, and the skillet pancakes apparently are not made fresh upon ordering? There was some ore made in the kitchen visable from entering the restaraunt and when served they failed to come with the cooked apples and whipped cream on top.  We had to ask for them and server then noticed they were bare .  After all the anticipation it was less than stellar.  My eggs Benedict : eggs were cold and although poached, they were very undercooked still.  The inside whites were visably raw and watery.

All I have ever ordered here is the 2 Gorditas dinner (carne Asada ) . It's perfectly cooked and seasoned and mouth watering .  The Gorditas themselves are crisp on the outside and fluffy in the Inside

This was our second visit, the first was  about a year ago (?). I'd loved the crab Landry and sweet tea and trying to come back for it again.   Finally made it in today, ordered the crab Landry, fried pickles,  onion rings , fresh salad and jambalaya. The crab Landry was good as I'd remembered , tho needed a bit of salt and hot sauce . The fried pickles dipped in Cajun ranch were a treat.   We give 4 stars instead of 5 cuz the jambalaya was dry. Our waitress came to check on us and when we hesitated she asked if it was dry and offered to bring a cup of their gumbo sauce. That did help somewhat.  Their sweet tea was perfect and she kept us refilled with a new full cup to take home .  Hoping to make it out again soon to introduce some relatives to FOL.  Looking forward to it

I've been here several times, have had breakfast burritos, tacos, combo plates, horchatas.  It's always great.  Well seasoned.

Stopped in today for my second visit. My first was several months ago and I'd tried a Saigon Crepe for the first time which I'd enjoyed.  Today's visit I was less impressed. I had the pho dac biet. Pho with rare beef, brisket, tripe, meatball.  I didn't love it. The broth was lacking in flavor even after adding soy sauce Hoisen sauce, sriracha and the fresh veggies.  My BFF raves about thus place but I'll stick to the places I love.

Came in today for VIP  wash.  It was just ok.  Outside of car is fine.  Inside I have a grease stain on passenger seat, the console , stick shift area us all dusty still and the door panels are dusty still.  It all should have been clean as part of VIP .  Not impressed. But I didn't notice till after I drove off and they closed at 6.

Came in yesterday for my first visit.  They're a very busy salon but got us a chair right away and started in us without delay.  I had Tracy and she did my mani and pedi.  Best pedi I've had! Super smooth and perfectly polished .  She patiently tolerated my ticklishness :)   I'll definitely be back and refer others

this is by far the best goodwill e.v.e.r.!   my first visit was last weekend on their 50% off day, and though I had to park down the street!, it was a great time (5 1/2 hours there!).  yes we had to wait at the checkouts in a line waiting for an available shopping cart, but well worth it.  I found a lovely kate spade purse, George foreman contact roaster, a rotisserie roaster, (both heat perfectly and were in near-new condition)  many excellent cook books, a lovely hand made crochet blanket, many many items in excellent condition.  so much there still had tags from the stores!.    very clean, plenty of staff keeping things orderly and restocking with new donations.  I went again today and found more goodies.  my fave new GW location!

found them by chance.  I was in the stripmall for another business and saw their signs. popped in and the place was busy!  lots of families, all seated enjoying treats I've never heard of before.   Tositos Preparados, Churros Locos, and some other things.    I tried their sonoran hot dogs as I've not had one in a couple years and they were excellent.  now that the summer heat's here and they're close by i'll be sure to try a raspado.  the melon and peaches and all the fruits looked so delicious and refreshing!

I've been here several times now and order either the 3 item grilled combo (choosing beef pork and chicken) and it comes with soup, house salad and pickle salad, ginger and garlic dressing, jasmine steamed rice or vermicelli.   Or I order the pho #1 Angelina's special.  Brisket tree beef tendon tripe meatballs rice noodles onion and cilantro.  Either dish are my faves.   Service Is always exceptional.  Orders are brought out promptly.  The inside is clean, music playing, the bar side has tvs and the music overhead .

Always exceptional food, can't go wrong with anything you choose.  I gave four stars this time because of the wait.  . The food is really 10 stars. The wait wasn't.  We reserved for 10 people and after ordering have been waiting over an hour for our dishes.  We asked about the delay and were told they had other table they're working on.  We were the second table here and the people after us are receiving parts of their orders.  They have only two chefs tonight but very few customers.  No idea why it's over an hour . We will still come back but because we came for a 40th birthday and wants a special evening, it was definitely not that .

Stopped back in, it had been a while and liked the changes in the dining room and bar area .  They switched which door for entry so while we were dining , we could see many many people outside still trying to use the original entry to find it locked, then trying the other door a few yards away .  Our greeter said they're trying to pull focus to the bar dining area but we still chose the quieter dining room .  Our server was new but she did really well.  She took our orders quickly, brought out our drinks and appetizers quickly and then entrees without delay.  Big improvement to our previous visits and we were happy :).   We got to sample something new to the menu , filet of cod, it had a light coating on it, really delicate and topped with a cucumber salad. Definitely would have that again .   My pho was perfect .  I had Angelina's Spicy Lover.  So good .

My fave go-to for any occasion.  I've been here three times this week to celebrate my birthday and friends birthdays . Tonight I tried the Black Pepper Beef which is so flavorful.  We had the salmon in foam, a new dish on the menu and the number 7 Angelina's spicy lover.  On point as always .   The service from Brit was attentive and  and fast.  All the reasons I keep coming back !

Came in tonight with the family, I asked for something off menu and they agreed to make for me.  California rolls in a bowl topped with par-baked salmon and  Delicious sauce on top.  They brought out something different but was just as delicious .   We also had calamari as appetizer , bang bang shrimp, spring rolls and salmon rolls, Angelina's spicy lover pho, and Angelina's special pho. Everything is perfect

Went in with my BFF last week for our first visit .  We each ordered beef pho.  She had the number 13 Pho tai (?) and I had 12 I forget the name but was the beef pho with tripe tendon beef and meatball.  My friend is more the 'connoisseur' of pho.   Really tunes in to the broth flavors wherever we go.  Says if its more fishy or weak.  She said this was in her top 2 faves.   I basically just say if i like something or not and i did love it. she said it was a tie with Angelina's.  Pho Viet's  broth was so flavorful and even though it was 117 degrees outside, we just wanted to drink it!   We also ordered their #8 appetizer crispy butter garlic wings.  The order came out to us quite Non-crispy and were actually raw in the middle.  The busboy took them from us right away apologizing and as we were waiting I believe it was the manager that came out to again apologize and ask if we wanted anything else while we waited for new wings.  (Very handsome BTW).  We didn't , and when our server brought the new wings they were incredibly delicious.  Nice and crispy , not sure what the spices/seasoning was but it was potentially addictive .  Taking a long shot guess but Asian 5-spice?  We will for sure be back for the wings and  venture around the menu!

My first visit here , I was in  the area and saw the shop, they opened in 30 min so I killed some time in the area waiting .  It was well worth it.   I was greeted by a mask wearing piano player and amazed with the fun decor . I had to remind myself I was there for lunch and not taking taking pics :).   As it was my first visit the server gave me samples of the meats . I only had to sample a few to know I'd love them all.  Juicy and flavorful , spicy, delicious .  I ordered the 5 tacos, side of rice and beans . They didn't have horchata ready yet so I had pop.  I tried all the topping except lettuce.  Everything was fresh and tasty. Beans were great, rice was cilantro lime perhaps? Nice bright flavor .  Tried their salsa bar and liked them all.  Posted pics to my FB and spread the word to my friends . I'll be back !

My second visit here to introduce my BFF and she loved it .  We both ordered the three-taco plate , no sides .  I chose the adobada, carne asada and a spicy beef, she chose three different mild options .   Their green salsa at the little salsa bar was hella spicy and I loved it.   Looking for more friends to bring over .  I'll be back :)
