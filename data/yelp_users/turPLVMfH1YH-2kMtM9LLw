A pricy place to grab a bite. The plating of the food is beautiful, but the portions are a little small for the money. The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated, but I could barely hold a conversation over all the noise. I was taken aback at how loud it was. There was a DJ spinning as well and, to put it nicely, I wasn't a fan of his "skills". The noise volume absolutely smothered the meal and destroyed the atmosphere for me.

I really dig the flower selection as well as all the healthy food choices. The store is always squeaky clean and fresh looking! Surprisingly enough, the only real set backs to the place are the people who shop there. I have seen unprovoked rude behavior in the parking lot, in the store, even in the check-out line. That obviously can't be blamed on the store and, sadly, is expected at a more expensive grocery store. Definitely my first stop when I need to cook for the family.

Absolutely love their staff! First drive-thru I've been to where they actually care whether or not they have your order right. Great place at night!

If you're looking for a board game, card game or, well, ANY game you can't find at GameStop, try here! Their selection is huge, from games to figurines to key chains and novelty candy. Better yet, they're friendly and really seem to know what they're talking about.   They also offer in-store tournaments and competitions. So much fun!

A great selection of chocolates and sweets, including a pleasantly surprising amount of sugar free products.

Great place to be when I can't sleep and the sun's coming up! Showing up at 5am and snagging one of those hot, straight-from-the-ovenpumpkin muffins and a latte, watching the world light up as the sun rises... What a divine (and delicious) way to start any day!

I don't know where to start. I work in Arizona Mills Mall, so I'm really limited to Paradise Bakery if I want to want to eat somewhat healthy. As much as I love the food, the service is just... Bad. Again, I go here quite often and the people behind the counter are ALWAYS bumbling around like they have no idea what they're doing. There ha been times when I've had to raise my voice to get their attention because they were busy chatting with each other behind the register.   Not only that, but my order is almost always wrong. And with my short lunch breaks, I really don't have time for it. Chicken caesar salad and they forget the chicken? Or the dressing? Or timed where I've literally handed them a note saying what I wanted and I still get something completely wrong? Please. The employees are incompetent.

This place was heaven when I was a kid. The crazy noises, the lights, the prizes. It was paradise. It's a little different now that I'm an adult (paying my own way), but it keeps bringing back those memories, as well as making plenty of new ones.

I had a surprise birthday party here once and it was absolutely lovely :) Not only was the staff helpful and compliant, but they went above and beyond to make it fun for everyone, from the old to the very young. Thanks for playing along, guys!

What a cool store! It boasts a huge variety of unique items that I've never seen for sale before in a retail store. The best part? Reasonable prices. Definitely a place to look into if you're exploring Arizona Mills Mall!

This place really does have an outstanding selection of animals. I've seen everything from giant koi to snakes to even a stingray. If there weren't covered in price tags, it could pass as a small zoo.   I have exotic pets and they have a great selection of specialized items for each kind. It really makes it easy being able to drive down and pick stuff up instead of having to find and order it online.

Truly a beautiful store. I really don't enjoy other grocery stores like I do this one. Go Fry's!

My all-time favourite hang out spot! The staff are all friendly and personable, the atmosphere is a delight and the place is lovely! Not mention the quality product and the great big couches! Hands down the best hookah lounge in the valley. You won't find that holier-than-thou attitude I've gotten from staff at most of the other places around.  They also offer live music several times a month and host group events. Make sure to come in early to avoid cover charges or a full lounge!

Great restaurant! It really is nice to look at and the food is great. My friends and I have stopped in just to chat and soak up up the atmosphere over some chips and shirley temples!

Rainforest Cafe is a dream for kids and adults alike! The store outside the dining area is full of cool toys and stuffed animals and the aquarium pillar is absolutely stunning. The bar is incredible as well! Seeing the fish swim around is fascinating (as well as a good distraction for the children). If you're willing to lay down some serious money, this place is great.

Where to begin with this bookstore... It's hard to even tell. Here goes nothing.   Well, first off, I LOVE IT. I lived right down the street for many years and wandered around a lot. There's areas to sit and read and a water cooler by the restrooms. The book selection is huge! I mean, they really have something for everyone. When I feel like a good psychological thriller to keep me up at night, it's there. When I'm feeling maybe a manga or comic book, it's there. And when I really need some sickeningly romantic junk to make me feel spicy, hey, they have that, too. There's also always a hefty line-up of speakers and different workshops that are held on location, as well as book signings. Exciting!  Aside from the books, they have tons of other things. The children's selection is just too cute. Resting on a raised platform, it's crammed with toys, books, stuffed animals and racks of Folkmanis hand puppets. I have a formidable collection of them!   Changing Hands also boasts a selection of artisan made merchandise like toys and  dishes that truly are unique and beautiful. They've showcased different local designers and are always changing their displays. Way to stand out!  Close to the entrance, they have isles of different things like bumper stickers, pins, charms, cards, toys and whatever else to keep you entertained. When I'm bored, this is usually where I end up.  The location is lovely as well. It sits right next to and is linked inside to a gorgeous Wildflower Bakery. How convenient! I can get a flaky breadbowl and have something to read!  In summation, it's really a great place to shop, read and eat. They even have a rack of free books located outside!

The man behind the counter was very quick to find out what I wanted, which I really appreciate in stressful situations (especially ones concerning my car!) My problem is that he quoted 20 minutes tops to swap out a tire and I was in the waiting room for well over an hour without a word from the man. I had to hunt him down myself just to find out that, because I had patched the tire, he legally couldn't swap it out for some reason. I had told him about the patch in our first conversation and it is beyond me why it took him an hour and a half to tell me.

I really enjoy shopping in packed, colorful places. Claire's is no exception! Their earring selection is wonderful and they're always coming out with new lines of merchandise. It's quite a trendy store, even if it's targeted at younger girls. I wear my Claire's accessories with pride! ;) This location is almost always busy.   I've gotten my ears pierced here many times (they did 15 studs in my left ear, believe it or not) and, despite what you've heard about piercing guns, I've never had a problem with any of them. They don't used spring-loaded guns anymore and for the price, it really cannot be beat.

Very unique environment. Customers are allowed to paint on the walls! The drinks are wonderful and I enjoy their ramen as well. The younger girl is incompetent, but the rest of the staff is great.

I have never really enjoyed Cafe Istanbul. From the attitude from the staff (catch them on a bad day and they're downright rude) to how insanely difficult it can be to even get new coals, I'd just rather go somewhere else with my friends.

Lovely place! It's a very cozy and friendly place to eat and drink. It definitely looks and feels like a real pub! Worth checking out (I recommend the blue cheese salad).

If any place reminds me of my high school days (other than my high school itself), it's definitely Amados. Located right down from Marcos de Niza, it's a student hotspot for lunch time and after school! And being a 24-hour restaurant, it's great for a bite any time of the day. They offer seating outside as well which is lovely when the weather is nice!   Even better news? On top of their already great prices for whopping meals, they offer a free bean or egg and potato burrito with any purchase over $7!

Definitely my favorite place to go for sushi. The rotating bar is fun and usually has a good selection of different rolls. It's also nice to be able to make special orders and requests. Great staff! Antony is so friendly and personable that I've actually gone in for lunch specifically to tell him about a new job, show him a hair cut, etc..  The music selection is very modern and they do get very busy during certain hours. It's a great place to hang out or do business.

Best tattoo place I've been to! Not to sound hokey, but I was literally a bit shocked when they quoted the first piece I had done there. I had taken the idea to other places and the quotes ranged from $200 to even $300. I ended up paying $140 plus tip at Electric Haven and had a great time chatting with the different employees and regulars while having it done. I have one back several times and each time they have been quick, talented and reasonable. Manny is the best! He knew exactly what I wanted and added a lot of creativity to it.

Definitely a misleading store. You will find no great deals and no low prices. I don't know how they can have such outrageous prices and expect to do much business in Arizona Mills Mall. The staff seem clueless and unmotivated.

Darn good Mexican food in huge portions and a reasonable price. Although the staff might not all speak fluent English, they're always polite. It's a family owned and operated business, too!
