The wait staff was very friendly, but our reservation for eight was taken in error for the back patio which can only accommodate 6 persons.    Regardless, they did get us setup in the front patio and comped the chips and guac.  Everyone said their food was delicious, but my short rib and my wife's chicken was very dry, good flavor, but dry.  They also had a service issue where 4 of the 8 people were served, and the other 4 were served also 10 minutes after.  I may go back in the future, but for the money, I wouldn't bring a large group there.

Great coffee and a good atmosphere. The also offer beer and wine making it a great place to grab a drink after work.  Dog friendly patio is always a bonus as well.

This company is a joke to work with.  They missed their first appointment to come out an do an estimate.    When the estimator did come to our home the following week, he was very pleasant and provided us with an acceptable quote that was agreed upon.  The estimator gave us a time window of 9:00 am - 10:00am for the following weekend and told us that we would receive a call the following business day to confirm, which it was.  Today, I placed a call to inquire the status of the arborist's arrival.  I was told that the crew wouldn't be available to arrive until 12:00pm or 1:00pm.  I was offered an additional 10% discount for the error in arrival which I agreed to.  At 1:30pm, I placed another call to inquire the status and was then told it would be another 45ish minutes.  At this point, I asked to cancel the service and the phone rep proceeded to tell me that they never make time commitments and that it should have never happened.  While I can certainly understand that this may be his policy, commitments were in-fact made by his staff and they were not met.  I don't think it's reasonable for any company to not give you a time window especially for a 6-7 hour job.  Even Cox and Qwest are able to give you a 4 hour window.  I will also say the Owner, Al your tree pal, did give me a call personally to find out how to retain our business.  He stated that he has been working in the Valley for over 30 years and this isn't how he runs his business.  While I can respect that, his company and crew have now wasted my time and had lost my business.  I declined to reconsider my cancellation.  There are too many other arborists' in town that I'm sure would be happy to take my money and provide me service in a timely fashion.  I would recommend to anyone that you stay away from this business.

My wife and I ate a Joey's on 10/15/11 and we were pretty disappointed.    My wife had a turkey sandwich, which she said was very dry and overall bland.  I had the Italian beef sandwich wet style, which there menu board stated was their specialty.  While the sandwich was very big, the bread had turned into a undercooked doughy consistency from the gravy.  The hot peppers where dull, and the sandwich on the whole need salt.  I will say the prices and service were pretty good, though the place was pretty empty.  I'm not an expert on Chicago style food, but I would say keep driving and go to Chicago Hamburger Company or Luke's of Chicago.

Poor service is the status quo at this place.  I came in and sat myself after standing in the door way for a couple of minutes. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to seat myself because no one was their nor was their any signage  to direct people.  I sat at the table and waited for 10 mins and one had even said hello or made any eye contact.  There was a person at the table next to me that was having the same issue.

Great selection of coffee and friendly customer service. Free WiFi and comfy chairs make this place a great addition to the neighborhood.

Hostesses here are difficult and make you feel unwelcome. They wouldn't let me sit at a patio table to enjoy a drink and an appetizer while the patio was 2/3 open tables. I had to promise to be no more than 30 minutes so that a 'real diner' could have the table instead.  Sorry for inconveniencing you Chelsea's Kitchen. Not to worry, we left after 30 minutes as promised for fear of being asked to leave if we ordered a second drink. For a place that doesn't take reservations, you would think they would allow a first come, first serve patron to enjoy their beautiful patio. Sadly, the hostess took the enjoyment out of a otherwise lovely Saturday afternoon. She could at least smile.
