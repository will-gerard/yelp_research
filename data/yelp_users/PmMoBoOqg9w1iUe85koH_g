Fun dive joint with surprisingly great food. Honestly, favorite chicken wings in town. They fry them, toss in sauce and then put em to the grill. It's the most amazing combination ever. Get your wings "the works," it's an insider flavor that's sweet and spicy. I get mine with a side of hot sauce cuz I love my wings spicy! They also have homemade ranch which is totally dope.

My favorite Thai joint in the Phoenix area.  Always fresh, always super friendly, and of course always consistently delicious. I love the ease and convenience of their drive thru window for pickups. Try the Coco Soup (chicken, fresh mushrooms, and a tangy coconut broth) and the spicy noodle! They also have an incredible Pad Thai (I order mine with tofu and chicken--if ordering to go, ask for crispy wontons). I've never tried a dish from here I didn't like but probably need to branch out more--I just can't get past how delicious my go-to's are!  Spice levels are traditionally Thai (meaning they don't mess around with spice)!   It's on the more expensive side for local Thai joints BUT you get what you pay for and you can just tell how fresh the ingredients are.   We love you SaiBai!

One of the worst locations. Haven't been in awhile so I went back and now I remember why. Staff is always rude and rushing you to order. If the sandwiches were good I would absolutely be able to overlook the miserable guy taking my order but they just aren't. Last time I ordered a simple turkey sandwich with a few add ons, they forgot the hot peppers--the pinnacle of my sandwich! The produce is bland and the bread was just, blah. Gross. Would not recommend this location.

Service was great. Food was just eh. Because I was so unimpressed by the food, I probably won't be back. Place was packed though so they must be doing something right.

Love this local pizza nook! Outstanding staff from the hostess to the servers, bartenders and even the guys making the pies-- they all care and make for a friendly, attentive, seamless dining experience. Try the chicken chop salad and the red sauce mushroom and funghi pizza.   Check it out. Awesome happy hour too. Keep doing what you're doing Nook!

My absolute favorite local spot! From the food to the service, ingos is top notch. Love how casual, relaxed, friendly and efficient the vibe is. When it comes to burgers, there is absolutely nothing better. Grass-fed meat melts in your mouth and is the absolute perfect size, never leaving you overly stuffed and bloated and instead always happy and satisfied.   Here are are my go-to's but you CANNOT go wrong. Drink: Greyhound (MUST) Apps: crudit√©s (fresh heirloom veggies with homemade hummus and pumpkinseed dip-- I told you I was a regular) and shattered potato chips (ask for a side of homemade hot sauce). Burger: Farmers daughter with an egg or any burger with an egg! Crispy Chicken sandwich or tuna burger mmm! Oh yeah chicken and waffles are to die!   INGO on!

Amazingly delicious food. Fresh ingredients, happy friendly staff. Goes to show how fresh organic, healthy food can never go wrong. Cool concept. Scenes a little yuppie  (But that's ok!) and prices are pretty steep-- again, fresh produce is expensive.   The manager (I think he's the manager) gave my niece a flower (such a nice gesture) and was so lovely to us and the entire room (staff like that really set the tone for a great dining experience).  If you're looking for quality food, friendly service and are not too concerned about price, Flower Child is DOPE. Get the vegan caesar with chicken or the flying avocado wrap (delicious).   You'll leave this place happy and not overstuffed.

The bee's knees. This hidden gem makes me want to take my pants off (in a good way). Service is outstanding, meat candy (Sriracha bacon), bloody Mary's and their RANCH (ahmahgah).   Get the Spanglish, Cubano and try their beer pairings. You haven't made it to this place, you're a fool. Did I mention their ranch... TO. DIE! I also want to try their philly.   Thanks, BRI!
