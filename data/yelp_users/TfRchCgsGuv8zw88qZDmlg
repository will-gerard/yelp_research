I have been in the service industry for 7 years, so I give a lot of leeway to servers/bartenders, but this last visit was ridiculous... First off, It took the bartender about 10 minutes to get to me because she was on the phone, she then proceeded to take my order while on the phone, which would not be a big deal if she didn't roll her eyes as if I was inconveniencing her by potentially giving 5-10 dollars to open a couple beers, on top of that she made us cash out drink by drink, rather than open a tab.  Later after 4 beers a piece me and my friends got kicked out for not tipping her on the last round because the service sucked she threatened to call the cops, so we went outside waiting for a cab, she came out and said she was calling the cops again (this was all because she didn't get a tip on the last round). Nobody was out of line, she was mad that we were not happy with the service.  The worst part is I have said multiple times I'm not coming back here because of this bartender, but I keep coming back because all of the other bartenders are great.  If the owner is reading this I would give him one piece of advice... Just because someone has worked for you for 20 years doesn't mean she is making you money, the bar was dead for a reason and you need to take a hint, aka the bar doesn't make money when bad employees chase it all away.

These guys are awesome if you treat them with respect, because they are busy and deal with a lot, as long as you treat the bartenders with respect they will reciprocate.. I left a bad review before and I regret it every day I come back... Just act like you wanna be treated and the bartenders will be the same way.
