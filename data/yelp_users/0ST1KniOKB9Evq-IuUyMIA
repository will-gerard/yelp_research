I love this place! Cheap, super accommodating and friendly staff-plus they do a great job. They only take cash and English is rarely spoken but where else can you get a detail for under $50?

For fast food, these guys make a great burger--no joke! Great service too, so polite. Check it out...just make sure you bring cash cause BF is not taking your plastic.

Charlie's Taco Stand  Not talking about the bar but the taco stand behind the bar. Now before you exit out of this review, hear me out. This place by far serves the BEST TACOS in town--hands down! Ingredients are fresh, servings are plentiful and prices cheap. Order the mini-quesadillas, the perfect combination of crunch and flavor.   Be warned--word has caught on to this place, it's common to stand in line for up to an hour. The earlier you go, the better. Otherwise you might just be standing behind a group of drunk boys reminiscing about their night.

Not gonna lie--when America's Taco Shop opened right down the road, I really thought this little local take-out place would quickly go out of business. I was gladly mistaken.  No frills Mexican food. Expect your sit down meal to include plastic forks and paper plates--but if you're looking for good Mexican food at a great price...YUM! Good service too.  #11 with an  enchilada $4.65  :)

Big fan of this place, one of my  happy hour hangouts. The food is good, try their mechaca and shredded tacos. Their house margaritas are strong and tasty.  It looks alittle dive but still attracts a large following and is a local favorite in the area,  Great bartender-Daniel will take good care of you. Overall, a great family restaurant!

I'm a regular here for a reason. The coffee and pastries are great and service always friendly. Sure the place is full of hipsters on their Macs but I see all kinds of people here, never snobberish. Can get loud and people get way too comfortable at times (get your feet off the table) but overall...great place.

When I'm looking for the more mature, laid back version of Lux, I come to Copper Star. Coffee is not as good but service is great and place is inviting. Great neighborhood favorite.

I used to go to Ticoz all the time. The burgers are great and drinks incredible but it was the service that made this place stand out. The wait staff and bartenders were great! Now with their new owner I've noticed a lot of changes. Valet (don't know if that's actually necessary but ok), changes in their menu and higher prices. I'm fine with all of that but what I can't get over is how awful service has become there. With the exception of the blonde bartender (sorry I forgot her name, thanks for the strong drinks btw), the service is mediocre. The last two times I've gone there, friends I took who are not regulars even commented on the poor service.  I hear their profits have gone up since they've changed ownership. That's fine but unfortunately, they lost me as a customer.

One of my favorite places to eat. Great ambiance-cozy but friendly and laid back. Food is incredible! I've been coming here for over 6 yrs and never left dissatisfied. If you want quality New Mexican cuisine, or just looking for a small, cool place to eat, find Dick's. It's the brown door without a sign.

I really don't know how anyone can be impressed with this place. The ambiance is actually pretty cheap and contrived. And while I've heard it's a pretty decent place for lunch, I can't recommend it for dinner.   To start off, we ordered the feta bruschetta which I thought was actually tasty but my friends thought it was too strong. Then came our entrees.   1.Chicken Provencal with Greek potatoes--good.  2. Bistro beef tenders with Greek potatoes and asparagus. My potatoes were decent but not great, the asparagus was cooked perfectly. The beef tenders were horrible--the meat seemed like it had been BROILED...totally lacked flavor. I didn't finish it.  3.Lastly my other friend ordered the tuna. Having worked the industry for years and owned a deli at one time. she remarked that she could tell the ingredients weren't  fresh. After one bite, she refused to finish it. She politely asked the waiter for the Provencal Chicken. What was brought instead was a reheated lunch panani chicken breast.   If you want ambiance go to Coronado Cafe down the road or better yet House of Tricks, Cibo. If you want quality food; fortunately the Phoenix area has many other places that out do La Piccola Cucina in price and quality. Luckily for us.

Stay away...this comedy ensemble is anything BUT funny! The Trifecta show was horrible, thankfully the last act kept me from walking out. Waste of $10. My friend sent me a txt halfway through it...."I need to go to the bathroom...Hula's bathroom". That's the restaurant across the street.  Best laugh I had all night

Wow, worse service ever!  My girlfriend and I went there on Sunday morning. We traditionally frequent different coffee shops during the weekend and looked forward to their good coffee and crepes. I love the screen door and intimate feel of the place, so relaxing.  So we arrived and sat down, only to wait for 15 minutes (not an exaggeration) before we decided to leave. The barista didn't even acknowledge us until half way through that time. It would be different if it was screaming busy  but there was only two other couples sitting down ahead of us. I spend alot of time in coffee shops, this place may have good coffee but compared to service at Lux and Lola's; I'll take my business elsewhere in the future.
