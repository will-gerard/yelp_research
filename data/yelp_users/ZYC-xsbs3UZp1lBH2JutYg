Einstein Bros at Rural and University has been so generous with the nonprofit organization I work. They've donated snacks for our volunteers for years, and each time they are so easy to work with and provide more than enough to keep our volunteers happy.   When I stop in as a customer, the staff is consistently friendly and the food is consistently fresh and good. Mmm, I'm going to have to go get a pumpkin bagel with pumpkin schmear now...

Yes. Yes. A thousand times yes.  Some of my non-stand-bys are hit-or-miss, but this is the perfect comfort food for anyone on the meat-eating spectrum.   Note: do not read "vegan" as "healthy". It's comfort food, which means in all likelihood it is greasy, cheezy (with a z because it's not real cheese), and food-coma-inducing.  Maybe I'm crazy, but I think the staff here is nicer than at the Scottsdale location.  You can easily drop $15 on a casual meal/drink/add-ons, which is my only beef (ba-dum-CHA) with this place. Ingredients are good, and the "meat" is all made in-house (none of that weird packaged, preservative stuff), so I don't think it's totally unreasonable. This place has a cult following and national veg cred for a reason.  HITS Original G Po Boy Big Wac No Harm Chicken Parm Cole slaw (peanut - can get it as a side with most sandwiches) Drunken Mongolian bowl Vegan Wings Peanut Tofu Chili fries Eggless rolls Mac and cheese (on the kids menu... try it WITH the wings. Uh-ma-zing.) Chicken tenders (also kids menu)  If there's a special, always get it, because 90% of the time, it will be your new favorite.

Stopped by America's for 2 bean burritos to go: an XL America's and Terry's way; and a reg America's way, plus pineapple and no cheese.  First attempt: XL perfect but reg burrito has beans only. I'd just eat it, but it's like $1.50 to add anything on (which, btw, is nuts for like a tablespoon of diced jalapenos.) Second attempt: guy at register is super nice, confirms order (America's way, pineapple, no cheese) before putting the order in again. Burrito has jalapenos and pineapple... and cheese. Gave up.  I don't know, maybe just don't get food to go?  Total for 2 bean burritos (including tax/tip): $16 and change  Come on.
