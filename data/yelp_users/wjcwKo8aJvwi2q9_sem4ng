If I could give ZERO stars I would. I just moved to this area from Ahwatukee and this is my second time coming to this location and THEY ARE THE WORSE. The last time I came for an oil change they told me it was a three hour wait. Today he told me I had 10 people in front of me. I spoke to this Derrick guy and he's rude and unprofessional and lazy. He gave me every reason in the world for why I should come back, why I should leave my car or why it's not good to come on Saturday. I kept saying to him "I need an oil change" like regardless of what ur saying I still need an oil change. When I was in Ahwatukee I purchased this "Family Plan" that gives you so many free oil changes and discounts etc.  That was great when I lived in Ahwatukee because the Fletcher's out there was AWESOME. However here. I hate it. If I it wasn't for the "Family Plan" I wouldn't ever come here for service. Ever. As soon as this runs out I will never return. Horrible horrible place and horrible staff.

I don't know if it was just a bad day or a bad waiter but I didn't enjoy my visit. Arrived for lunch at 1:26pm and was seated immediately. My fianc√© and I ordered an Ahi Tuna Salad and it came out within 10 minutes. We ordered our entrees (crab stuffed Tilapia) when we received the appetizer. We sat and sat and sat. We were talking and when we realized we didn't have out food we called the waiter (who never came to the table after seating us and delivering the appetizers) he said the food was just done and coming out. An hour later. Needless to say the food was cold which means it was done and left sitting and the waiter didn't provide prompt service. I'm sorry we won't be coming back here. Very bad experience.

I have lived here for less then a year and I have had over 5 maintenance requests for the same issue.  I have an electrical fire in my apartment due to faulty wiring from this development and they were the worst at handling the situation.  I wasn't comfortable living in the unit and requested to be moved to another unit and they wanted to charge me over $1500.00 to move.  No courtesy at all. I asked them about replacing the food that went bad in my fridge after the fire and the manager told me that the power wasn't off that long and they moved my food to another unit's fridge so I shouldn't have any wasted food.  The apartments are old, the appliances are old and they aren't very nice compared to other communities in the area.  I am moving and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.

I am big on piercings and I am equally as big on cleanliness, professionalism and reputaion.  I am from Philadelphia and in all my years of getting pierced I have always gone to ONE piercer.    When I moved to Arizona I decided to only get pierced when I went home to visit because I knew and trusted my piercer.  My girlfriend suggested HTC to me because she knew how picky I am about who does my body art and she said that they were really clean.    My first visit there was for my daughter's 16th birtday. I allowed her to get a belly button piercing. I have to say that I was impressed with the clean space, the professional staff and the way that the piercers carried themselves.  I liked the prices and the fact that they didn't try to charge you for every little thing,  My daughter got pierced and is happily healed with no complications.   I went back yesterday to get my lip pierced (times 2) and my piercer was Kevin. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that not only had Kevin lived in Philadelphia but that he also knew my piercer from Philly personally and they had worked together.  How ironic is that? When I say this place is clean...whew. When you come in you see a sign that says that you can't even change your OWN piercings in the shop. They would do it for free.  I went to get pierced and Kevin changed his gloves at LEAST 4 times: 1, to prep the station, 2 to mark my piercings up, 3, to open the sterile tools and the 4th was to pierce. I LOVED IT. He spent time just talking (I think it's to relax you) and he was sooo funny.  He kept singing responses to questions and conversation I mean he was the best and I was completely relaxed.  I didn't once have to think about if they were clean and sanitary. I am really impressed.  Needless to say I now have Kevin and HTC in my phone as my piercer.   If you want a clean, professional, personable place to get your body art I suggest you make it to HTC TEMPE and see Kevin.

This is a very classy and trendy restaurant. I am here with my girlfriend and we didn't wait more then 5 minutes before being seated even though there was a very packed house. The waiter Thom was very polite an attentive and the food was phenomenal. I will definitely return.

Not happy. Came in with my daughter who had extreme pain and swelling in both legs. They didn't register her and then they kept us waiting for an hour. When asked I was told they have a "call ahead" system so some others are ahead of me. Really? Since when was urgent medical care taking reservations? I would do better to go into the ER. I think I will bypass this place in the future.
