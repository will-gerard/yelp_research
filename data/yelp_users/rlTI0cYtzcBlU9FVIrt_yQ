Some co-workers and I went to this Applebee's for lunch before an afternoon of meetings. We arrived there a little after 11. There were maybe 3 other tables occupied.  We ordered salads, soups, a sandwich and a chicken breast meal.    The waiter was good. However, we had to wait an extremely long time to get our food. We were worried we would be late for our meeting. We actually paid for our food before we got it! We asked the man who sat us if he could check on our food because we were going to be late for our meeting. His response was that he has no control over what time the food will come out. I thought that was a little rude.  When I finally got my Caesar salad the lettuce was warm there were maybe two pieces of chicken on it and hardly any dressing. My friend also didn't have enough dressing for her salad. So we had to ask for more dressing and had to wait another 10 minutes before we got it. The potato soup I got was very good. By the time we left it was 12:15 and we all had to rush to our meeting.  I don't think I'll be going back to Applebees. I was not very happy with the food and the wait and the response I got from the host.

My first visit with Dr. Divine was good. He was very attentive, answered my questions and was thorough. Then I got the bill for a couple hundred dollars. I was charged for every single thing we talked about. This happened every time I went there for months. I asked a lady at the front desk for an itemized bill and asked her to explain it to me. She had no idea what half the charges were for. The last straw was when I needed a refill and my pharmacy tried calling 3 times and this office never got back to them. I was a week late for taking a medicine that I CANNOT miss. Then when I got the refill, the dosage was wrong. You would think a doctor would know how dangerous this is. I'm never going back.

I absolutely love this dentist office! The building itself is so adorable and cozy that you feel right at home. Everyone I have come in contact with has been ridiculously nice and welcoming.   The dentist Dr. Chase is amazing as well. I was told at a different dentist office that I needed $5,000 worth of dental work done. I questioned it because I wasn't in pain at all and I take care of my teeth. I'm so thankful that I found this office. Dr. Chase told me that I didn't need all the work done that the other dentist had quoted me. I appreciated the honesty I received from this office.  I'm so happy with my dentist and I recommend him to everyone.

This was my second time ordering take out from here. Both times I had bad experiences. I'm done with Streets of New York.   Both times the delivery took about an hour and 15 minutes. I understand they were busy. However, when my food got here, it was cold and the ice cream was completely melted. Both times the delivery guy said they were lost in my apartment complex and they had to "walk all over". There's a map in the front of every apartment complex.   This time I ordered a pepperoni calzone. Besides being cold, it had a really funny taste. Also, the pepperoni were stacked together in 2 places inside. There were literally 6 pepperoni stacked up. I didn't even eat it.   The cookie dessert I got was burnt and the ice cream for the top was completely melted. I'm so disappointed in Streets of New York.

My family and I have been going to Pullanos for years now! I used to drive from Scottsdale just to get their wings. They are still just as great I remember!  I usually get a sausage pizza and medium and honey bbq wings. Their wings are absolutely to die for! They are by far the best wings I've had.   Their pizza is amazing as well. The sausage is Italian style sausage and they put lots of cheese on their pizza. My son likes the spaghetti and meat sauce.   I've never had anything from Pullanos that I didn't like. The staff of friendly and it's a comfortable atmosphere.

I've been to Lavendar's a few times. My first two experiences were ok. My last experience upset me enough to not go back.   They offer a gift certificate special every so often, $60 gift certificate for $30. Well, I arranged a massage package with a deep tissue, aromatherapy, and reflexology. Well, I never got the reflexology and the "aromatherapy" was shoving a scented tissue under the face part of the massage table. The masseuse was good.  When I went to pay, the guy told me I couldn't use my gift certificate on packages! No where on the certificate or on the website does it say that! He said "well, it's posted right here." A little sign on a table in the waiting room. I was charged for everything separately and ended up spending much more money.   The customer service was horrible. The people at the front desk weren't friendly and didn't want to help you at all.

Why haven't i tried The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf before? All this time I've been a Starbucks girl. Well, not anymore!  So, let me tell you about the day that changed my coffee consuming life. I got dragged here by a friend. Reluctantly, i ordered a white chocolate latte (the closest thing they had to Starbucks white mocha) and a raisin bran muffin. My first drink was like tasting a little bit of heaven. I was sure that angels themselves made my drink. The smooth, decadent coffee concoction was unbelievable! I was hooked.  The bran muffin was amazing too. It's a moist muffin coated on top with honey and raisins. It's a huge muffin, so it's plenty to share.   The only reason I gave them 4 stars is because they tend to run out of things and they don't get shipments every day. I've been a couple times when they were out of muffins.   The prices are really not that different from Starbucks. The coffee itself is so much better, that it's worth the money. Plus I've never waited longer than a couple minutes in line, whereas at Starbucks the wait is pretty long.

I don't even want to give 1 star!    I've taken my son here 3 times. There is such an uncomfortable atmosphere there, unless you're a personal friend of theirs. They barely acknowledge you as you walk in. That's just the beginning.    The first time the owner was the one to cut my son's hair.  He was ok, I wasn't impressed. But, since my son got to watch cartoons on the little tvs, he wanted to go back. (Kids priorities.)  The second person to cut my son's hair was an older woman. I could tell she was new. She didn't have a clue what a fade was. She kept saying "like a faux hawk". I said "no it's not" and kept explaining. Well guess what my son ended up getting? A faux hawk. Ugh!   The last time was the last straw. We walked in, no appointment. I expected to wait. We waited 20 minutes. Finally the owner was done. He said (after 20 minutes of sitting there waiting) "who are you waiting for?" I asked if he would be able to do my son's hair since he's done. He told me "no, I have an appointment in 10 minutes and I have to eat." I waited another 10 minutes for someone to be done. (It seemed everyone was busy talking with each other rather than going their job). The owner comes out from the back and looks at me. He said " well, my appointment is late so I'll take him now". He did a horrible, quick job. He cut my son's hair in about 5 minutes. It was the worst cut he's ever had.   I will never go back.

I went to this office because some family members went there. I liked that there was an on-site lab, chiropractic care upstairs and an x-ray facility in the same building.   Well, it started about a year ago when I called to make an appointment. I'm a teacher, so as you can imagine, I get sick frequently. I was told there were no appointments available for 2 days. I thought that was odd, but figured it was flu season. Well, since then I have NEVER been able to make a same day or even next day appointment. I've had to go to urgent care numerous times because I was so sick and couldn't get into my own dr.   How can you be a Dr's office and not have same day sick appointments? I think this office is much more concerned with money than with actually helping patients. I will be finding a new office.

My son had a bad experience here. He was 4 when he started. He liked it at first, but then he didn't want to go and would cry if I took him. He couldn't understand what the master was saying to him and the master would clearly get frustrated with him. When my son didn't want to go back, they still tried to withdraw money from my account for months. The communication is horrible.

My son and I love this dentist's office! We've been going here for 2 years now. My son actually looks forward to going to the dentist! It was important to me to find a great dentist to give my son a good first impression of dental care. This office definitely did that and so much more!  The entire staff is always so pleasant and cheerful when I see them. My son had a small cavity, and being the over-protective mom I am, I was really nervous about him going back without me. I expressed my concerns and they immediately took me back to the room with them and reassured me.   I've recommended this office to many people and will continue to do so.

I took my furry baby girl (kitten) to get spayed last week. I had a wonderful experience from the time I called to schedule the appointment to when I picked her up.  When I called, I got an appointment on the only day that worked for my schedule. I had called many vets, and not one could get us in in less than a month. The guy who answered the phone was awesome and answered all of my questions.   When I got there, everyone I encountered was very friendly. The Vet was great. He was very thorough. They called me to tell me when my kitty-girl was out of surgery.   I'm very happy I entrusted Paws with my furry baby. It's worth the 25 minute drive. Thank you,  Paws!

I love Jersey Mikes! I usually get the Italian sub, and it's amazing! I also got the Philly Cheesesteak and it was the sooooo good! They are friendly whenever I go in. I do think it's a little pricey, but way better quality than Subway.

I love this place! I went to it once before years ago before Lindsey took over. I didn't have a good experience then. Since Lindsay has had it, it's awesome! Everyone there does a great job. Lindsay is who does my nails and she always has great ideas for me to try. I can usually get in the same day when I call. They do get busy on the weekends so I would call first. The spa pedicure chairs are awesome! They have a huge variety of nail powders, gel colors and tips. They are very clean. I've been going for a while and I've never had any problems. This is the only place I'll go to now.

If you have not been to Dutch Bros. yet, stop what you're doing right now and get there! This place is amazing! Don't be intimidated by the line of cars. There is always a line but it goes fast and it's totally worth it! Not only is everything there phenomenal, the service is unbelievable! My son says "I think you have to be so cool and nice to work there!" This is the only coffee shop I go to now. Love love love Dutch Bros!

I love this place! I usually get the veggie burrito. It's amazing! It's a little pricey if you ask me, but the burritos are big enough to split out save for later. I like the "flight" option. You get a drink, chips and salsa and a tapa. It's a small drive thru place, so it's great for grabbing something quick. They use very fresh ingredients.
