Before I was referred to Ben by my Naturopathic Doctor, I was fat, sick, tired and at a loss for what to do next. I knew I needed more than just a trainer - I needed someone that understood and could evaluate my overall health and lifestyle. He evaluated my blood work, adjusted my supplement plan, and dug deep into my diet, sleep habits and stress triggers.  His approach is highly individualized and very different than a typical trainer that will just crush you in the gym. He focuses on healing the body first so that you can handle the activity required to build muscle and burn fat. Sure, I still have a long way to go but I can honestly say that a couple months in to my program, I felt healthy, refreshed, and stronger! Fast forward three years: I feel heathy (my blood work agrees), have great energy, and I am stronger than I have ever been. Oh and by the way, he is great at crushing my in the gym....but my body can handle it and my recovery is great.   You won't find anyone that is more qualified and educated to address any need: fat loss, overall wellness, or performance. I could go on and on but I think you get my point....

I have been treated by Dr. Boothe for almost 2 years. I have been going to Chiropractors my entire life and can honestly say, he is the best. When it comes to helping me heal from a injury or just keeping me aligned, he provides TOP NOTCH care and takes his time to understand what is going on. In fact, I tore my MCL last summer and his treatment plan got me to 100% in just 3 month (i'm not kidding).   Yes, he is excellent at sport injury care but he now treats my entire family. My wife and kids (3 1/2 yo. and 18 mo. daughters) love going to see Dr. Boothe!
