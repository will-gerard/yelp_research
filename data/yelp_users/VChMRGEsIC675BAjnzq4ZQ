Having just moved into the neighborhood, we ventured to try Bamboo House, hoping to find a close place to get our Chinese fix. Unfortunately, on our visit, B.H. did not live up to the hype. My boyfriend put it very succinctly: "There wasn't anything wrong with the rice." We ordered meat dumplings, orange chicken and garlic chicken. The meat dumplings were no frills, basically barely seasoned meat stuffed into wrappers and then fried. The orange chicken was passable, but nothing special (I think Panda Express does better, and I loathe that place). The garlic chicken was a spicy, sodden mess, barely edible. As if this wasn't disappointing enough, my hot tea was weak, vaguely honey flavored water. His iced tea appeared to be the same tea poured over ice. But, at least the rice was okay, right?

We're currently one third of the way through our lease and I cannot wait to move out of this place. The property looks nice enough and the grounds are well kept, but our experience here has been lackluster at best.  The staff is rude, for starters. They don't handle complaints in a gracious or timely fashion. We had an issue with a drawer in the kitchen that kept tipping in. They came out five times before I gave up on that. Yes, it sucks, but that's par for the course here.   Last Monday, something caused a flood in the bathroom/hallway/kitchen area after hours. It took the on-call maintenance guy over an hour to arrive, and he couldn't find the source of the flood, which had thankfully stopped at this point. The carpet person arrived another ninety minutes later, ripped up the carpet, sucked up the water and set up a large fan. By Thursday, I was asking the office when they would be replacing said damaged carpet. They told me that they would just be cleaning it and not replacing it. They also said that I told them the source of the flood was the second bathroom's toilet (I did, really? It's good to know I live in Imagination Land.) On Friday, I went into the office again, and they told me they'd be out to clean it that day. Right around closing time, the carpet person's assistant showed up, removed the fan, and did no cleaning or tacking down of the carpet. He said he didn't know he was supposed to do those things and didn't have the materials to do so. Finally, eight days later, they have tacked down and cleaned the carpet, after much nagging by me. I have never had to work so hard to get basic service from an apartment complex.  In addition, they do not keep track of packages in the office consistently, and I have had mail go missing on more than one occasion.  They also roll water and sewer into your rent price. They recently raised this, so our rent went up, mid-lease. I am disturbed by the fact that they can change what we pay pretty much whenever they like.  Pros: - Close to shopping and grocery stores. - Easy to get in and out of. - Relatively quiet.  Cons: - Rude, non-responsive - Things don't get fixed properly. - Price may change.  EDIT: The complex changed ownership at the end of my lease, so this review may be completely outdated at this point.

Let me preface this by saying that I've never been a big fan of chain Mexican restaurants. My sister loves Macayo's for some mysterious reason, and I decided to play along since we had relatives visiting from out of state.  The decor is nauseating. It feels like they took the most obnoxious colors they could find and ratcheted it up on the scale of tacky. However, we came to eat, so who cares what color the walls are?  The salsa is thin, but tolerable. Nothing special, but I'm always a fan of bottomless chips, so I'll take it.  Everyone else seemed to like their food. I ordered tamales with green sauce. Unfortunately, the first time it came with their "Baja sauce," which our waitress informed us is cream cheese, heavy whipping cream and jalapeño juice. She quickly took it back and brought out my correct order. Much to my surprise, green sauce is just red sauce with green chiles in it. At this point, I had fallen behind enough that I scraped most of the sauce to the side and ate my lunch. The tamales had a nice fluffy texture, but the sauce was not what I had in mind.  Our waitress did handle my sending back the order without any fuss. She was gracious and attentive, so for that I'm adding in an extra star.

Defalco's is amazingly delicious. The trick to getting your lunch in a timely fashion is to call ahead. It's usually ready in about fifteen minutes and you get to skip the line (as pickups are a separate cashier).  The cheesesteaks are phenomenally sinful, whether you go with the beef or the chicken. I try to eat healthily, but even I will admit weakness when faced with Defalco's. I'd like to see you resist once you have tasted their heavenly precursor to a heart attack, err, cheesesteak.  Also, don't skip dessert. The cannoli is epic.  If you want to eat in, there are tables along the windows. The grocery also has a good selection of Italian dry goods if you want to do something crazy like cook at home.

I come to this Best Buy when Fry's Electronics is out of stock of something I am looking for (or on the rare occasion that something is cheaper here). It is relatively clean, but I find that the people who work here are incredibly uninformed and do not communicate with one another.  Today, I went in for a replacement phone charger because I had a blonde moment and left it somewhere where I won't be able to retrieve it for a week. Now, I know that my phone is micro USB, so this shouldn't be challenging, right?   Me: "This one should work, correct?"  Overenthusiastic Teen Employee: "Umm, I dunno. It is a different brand and your phone is pretty new." *hopeful smile*  She runs off to confer with her other employees, who are lounging haphazardly around the mobile accessories area (must be nice). She comes back and picks up a car charger. I shake my head and remind her that I am looking for a wall adapter. We go though this a couple of times, but eventually, I just go with my gut.    Overenthusiastic Teen Employee: "Oh, those are on sale, two for $29.99." *points to sign*  Me: "I only need one. Then again, I might have another stroke of genius, so maybe I will keep one at work." (Yeah, she got me.)  So, I bop around the store, but don't find anything else that I'm terribly interested in. I make my way to the register and go through checkout.  Unsurprisingly, the sale did not ring up. I mention this to the clerk, who radios in the query. A few minutes go by without response and she asks again. I know that there are three people standing in mobile accessories, but at this point, I tell her to forget it and just go with the original one I came in for.   This is not the first time I have encountered price discrepancies and lack of communication at this particular location. I remain unimpressed and will only stop in here if I absolutely need to.

Of all of the Flo's restaurants in the Valley, the McDowell Mountain Village location is my favorite. It's located on the northeast corner in the same plaza as AJ's, so parking can be a bit trying during peak eating times.  I've never been disappointed with the food at Flo's. It's easily the best affordable Chinese food here and even rivals some of the best places in the Bay area. My personal favorite is the lemon pepper chicken, which is delicately tart. The kung pao is also pretty fantastic. No matter where you go on the menu, it's hard to go wrong here.  One of the best things about Flo's is that you can substitute tofu into any of the menu items, or ratchet up the spiciness with no fuss by the staff. It's refreshing that they're so accommodating.  Prices are normally pretty reasonable, especially given what you're getting. Dinner is in the $10-15 range for the most part. However, on Saturdays, Flo's runs a crazy lunch special from noon to three: $5 lunch! For five little Washingtons, you get a nommy house salad (with a tart herb dressing), crackalicious won tons and your choice of entree with rice. Even at lunch portions, it's still a good amount of food. I typically take half home with me. The rest of the week, most of the lunch menu is $7, which is still a steal. Happy hour (half priced drinks and appetizers) is on weekday afternoons from three to seven.  There is typically a short wait for lunch at Flo's, but service is quick and efficient. The restaurant is always clean, and although it can get noisy at lunchtime, I have never found it difficult to carry on a conversation here.

I honestly don't know how I haven't reviewed this place yet. I have clearly been lax in my obligations to Yelpers everywhere.  Souvia is a lovely place to have informal tea with friends. You can order a pot to have in house or tea to go. Loose tea is also available for purchase, in addition to a small rotating selection of pastries.  There is a tea of the month selection (I have a secret love for the October one because there are cat and bat sprinkles in it. Shut up. I can be five if I want to be.). The also have featured teas of the day that you can sample (and are discounted if you purchase loose tea on the day that they are featured).  If you decide to have a pot of tea, you can buy 250g of that same tea for 20%. If you don't feel like tasting before you buy (or you've reached your tea threshold), you can sniff any of their hundreds of teas for free. Yes, free smells, folks.  Although I live a good hour away, trips to Souvia are always worth the drive. Service is generally friendly, and the atmosphere is quiet (unless I am there with friends, we are a little noisier than your average tea-goer).

I wanted to love this place as it's adorable and tucked into a corner at Harper's Nursery. The gentleman staffing the bar seemed a bit gruff, but a good caffeine fix will help me forgive even the orneriest grump.  That being said, my iced mocha was among the worst I have ever experienced. It was bitter and full of grounds. A few sips turned my stomach. This will definitely not be a repeat for me, no matter how many times I wants to skip about the lovely plants at Harper's.

I had a customized organic facial with Angella T. and I couldn't be more delighted. I had no trouble booking my Groupon appointment and the ladies at the front desk gave me top notch service from the moment I called until I left post-appointment.   My facial was comforting and fun at the same time. I left refreshed and silky smooth. I would highly recommend this location and am already plotting out what other services I would like to try!  My skin is certainly much improved from its winter sadness and I feel quite a bit less like a Scaleysaurus Rex.

I adore the fact that this place popped up around the corner from our new apartment! The staff is incredibly friendly and always ready with a recommendation for the indecisive coffee aficionado. Their iced drinks are huge (a must for the scorching Phoenix summers) and everything is delicious.  The tea smoothies are made with a premix, but are quite refreshing.   They have breakfast sandwiches, pastries, soup as well as lunch sandwiches. The breakfast sandwiches (we have had vegetarian and the ham) are served on flaky croissants and are very good. If you get egg salad, be warned, it is messy!  Another bonus is that they get their coffee and tea locally.  You can get a drink punch card too, which they will keep on file for your visits. I could continue to ramble as there are so many lovable things about True Brew, but instead I will just tell you to try it for yourself.

Even though I had been in California for the last two years, the ladies at True Brew remembered me when I popped in for a caffeine fix last weekend (perhaps this is a sign that I may have been here a wee bit too often). Even better, my drink card was still on file (wish they would have told me that they knew I would be back). My espresso was every bit as delightful as I remember, and the owners just as personable. I am going to keep introducing my friends to this lovely shop so that it will always be available to me. Selfish, I know!

Pita Jungle has become the place that all of my friends from out of town demand that we eat at when they visit. Sometimes, there is a bit of a wait - I guess Yelp is cluing people in.   The menu is primarily Mediterranean inspired, but there is definitely something for everyone. Price-wise, it's really affordable, especially given that the portions are huge. I always take half of my meal home. Leftovers never tasted so good!  The jalapeño cilantro hummus is ridiculously delicious, but you may need extra pita unless you really load it up. There's even a tapas happy hour ($1!) Monday through Friday, 3-5pm, and a reverse happy hour 9pm-close.   I could probably fill up on the appetizers alone, but the entrees are great too. My old standby is the Lavosh Schwarma Wrap, which is stuffed full of chicken, hummus and veggies and served with a Greek salad. Thankfully, they cut the wrap in half, because there is no way I could eat that monster in one sitting.  In addition to the fantastic food, service is always friendly and attentive. I might have more than a little crush on this place. How'd you guess?

We went to Jasper's Peak courtesy of a Groupon my companion picked up. I'm fairly glad we didn't pay full price considering how disappointed I was with our experience this evening.  We ordered the crab dip, the voodoo chicken (with added shrimp), and the jambalaya.   The crab dip ($9) had a nice texture (not too wet), but didn't have a distinctive flavor. We doused this liberally with hot sauce, which was a significant improvement. It was served with blue corn tortilla chips, which provided a good contrast with our spiced up version.  The voodoo chicken ($16) had a delicious smokiness to it, and the shrimp (4 for an additional $4.50) were a nice complement. The jambalaya ($16) was weak, thin and not terribly filling. The rice was the best part of the jambalaya as it had time to soak up the sauce, which brings me to my next point.  The meats were all nicely done, but it was obvious that they were cooked separately outside of their sauces and assembled later. They were a bit bland unless you were certain that you rolled them about in your sauce.   The service could have been significantly better. Our water glasses were often empty for long stretches, and our waitress Rebecca's friendliness seemed forced and artificial. The place was fairly dead, but we weren't checked on until our meals were almost finished. She asked how our food was at that point but didn't even wait for my answer before she walked away. Service was fairly slow throughout the meal, even though I could see our plates waiting on the service counter.  I wanted to love this place as it is far closer to me than Baby Kay's, but I'm not going to settle for such poor service at this price.  Also, the bartender seemed very friendly, guiding the gentleman at the table next to us through a tasting in order for him to make a wine selection. We didn't drink tonight, but I was impressed.  Pros: - Quiet. - Large patio area. - Clean.  Cons: - No reservation for parties fewer than six. - Service can be spotty.

I was rather excited to get treated to a bit of pampering last weekend as I have been quite a stress bunny lately. Just Relax seemed promising enough and reasonably priced.   We arrived a little early for our appointment, so we waited in the lobby area. The couches were rather firm, but I suppose they didn't want people to get too comfortable before things even began. I was a little annoyed by the disarray in the waiting area: scattered magazines and a humongous tray covered in assorted cheap hard candies were a little distracting (to me, at least). I like my massage waiting rooms to feel a little more zen, but I figured that this is generally a non-existent issue for most people.  We were shown back to a shared room. I was delighted by the warmth of the foot bath, but that was pretty much where the joy ended for me on this trip. My masseuse might have still been training, I think. Although the primary focus of the massage was feet and calves, the masseuse did spend some time on my scalp as well as hands.  The scalp massage was incredibly irritating. My hair is short, and I swear he was scratching my head like I was a dog. I snuck a peek over at my companion and he appeared to be getting luxurious strokes on his head. What the heck? It's a good thing they covered my eyes with a warm towel or I might have spent more time stealing envious glances at his massage.  My masseuse continued to be brutal throughout the appointment. Granted, I can be a bit rough and tumble, but wow, I ended up with some serious bruising later on. In addition, I was rather perturbed by his continual whispering (I think he was getting a bit of on the spot coaching) throughout the appointment. I am all for on the job learning, but there should be some sort of warning to the client if the masseuse is still in training. I would have probably opted out.  In addition, the tops of the rooms are open, so any noise is carried across from the lobby into the massage areas. One of the appointments after ours was a rather talkative fellow. It was incredibly jarring.  I will admit that I felt much less tense a few hours later, so clearly the massage was effective. However, my overall experience could have been much better.

After seeing such glowing reviews, we had no hesitation heading over here for post-dinner caffeination. We ordered a dirty chai and a skim latte. Sadly, the espresso is overroasted and lackluster. I didn't make it past the first few desperate sips. I rarely turn away espresso, but even I can't stomach a burned, watery latte. The chai was overly sweet and unbalanced as well. I wanted to like this place as it has a charming atmosphere, but I don't think I will be back.

This is quite possibly the rudest optical shop I have ever set foot in. Four technicians were sitting around in the front. Ten minutes of icy stares later, I left without even being acknowledged.

I love to buy locally when I can. I asked the owner of True Brew where they get their beans and lo! I was directed to Passport Coffee & Tea. Passport has finally given me a place to snag espresso beans without ordering them from my old haunt in Santa Clara.   Passport Coffee and Tea is a tiny, unassuming space tucked in the Scottsdale Airpark neighborhood. This family-owned shop is mostly devoted to retail goods, but the woman working when we stopped in offered us each a glass of one of their iced tea blends. It was pretty tasty too!  They have separate menus for coffee and tea. Not everything is out on the floor, so be certain you take a peek at these as you might miss something good! In addition to their own coffee and tea blends, they carry a few large brands (like Numi) as well as accessories (thermometers, double walled glasses, timers, et cetera). Passport is a little one stop shop of caffeinated delight.   My only gripe is the hours. They are only open during business hours during the week. However, you can order from them online as well, or bribe a friend to pick up your beans if you can't play hooky to get your fix.

I visit this post office branch on a regular basis. The staff is incredibly friendly and knowledgeable, and far easier to deal with than many other branches in the city. This location is just south of Loop 101, off of 59th Avenue. There are two Automated Postage Centers (APCs) - one inside the main service area and one outside in the lobby - which makes service here fast as many people opt to use these instead. Even when there is a line, they burn through it efficiently. This is also one of the branches that takes passport applications, though you must make an appointment first.

OH EM GEE. Fuego, I love everything you do.  My journey with Fuego began at last year's taco festival in October. Their offerings were so moist and juicy that I knew I was going to be a repeat customer. Then, much to my dismay. Fuego Tacos did not open until January 2011. I had to content myself with its delicious but pricer older sister, Fuego Bistro (where I would dine every day if I could afford it).  Finally, fast forward a few more months and I got to try the amazingness that is Fuego Tacos again and my palate sang with delight.  So, enough with story time. Let's move on to the review.  The menu is fairly simple. It's mostly taco plates or à la carte tacos, with a few side items. They also have the same legendary mojitos as Fuego Bistro in about a billionty tongue-pleasing flavors. Alright, it's more like thirty, but it is still a lot.  The server will bring complimentary homemade chips and salsa to your table. The taco plates come with two tacos, rice, and beans with a price tag ranging from $9 to $12. But, on Mondays and Tuesdays, taco plates are half off if you buy a drink so have a mojito too. If you go during happy hour (3-7pm), drink prices are $3-$4. So, you can score both for less than the price of a normal taco plate. Win-Win.   The spicy margarita made with jalapeño-infused tequila that is made of the devil's spittle, I assure you. It is rimmed with crack-tastic cumin salt. However, it is not a drink for the timid as a few sips from my date's drink and I felt like I gained a half dozen ulcers. I love spicy, so this is a dangerous combination. Stomach lining won over palate in this case.  In my experience, service at Fuego restaurants is always friendly and attentive without smothering you. I found this to be the case at Fuego Tacos as well. We received attention from both our server and the bartender. They wanted to make sure that we were taken care of and that we were happy with our selections. Spoiler alert: We were.  Pros: - Delicious - Good value for the money - Friendly, attentive service  Cons: - Parking (Your best bet is  to leave your car across the street at the Biltmore Fashion Park and walk through the tunnel underneath Camelback.) - Closed Sundays

Jamburritos is like an ice cream truck for adults. I was fortunate enough to encounter my newest addiction at the Phoenix Food Truck Festival.  The Jambalaya burrito had the perfect blend of heat and spices. The catfish is expertly breaded and fried. The hushpuppies were delightfully fluffy, moist balls of crackalicious magic. I honestly had not considered the potential of Creolexian until now. I'm fairly convinced Jamburrito can do no wrong.  I wish these guys lived in my neighborhood so that I could conveniently drop by for dinner. Phoenix needs a fleet of these trucks so that I can happily grow fat.

The portions are the epitome of American excess. However, if you want a pound of flavorless slop in a styrofoam container, be my guest.  We ordered two Trident plates, which come with two predesignated sides. I chose the Reuben, which came with their macaroni salad (noodles + mayonnaise) and home fries. The Reuben honestly tasted like spam. Even the spicy meat sauce did not have a characteristic flavor. It was just wet meaty stuff. Overall, the food was greasy and fairly tasteless. I choked my meal down in the hope that it would fill the void left by my disappointment. Sadly, it did not.   We came in on a Groupon, so thankfully we did not pay full price. There was a lot of food, but I've honestly eaten better in truckstops than on this culinary misadventure.  Pros: - Friendly staff - Inexpensive - Monstrous proportions  Cons: - Bland - Greasy

I adopted one of my two cats from HALO Animal Rescue. He came microchipped, vaccinated and neutered. Granted, I did pay a little more than I would have from the Humane Society, but HALO is a no-kill shelter and they help quite a few troubled animals in our area. Their website is easy to navigate and peppered with adorable animal pictures. I'm definitely in danger of becoming a crazy cat lady as long as HALO is around.
