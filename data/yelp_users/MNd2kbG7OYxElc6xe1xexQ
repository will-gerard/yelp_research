The DBG is a very well run establishment. The garden staff is knowledgable and courteous and the setting is really spectacular. It's a wonderful place to get away alone and they also have a robust schedule of interesting events and music. It's a treasure.

I hadn't been to the D&D for a few years and then, yesterday, friends suggested it as a meeting spot. I had forgotten about their lovely tucked away setting, the ability to order a sandwich EXACTLY like I want it and that they have both wine and live music. Upstairs is a nice variety of seating where it is quiet enough to hold a small meeting or read or just enjoy conversation with a friend. The large windows let in plenty of day light and the nature photos on the walls are just spectacular. If you have a need for a kitchen gadget or a small gift, it's also worth perusing their market. Yesterday a local musician performed while a number of people sat outside with their lunch or wine glass. If you've ever heard of biophilic design, this place has it and I believe it is why people feel so comfortable here. By the way, their soups, sandwiches and salads are very good. The counter help is friendly and if you're in the area, it should be your go to sandwich spot.

Phoenix is one of only 6 cities to get a center like this. They've taken a derelict parcel of ground and converted it into something beautiful and sustainable. Every time I go I see some special bird or bug that I haven't seen before. The River Pathways program is amazing and available to kids who might otherwise not get an experience like this.

I know the rating is low and part of it is undeserved. The people at Salon Sandoval are warm and welcoming and I have been happy with their services. They are an Aveda salon which is how I got their name. My stylist, Ruby, left there and then there seemed to be a ton of turnover. So, the reason for the rating? It's filthy. They honestly need to close for a week and have a deep cleaning, scrubbing, work it over. They also did a good job with my kids.

eeew. It started with a cranky waiter who told me that if I wanted to know the specials, then I should have read them on the board. The food was downhill from there. The entire place smelled like fried onions.

Outstanding sandwiches!  The Capistrami and Slaw-B-Joe's ROCK!  Moreover, nobody can come close to the bread that they use.  Capriotti's would deliver sandwiches to our Little League snack stand, and they were always snapped up within minutes.

The proprietor is so friendly. They have a terrific selection of smoothies and juices and there is no problem finding out what the ingredients are! Prices are very reasonable for fresh juice.

This place is not far from our home yet we had never been. We were hungry for Mexican food and the yelp reviews weren't bad so we gave it a try.  They were busy on Friday night but we were seated quickly. Our server (failed to get her name) was terrific. She helped us navigate the menu in terms of what were big sellers and her personal favorites. She put warm chips and fresh salsa on the table. The salsas were fresh and good.  Portions were large and they were very accommodating for a special order from my son (hold the tomatoes, hold the onions). I ordered a guacamole tostada and a bean burrito served enchilada style. It was way too much food. Apparently they have a buffet at lunch time and I'd like to try it as I have three sons who scarf most meals these days.  We'll go back - sorry I hadn't tried it earlier.

The Phoenix Art Museum (PAM) is such a gem and the exhibits are getting better and better. Under the leadership of Amada Cruz, the museum is taking some risks and I trust that museum visitors are rewarding them for doing so. It is a terrific atmosphere just to unwind and enjoy. At the moment, there is both the White Shirt exhibit - who knew that white shirts could be displayed as architecture that is truly stunning. Michaelangelo is also there - a very first in AZ!! The drawings are centuries old and packed with detail.  Palette, the PAM cafe, also does a terrific lunch. Their menu is somewhat seasonal but also attempts to reflect the current exhibits in some way. The museum shop is also a terrific place to get a unique gift.  Check out their website for exhibits, special shows, discussions and free days. They do a great job. The staff is friendly.  One criticism? That Phoenix area residents need to provide more support to PAM. It's a jewel in our midst.

I followed a stylist to Salon Tru a couple of years ago. It's clean and easy to park and they remind me with a follow up phone call. The salon is fine but Colleen, the stylist is amazing. Not only does she truly listen and work with me to achieve the outcomes that I want but she's bent over backwards to accommodate my wacky schedule. Love it.

Best outdoor patio in the springtime. It is oh so enjoyable to sit outside and have a drink and their daily appetizer. Gorgeous flowers, music, ambiance - they've got it down. Lon's is also terrific indoors. The southwest decor and comfy homestead feel really put you at ease.  Valet parking is free. There are terrific private room options for special occasions. I've had many of the appetizer options but also some wonderful lunches and dinners. Service is exceptional. This is a perfect spot for happy hour or a special meal.

Awesome programming for children's theater! They also run acting classes for children on weekends and during summer camps. My child has participated numerous times and we've seen incredible progress in his talent and skills.

There is nothing like cheering for the home team and the Arizona Diamondbacks have a home here at Chase field. The re-tractable roof is amazing. They're able to cool it and make it extremely comfortable even on a very hot day. There are some local food options inside the park as well. I think the Diamondbacks do about the best in the MLB of fan appreciation.

There is little that I don't love about this place. They have an amazing outdoor market on Wednesday and Saturdays. The ingredient for lunches, coffee, wine, etc.. are locally sourced and fresh. The entire place is run as a not-for-profit to bring wholesome food to people who might not otherwise have access. Do go visit. It's good and it's good for the community.

This is fast becoming my go-to lunch spot. Helpful staff, forbidden rice bowl, salmon super foods. I brought a team here for a celebration and it worked great; everyone raved about the green chile and the meat balls. Stopped in on a sunday and they had live music. A Great experience.

This restaurant is within walking distance of my office and could easily be my "go to" place for lunch. The menu has a good variety and they serve quickly. It's a bit noisy outdoors so I opt for an indoor table where I can have a conversation with my lunch partners.  Yesterday I ordered a shrimp-salmon salad with dressing on the side and no red onions. The server was friendly and completed my order exactly the way I asked for it. My first bite of salad was GAK. I then proceeded to dissect the dish and found that in the lettuce mix they were using for the salad, one variety had spoiled. We're not talking wilted lettuce. I'm talking about slimy black leaves throughout the dish. I picked it apart so that I could show someone.  Unfortunately, the server didn't return. Later (40 minutes), the busboy came to take my dish and I said that I wanted to keep it to show it to someone. Then the manager came over and I explained that the lettuce appeared to have gone bad. He gave a nice apology but didn't offer to bring me a different dish. The bill arrived in the next few moments and had a $4 deduction.   While I appreciate the effort, by bringing this to his attention, I no doubt allowed him to fix the problem for the remaining customers and probably saved him a few more $4 rebates. I think the place could be more generous with their service recovery.  They're off my list for a while.

Totally disappointed in the way this restaurant is going. The lettuce in my salad today was slimy and black and old. When I pointed it out to my server, his comment was "what would you like me to do? Can you eat around it? I can get you a free dessert."  This circumstance was not the first. Twice in the last couple of weeks they screwed up my order and when I pointed it out " I can get you a free dessert" I can only imagine why they want to go rid of their desserts. I'd much prefer a reduction on my bill for poor quality.  They are busy and service has slowed at lunch time. 11:30 is a very convenient spot for me but frankly, their lack of attention to customers is driving me away.

The cartel has become my go-to coffee stop on Saturdays. They care about their product - carefully brewing their coffees and teas to rode an to perfection. They are well kitted with outlets and wifi which makes it a good productive environment and not too noisy. Lots of room since their expansion. I'll keep coming back.

Eddie's House is a great local establishment. Eddie walks the floor to see if you're having a good experience and he has great specials nearly every evening. I love that I can order a half portion of most dinners but then did notice that my 8 year old's meal was as big as mine for half the price. We'll definitely go back often.

We've started making Eddie's House a regular friday routine. Tonight he had Lebanese specials made by his mama. The stuffed squash and green beans in tomato sauce were awesome. My kids swear by the mac and cheese and they love the spices on the flatbread.

We've been using the Desert Roots Farm CSA for over two years.  During that time, our delivery has always been here when promised. The weekly share is abundant and includes all fresh, locally grown produce.  In addition, it often includes something that I would not have purchased causing our family to expand its palatte. We love it!

Nothing over 9 at noon. This is my go-to lunch spot. I like the salmon a lot but I get it with a salad instead of risotto. The trio which changes daily is a great idea. It's a salad, soup and sandwich but in proportions that make it doable for lunch. The beet salad is fresh and local and the service is always really good. They call me by my name and that goes a long ways. There's a terrific private room if you reserve it and this place is never too noisy to carry on a conversation.

I called Scramble two days in advance because I was trying to put a group together for breakfast. The first time it rolled to a recording and I chose not to leave a message but the second time, I listened to their message more closely. It clearly states to leave a message and they will call you back.  I left a cheerful request to have a reservation for 5 on Saturday morning but also said that if, by chance, they do not take reservations, please call me back.  On Saturday morning, two members of my group became unavailable so I called Scramble to let them know that I was changing the reservation from 5 to 3. "We don't take reservations". Ugh.  I politely let them know that I'd left a message saying that if they didn't take reservations, please call. "We didn't get the message." Ugh  Once I did get there, the line moved swiftly and my order was delivered as anticipated. It's a bit difficult there to meet friends because if you are not there at the same time, then you either wait to get in line or receive your food at different times.   The food and the service were both good. Servers were friendly and helpful. I would go back but they need to fix their telephone communications in order to get a better rating from me.

Ok, this was just a quick stop but the person behind the counter literally stopped in the middle of taking my order and walked over to wipe some counters and then came back and said, "whose order was this?" She was exasperated and trying to get sympathy about how busy it was - it wasn't. Not very friendly service which is really all that differentiates them. I don't go to Starbucks often because I prefer independent coffee shops but I will try to not go to this one in the future.

Gallo Blanco has a wonderful menu and even my kids enjoy it. There's heavy steak and eggs for the guys in my family, tacos and wonder huevos dishes on the lighter side. Their drinks are really delicious also. I like the ambience and put this restaurant on our top list.

Their service is not fast however, everything is done with craftsman like quality. There's a wide variety of breakfast treats from delicious quiches to homemade organic burritos. In the afternoon, they discount their baked goods in order to make room for the new ones. I love how they slide open the big front windows on a beautiful day and whether you're inside or outside you're enjoying it alfresco.  They have a terrific selection of coffees and loose leaf teas. In fact, their teeth this is one of my favorite options. Service is friendly but again, don't go if you're looking for a very fast visit.

Great cup in the early am. No short cuts. It's also easy to hear so a great spot for an early morning meeting. They have some type of partnership with Kaleidiscope so there are also great juices available and plenty of healthy food options. I've been a fan of the Tempe Cartel for a long time but this is a great downtown Phoenix location.

I have ordered lunch from here before but never even thought about having dinner at the Herb Box. Last night with #canalconvergence going on, we wandered through the public art and then looked for a place to eat. Everything was super busy but the Herb Box had an acceptable wait time and room at the bar. The drinks menu has a great variety. My husband ordered a super hoppy IPA while I indulged in their lemon basil martini. The pours were generous. After about 30 minutes we were seated at a great table where we could hear dinner conversation. The doors were open to the outdoors and it was a great setting. My husband was really happy with the Thai ribs. I ordered the Cauliflower steak. It is a gorgeous dish. In fact, I should have posted a photo except that I am tired of people taking pictures of their food in restaurants. Trust me, it looks and tastes amazing. Roasted cauliflower on a bed of black lentils garnished with roast brussel leaves and some type of savory mustard sauce. Oh, and pickled grapes! A surprisingly wonderful addition.   We got a couple of sides - everything was very good. The last elusive star is retained because I felt like we could have been seated a lot faster. Table service was very good. We'll go back.

I've given this place two tries within a week. The service is very good and I have no problem getting a table as it's dead. That makes it a quiet environment where it's super easy to have a conversation.  I stick to the soup and salad duo at lunch which may be part of the problem. The soup is good but the soup of the day has been the same for two days this week leading me to believe that it's freshness is in question. The salad I tried both times is the beet salad. It's also good but the portion is really small and underwhelming. I left hungry on both occasions.  It is super easy to drive up and valet off central which makes it attractive for a downtown spot but since I'm walking from my office, that's not a consideration.  I'm afraid that I'm taking this one off my lunchtime list.

First time to Il Bosco and I was not disappointed. We shared a Calabrese salad and the pizza special. It was a perfect amount of food for two and delicious. The timing of delivering the pizza to our table was great as was the consistency - no soggy middle like you get other places. The proprietor was friendly and helped us make good choices. The spot is cozy and their brick oven catering looks phenomenal.

I was in an area of town that I don't know well so, of course, I used Yelp to assist me with lunch plans. First, Pita Kitchen is super convenient - right off I-10 and 99th Avenue. When I walked in, the place was buzzing. In fact, every table was filled but fortunately, one group was waiting for a to-go order so my colleague grabbed their table.  It's a walk-up order situation. A super friendly smiling woman helped advise our order. She was hyper knowledgeable about the menu. My colleague ordered a Gyro with hummus and I got the mediterranean salad with chicken. We also got a side of jalapeño cilantro hummus. Wow! This hummus is flat out delicious and all servings were generous. We were served in a very timely manner, loved the food and will definitely go back when in the area.

I've been eagerly awaiting the opening of Gertrude's. Tonight, I was able to stop in for after-work wine and apps and I was not disappointed. The place is lovely - nice outdoor patio and great art on the walls. We ordered three appetizers; carpacio, stuffed dates and brussel sprouts.   While clearly not a full meal, this was a great way to try out the restaurant. The dates were AMAZING. The setting is superb. I'm going back on the weekend for breakfast.

Ok, I have to admit that I was skeptical. My 12 yo told me that he'd been to this place with his dad and that he liked the barbecue. Not being a huge barbecue eater, I hesitated but gave in as it was on our way home. It's in a strip mall with not much else going on. But, walking in, I was surprised. It's small but with nice ambience. Lights, candles, and friendly staff greeted us. We were asked about our preference in seating and service was immediate.  Our waiter recommended a $24 bacon platter. Are you kidding me? But again, I caved and the platter on a wooden chopping block was served. It was absolutely beautiful. 5 different varieties of bacon, cornichon, mustard, grilled bread, onion and pepper jam. My kid was in heaven and pounded 80% of it. I had a taste of 4 of the varieties - smoked in house. The jalapeño bacon was my favorite with real kick. After two slices of bacon, I trimmed my order back to a kale salad. It is interesting with a lot of different texture and flavor. My son had a burger and half of it landed in a to-go box.   Throughout our evening our service was spectacular. The waiters were attentive, answered questions, made recommendations and validated us as customers. If I were a big meat eater, no doubt I'd give this place five stars. The dinner for the two of us was also over $50 with no drinks so difficult on a budget.

This is a tough location for many. It's hard to park - I would recommend using the parking deck for the Science Center. It's also a little hard to find but when you do, it's a charming little set up. It's tiny and so there isn't a great deal of foot traffic but it's a great brew. There are no short cuts with the coffee. They take their time so you can't be in a hurry. Frankly, their location is a great excuse for me to get up from my desk and take a walk. They roast their beans in house in a massive contraption. On a hot day, I like to have one of their cold brews.

MOD is a very cool, hip space. By day, it is a meeting room, co-working opportunity. I believe you can pay by the hour or get monthly memberships. In the evening, it's open to the public and they have a full bar and food. There is plenty of seating in different configurations depending on what you require so it's a perfect late meeting spot or just a great space to stop in for a glass of wine. I hosted an event in the space for about 50 people. There was ample room for networking and there's also a patio if the weather is good. Their sound system could use an overhaul but it wasn't terrible. We ordered finger sandwiches and mozzarella tomato appetizers.  These were fantastic.  I'd definitely recommend this mid-town spot for your event needs and I will be back.

This set up is terrific. Korean Fried Chicken in an old KFC space. It's quick. It's clean and yes, it is popular.  When you walk in you are treated with a menu that is list an instruction manual - LOVE this.  Pick your chicken. Pick your sauce. Pick your side and take a doughnut. Of course, my son never made it that far as he salivated over the wide variety of interesting doughnuts in the case.  Get there early because when I went back later in the day, they were nearly cleaned out.  I got a chicken great with Korean chili sauce, a peanut slaw type of side and a cake doughnut. Wish the chicken was slightly more spicy but I can fix that. It was fresh and crispy and they're doing it all farm to table which I really appreciate.  I also read that they do an amazing noodle day on fridays and I will check it out.   The reason for 4 stars is their hours.  This is really far from my home and so I am limited to visiting on the weekends.   Great stop though!

Well, I was surprised that our after-game local had disappeared but am not sad since Alma wxsw has popped up in its place. Yesterday morning we had breakfast on their dog friendly outdoor patio and we were not disappointed. Valerie, our server, was friendly, knowledgable about the menu and on her game. Justin, another helper, served us with a friendly smile and conversation. They were both intent on making sure our needs were met.   My husband had been here a few days ago and raved about the green chile. We had a vegan friend with us and his needs were met! Given that it was the weekend, I started with a Hangover Helper. This is Alma's version of a bloody mary and I love the spiced rim. It was a great drink. My husband stuck with the Fresh Squeezed IPA - he's an IPA loyalist.  I can't remember the name of my breakfast dish but I went for the Southwest side of the menu. My plate had three corn tortilla cups filled with scrambled eggs and each one topped with something different; red chile, green chile, and spicy ranch beans. I honestly did not need to eat again for the entire day. DH got the tamale plate and raved about it.   Next time I will walk since I'll need to burn it off but I will go back - soon.
