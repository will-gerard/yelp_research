This shop is awesome.  They are right down the street from my house.  I used to take my car to the dealership for the regular oil change and whatnot,  but then I wised up.  The guys here are so nice. They don't try to up sell you or rope you into getting unnecessary repairs.   They made some suggestions as to what might need to be fixed and by when.  I asked them about an issue with my steering wheel and the cost to repair it.  The man that helped me told me that the  part that needed to be fixed had a recall on it,  but that my car wasn't included in the recall.   He suggested I contact Toyota Motor Co anyway and see if I could get it repaired for free or at a discount.  His advice saved me $600 as Toyota repaired it for free. That's some amazing customer service!  I'll be coming here regularly to service my car.

This review is long overdue.  I was in a hit and run a few months back. Unfortunately, I had to go through my insurance and pay a $500 deductible to get my car fixed.  I found these guys on Yelp and they more than lived up to their rating. Obviously being in a car accident is stressful, but they managed to make things go as smoothly as possible.  I told them that I didn't have rental car coverage on my insurance and that I would be paying out of pocket for that.  They said they would do what they could to get it done as  quickly as possible.  I dropped my car off on a Monday morning.  It was done Tuesday evening.  How awesome is that?! These guys are great.  I hope I'm never in this situation again,  but if I am,  I wouldn't hesitate to bring my car back here.

This company restored my faith in movers. I didn't have a ton of things to move,  but still needed help especially wIth the heavy items.   The guys showed up on time and worked quickly.  They were very friendly and thorough in their work.  The price was exactly what was agreed upon.  I hate moving,  but they made it painless. I wouldn't hesitate to use them again!

One of my favorite italian restaurants.  I'm convinced I can survive on their antipasto salad and cibata alone.  I always switch back and forth between two favorites: spaghetti and meatballs or the baked rigatoni. I also really like the chicken marsala.  And if you ever have room, do yourself a favor and order the cappuccino pie. So delicious!

I was warned not to try these donuts due to their addictive properties.  I should have heeded that warning.  Now I get wild cravings for their moist apple fritters and boston cream donuts.  And not only do they have a drive thru, but they are also open 24/7! My mouth is watering just typing this review.  So do yourself a favor, don't even get started on Bosa. You'll never be able to quit.

So I will just start off by saying that their customer service was great.  Aside from the fact that they try and up-sell you on everything, the front staff was nice and the girl that did my wax was very nice and very professional. Now I'll get to the actual waxing; the good part was that it hurt a bit less than the other brazillian waxes I've gotten.  I think they attribute that to the %100 beeswax that is used.  However, this wax did not last nearly as long as the other waxes I've received.  I normally go to Rio and they do a great job.  Their wax will keep me smooth for at least four weeks.  The wax I received at European Wax was cheaper, but only lasted about 2 weeks.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I don't think their wax pulls the hair out at the root.  I won't be going back.  It's worth a little extra money and pain to get the job done right.

I purchased a Groupon for this place and was excited to try it based on the good reviews.  When I got there everyone was welcoming and friendly.  I assumed based off of reading the website,  that this place was good for all types of people. Their site said the first session would be mainly working on proper form. Perfect!  So when I get there,  the instructor runs through about seven different circuits.  I was the newbie in the class and it was a little overwhelming for me.  She saw that I was having issues with the first circuit (burpees) so she moved me to the next. My form wasn't right on that one either.  She ended up pulling me out of the circuit all together and had me doing my own exercises separate from the group.  It was a little humiliating. To top it off she says I'm getting personal training for a groupon price. She said we could see how the week goes,  but if I don't improve,  this may not be the place for me.  Mind you,  I've never done a boot camp,  but I'm not a fitness novice either.  I ended up not going back just because the whole situation made me feel so embarrassed.  And that's not how I want to feel after a workout.  Money wasted.

I just have to say what an amazing job Katy did on my hair.  I had a horrible experience with extensions previously.  The stylist that did them permanently damaged my hair.  So I was extremely leary about having them done again.  Katy answered all my questions and was very knowledgeable. She knows her stuff!  The end product was long beautiful hair that blends into mine perfectly.  I would not hesitate to recommend her.  She's awesome.

Just had lunch at this place. The service was fast and friendly.  We got 2 rolls on their lunch special, one specialty roll, and an order of the yellowtail sashimi.  The girl brought out fresh wasabi on the house to try with the sashimi and it was delicious. The other rolls were equally good.  Our tab for everything came out to less than $30. Great deal for the quality.  Will definitely go back.
