I am redecorating my front lobby of my business; Essence of Harmony Sacred Massage.  After my artist / client Lucretia Torva stained the concrete slab of the floor, we needed a few NEW things to take my clients experience all the way to Morocco.    At Pier 1, I was greeted by a lovely gal, very friendly, who had a thick German accent and couldn't understand English that well.  She did the best she could by showing me around to the tables, vases, etc... but she couldn't 'get me', so I suggested I just look around.  Next, I bumped into a fella wearing the apron who acted too busy to help me, but did anyway because it was so slow that night.  I was a wee bit nervous picking out new things and it was clear that he tolerated me.    Finally, at the check out, I asked if there were any coupons I could use because I left my booklet at home.  He said NO, but gave me a small booklet in my bag.  After getting home I realize it is the same booklet I had forgotten with a 20% off coupon involved with it.  This could have saved me $30 which I would have appreciated grately.    Pier 1 clearly did not have my best interest at heart.  While the atmosphere in that place is like a child in The Chocolate Factory with Willy Wonka, I don't know how soon I will be going back.  ~ Luana Joya Lucia, International Massage Practitioner

I have been a patron of this local,  fairly traditional spot for nearly 40 years!  I actually once worked at the one on 32nd Street and Indian School for a week.  The salsa I can eat as a soup.  Nice and chunky, fresh, all around yummy.  The spicier salsa can be slightly dipped in periodically as necessary for an added hotttttness.    The menu hasn't changed much over the years.  The food is fresh and if not too careful could border non-authentic.  Overall, this is a great place you can count on for a sweet Mexican food experience.  My granddaughter and I are now the matriarch's in the family to continue the tradition of being loyal to this landmark!

Having dined here for nearly 6 years ....  Raising my children here every now and again we would feel like regulars.  All excited to say what we wanted, down to how many pieces of rice and beans with half and half chicken/steak on our burrito bowl to share.    Today I went in alone because my children are grown.  It had been at least a year since I was there with my boys and the manager asked how they were doing.  She recognized me!  All those people she sees everyday, and she remembers me and my boys!  That says a bunch about her relationship skills.    My middle son, Justin T. Webb, had passed away when a wreckless driver failed to yield before turning left and I shared that with her after she had asked about them.  She was touched and insisted on buying me my lunch.    As usual, the food is fresh, the chips laced with sea salt and lime, and the interpersonal relationship skills of the female manager here was a "10"!    Thank you for remembering us!

After over 12 years of being loyal to Dr. Serbin and his staff I experienced good service and not so good service.  Because I was loyal,  I stayed.  I experienced being offered services that were led to be believed included in our visit,  only to find out they weren't by the tally of the bill.  I fully understand we are all very human and that is why I kept quiet and just rolled along.  Well, my last visit I took a 3 week old kitten in who had been played with too hard by a neighbor dog.  The kitten was weak and in poor condition.  The front staff were teeter tottering on whether or not to charge me for an emergency visit or a regular visit due to my same day appointment.  I was desperate for the life of this kitten so I didn't complain.  We had to be seen.  I had good faith in this company and trusted them.  The Dr. was lovely, compassionate, educating and helpful.  The testing was going through the roof and kept getting higher and higher.  At the $350 mark, it was highly suggested we euthanize the sweet little dumpling.  There were 3 other kittens in this litter at home that I had planned to bring in to get spayed and neutered and the expense was starting to make me nervous of all this testing they were doing when it was clear the kitten was 'going quickly.'  Because I am a regular, having numerous pets who see Ingleside Animal Hospital on a regular basis, I wasn't shy in asking for a small discount knowing I was going to be spending hundreds for the spay and neutering within a few months.  The Dr. asked the office manager and the office manager agreed to 10% off the bill.  When the bill came, before we euthanized "Beloved", only $3 had been removed from $350.00.  I had asked to speak to the office manager and she came in ranting that I was only concerned about the money.  She was over the top rude and seemingly snapped.  This is odd as I was holding my sweet little kitten, visibly upset and crying, while she went on saying I was 'greedy' and all I cared about was my kitten.  The office manager, whom I had never met in the 12 years I had been a loyal customer, was more than rude, insensitive and clearly not someone who I would have deal with parents of pets who are on the brink of transitioning to the 'Rainbow Bridge'.  I told her I did not agree with her and that is when she said if I didn't pay what she said, regardless of her offering a 10% reduced fee of my bill, she would report me to the Maricopa County Care and Animal Control.  This sent me standing up, placing my limp kitten in my little basket and letting her know I was leaving and I would contact the owner when things calmed down to pay my bill.    I left with my brain damaged beautiful kitten and immediately went to the Arizona Spay and Neuter Clinic up the street on Thomas to have them safely, with love, euthanize the sweet little kitten I named "Beloved".  A few weeks later, I phoned Dr. Serbin and he notified me of his quick and lacksidaisy investigation on this subject.  My intention was to pay my bill and to share with him the uncomfortable and discord I experienced with his office manager.  He shared with me that he was very busy, his office manager had been with him since 'the beginning', and he would fax the records of all 13 of my pets to another Veterinarian of my choice.    So, I value his boundaries, disagree with his decision, and am fully surprised that he did not acknowledge or even believe his office manager would treat a customer like I was treated.  So interesting.  I am now going to Blue Cross Veterinarian Clinic.  Thank you Dr. Serbin for the 12 years of you serving my beloved pets and I am grateful you and your staff had the opportunity to do so.  I am very sorry that you could not even give an "I'm sorry" for the inappropriate and lack of professionalism and compassion your office manager served me on September 9, 2015.  I do hope that this individual NEVER treats another client like I was treated and that Dr. Serbin considers the experiences of his clients while investigating and taking into account the behaviour of  his personnel.

I have been to the Vision Quest Metaphysical Bookstore dozens of times this past year alone.  I go to just 'be', look at the books, the pretty trinkets, and to the workshops that are being held there on a nightly calendar.    The people are friendly to me, the place is clean and comforting.  The people that it attracts are interesting, like you and I.  I have plans to continue going back again and again ~

Cibo!   Eating outside is a major part of the experience even on a hot summer night in Phoenix!  Worth the dampness from head to toe.  The BONUS is sitting under the African tree with the lights and grapes with the FULL moon shining on us  ~  Our red haired waiter sporting 1950's style glasses was fun, fun, fun and pleasingly attentive.   We had white wine;  superb choice thanks to the 4 different wine tastes I received while choosing it.    The strawberry/walnut salad was a bit dry, yet the feta was marvelous!  Great soft texture to melt in your mouth.    The pizza was the sausage and it was wood fired, nice and perfect.  Just enough food for the 3 of us ~  So much food, just the right amount for our bellies.  For the 3 of us, the bill was only $43.00.  Not too bad on a Saturday night to go in 1/3's.  ~ Luana Joya Lucia

NOT Happy!  I have been here on dates maybe a dozen times since it opened a few years ago.  This time I went with my friend.  The server looked at me like she was pissed at something I did years ago and she never forgave me.  She kept walking passed us without taking our drink order.  I ordered wine which took 10 minutes to get to our table only to have a small fly like insect in it attempting to do the back stroke  and getting her to take it back was like pulling teeth.  Our meal was 45 MINUTES late and there were only about 5 other couples in there after the lunch rush.  The meal was awful, the hamburger was still bleeding and we had to ask to take it back to re-cook it.  Needless to say, this wasn't my day or the servers day.  I had to hunt her down to get our check getting the manager to find her.  I shared this info with one of my regular massage clients and he shared with me a similar instance happened to him at Chelsea's Kitchen and they got a $200 gift certificate because they came in with 2 other couples.  Honestly, I don't feel I will be back.    Farewell Chelsea ~

Allison is a 'radar detector' and liason for Chelsea's Kitchen and saw my less than unhappy 'yelp' about Chelsea's the day I wrote it.  She immediately connected with me wanting to redeem this landmark on 40th Street just a tad North on Camelback.  This is rare, so my interest was piqued!  My friend Linda and I were going to eat somewhere that day and thought I would give Allison a ring.  She immediately asked if I wanted to have lunch that day (She must have heard my hunger pains!) and let me know the General Manager would be awaiting my arrival.  Linda and I entered Chelsea's and I had a new awakening, like it was a total new experience.  I desired to give them an opportunity so my slate and plate were clean!  FIRST, everyone there was the epitome of 'the Dove girl', which is refreshing!  Perfect posture, not a hair out of place, loving, caring, lovely posture, and more than hospitable.  We were greeted by the hostess who let us pick the seating for our next 2.5 hours of delight, then our 'water girl' named Susanne who was joyfully friendly and chatted with us some about more than water and lemons.  Then we were greeted by Erica, our server, letting me know the menu was open to whatever we desired for lunch due to my last experience there at Chelsea's.  I FELT SO LOVED!  My son had passed away a year ago this week, and I so desired this energy of being taken care of by these lovely women who could have been my daughters.  Linda and I ordered the wine from Santa Barbara, (very near and dear to me as I raised my boys up and down the California coast) and we actually had the carafe, 1 each :-) !  We then enjoyed the deviled eggs with bacon which melted in our mouths, then the 'salad' which I added a touch more salt and then the main event:  The Chelsea Cheeseburger!  OH, how i hungered for a lovely burger, once in a while is a requirement for me!  Well done, ordered to perfection, crisp onions, juicy pickles, yummy Wisconsin cheese, tender bun, mayo, mustard, and ketchup.  They could hear my loving moans from the kitchen!  BECAUSE .....  After our main entre', the Executive Chef, Jorge Gomez, walked out smiling with a special desert and coffee (HOW DID THEY KNOW!!!).  He was a lovely guy, knowledgeable, precise, and in love with the love of good eats, both devouring and creating!    During our meal, the General Manager gazed over to make sure we were smiling, laughing and most of all, relishing in our lunch extravaganza; Chelsea style.  I NOW give Chelsea's Kitchen 5 STARS, and as a bonus 5 EXTRA GOLD STARS for directing me back, inviting me to partake in a quality long-lasting relationship with them after they showed me just what they are made of!  Dinner is right around the corner!  Maybe Chelsea's tonight!  Luana Joya Lucia

They love us there!  I go with my son Justin's cute girlfriend and I could very well pass for her older sister ~ Needless to say, we get a bunch of attention from these already attentive waiters, busmen, and hosts.    The egg rolls are scrumptious; well done on the outside and soft and fresh on the inside with orange sauce.  The Dan Dan Noodles were yummy with minced chicken and a nice texture.  The lemon chicken was an 8, thick sauce and fried nice.    The Cupcake Chardonnay was yummy; sipable, not chugable.  They actually had a great band there, every Saturday night!  The music had me dancing in my seat.  Songs like "Summertime", "The Girl From Nepamima" ( what is the correct spelling please!), etc ....  They aim to please and for a neighborhood restaurant, they get an 8!

They take care of me at The Vig.  My local hot spot where I take my clients sometimes after their massage with me.  The food is always fresh, the servers are continually delightful and my clients leave with a full belly and happy.  Happy Hour is grand!  From 3 to 6 pm you can get 12 plump, juicy chicken wings with blue cheese and celery sticks for only $4.50.  I adore the wines, and they are only $6.    The Vig Azz burger is yummy.  YES, I like meat :-)  Veggies too, yet, the burger is cooked to order, fresh condiments, huge onion rings and the buns are soft ~  I am hungry for it right now ~

Out on a date and he says "Pita Jungle" after the show.  I say OK!  I am in love with the red bell pepper hummus and rice pudding ~  We get there around 12:30 pm on a Sunday (today) afternoon.  Not a wait (great!) we sit by the wall so we can hear each other!  The place is always noisy as it is a cafeteria type setup.  Our waitress was on top of things, wine, ordering, etc.    He orders the Faluja somethings which are like vegan meatballs in a salad.  We share the Moroccan Gazpacho Soup (YUM YUM YUM) and I lay into the hummus.    Needless to say with all that food we were stuffed!  With 2 glasses of wine I was ready to take a walk (in Phoenix I think it was like 120,000 degrees outside) so we walked around the misters ~   Clean place, staff ready to serve, food a plenty, and he treated :-)  The bill was only $39.00 with all that scrumptious food!  ~ Luana Joya Lucia

I first learned of this 'hole in the wall' fabulous gem when I was taken by the hand there by a former love last winter.  I hadn't been back until a few weeks ago and I am still in love with the YUMMY YUM YUM YUM food and smoothies they whip up.    While dining there they make me feel like a Goddess and will act as your 'date' if you go in solo or with another girlfriend.  It doesn't hurt to have amazing company and laughter while you dive into your California Club and inhale your Breakfast Buzz!  The oatmeal is something amazing and everything is simply tasty!  The price is nice and is someplace I would take the snobbiest "Scottsdalelight" for a pleasant surprise and an amazing meal.  The portions are sharable if you are watching your wallet or waistline!

It's that time again!  At least 3 times per year, once every 4 months I like to get Horizon out to my residence and business local where I reside pleasantly with 2 large dogs, and 6 felines, indoor/outdoor.  NEEDLESS to say, I clean every day!  I only trust Horizon because the owner is in on the action, makes sure that I am satisfied and he values his employees and customers.  I always have my grout/tile cleaned, my 5 pretty oriental rugs cleaned, and my pretty sofa cleaned when they come.  They are efficient, kind, caring, and sometimes they will even eat my chocolate chip cookies!  That alone is something to be recognized!  Thank you Horizon for taking care of me and making me feel like I matter!  Luana Joya Lucia

I have been seeing Joey, Scotty, Adele, Marie and now Christy for nearly 10 years!  They not only are amazing stylists, colorists, but also friends.  It is difficult not to want to invite them for dinner after your session with them.    They make me feel and look gorgeous.  They CARE and it shows.  It is an honor to call them my Beautification Team, and trust me when I do photo shoots, have special dates or just wanna look good for fun, they are the trusty professionals to book with.    I trust them with my hair, my products, my color and yes, Adele is the famous 'waxing my furry little face' gal.  When you set your appointment, tell em Luana Lucia sent you : -)  They will be thrilled ~ Luana Joya Lucia

I am attending the Laura Gisbourne Conference here this weekend.  Raining cats and dogs ( thank God, the desert needs the drink! ) and I pull up seeing a majestic overhang with a handsome young valet guy awaiting my arrival!  Courtesy valet and all!  I walk into the resort and it is very pretty.  Unique!  I love the ambience.  EVERYONE was sweet, the energy was amazing.  I was directed to the conference room and it was huge, well put together and everything fell into place.  The restrooms are sparkly clean and the outside quarters are plush.  I am looking forward to returning tomorrow and Sunday for the rest of this conference.  ~ Luana Joya Lucia

This morning, I was on a date with 'self'.  I was in between clients and had a good 2.5 hours to spare and I was starving after my 3 hour massage session.    The Ranch House Grille is a homey place and the waiters are very attentive even before you are seated!  This morning was no different.  The waiter was so friendly, I thought he was going to ask me out, which was not an issue.  Friendliness over moodiness any day!  I have been about a dozen or so times with my clients to this country bit of a cafe in the Arcadia/Biltmore area.  The eggs are always fresh yet the coffee isn't worth a bean ~ AND I LOVE COFFEE!  I adore steak and eggs and the steak is less than moovelous ; -(    SOOO, I'll try the pancakes next time.  I like to stay in my neighborhood when I go out to eat, it will be worth another shot!

THANK YOU!  For my paperback copy of Illusions by Richard Bach ~   My lovely client who generally always become friends, and I went to lunch and talked about books she loved.  After realizing I never read this small read, she insisted on hunting it down.  We checked 3 other bookstores in the Biltmore area and Bard's came through.  The book was only $3.50, great shape, and they were extra friendly!  Here's to a weekend reading thanks to Bards ~ Luana Joya Lucia

My boyfriend is a former NHL Hockey player from the late 70's, early 80's.  Needless to say, he 'needs' his hockey!  With pucks and sticks, he likes yummy wings, and the facaccia  ( yes, I know it is spelled wrong ) buffalo wrap with extra chicken for only $2 plus a side of wing sauce.  He loves the fries which always come HOT and OILY, and I love the salad with their yummy blue cheese dressing with extra chunks of cheese on top.  The service is good and they remember us there.  We like the ZIPPS in Tempe outside seating for a change of pace.    ENJOY !

I have been seeing Michelle for over 1 year to 'save face' sometimes once per week and other times once a month!  Her work is impeccable, as each time I leave her office, my face feels complete.  She is about 10 miles away from me, yet it is worth the drive!  Michelle is conscientious, knowledgeable, and loving.  She cares for me personally as a client and as a dear friend.  I would send any one of my clients to see her for any kind of aesthetic work they require!  I do hope she never moves out of the state, I just may have to follow!

I follow THEM!  Adele and Marie are simply my beauty consultants, hair dressers, color specialists, and fun girlfriends.    Adele is having her Grand Opening tonight for FRENCH METHOD SALON and I am tickled pink to be attending.    My hair is special to me and I wouldn't trust anyone other than Adele to cut, trim and style my locks.  I book her for special dates.  She always gives me a one of a kind hair style which I ALWAYS GET COMPLIMENTED ON.  ALWAYS at least once a week someone says how cute my style is.  Sophistication, elegance, playfulness and femininity bounce off of my style she creates personally on my head.  She is a fabulous waxer as well.  I never, ever walk out of there with less hair than I wanted to give up.    Marie is fabulous as well to style my hair when I had my last photo shoot.  I can depend on these gals to be there long term and in a pinch.    Pictures to follow!
