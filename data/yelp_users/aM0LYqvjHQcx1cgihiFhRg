My Wine Cellar is owned and staffed by knowledgeable, friendly, and genuine people. The food is great and pairs well with the extensive wine list. There is also a selection of craft beers on tap for the non-oneophilea of your group.  There is a wine club to join, wine classes to attend, and local artists on display.  This is a classy joint that is great for your happy hour with your colleagues, date with your lady, or just to catch up on SportsCenter on the tele with your lonesome.

Not good.  This place is not good.  I'll bet it used to be good, but now it is not good.    My girlfriend got the mole chicken enchiladas on the servers recommendation.  The dish was flavorless and the chicken was dry.  I got the Carne Asada tacos, and while edible, they were nothing special.  The artwork is fantastic and the server was accommodating (she removed the enchiladas from the tab and offered to get us something else).  However, I would recommend avoiding this place.

The service was slow, the server knew nothing of the wines on the menu and knew nothing of proper wine service.  Boo.

Two years ago, I walked into Studio Vino on a lark.  I sat down and was greeted immediately by the owner Kari and the barkeep Caylan.  I was made to feel welcome, and I had such an awesome time that I came back the next week.  That night, Kari served myself and the lovely lady sitting to my left some great wines at great prices.  We talked and laughed late into the night.  That lovely lady who was on my left was Tricia and she is now my girlfriend.  I love this place.

I wanted to replace my single pane, aluminum frame, original windows in my '80s build condo.  I searched Yelp and found Arizona's Best Windows and called for a quote.  Robert was thorough and detailed in is measurements and explanations of options.  He answered all my questions and gave me a very competitive quote.  I said go.  Robert did what he said would do, when he said he would do it, for how much he quoted.  I was so impressed, that on his way out I asked him for a quote to replace my exterior doors.   I had a fantastic experience with Arizona's Best Windows!

My girlfriend i love, love, love this place. Excellent food, beers, and wine to enjoy on premises.   Friendly, helpful, and funny staff.  A wonderful grocery to shop from, and an amazing selection of cheese and wine.  It's a total foodie destination.  This place is fantastic.  Ahwahtukee (and Phoenix in general) needs more quality driven, food and wine centric places like this.

Solid restaurant with excellent food.  However, we encountered an order snafu (wrong dishes served in two of the courses) and the brisket was sub-par (two diners at our table ordered it and agreed.)   The server did her best to make it right.    Enjoy a cocktail but stay away from the brisket.

I brought my new (to me) '07 Toyota 4Runner to Mike and Mark after it started shifting strangely.  Mike and Mark assuaged my fears of a completely blown transmission.  They also clarified some misunderstandings I had about my vehicle, as well as brought me into the garage to show me my car on the lift.  They showed me the cause of my problems and carefully explained the service that my vehicle did (and did not) need.    I was given a ride home, and was called in the afternoon (as promised) when my car was ready for pickup.  I am so glad to have found a local, trustworthy mechanic for my car.
