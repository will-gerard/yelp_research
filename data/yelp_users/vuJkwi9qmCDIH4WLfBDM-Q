Just because it's a "downtown staple" do not feel like you need to experience this eatery. Service was mediocre, food was not great. Asked if we were ready to order within 30 seconds of sitting down, then asked again 30 seconds later. Paid cash and change was not an option. Guess they take the tip that they want. Better places to visit downtown.

Friendly and courteous, always great service. Rather utilize John and Kathy's for postal needs, it is better than stepping over vagrants to get to the Central Ave post office! Thank you for being downtown!

Amazing food, excellent service and a beautiful atmosphere. After terrible dining on father's day weekend in Sedona, it was a great change of pace to go somewhere that actually had great food! I have to say that the gal that refills your water and clears your plate is by far the best employee! She even boxed up our leftovers! We will definitely return!!

If I could give no stars I would! RIP OFF artists! Told my brother he needed a crown and build up and that his tooth was "disintegrating" in his mouth. Tooth has never had so much as a filling and is in perfect health! HORRIBLE!!! STAY AWAY!

Let's say you go into the bank with a jar full of quarters that you have been saving for 2+ years. The bank has you put that money into a sack and they take that sack to count it in the back out of your view. Now you have counted these coins twice and you are 100% sure of the amount. The teller comes back and tells you the amount is $760 LESS then you have anticipated. What do you do? This happened today at this Bank of America to my husband and they said too bad, prove that amount to us. Cops say it's a civil matter. Won't return the coins either because they go to a magic vault to be counted and they can't get them back! Complaint filed with bank, so we shall see. This is why I left BofA years ago. SHADY and no customer service. CLOSE YOUR ACCOUNTS WITH THEM!

RUDE RUDE RUDE! Did I mention rude? First off we we not "allowed" to sit at the bar to wait for our table and were told 3 times very rudely that it would be just one second. Our waitress was nice and attentive, at first. We had a party of 8 and they will not split the check, that's OK. Well it took a minute to split the check correctly, and the waitress came over 3 different times to see if "we were done yet". Once we settled our $250+ bill we were in the midst of gathering our things to leave and the waitress came over again to tell us that we needed to leave because other people were waiting for the table. Will not be back even after they expand. Very pretentious, drinks were not very good, although sushi was good.

A+++ Customer service. I am always greeted with smiles, and on a hot day a bottle of water. Here this bank is going over the top with genuine friendly customer service, and other banks are now charging you to walk in the door to make transactions. I have a personal banker! Yeah, that is correct! I am not a millionaire by any means, but MidFirst Bank makes me feel like one. Heidi is a wonderful and friendly person. She came to my office to introduce herself and drop off some banking information. Do yourself a favor, and drop that BIG BANK! This is a big bank with hometown values and feel! LOVE LOVE LOVE!

Amazing friendly service! Sharon is super nice and very attentive. We had a fabulous dining experience, even with 2 small children in tow!  Highly reccomed the Sun Devil roll! If you like spicy rolls, you will thouroughly enjoy! Price was extremely reasonable.  They even have a food challenge! The Godzilla roll (which is delicious) challenge. If you can eat it in an hour it's free and you get a t-shirt! My dining partner has set this as his goal for his upcoming birthday!  We will be coming here for a long time!!

I always get top notch service at West of Soho. This family owned and operated business is very unique! They have the latest fashion at very reasonable prices. I shop here at least 3 times a month! They are always getting new shipments of clothing and accessories, so they have lots to offer! This is a can't miss shop at Cityscape!

This is a review for the ultimate driving experience. I bought this as a gift to my husband for Christmas. He absolutely loved it! He was able to drive all 4 cars and had the most amazing experience of his life! Charlie, who helped us out went above and beyond to make sure we had a fantastic experience! He definitely enjoys what he does. He loves making customers smile and is very friendly! I would recommend this experience to everyone! How often do you get to drive a Lamborghini or Ferrari in your lifetime? This is it!! Thank you Charlie and all the guys at global for making this experience absolutely amazing!!

Every time we go to this theater there is a technical issue. Today I took my kids to see Lego movie in 3D and there were about 2 speakers on in the whole theater! The surround sound in my living room is better! I wish AMC or Harkins would build a movie theater in Surprise already, this place is terrible. Oh, and don't waste $$ on popcorn it was stale and cold. Probably left over from last night. Next time I'll drive a bit further for a better experience.

Super friendly staff! Owner is amazing! Lacey took super excellent care of me and my hair! She's been my stylist forever! I live in surprise and I go all the way to Scottsdale to see her! She's the only one I trust my hair too! She is an artist! Very pleased with how my hair turned out! This location is super cute too! Very open and friendly!
