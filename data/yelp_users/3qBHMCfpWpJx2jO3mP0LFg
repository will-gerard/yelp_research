Our contractor recommended we come to AZ Tile to look at the countertops. Having done no research prior (I knew what my dream magazine kitchen looked like), we set off to look at our options. Lissa helped us and I'm so glad she did! This place was HUGE! My fianc√© and I had zero clue what we were getting ourselves into and she knew absolutely everything there is to know about granite, Quartz, marble, etc... She took what first seemed like a really overwhelming task and simplified it for us. After learning about each, we decided Quartz was our best option for getting the look we wanted while still being durable and functional for our home. After narrowing down our choices Lissa took us to this big TV and showed us this tool they have on their website where you can virtually choose a kitchen and the counter tops and cabinet colors and everything. It was so cool and totally needed to help narrow down our favorites. By the end of it, she didn't pressure us into buying. She gave us some samples to take home and gave us her card in case we had questions.   After driving all over town going to seriously every shop in town, we found that we still loved the Lyskamm Quartz sample we got from here. It wasn't our cheapest option of all the shops in town but it also wasn't the most expensive. And even better - it was truly our favorite! After some deliberation, we decided to purchase. Our contractor is installing it this week and we'll definitely be going back to see Lissa for our backsplash and flooring soon. To top off a great experience, we got a thank you card in the mail today. What great customer service! (We didn't get thank you cards from any other place we went to)   Overall I'd totally recommend that folks go here! In fact, you should start here and ask for Lissa and you'll get a wealth of knowledge to begin your journey and a nice thank you note. :)

Great ambiance - outdoor chairs for a chill night, great patio - that's where we sat. Outside bar then nice indoor dining and indoor bar. TVs are around if there's a game on. It's a big place, but cool vibe. Got the white sangria per our server's suggestion - very yummy and strong! I got the standard burger with the Caesar salad and the parmesan frittes. Got the garlic aioli and chipotle aioli on the side. Very good. The shoestring fries I could eat nonstop. Amazing!! Burger was good, nicely cooked. We also had soba beef noodles dish which was very good! We didn't get an appetizer but there were so many good ones to choose from. I loved our waiter, he was very knowledgable and professional and friendly. We will definitely be back! We want to try the brunch and I'll be coming here with my girlfriends on Thursday for ladies night. Fantastic deals!! Worth trying!

Great place for a date night or a girl's night out! They have one of those machines where you can try a bunch of different types of wines for a smaller taste, a mid pour or a full glass. It's pay as you go, which is nice (most I've been to, you have to prepay a certain amount). The food was incredible. We had the prosciutto melon dish with burrata then ordered four bruschetta: pancetta with dates, Brussels sprouts with goat cheese, salami pesto and the fruit mascarpone with honey. All were SO GOOD! Such great combinations and flavorful. I even liked it better than Postino's bruschetta options which is a BIG statement, I'm aware. Great ambiance, cute patio. A must try!

Caprese was very good but unusual from what you may be used to. Had pesto on it, which I personally love, but no balsamic. Wine was reasonably priced and yummy. Fire roasted Brussel sprouts fell flat. Egg was unnecessary and a little overcooked - it wasn't runny which is usually the point of adding the egg. I wanted to add salt for flavor. Margherita pizza with prosciutto was very good - slightly sweet sauce, pretty cheesy, phenomenal crust. Service was great. The ambiance was small and casual. They tried to make it low lighting for more intimacy, but there's not much money put into the ambiance. Waiter said new chef is straight from Sicily, and you could tell from the pizza but that's definitely their focus - brick oven pizza.

What a huge disappointment. I've eaten at Kneaders in other states and had a positive experience so I'm surprised I had such an awful experience top to bottom.  First off, we were the only people in there. Because of this, the place was spotless with every employee in there bored and cleaning tables over and over. Not once did anyone ask how our food was or our experience - not even the manager who was there. I ordered the pesto chicken sandwich and the cream of broccoli soup. My sandwich had no pesto on it, it was completely dry. One half of my sandwich had a total of 5 of the saddest tiny pieces of chicken I've ever seen. It wasn't anywhere close to covering the bread. So I combined that chicken with the other half to make one good half sandwich. I went to the counter to tell them my sandwich had no pesto (thinking its new restaurant growing pains) and the girl proceeds to tell me it's actually a pesto butter and that next time I need to ask for extra if I want more. Ok? Once I added this and the chicken, my half sandwich was pretty good. The soup was not warm, it's probably been sitting in its vat for hours since the place is dead. It was gross.  I also got a chocolate covered strawberry with walnuts - which, much to my dismay, was soggy and did not taste good. It must have been sitting on the shelf too long.  The only positive thing I have to say is the place was so clean since all the workers were bored and cleaned the empty restaurant the whole time.   I might try the place again in a few months if they're not out of business.

The 2 most important things in a restaurant is food and ambiance - and Okra hit it out of the park! I went with my friend and we pigged out! We got the mussels to start (phenomenal) and the bone marrow which is not something I would order on my own but oh my gosh, be adventurous and eat this! The jam, oxtail, bone marrow and biscuit all in one bite - to die for!   Then I got the Umbrian fried chicken - the BEST fried chicken I've ever had. Great seasoning and SO crispy. Yum! My friend ordered the pork - it was huge! The size of her head! The meat was delicious, very tender and juicy, great flavor. The only downside of this is we ordered the mashed potatoes as a side and they came out lukewarm and bland. The texture was like instant mashed potatoes, too. Very thin and watery. But that's not enough to make this review less than 5 stars cause everything else was exceptional - even my Pimm's cup drink was super yummy! Great date place - be it with a significant other or a friend. I'll definitely be back.
