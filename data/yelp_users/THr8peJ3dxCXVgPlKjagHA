This place is a Phoenix institution and has been in operation for 33 years! The dishes are inexpensive, great sized portions and full of flavour.  For around $5 you can get a big bowl of rice and teriyaki chicken, for a dollar more, beef or fish. The panko chicken is excellent and comes with a choice of three sauces. My girlfriend's favourite is the vegetable bowl, which comes in under $5! She loves it. Appetizers are also inexpensive - 4 gyoza with pork or shrimp for under $1.79 and 3 spring rolls for $1.39. The sushi is a bit boring, although again, very inexpensive.  The service is amazing - personable, engaging and friendly. Decor is a bit dated, but that doesn't bother me. I'd rather the prices stay low than pay a premium for fancy booths and a mural of Mount Fuji.  I only wish they stayed open a little later than 6:30....

I'm done with the antiquated Turkish bazaar style of sales "technique" car dealerships provide. In this day and age we shouldn't have to spend multiple hours going back and forth just to make a purchase. Sitting in empty offices while the salesperson disappears to "talk to my manager" - don't BS me, I've seen Fargo, I know what you are really doing.  Everyone uses the internet to research the type of car they want, you can look up the MPG, the cargo room, the legroom. You know what colours are available and what trims. You can even look at the dealer website and see what inventory is in stock, complete with accessories and MSRP* (The Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price excludes destination freight charge, tax, title, license, dealer fees and optional equipment. See your dealer for details)  So I had gone onto the GMC website, found the exact model of vehicle I wanted to buy with the exact specifications that fit my need and my budget. I got a generic email from John, the Coulter Internet Manager telling me he's my man. There were two models listed in stock, so I sent an email to him with the VINs of the cars I was interested in, together with the make model and mileage of my trade-in. I never heard anything back.  So a couple of days later I walk into Coulter. This is not your typical dealership with hundreds of cars on the lot, there are maybe 6 cars out front and a couple more in the showroom. Imagine the scene - I walk into the showroom which has car salesmen all hanging around each others desks, chewing the fat and yucking it up. They scatter like cockroaches when I walk in. An older gentleman approaches me,   You looking for parts? No, I want to buy a car Well if you are looking for parts, it's down that way No, I want to buy a car Oh, come this way  That's how I met Dean. Dean has a PhD. I know this because it's on his business card AND on the door plate to his office. Don't ask for Dean if you are in a rush, because he moves like molasses. Up we go in an elevator, through a door to a second floor garage. We are looking for the car I am interested in. Dean is half listening to me. I tell him that I have the exact car I need to see. I tell him that according to your website you have two in stock, one silver and one white. Let's find either of them. He doesn't know where they are. We look in the garage; we look out on the lot. We go back down the elevator to his office. I give him the VINs, he disappears, comes back and off we go to try and find either of the two cars. After much searching and much shuffling we find one of them, out on a parking lot, behind the service area, mixed in with private cars and one with the whole side missing. Yep, you guessed it, Dean doesn't have the keys.  When he finally returns with the keys, he reluctantly takes me on a test drive. No you can't drive it out of the lot, we have security. Where is this security when we were looking for the car? Maybe they can instigate a search for the white one I was really interested in. We then go on the most pedestrian test drive ever. No freeway exposure, just literally around the block. I'm driving a V6 I want to let it go, see what it can do, but nope.  So the car drives well, the MSRP is right. All that is needed now is to work out how much they are going to give me for my trade-in. As a good internet user I have researched the Kelly Blue Book value of my car. The KBB trade-in value is low, I expect that. They offer a range based on the condition of the car, from a low number if the car is ready for the scrapheap, to a high number if it is in pristine condition. I figure I'm somewhere in the middle. But it is what it is and with the range in hand we begin the negotiations. Cue Dean's exit again, this time with my car keys.  At first he can't get the VIN entered into his computer, so he figures he wrote it down wrong, then he takes his iPhone and snaps a photo of it, that doesn't work. He asks me if I have my insurance card and he reads the VIN off that. Finally, he gets the computer to accept the number. Lots of button pushing ensues, then he curses the printer, then he prints something, then he's off again.  When Dean finally returns, he has a price for me. $2,000 less than the low price on my range! Are you kidding me? At least he doesn't try to spin me a line about the age of the car or the condition. Just this is the price, take it or leave it. I say I'll leave it. This is a critical time in the car sales negotiation process, I waited half a second and then it came.  "What can we do to get you in a new car today?"  I said you can stop insulting me with that price and offer something within the KBB range. Ok, he says, "Let me go talk to my manager". So Dean makes his final departure. When he returns he shakes my hand and says we are getting nowhere, just wasting each other's time and goodbye.  So here I am, three hours later no further forward in the car buying process than I was before.   Sigh. I wish Amazon sold cars

Spent some time here waiting for my knives to be sharpened next door. The beer was cold, the (famous) wings looked and smelled amazing and the bartender was super personable. There were a few TVs tuned to the sports. It has an odd little patio outside with a couple of tables, but multiple signs telling you not to bring your drinks outside.   It is definitely a locals hang-out with the guy sitting next to me at the bar trying to remember the name of an Arcadia nightclub from 1990 which "used to be great until it turned a bit knifey" The bartender and the local struggled with the name. I was of no help. I Googled "knifey Arcadia nightclub" without success. I left before they could get it, so I don't know if they ever figured it out. If, by chance you do know the answer, please stop in here and tell them - they are probably still trying to remember.

Finding the address is easy (just follow 7th Street), finding the restaurant a little trickier as you have to drive past the entrance to the hotel first and not be tempted to nab one of the open parking spots - you've got a ways to go yet. Keep ascending and eventually, when your car has almost given out on you, you'll find Different Point of View.   Valet was free and friendly. Up one flight of stairs and you'll find yourself in the bar. Up one more flight of stairs and you'll find the restaurant.  Décor is classy, but a little dated. Of course, not many people will be looking at the furniture when they see the view. A floor to ceiling glass window facing south, with downtown Phoenix in the distance. We were lucky enough to get one of the tables by the window as we had an earlier reservation (6:30) in order to see the sunset. There is a patio outside which would be a great location to sit and watch the sun go down, if only it wasn't 110 outside!  The wine list is very good, and expansive. There seems to be something for everyone, from multiple thousand dollar bottles of Premier Cru Bordeauxs to more affordable domestic wines. The only comment I would make is that there wasn't as much variety in the by-the-glass selection.  In addition the the regular menu, they offer a three course prix fixe deal for $40  - select the options that are printed in red and the selections were surprisingly good. The second prix fixe option is the Chef's choice seven course meal for $79pp with the option to add a wine pairing for an additional $29pp. The table next to ours had the Chef's choice and it seemed to be a great deal. We weren't that hungry and the OH wasn't drinking, so we chose the 3-course menu.  For apps the OH ordered the watermelon salad, which was good, but a little boring. A slice of seared watermelon and some mustard greens or rape. I ordered the lobster bisque and thought it was excellent, but would have liked to have seen some lobster meat instead of everything being puréed. It had a great flavour.  For entrées I had the daily addition, which tonight was Beef Short Ribs - delectable, melt in your mouth, amazing. She ordered the Trout which was perfectly cooked and served on a bed of shrimp and enoki mushrooms.  Dessert was Classic Tahitian Vanilla Bean Crème Brulee and Chocolate Turtle. They were both good, but the crème brulee was in a league of it's own. You can see why it is their signature dessert!  Service was very good and my water glass was never close to empty. Luis was our server and he told us he had worked there for 11 years, he said there were other servers who had worked there for much longer. His service was very professional, although a little pandering at times.  Summary - This is a great place for a date night. It's romantic, the service is good, the food very good and the view spectacular. You should go.

Bait & Switch.  Audi USA is offering a lease deal on a Q5. Audi North Scottsdale would not even get close to the price. Spent a good two hours playing the "Let me go check with my manager" routine and "That deal is different" and "There are hidden costs in that" Completely wasted my time and to be honest, put me off Audi as a brand.

It's almost impossible to give a 5 star rating to a car dealership, because although this place was miles better than previous places I had visited, it's in their nature to try to pull a fast one on an unsuspecting customer. They are the scorpion, but I refused to be the frog.    I had sent a few emails back and forth to John Skoko before I arrived. I told him I didn't want any games, just to buy a car. True to his word when we arrived he had the keys to the car we were interested in and we went for a test drive which included the freeway. John was knowledgeable about the vehicle, he knew the features and the specifications. He was patient and engaging.  When it came time to talk numbers and play the game, negotiations almost went south with some hidden mystery fees that even the manager  didn't know what they were for. "Every dealership charges that", they said, but were silent when I asked exactly what it was. That's the state charging that, not us, they claimed, but quickly contradicted themselves when I asked for the fees to be itemized. After some back and forth they were taken off. I might be from England, but I didn't come over on the last boat.    Once we got everything squared away I got the deal that was advertised on the GMC website. That's all I wanted. But I did have to put up a fight. All in all it took four hours from walking in to driving off in a new car. Almost, but not completely painless.

What a cool bar!   I had been driving around the neighbourhood, doing some shopping, and was in need of a quick adult beverage. Open the Yelp app (of course!) and up pops this gem.  Plenty of parking behind the bar, inside has vintage video games, pool tables and lots of TVs. The bartender was Paula (I love it when bartenders introduce themselves, it's classy and makes it easier to ask for another drink) She was very friendly and personable and let me know that they were running a lunch time special of a burger or two tacos for a dollar, but that time was about to end. I ordered the tacos and they were great. Not just "great for a dollar" great, but genuinely great.  Background music was at a normal level and they seemed to have a good selection of liquors. Only weird thing was no tap beer. That seemed a little odd to me, but whatevs.

Had takeout from here twice and dined-in for the first time last night - so time for a review!  This place has certainly seen the the neighbourhood change since it opened in 1969. While the fabric shop has been replaced by a liquor store and the wig store replaced by Llantera El Rincon Tires and Rims, La Piñata remains constant, serving Sonoran Mexican cuisine and famous for it's Chimichanga. If you are struggling to find La Piñata, it's right across the street from Vlad's Barbershop (who also buys gold)  Service has always been very friendly here with the owner(?) always happy to strike up a conversation about the weather or the utility companies or the state of the nation. The hostesses and the servers are customer orientated too.  In my three visits I've had the Beef Asada Burro, the Chicken Quesadilla and the Shrimp Baja. The first thing worth mentioning is the portion size, absolutely massive! Certainly enough to make a meal again the next day. The burro was packed with heaps of meat, perfectly cooked and seasoned, onions, tomatoes, cilantro - excellent. There are two chicken quesadillas on the menu, Charbroiled or Machacadilla. The charbroiled is only meat, the machacadilla adds veggies. The choice is yours, they are both great. The shrimp for the Shrimp Baja was very good, although it was probably my least favourite of the three dishes and lacked a punch.  Great Mexican beer selection (plus Bud Light if you prefer to drink water!) and although we didn't have one, the margaritas looked amazing. The place is obviously very popular because the restaurant was almost full when we came in around 6pm and the tables turned while we were there.

As oil change joints go, this place is pretty decent. The facility was clean, the coffee was free (and looked like it had been brewed the same week), the service was fast and the staff were friendly.  There is always going to be the upsell song and dance routine, but at least they didn't try to get me with the old "look at your filthy air filter" trick. They did tack on an extra few dollars for additional oil and a "premium" oil filter, but overall it was pretty painless.  A week later and there isn't oil all over my driveway, so at least I know they put everything back together in the right place!

This is your proverbial "special occasion" restaurant. It's the place to take someone you want to impress. You may see politicians and judges in one corner, football players in another and maybe even a socialite or two (you'll know them because they don't take their sunglasses off, either because they are too cool, or the botox hasn't settled yet)  The valet parking is free, which is cool, but you don't have to use them, the parking lot is huge and you can self-park. Entering through the kitchen is a unique touch, but remember to open the door on the right to avoid bumping into a server coming the opposite way!  The interior is old-school and dated, but harks back to the days of old. Red plush couches and velvet curtains. Dark wooden tables and booths.  Robert was our server and he was excellent. Very personable and engaging. He knew when to come to the table and when to stay away. An awareness skill that other servers could learn.  The food was very good, which is only to be expected given the history of the place, but the prices were outrageous! The shrimp cocktail was $17.50 (5 U10s or U12s), served on the rim of an oversized martini glass over cocktail sauce, just like your grandma used to make back in 1976. The crabcake app was full of meat, priced at $19.95.  For entrées my gf got the salmon ($33.50) and I got the 12 oz filet ($60.50). To be fair, the entrées do include soup or salad and starch, but no sides. Robert asked us if it was our first time, and when we said it was, he bought us a dessert. That was a nice touch.  The bargain of the night was the wine list. We selected a 2003 Jordan cab, which was only $63. Robert expertly decanted the wine and it tasted great.  Would I go back again? Absolutely! But only if it was on an expense account or a long-lost rich uncle was picking up the tab.

Let me preface this review by saying that for the past 2 years I have lived in Boston, which has some decent Chinese restaurants, great food, but rude/curt/abrupt service. I had learned to keep my head down, not make eye contact and not ask any questions. Eat as fast as possible and get the hell out before someone starts yelling at you!  So understandably my guard was up when I entered Mu Shu Asian Grill. However, complete opposite here. Mr Mu Shu welcomed me to his establishment, asked me if I had ever been here before and took the time to explain the stir fry/salad bar station.  I was in the mood for Mu Shu, and a place named Mu Shu must have great Mu Shu, right? Mr MS described to me his version of MS, I heard him say something about a burrito, but I really wasn't paying too much attention as I smugly thought I knew everything there was to know about Mu Shu! Boy was I wrong! When I get it, it's bigger than my forearm. It's packed full of shrimp, veggies and fried rice. Wow, what a great flavour!  You've heard of Asian fusion? This is Mexasian!

Overall a very nice experience, with a couple of missteps.   I was treated by my fiancee to the Brick Oven Dinner to celebrate my birthday. The location is great. Close enough to the freeway to make it an easy trip from downtown Phoenix, but definitely in the country.  Blink and you might miss the sign to the farm, but follow the track to the very end and you will find many choices. Quiessence is one of the choices (on the left)  The table for the Brick Oven Dinner is very cute. Set apart from the rest of the tables under a canopy and of course the oven, with heaters on either side, which we needed later on. You really feel like a VIP sitting there.  Our server was very knowledgeable of the menu, but at times a little robotic. Another server who would pop by from time to time was a little more authentic. She engaged in conversation with us and added more logs to the fire where needed.  The meal got off to a bit of a rocky start when she got my drink wrong. I ordered a Gibson, she brought a Gimlet. No big deal, she'll switch it out. But then she comes back and says she doesn't have any cocktail onions, so I settle for a regular martini instead.  The premise of the Brick Oven menu is that it's Chef's Choice. He'll work around your allergies, restrictions and preferences to create a customized menu just for you. Sounds great! One vegetarian, one meat eater, no allergies please!  I realized while researching the writing of this review that what I received was almost exactly the same as Yelper Dave G. received. So I will defer to his review for most of the descriptions (plus photos for every course).  http://www.yelp.com/biz/quiessence-restaurant-phoenix?hrid=FhTlYlSYw_vQPUWBHO0tnA  Here's what we got -   Amuse Bouche - little shooter of chilled apple soup. mine had an oyster, her's didn't.  1. Charcuterie & Cheese. Nicely separated with the meat on my side and the cheese on hers. This course took FOREVER to come out. We would have been there for 8 hours if the pacing for each subsequent course had been the same as this one  2. Parsnip Soup - mine had bacon, her's didn't  3. Beet Salad & Seasonal Vegetables  4. I received the Wagyu Capaccio. This was my favourite dish of the night. She received the himachi crudo minus the himachi. The server said this dish was her favourite, but she had never seen it without the fish. Looked a little sad  5. Potato Gnocchi. Mine came with hen, her's didn't. Light and excellent. Highly recommend  6. For the entree I received chicken scallopini. I was a little disappointed with this course. Reading Rob's review (which had been identical up until this point) this was a letdown. She got a plate of vegetables.  7 & 8 - Not sure if they were getting tired of us, or if they wanted to go home, but courses 7 and 8 came at the same time. Panna Cotta with a blackberry soup; apple marscapone cannoli (excellent!) and dulce de leche bread pudding (very good)  We ordered coffees, one regular and one decaf and they were both cold. As we were literally the last people in the joint, we didn't ask for a replacement, plus she had already dropped the check right after the desserts, so the message was clear.  So, overall a 4-star experience. For the most part excellent food although I felt they took some lazy short cuts with the vegetarian options and I really don't know why the charcuterie board took close to an hour to arrive! Service was mostly good, although I felt rushed at the end which shouldn't be the case when you are paying $120 per head plus drinks.

It's no great surprise that when a company has a monopoly on a market or product that their customer service sucks. They really don't have to give a shit because what else can the consumer do? We can't buy our gas from anywhere else? We can't tell them to stick their "all-day appointment windows" up their ass. What do they care that the "operators are currently busy"? They have zero incentive to hire more staff or train them better.   Here's the biggest insult, Southwest Gas, you're worse than Comcast.

"Your dog eats better than you do."  That's what my fiancée says and she's probably right.   Hobe, in addition to all the great cuts of meat that they have for humans, also have an amazing selection of raw dog food. Chicken, beef, turkey, duck, lamb, veggie. All pre-packaged in one pound tubs, all natural, perfect for my ever-growing fang puppy. They also have marrow and knuckle bones and turkey and chicken necks.  If you buy in quantity, no need to pull it from the freezer yourself, just ask them and they will grab it from the back and sometimes even walk it to your car for you. They offer a discount for cash and are always very friendly. Sign up for their monthly email for other specials too!

No doubt the pizza is excellent here, but the service sucks! The first time I went there, there was a line outside the door. To their credit both registers were manned, but when it came to be my turn, the cashier (Asian female) decided she didn't want to do any more work and just wandered off. When she decided to come back, she spent the next 15 minutes chatting to her friend on her phone. Eventually she decided to serve me and got the order wrong. Gee thanks for nothing lady.   The second time I decided to call the order in. Hello Z Pizza, can you hold? Can you hold some more? Hello can you hold? Unfortunately they don't wait for you to answer before putting you on hold, so you are SOL. I began the call when I was a 30 minute drive from the place and finished the call in their parking lot. I walk in expecting the place to be slammed, but no, it's dead. More employees than customers and guess what, they're chat, chat, chatting away - with each other.   This place would be great with an effective manager in place. Or maybe just any manager

I'm often dubious when I read reviews that mention people by name. They are almost always Spelp (Spam+Yelp). So I was naturally apprehensive when ALL the reviews here talk about Barry this and Barry that.  Except, this place IS the exception. It's Barry's store and wouldn't be what it is without Barry and his unique personality. He is chatty, friendly, knowledgeable and very experienced. It doesn't hurt either that his quality is great and the prices are amazing.  I'm in a suit every day and was looking to add 2 new suits to my wardrobe. Barry instantly knew my size and had me trying on jackets within minutes. Two great suits, including alterations and tax was less than $400 - that's about the same as one lesser quality suit at Jos A Banks or Men's Wearhouse.  Thanks Barry!

The problem is the pitch. Not the perceived frequency of sound, rather the steepness of a slope or an object confirming to a slope.  Acoustically this place is great, the sound is wonderful, everywhere from Millionaire Row at the front, to Paupers Pews at the back.   If you come to listen to the symphony, then relax in your comfortable seat, close your eyes and you're all set. However, if you come to watch something or other moving about on the stage, then cross your fingers and hope you don't get a seat behind an adult sized human, because if you do, he or she will be all you are looking at for the duration of the show. The oompa loompa sized architects really didn't take into account anyone over the height of, what, maybe 5 foot when they designed this place. Or maybe the first show was The Hobbit and they figured everything was ok.  Good for Kids? - Only if they are sitting in front of you, not if you are one.

I'm guessing someone at Sears has been reading these reviews, because I was greeted by no fewer than 6 different associates as I browsed the aisles looking for a washer, a dryer and a refrigerator. It was almost to the point of annoying.   I almost didn't come here based on these reviews, but a friend said they got a great deal on a fridge, so after checking prices online and taking a trip to Home Depot, I stopped by.   I agree with other reviewers who said the washer and dryer sets should be easier to find. It's quite frustrating when you find the perfect dryer, not to know if the matching washer was here. Eventually I did find a matching set at a great price with unnoticeable cosmetic damage. The associate was quite helpful, but didn't offer to check the inventory on the computer which would have saved some time.   I also bought a fridge. I found the perfect model with a dinged door and right next to it the exact same model with a dinged drawer. I asked the guy if we could switch the drawer and make the perfect fridge, but he said no. I said I would pay more for it, he checked in the back with the manager and came back and said no again. I was disappointed that the manager wouldn't engage in some negotiations, but whatever.   In the end I found a similar refrigerator at a good price, so bought that instead. Delivery was $83 for all 3 items and includes installation which I thought was fair.   I will update after everything has been delivered, installed and working.

I'm a big Yelper. I look to Yelp to stave my hunger, to quench my thirst, to pique my curiosity. When I am in need of anything I look to Yelp.  My girlfriend is a bit more traditional and although she has one Yelp review to her name, will often look to more old fashioned methods of recommendations when she needs something. We are expecting our first child, and she wanted to look for a well respected daycare. So she subscribed to A****'s L**t. After she had paid the $39 annual fee she searched for daycare and found ZERO results in our area. So much for "Reviews you can Trust" We also get a monthly catalogue full of AL ads - it's great for kindling.  One day I was lighting a fire in the back yard and one of the pages of the AL catalogue caught my eye - Emergency Family Movers, $49 per hour. This is about half of the going rate for a reputable moving company. Of course the first thing I did was hop on Yelp to see if they were the real deal and yes they are!  I hate moving. I have moved a lot in my life and have had the luxury of having my company move me. It's a great perk. I just sit back and someone packs all my boxes, protects my valuables and takes it all away. When I reach the new city I pick up the phone and my furniture is delivered and the boxes unpacked. Unfortunately, my company only pays for cross-country moves. I wanted to stay in Phoenix and move into a bigger house for the impending arrival of the little one. EFM were great!  They arrived on time, the two guys were pleasant, but with minimal English. It's really not that important as moving uses a universal language. Their truck looked a bit ghetto, but it did what it needed to do for my cross-city move. They were quick and efficient, there were no hidden charges or surprises and even when the final time went over by about ten minutes they rounded down! Who does that?  They were very careful with everything and were happy to put the boxes in whichever room I asked them to. It was a pleasure to work with them and I made sure to tip them accordingly! They were happy to take payment by credit card, they just called it into the office. no big deal.  (One minor point, and not worth docking a star, was that when we were booking them they didn't send a confirmation email confirming our booking. They said they don't do that. I had visions of them forgetting all about us on move day, but those fears were completely unfounded. Might be a good policy to implement though, for your customers peace of mind)

Just stopped in for a quick drink before dinner across the street, so can't comment on the food (although what I saw go by me looked great and smelled fabulous!)   The bartender was attentive, the beer selection was sufficiently eclectic without bordering on hipster and the prices were right.  I would go again, probably to eat next time.

The biodome is not a zoo, and it's not quite a botanical gardens.  We came this past weekend and found the longest line I have ever seen in my life. There were people everywhere. The line went all the way around the biodome, to the theater, then back again. We had paid for a taxi there, so we had little choice but to wait in line. It moved fast-ish though, I'd say we were outside for about an hour.  Once we got in I realized why there were so many people there - it was free day. So the good news was that there was no charge, the bad news was that because it was free there were thousands upon thousands of people there. Many more than I am sure is normal.  Antarctic area was closed, so that congested the people even more and it was not at all an enjoyable experience. We were just a body of smelly humanity that surged forward en masse. There was no space or time to enjoy any of the exhibits.  But what am I going to do? Ask for my money back?

This place is huge and has the most amazing patio. Unfortunately, we had dinner reservations and couldn't spend much time here.  Stupid us sat at the main bar inside, but we kept seeing people going through the bar and out through a back door. It wasn't until we were ready to leave that we decided to have a lookie-loo and see where everyone was going.  What we found was the most amazing garden patio. Think New Orleans garden patio, but 10 times bigger, with bars and trees and tables and benches. I wish we could have spent more time here, but we had to run.  I've bookmarked it though, and I will be back.

Mimosa pitchers - while a little pricy at $45 are worth every penny! Freshly squeezed OJ and fruity champagne - we got 2!  The eggs benedict was probably the best I have ever had, the eggs were cooked perfectly - so often they are not.  Our server was also a delight, funny and witty. The manager even came over to assist us with tourist suggestions.  I don't know how it happened, but we managed to walk right in and snag a table without a wait during brunch on a weekend!  Don't go to Montreal without going here.

The only reservations that were available on Saturday night were at 10pm and we were lucky to get them. When we left 2+ hours later, people were still being seated for dinner!  A very affordable bistro that is really easy to miss if you are not paying attention as it is not very well signposted.  The foix gras was incredible, the steak frites probably one of the best I've ever had and the creme caramel a l'orange was exquisite.   Service was friendly and efficient and I even learned that rare is saignant in French.

A quaint building houses one of Canada's best steak houses. Rural old-world charm. Wooden tables, comfortable plush chairs and dimly-lit dining areas give this restaurant a romantic feel.  Reservations weren't difficult to get on a Sunday night when called in the day before, although we were told to come at 8-ish. We were seated promptly when we arrived at 8pm.  The server brought fresh bread, jumbo pickles and a ramekin of bacon crumbles to the table when we sat down. Pickles seems to be a Montreal tradition, but I've never seen bacon served with bread before, but when in Rome! It did add an extra dimension to the bread though.  Appetizers consisted of escargot bourguignonne and mussels provencale. The escargot was excellent, very tender, prepared in the traditional way with garlic, shallots and white wine; served out of the shell in the usual escargot dish. The mussels were baked instead of the more familiar steamed, with tomatoes, herbs and garlic and more bacon!  All entrees include a choice of Gibby's salad or gazpacho and are served with a starch choice of baked potato, Monte Carlo potato or rice pilaf. The Monte Carlo potato is similar to a twice-baked potato with cheese and chives. Asparagus was also included.  We ordered the filet and the petit filet. The regular filet was massive. I would guess a good 14-16 ounces. The petite had to be at least 10. They are on the expensive side, but given the size and the included salad, starch and vegetable it worked out to be good value for money. The steaks were tender and cooked to the correct temperature and the Montreal style seasoning (pepper, onion, garlic) made them delicious.  We rounded off the meal with a shared triple chocolate dessert, which was delightful. We passed on the offer of table-side flaming coffees ($14ea), but the table next to us did order, so we got to see the show.  Service was good, but the server would often disappear for extended periods of time between courses. The tobacco smell emanating from her clothing told us where she had been....

This was may first stop after arriving in Montreal and it was a great indicator of what a wonderful weekend lay ahead.  We snagged an open table for three as we arrived and ordered one of their 3 liter beer towers. I can't remember what kind of beer we ordered, but we asked the server for a local recommendation and it was really good. I love the concept.  The clientele was a mix of college-age kids and folks a little bit older like us. The main difference here between a Canadian bar and a US bar is that everyone here was having a great time. No pushing, no shoving, no angry interactions, just everyone enjoying themselves. There really is something to be said about the drinking age being 18.  What makes this a five star review was our server. She was both friendly and super efficient. As my friend and I drank beer from the tower, girly (who doesn't drink beer) drank bacardi & diet. As soon as her drink was almost done, the server would be at our table asking if we wanted more. This was no mean feat as the place was packed and she was busy!  **I have her name on the receipt, but I don't have it with me. I will update this review with it as she deserves the recognition.  As for the other review mentioning the music choice, dude, it's a jukebox! If you don't like the music, use the power of the dollar and make your voice heard!  UPDATE: Server's name was Jacqueline! Thanks for the great service!

Not sure if the price has gone down, but we only paid $5 pp to enter this magnificent basilica and it is worth every penny. It truly is spectacular.  The tour is 20 minutes, which is the perfect length. Our tour guide was informative and friendly. We got to see the main building and the chapel behind and learn the history.  The architecture is beautiful. The murals, stained glass and statues are very impressive.  You don't have to be religious to come here, just a lover of beauty. A trip to Montreal would not be complete without a visit here.

This place is super cute. An historic home converted into a bar/coffee shop/cafe/live music venue.   They have a surprising large bottled beer selection including a lot of microbrews. This past Sunday they had a beer of the day for only $2, not sure if that is an every day event, but it was a great deal. When the cashier told me she was out of the beer of the day, she said I could substitute for any other beer for the same price - sweet!  Service was very friendly, so whatever problems they may have had in the past they seem to have fixed (or fired!) The seating is cosy, albeit limited. The patio is a nice touch when the weather cooperates. There is artwork for sale on the walls, but struggling artists won't be struggling for long if they sell them at those prices! The problem is, they probably won't sell because of the prices, so the artists will remain struggling.  The menu leans to the healthy side, but not to the extent of chickpea and cardboard burgers at Pita Jungle (thank god!). I think they call the sandwiches "Artisan" which is apt. The portions are big and the prices reasonable. I had the Smokey Joe on my last visit and a Reuben the previous time. I think the Reuben was the sandwich of the day, didn't see it on the regular menu this time. Both sandwiches were great.   The only negative is the parking. There is a little parking lot behind Hob Nobs, but because 3rd Ave is a one way street going the opposite way from McDowell, you will have to navigate around the neighbourhood a little before you find it. Then you'll find it to be full and you will curse Phoenix's one way streets and drive around the neighbourhood one more time to try and find street parking. It's worth the hassle though.

I'm sure the food is great, I'm sure the service is great. Why the one-star review? They didn't have a highchair. I'm sorry if this comes across as entitled, but I didn't see a big sign on the door saying children not welcome, but by choosing not to purchase a $50 highchair, that's exactly what you're saying.  We planned to have dinner with our well behaved, non-vomiting, non-screaming one-year-old, but by sending that very clear message that we are not welcome, guess what, we left and went somewhere else.

It's a DMV. Don't expect friendly service, fast service, or honestly any service.   You go to the information counter when you first arrive and the girl checks that you have all your information in order. She will then give you a number. They are very smart with the number system, it's not your typical 1-1000, it's random blocks of 100's. This gives the illusion that your wait is not going to be as long as it really is. But it's just an illusion.  Kudos for licenses lasting until you retire. Boo for the fact that SB 1070 means that my license only lasts until the expiration of my green card.  Also, while I was there the ID printer broke down, and when it was finally repaired they "lost" my application.

So here's another place where the food is excellent, but the front-of-house is seriously lacking.  We've just had a baby, so dining out has (temporarily) been replaced by taking out. We still enjoy the food we used to, only we now get to pause eating when the little bundle of joy decides he's hungry or needs changing, or if the wind blows in the wrong direction. Because he is quite vocal in letting us know. We could, of course, become "those people" who really don't care about the tranquility of others when dining out, but we chose not to be.  Gallo Blanco has a great website with the menu items listed in detail, they offer quite the selection with reasonable prices. They support to-go orders and even offer curbside pickup! That is of course IF you can get through to them.  I called the number listed on their website at about 4pm and the call goes straight to voicemail. "Leave a message if you want to make a reservation". Hmmm, thinking I'd mistakenly called the reservations number, I checked their website and the to-go number is the same as the reservations number which is the same as the main number - it is THE number. I tried a few more times, but it would always go directly to voicemail with nairy a ring. I even tried to call the hotel main number, which was answered, and asked to be transferred to the restaurant, but again I got the dreaded voicemail of death. I called the hotel back and told them my dilemma, but they were all out of options. Hmmmm...  We had our hearts set on the menu items we had chosen that I decided to drive there and have a happy-hour beer while I waited. Inside is a bit odd. I entered through the To-Go Door. They have a counter where you can sit, which at first glance could be mistaken for a bar, but it isn't. There was an open seat, so I sat at the pseudo-bar and waited, and waited, and waited some more. The problem with it not being a bar is that there is no-one permanently stationed there. Sure, plenty of people came back and forth because it is right in front of the kitchen, but no-one came to take my order. Directly to the left is a host station with two greeters (but no phone!) The place was busy, but these two were just standing around making high-school chat.  Finally I was able to flag someone down, not the first four or five people as they just ignored me and kept on trucking, but someone who was able to take my order and no, they couldn't explain why the phone went directly to voicemail, nor did they really care.  So, in summary - the food is great, if you can get it.

What else can be said about the wonderful little restaurant that hasn't been said already?  We were able to make reservations on Open Table for 7:30 on a Saturday night. We arrived on time, and the restaurant was full. The host was very apologetic and asked us if we minded waiting at the bar for a few minutes until the table was ready. We didn't mind at all. The bartender was engaging and make a mean French cocktail. Once the table freed up, they brought us over and gave us two complimentary glasses of champagne - classy touch.  For apps we got the escargot and steak tartar. Little disappointed the escargot had already been removed from their shells, but they tasted amazing none the less. The tartar was served with a perfectly cooked duck's egg.  For entrées OH ordered the scallop special and boy were they big and tasty! Unusually for me I did not order the steak frites, having been persuaded by the waiter that the lamb chops were to die for. He was not wrong, they were quite possibly the biggest lamb chops I have ever seen, obviously from some mutant, but super tasty, sheep.  Dessert had to be the soufflé - top tip: order when you get your entrées as this baked delight takes a little while. But again, our waiter was on top of it for us.  The patio looked very romantic, but obviously too hot in July. I'll be sure to come back when the weather cools off and ask to sit outside.

I'm done with this company.   I buy a case of wine every couple of weeks and after yesterday's miserable experience, I will be shopping somewhere else from now on.  First, their website sucks. Even after an "upgrade" it still takes forever to load, constantly times out and you have to press the submit button multiple times (at the risk of being charged multiple times) to get your order in.   Whenever I am ordering my wine I spend time researching the scores and ratings. I ALWAYS uncheck the box that will allow vintage substitutions. I know that a wine that is fantastic one year could be vinegar the next. I can guarantee that when I get to the store at least one of the wines will be of the incorrect vintage. Yesterday six of the twelve bottles was the wrong vintage! 50% failure rate! This happens every single time. They have every excuse under the sun - website inventory was wrong, the picker wasn't paying attention, thought you wouldn't mind, etc, etc.  So as I find the 6 incorrect bottles and tell the large guy with the scruffy red beard, he starts to give me attitude!   I will purposely drive across the valley to go to a different store than to ever give Total Wine any more of my business.

So you get yourself a puppy or an adult dog and you find yourself with two choices.  1. Don't train your dog. Let him/her run around and do what it wants, jump up on people, eat your furniture, bite people, pull your arm out of its socket when you walk him, etc, etc.   2. Go to dog training classes.   Yeah, number 2 is the right answer. For a very reasonable price ($125) we signed up Anka our brand new 3 month old puppy. Anka is a strong-willed German Shepherd with a high drive and before training was happy to do anything SHE wanted to. After completing our 8 week training class, Anka can now sit, down, wait, stay on command and come when called. She walks on a leash wonderfully now. She doesn't jump up on people any more and she is a lot more comfortable amongst other dogs and people.  Leah is very knowledgeable and patient. She spends time both with the class as a whole and with your dog individually. Every one of the dogs in our class improved dramatically over the course of 8 weeks. The transformation was quite amazing to see.  I picked Leah because of her history with German Shepherds, but she knows about all dogs. We were so happy with the puppy class that, without hesitation, signed up for the intermediate class and probably the advanced class after that!

Some great BBQ here. I got the combo plate with ribs and pulled pork. I loved them both. The coleslaw was good too, KFC style. The "house" beer (PBR) was only a couple of bucks.  Place is clean and bright and even has a couple of tables outside.  The only drawback (and I know I will get some s**t for this) is that there isn't really anything on the menu for our vegetarian friends. The girlfriend settled on a salad, but they all had meat, and when we asked for the meat to be taken off, there was no price adjustment. Not the biggest deal-breaker in the world, but still a little annoying.

Perfect.  I really could finish the review right there, but for the sake of clarity I will continue.   Season's 52 name comes from the fact that it changes the menu seasonally and they have 52 wines available by the glass. In addition to the seasonality of the menu, they have an extensive list of specials which changes weekly. There are also changing wine selections. No item on the menu is more than 475 calories, which is pretty amazing.  Our server was Ryan and he was epitome of excellence. Engaging, friendly, there when we needed him, away when we didn't. Knowledgeable of the menu, including the wine list.  I selected a glass of gamay from the sommelier's recommended list and it didn't disappoint.  We ordered the lobster and shrimp flatbread appetizer which was light and delicious, with just a hint of cilantro.  For a starter the gf ordered the beets - tasted great but the presentation was a bit boring. I had the steamed shrimp spring rolls and they were fresh and served with three dipping sauces.  For entrées my vegetarian gf was in heaven and had quite the selection to choose from. She ended up with the seasonal vegetable plate (no surprise, right?) - she was very impressed by both the portion size and the selection (given the 475 calorie limit). I had the rainbow trout served with roasted vegetables and the fish separated from the skin effortlessly and was fresh and moist.  For dessert we selected two of the mini indulgences, which for only $2.50 each are a perfect size and price for the sweet finish to a great meal.  It wasn't until the next day that I found out that Season's 52 is a chain and owned by Darden's (of Olive Garden fame). This really surprised me as it didn't look like a chain and the food and service aren't anything you would associate with a chain, so kudos for them for a job well done.

Pedestrian and boring Thai food for the masses. If your idea of exotic is Pad Thai, then this is the place for you. No heat, no flavour, no imagination.  Server lacked enthusiasm, obviously a common trend here throughout the restaurant.

You're probably not coming here by choice. You're probably coming here because your favourite band is playing here and you would go to anywhere your favourite band is playing, right?  But this really is a place that makes an effort to bring you back (and I have!). From the polite bouncers to the engaging ticket collector, from the servers to the bartenders, everyone is nice here. it's a refreshing change.  Food is good but not great. It's Mexican food and there is no shortage of that around here. Drinks are cold, service is quick, acoustics are good for the bands.  I'd recommend.

Cox sucks. A year ago when I moved into my new place I tried to get internet only. They gave me such a hard time, then I ended up with an Internet and tv package that I didn't really want. Fast forward a year later and my usual bill is twice what it was. Turns out they jacked up the prices, no surprise.   So I call and cancel the tv service that I never wanted in the first place. Now I have to wait in line at this store just to drop off the receiver. But no, you can't just drop off the receiver, you have to wait for receipt from an agent. And that's where I've been for the past 20 minutes, with 10+ people ahead of me.

This might be a bit of a rant, but one very important part of this experience soured what would almost certainly have been a 5 star review and that's the bar.  When we arrived for our reservation our table wasn't quite ready, the hostess said it wouldn't be long, and we could wait in the bar and she would come and get us when the table was ready - cool.  When exactly did a bartender become a mixologist? It's not even a real word. Auto-correct wants to change it to seismologist or sexologist (what?). I'll tell you when; it's when the focus changed from making quality drinks quickly and efficiently for thirsty customers, to 10 minute "preparations" that include twisting basil and extracting elderflower. It's when the creation of the drink is more enjoyable for the bartender than the consumption by the patron.  This bartender takes his "art" way too seriously. The only thing that takes longer than getting a couple of drinks made here is how long it must have taken him to coiffure his beard and wax his moustache this morning.   When we arrived in the bar, the solo bartender was muddling mint or basil or nettles or something, staring into space, imagining his next trip to Goodwill or what colour his next pair of Keds would be. No eye contact, no welcome, nada. He seemed oblivious to his surroundings, lost in his craft. By the time he honoured us with his presence, the hostess was back, ready to take us to our table. It had been 20 minutes and we didn't have a drink.  The rest of the evening though was fantastic! Amanda was our server and she was great. Engaging and knowledgeable, funny and entertaining. She started off asking us if we would like a cocktail, with the caveat that it might take some time - yeah, we know.   Based on Amanda's recommendations we ordered courses and started with albacore and yellowtail crudo - amazing. So fresh and delicious. The burrata mozza was out of this world, the fresh mozzarella also very good. Squid Ink risotto was unique and worth a try. The semolina gnocchi was lighter than its doughy or potato brethren.The short rib was so tender it could have been eaten with a spoon - add the bone marrow to really move it to the next level.  We had dessert, but by then I was in too much of food coma to even remember what it was. Chocolate something, maybe?  All in all a very good experience. Would I go back? Absolutely. Would I skip the bar and go straight to my table next time? You betcha.

After 3 visits, it's time for a review. But first, I just have to address some of the other, more negative reviews -   1. "The chalkboard is confusing" - No it's not. Find a beer you like the sound of, or the style, tell the server the number. Easy 2. "The colours of the chalk hurt my eyes" - really? get some glasses. 3. "It closes too early" - come earlier 4. "It's too busy" - come later 5. "I don't like craft beer" - don't come at all 6. "I have to share my table, eeew" - unless you are paying their bill, what's yer problem? make some new friends. 7. "It's too loud" - It's a bar, it's supposed to be loud 8. "the parking lot is too small" - be thankful that there is a (free) parking lot. There is always street parking or you could ride a bike. 9. "there's not enough bike parking" - chain it to a lamppost. 10. "The beers keep running out" - it is a rotating selection, they are not running out, they are changing. 11 & 12 "The beers are too expensive" - "Where is the Coors/Bud/Miller?" - I give up.  The fact that this bar is so unique is probably why so many people are confused and write dumbass reviews. It takes them out of their comfort zone. It is for this very reason that I am giving it 5 stars. Most places are exactly the same as everywhere else and kudos to Angel's Trumpet for daring to be different.  I love the beer selection, I love that I haven't heard of most of them. I also love the food. The onion and blue cheese quesadilla was amazing. The bison BLT in a blanket was a knockout and the avocado salad made my vegetarian girlfriend very happy. The service has been good all 3 visits.  What really blew my mind during the last visit was the quality of the music. When a bar plays The Jam, Madness, The Specials, The Clash, Talking Heads, Depeche Mode, The Police, The Beat, I know there is someone in charge (even if only in charge of the music) with good taste.  One suggestion - the chalkboard on the patio should be raised. It's too low when people sit at the table right next to it and difficult to read. Other than that one, very minor inconvenience, this place is unique and it rocks. I will be back for sure.

I really enjoyed my dinner here. The menu is different enough to be unique, but not completely out there that you don't recognize a word.  First impressions count and the friendly valet started our evening off well. We were seated promptly at a white-linen table. Angela was our server and she was both engaging and extremely knowledgeable about the menu. My girlfriend is a pregnant vegetarian and Angela was very accommodating with her, making suggestions and recommendations and not fazed at all when we asked to modify a menu item based on her menu restrictions.  The wine list is just big enough and veers away from boring middle of the road selections. I had a GSM which was great. There is a full bar and a gin martini arrived at the table smoking from dry ice. Nice touch.  I had the Sand Dabs (my first time) and they were amazing. Flat fish, similar to Sole and the brown butter and almonds really complemented the dish. My girlfriend had the paella as did one of our other companions, but with the addition of chicken as recommended by Angela. Our fourth had the duck, perfectly cooked to medium rare. He was impressed.  The menu items are a la carte, meaning that all you get is the protein. This can be a little misleading as reading the descriptions might lead you to think that sides come with the entrées, but Angela was quick to explain that it was a garnish rather than a side. The "Local Produce" (Sides) page was full of imaginative local, seasonal vegetables prepared quite eclectically. We ordered the Beets (comes with hazelnuts, feta and a huckleberry vinaigrette) the Fried Red Potatoes which were tossed in herbs and garlic and served aside a Brava sauce with a poached egg on top. Broccoli with a Cheddar sauce which packed some heat and on Angela's recommendation, the Kale which was out of this world. I can tell you I'm not a big vegetable fan and kale usually isn't on my grocery list, but this was great. I couldn't get enough.  Desserts are also well thought out and uniquely presented. We split a Chocolate Puddin' Cake, which was served in a mason jar with melted marshmallow on the top; the Sweet Potato Cheesecake, which sounds disgusting, but is absolutely the opposite and a sorbet pushpop, yep, just like you remember from your youth - only better.  There were other great items on the menu, such as bone marrow, sweetbreads, octopus and pork belly, so I know I will be coming back!

I had eaten Pomo's pizza a bunch of times in the past, but for one reason or another, someone else had always gone to pick it up. So it wasn't until this time that I actually ventured inside.  The food itself warrants 5-stars. It is authentic and delicious. There will be endless debates the world over about what is the best pizza, what is the best style, what is the best crust. We all have our own opinions, but for me Neapolitan wins every time. The crisp, slightly chewy crust is amazing. The toppings are always fresh and plentiful. Now, it's not the cheapest pizza you will ever get, but, trust me, it is worth every penny. I'm sure it's not cheap to build an oven made from bricks and volcanic sand from Southern Italy.  Everyone here is so nice! From the greeters to the servers to the bartender. Even the cooks look happy in their work. My order wasn't quite ready when I arrived, but the greeter was quick, efficient and welcoming. When I sat at the bar and had a Peroni while waiting, the bartender was engaging and friendly.  I heard they have opened another two locations, so wherever you live, you are probably close to a Pomo Pizzeria. Do yourself a favor and go visit!

Super friendly staff at this former chain location. No unnecessary upsells here, just good, honest, reasonably priced car service. Expect a bit of a wait on the weekends, but that's only to be expected everywhere on the weekends. You can also call ahead if you need to.

Just had drinks here, so can't comment on the food. It was happy hour, so I ordered a gin gibson. It tasted weird, but i didn't say anything because I thought it might have been the brand of gin that they used (Aviator?)  When I got the bill I realized that he had misheard "gin" for "Chopin" and I got an expensive non-happy hour vodka gibson. They also charged $4.50 for a club soda - there was nothing happy about that. It is Vegas, though, so suck it up.  Service was excellent, other than the bartender being a bit deaf.

I love the fact that The Gladly's patio is dog-friendly! We were looking for a place to go after taking our German Shepherd puppy and 10-month-old child for a hike, for some drinks and maybe some apps. We enjoyed it so much we stayed for dinner!  This upscale, but not pretentious restaurant offers a great selection of appetizers and entrées and a very aggressively-priced happy hour menu (bottles of wine for $20!). The drinks list had a lot of unique cocktails, more whiskies than I've seen anywhere in a long time and a decent wine and beer selection.  Kat was our server and she was fantastic! She was engaging and friendly. She was a wealth of knowledge with the menu and we ordered based on her recommendations. Even if the food sucked (which it didn't!) I would go back for Kat's service! She even brought over a bowl of water for the dog.  We ordered the Brussels Sprouts with grits, the cheese and sausage pretzel and the mozzarella fondue. Everything was delicious! For entrées we had the scallops and the famous chopped salad with salmon. The scallops were delicious! So tender and sweet. I would go so far as to say that the cola gastrique was probably unnecessary as the combination of scallops, belly bacon and sweet pea tendrils was a perfect on their own. The salad has its own Facebook page for a reason!  10/10

The concept is very simple, but it has been executed flawlessly. The British Cornish Pasty is the Spanish empanada, the Jamaican patty, the Indian samosa. It is essentially meat and veg wrapped in pastry then baked. Done right it can be delicious!  I'm English. I grew up eating pasties. Although being from the north-west of England the pasties I ate weren't Cornish, they were a variation of the Irish pasty. Same concept, but lighter pastry, flakey, almost puff pastry. I always thought the crust of a true Cornish pasty was too tough, almost cardboard-esque, (some say they were made this way to prevent damage if they were dropped down a mine). But this is not the case for the pasties from Cornish Pasty Co. Here they are done well.  At Cornish Pasty Co they are light and tasty and the fillings were great. And oh, the choices! From the traditional Oggie to lamb or chicken or pork or cheese steak. There's even a tongue-in-cheek pasty which pays homage to Pulp Fiction. If you're a vegetarian, there aren't just a couple of choices, there is a whole page for you!  The beer list was extensive and varied, the patio wrapped around the whole building and the service was quick, attentive and engaging.

The restaurant is clean and bright and each time I have been the staff have been more than welcoming. They engage in conversation with you and genuinely seem happy that you came.  I've been three times now, and had different items each time. Everything is great! The fish tacos, the shrimp burrito, the steak tacos, the breakfast tacos, everything! The tortillas had a great texture and flavour. Loved the cartinas!  You should go check it out!

Blink and you might miss ThirdSpace. A cool (beer-wine only) bar on the corner of Grand Ave and 11th Avenue, I've driven past it every day but hadn't stopped in until this past weekend.  A warm welcome awaits from the friendly bartender through a window that serves the outside patio. The weather was co-operating so we sat outside in the early evening and enjoyed the surroundings. The outside area, surrounded by quaint little shops and trees give it a New Orleans courtyard kind of feel. Citronella candles had been placed to deter the blood-sucking insects, and that was most appreciated.   The beer selection was impressive, recited filibuster-style by the bartender. They even had $2 PBRs and High Life to cater to the Hipsters. Didn't have an opportunity to try the food, but it gets good reviews here, so I'll come back for that soon.  As we were leaving a band was setting up for the evening, kinda looked like Wilson Phillips, but I didn't "Hold On" to hear them....

Interesting concept with independent food vendors surrounding a central bar area. It wouldn't be fair to review the food stalls here as I'm sure I can find them separately on Yelp and review them one-by-one.  The first time I came I was with a crew from work. We weren't sure exactly how the payment worked, so we asked the bartender. We asked if we could order from all the different food places, have some drinks and receive just one check? Absolutely! he said. No problem. Just go and order and pay him. Sounded great, except that's a lie. All of the food stalls are independent of each other and you have to pay at the Asian place, then at the burger place, then at the oyster place and then at the bar for the drinks. I don't know if he was new and didn't know, stoned and didn't care, or if he was just fucking with us. Either way, not cool.  Second visit was a bit better as I knew the rules, but nobody is really friendly.  Oh,and what's with the parking? You've got this big lot, but it's closed off. There is another lot close by, but that was full. Luckily I was able to snag a spot on the street. But why have a parking lot if you're not going to open it for the paying customers??

Great new breakfast+lunch addition to the neighbourhood. I love the variety of the menu and the prices are super affordable. My wife has brought me back take-out from there a couple of times and all the breakfast and lunch items have been consistently good.  I visited for the first time this past weekend and the place was hopping! There are pre-made croissant sandwiches in the cabinet for only $3.50 and the beet salad served in a jar is well worth a try.   A couple of opportunities -   1. Checkout girl was not the friendliest. Seemed like she might have been having a bad day and was trying her best to make sure everyone knew it.  2. No wifi. There is even a sign that says "no wifi - talk to each other". I think that's a bit condescending to be honest. What if I came there on my own? You probably don't want me talking to myself in your restaurant, may not send the right message! I get that you probably don't want the Starbucks-Hipsters camping out at your tables for hours sipping on a bottomless cup of coffee, but other people might really appreciate the wifi. For example, my wife holds a breakfast meeting every Wednesday and brought her team here last week, but needed wifi to be productive, so they will go back to their other place now.  As it is only a short walk away from my house I'm sure we will be back many times to work our way through the menu.

This place is cool. Retro cool, dude.   It's a bar filled with arcade games from the 80's and 90's. I was very excited to relive my youth when I saw the Galaga machine and promptly got the high score! I was very proud of myself for a moment until the next guy tripled it!  It was freeplay night while I was there, so that was good.  No food. Good drinks.
