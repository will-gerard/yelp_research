I eat here too much i think!  I have this place down, as far as how to get things just ordered right and when to go.  ribs are great, and i always eat too much.  Went there last night (try to do my share of boosting the economy) and went with just 1/3 rack of ribs, because i knew i would have to finish my wife's and my two kids food too.  still too much and i had some weird dreams that night with my full belly.  love it!

I don't eat at chili's too often, but i should because i have never had a bad experience there, but i don't like chains and franchises.  any way stopped there for lunch and had their pick 3 dinner dipper thing and it was great and not too much food, 2 mini burgers (excellent) chicken wings (excellent) and artichoke egg roll thingies (great too).  almost finished it all and very good, great service and pleasant.  anything i can do to stimulate the economy.

Great place to eat.  love their chile fries.  i get tired of the large franchise chains and it is nice to eat at local establishment.  if you are ever passing by lindsey and broadway stop in and try it out you wont be dissappointed.

The layout is great for the game.  I have been here a couple of times and have a blast.  The games are plenty long and give you plenty of time to have fun.  Despite the commando units that live there and play the game in groups 24/7, you can still have fun playing your own game.  The staff is great and they seem to have fun working there.  The only down side is that i fear for my life walking in and out of the place, never knowing what type of people are lurking around.  The place seems to attract some very interesting characters, which i am sure are harmless but scary nonetheless.

I admit that I dabble in the art of some asian cooking.  I spent some time over there and have learned of few neat dishes that are very good.  Lee Lee is the only place so far that i can find my favorite soy sauce.  go there and pick up som Silver Swan soy sauce and you will never go back to anything else.  in fact you will be disgusted with that kikoman crap that they serve in every resturant and wish you had this every time you went out to each.  They also have everything else you could imagine from the orient.  its worth the drive and the experience.  who needs a passport and a $1000 plain ticket to experience asia.  just head to Lee Lee's

i have been there for trees, lawn seed, flowers, and all my garden stuff.  everything is nice.  my garden this year was a real success and i got everything from them.  my lawn is doing great and the seed i got from them was perfect, no weeds came up.  the staff is pretty helpful too.  they don't hassle you but they know their stuff if you have a question.  they get pretty busy sometimes.

This place reminds me of that Weird Al movie UHF and the store Spatchula City, with the whole store full of spatchulas.  Anyway, you need something with lighting they got it.  Fans, lamps, shades, accessories, bulbs, etc.  if you have that odd bulb that you can't find a replacement for, go to them.

Great service here! A lot cleaner than your usual mexican rest. Big bar area and large dinning area as well.  Great location, away from all normal trendy stuff. Get there and enjoy.

great place.  we take all of our personal and business vehicles to these guys and they take good care of us.  Ask for Jeff when you go in, that guy knows what customer service is and how to make raving fans.

very trendy mexican resturant that has horrible service from old ladies who can't hear or move fast enough to keep your drinks filled.  and the place smells very bad.  i suggest a little remodeling along with some spring cleaning.

this is a pretty cool place.  they have a huge selection at great prices.  i have been in there to buy pieces of carpet, rugs, foam pads for camping and other items.  they also bind carpet edges for floor rugs which is much cheaper than buying an actual rug.

Most people just run to Home Depot when they are getting ready to do home improvements because they cater to the DIYers and don't force you to buy wholesale amounts.  Don't be afraid of the large building suppliers they all have a customer store front that you can go into and pick what you want.  My neighbor got new bedroom doors in his house and they were a lot less than HD.  I told him i needed new doors and baseboards and i wanted to put up some crown molding as well, he told me to try R&K and they are awesome.  they have a door showroom for exterior and interior doors, and all the different kinds of trim you can think of.  Steve, or Dustin will treat you good and find what you are looking for.  It is so nice not to have those hideous brown wood grain doors on my bedrooms, instead i have nice paneled doors with beautiful hardware to make my home look newer.  I don't know if crown molding is still in, but i love the fact that i don't have to do such a good job with my painting of the walls with the ceiling, just cover it with the molding.  that's it.

been here once and had a blast. if your looking for an activity that requires more effort than the movie theater than try this place out.  the price is fair with the amount of climbing available and they have all different kinds of levels. me being a beginner, i still climbed until i was completley tired and didn't get to everything.  took my six year old too and she had a blast. won't say who did better, but i think i am getting old or something.  if i had the energy and the skills i would get a membership immediatley and go all the time.  fun to try.

The food is great! no doubt!  The resturant is pretty cool too.  My kids actually enjoy the place, and eat the food and they always get to pick their favorite candy when they are done from all the old fashion candies.  Every once and awhile their line gets backed up pretty far, but i guess most resturants have that problem on a Saturdays.  The problem could be fixed with a little rearranging of a few things but it isn't that big of a deal.  We will go back many times in the future.

My kids love this place.  and for a kid to love getting their hair cut that says something.  everytime we drive by they can recognize it and they always tell me that is where they get their hair cut, and then retell the story.  Lollilocks has made raving fans out of my kids and me.

I agree with Brandon L.  Costa vida, chipotle, and any other for that matter beats cafe rio hands down.  I have tried and tried to listen to my utah friends who rave about this place and have been there at least 3 times and have now decided that i will not go back anymore.  i think people are blinded by the hype of what people say and if you actually taste the food you know that it isn't good.  plus i hate ad ons.  enchilada style $1, sourcream $2, guacomole $2.  i am surprised they don't charge me for the beans, rice and tortilla.  i am already paying $8 bucks for the buritto, why do i have to pay for everything else that goes with it.  truth is it is a utah thing.  if your not from utah you won't like it. just like those not from from australia cant handle veggiemite.

Don't freak out and call me insane or cruel, but i don't have health insurance anymore, (long story) and yes i have kids.  anyway, my daughter got sick and we just wanted to get her checked out and called a few places and told them we were cash paying and need to see a doctor, with out having to go to an urgent care and wait hours.  canyon is great they get your kids in quick and they are $60 for a visit.  I still don't think doctors have a clue what they are doing, but they put my wife at ease and we were on our way.  and i don't have a $800 month premium to pay either.  just one way i am sticking it to the man, don't fall for the scare tatics.

I don't know why i have been here more than once, but the parking is horrible, and the food is only so-so.  lots of color and flare but not much going for it.  the baja sauce is great but i seem to get sick later that evening when i eat it.  i need to learn from experience

one of my favorites.  food is good, atmosphere is good.  one of the few places that tries and succeeds in bringing the islands home to arizona.

new place.  2 doctors and one assistant.  staff is nice and very clean inside.  good service.  some of my kids have had last minute needs and they have been able to get them in and take care of them.  beats hanging out in an ER for hours.

Food not good, water was taken from the toilet i think, and service was only so so.  Just another fancy name, with fancy atmosphere, but they forgot to serve food that is edible.  And though you can order a variety of drinks, sometimes washing food down with a glass of water is nice. any restaurant that can't invest in a simple RO system for drinking water or to make their drinks with, shouldn't be charging $12 for an appetizer.  Small price to pay for a comfort that goes a long way.

Met a tempe marketplace for a quick meeting and decided to do lunch.  walked around to find a good place to eat and the selling factor was the guy standing outside the door with free samples.  one bite and we were in.  great sandwich and easy to order and quick to deliver.  and the pigeons haven't discovered this section of resturants yet (if you have been to tempe market place you know what i mean).  we ate outside and i must say i love this time of year. great sandwich too, did i mention that.  don't be swayed by the phoney irish pub next door with the girls in the short kilts, we almost fell for it but went with the fat greasy guy handing out samples of their delicious sandwiches. maybe will have the kilts next time!

Not sure why i am giving them a review.  looks like they have plenty of support.  i have had the cajun, and steak and cheese pasty.  both were excellent.  little crowded sometimes.  patience is need here.  it take time to make each pasty, they aren't premade and frozen, so expect to be there a minimum for an hour for luch.  the servers are very nice and polite.  nice to eat something different for a change.  but i will be going back more i am sure.

I was a little hesitant on writing a review on this place after reading the reviews of others.  I guess all i can say is i got lucky it seems.  We were on our way to On The Border when we noticed it had closed down. So i saw this place that i hadn't heard of and said lets give it a try.  I prefer trying new places anyway.   I walked in and told the lady that me and another family, that were on their way, were looking for a place to eat and wanted to know why i should eat here (just giving her a hard time), i asked if the service was good, the place was clean, and if the food was good and what mexico city cuisine meant.  i think i caught her off guard because she didn't know how to answer except smile and laugh.  with my group of 12 they went right to work and put tables together, and i think they knew that i was expecting a lot.  i also saw the manager getting things together for us too.  my the time the rest of our group showed up they seated us with the table full of chips and their trio salsa, which everyone enjoyed.  The food was very good, my wife and i split the fajitas, and normally you get a huge plate full of onions and peppers with a few strips of meat, but it was just the opposite here, we got  a plate full of steak and chicken and just the right amount of onions and peppers.  very tasty and all went well.  drinks were delivered well and they even brought me out an extra pitcher of Dr. Pepper just for me to make sure i didn't run out.   I guess i have to go back to see if they could deliver quality consistently.

I guess I get the 1 star for myself, for never coming back to give an update.  It has been several years since my first visit, but I have been back several times, and every time is a great experience.  Service is excellent, and you cant beat that trio salsa. Haven't been disappointed once. This is our go to mexican restaurant when we can't decide.
