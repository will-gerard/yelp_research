Ron & Ronnie are stand-up guys.  This small, family-run business is quite simply the only place I would bring my vehicles.  I trust their opinions, prices, and work without any reservations.  I've been coming to this shop for over 5 years!  Sometimes they are busy, sometimes they aren't, but either way, they care about the quality and reputation of the work they do.  If you are looking for straight answers, fair prices, responsible workmanship, and respect for your vehicle, this is the shop you want to go to.

I've been to other OPH's, but this one is my favorite.  Ron (the owner?) is an awfully nice fella, and when he stops in to chat with you, you get that warm fuzzy, small-town vibe.  As others have pointed out, on the weekends, the wait is super long -- which should tell you something, but if you are just a party of 2, you can skip the line and hit the small counter bar -- it's first come first serve.  As for the food, with a name like "original pancake house", the pancakes are about what you'd expect -- nothing short of perfect.  But don't underestimate other menu choices -- my mother, a chef, said they made the best omelette of her life.  Seriously.  At *this* place.  And the coup de gr√¢ce? Order the bacon cheddar grits on the side to share.  The best grits you'll ever eat.  My only gripe, sometimes, is the wait staff is a little shaky.  I recognize they are super busy, and this is a hole in the wall, but sometimes, I don't feel the love ...  sometimes.

Without a doubt, good stuff!  The ambiance is just about universally appealing: dim, lush, old school class, and fun in a back-to-the-future-but-not-campy kinda way.  I sat at the bar, so I can't comment on the table service, but the sheer number of staff walking around leads me to believe it'd be on-point.  I was in the mood for steak and steak is what I got:  perfectly cooked to temperature, classically seasoned, and most importantly, well rested.  The only word of caution here is that if you intend to dine here, not take home leftovers, and finish your meal, the portions served could be devastating to any plans afterwards.  I ordered the 18oz ribeye, and it had minimal gristle:  add in the salad, a side, whatever you're drinking, and you are potentially facing a full 2 pounds of food in your stomach.  That's borderline competitive eating, and it might make you reach for the couch in a desperate attempt to take a nap.  Next time, I'll definitely be getting a surf & turf so I can have room to try the seafood since there seems to be a lot of great stuff to try here besides choking down a steak of flinstonian proportions.  All in all, very satisfied ... even as I write this review from my couch.

Easily my favorite place to sling back some late night cocktails in the entire Phoenix-Mesa-Glendale Metropolitan Statistical Area.  I like the staff, and they seem to tolerate me at just about all Defcon levels of toxicity and still welcome me the next time without grudges -- yet.  While I don't usually get very adventurous with my drink, I have to say, they make an excellent Old Fashioned -- and I seem to remember enjoying a really good Hot Tottie during the holidays.  If frozen margaritas are what you are looking for, don't even bother showing up -- I don't think they have a blender.  It's never empty, usually filled with interesting looking and sounding people, and thankfully, they usually pick out good tunes on the jukebox for me.

I'm not a "Chinese Food" enthusiast by any stretch.  I would almost always prefer any other asian cuisine over Chinese.  That said, I AM a potsticker fan.  And let me tell you, a good potsticker is hard to find around here.  Autumn Court has the best potstickers in the city -- by far.  So far, in fact, it's hard to believe no one has said anything about it.  I go here specifically for them.  They are not to be missed.  Other than that, I've had the fried rice, which is excellent as well (for fried rice).  My eating companion always orders the sushi, and claims it's great.  I've also tried some random dishes here and there, all about what you'd expect -- neither mind-blowing nor inedible.  I personally like the service here.  The owners and servers are humble, and helpful and, you know, nice enough.  The ambiance is above-par for a place like this in this price range.  And here is a tip for all the parents squawking about the lack of a children's menu:  order paper-wrapped chicken appetizer and a side of rice.  It's the closest thing to a kid's teriyaki chicken.  Works for me.  But seriously.  Try the potstickers.

So I just came back from Tarbell's.  Underwhelmed and slightly offended would be the summary for my experience there.  The positives, straight-away:  the ambiance, decor and the bartender serving me were all perfectly adequate -- and that's where they end.  So I'll be the first to admit, I'm a male 30-something showing up alone on the Saturday before Mother's day, without a reservation and wearing a tshirt and jeans (nice ones though).  Even if you consider gender and age profiling aside, there is absolutely no excuse for how I was treated when I walked through the door.  I walk in, and the hostess just gives me a blank stare.  I say "Hi".  She continues to just stare at me like I'm a two headed alien.  I actually had to initiate spoken language by glibly asking "This is a restaurant, right?" -- clearly I'm trying to get noticed -- there isn't a crowd around me.  "Yes this is a restaurant ..." followed by more staring and silence.  I say "well, I'm pretty hungry, can we do something about that" -- and only then does she bother to explain that the dining room is full but I could find myself a seat at the bar.  Gee thanks.  It was so unbelievably disrespectful and unwelcoming I'm pretty sure the only reason I actually sat down at the bar was because there was a seat open, and I was still trying to process what had just happened.  Trying to put that behind me, the lady barkeep takes my drink order, and my food order:  carpaccio ($17) and the NY steak ($44).  The carpaccio was the most boring carpaccio I have ever had -- not bad, not good: boring.  Insanely, there was too much meat!  Just all meat and parmigiano -- a little more olive oil and some simple dressed greens would have made that dish so much better.  The steak I ordered medium-rare.  It came out medium, it was kinda charred, and really tough for "35 day aged" hand-picked angus prime -- more like the consistency of medium London broil from Safeway.  It had a sauce on it (which wasn't mentioned on the menu) that just looked and tasted like the most basic demi-glace sauce you could imagine -- at first I thought it was the steak bleeding off.  I don't eat potatoes, so I just asked for extra spinach.  Pan creamed?  Pfft -- I swear it was simply a pile of salted, wilted spinach -- it had no seasoning I could detect, much less any kind of cream or butter or anything.  It was so plain it was sticking to my teeth.  I skipped dessert.  Final thoughts:  after some consideration, I still gave this place 2 stars.  If you're an older, much more boring person in the world, this place is right up your alley.  With all the Bentleys and Porsches parked out front (I saw some fogey driving a Viper!) this place would probably be perfect for older rich people that have no real palate:  people that go to restaurants to improve their socioeconomic standing among their peers instead of discovering mind-blowing food.  I'm sure Chef Tarbell is an excellent chef, but I'm under the impression he has had to dumb down his food because the well-heeled, stodgy clientele wouldn't be able to appreciate the real thing.  That, or Food Network's ICA is scripted and staged.

I've been to a Chinese buffet or two in my day -- and this one just doesn't stack up.  5 plates of food, and somehow I'm still left wanting ...  The pizza should be the first giveaway that they don't mean business.  Where are potstickers? Where's the calamari salad? That was definitely NOT sushi.  While I can certainly appreciate the food I did over-consume was good-tasting, as fresh as can be for an establishment like this, and visually appealing, frankly, there just wasn't much of selection.  Or I should say, the selection just wasn't what I'm used to.  Maybe I've been spoiled by the Bay Area; maybe I've been spoiled by southeast Tempe; maybe this place just isn't very good.  Bottom line:  if a gutful of Asian food is the plan, China Olive certainly gets the job done -- just don't expect a lot of differentiation in what you shove down your gulet.

I found this salon right here on Yelp, and I have been coming back for over 2 years.  As a creature of habit, I've only had Adele do my hair, and she is really great, so I can't comment on anyone else who works there, other than to say they seem pleasant (and fun) enough.  I think I can say with certainty that Adele has been the most skilled stylist my hair has had the good fortune to be in company with, and that my hair has come out better here, more consistently, than anywhere else.  She also puts up with my last minute cancellations, hangovers, and irritating scheduling practices -- thanks Adele!  So, without a doubt, this is the place I go to, and will continue to do so unless something really bad happens or something.  Some things to note:  I used to go to a fancy Aveda salon on Mill Ave, and the price there was $5 more than what I pay Adele.  At the Aveda salon, they used to do the whole massage your hands thing and put a hot towel on my face and whatnot.  I think people like that kind of stuff -- just not this guy.  I used to have to go to the lobby bathroom and give myself a scrubdown so I wouldn't smell like cucumbers or mint or whatever that oily stuff they slathered on me was.  So that's just me and I'm just glad that Adele gives me the extra (cold by request!) rinse-down before I leave so I'm not a walking ball of shedding hair particles -- and that's how I like it.  But if you are looking for a super fancy place that focuses more effort on your hands than your hair, you might be less than happy here.    You will, however, probably get better service, from nicer and more talented people.  I'm not much of a chit-chatter when I get my hair did -- but I'm happy to listen to the banter that goes on around me, and the other patrons seem to have genuine experiences.  Two other minor issues (and the reason for the loss of the star):  1 - The whole look of the building and the rear parking lot doesn't make for a very salon-ish feel.  The parking lot back there seems like anarchy -- cars parked every which way.  I realize the building is an older slump-block conversion on the borders of Arcadia, but the first time I saw the place (and I'm not sure why, exactly), it looked more like some kind of restaurant.  Your architectural influence could use some updating.  2 - Again, this has more to do with ambiance more than anything (and probably more for people besides myself) but the waiting area isn't very comfortable either.  I know you guys have limited space to work with, but there it is.

preface: i was hungry on memorial day, and i didn't have any food at home, and i had no intention of going food shopping or any intention of leaving the house in general.  so, grubhub it was to see who was going to be the lucky winner to deliver food to me -- and to my surprise, it was either this place or pizza, and i don't do pizza.  everything else was closed.  shockingly, the minimum via grubhub was $25, which with tip, tax, etc, really came out to $35 -- but whatever -- it's the cost of being lazy.  so, obviously, i over-ordered, which i guess was a good thing because i got a solid sampling of food.  here's what i got:  mutton hominy stew:  on first attempt, this was one extremely boring meal.  i'm not one for salty or over-spiced foods, but i had to dose this puppy with salt *and* butter to get it to taste like something other than wet meat and corn.  once the salt and butter were supplemented, it was rather good.  navajo lamb sandwich:  again, a little on the plain side.  no sauce, no mayo, no juice -- chopped vegetables, unseasoned grilled lamb and unseasoned grilled peppers.  i liked the flavor of the grilled peppers, and the lamb was just ok.  the whole thing was "meh" -- needed some pizazz, but certainly large and in charge.  fry bread with honey:  obviously, very good.  when your restaurant is named "sacred hogan navajo frybread" it had better be.  overall:  come for the frybread if that's what you got a hankering for.  otherwise unless you like food that tastes like the raw ingredients food is cooked with, simply combined, pass on actually using this establishment as a "restaurant".

what is this filth that i am eating?  had it delivered ... but whoops!  forgot the rice.  how do you forget the rice?  anyhow, the peanut sauce was deplorable ... it was literally the consistency of water, i could pour it down the drain - and did.  the panang curry was the same -- more like soup and less like sauce.  this place is easily in the bottom 3 of thai places i have ever eaten at.

this concept is unbeatable. $25 bucks a month for virtually unlimited (it's actually once a day max) carwashes. if you like having your car visually clean all the time, this is your place.

I really love this place.  I like this place so much, I'm bummed I don't get to go more often.  All the times I have eaten there, I have never been unhappy with the food, service, or drinks.  The food is always full of flavor -- that calamari salad is unreal.  The short-ribs compete for the best-of in Phoenix.  Sadly, they don't have the duck breast entree anymore -- that was one of my favorite meals in Phoenix period.  The specialty drinks are excellent as well -- I really like the fact that they aren't over-sweet like so many these days -- they strike a great balance of ingredients that elevate the liquor instead of making it something it's not.  Finally the service is spot-on:  friendly, casual, and on-point.  The staff makes every effort to remember familiar faces, and they always seem to go the extra mile to make sure everything is dialed in for the time you spend there.  Solid!  If I *had* to critique something, the only thing that comes to mind is the furniture on the patio -- I just never feel comfortable sitting out there.

Like many others have echoed -- this place is seriously suffering from an identity crisis.  But truthfully, lots of Phoenix establishments do -- this one is just particularly shameless about it.  Who is this place for?  Certainly not families with kids -- my son and I waited for an hour just to *not* get in on any games.  Locals, foodies, older crowds, hipsters, college students?  None of the above.  The sheer volume of patrons must drive the locals nuts, with cars tucked away in every corner of the neighborhood and people wandering through the streets like zombie lemmings.  Foodies are gonna be seriously let down by the food, which is a notch above Chili's.  Older folks out looking for a vibrant meal sure will get that with all the pushy patrons and their kids running around.  I think hipsters and college students are immediately disqualified because of the prohibitive cost and patience/persistence required to get in on any of the games.  This place is seriously expensive -- borderline outrageous -- for what you get in the ambiance you get it in.  I have absolutely no problem paying $50 for the perfect bone-in fillet -- but paying $22 for a some kind of cooked-to-death sliced meat over gorgonzola cheese with a side of fries (fries!) is robbery and a violation.  So, I guess the perfect demographic would be young and obscenely rich parents that don't have to do any parenting -- those that use social cues instead of taste buds to decide if what they are eating is any good.  The nanny gets to hover over the children and wait for games to open up, while the parents get tipsy on $15 sugar water.  Good thing the valet is free -- they'll pull their Expeditions right up for them.  So it's either those people or maybe college kids with trust funds and nothing better to do?  Pass.
