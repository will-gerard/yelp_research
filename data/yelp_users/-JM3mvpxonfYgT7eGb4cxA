Love this place!!   I've bought 2 vehicles through the place over the years.  It's a family run and operated biz... very fair and very honest!

Not a Danny's car anymore, with Danny's if your a member & they have your plate # in the system.... A basic wash is $6.95!  @ this place $12. 95.... They must use better water.... NOT!  Never again!
