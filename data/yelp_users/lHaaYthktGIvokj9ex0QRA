Location is great. Most of the stars go to that.  Beer is good/okay. Food is kinda edible. Service is some of the worst I've encountered.   I had the turkey club and my bacon was chewy. My husband had a burrito, which tasted like a big taco bell nacho grande wrapped up in a tortilla. Waitress was lousy. We were ignored and then she took my husband's drink order and didn't ask what I wanted. I don't think she was being rude, but rather had the attention span of a gnat.

After calling out a few different companies to give us a quote, we were sold when Chris came out from AZ Luxury Lawns and Greens. To be honest, the other guys were a tad less expensive, but the QUALITY of turf that Chris brought out was light years beyond the smaller companies' turf. I trusted Chris would do it right, and it was worth spending a little more money to have a better product and know that it was done correctly. Now that it is in, I am extremely satisfied with the workmanship, customer service, feel of the lawn (It looks and feels amazing - my dog LOVES it), and I will absolutely, enthusiastically recommend AZ Luxury Lawns and Greens to my friends and family.

The food was good and service was great. Nice atmosphere. We came in for brunch, and I ordered the steak and eggs, which was steak and eggs - very good. My husband ordered the street tacos, which had a lot of flavor and were plenty filling. I want to give this place 5 stars, and I think if the food had a touch more... Something... I would be giving it 5/5. I will come back to see if I get that something next time.

This is the best Einsteins I've been to!! It's clean, the staff are friendly, and it has a GREAT outdoor seating area. Paul, the owner, is friendly and goes out of his way to make sure we're happy. He remembers us when we come in - it's a big company run with a small, family business feel. I've made this my breakfast spot because I know that I'll be treated well!!

Jay, the owner of healthy and clean, came to my house to clean my carpet in two rooms. He arrived on time and did great work (my carpet looks brand new). He's honest and friendly. He is someone I won't hesitate to recommend to my friends and family. He also guarantees his work for 30 days, which is nice! Will be calling him soon to do the rest of my house plus my grout.  Again, highly, highly recommend!!

After lots of research and getting quotes from about 5 different paver companies, I went with AE Interlock Design because they had the best bid. I signed the contract and was disappointed to hear that they would not be able to start for a month. They arrived on time and the agreed upon day, and the owner, Asher, came with a crew of 3 men. This was the first time I met Asher,  as the entire time I had been working with his employee, Kim, who was sent to make the bid, sign the contract, and shook my hand.   When Asher arrived he became upset and told us that he could not do our backyard for the amount of money that we signed the contract for. He said it would be at least a 3 day job and that he would lose money. He offered to give us our deposit back plus a hundred fifty dollars. With my patience waining and 3 palettes of bricks on my driveway, I wanted this job done now. He asked for $550 more than what we agreed upon and signed the contract for. He said this was the first time this has happened. In the same breathe, I signed a contract with this man and he broke it. I don't know about you, but a contract is my word. I told him that this practice was ethically shaky, and that when you bid a job and sign a contract with someone, you eat the cost because a signed contract is your word - and reputation.   Overall, he and his crew did a good job. He said that he has not worked a job in 2 years and he stayed to work our backyard because it was technically a difficult job.  It also only took them 1 day + 2.5 hours (not the 3 day job he said this would take and the reason he would lose money on it).  Again, I believe they do good work, but I will not be using or recommending this company again in the future because of their unethical practices.  If I did it again, I would go with John Traynor from Stone Creations.
