Still my favorite Taco Bell. They are always friendly and the one time they forget something they ended up giving us a extra dessert no charge! Ps inside is also clean majority of the time too!

went here with my bf and his friend. came in at 7pm. took 10 minutes for someone to even realize we walked in the door..then took about 35 min to even get our food. they didn't seem very friendly. luckily, the food is pretty good [i've eaten indian food in europe before and it almost stood up to that.] i just didn't care for how slow they were.

i used to eat at this place every month back in 2005-2007, since then they have completely gone down hill. really slow service and the quality has faded, i feel badly i hope they can fix that soon.

Gluten free options! Awesome italian soda/creme drink! Not to mention I found out you can order/eat at the espresso bar and skip that long line on the weekends! Definitely going to be back here again for breakfast! P.s. the owner is very friendly

A dentist who truly cares about taking care of you and doesn't rush an appt. He even calls to check up on you after a procedure, how awesome is that? My whole family goes here and has for the past 3 years.

I'd been to Toni and Guy and been disappointed too many times. They always never listened to my "please don't chop a ton off" speech. So a friend suggested I go to her stylist. Half a year later, I get my hair cut here now and only here. I don't trust anyone else to cut my hair anymore besides Nikki. And color it. I have had at least 20 compliments from complete strangers on how lovely my color looks.

didn't they close already?. we wasted $23 on a all organic gluten free pizza that took them an hour to deliver less than 1/2 mile, and it was tasteless and the size of half a large pizza.

I really enjoyed their chicken tikka masala, lamb saag (maybe spelt that wrong) and a simple made mango lassi here. With the 20% discount here, it is totally worth it! (Believe me, i have had horrible indian food..)

I have never stayed here, but i have dined here for a party and visited Jade Bar for some drinks. My opinions: 1) The views are amazing at sunset! You can see the city at night and it is a beautiful view of Scottsdale 2) The food catered to our party was delicious! Especially the white chocolate truffles at the end of dinner, better than what Godiva makes. 3) If you get a drink at Jade Bar you must try the Strawberry Lavender Royale and the Beet Yuzu Gimlet ( their signature drink.)

Sat at the bar for dinner, twice in our 4 day trip. Never had to bother with a reservation for 2 cause you are allowed wait around until a seat opens up. So basically you wait only 15 min. for 2 seats since most at the bar are waiting for their reservations. The chicken/watercress dish was very good, I chose it for both dinners. The Lolla Rosa salad was really nice and different. Their slingback, bellini and lemon drop were all very good and I was never cheated on the amount of liquor. I actually watched them pour drinks for least 4 hours and I don't know how it is even possible to have one with "barely any liquor" as some have previously stated. Anyway, will be back our next trip!  P.s. Agree with other comments on the hostess stand. The 3 standing up there were kind of blank faced or trying to ignore when I asked them if we could wait around bar while something opened up. They almost seemed to not care to answer. Definitely not polite.

Hands down, best gluten-free pizza in my 6 years of gluten free.

An hour and a half wait...I thought after seeing this on DDD (from the Food Network) that it has to be pretty darn good considering how they raved about it. Was wrong to believe them. It was normal breakfast food that just tasted fresher than what you could eat at Denny's. Not sure why people are obsessed with it. I guess for that long of a wait you expect very yummy food and it was a let down.

Drinks & appetizers, that's my advice. I like their beet salad..but the green beans are raw (or always undercooked?) and they make the salad annoying to chew/eat every time, otherwise that salad is one to try.

Gluten free doughnuts that are still a favorite in my book. I really need to stop by more often- but I been here 4-5 times and always satisfied with my purchase of GF goodies.

Never again. My last minute birthday dinner sucked after horrid service that didn't remember/forgot: to bring any water (but they managed to type two free waters in our bill), my dish came with a side item, to bring my boyfriend ketchup and took over 7 min to get a bill then 7 min to have him take it away. My boyfriend's drink also came in a airplane glass (same size you get for those of you that fly) and it costed $5.50 for well-gin and sprite, really? Plus, while waiting for our dishes, he brought us two of the wrong ones and we had to tell him it wasn't ours. Never had a "sorry" come out of his mouth about anything. Even two of the other bussers asked if we needed anything and we just said "no, just waiting on our bill." I have never wanted to walk out of a restaurant until now.   *This is really sad considering my first experience here was quite nice.

love this place. i worked on a project with their store once in college and thought i probably should check this place out before i work on it..ended up buying about 5 pieces of jewelry. they have the best selection of little dresses for women and my boyfriend even enjoyed the guy section [he is hard to impress.] i highly suggest this place if you like unique accessories and clothing.

1.) They have gluten-free options! You can eat something else besides a salad here, thank God... 2.) Very nice staff and service 3.) Pricey...expect to drop about $50 for two people with alcoholic drinks included..lunch is expensive as well.. 4.) The taste is unique and I enjoy their bbq

Writing this review about 4 months after the night I went, which I will never forget, for a bad reason. I specifically told the waitress I had a gluten-allergy and asked if there was anything here I could eat besides the edamme (which I said if not that is fine i'll just eat the edamme.) The waitress  checked with the chef and came back saying I could get this chicken rice dish and they could do it in gluten-free soy sauce (she also brought out the extra gluten-free soy sauce in the bottle to show me that is what they were using.) So I trusted them in the fact it was the same sauce I use at home...but oh no. About 10 minutes after I ate I felt so sick. Someone must of used the wrong sauce or put the wrong sauce in the bottle by accident cause I was sick the whole entire night. So besides getting very sick..(from whatever mix up...or lie..no one will ever know...) they do have good drinks at happy hour!

Awesome wagyu filet. Mmmmm. Had a delicious specialty drink too. Probably won't ever pay that much again for dinner though, could have bought me a nice pair of shoes.

Well, i'd only come here during happy hour. Good drink menu and a tasty mango martini (wango mango.) I just don't think the sushi is worth the high price when it's not happy hour, sorry my blue friend...

Went here as a group of 4 on a Tuesday night.  Our waitress was awesome and attentive. We had some cheese/meat/olive appetizers that were very tasty! Our steaks though, I felt were not worth $23. I know mine and my bf's both were over done but we gobbled them down anyhow(i am not one to complain like some snob.) They were still bland which was disappointing though. As for drinks, they have the best mojito and champagne mixed drink.  I will probably come here next time just for appetizers and drinks...since the dinners didn't "amaze" me too much.

I have been going to Verrado Grille for over a year now. They recently got a new chef about 2 months ago, he is the real deal! I have a gluten allergy and can't eat out often from cross-contamination in the kitchen so i usually order salads to be safe. Well, the special for that night was a sun-dried tomato roasted chicken with 2 sides. Because i couldn't eat the pre-made herbs, the chef made a new batch of gluten free herbs for my chicken, really nice of them. It  was the best tasting chicken i have had in a long time (and i eat chicken a lot.) Not to mention I didn't get sick from anything! Which really goes to show they actually know what food allergies are. I highly recommend this place for anyone with an allergy like me or just "picky eaters" ;] Plus they have some amazing bartenders who can make a good drink!

Another visit and once again Verrado Grille was nice enough to cater to my gluten-free problem. I got the hummus dip and was able to replace the pita bread with a variety of veggies. I also got the potato skins baked instead of fried so i could eat those too (no cross-contamintion is hard to find still)!  Thanks again to everyone at Verrado Grille for being so accommodating!

I have been here twice. Once for lunch during the weekday (sat at the bar), the other on the weekend at lunch time (sat at a table.) Both times were horrible! The service is horrific...it takes about 10 minutes for them to notice you and the food takes forever as well. Even when i ate there both times, there was barely anyone in the restaurant so i don't see why they were so slow. I am not going back here because of the slow service for mediocre food, although they have great bbq sauce in their store available for purchase (gluten-free), otherwise not worth waiting around.

I do love going here. The service has never been a problem for me on a late Friday or Saturday night. Even on a busy Thursday lunch, we had a great server. But I have gone to Pita Jungle for years and wish they'd add some new gluten free options. I know people say "get a salad" but sometimes we just want a "real meal" besides the hummus, chicken tikka and salad options. So I hope someday they can add some more items to the menu.

I don't know why people are complaining about this place...just go there and eat! I'd rather drop $60 here than a chain restaurant any day.

My boyfriend buys me one at least once a month..sometimes we even get them at the farmer's market in Scottsdale. I have had the: orange, lavender, root beer and salted caramel flavors. Salted caramel or lavender..can't decide which one is better...guess I'll have to keep eating till i figure it out!

This is solely a review just on the bar: Paid $17.50 for a washington apple and a redbull with vodka. 2 drinks, small cups, about 12 icecubes in these cups too making it about a 10 sip drink. Definitely never going back here to drink at the bar...could have bought a whole bottle of vodka for that. No wonder we only saw 2 other couples there haha, should have guessed.

- They off gluten-free breads and can do most items gluten-free here if you ask, even without the "GF" sign on the menu - They are a little pricey...probably because the grass-fed beef, local produce and organic offerings... - I really enjoyed my meal here with a grilled chicken sandwich w/gluten free bread  I'd only go back here during happy hour or on their Monday 1/2 price night because my family said that was "quite expensive for a meal at lunch time" and they'd "rather have leftovers then clean their whole plate." -shrug-

I am now a fan of the cider options on tap with fireball shots in them on a Saturday night. Good way to relax and listen to live music.

Went in with my family and 4 friends last night. I come in here like once a year with a big group. Boyfriend bought himself one cider to drink and a champagne for myself. As we are sitting at table boyfriend spins bottle for fun with our other 3 friends. About two minutes later our waitress says she can't serve him anything else and offers water. Are you kidding me? I should have recorded this as he had no signs of "too much." I was the one who already drank the champagne in the tiny bottle plus added it to my glass prior to the spinning. So with that, forget me bringing groups here again after dinner cause you ruined it.

Likes: -Cheaper drinks than most bars in Phoenix (cough-ihatecopperbluesprices-cough) -Hearing music playing in the venue area -Not being rushed to leave tables and you can hang in here awhile  Dislikes: -1 stall bathroom for women (and men apparently?) I know they probably don't have the room, but it really sucks when someone takes more than 5 min. and you are waiting -Brought in a coupon that apparently was "not approved by them" but on a top coupon site. I got a "well fine.. we will honor it this time, but only on one drink. you can't use that here again, we don't approve those coupons" I felt like a criminal. Just posting a sign about coupons would be a good idea -The way the bar is set up with a crooked line to order a drink, you got to just grab the bartenders attention. I wish the had a system because it makes it difficult when it is busy

Been to every Vig and this is my favorite of them. I like the outdoor bar (probably cause of the previous restaurant Local Breeze and hanging in the same area.) The food is good, I just always feel like it's a bit pricey for what I get for the quality/size. I was sad they didn't have gluten-free buns here though like other Vigs, but maybe cause I was there opening week?  The waitress we had near the inside bar was friendly and willing to check on GF items for me :] always nice when you don't get a "i don't know" and blank stare. And...I love that the bartender knew how to make the perfect AMF! Kudos.

Had an amazing risotto here for dinner! Highly recommend it to anyone who goes here. They also serve omission beer by the bottle here which was a nice change to drink for someone allergic to gluten. As for the coffee side, I enjoy their coffee when it is an iced mocha! Haven't tried other coffee here yet so I will be back again to try more.

Came on busy Saturday night. 4 of us got table. 8-10 minutes to get order from the table through the bartender. We got our food quickly, but drinks came after? My mint chocolate drink was over an inch lower from the small glass-disappointing for $10 as I sipped it down so fast. Probably won't be back for the slow blah experience- sorry from a polish girl : /

Great first opening night with free to play games. We came before 6pm and enjoyed the DJ, bartenders and the clean bathrooms (rare to find.) Will be back for more games and to try out the rest of the specialty drinks!
