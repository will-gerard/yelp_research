This is the best bike store I've been to yet in the Tempe area.  I've only been here for cheap parts, but they've got a wide selection of bikes and parts.  The staff are nice and helpful.

This place is great, if you're into over-priced drinks, date-rape, and the smell of Preparation H.

If you haven't been here, you're really missing on something special.  Many friends who have left town make sure to go here on return visits.  For those that don't know, a pasty is essentially a gourmet hot pocket.  They've got everything from standard meat and potatoes to a thanksgiving pasty with all the fixings, and plenty more.  The only pasty I didn't like was one with an ingredient I don't like, so I can't blame them.  I'm not even sure if they have other food, because I always get a pasty or two.  The beer selection is good, and the staff are great and very friendly.  The only downside is that this place is cramped and it can be hard to find a seat at times; there's only one table that can accommodate a crowd (+ the bar).  I hear the new location is better in this regard.

Ranch Market has a good selection of food from China and other East Asian countries.  This is where I go for okra and seafood to make gumbo.  They've got a large selection of frozen seafood and meat, and a decent selection of fresh.  Lots of produce, though some of it seems a bit less than fresh (I just go here for hard to find veggies, like okra).  This is definitely a great place to pick up rice, soy sauce, and soy beans for cheaper than at a Western grocery.  The biggest competitor for this place would probably be Lee-Lee's.  In my experience, this place wins on price.  For those that haven't been to either, this place is stocked primarily with East Asian faire, while Lee-Lee's is focused on East Asia, but has stuff from many other regions of the world.

For those that aren't familiar with it, Haru sushi is a rotating sushi bar.  Plates of half-rolls or two pieces of nigiri (the fish on rice, if I got that right), as well as drinks, desserts, edamame, and a few other things go around the bar on colored plates (color indicates the price).  Most of the plates are $1-2, some of the best sushi prices I've seen.  The sushi itself is good.  Not fantastic as far as I can tell, but not awful.  I'm no sushi nazi. If you don't see something you want, you can order it at the bar.  They've got a few beers, too.  I really like this place because I can fill up within 5 minutes of entering.  I've gone here a lot this summer, and the service was always good, and the food pretty consistent.

I've been to this location a number of times, and every time I've gone, the people who work there are dicks.  Maybe I just go at the wrong times or something, but I haven't been back here in a while.  They've got a lot in stock, but I'd recommend taking your business elsewhere.
