Yikes! This was my first time at The Melting Pot and I was not impressed. But before I rant about the poor quality of the food, let me say something nice. The manager came to our table to take a picture of us and she was really nice and told us to let her know if we needed anything. This was before we had any of the food. We did the 4 course meal and it looked all good on the menu. When they brought out the dipping options I was like what the heck is this? It look like cafeteria food. The bread was dry  and the veggies looked like they came out of a frozen bag . I kind of already knew where this was going. I liked the apples and that was about it . The salad was good . The main course was the worst . I guess I didn't expect to be making my food and boiling it . The chicken and shrimp were not my fave and half way cool I guess that's my fault and the steak was ok. I won't be going back there at all never again.

The customer service is the worst.. They all walk around in imaginary demon costumes because that's what they act like . Ashley Easley or at least that's what she tells customers is the most rudest person ever. It amazes me how they are still in business. I am a makeup artist and I work with a lot of other makeup artists in the industry which isn't very big in Arizona and I will make sure to let them know to stay 6000000 feet away from Easley's Dumb Shop! Thanks for nothing monsters of customer service you guys SUCK!

They are always so helpful. I took my car to the dealership and they took 3 hours to tell me what was wrong with my tire not to mention they were going to charge me to patch it up. I left there and raced down to Discount Tire Co. And they were so helpful right away! I've bought all four tires for my first car here and also for my newest car! I won't go anywhere else.

The nachos were amazing! And so were the coconut chicken strips. The service was a 8 out of a 10 because it was a slow night and the waitress took forever and a day to bring over ranch and water. I'll go back though because the food was that good!

I absolutely LOVE IT! The Philly roll with cream cheese and the Hawaiian roll are my jam! I about tried everything on the menu! Plus the staff are very friendly and helpful. They know exactly what everything is and give you good suggestions! If you want some quality sushi that's fast and amazing then go here.. It's a little high in price but it's worth it.

Gabe is worth the wait! He's the best.. The TVs all work and they're always playing a good funny action packed movie! Not to mention how friendly everyone is! I won't be going anywhere anytime soon. Unless all my hair falls off!

The lashes are way too expensive. And they are always out of the glue or #s of the eyelashes .

Amazing  I've been going here for a couple of months and I love it. I don't leave without being soaking wet! The trainers are very helpful and they work with your pace . I'm so happy I found a comfortable place to work out. I will keep going here until I'm skin and bones! Thank you Pro Edge Boxing!

I wanted to try out another laundromat to expand my options so I searched this one and picked coming here by the rating and the pictures. It looks really clean and quiet, not a lot of traffic. Well I was wrong . About 25 % of the washers are "OUT OF SERVICE" and 50 % of them are being over used by customers. The 24 hour laundromat is packed but there are always washers and dryers available. People are literally waiting here to use the washer and dryers. It's sad. They need to fix the washers and dryers ASAP. I rate this place 2 stars because it's about a dollar cheaper then the one I usually go to but in the case that half the dryers are broken I'll go ahead and pay the extra.

Stash House Az is the coolest place to get nail art. They welcome everyone and aren't snobby. The best part besides the services is the decor and music. If you don't come here, I'm sorry to hear about that!
