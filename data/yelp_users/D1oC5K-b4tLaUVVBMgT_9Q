first I'll tip my cap (or helmet... or whatever) to the staff. they were fantastic.  they gave me pointers to help me decimate the competition. which I did. I won 1st the first round and 2nd place the 2nd round. their secret was: gjxisowlanxncjfkdpalcjcnsmslr. decipher that and you're golden dudes.  the atmosphere is cool. there was 8 of us and we were able to sit at a table already set for us. if you have a bigger party make sure to reserve some spots in advance.  the karts were fun. I was Toad. I was nabbing blue shells left and right. DK and Bowser almost passed me when I hit a turn too fast but with carefully forward launched banana bunches and my trusty star I was able to pass them immediately.  amazing time. I'll be back.

If you were smart you'd stop scrolling, drop everything, and read this immediately.  I give this place an easy 5 stars. I booked my reservation on Open Table and we were seated immediately upon entering... Which reminds me... Think back to the first time you went to Disneyland. How about the first time you discovered the jar of powder sugar in the pantry? How about when you were reunited with your biological parents 27 years after growing up and finding out that at birth the hospital sent you home with the wrong family??? Yeah, the feeling I had when I walked in here tonight was something like that. I was home. And I was happy.  Our server was Debbie. Don't mess this up. Make sure you get her as your server. Just as a ship needs a compass and a rudder to guide you through a storm, so too did we need Debbie to lead us to culinary bliss.  The Neptune Mushrooms things were the way to start it off. It prepared us mentally for what was to come.  I ordered a New York Strip because I'm not a 7 year old girl ballet dancer. My wife got the sirloin. If you don't order it medium rare then you probably should just stay home and make a bowl of Cheerios so you don't screw up your life. The steaks were perfect. Like... Fit for Zeus perfect. In fact they may have even been prepared by Him for all I know.  Now enter the double baked potato. Wedge salad. Mushrooms. Peppers. And an extra side of asparagus because why wouldn't you do that?  Perfection. Every. Single. Thing. Perfection.  I washed it down with a Pepsi because the Keg cares deeply about people and knows that Coke is for convicts and the kids from the Sandlot.  It was everything I hoped it would be and more.  *mic drop*

It was average... Now I'm not Italian or anything, nor do I ever intend to be, but in my humble ignorant American opinion it was as we say here "meh".  First, be careful about the size of your party. Ours was a party of 6, they were basically empty and it took a while for them to set the table up. Party of 4 or less is the way to go here.  Their calamari was delicious. It took a while for it to come out, but it came out hot and tasty. Best thing I ate here.  I would strongly recommend against their Pollo a Marsala. It was average. Nothing special. Their pizza was decent enough. Again nothing special. I imagine most of those who have left overly positive comments about the pizza haven't had great pizza before.  My wife asked for a straw at the beginning of our meal and the server got caught up in a conversation and had completely forgot about the straw. To be fair it may have been such a good conversation that my wife's straw wasn't the least bit important, I'll be fair about it. I mean she is pregnant and high maintenance I guess. It's whatevs.  Check it out if you want. New places can be fun... I've never been to prison... maybe that'd be interesting?

Pleasantly surprised tonight.  My buddy has a Platinum membership and I will say that after seeing how Top Golf treated us as Platinum members and their guests, that is definitely the only way to go.  First they drove us in a limo up to the 3rd floor... at least they might as well had. They were extremely welcoming from the moment we walked in. I did lack direction when I first showed up. I was a newbie and the Top Golf veterans had already started. Luckily my buddy came and got me and showed me what to do.  We went to our place in the Platinum area and our server Ryan was rad. Super helpful. Management also made sure to stop by often to check on us and make sure we were doing well.  The food and drinks were brought out promptly and were delicious. They just have it all figured out.  The games were fun. I love to golf and I love hitting up the range but this was a whole new experience. Super fun. Not Star Wars role play fun but still... very entertaining.  I'll be recommending this place to everyone. Touch√© Top Golf.

My friends and their kids come to lots of parties here and they absolutely love it so my wife and I decided to try it out. They've got this stuff figured out. First, I tested my mettle on their ninja course... let's just say there's a reason why I don't try and compete in American Ninja Warrior. We played some dodgeball and that was a blast. The ref was pretty funny too. I landed more flips than my wife in their foam pits. Had to throw that on here. When we were done we decided to eat at their Krazy Sub shop. I ordered a Poorboy sub sandwich and it tasted as if some Greek god found me worthy of it and decided to bestow it upon me. 3 thumps up. (I was born with 3 thumbs... idk it's chill)
