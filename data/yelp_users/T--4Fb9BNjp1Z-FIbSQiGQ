I came in 15 min before close for a gel full with regular polish. My nail tech did an amazing job!! He did not rush even though they were closing soon. He turned my ugly square nails into beautiful round shape. I usually go with gel but we will see how long the regular polish lasts. I would definitely recommend this place .

I had my appointment with Priscilla for a first time curly cut and absolutely loved everything about Curls Gone Wild. Priscilla taught me about how to care for curls , what products to use and most importantly NOT use, and how to style my hair. This place is a curly headed girls dream. After years of straightening and frying my hair I'm finally back on the road to pretty healthy curls. I'll definitely be coming back.

Fuller's is one one of my favorite local spots in Chandler! I love coming here for their $3 Four Peaks Brews specials on Saturday. I am also a HUGE fan of their beer battered (hop knot) fish n chips! This stuff is great! They also have great Karaoke.. The staff and owners are great and give good service. Beer buckets only $10 and you can bring back "beer chips" that you don't use!

Very unfortunate experience. I was looking forward to trying on dresses at this boutique after reading reviews and seeing photos. However, my experience today was horrible! My mother and I made a 2:30 appointment and arrived at 2:33. We even called to say we were going to be a few min late. When we got there no one greeted us. We looked around for a few more minutes and at 2:45 we were still waiting for help. One of the groups had left at 2:45 ,but still no one came to speak us. Finally at 3:00 we left. There was another mother daughter group who came and left at the same time we did. Looks like they lost two customers today. shopping for something like a $2,000 dress, you would expect some great service, but you won't find that at Luv.
