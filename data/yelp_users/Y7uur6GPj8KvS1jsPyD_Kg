I just got married here in September and I truly loved it!!  This place is a little gem.  The Regency Garden gave us a weddings all inclusive menu that took the hunt out of finding the right people to do the job!!!  It was beautiful, and elegant and at the same time not stuffy or plain.  I would definitely refer my friends to get married here.    The only complaint that I have is that the photographers could have done a better job as well as offer a better package with the Regency Garden.  On that note they have tried to accommodate and fix the issue, but you just can't get back pictures that weren't taken, especially on your wedding day....

All I can say is amazing! And THANK YOU! I am a new to Global Chiropractic but my husband has been coming for a while now. I work on my feet at a bar and lug heavy ice buckets and kegs around. For the passed few months I have been super sore and achy and just plain drained. My husband has been trying to get me to go for a while now and it wasn't until my back and neck completely locked up that I agreed to go. I had never been to a chiropractor before and was skeptical. I'm happy to say that my experience has been great and I am feeling so much better after just a couple of adjustments. I have mobility back in my arm, neck and my shoulder! What a relief! From the moment I walked in everyone has been so welcoming and helpful. I have never felt like I was in the dark or that my pain was under estimated. Ann up in the front is always friendly and helpful in getting me checked in, the massage therapists are amazing and Dr. Steve takes the time to explain everything that is going on with my back and neck from the X-rays to the equipment to the actual adjustment. I am a happy patient and would definitely recommend Global Chiropractic to anyone!

My family and I love this place!!!  The food is so tasty!  I love soup in the winter and salad in the summer so I can come here year round.... My favorite soup is the potato cream cheese and the broccoli cheese and you just can't go wrong with the Mediterranean Salad.  Among my favorites of soups and salad I also have to say that I have all wonderful experiences with all the different foods I've tried there.  The BLT with Avocado and Cheese, The Ham Sandwich and the Raviolis!!!  Okay I'm hungry again.

Our experience here was not good.  We took the kids to see Santa and were given a pass to come back in an hour and 15 minutes.  We decided to eat here since we were here.  It took about 7 minutes to get a table, there was no one in front of us.  We sat down and our server proceeded to tell us that she was tired and had been there since 11am. In our party were 4 adults, 1 teenager, 2 six year olds and 2 two year olds.  We all ordered water and some juice for the kids and 1 beer and our food at the same time.  We did not get our water or any other drinks served to us until about 2 minutes before the food came out.  This server just couldn't  handle it.  She put the small kids drinks in regular cups and then at the end asked if we wanted them in kids cups.  The whole experience was just ridiculous.  Everything took so long that as soon as it came we had to ask to our food to go since we were waiting to see Santa.  When we got in out 7 pm line we waited another hour before we just left. I asked an associate what was going on and he told me that there was a Members party there at the time and they got to take precedence over everyone else.... Very DISAPPOINTED......

LOVE this little Sushi Bar!!!  My husband and I come here with our 2 kids all the time.  The staff is extremely friendly and no one minds the kids.... Granted, our kids are huge sushi fans, they both know their way around the menu, and can use their chopsticks, plus they eat everything!!!  They are pretty well behaved, too.  Masa gives you the best in a meal, as soon as you are seated you are greeted with hot miso soup and a salad that has the most fantastic dressing ever!!  The edemame is always hot and salted, the sashimi is always fresh and the rolls are fantastic. Don't forget about the AMAZING dessert they serve after your meal!!!  Masa has awesome lunch and happy hour specials too!!!  I just can't say enough about this wonderful little sushi bar!!!

Absolutely Awful EXPERIENCE!!!!  If you are a bride please don't waste your time here.  There is absolutely no customer service.  My bridesmaid dresses were not delivered as promised we had to come back 3 times to pick them up and each time we went they were not there.  The ladies that were there had no tact.  They don't return calls, or answer the phones, the store is nasty, disgusting and filthy.  Needless to say we ended up getting all 5 of our dresses for free, it was a huge hassle but it happened.  DON'T PURCHASE ANYTHING FOR YOUR WEDDING HERE IF YOU ARE ON A TIME SCHEDULE!!
