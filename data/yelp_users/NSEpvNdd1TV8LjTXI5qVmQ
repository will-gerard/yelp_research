Walked out when I realized they put MSG in their food. :S I have tasted their take out before at a family Members house. It was delicious which is what brought me into the restaurant. But when I asked if they use MSG they said yes. Rather get of PF changs or pei Wei. Even Panda Express doesn't use msg. It's bad stuff.

Very cool, great music. Study room but beware of the smoke cloud surrounding the outside. Can't sit outside unless you want to leave smelling like smoke.

The most amazing vegan foods and teas BUT the worst service EVER!  It can take an hour or two to see your food and because of that I can't go. And with the food running so slow you would think they would be apologetic but the waiters are stuck in a meditation trance of rudeness and don't acknowledge it or you. I've gone 3 times hoping a different waiter would help or a different day but no luck. Unless you have all day to kill don't go

1st it's actually circle K. Ahhh run. Don't come at night time! They have to hire security guard sometimes because so much goes down. It's clean and everything but attracts the most ghetto crowd. Don't feel safe

I've been going to their first location in phoenix for years and it was always amazing. Tempe location is like the evil step sister. Ive been to this location dozens of times and everytime was bad customer service. Everything from messing up orders (and not claiming fault!), burning food, and NO SMILES! They act like I'm an inconvenience every time. They never show appreciation to their customers. NO welcomes! NO thank yous! I wonder if anyone there has ever smiled. Today was the final straw. Breakfast burrito over cooked and they forget my salsa. The real ticker though was when she gave me my total, I passed her my money and she received a text....started to text back while I had my hand held out with the money. RUDE! Dlish is 1 mile away and waaaaaay better breakfast burrito plus they love their customers!!

Wanted to find a good breakfast place along the light rail. FOUND IT! A fast causal breakfast with a fine dining feel. Nice happy employees, clean and sunny environment. I got the eggs Benedict (hard to make perfect but it was good) $8.5 my daughter had the pancakes with blueberries and REAL CREAM. Best pancakes and value. $6.5 Hubby had waffles with strawberries and real cream $6.5 Then we tried the hulk smoothie. The smoothie was mostly just ice so wasn't impressed by that 5$ So fair prices for a nice breakfast experience.

Went there yesterday with my 20 month old, the people behind the front desk were so sweet and very child friendly. The office itself is wonderful! Toys, TV, books, puzzles, coloring, and even a TV above the dentist chair. The dentist taught me great tips on how to  brush my little girls teeth and went above and beyond to be kind and gentle with her. Looking forward to this place being her dentist for many years to come

Really hope this is read before some gets taken advantage of. Alan is quite the con artist. After being robbed in my house rental I asked the landlord to buy a security system. The company was recommended to him from someone at his church. He generously payed $600 to put alarms on 4 doors and 3 windows. After those steep prices he couldn't afford to secure my other 3 windows and garage door. So for $600 dollar I couldn't even get my 1600 sq ft house fully secure.   We signed a contract to pay $34 dollars a month for Bear 2 Protection security services. After 2 years our monitor started to show an error code. I called him to asked what was going on he told me a very long charming story of how the whole network in the country just upgraded to 4G. My monitor is now having a hard time connecting and I need to pay $400 dollars to upgrade it to the 4G network. I had a baby due in a matter of days and financially already pushed to the max. I balled. So he said he will do me a huge favor and only charge 299. family prices. I told him I didn't have the money and my landlord couldnt pay either. I asked if I was still being "protected" and he said "absolutely" its just a low signal and thats why I'm getting an error code. Well I called around to other alarm companies to see if they were doing this too. They all said no! That if a security company needs to upgrade to work then obviously they would be responsible to do it, not the client!!! Then my husband and I looked up the error code and it didnt mean low signal, it meant NO signal. I called alan and he said he will come out and look at it. Usually he charges 75$ for a visit. This time because he "really wants to help me out" he wont charge but next time he will...Geeze thanks.  Now since I stay at home and deal with household matters my husband was not aware that Alan and I agreed to the 34 dollars. SO when his account for 2 years was being charged 54 dollars, he didnt know that was wrong. I confronted Alan about it and as usual he tried to smooth talk through it. He said that I should have been charged more when we initially installed our equipment and he was making up for it. WOW. I asked him just pay me back for the last payment and end our services. I was so pregnant, hurting, and didnt have the energy to get 3TV on my side but now after 10 months regret not doing so.   Alan is one of the best talkers I've ever met. He will stress how much he likes you so hes going to give you and only you an amazing deal. Meanwhile he's actually taking you for a ride. I know hes had some nice reviews. Maybe its family or maybe recently hes started an addiction and needs to rip people off to pay it.Whatever it is, its not right.

Worlds Worst Frijoles. I ordered a small side of rice and beans for my toddler. How can you mess that up? The beans came out looking like soupy sewage mess, plus tasted funky. The rice resembled something from a frozen package. Truly disgusting. My burrito was the same quality. I returned the food, paid for my drink, and left to find some good Mexican! Manager also didn't acknowledge the situation at all. When I approached him he just stared at me and said nothing.
