I needed some maintenance on my 7.3 Superduty, chose Dana Bros based on the reviews here. Very glad I did. They got me in right away and finished all of the work quickly. Excellent communication, they called at every step along the way as they were diagnosing my issues. Everything is fixed up perfectly and the price was right too. This will definitely be my go to shop in the future.

Came here to have HAZMAT certification removed from my CDL. First tried on a Friday at 9:00am. By 2:00pm there were still 20 people ahead of me. Had to leave. Came again on Monday, got my number at 10:28am. Didn't call me up until 1:55pm.   Once I was called it took less than a minute for them to do what I came for.   The people working the desk were friendly and helpful, can't fault them for anything. It's just a terrible, terrible system. People coming in just to drop off paperwork have to wait in line behind dozens of people taking drivers tests. Arizona needs to authorize third party DMV to handle all motor vehicle transactions. I would have been in and out of Desert Title in 5 minutes.

I had a malfunctioning pump on a waterfall in my backyard. Donnie came by and checked it out. He gave me some (free) advice on how I might be able to fix it myself. When we determined the pump was actually broken, Donnie came back and replaced it. The service and price were both excellent.

I have to fly Allegiant often because I fly between Phoenix and Idaho Falls for work. They are the only company offering a direct flight, and it's about 1/3 the price of the other airlines. So I appreciate that they can offer this flight at a great price.   However...hold times are HORRIBLE.  I need to call the airline frequently to change flights when plans change.  Changes can't be made online if the flight is in the next 72 hours... so I usually have to call. I'm on hold now as I type this, 67 minutes and counting. Last phone call was over an hour on hold. 40+ minutes the call before that.   So basically I hate this company with all my heart.

Joe and his crew do great work. Best place in the valley for your Vette or whatever else.

I really want to support new breweries. I spend a lot of time and money at San Tan, Wilderness, and 4 Peaks. I was excited to try out The Perch. The excitement did not last. I had one beer (4 Peaks Hop Knot) and left.   The music sucks. If I want to hear Margaritaville and easy listening classics I'll go on a 55+ cruise. This alone was enough to drive me out.   The brewery itself is decent, but it's in the ghetto and surrounded by trash. The appeal of sitting on the 2nd story balcony is lost when you are looking down on piles of garbage.   While looking at the large cockatoo on the first floor, I was told by a staff member that the bird is 'a vicious animal, a face biter and he will tear your fingers right off'. Doesn't seem like the best idea to have this bird in the middle of a bar, in a cage with large openings, but what do I know.   The seating on the upper level is from an old nightclub. I remember seeing it for sale on Craigslist. It is completely out of place and uncomfortable.

These guys did great work. Jesse and his crew removed about ten tons of old rock and dirt from my backyard and replaced it with river rock and sod. Great people to work with and they did excellent work. Price was right too.
