I've been here a few times before and have had really bad service so I didn't plan on coming back, however my friend was a fan and so I came back with her and I have to say, I'm glad I did! Drink specials are awesome. During happy hour all drinks are half off!! And it seems like there is a completely different service staff, our waitress had personality and really took good care of us, drinks never were empty and she refered the guacamole and hawiians gone fishing (both were yummy). Everyone seemed to smile as they walked by and helped clear empty plates or glasses. Even the girl that brought out the food (not our server) made sure we had everything we needed,..definatly had a good time and now ill be the one bringing my friends back!

This place had horrible service. My girlfriend and I were going to meet up with some friends who were already sitting on the patio at 845 on Saturday night. We joined them at a table, no one greeted. They had already paid but said there was a server who was serving them so we expected someone to come by the table to see if we wanted drinks. No one came. There were two other tables outside sitting with no menus or drinks. After 15 minutes, one of the groups moved inside. We decide that was the only way to get any service so we went inside to get drinks. Bartender didn't understand the drink that we ordered, which was off the menu. Drinks were good, but would not come back. As a first impression, the service was horrible.
