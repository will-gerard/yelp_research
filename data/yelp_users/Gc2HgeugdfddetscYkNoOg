I absolutely love postino arcadia. The bruschetta is always delicious and the wine deals are great! Everyone is always very nice and friendly!

I went to Sakana for the first time this week and had a great experience! Decided to sit at the sushi bar, and quickly ordered my 3 favorite sushi items. The rolls were HUGE! So delicious and everything was really fresh. Our waitress was nice... I told her I wanted a nice glass of white wine and, ironically, she ended up bringing me my favorite white wine of all time - Kim Crawford Sav. Blanc. Perfect! I love when restaurants have that on their menu.  The sushi chefs were fun and entertaining, and even handed us some fun, new, off-menu stuff to try.  The food and service was great. I'll be back again!

This place used to be so great. Not anymore... Terrible the last 3 times I've been in! So sad.

I ended up at Steven Paul when my stylist, Kandi, relocated there. I love the quirkiness of this salon! The energy is great! The ceiling is fun to look at when your having your hair washed (very unique) and there are tons of fun gift items up front to browse. I am always offered water or coffee upon arrival.  This place has done it right!

This place is awesome! Best nail salon I have experienced in a long time. Great prices, great polish selection, and I even got a shoulder massage while my nails were drying. I'll be back!

I love paradise bakery, but the last experience I had at Tempe Marketplace was not good. I feel like the food quality has gone down dramatically since I first started eating there. Not to mention, the customer service. I stood in front of the salad bar for about 5 minutes waiting for help before I was acknowledged... while at least three employees stood to the side chatting. Then, they were rude when I seemed impatient. Then, once I received my half sandwich, it was made with the wrong bread.  This location is my least favorite. I tend to have a hard time finding seating, and the place just seems messy.   On a more positive note, the cookies were great as usual :)

This is the worst Starbucks of all time. Drinks are always bad -- or completely wrong. Slow service. Disgusting bathrooms. Annoying baristas.   I only go here if I'm desperate for caffeine, in a rush, and don't have time to walk to Royal...

This place is amazing. I go out of my way to get coffee here because they can make my lattes with coconut milk. LOVE. They also use Cartel coffee. Doesn't get much better than that!

Not impressed. WAY too much mayo... bad bread... overall just not that great. If you want a good sub go to Jersey Mikes - Their subs are amazing!

I love this place! I'm an ASU downtown student and its perfect for a quick, healthy meal. I can get grilled chicken, veggies, and brown rice. The place is always clean and the service is always GREAT. Plus they gave me 10% off for no reason today. I'll take it!  Oh, and they have a really good green peach iced tea too.  I have never had a bad experience here, and I'll miss it when I graduate!

I can't say enough about this place! The food is always delicious. Great atmosphere. Great service. Today my friend and I split the mushroom pizza and the kale salad. SOOOO good!!! I also had the antioxidant juice which was amazing. Love it.

This place does not impress... but I wish that it did! Sometimes all I want is a salad, but not a $15 one that I have to put together myself. The meat looks... weird. It's always empty. I would rather get a snack at Starbucks next door. I agree with the other review that the quality is not that great.

This place is pretty bad ass. Organized seating. Efficient drink service. Funny comedian. I laughed the whole time! I had a great experience and will definitely be back soon. Cheers!

Just picked up take-out from Zoe's after ordering online. The whole process was super quick and easy. I literally walked in, was handed my order, and walked out. Paid online... It was was great! Then, the food was DELISH! First time visitor, so I didn't know what to expect. I'll be honest , I needed hangover food, but wanted to stay relatively healthy. I'm so glad I chose this place. I can see why people love it! My friend and I shared the chicken rollups with the white beans as a side and the chicken salad sampler plate. Everything was great and I don't feel bad about eating it either.  I'll be back to try other menu items for sure :)

Yesterday was my second time at Primp and Blow. The first time was pretty good, and I needed to have my hair done for date night so I thought I would give it a second try. It's only $35 right? Wrong. My advice is to save your $$.   First of all, the ladies up front were completely rude. I showed up early for my appt. (WHAT A CRIME) and was basically treated like dirt. They told me to come back because nothing was available until my appt. time. OK, That was all good until the owner walked up and told the girl helping me at the front desk that she had to do my hair. Turns out they are both stylists (not receptionists) and just didn't want to take a walk-in appt. AWKWARD!!!!  Not only that, but my hair was already shampooed, I had just come from home. Talk about the easiest client ever! She was so obviously upset about having to do my hair that I almost walked out... Not at all welcoming.  Service was poor from the beginning to the end. She spent about 20 minutes on my hair (While the girl next to me was given much more time and attention by her stylist)... and the blowout was terrible. Not good. In fact, parts of my hair were still wet when I left. HUH???? That is your only task... to dry hair.   I paid my $35. Didn't tip, and won't ever be back. In fact, I think i'll check out their competitors.
