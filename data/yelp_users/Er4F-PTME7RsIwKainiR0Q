Don't visit or eat at this Denny's! They won't accept online coupons! Manager when asked why not, he gave an excuse that accounting won't take it. No way to honor veterans on this Memorial Day! Next time we're eating at a local restaurant!!!

I hosted office holiday party on Friday night at 7 for 10 people. Restaurant was not busy at all. Although food was very good, service by Sheila was very poor. Dishes were not picked up. Drinks were not refilled. She was not very attentive to our requests and we had to ask for service. What was very disappointing was when I let manager know, she just said sorry repeatedly, but gave no explanation or incentive for us to return. If you're planning a memorable get together with a group of people, pass on Mimi's Cafe and go somewhere else that appreciates your business.

New management continues to not appreciate loyal customers! Besides increasing the number of stamps to get a free meal from 8 to 10, you can only redeem one completed "Best Things In Life Card" at a time! Food is not all that great and pricey. People serving are great! Suggest go to a local restaurant and help the Arizona economy versus going to the Good Egg!

The food at Brunchies is okay, however, the manager, Caroline, is not very accommodating for large groups of professionals that would like to hold meetings every week.  Simple requests to save our spot, turning down the music, flexibility with breakfast specials, etc., etc. is not welcomed and met with NO I CAN NOT DO THAT since I have other customers!  Well if this local eaterie is to survive, the Serrano family needs to know how to manage their employees.  I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND BRUNCHIES!  I suggest spending your $$$ at another local restaurant that appreciates you!

Unfortunately with new ownership of all the Good Eggs, the frequent diner card is now buy 10 meals, get one free. It used to be 7 meals. I guess new ownership doesn't care about loyal customers! Food is okay and pricey. Wait staff is great!

Support local Arizona businesses such as Tott's! Great food at a very competitive price. Mr. Young is fabulous as he greets every customer. Better alternative to Pei Wei and Panda Express which are very "corporate and not local". I will definitely support Tott's again!

Never order take out lunch to pick up at this location. Although placed order at 1140 am and told food would be ready in 20 minutes, I arrived at 1210 pm to pay and pick up food only to wait another 10 minutes. Excuse given was "You should've ordered earlier!" If a restaurant can't handle the lunch business, don't have take out!!! I support local restaurants, but can't support Zipps on their lack of customer service.

Cheap!  Cheap!  Beware!  If you order Chicken McNuggets from this McDonald's they will charge you 10 cents for each sauce packet over the alloted quantity.  Either go to another McDonald's where they don't charge, go to another restaurant that values your business and NOT nickel and dime you to death or don't eat!

I had the grilled chicken over chilled rice noodles. Lots of fresh toppings and variety of sauces. Open a location in Chandler please!!!
