I have taken my mom here twice and was really pleased with the service each time. Get the shrimp wrapped in pancetta.  Yummy! I also crave...no...I mean...CRAVE their lobster bisque a few times a year!  It's rich, creamy, with a bit of a kick.  I always order a tub to take home with me. My only gripe?  When the heck is it opened consistently?  Argh!

I started a new job and the bosses brought us here for lunch.  It was ok.  I got a lunch combo meal, but I didn't pay. The service was really great but the food was not.  Just kind of plain.   It's convenient to work, so I will probably be back, I just won't have very high expectations.

Horribly sweaty girl is hungry after Critical Mass.  Cheese on the mind.  Critical Mass ended by going down Central and I had never been to Cheuvront before.  Luckily, I was with Ayesha and it took nothing to convince her to go there.   There were 7 of us and they were extremely quick in pushing table together for us.  They didn't even mind our sweat and water bottles.  The server even filled Ayesha's for her.   I took one look at the menu and my eyes stopped at the bottom: macaroni and cheese.  I rarely eat it, but as soon as I saw it, I wanted.  Badly.  Ayesha said she liked the bleu cheese.  SOLD!  I effing love bleu cheese.   For $8, I think it was a good value.  It was a good portion, but not too much.  Rich and creamy with gargantuan hunks of genuine bleu cheese, that had started to melt.  It was incredibly filling for the size! Downfall: Unisex bathrooms.  What the hell!  I don't care how nice a place is, guys still piss all over the place. The mac and cheese is $5 during the week during happy hour.  I will be back for it, most definitely! Huge points for the server who took Amy in stride when I told him I'd spank his ass for something.  (I don't remember, as it was 109 degrees and I had been on my bike for over 2 hours.)

I've been here a few times and went again last night for Adults' Night Out.  I thought the weather exhibit was pretty cool, except for the rain part.  I mean, it was Friday night and MY HAIR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Good thing I picked up The New Times to cover my head with. I also went for Body World about a year an a half ago. I love the set-up of the museum.  It's easy to navigate.  The people who work there *really* dig their jobs.  I ran into the projectionist after the exhibit at the Rose and Crown.  He seemed pretty happy! I live so close, I should get a membership, but I'm afraid of commitment.

I've been coming here for YEARS and just thought to review it?  WTF is wrong with me??????????????????????? THIS is Mexican seafood.  I've been to other places and nothing compares!  I take a book, sit in back and people watch while creaming my "Make Me Yelp" panties as I eat my culichi.  It's D I V I N E!  Eat the shrimp with a fork but you sure as Hell better use a spoon to destroy the rest of the bowl and leave it clean! Everything is fresh and the wait staff is loaded with recommendations.  Ask, and ye shall find.  The snapper Veracruz is so good I often order 2 and take one home.   The decor is fun - aquatic scenes that won't make you feel guilty for eating the seafood in front of you.   At Xmas they had a Santa at the door!  The people here a super-friendly!   They have their own parking lot.  You know it's a good place when yours isn't the fanciest car in the parking lot.  All kinds come here, despite the neighborhood not being the nicest in DoPho.  You can't miss it - even though I do pass it every time!  I think I'm too excited thinking of the shrimp culichi and my mouth is watering so much that I always manage to say "Crap, passed it again!" Go.  Just go to this place.  You won't be disappointed.  I swear.  And, you won't break the bank.

I can't believe I waited 11 years to go here. I love nature. I love being outside.  I'm in love. In fact, my first visit 2 months ago inspired my mom to get us both memberships.  I loved the tour of the main loop. We learned a lot about some of the plants. I've worked in landscaping and know a lot about desert plants, but we learned a lot of cultural stuff, too.  I went back for the Chihuly exhibit. It's the coolest thing I have ever seen, and some of the sculptures were so beautiful I cried a little.  The staff is a lot of volunteers, so you know they enjoy being there. In fact, I am going to talk to them about volunteering as soon as the holidays are over. I can't wait to go again!

I am not really sure why people keep going back to Yoshi's!  I ate it once.  ONCE.  It was right across the street from work (the Indian School & Central location) and everyone went there everyday.  So, I figured I would try it.  Now, I ordered chicken, but I'm really not sure what meat it was OR what part of the chicken it was from.  It was really string-fatty-grizzly.  Teriaki sauce was good and the rice was ok, if a bit *too* sticky for my liking.

I got take-out from CherryBlossom tonight.  I was getting a pedicure next door and Helen, who does a FABULOUS job on my toesies, told me to try the Pad Thai. I was greeted as soon as I walked in the door.  There were 3 choices:  chicken, shrimp and/or tofu.  I got the shrimp/tofu Pad Thai. As I sat down, I realized I was sitting next to the biggest jerk/douche EVER!  He must have been on a date and I felt *really* sorry for the really pretty girl with the foreign accent sitting with him.  His cell rang AND HE ANSWERED IT!  In a restaurant!  his schnoz rivaled Seinfeld's.  He even got angry that their server came by and left because he was on the phone.  She told them it was policy not to disturb.  Fine enough!   Seriously, if I were sitting to eat next to him and not just waiting for take-out, I would have requested another table.  He bugged me THAT much. It didn't take more than 10 minutes for me to get my food.  Got home, it was still piping hot.  Generous portion of shrimp and TONS of crushed peanuts.  Yummy!  The sauce had a nice sweet/tang to it.  I saved half to eat later.  Or tomorrow, but it was so good, that I will probably eat it later tonight.  It was a little over $10 with tax.  Not bad for two meals!

Holy crikes this rugalach is amazing!  Cheese-filled with fruit and I think chocolate.   Walking into Karsh's with my Groupon in hand, I thought I'd landed back in mama's womb.  Pastry is one of my comfort foods.  Flaky, buttery and chilled to the right temperature.  I'm not saying mama's womb was flaky but... I also got an eclaire, some mini-pastries and a white cake that's covered with chocolate icing, then rolled in coconut.  That's in the freezer until book club night! The service was wonderful!  I got to try a bunch of different sweets and left with a huge bag of stuff.  For my $20-valued Groupon, I will be eating this for a week.  A WEEK. Only bad thing is that it's close enough that I can walk there.

The cool thing about they Rhythm Room is the variety of people there. Almost every time I go, there's a girl on the dance floor...on roller skates!  Then there will be a few punk-types, rockabilly, country, of all ages.  That's the kind of place I like. Also, if you get hungry, there's a guy out back in a trailer selling pork sandwiches.  Not the greatest, but perfect after a night of live music

*IF* a car-buying experience could go smoothly, then this was it!  I wasn't even wanting or needing a new car. I had a 2008 Rabbit & absolutely loved it. I went in for an oil change. Got a text from a sales person about my car. Kind of freaked me out, but ok. I told him I was quite happy with my car, but if I could get EXACTLY what I wanted, for nothing more than I was already paying, then he'd have a sale. Done. The deal was done in two days. Got my windows tinted, too.  The service department is REALLY good, too. Giuseppe is attentive and precise. I've already gotten my service scheduled for 90 days out. They provide a shuttle service, too.  Antoine got my deal done quickly and with zero hassle.  It's my third car from this dealership. The service department has always been the reason I go back there. Now, the entire staff is responsible.

How did I not know this existed?  It's within walking distance from home! Went with Chrissy P for a New Year's Day brunch.  It's so freaking hard to find a good NY-style deli up in here! Got there before her, so I grabbed a take-out menu.  Holy lox, Batman (I usually say "Holy frijoles, but it's a Jewish deli, get it??) the menu is HUGE! They have a full breakfast menu with omelets, Jewish staples like lox, blintzes and matzo brie.  There are huevos rancheros, skillet dishes to round out the breakfasts. Many different smoked fish dishes, too.   I had the egg salad sandwich on wheat bread.  *Real* wheat bread.  Though I think the egg salad was missing something, it was still delicious.  Also got a side of fries.  They were homemade crinkle-cut, with the skins still on them!  I love fries with the skin still there.   Service was ultra-friendly and we never had to ask for a refill on our drinks. I will definitely be back.  It will take forever to get through the menu, even for a pescatarian like me.

Went last night for karaoke with Flamin' Steve and Jenni from work.  What a blast!   It's a gay bar, but there were a bunch of us "straighties" there, too. Great selection of songs!  The guy who runs it has been running karaoke there for 15 years!   It's nicely decorated.  I guess it used to be a real dive.   The "goddesses'" room was clean.  No water on the floor here!   I gotta say, though, that gay men sing the slooooooooooooowest songs!  If it weren't for my Danzig, AC/DC and Right Said Fred renditions, I would have fallen asleep! The staff is awesome!  Everyone in the crowd was really friendly and I will definitely go back!

Totally awesome customer service! I bought my neighbor's bike last week and wanted to accessorize it.  You know, bling it out.  Bedazzle it.  First, though, I needed tubes. Sun was definitely the place to go.  Everyone was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable.   They have a huge selection of bikes.  It doesn't look like it from the outside, but there have got to be a gazillion bikes up in here. I brought Dexter, of course.  He was a hit, I tell ya. About a week later, it was time to get a basket.  I wanted one that The Dex could fit into, so I brought him with me, again.  I like places where I can take him with me.  It makes the world feel like a better place. Anyway, found a big basket that I can fit Dexter into, or my laptop, whichever activity I'm about to do.  The manager, Joe, told me to bring my bike in to have the basket installed.   These guys are great and I'm so glad I can ride my bike around the corner to the store.  I'll be a frequent shopper!

OMFG!!!!!!!!!!!  I went here for lunch today and they had lobster tail tacos.  I come to this location about once a month.  It's incredibly clean and the service is always friendly.  I like to see confusion on peoples' faces when I break out my Spanish and place my order.   The lobster tail tacos were A M A Z I N G!!!!!!!!!  Big hunks of lobster tail (langostino) and a pinkish sauce served in huge corn tortillas.  I got the combo, which comes with a side of rice and a side of beans.  You can choose refried or black.  I love their black beans. Another thing I love about Baja Fresh is their salsa bar.  My favorite is the baja.  It's a smoky chipotle salsa.  I always get a bunch of different salsas to take home with me.  Their green salsa changed, but it's still really good and tastes so fresh. There are NO microwaves here.  I have a "thing" about microwaves and rarely use mine at home.  I think it's strange to heat up food without something...hot.  *shudder* Anyway, it's a clean facility with fresh food and many different options.  I'm still thinking about my langostino tacos, even if this is a chain.

This is one of my very favorite stores in the Valley!  The first thing I always do, is make my way to the back to the grocery section.  They've got foods from all over the world (that you won't find at TJ's or AJ's) and delicacies that take me back to my travels. Next, I do the wall decor.  I've gotten some really cool iron hangings for my living room.   Next, the furniture!  I have been shopping for bedroom furniture for 2 months and I always make my way to Cost Plus World Market.  The prices are REALLY reasonable (and it's real wood!) and they have a delivery option.   I call the style of this store "funky urban".  I prefer it over Pier 1.

So, for my date tonight to the Compass Room, I needed to get my nails done.  I removed my acrylics myself last week.   I read the reviews here and decided to try DV. You know, sometimes when you walk into a nail shop for the first time, it's almost like the Soup Nazi.  Not this place! There were two girls ahead of me, so I waited a bit, but only about ten minutes.   It's bigger than the place I had been going to!  Really clean and I heard ENGLISH being spoken by the nail techs!  That was nice.  Yeah, there were still speaking Vietnamese (or so I think) to each other, yes, probably about us gringas, but it was refreshing to hear actualy conversations. I had Le.  She was so sweet!  I told her all about my date, too. She was quick, and made some suggestions about what to get.  Usually I like clear tips that they have to paint.  I was kinda short on time, so I went with her suggestion of white tips.  Plus, it was about $5 cheaper. She was quick but *really* methodical.   I think this may be the nicest set of acrylics I've gotten out here in the PHX! She even called me by name throughout the conversation. $25 for a new full set.  Not bad at all

*pffffffft*  That's how you spell the sound of a fart.  And that's exactly what I did for 2 days this week, after my trip to Arriba. It's basic Mexican fare.  We had a group of about 12 and they were great taking care of us.  I never had to ask for my iced tea to be refilled.   The food?  We made a list at work ahead of time and ordered it right before we left the office.  I ordered the fish taco dish.  It came with a side of refried beans and rice.  The beans were nasty and then I realized they probably weren't vegetarian, so I only had a bite and put them aside.  The rice was...rice.  The only way it had any flavor was because I had doused it with hot sauce.   The fish taco?  No flavor!  The fish was grilled, but I could barely taste it.  Everything was covered in some sort of white sauce and it was all that flavorful, but still covered up any flavor that *could* be in the fish taco.  I still prefer Two Hippies. The service was great, but it was really the only thing memorable.  I doubt I'd go back there.   *pffffffffffffft*

There aren't as many places with the service and friendly staff as PCG!  I've only been there for the Yelp event, but I will definitely go back based solely on the treatment we all got from the staff. The food was amazing with combos that were perfect.  The coconut shrimp was my very favorite and I am always down for fruit and cheese. This place is very close to home and I will become a regular, whether they like it or not.

I desperately needed a new computer this past weekend.  Both my PCs were fried.  Fried more than I was in the 80s (ohhhhh the LSD then was phenomenal!).  Fried like they wouldn't even turn on.  Old.  Not worth fixing.  I was going to buy my very first laptop!  (Don't laugh.  I'm cooler than you anyway.) So, I walked the computer section for a few moments.  There were 4 or 5 salesboys standing around, nobody on me like a hawk.  That's good, because I pretty much knew what I wanted.  So, I shout, "Who wants commission??" and 3 of them say "We don't make commission."  Whatever.  I am in sales and know that's a sales line.  Ha! So, I ask a guy to compare two of the laptops and he was straight-up honest.  Both were within $50 as far as their prices and I chose the Dell.  He even gave me 10% off.  I'm not telling you which cutie he was, because I want to feel special about my discount. Didn't try too hard to sell me on the Geek Squad warranty.  Left happy and it didn't take forever.  AND I'm typing on my new laptop RIGHT now!

When you leave the dentist's office with a smile on your face, you know you've found the right one! I had a filling fall out, which took part of my tooth.  I was also due for a cleaning and X-rays.   The appointment was set for 2 hours (first visit, always 2 hours) and I was out in just over that. The hygienist, Carrie, was awesome!  She cracked a few jokes and didn't ask my too many questions while her fingers were in my mouth. Than came Rachel with my X-rays.  She warned me it might be painful, but it wasn't.  I can't believe the technology they have here! Dr Schneider had an awesome sense of humor and handled mine really well.  He was upfront about what it would take to repair my tooth.  Crown or implant.   They are going to send the diagnosis for pre-approval to my insurance company first.  I'll know in 2 to 3 weeks.   I actually enjoyed myself here.  Beat sitting at work!

HUGE selection!  Went with my lil sis last night.  She had oysters for an appetizer, I had the crab/shrimp combo cocktail.  Delish!  The oysters were perfectly briny. I was SO thankful they had an extensive grilled menu!  The mahi mahi had just the right spice to it.  The steamed veggie side was big enough to be satisfying.   Our waitress was right on the ball for refills on our drinks, too.  Super friendly with great recommendations.   They print up the menu everyday.  I'm not sure how I feel about this.  I know they have different fresh things everyday, but it seems like a waste of paper to me.  Blame my hippie mom.

When you go, get the Thai sticks as an appetizer! What I really love about this place?  The races!  While I don't gamble, it's rare to go to a clean, classy place and see races.   The menu is vast.  I like the hummus platter:  surrounded by slices of cucumber and other fresh veggies.  The hummus has a bit of a kick, which is how I make it when I actually have the time. My servers are always super-friendly and have an awesome sense of humor! Service is quick, too!

Tonight, I had a chance to show a brutha some culture.  When someone is taking me to dinner, I pick a place that I *know* is going to be a winner.  Rokerij didn't disappoint!  The parking lot was full, so I started to get scared that we wouldn't be able to get a table or have to *gasp* wait for one. At first, we had gone downstairs to eat there, but it was packed, so we headed to the restaurant.  From previous reviews, I was afraid it would be packed and we would have to find somewhere else to go eat.  I really wanted to impress the guy (HA even though he was buying!) and, luckily, there were a few empty tables upstairs. We were seated at the far end in a corner booth.  Any restaurants with booths get an A+ in my book.  I love sitting close to friends and a booth gives the perfect opportunity. Specials were neatly written on blackboards, but I was at a weird angle to read them.  Chris, our waiter, read them for us and explained each dish.  That was the high point of his service the rest of the night. As we perused the menu, our drink order was taken.  I really wanted to get the small plates and try a few different things, so we both chose 3 each.  I got the crab tostadas.  They were filled to the brim with crab, not too much dressing so the crab flavor wasn't drowned.  I also got the bacon-wrapped grilled shrimp (YUMMY!!!!) and the brie toasts.  Divine!  The cheese was melted perfectly, with just enough of its grease to soak into the bread.  I actually licked my fingers after each one. He got the skewered steak, shrimp on dirty rice and meat tacos.  The rice wasn't all that, but the rest of the dishes were superb! As we ate, and our drinks emptied, we had to call Chris over to get refills.  Not once had he checked on us during the meal.  It's the reason for 4 stars!  I was a bit disappointed in that.  For such a Valley favorite, I had hoped for a little more attention. Ambiance is key at Rokerij.  The smell of the wood-burning fireplace, the cozy booth and warm atmosphere gave me cause to want to go back again.  And, the brutha liked, it too!

Funk.  It's the first thing that comes to mind.  They just moved the salon farther down the plaza and the new salon is AMAZING! Each room is decorated differently with vintage clocks, lights and wall hangings.  Vintage wall paper.  HUGE mirrors (even too big for me to stare at myself in!) and...well, it's just plain ole funky!   The reception area has HUGE yellow thrones.   I love walking into this place! Got my eyebrows done by Ginger.  She's a roller derby grrl, so I just told her to do what she wantes (so I wouldn't get hurt).  Also recommended an awesome brow powder which, I must admit, makes my eyes "pop". Full-service salon - skin and hair. You gotta go.  Tell 'em Amy sent ya!  You will be awed by the decor!

Seriously, I can't understand why anyone would go anywhere else!  Got my eyebrows done by Miss Ginger Mortis (yeah, she's a roller derby chick!) and the most fabulous cut EVER from Ethan.  It's one of those places where, when you walk in, you get this funky vibe.  I feel hip going there.  I never use the word "hip."  Today, though, I have to! When summer comes, it's time for a new 'do.  I have confidence in my stylist and just say "do something fun" and Ethan pulled through.  It's also nice to see a place where everyone is happy to be working there.  Go.  Just go.  Now.

Serious mochi craving that wasn't quenched at AJ's, so, off to TJ's!  They have an amazing produce section, with imported fruits you may not find at your regular grocery store.  Cheeses from everywhere! I like the white cheese puffs, TJ's brand, to snack on.  I also like that they have cookies from everywhere.  I had a butter cookie craving along with the mochi craving and found everything here. Hummus?  Arik would be happy to know there are several flavors to choose from. It smells like Nag Champa.  Hippies man the cash registers.  Paper bags!  My cat loves playing in them. Many organic products to choose from, too. I feel good when I shop here.

This was the first time I'd been to Wrigley Mansion while it was open.  I had a "private tour" by an employee once and got to see everything and it really is a great place. Went for a birthday party and we had dinner.  $5 for valet parking, which is really reasonable, I think.  Especially in heels, cuz this girl ain't walkin' up them thar stairs.   We had a private dining room, about 25 or so of us.  Wait staff did an awesome job dealing with such a huge party and handling our bill. If it weren't for the food and price, I would have given this place 5 stars.  I started with the leek tart, which was amazing and a great portion size for an appetizer. Next, had the Tuna Nicoise salad.  This is where they lose a star, and it wasn't just me voicing a problem with the size of the portion.  There was definitely plenty of tuna on it, but as Erin said "You'd think they would have put more of the cheap stuff on it" meaning there wasn't a whole lot of salad.  And the roasted potatoes that came with it?  I had two cubes of HARD potatoes.  They were barely cooked.  The tuna was perfectly seared on the outside and still nicely red on the inside.  If it weren't for that, I would have been horribly disappointed.  $43 for an appetizer, a salad and a bottle of Pellegrino.  (That included the gratuity added for such a large group).   Wrigley is all about the ambiance and view, and it surpasses what you could describe it to be.  Seeing the city at night and being surrounded by cool peeps is what really made the place!

Dexter woke me up on Sunday at 5:30 am. Now, that may not seem like a big deal, but this dog LOVES bedtime and gets extremely lazy once he snuggles under the covers. I knew something was up. Diarrhea. Ugh. Puking. Ugh. I waited 2 days, then decided it was time to take him in to be checked out. The staff was pleasant on the phone and made sure to let me know I'd have to arrive 15 minutes early to fill out paperwork. They checked me in right away and I got to work. The room opened up quickly, so I finished my paperwork in there. Twice an assistant came in to check on Dexter and ask some basic questions. The vet, Dr. Bishop, was very personable. He set my mind at ease right away. As he finished he said "He's a very good dog." Aw!! I know this, and my friends know this, but I like everyone knowing what a great dog he is. He got a shot, some meds to bring home, and cans of food for the next few days. The entire office visit was just over $100. After some of the other places I've been, this was a welcome relief. It looks like the ghetto from outside, but don't be alarmed. Everyone there was great. I'm already taking him back next week for his yearly shots.

I've had every carrier you can think of (except, of course, Cricket).  The customer service at T-Mobile is awesome!  I *had* to have the RAZR two years ago.  Ugh.  It was the worst phone ever.  Wasn't T-Mobile's fault, just Motorola.  Anyway, visited the store twice and had to get replacement phones.  Each time, they exchanged the phone for free. Even now when I have troubles, I go in and everyone is friendly and helpful.   I'm still with them for another couple years (I keep needing new phones!) and wouldn't change providers for anything right now.

My name is Amy and I'm a comedian.  ("Hi, AMY!")  I perform here about once a month and it's one of my favorite spots to make people laugh. This is a bar.  Behind an ice rink.  The wall behind the bar is the plexiglass of the ice rink.  One time, while I was on stage, a puck hit the glass.  Freaked me the you-know-what out.  I thought I'd been shot.  But I hadn't.  Lucky for you. I don't drink, so I have no idea about specials, what's on tap, blah blah blah. I can tell you this:  The service is amazing (and CUTE!) and the place is clean.  I judge.  I judge you on your bathroom.  This bathroom is clean.   The comedy show is every Wednesday night.  It's free.  If you're lucky, you'll see me there.  Making people laugh.

We had a coupon at work - buy one 6", get one free.  Believe it or not, 6" is plenty for this lil girl! ;} I got the #5 sandwich, which was turkey with cheese and cranberry.  There are two different breads to choose from and two different dressings.  I had the whole wheat bread and the garlic dressing.  They have the sandwich menu split into regions of the world, which I thought was cute, though then the number selection of the sandwiches was off.  It affected my OCD, but not too much! This was one of the best sandwiches I've had in this area!  I'm in the Scottsdale Airpark and surrounded by restaurants.  Most are just trendy places that people go to, just to say they've been there.  And they suck, for the most part! So, the sandwich was ooey-gooey and delish!  I had sauce running down my arm and cheese sliding out the sides.  That's how we do it on the East Coast, yo!  Oh, and a cranberry popped out onto my "shelf" (the chest, dudes!) but didn't stain, luckily.  5-second rule, right? Anyway, with the coupon, my co-worker and I paid $3 for 6"!!!

Dexter just graduated from puppy school today.  We've been going for 8 weeks and Lauren, the trainer, was awesome!  Even when Dexter piddled, she didn't get pissed.  Of course, he was the most adorable puppy in class...Ok, most of the time he was the ONLY one in class, but, still... The first few weeks, we were given bags of treats to take home and use for homework.  Yes, homework.  After each class, I was given a hand-out of that week's class to use at home. The class cost $109 for 8 weeks and was sooooo worth it!  Not only do I have THE most adorable puppy in the entire universe, but he's also the smartest.  He's a store favorite.  All the employees learned his name!  Of course, he's a lot like Mommy and went up to anyone looking for some lovin'.  Er...*I* don't do that, but you know what I mean. I've heard about other PetSmart's training classes.  This one didn't live up to the horror stories! He'll be going for intermediate classes in the fall.  I guess that's like Middle School.  For dogs.

I don't eat here, but I get take out every couple of months. I love the pizzeria salad, or whatever it's called.  I ALWAYS bring home a slice of the red velvet cake, too. It turns my poop red, so I know it's the real deal. This place is always busy, so you can't be an impatient Nancypants when you go.  While you are waiting, you can do some shopping and find some cool specialty foods.

When I have a hankerin' for a new Thai place, I contact Chris T.  He recommended Thai Lahna and I am a bit perturbed that it's so close to my house.  You see, I go pretty often.  Like twice a month.   I always get the #35, which is a peanut dish in a brown sauce.  It's orgasmic.  Seriously.  It comes with chicken, but you can substitute tofu, which is key in my book.   Staff is very friendly, though I almost always get take-out.  I drool as I drive home with my bag neatly closed, smelling it down Indian School.

When my boss orders us supervisors lunch, he always gets Spinato's!  I'm more excited about having it than I am having him pay for it! I love the square pieces and thin crust. And, yes, there is just something about the sauce!

Having had the WORST December in my entire LIFE (cancer scare, cat put to sleep, staph infection.  Ugh!) I really needed a good way to get rid of 2007.  Yoga Pura provided the perfect opportunity to do so:  a New Year's Eve meditation.  It started at 9pm and went till the clock struck 12 and 2007 was finally OVER!  Took my intern, Tondra, and had the best New Year's Eve ever! Yoga Pura has a few different rooms for yoga, workshops and classes.  I've done the Power Yoga several times along with workshops.  Everyone is very welcoming there as soon as you walk in the door. Upon entering, there's the obligartory scent of Nag Champa, and their retail store.  They have the cutest yoga mat bags!  There are also racks of yoga clothes and different objects to decorate your house with.  A few years ago, I bought some really cool wall hangings from India.  Prices are reasonable for a private boutique. If you are going to take a class, they have a little cubby for your shoes before entering each studio.  SO much better than most yoga studios that just have a doormat with a pile of everyone's shoes. The New Year's meditation workshop was run by Jesus - I mean Yogi E.  Tondra and I couldn't help but giggle a few times during class, even though we weren't supposed to utter a sound or ever open our eyes.  OH!  During one of the several different meditations that evening, some lady started rubbing some sort of lotion on my feet.  Not sure what that was all about.   Yoga Pura also offers classes for getting certified as a yoga instructor.   If you ever need to relax, try a GREAT way to stay fit or just burn off some steam, go to Yoga Pura!  They rock!  (without making too much noise!)

I've been going to this Jiffy Lube location since I moved here almost 6 years ago.  I drive from my current home in Downtown Phoenix to go there! I have a rare car.  Nobody ever has the right tool to take the oil filter out, except for this location.  I've tried other Jiffy Lubes and they've had to order the tool. Yesterday, I went for my quarterly oil change.  They didn't have the proper filter.  They gave me the choice of either going back in a few hours or staying put.  None of the auto parts stores had it.  Only the VW dealership in North Scottsdale.  I stayed put, and one of the service techs drove to the dealership, picked up the part AND called me when he was on his way back.  Hey, I was out of the office for this and another half hour from work on a Friday wasn't gonna kill me! They threw in free wiper blades to make up for my wait.  Changed all my filters - air, A/C AND, of course, the oil. ULTRA-friendly staff, service was excellent.  They normally vacuum my car, but I told them to skip it since I had to detail my car the next day anyway.  "Are you sure, Amy?" They knew my name, used it often during my visit, and didn't treat me like a bimbo for being a woman in an auto car place.

I cannot believe I haven't reviewed Brigett's yet! I've been performing here for about a year. There is a free comedy show every Tuesday night at 8. The service is always great, and Shanna always has my regular drink (soda water with lime) on my table before I even get settled. It's a biker bar. Sometimes, the regulars aren't into comedy, but that rarely happens. When it does, though, it usually makes for a pretty raucous night! Comedians have big mouths and with a mic in hand, there's no stopping us, no matter how big your Harley is! The food is decent for a dive bar. I always get a cheeseburger with bacon. Nothing fancy, but it hits the spot. If you go on Tuesday nights, the tacos are all $1.50 and I can usually only eat one. Sound system is great! If you stay after the comedy show, there's karaoke. Well, the karaoke is every night, but why would you go without a great comedy show? Friendly staff, clean bathrooms (I almost always talk about bathrooms in my reviews. I pee a lot.), decent bar food and always characters to look at.  Oh, one time there was this creepy dude that kept coming up and standing behind me, as if he wanted to talk to me, but he didn't even attempt a conversation. Apparently, he's gotten kicked out of there before for harassing females. These are the guys I attract.

I can't believe nobody has reviewed this place!  It's been a local music establishment forever! Joe Grotto (hence, the name) is a staple in the music scene here.  He's the nicest guy, too! There is a big floor in front of the stage to get up close to the bands.  Behind that are rows of tables for just watching.  To me, it's a bit random to have the tables, but it seems to work for Joe's! My guy friends like the hot waitresses.

This is where I pick up my Bountiful Basket occasionally.  While the food for the co-op is already packaged up for the pick-up, they also have other offerings available at great prices! There is ample parking and super friendly staff.  I've even had people help me out with my bounty.

This is about the ONLY reason I miss my old job: it was right around the corner from "The Farm". The first time I went, I thought it was so peaceful to be in a city!  I love the outdoor picnic tables and their potato salad is to die for!   It reminds me of my small town back East.  Friendly, open-air, with good, homemade food.

I seriously can't wait to take my parents here!!!  After the OYE, I called Mom to tell her about the slide.  The one that I didn't really make it down very well because my legs were sticky from the walk up the driveway.  Well, I got a ride, but it was still hot out.  I know.  Gross.  Whatever. The service here is suuuuuuuper friendly!  Everyone was really nice and seemed to be enjoying their jobs. The food I would say was OK.  Great variety, though not overly original.  Options for vegetarians, too. I'll definitely be back a LOT.  My stepdad is gonna love this place!!

I ended up here after checking my Yelp app during a doctor's appointment in the area. I am SO GLAD I found it! I love ethnic grocery stores. I can get sucked in and explore for hours. They had a lot of Middle Eastern foods, with American items in the mix, too.  The staff is great! I was greeted as soon as I walked in.  I got the beef gyro plate, which came with your choice of 3 sides. I got the hummus, baba ghanoush, and tabbouleh. They also offer fries, but why the heck would I get fries at a Mediterranean deli? Crazy talk! The meat was sliced thinly, super tender, and had the right amount of grease. Hey, if you're gonna eat meat, you gotta have some grease, right? RIGHT? The sides were great, too. They were drizzled with olive oil, which always tells me I'm at a place that knows how to make the food they are advertising. I have the leftovers in the fridge, and can't wait to eat it! I will definitely be back. Again. And again. And again.

I kind of feel like a jerk for taking YEARS to get to Liberty. I've been following Joe on Twitter for about 5 years. We have a lot of mutual friends, and I bumped into him at a wedding. I knew it was him because of the hat.  I live in CenPho, so Gilbert is like a day trip to the country for me. But, my boyfriend lives there, so I am finally going to places I've been hearing about forever. I love Liberty Market!  I had a burger with horseradish that was that day's special. My boyfriend had the Cuban. We both loved our food! The potato chips were homemade, which is pretty much the coolest thing ever.  The staff looks happy to work here. The place was PACKED, but the tables emptied and got filled right away. They seem to have a good system down for times that are busy like these. I even saw two people I know there, so that tells you what kind of place you're at. I can't wait to go again!

So, after the assplosion, I think I'd better write my review! Sucked as soon as we walked in.  Party of 5.  Approximately 1pm.  Not busy.  2 four-top and one 2-top tables empty, plus the sushi bar.  They said it would be a 20-minute wait for us to get a bigger table.  We suggested just taking a 4-top.  Ended up that the co-owner of my company pushed two tables together and Voila!  We were seated.   Drink order got taken quickly.  Our waitress, Sarah, hated us from moment one.  Got our drinks, placed our orders.  I've never waited so long for sushi! I had the tempura box lunch special, and everyone got a bunch of sushi dishes to taste.  One girl is allergic to gluten, so ordered hers wrapped in soy paper.  It came wrapped in rice.  The waitress also claimed that they don't wrap their sushi in cucumber.  Huh?  I've never been anywhere that DOESN'T wrap in cucumber instead of rice.  Luckily, we took the plate to the sushi chef and he re-did it with the soy paper.  It was a WAY smaller serving than the original. She was great about refilling our drinks, but just wasn't as friendly (meaning not at ALL) as any other server I've ever had. This place sucks ball and I won't be back. Now, Back to the assplosion...

BEAUTIFUL salon!  The receptionists were really nice and I chatted with them while waiting for Jayme, my aesthetician, to come up front. It's not too big, not too small.  The decor is sleek and "clean."  It wasn't really loud, which, as a beauty consultant, I find overwhelming if the music is too loud. Jayme was great with my "caterpillars" and even did a different shape, based on my face/eye shape. Super professional! Brow wax was $15.  I gave a $5 tip, too.

Went here after my gig at The Sets, just across the street.  My intern works here and I figured I'd bring a bunch of peeps and help the kid make money since I don't pay him.  (INTERN, get it?) Anyway, it was a pretty cool crowd.  Lil bit o' everythin'.  Tattooed, punk, prep, Scottsdale-ish girls.   The juke was awesome. Plenty of pool tables. Great drink specials (hey, I have "connections" and got 2 - for - 1 cards for my friends!) and friendly staff.  Sort of.  There was a girl working the bar who said, pretty loudly, to MY intern: "I can handle the bar myself tonight."  Then she asked for his help once it started filling up.  What a bitch but whatever! I'll definitely go back.  It had a cool vibe!

Ok.  I'm from Buffalo.  I spent many, many drunken teenage nights at Ted's!  I was ECSTATIC to find one right here in the Valley! Sahlen's hot dogs...my mouth waters thinking about them!  They are REAL dogs, with the skin still at the ends.   When you go, ask for Weber's mustard instead of crappy French's.  Weber's is a small factory in Western NY that still does everything by hand.  It's a horseradish mustard and the best! Their onion rings are dunked and fried right in front of your eyes.  Not too much batter, and you can actually taste the onion. Expect a line.  Anytime, day or night, it's packed!  THAT is how good this place is! I love going, just to read the walls while waiting in line.   It takes me back home to Buffalo.  A place I will never in my life go visit again, but at least I can eat the food I grew up with!

I just had my first trip to the Wildlife World Zoo.  It was great!  I like that it's dirt, makes it seem more genuine than the Phoenix Zoo.  The map was easy to read and I got to skip over what I really wasn't interested it.  I'm not big on birds :P I also got to feed the giraffes!  Gross!  But, cool!   There are animals you won't see anywhere else:  the albino alligator, which was my reason for going there in the first place.  You won't get to get as close to a rhino as here.   It's also less commercial than other zoos: no plastic lids or straws, not inundated with vending There are even a train ride and sky ride! I went with a 4-yr old.  I was exhausted and needed a nap.  Not sure if it was because there was so much to see, or that I went with a kid.  I'm not around kids very often!

I have to agree with everyone.  The menu is extensive, which is a good thing.  No matter who you go with, you'll all find something you like. BUT I hate the atmosphere.  I hate the crowd.  I hate the NOISE!  I feel like part of a herd of cattle there. They have one salad I like.  It's got walnuts, pears and a good raspberry vinaigrette.   The cheesecake?  Well, being from NY, I find it mediocre.   I got a gift card for CF last year for my birthday.  I re-gifted it.

Ok, so I had written a review of our Yelp birthday party, but not of the museum itself. Just got back from the "Selected Shorts" exhibit:  short films.  After having lunch in Arcadia Farms, a group of 12 of us headed to the film festival (No Festival Required).  Seven shorts, all very different.  And the exhibit was FREE!!!  We didn't even have to pay to get into the museum, since we were having lunch.   Entering the theater was really cool!  Stadium seating, which I hadn't expected.  When you're a shorty like me, stadium seating is a must unless you want to deal with a crink in yer neck.  There was a stage with the screen above it, so even the people in front would have a good view without said crink.  No popcorn, but the seats were comfy.  Staff was really friendly and it started and ended when they said it would!  *gasp* Definitely going to be back to the museum and most definitely going to catch screenings in the theater.

I love the Paper Heart! I've performed there as a comic, promoted all different sorts of bands there, and seen performance artists there. The Paper Heart also has great artwork, which is always changing. The bathrooms are super-cool!  There's a lever on the counter to turn the water off and on. I don't drink, but there seems to be a GREAT selection of beers and wines!

I'm pullin' an Al Bundy on the couch after dining at LoLo's.  You know - he sits on the couch, slouched with his hand down the front of his pants to give more room to his gut.  That's me right now, only with WAY better hair. Had the #10.  Because I'm a 10, get it?  Two chicken legs with a waffle.  I went with Julia T., Jason W., Nathan S., Amanda B., and David SB tonight.  We all ordered different sides so we could share.  Our end of the table shared the collard greens , mac and cheese and candied sweet potatoes. The platter of chicken and waffles arrived.  You should see the scoop of butter on the waffle!  A scoop!  Not a pat!  The chicken legs were perfectly done - moist, not greasy, with an awesome coating that wasn't too much.  The waffle was perfectly crisp on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.  I'm glad it came with syrup, not maple syrup.  I detest maple anything.  I lived in New England too long. Nathan leaned over and suggested we pretend we were making an Ice Cube movie, Babershop-style, and pick an actor to play each of us.  I was Angela Bassett, of course.   Collard green were yummy!  Not over-cooked, with hunks of the stems thrown in.  The sweet potatoes were pretty sweet, but not overly so.  Mac and cheese?  Yes, please! (that rhymed!)  And the tea.  Ohhhhhh the tea.  I got the half and half sweet.  I figured there was enough sugar in my meal that I didn't want to bounce off the walls and crash like a 4-year old after Halloween.  I had two huge glasses - actually, jars.  It's served in Kerr canning jars.  The big ones.  It was so good (How good was it???) that as I got up from my corner seat and walked around to leave, I reached over to take one last huge swig.   I'm full.  Not Thanksgiving-dinner full, but properly sated after a meal at LoLo's.   The company rocked and I couldn't have asked for a more pleasant dinner crowd!   (p.s. We pegged Whoopie to play Julia.  Ha!)

I happen to LOVE the Bikini!  Went here the other night after my gig.  It was pretty empty (Wednesday night) UNTIL 11:30 when the place got a crowd.  I was wondering "Who the heck goes out this late on a Wednesday night?" You know it's becoming something more popular when the parking lot is filled with Audis and Beemers.   The bartender lady was a peach!   I like the high-top tables.  Kind of retro-metal and they were clean.  You'd notice if they were dirty because of the sheen.  The booth we were in was HUGE and really comfy.   The jukebox is pretty good, though they didn't have the Pantera I was looking for.  I don't think that's a Bikini fault, though. I like the mixed crowd.  It reminds me of the old Jugheads.  All walks of life and really nice people to talk to.  When I can go up to a stranger at a bar and shoot the shit for a moment, it's a cool place. Yeah, it may be a little stinky, but it's a DIVE BAR.

Not in a burger mood, I went for the fish n chips. Hello, rubbery batter! *pfffffft* (that's how you spell the sound a fart makes.) Fries were yummy.  Ordering process was organized. *ppffffffffffffttttttttttt* I like the different varieties of tea.  I don't like mine sweetened. Good lunch hour crowd.  Lots of men. *ppppffffftttttt*

A creep-factor prerequisite must be "names that being with the letter 'A'" and boy, they're in abundance! Char's for Amanda's birthday was awesome!  Went with Amandra, Nathan, Kevin and Dottsy.  It was awesome to be able to walk to a place instead of driving to the other side of the Valley! This place has *the* most courteous people working there.  As it turned out, when I went to the bar to get a drink, I knew the owner.  He had a pizza place right next to my house.  It closed down and I haven't had decent pizza since! This was a mixed crowd, which always gives an extra star.  I was afraid to be the only cracker there, but noooooo.  There was "white boy in gym shorts" trying to dance with us.  Creepy Anthony (starts with an A!) rubbin' on me as I was sitting at a table.  Oh and asking me "If you're single, how do you sexually stimulate yourself?"  WTF??  Is this a new pick-up line I hadn't been told about??? Drinks were priced fairly and strong (or so I'm guessing by everyone around me) and service was quick and super-friendly. $6 cover charge is more than reasonable to see an awesome cover band (which I usually hate) and actually get my white ass on the dance floor.  Yes.  Me.  Dancing.  I did the Brady Bunch thumb thing.  Or was it more like Elaine?  Whichever, I had a blast! This is a place that I will go to regularly.  I felt comfortable there, despite Creepy Guy Rubbin' On Me.

Cheese crisp!!!  This place is *right* across the street and I've only been a few times.  Tonight, I needed something fast, close and naughty!  So, I remembered someone recommending the cheese crisp. The tortilla was super-crispy and LOADED...LOADED...LOADED with cheese!  I also got the green chile strips on it.  They were huge strips and cut the greasy cheese just right.  Side of awesome guac - had a little kick to it!  The place itself isn't fancy at ALL.  There are a few different rooms to dine in.  Service was really friendly - all young boys.  Woohoo!

Picture this:  Girl hasn't had a spot of sugar in two months.  Former NFL running back invites said girl for ice cream.  What better place than Mary Coyle? As soon as we walked in (FIRST DATE), we got a corner booth.  Service was super-friendly.  Knowing I was having my first sugar rush in FOREVAH, I immediately said "Anything with peanut butter" to the girl.  Hey, if I am going against the grain with my strange eating habits, I'm goin' all out.  Besides, the bruthas love a lil meat on the bones, right? Got our water with HUGE lemon slices right away and ice cream wasn't far behind. OK the company gave it the last star.  Wait.  I would give it 6 stars because the place is worth 5 but the guy made it 6.  Got it?  Good. Pretty busy for 8:30 on a Wednesday night.  Mixed crowd.  Every time another table got served, we both said "Dang, we got cheated" because everything looked so good! I've been a few times and have enjoyed it every time! Go.  Forget Cold Stone.  Go to Mary Coyle. Just don't flirt with the football player and you won't get hurt, OK?

Definitely go on Wednesdays for the $6 steak dinner!  We used to run comedy here on the same night.  I would show up early for the dinner, then go perform. For the price, the steak is awesome!  It was thick, tender and juicy.  The sides could be a bit larger, though, as they were equally delicious.

I am so glad I found this place, and it's right across the street! It's in Melrose, the quaint neighborhood on 7th Avenue between Indian School & Camelback. Now, for the review: My 15-year old cat, Spike, got sick.  I got an appointment the same day. They were so caring there.  I got into a private room almost upon arrival and didn't wait long for the vet.  It was bad news:  his kidneys had failed.  They ran tests and I knew...KNEW...I would have to put him to sleep.  I had been preparing for this day.  The female vet put her hand on my shoulder, which is exactly what I needed. The vet loaded him up with fluids so I could have a few days with my Spike.  Turns out, the next day, he wasn't doing any better.  I immediately went back, tears streaming down my face.  I whispered "I need to put him down".  They immediately whisked me to a private room.  Everything was humane and the people working there were so caring!  They let me sit with him after he died and said they'd be back in a bit.  I was a wreck, but everyone came in and hugged me. I wasn't charged an arm and a leg.  I had him cremated and they gave me a beautiful urn to go with Spike. I highly recommend Alta Vista based on service, price, caring and the wide range of services they offer. They also do day care and boarding!

After having such a wonderful experience here with my cat a couple of years ago, I was incredibly disappointed with the treatment we got last April when my border collie, Queen, got sick. They found a mass bigger than a grapefruit on her spleen.  She was so lethargic, I couldn't walk her around the block.  That was so unusual for her, especially with her breed.  This was a dog I could take on 10-hour hikes in the White Tanks and she'd still be ready for more. I was told I could have her go through surgery and that if it wasn't cancer, she could have a year more to live.  Keep in mind, Queen was 12.  Ripe age for a very active dog.  If it was cancer (it would take two weeks to find out), she could go through chemo and have another 6 months to live. I didn't feel that surgery or chemo were something that a) would give her the quality of life she had lived thus far b) was something I could afford or c) the best decision for her health. I took her home (it was a Friday night) and decided to have her put to sleep the next day.  When I got up Saturday morning to let them know I would be in, it took about 10 minutes for them to call me back.  In fact, it was the actual vet calling, trying to talk me out of the humane treatment for Queen, and trying to talk me into spending time, money and emotional stress on my dog, just to have her for another year.  Selfish.  I couldn't bear to have her sick at ALL any longer.  He pushed a little more, and I informed him I would be in as soon as my Mom arrived from Payson to go through it all with me. I felt like the care they were giving was more financially-based than humane.   I'll never take any of my animals here again.

I go here every morning on my way to work. Everyone knows my name.  I am like "Norm" on Cheers.   Coffee is always fresh and there are a TON of different drinks to choose from. It's super-clean, too! Staff is ultra-friendly. I love Quik Trip! Cheaper gas than most places, too.

Ok I am a bit scared to be the first to review this store!  Despite it's location, it's really cool inside. Tastefully decorated with the "safe stuff" at the door...lingerie!  I have about a half dozen different teddies and tons of panties from here.  Some of it is so cute!  Of course, there's the cheesy stuff, but you KNOW someone is gonna buy it! There's a great collection of fetish gear, too, including boots and shoes. They have the TOYS set up towards the back, a bit hidden for those who might be a bit shy to check them out. Cashier was helpful...and so was the security guard behind her!  Teehee! Always a sale, too!

This place is WAY bigger than it appears from outside!  I needed lemongrass and kaffir lime leaves for hot & sour soup.  I got that.  Along with baby bok choy, curry paste, Piknik snacks and a couple of other things. Produce aisle isn't all labeled, so I had to ask for help.  They didn't have the lime leaves out.  The little man found me in another part of the store with a package of them.   There are aisles and aisles of all sorts of Oriental foods.  I could have spent a couple of hours in there exploring, but wasn't feeling so hot.  That's why I wanted to make the soup in the first place. Strange odor near produce section, but I don't question those sorts of things.   Spent $10 and walked out with a big bag o' stuff.

I wish I had talked Zoe into Siu Wok... Ugh.  Ok, this place is cheap.  That's always a plus.  We wanted take-out from the buffet.  You get a card (kinda like at Chino Bandito) and mark what you want from the buffet.  Hostess takes card to the buffet and fills your take-out box.  Ok, here is where she actually GETS stars.  My box was full.  Overloaded.  Always a plus, as Chinese take-out is always good the next day.  Lo Mein, sesame chicken, egg roll (she gave me 2!), beef with broccoli, some shrimp thing and BBQ pork ribs.   8.18 with tax for what has turned out (so far) to be 4 meals.  There is a complete lack of flavor for most of the dishes.  The only one that actually HAD flavor was the ribs.  The rest?  MEH.  I never use "meh," but in this case, it works. There was only one packet of soy sauce in the bag.  No sweet and sour for my egg rolls.  The lo mein?  No flavor.  Shrimp thing?  Actually had shrimp in it, but, still, no flavor. I'm a bit pissed, because I had a real craving for Chinese food.  What I really got was Grandma making Chinese that Gramps could eat without feeling it the next day. Me, I'm not feeling this place at ALL.   The only thing that got them stars was the size of the take-out portion and the price.   MEH.

I suck at taking care of my nails. For me, it's better to just pay someone else to do it. I had never tried gels before, but DeAnna suggested it for my toes.  It lasted forever! I didn't have to remove it until it just grew out too much to just cover it up.  The place is super clean! There are a couple hair stylists, too, but sometimes it's just me and DeAnna. I'm ok with that. :)   *TIP: I have to book a month in advance, and I'm a regular! So, I book my next appointment every time I go.

Got invited here for HH and dinner. When the fish n chips special is walleye...well, you just can't say no!  The fish fry was awesome!  I haven't had walleye since my father died, and his birthday is coming up, so it was a great tribute. 5 generous pieces of fish came with super-crispy fries, tartar sauce as well as cocktail sauce, a side of coleslaw and...malt vinegar with the condiments!   Four Peaks got it right.  Though the fish was a bit greasy on the outside, it was really tasty and fried perfectly.  There was not too much batter, so I could actually taste the fish.  Having the malt vinegar to douse the fries with gets major cool points.  Add a few dashes of salt and...mmmmyummy! The coleslaw was, eh, nothing major.   Really random crowd with many different types of people made me not cringe so much that I had been invited there.  I avoid the ASU crowd like the plague.   It was a bit loud to have a decent conversation, but it *was* Friday. Oh, and I got a parking spot right out front.  How can you beat THAT???????????

The weekend shows suck me in! Car Talk was one of the only things my father and I had in common. Ira Glass?  My secret radio crush :} Splendid Table?  Love it! Fresh Air?  Awesome! I love NPR!  I even have my friends back East tune in online on Sunday nights for the blues

Don't tell anyone back East that I had a Chicago-style pizza last night!  I'll lose a pinky or end up buried in the Meadowlands. What I like about Oregano's is the freshness.  We ordered the deep-dish, Chicago-style pizza and they warned us that it would take 45 minutes.  Hey, fine with me.  So, to bide the time, we got cheesy bread.  This thing was about 2 feet long!  It came out in a bread basket, but was hanging over the ends.  That's how long it was.  Hey, I'm single.  I pay attention to length. There are a million different ingredients you can put on your pizza.  We had mushrooms (you can choose regular or portabella), onions (white, carmelized or red), green peppers and jalapenos.  It came out loaded with cheese and topped with sauce.  I like that.  It made the veggies and cheese all melted together and then topped with sauce.  I could only have one piece.   I didn't stay for the pazookie.  One of these days, I will.   The service was excellent.  We had a table outside (it had stopped raining) near the heaters.  The manager even gave me a blankie to put on my lap.

I'm writing this 9 hours after leaving and boooooooy oh booooooooy are my arms sore!  And my fingertips.  And my chest.  And my legs. I had the Deal Chicken coupon and took a girl from work.  I had no idea what to wear.  I had no idea how to wear my hair, expecting a helmet.  So, I didn't do much to it after rolling out of bed. I wish I had, because the place was full of cute guys! They're really into making sure you have the safest time while you're there.  You sign a wavier, with an emergency contact.  (YIKES!!!! Haha!)  You watch a video about safety and how-to.  Then, you're guided by an instructor and have to do a few climbs with them present.  Mine was a hottie named Robert.  Ohhhhhh Robert.  Super-friendly, cracking more jokes than I was, which rarely happens.  He showed us the ropes (get it?  Ropes?  You're harnessed into ROPES!  I kill me!) and then showed us around to walls better for beginners. The place is pretty big.  They mark different climbing trails with a difficulty level, and keep them color-coded.  We tried three different walls.  We had to move from one area because these two cute guys kept talking to us and I didn't want my ass sticking out from the wall, in their faces, while trying to concentrate on not slipping and dying in front of them.   It was fun, we stayed a little over 2 hours.  I'm pretty sore, but I was wise and made an appointment for a massage for tomorrow. Oh, and I'll know better next time and make sure my hair is done perfectly.  They told me most of the single guys are there on Tuesday and Thursday nights.  If you see me there then, hide.  You're not my competition and I'll cut your safety rope.

Get there early for dinner and you won't be disappointed!  They have a really great appetizer selection. I actually like sitting in the balcony.  I'm a shortie (5 feet tall) and sometimes have difficulty seeing the stage when I set downstairs. I'm a bit partial, since it was my first stage, but the management and staff are awesome! Check out their website.  Sometimes, they have locals perform on Sundays with the weekend headliner doing a guest spot.  It's cheaper! And don't forget:  When Jerry Seinfeld decided to return to comedy, he picked the Tempe Improv to be his first show!  It's the comics' favorite place to perform!

I was just here a few weeks ago.  The place is decorated very urban/retro.  I love the car doors lining the south wall!   Service was super-friendly.  I would have given 5 stars except for one thing: THEY HAD NO VEGGIES THE DAY I WAS THERE!.  That's right!  I even said to our waitperson :How can a vegan restaurant have no vegetables??????   I got peanut noodles and it was still ver good, despite the lack of veggies. I will go back, though, fo sho'!

It's hard being a NYer and trying to find decent pizza up in here.   Had a date tonight.  He's fairly new to the area and lives in *gasp* Gilbert.  So, we picked something in the middle.  I suggested Mill Ave, because at least we could mock people as we wandered around. It was chaos.  Did all the douchebags leave Scottsdale for the night?  The answer is...YES. So, we wanted something to eat and both agreed on pizza.  This was street food, as we wanted to walk around some more.  Saw the slices that people were eating and we both said "Now THAT'S a NY pizza slice! Cheap, fast and fun service.  The place was packed because of some football game going on.  Whatever. All I know, is that you're supposed to have a slice of pizza that you have to fold in half to eat so the grease drips down your elbow.  Slices came through.

I love the tiki! It's super-cool to see art for sale by people you know. AWESOME T-shirt collection! I don't like the parking lot.  One-way. The people who work here rock!  Miss Amy makes cupcakes for their events.  She's cool.

Sure.  AFTER I move from Melrose, one of my favorite stores moves there.   I needed a new T-shirt and, of course, wanted something different.  Their new location feels roomier than the old one on 7th Street.  A cute calico cat greeted me at the door and followed me to the shirt rack. Their selection of girl t-shirts was small, which is why I took a star away.  But, other than that, they still have all the funky shiznit you'd expect!  I was on my lunch break, so in a hurry, didn't have much time to browse.  I'll be back this weekend to buy Xmas presents.  For mySELF! ;}

Being a Yelper, I have anticipated my visit to Pizzeria Bianco for over a year.  I finally got the opportunity to go to night!  Fellow Yelper from Houston, Ryan, was in town for work again and invited me out.  We met up at the wine bar next door and got a cheese plate.  Three different kinds of cheese, all really good and tangy!  The thin bread the came with was a bit too crunchy to eat with cheese on it, but tasty nonetheless.  Finally, after a two hour wait, we were called! We're in!  I'm going to Pizzeria Bianco!!!! We had a really nice waiter.  He was there when we needed, didn't hover at all.  We started with a couple appetizers.  I had a prosciutto-wrapped melted cheese on a skewer.  There is nothing better in this world than melted cheese!  The skewers were served on a bed of "micro-arugula" and drizzled with olive oil.  Soooooooooooooo yummy!   We ordered two pizzas to share: The Wiseguy and the Biancoverde.  The Wiseguy had sausage and caramelized onions on it.  Really good!  The Biancoverde, though, was even better.  Three different cheese and again, the micro-arugula.  I'm not a crust person.  I ate the parts with the toppings, but not the edged.  I never do.  The crust was thin and had soaked up some of the natural grease that comes with melted cheese.  Definitely got a wet spot from it!   I'm full.  I'm exhausted.  I had had a strange and mildly crappy day, and this made it worthwhile. I'll be back.  To me, definitely worth the wait!  I only wish my Buffalo sister, Jennifer, could have had such a good experience before leaving the Valley.

If it weren't for the ice-cold A/C, this place would definitely get 5 stars! I just got home from dinner with my brother-in-law, who's in town for a conference.  He said "pick a nice place" and, of course, I chose Durant's! Valet parking.  Cute as a button, and I gave him the "I wanna put you in my pocket" line.   See, my sister and her family live in the OC.  Not much for flavor there.  When we walked in through the kitchen, the first thing the bro-in-law said was "Awesome!  Just like old Queens mobsters, walking in through the kitchen!" We were early for our reservation, but it didn't look like we needed it for a Monday night (come on, it's football season!) so we were promptly seated. Decor reminds me of my Hungarian/Polish grandparent's house.  Red velvet wallpaper and dark red leather booths.  Really plush and the booths could sit 4 comfortably.  There were some hotties in there, so I made sure to sit across from the bro-in-law!   One of the thing you KNOW means class is them giving out BLACK linen napkins if you're wearing black.  Nothing ruins a good night out more than white lint on your lap. The bread came and it was doused in an olive oil-basil-onion concoction.  I only had a little piece, but it was awesome!  It was already pre-cut, too.  Convenient! The BIL (keep up, that's brother-in-law and I'm gonna type it a bunch of times and that's just ridiculous) had to order the fried calamari, his staple.  Breading was light, but a bit too salty. The soup special was an onion-cheese and really rich and creamy.  I had the 8oz filet with a side of garlic mashed potatoes.  BIL got the scallops, which had pieces of bacon around the edges.  Both dishes were perfect.  My steak was done just right - medium rare.   We shared dessert.  Strawberry shortcake.  For 2.  We couldn't even finish it.  Topped with homemade whipped cream. The best touch, though, was the ambience.  Oh, and members of "the Family" at the table right next to us.  Ah, to hear that Queens accent again!   Definitely my top high-end restaurant in the Valley now!  I'll be back!  Not with the BIL, though.  I'll bring one of my boys.

I love the new location. I know, I know, everyone has been talking about it for years. I live in the 'hood, and didn't much like the old location. Walking into a cafe, only to see a sea of laptops, isn't very welcoming. Not their fault, of course.  The new location offers up some tasty treats. I've had a few of the breakfast and lunch items.   It can be a bit confusing to find it at first. You have to go in the back door. (Hahahahaha you know what *I* am thinking, right?) Picking up your order is tricky, because it gets loud in there and you may not hear your name called.  I prefer the back (front) room. Less traffic, and there's a cool bar to sit at.

I used to work right around the corner from here, and all of us "office girls" would go to lunch every month to "Los Dos." The machaca is excellent!  I love my food a bit spicy.  Hey, if it doesn't make you cry while you eat it, what's the point? Service is super-friendly and so are the other customers.   The place used to be a morgue or something.  I love the outdoor area to sit while waiting.

There is one sandwich I go here for, and it's one I crave when it's been awhile: The Cuban. It's loaded with ham, cheese, and pickles. One time they didn't have ham and made it with bacon for me. Do you understand how delicious that was? Do you?  I also get my beans here. The staff is extremely knowledgeable and the bean selection is awesome. I get the espresso. This place is always busy, but there's never a long wait for the food. I love the staff, too!

I used to live right around the corner from the N PHX location.  DANGEROUS! I love the menus!  Pick and choose what you want.  I always get the jade chicken with the spicy chicken and black beans.  Always a container of black beans to go, too! And snickerdoodles!  Who can resist????????????

Unfortunately, after living near the canal for 5 years, I haven't seen a dead body.  Seriously, it's my dream to find one.  I can see the TV crews and cameras now... The Grand Canal is now paved from 7th Avenue East.  I rode it with Robert M and Bacon all the way down to McDowell, and the paving continued.  No traffic to deal with, except for when crossing streets.   We saw some cool pottery, super-sized, as decor.  There are also several little parks in CenPho along the canal. I've read/heard that the city is actually going to start utilizing the canal as more of a park.  They'll be putting up more lighting and trees and little shops along the way.  I can't wait for that part!   I still need to see a floater, though.

I had never had gelato until my intern took me here about 8 months ago.  I remember it well, as I had just broken up with a loser and, like all girls, needed a treat! HOLY COW was I in heaven!  I tried a few samples (mostly because I love the little spoons!) and was HOOKED.   I love the Dulce de Leche.  Chocolate.  Coconut.  Ok, I have not had a bad flavor there yet! I always get two flavors to go.  This is where the extra star comes in:  They package it in styrofoam (who cares if it's bad for the environment, my gelato's in there!!!) and it made it home, still hard as a rock! I did research on gelato and it's actually better for you than ice cream!

Went late, late last night after the Fez hangout.  I feel guilt-free when going there!  We arrived a bit after 11:30 and let me just say I am soooooooo thankful (or scared) to know that it's open till midnight! Had the peanut butter (yes, another cream in my "Make Me Yelp" boyshorts) and a chocolate caramel brownie orgasm in a bowl. Service was super-friendly and the place was really clean.

I went with a party of 5 later one evening. The place was busy, but service was really quick. Despite being a larger party, everything went smoothly. The pizza was great! I love when you can taste a bit of the char on the bottom of the crust. It was also a little chewy on the edges, which is my favorite way to have pizza. I don't eat all of the crust, usually, but that night I did!

So, knowing I will be going here tonight, I look for my FEZ review.  Apparently, I never wrote one!  So, here goes: I used to work next door to FEZ up until the end of 2007.  I've been several times and I have never been disappointed with my food. What do I *really* come here for?  The sweet potato fries!  I've had the pear salad and even had brunch once with the Eggs Benedict.  DIVINE!  Of course, instead of the usual potato side, I got the sweet potato fries.  They come with a side of a sauce that is a little sweet, so I use it sparingly.   What else do I love about FEZ?  The hip decor and the crowd.  THIS is the crowd that I am hoping takes over the PHX.  Maybe the light rail will help!  Everyone is friendly and, well, I am a bit partial, but Thomas is the best GM ever! Don't forget the eye candy!  Yeah, most of the guys I bump into here are gay, but they're still pretty! I can't wait to go again tonight!

*burp* You know you have to put the guilt aside when it's lunch with your girlfriends.  More so when Dottsy suggested Matt's.   It was my first time, I remember it like it was yesterday.  Or, a half hour ago. Sign-in at the door to wait to be seated.  Gorgeous day out, so no big deal.  I took a seat on the bench outside and waited for Dottsy.  Then a lady sat at the other end of the bench and my side flipped up.   I had heard it was small...but not *this* small!  It was really cute and the staff was super-friendly.  I had to pee, though.  Apparently, the bathroom was off the kitchen.  OK.  I hope to myself as I make my way past the grills that I am not posing a health hazard to Matt's.  I mean, I was wearing a baseball cap, but no net!  Bathroom was tiny with no mirror.  That was ok for me, because, as I stated, it was baseball cap day.  The bathroom and its location are the only reason I took a star off. I got the cheddar and mushroom omelet.  Came with a side of hash browns and toast.  With a little cup of jelly.  At first, I didn't know it was jelly...until Dottsy saw a man put his little cup-o-stuff on his toast.  Omelet was huge, as was the hash brown.  The omelet was stuffed.  STUFFED with cheese and mushrooms.  I could see the butter on the plate.  Oh, man, this was gonna ROCK!  The hash brown was made from spaghetti-cut potatoes. Mmmmmmmmmmmyummy! I ate it all.  Everything.  I mean, I waited a half hour to be seated.  And my 20-year High School reunion isn't until July.  So, that's ok that I cleaned off my plate.  Right?  RIGHT???? Oh, and I ran into Dallas there.  Always a plus!

OMG 6 rolls of toilet paper in the ladies' room!  All unwrapped, on really nice wooden bars.  That's huge, boys.  Huge! I love the front door - it's metal and shiny and heavy.  This actually is used throughout the decor of the place.  Don't be fooled by the 'hood it's in.  Once you get inside, it's a different world. The center of the room is a U-shaped bar, like it should be!  On the far wall are a couple booths and high-top tables. A really long table is on the right, when you enter, and it's also got that steel-thingy going on. The bathroom is HUGE.  It's only for one.  They never run out of toilet paper!   *Shameless self-promotion warning* We do comedy here every Monday night.  It's $5.  Half the door goes to the winning comic.

This is in my 'hood, yo!  I come for the fish n chips.  Nothing more, nothing less.  I always have a great server and I can't remember her name but she has about 6 kids or something like that. My apartment building is close, so my neighbors also frequent Rosie's.  I seriously need to get there sometime for the music!

This was one of my stops tonight for First Friday.  I didn't even notice the place, when Dottsy shouted out "OMG Tammie Coe!" I instantly creamed because I had been wanting to try a treat from here forever! It cracked me up that I walked in, the only patron, and had to give my name and order to a boy standing near the door, then give the order to the cashier to fill.  I could see if it were busy, but we were the only ones here. I got the Gooey cupcake - dark chocolate (like my men! HA!) with a creamy frosting. How many ways are there to say DIVINE?????  The first bite was moist and the frosting was just right - not too sweet or soft.  It didn't get stuck all over my lip. They have Pellegrino in a bottle, so I got that too.  There's even a bottle opener on the wall!  How cool is that? Dottsy got a brownie and I had a bite.  WHOA.  A brownie that was still mushy-gushy and melting in your mouth. Just the way I like 'em!   I can't wait to get a cake! I may (if I ever choose to breed) name my first-born (boy or girl) Tammie Coe.

I am addicted to Bookman's.   I will go there with a certain amount of cash (usually $50) and promise myself I won't spend a penny more. Yeah, right. As soon as I walk in, I smell the books.  Some people don't like this smell, but as a voracious reader, I love it!  Smells like home :} So, I browse the books for at least an hour.  Sometimes, if I am looking for something specific, it won't take me as long.   Then, off to the DVDs.  I love the selection!  All those 80s movies and cheesy horror flicks! Even got an XBox here last year and a bunch of games.   they even have belly dancing classes on Sundays!

Funny how a small theater that shows mostly independent films could draw such a crowd! Went last Sunday to see "Milk" with Julia and Ayesha.  I ran into the bartender from Harley's in line.  Then, saw our own Amanda with her little girl outside, too! The line was a bit long but...OMG an electronic ticket machine!  Went straight for it with my debit in hand, got my ticket in less than 2 minutes.   The staff at the concession stand was awesome!  They were really funny and you could tell that they loved their job. The theater itself was nice.  Not stadium seats, which all the big theaters have.  We got seats close to the front, because it was *that* crowded and there were 3 of us.  Try finding 3 seats together on a Sunday afternoon!   Seats were comfortable.  Even though it's an older theater, there were still slots in the armrests for your drink.   This will definitely be my first choice, despite it being at Fashion Square.  I prefer independent films sometimes and this place was the top banana!

Food.  Awesome.  Service.  Awesome (Patty).  Ambience.  Awesome. Temperature.  SUCKED!  I froze through half my meal.  When I mentioned it to Patty, she said it happens at that part of the rotation.  For $80 a head (at least!)  you'd think they could take care of that!

I love IKEA so much!!!! I was so excited when the store opened up, I was there THAT day! Go hungry: there's a restaurant!  The salads are really good and of course you have to have the Swedish meatballs! I love carrying around that big, yellow IKEA bag.  Only thing is, I fill it up and it's so heavy I have to go get a cart.   And the little pencil!  Everything is labeled just right for me and my OCD!  Aisle, bin.  You can find everything you wanted. Check out the "As is" section.  Some of the stuff is only discontinued.  I got the coolest picture in that section. OK, the furniture is not always made of wood, but particle board and veneer.  That's not something you don't know before you go, though.  Some of the stuff IS genuine wood, though.  I bought a chopping block for my kitchen. I LOVE HAVING TO PUT STUFF TOGETHER!  I feel, as a single girl, that I've accomplished something.

When someone mentions Mexican for lunch, I just figure it's gonna be another 'berto's, but not this time! Popo's is NOT easy to find and I almost drove right by it. It's in a little strip mall on the north side of Indian School. I didn't realize there was parking in back, but there are a few in front and I was lucky enough to find one.  We got a HUGE booth! The whole place is pretty spacious and the seating is super comfy. I always ask for a booth. I don't know why, but I love a booth. I had a combo of a chili relleno, enchilada and rice and beans. Everything was fresh, if a little greasy. There was a puddle of grease under my rice, but I didn't care much because I was eating Mexican food. We got chips and salsa right as we were seated. Service was quick during out entire meal. We ended up staying after our server left (it was one of those lunch meetings with 4 people who like to talk a LOT and we had to get our tab and pay so our server could leave) and nobody gave us any hassle for staying a couple hours. I really liked the bathrooms! Super clean, without that damn southwest decor. I reallllllllly hate kokopellis and cacti and whatever else makes up the southwest theme. Hate. Blech! The prices were a couple dollars higher than what you'd normally see, but it was fine since the quality of food was really good.  Oh, and I was speaking Spanish to the hostess but apparently she didn't speak it. Whoopsie!

I've never, ever used the word "meh," but I have to for this place.  It's really cute, decorated nicely and the waitstaff was great, if a bit slow.  Fresh homemade tortilla chips and salsa were the key to my enjoyment of the food here.  I pigged out on them!  Julia and I were in that "I'm so hungry I'm cranky" mood, so I stuffed my face with the chips forever.  Fresh baskets were brought often, as well as each of us getting our own salsa bowl.  Oh, and a complimentary bowl of guac can't hurt, either! Then the entree came.  I was wanting ooey-gooey, cheese-smothered enchiladas.  I got the mushroom and spinach.  It came with a side of black beans and rice.  The enchiladas were made properly: the tortillas were soft-fried properly before adding the fillings.  But, not a lot of stuffing!  A few mushrooms, a few leaves of lettuce and that's pretty much it.  They were "covered" in a green sauce.  BARELY covered in green sauce.  I was disappointed, to say the least.  The rice?  Nothing fancy.  The beans?  MEH! The only thing that saved my meal was the company (Julia and Dossty!) and the never-ending supply of chips.   I probably won't go back.  Mariscos Playa Hermosa is right near there and I'd make that drive anyday!

Did the rooftop bar tonight.  Walking into the hotel, the lobby is super-chic!  I loved the bright colors and especially all the red! The elevator to the roof was different - the back wall was glass so you could see the bricks as you went up to the 4th floor.  It was hot in there, though. Got out of the elevator and I noticed all the rooms had AZ license plates to announce the room number.  Original idea!!! Got to the roof and...it's like the world stopped.  It's only 4 floors, but the view of the city is great.  The place was empty - 10pm on a Friday night???  I guess since it was First Friday and there was quite a crowd downtown, that people were still doing the art walk. Headed straight for a comfy couch and sat down, completely relaxed by the atmosphere.  I knew instantly that this would become a regular hangout for me. Only gripe was that, despite us being the only patrons, the tables were covered in empty glasses and bottles.  Bartender is Dallas, a fellow Yelper.  He's friendly and super-cute! Crowds started arriving around 11pm.  It was such a mix of people.  Dottsy and I came up with nicknames for each group: Tempe crowd (one girl was showing off her tattoo of the band Tool.  What a tool!); Scottsdale crowd (the girls asked us to take a pic, though one didn't even smile); Phoenix crowd (just regular people, not trying to impress, like us!) and then a few random folk. Soft music in the background.  This is what I liked best.  I spend a lot of time in clubs and it was nice to be able to have a conversation without trying to shout over the music. I'll be back.  Dallas, you'd better remember what I drink next time! (diet Coke with a hunk of lime)

My absolute favorite Thai restaurant in the Valley! I just happened upon this place over 4 years ago.  Though the decor was a bit cheesy, it has improved over the years. The service can't be beat!  As soon as my drink is almost empty enough to flag someone down, someone comes by and takes it for a refill.  I've never even had to remind them of what I'm drinking. What to get? The Thai beef sticks with peanut sauce to start.  (By the way, I never know the real names of stuff, so bear with me) They have green, red and yellow curry.  My favorite:  The red curry with shrimp and pineapple.  Ohhhhhhhhhhh my mouth starts watering as soon as I place my order. I always get two entrees, so I can take home the leftovers.  MY FAVORITE DISH HERE:  The catfish.  I order "Thai hot" and as soon as it hits the table, my head clears up and I dig in with such zest, it's like I haven't eaten for days. I love the rice, too!  Sticky and it holds the sauces well. Finish up with the coconut ice cream.  GREAT palate-cleanser! Prices are great, or I wouldn't get the extra food to take home!

I go there almost every week.  When my mom comes down from Payson to go shopping, we always end the day at Harley's.  Our favorite waiter, Justin, gave us both nicknames.  It's a real, down-to-earth place, where seriously...everyone knows my name! The food is GREAT!  I'm always ordering something different and have never been disappointed.   It's in Melrose, a neighborhood on 7th Ave between Camelback and Indian School.  I live nearby and can walk home to walk off my awesome meal. They also have a new outdoor patio. Service is excellent!

Harley's is my staple for a chill meal.  I enjoy coming here by myself, especially after a hectic day.  Well, I had had a hellacious week and after going to the SuTRA party tonight, with no dinner in my gut, I headed to Harley's around 8:30 for a bite to eat. I get their weekly email, which includes specials.  This week, they debuted new appetizers:  three different kinds of bruschetta.  I rarely get bruschetta because I am just not a huge bread person.  But, I saw "roasted garlic" and had to try it.  I've had just about everything on the menu here. I also ordered the calamari diavolo appetizer.  It's sauteed with HUGE hunks of garlic, served with their spicy red sauce - my favorite red sauce ever!   The bruschetta was ooey-gooey cheesy with a good portion of freshly chopped tomatoes on top.  Made me feel a little less guilty about the cheesy goodness. As always, Ed, the bartender, and my Justin made the evening!   It's such a comfortable place with friendly staff that I never stop raving about it.  Example: http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/bella/what_are_you_eating/

Oh, Slade and his cupcakes and the mess in my "Make me Yelp" boyshorts! Stopped in Friday, after calling earlier in the week to place an order.  I wanted to make sure my half dozen was what I wanted and didn't want them sold out! I even called a bit before going and Slade said the vanilla creme brulees were still cooling, so I waited a bit.  They were for my Mommy for Mother's Day and I would be driving to Payson to deliver.  They were boxed up and Slade even put some extra wrapping in the box to make sure they didn't slide around.  Put them on the floor of my passenger side, cranked up the AC.  No cold air.  Ugh. They made it OK and were a real hit with my 'rents. The red velvet were the first to be gobbled my mom and me.  Then, we sliced the vanilla creme brulee in half.  Both were "to die for" as my mom put it.  And the chocolate molten...I'll be getting more at "that time of the month" for sure! I left a "You've been Yelped" card just to be funny. I love Slade, but it's a tie with the love for his cupcakes!  (not to be confused with the FEZ waiters, who are my "cupcakes")!!!

Dexter ALWAYS gets spoiled here!  After Washington Park, where he was coated in every doggie fluid imaginable, he needed a bath.  Badly.  I didn't want him bringin' no doggie herpes home! They remembered his name as soon as we walked in.  He's quite the popular puppy here.  I used to live across the street and he just looooves the place! After a quick tutorial in the wash area, my 7-pound rat terrier was ready to be scrubbed.  They give you a few different brushes as well as shampoo AND conditioner!  I never thought to condition my pet's coat before.  He also needed his lil nails clipped.  I was whisked right in, even though the groomer was doin' a pomeranian.  It was quick and pain-free. Then, the treats.  Dexter loves the training treats!  We practice his tricks from school (PetSmart puppy class) every night and he devours the different treats. His favorite?  Peanut butter!  They had some star-shaped peanut butter treats and even a mini peanut butter pie, which he got a slice of. toys?  Tons!  Dexter needs squeakers.  Got him some long-ass, strange-looking pink dog that squeaks near its tail.  Bought it on Sunday and the dang thing already got decapitated.  There is white fluff all over my living room.   It's all good, though.  You can't have a 7-pound dog be a total wuss, you know?

I've been coming here for 5 years.  There have been a few different owners.  Tonight was only the second night I've ever peed here.  Why? The ladies' room floor was always sopping wet and the toilets didn't work.  Or, the lid was off the back.  Gross! The sound used to SUCK. New ownership for almost a year now.  I gotta say, Mardi Gras has really improved! There's the Voodoo Lounge in front.  Used to be a comedy room I ran.  Really nicely painted and furnished.  It's the "class" part of the Mardi Gras. Then, the main room, where live music is played.  I've been several times in the past few weeks to see some of the bands play.  I cannot BELIEVE the improvement in the sound system!  The crowd isn't as "haggard" as it used to be, though I did meet some cool peeps back in the day.   I like peeing here now.

It didn't smell funny when I walked in!  Staff was really helpful, especially when I spotted the Kate Spade bag in the case.  Of course, being the purse whore that I am, I had to buy it.   They had high-quality used and vintage clothing as well as electronics and appliances.  There's a stereo receiver I eyed for next paycheck.  $40!  Wait, I didn't tell you that.  DON'T BUY IT.   I spend about $50 on the purse, a skirt and shirt.   Oh, and if you need a fondue set, they have one.  Just invite me over when you use it, K?

I adore Chaser's and it's owner, Jason. Went for the millionth time tonight to see some of the bands.  Well, only two were playing that I know of and the place was dead.  Not the bar's fault.   I can't believe how much the place cleaned up!  Maybe I need to go on a night where there are more people, but it seems to have changed. Their women's restroom is really nice, classy kinda.  (I go to a LOT of local music shows and the bathroom is *key*!) Cheap drinks (so I'm told, since I don't imbibe) with a great selection.   Staff is friendly. You see all kinds here, which is why I love it!

I honestly cried when I checked out. I spent my birthday weekend here. A staycation. I had done some work for the hotel, and got a room for two nights as pay. (This means I didn't pay $$ for it. It wouldn't have made a difference of my review, though. I would have paid for this!) I had arranged for a happy hour gathering with friends. I barely got out of my car at the valet, before I heard people telling me "Happy birthday, Amy!" (Some said "Fab," too.) I got the cutest birthday card, too. Make sure you tell them if it's a special occasion!  I was checked in promptly and when I walked into the room, it just felt really comfortable. The decor and furnishings are masculine, but not overbearingly so. I had a leather wall!!!! The first thing I tested, of course, was the bed. Super comfy with tons of pillows. It was just me, so I drowned in pillows. There's a nice working area as well, with wifi. It's $12/day, which is what other hotels charge, too. I had no problems with the speed or connectivity, either. The staff here is nothing short of amazing. As soon as I asked for something, I got it. I ate at both Marston's and the ICON lounge, and the food was amazing!  The chef uses some of his grandmother's recipes, and they've certainly stood the test of time. The Renaissance also uses locally-produced food as much as possible. Tammie Coe, anyone? They are ambassadors to Downtown Phoenix, and out-of-towners will always get great advice on things to do while in the area. Go check it out. Spend some time there. Oh, and say hi to Rhonda in the ICON lounge. She's worked there for over 30 years!

Walking into The Lost Leaf, I instantly knew I'd be back again!  Live music playing in the back room, great crowd and artsy decor spelled "Home" for me. Went with a bunch of other Yelpers (Happy Birthday, Jacqui!) and had a blast.  The music wasn't so loud I couldn't hear anyone I was talking with.  Seemed like an awesome beer selection, though I didn't see what wine was offered. I am one of the few who really likes the high-tops.   The clientele was a younger crowd of Phoencians enjoying what the downtown of PHX has to offer.  It was full, but I think I expected a larger crowd on a Saturday night.   The local art on the walls made it seem less pretentious than most places.  And, the wood!  Wood everywhere!  I thought I was back East.  Hardwood floors, beamed ceiling.  I could picture it as a place to go after skiing back home.   I thought the kitchen was cute, but a little "homey".  I swear I saw a dishwasher, and not an industrial one! Of course, couldn't beat the company!  Jacqui and Dave B, Nathan, Kristin, Stevey P and my favorite boys, Thomas and Ricky made the night A+

Back East, most grocery stores have a bulk section.  Not so in Phoenix.  That's why I love Sprouts so much. The bulk section has a HUGE selection of whatever you need to buy in bulk!  I always get a huge bag of banana chips, pumpkin seeds, oatmeal (I like the kind that's chewy and takes more than a minute to cook :P), rice and chocolate-covered pretzels.   Their ethnic selection is decent, too. Always clean, staff loves to chat while ringing stuff up.

We ordered lunch for delivery from here today.  I had never, ever had a reuben in my life.  Never had sauerkraut, either!  A guy at work yesterday had a reuben and I just had to try it. Deliver took forever.  I mean FOR-EVER!   Sandwich was ok, if a bit soggy (could be from being wrapped so long during the delivery).  I was disappointed at the flavor, though.  Not much at all! My co-workers had salads, and I wish I had gotten one, too. It was an OK lunch, but I probably won't eat there again.

I would much rather have tried the Downtown location, but, lo, I was dating a guy from Gilbert.  That lasted 2 weeks.  The date, not the food. Good enough, I guess.  I had some sandwich but it wasn't very memorable.  It came out pretty quickly, even though it was 5 minutes to closing time.  I'm guessing it was microwaved. I'll definitely go back, just not to this location.

My ex took me on a "guilt" weekend here a bit ago.  He got me a massage, body wrap, the works! The room was really cozy and the bed was so comfortable I didn't want to get up...but I had that darn massage to get to! We had dinner and the staff was extremely friendly.  What really "made" the weekend, though, was the spa! First, I had a deep tissue massage.  Divine.  Not bad for a hotel spa, you know? Second, I had a red wine body wrap.  Since I can't drink it, might as well soak in it, right?  She slathered on the red wine/aloe mixture.  It felt sooooooooooooo good...but nothing compared to when it was all done and she covered me up for a half hour and put heavy blankets on me.  I fell asleep! The cool part was when she unwrapped me.  I looked like the mom & daughter from Poltergeist when they were covered in jelly but it really looked like afterbirth.   There's a private shower in the room to get all the "gunk" off. I was so relaxed!   Parking was a bit complicated and why I took away one star.  Meh.

NOTE:  I only had take-out, and it was brought to me by my boss.  She rules! She got me a hummus/grilled/marinated chicken combo.  It has 3 different hummus...es...es (HA!): roasted red pepper, jalapeno and plain ole' hummus.  They are sectioned off in the big plastic container, which rules for my OCD, as I don't like my food touching.  In the center is a PILE (a total monton!) of grilled chicken.  It's got some sort or spicy rub on it, but not too much kick.  It had been marinated, too.  And tender....I think this is the most tender chicken I have ever had.  It made my own tender spots as juicy as the chicken was! I'm not big on pita, so instead she got me a side of cukes.   This thing weighs a ton and I've been eating it for 2 hours.  I have made a mess in my "Make me Yelp" boyshorts.

Dexter loved it!  He's a 7-pound rat terrier and extremely social (I have NO idea where he gets it from!).  Went with Robert M and Brady.  When we got there, there were only a couple of other dogs.  By the time we left, there were probably around 20. The park is clean, with plenty of seating for "the people" and lots of shade. Chuey, a toy silkie, had his way with Dexter and so did a beagle. Dexter ran like there was no tomorrow!  This was his first dog park.  Had to take him to Wag N Wash after, though, as he was covered in a few different types of doggie fluids.

Oh. My. God. I just went in here for the first time.  I live right next to Bazaar Noir, and just *had* to check out Curiouser and Curiouser because Bazaar Noir is still shut down (they had a fire about a year ago). The lady who own is, Viol (?) is a HOOT!  Don't go in there thinking you are going to "just browse".  She is a sales lady BEYOND sales!   I needed something specific - a dresser.  She didn't have one, but gave me the address of a friend of hers that has a consignment shop on Thomas.  She even called the guy for me! What will you find here? Day of the Dead candy (it's probably been there since November!), purses made out of dead toads (I am not kidding!), leopard lamps, purses, clothes, little books from kindergarten, dishes...vintage jewelry...just name it, it's there! (except for a dresser.  bummer). Here's the kicker: she has a LIVE snake living inside a coffee table.

Holy cow!  I just did the whole Melrose antique/retro tour and also wanted to check out Metro Retro. By far, the CLEANEST place!  Classiest, too.   They guys who own it are awesome and I stayed and chatted for about 15 minutes. They didn't have what I was looking for, but if you want retro furniture that's in *really* great shape and *really* funky, this is the place to go!

Nothing fancy. Kind of a rowdy crowd. I'd consider this more than a bar than restaurant. Service was really friendly, though. Food wasn't spectacular. I was here for a gig, but I'm not sure I would have gone otherwise. I do, however, love when a venue supports local comedy.

Poor Dexter got an ulcer on his cornea. My regular vet sent me here to have it checked out. It was bad enough that they immediately took him in back to get prepped for surgery. Near tears, they assured me he'd be ok. My biggest fear wasn't the surgery, it was the cost. Thankfully, they offer a few different payment options. We have since been back for 2 check-ups. Every time we go, everyone is excited to see Dexter. They told me they changed their mind about rat terriers because of his upbeat, friendly disposition. He's 12 pounds of fury!  The staff is awesome. The facility is awesome. My dog is awesome!

Kerstin, I'm really sorry for your loss and your ordeal.  I, on the other hand, had a good experience here the other night. I got in from California this past Saturday and noticed my 16-year old cat, Daisey, was extremely lethargic and not peeing where she was supposed to.  She barely ate her nightly treat (my cats are spoiled and get a dollop of wet food at dinnertime) or the little treats I had gotten at PetSmart.  She also practically collapsed onto my lap, when she usually walks around a bit and liked every part of her little body scratched.  I texted my friend Maura, who's a veterinary neurosurgeon (#thevet) and she said she had a friend who was there right then and gave me directions. It wasn't too far from my house.  As soon as I walked in and told them I would have to put my Daisey to sleep, they whisked her away for the arm catheter and put me in a private room.  The LAST thing you want to do in this situation is sit in a waiting room, crying. They came in after just a few moment with my paperwork and went over all the different urns I could buy.  The price wasn't more than what I had paid at Alta Vista (will NEVER go there again!), so I signed and waited for my Daisey.  Dr Rose (I can't remember her last name!!!) is Maura's friend and brought Daisey in.  They gave me as much time as I needed, alone, with her.  I really didn't want her suffering to go on much longer, so as soon as I called, the doctor came right back in.  I got to be with Daisey until the end. Today, I got a sympathy card in the mail and a phone call about her ashes being ready.   Picking them up was a really quick process and, though painful, not their fault. They have cats there that were abandoned that live there, in the office, and serve as blood donors.  How awesome is that?? I even brought Dexter with me, as I am looking for a new vet for him.  They only do emergency services, but gave me a postcard with several vets in the area. I wouldn't hesitate to go there again!

This place never ceases to amaze me.  Usually, I go to the one on Camelback near the Biltmore.  I now work in the Scottsdale Airpark, so I go to FLW.   I love walking into Trader Joe's.  It feels so peaceful and happy and...nice!   I wanted hummus.  Found two kinds that are DE-LISH!  Roasted garlic and the other is spicy hummus.   A girl at the office had these cheese puffs and I had to get them!  they are Buccaneer Joe's White Cheddar corn Puffs. YUM!  I also got some dunkers.  They are good for a sweet fix.  Flowers were cheap and I wish I were home more often to buy some to enjoy. Minus one star for my grumpy cashier.  Geesh.  He works at Trader Joe's - be happy about that!  I adore Trader Joe's.  I would grab its hand, hop in the R32 and take it to Vegas!

Being from the East Coast, it's extremely difficult to find good pizza here.  I live less than a mile away from Z, and I'm grateful to have found it! I love the toppings!  They even have a white pizza, which nobody east of Lake Erie seems to know about! The staff is always friendly.  I like going there by myself, reading the paper or New Times, and chatting with the staff while I wait for my order. Yes, price is higher than most, but I'm willing to pay for it!

I met Jayson a couple years ago through another comedian.  He had been at one of our mutual gigs and laughed hysterically while I was onstage.  Actually, that's what I *think* he did.  Anyway, that was 2 years ago and he gave me his card.  I just found it in my purse on the SAME DAY he found me on Facebook.  That, folks, is destiny. I got an awesome rate for my new car and exemplary service from him and Brittany.  The guy is busy as hell, but took the time to work with me.  He even asked for details on any future gigs. Seriously, if anyone wants to come see me laugh, they'll get my biz!

It's like Cheers.  Everyone knows my name.  I get a bi-monthly manicure and monthly pedicure here.  I had a guy there give me a pedicure once, but he sucked.  Now, I ask for Helen.  When I call, my name must pop up on caller ID because the owner, Trina, answers "Hi Amy".  How cool is that??? If you want a GREAT pedicure, treat yourself to the delux.  You're worth it, and so am it. Ask for Helen.  She rocks!

HOTTEST WAITER IN CENPHO ALERT!  I went tonight with Tony A for my first (finally!) visit to St. Francis.  I had first heard about it from Sunny B. and couldn't find it for a week after I read her review.  Duh!   It's right next to my bank!  When Tony suggested we go, I jumped right on that bandwagon! We had about a 15 minute wait.  The place looked packed, so 15 minutes was fine.  We sat outside and chatted for a bit.  We even talked about how cool it would be if we could sit upstairs.  Guess what?  WE WERE SEATED UPSTAIRS!!   Que milagro! Our waiter.  *sigh*  I shall hereforth refer to him as Dreamboat Brandon.  (spell check says "hereforth" isn't a word.  Is it???)  First of all, anyone who can deal with Tony and I together get major kudos.  We can be...raunchy brats when together.  Dreamboat Brandon rode the wave.  Great service on keeping our drinks filled and not hovering, even though the both of us would have loved that! I had the ahi sandwich, based on other reviews.  YUMMY!  It came with avocado and tomatoes and what I *think* was a horseradish mayo.  There was a little cup of homemade potato chips on the side.  Nice, thick (no, I'm not talking about Dreamboat Brandon!) steak of ahi on a thick Kasier-type roll.   The Arnold Palmer was made with mango iced tea, which was totally perfect with my meal. I love the decor!  Tony said I *had* to check out the bathroom.  Good thing I had to pee.  I couldn't figure out how to open the door to the WOMEN'S restroom and then it opened from inside...by a guy.  He said he couldn't wait.  I gave him the lecture on how WE have to wait in line at concerts and footballs games.  AND he had left the seat up.  Anyway, the bathroom was really funky.  There's even a safe in the wall, which I tried, while peeing, to open.  To no avail.   All of the staff was friendly and it was just a really cool atmosphere.  It's definitely a place CenPho needed.  I have never seen it empty, even on weeknights.  I am glad that it's so close to home.  I am also glad that they seem to be doing pretty well.  I would hate to see Dreamboat Brandon without a job.  Of course, I do need an assistant...

I'm donating my kidney.  I've been here for tests 3 times in the past week and have a few more days to go before the actual surgery. Each day, I have an itinerary to follow.  For my appointments last week, I was there for 10 hours.  It sounds like a lot, and it is, but rarely was any of that time spent waiting to be called for an appointment.  At the end of the day, I get a print-out of the next tests I need with appointments.  They've been very accommodating of my crazy life and schedule and have really gone the extra mile to make sure to schedule things when I can be there. You check in, sit and wait for 5 minutes until your name is called.  I have never seen anything as organized as this!!!  Everyone is really friendly and informative and never seemed bothered by my questions.   I mean, I'm giving someone an organ.  They'd better treat me well, right? For my surgery, I am only expected to spend one night here.  I'm gonna play it like I need another night...just because I am treated so well there!

The first thing I do when I walk into UO is go straight to the back.  AMAZING sales and cool stuff on sale - not just rejected stuff! I agree - the women's selection here is better than Tempe and (I can't believe I am saying this) I actually prefer to go to the Scottsdale location. Yes, the college kids can be irritating!  I always wear my headphones just so I don't use some strange bobble-head I find at UO to knock someone out!  "Like OH MY GOD Brittany, did you SEE anything in a size zero?"

What do I love about Club Red/Red Owl?  It's two venues in one!  I am there just about every weekend.  If I don't like one band, I just walk to the other side of the building. The bathroom is CLEAN!  Retro decor, too.   Nice staff.  Really hot guys behind the bar :}

Another instance of hearing people talk about a place for years before I got there. I live in CenPho, and making the trek to Gilbert happens every few years for me. Until now. My boyfriend lives out there, so I am starting to check places out now. I love the Farm. The restaurant itself reminds me of the architecture of a drive-in snack bar. It's wide open with a lot of glass. There is a long, family-style table in the main room. There is another room off that, and a ton of picnic tables outside. I had a burger with garlic fries. I still think of those fries! My burger was cooked perfectly, as I like my meat rare. My favorite parts, though, were the root beer floats, and the bathrooms. You make your own root beer floats. They give you the cup with the soft-serve ice cream in it, and you go over to the pop machine and add as much as you want. So cool! I really want to take the tour they offer here. I grew up in the country, and after living in the city for 11 years, it's quaint for me and reminds me of home. (Upstate NY)

OMG!!!!!!!!!  I CRAVE boba.  Whenever I go visit my sister in the OC, we go everyday.  I have been looking for one since my last visit, Thanksgiving. I walked into Eba and found...HOME!  I was so excited I nearly peed my pants! They have a huge selection of drinks...tea, iced tea, milk and tea, etc.  You can choose either green or black tea.  Then, there is a wide range of "chewies" to add.  I, of course, go the boba.  I think I said "boba" at least a dozen times in there.  The entire time I am there, I'm on the phone with my sister, asking her what I order out there. So, I ordered two of the biggest chocolate-black tea-and-milk boba. mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm I am playing Powerball today.  This has to be a good sign!

OK so it took a bit to find it.  I took Central from my place and then learned that it's only one way at this end.  No biggie.  Took 1st ave or St and got there ok. Walking into the Ruby Room, you immediately feel at home.  The staff at the bar is super-friendly (and CUTE!) and easy to talk to. The sound system was pretty good, too.  I was there to perform and can't stand a crappy sound system while trying to make people laugh. The red walls give it an other-worldly feel.  Romantic, warm, foreign...that's how I feel there!

We have our bi-monthly marketing meetings here. The staff already knows my name (I've been there 3 or 4 times), they know what I like to drink (soda water with hunks of lime) but they still call all of us "babe" or "sugar" or "honey". I like that.  Great portions. I always get the biscuits and gravy. The biscuits are HUGE and I never finish them, because they come as a side with my breakfast. Go reallllllllllllllllllly early (be there BY 7!) to get a table without waiting. Food is breakfast food, but it's generous. My waffle was as big as my plate. The has browns take up half my plate. The biscuits, huge (can you tell I really like the biscuits???). I haven't had the pancakes, but I've seen them and the stack is huge. Big food. Awesome servers. Decent prices.  It's like eating at Mel's Diner and you get your very own Flo. Without the gum behind the ear.  (They've moved to Bell & 51st Ave)

Went to see My Doll tonight and walked from The Sets.  This is an awesome place to see live music, especially if you are a punk like me! It's really well-lit for a bar!  Never a cover charge, which is always a plus. The shows are always fun and tonight I almost got wiped out in the pit.  500 cool points for that! Takes awhile to get a drink from the bar, but that's a good and bad thing.  Good - you know there's a crowd.  Nothing like a dead place with bands playing. Bad - well, if you're really jonesin' for a drink, you have to wait.  Suckas!

I'm not one of those people that knows everything about sushi.  I just know I like it.  I have a hard time ordering, too, because I don't know what everything is.  This is exactly why I like Sushi Brokers. The girl I work with has a sister that works there.  She went yesterday for lunch and brought me back some take-out to save for dinner.  I like that I can customize my order  - wrapped in cucumber instead of rice and extra wasabi, please!  I had the scallop rolls and they were yummy!   Went the next night with Jacqui after the roller derby.  Luckily, we are on the same level with sushi - we both know we like it but aren't as versed as some.  They gave us two menus right away (I only wrote that because of another review that only had one at the table) and explained some of the things on the menu.  The cool thing is that on the back, there's a bigger explanation of each roll.  Our waitress was so-so but warmed up a bit to us as the meal went on. Jacqui and I shared the Cowboy roll (it's a bit spicy!) and the Eel and Cucumber roll.  We each also ordered a snow crab roll.  All were *really* good.  We left stuffed, but not in a way to make you feel like after Thanksgiving dinner.  Just right!   Our food didn't come as quickly as I thought it would, but we weren't getting antsy at the pace.  Of course, good conversation with Jacqui is always a plus! Our water was refilled constantly (YAY!) and the waitress even asked when we got out bill if it was going to be all on one card.  That was cool, since sometimes it's a pain to ask people to split the bill.   I mentioned during our dinner that the music wasn't bothering me *too* much.  Either it was loud enough for me to notice or it was somehow slipping into my subconscious. DEFINITE Scottsdale crowd!  Jacqui asked "Doesn't if feel like we're not Downtown right now?"  and I had to totally agree! Oh, and it was so cold in there, we were happy to go outside.  In Phoenix.  In mid-June.

I've been performing here for a couple of years.  There's a comedy show every Wednesday and it's free.  But enough of the shameless self-promotion... Bongo's is a bar and grill.  There's a huge TV for whatever popular game is on that night.  (I rarely watch because there are COMEDIANS onstage!) The service is ultra-friendly, especially Kara.   It's typical bar food, but they have a huge menu.  There's something for everyone.  Me?  I'm quite partial to the cheese fries.  Yup.  Fries with cheese-in-a-can.  It's my guilty pleasure every time I perform there. There are regulars, like this one lady who feeds her kids then stumbles over to drink.   If you want a friendly, down-to-earth sports bar to hang out in, go to Bongo's.  If you're hungry, go to Bongo's.  If you want to laugh and eat and drink, go to Bongo's.  On Wednesday nights.  :}

First reason I decided to go here:  Locally-owned in Melrose.  My 'hood (well at least for the next 24 hours) Second reason:  It's owned by a GIRL! Third reason: Educational seminars on maintenance for your car.  Seriously, I don't understand how some people can't check their own oil, so I hope they take some initiative and go to class! Fourth reason: Yelp reviews. So, Baby needed an oil change.  Badly.  Like needed fluids more than an illegal crossing the desert.  I pulled in today around noon.  Bogi's mom works the counter, and she's from back East, so we did a lot of talking.   I was there for about an hour, but I hadn't made an appointment, so I had no problem with it.  I got to chat with Bogi and her mom and totally hand a native Arizonan his ass as he dissed NY/NJ.  I mean, did he really think he could go up against 3 East Coast chicas and win????  He was walking funny on the way out, I tell ya what. The invoice had a note on it that my front tires were getting low on tread, which is great because with low-profiles, you have to keep an eye on them. The bill?  $37.00 and some change.  For an oil change.  No pressure to get synthetic, which is way more costly. Thank, Bogi and your mom, for making my oil change painless.  East Coast sisters unite!

Have you ever gotten an orgasm from peanuts?  No?  Well, I just did. Number 27.  Medium hot.  Went with Robert M & Bacon for dinner tonight and we each got a dish to share.  Started with the fried tofu.  Bland.  the sauces were watery.  Also got shrimp rolls.  Yummy. In all, we had a red curry (#26) which was good, but it seemed as if the green beans had been frozen then cooked.  Also, the #34, medium spicy.  Had a peanut taste, a little sweet.  And then: #27.  (angels singing) Now, I don't know the names of any dishes.  I always order by number.  When it came to the table, I drooled all over my white shirt.  And, well, something else in my white panties.  Amazing! Service was quick and friendly.  I love that it's RIGHT ON McDowell.  Tables face the street, which you don't get very often here in the PHX. My leftovers are in the fridge.  Since I'm single and need the *ahem* effects of #27, I'll be having it before bed.  As a snack.  To get ready for bed.  #27.  Marry me.  I'll be the first person to marry a number.

My mom gets jealous when I tell her I'm going to Super Target.  See, she lives in Payson and only has *gulp* WalFart up there. The parking lot is spacious and it's always easy to find a convenient spot to park in. Walking in, I feel such a sense of calm.  The aisles are wide, there aren't a million screaming, dirty kids running around, and it's not loaded with the kiosks you'll find at WalWhiteTrashMart. Prices are decent and there's always some sort of price cut, usually exactly what I need at the moment. Grocery selection is great for a non-grocery place.  Could use help on the produce, though. People are always friendly and it seems they enjoy working here. What gives it 500 cool points????  The parking lot security guy.  On a Segway!!!!!!!  You won't find THAT at WalIAlwaysGetPinkeyeMart!

I love the 51! You can see Alice Cooper's house near the Glendale exit. Even the cheesy pottery decorations make me smile. I also love that I go opposite of rush hour traffic during rush hour.   Hey, man, I can't drive 55, let alone 45!

Listen up!  I go for the food.   I got suckered into taking 2 14-year old girls.  The boss' daughter and her BFF.  I dragged Jenni from work so I could have an adult around. The only rides I went on were the chair lift and the giant ferris wheel.  Anything that would mess my hair is O-U-T out!   Walking into the fair was worse than WalFart as far as sensory overload goes.  But, that's what the fair's for, right? We got there around 7, so there wasn't too much of a crowd.  Had to stop immediately and catch part of the demolition derby.  I have always wanted to do derby - demolition or roller!   Ah, the crowd at the fair.  I have never seen so many sorry souls in one place!  Seriously, Jenni and I saw a dozen different people with some sort of neck wound.  WTF??? The petting zoo was cute, but reminded me of why I went vegetarian years ago.  It also made my token 14-yr old question her meat-eating.  There was even a camel!  A CAMEL!  In the desert!  Fancy that! The food.  Ahhhhhhh fair food!  Got curly fries for $6.50.  I would have complained about the price but MAN ALIVE it was a huge plate!  I shared it with everyone - even random peeps workin' the games! On the way to the car, we each got a funnel cake.  I had mine with just powdered sugar.  Jenni did, too.  The girls had their own, too.  One got the apple and I had a bit.  Yum!  The other got strawberries with whipped cream.  14-year old girls can eat that, ya know.  37-year olds only dream of it. I bumped into a few people I knew, which was cool. By the time we left at 9:30, the place was PACKED.  My boobies got elbowed by countless people who don't even realize they had the privilege.  Snooze, ya lose!

Finally checked this place out during the Melrose Street Fair last week.  The selection is UNBELIEVABLE!  I even told them I would work for free on weekends!  Like High Fidelity! There is vinyl.  Lots of vinyl.  I wish I still have my record player.  That's right.  I don't say turntable :P  I'm old skool. The CD collection was awesome!  Went there with a male friend, same age as I am.  We kept shouting out "Holy crap, The Tubes!"  And "OMG they have Black Flag!" Prices are very reasonable.  Staff is super-friendly. GO THERE!

I love the PHX in winter! I grew up in Buffalo NY, so no matter what time of year (yes, even summer!) I deserve to live here! I'm out walking my 'hood today, just back from Thanksgiving in the OC.  It's sunny, a bit breezy, and....*gasp*...no jacket!  In November! My parents finally came to Arizona in April to settle in Payson.  One thing they always remark on...the sunsets in AZ! I've lived everywhere around the world, and I've decided Phoenix is where I'm stayin'!

I'm tired of the rain and cold.  In Phoenix.  I've got my electric blanket on and even my dog is sleeping on the bed to keep warm!   Why does it seem colder this year?  Why are my knuckles cracking?  Why do I need a hot bath every night to warm up before bedtime?  Why? Why? Why? Still better than Buffalo, that's for sure!

Is there such a thing as orgasm in a bowl?  YES!  Crawfish ettouffee at Pappadeaux! I had no idea this was a chain restaurant, or I probably wouldn't have gone.  I'm a mom-and-pop snob :} Anyway, we had a party of 6 and had about a half hour wait.  We had reservations.  It was a beautiful night, so sitting out on the patio was no big deal.  The hostess even came by once during our wait to let us know they hadn't forgotten about us! I don't usually get fried calamari (I prefer non-fried seafood) but it was light and crispy and the calamari wasn't rubbery at all. Service was great, too.  We never had to ask to have our glasses refilled. it's a great place for a date or a group!

The name says it all!  The salon is FILLED with art.  Everywhere you look, there is something to look at!  It's very industrial.  There's even a VW bus inside! The staff is super-friendly and very knowledgeable.  If you want something cutting-edge in hair, this is the place to go! Tad, the owner, is a staple of the Phoenix arts scene.   On Saturdays, they have a live DJ spinning tunes.

I've been doing Bountiful Baskets for about 3 months now and I was really surprised at the quality of produce! Every week, Christina P, Amber W and I get the basket.  We rotate the pick-up and pay.  What's awesome about this is that every Sunday or Monday, we get together to make dinner and then split what's left.  I remember as a kid, being raised by a single mom, going to the food co-op and it was hit-or-miss.  Some things had begun to rot and you had to make it that day.  Not so with Bountiful Baskets.  Everything's fresh, sometimes not even ripe.  That's good, because you get a LOT of food and waiting a couple days just makes you eat what's ripe earlier.   They also have add-ons of specials.  Last week, we got 48 ears of corn.  I'm not kidding!  Luckily, that got split 4 ways, but I'm still trying to make salsa and elote like a madwoman.   I like the Kodiak Produce pick-up.  First of all, it's at 11am so I don't have to get up at the ass-crack of dawn on a Saturday.  Second, they have extra stuff you can take.   Plus, it's the closes to Downtown. I love that we get stuff sometimes that is different than what I'd usually buy.  There's a squash in the box right now that I'm going to have to research.   The two best things I like?  Well, I'm eating more fresh fruit and veggies.  Nature's broom!  AND I get to spend some quality time with friends every week.  I think it's good to take a breather and cook homemade food at least once a week.

I had no idea that I couldn't get anything made with espresso here.  I had seen people reviewing and checking in on FourSquare, but didn't know that the place across the street had a bigger coffee bar. No biggie, had a plain coffee.  This is a really cool place to go.  There is seating in really random places, so I picked the back room.  It had an old van bench seat and shelves of books.  Lots of cool art on the walls and a set-up for someone to play guitar.  Or something. You can even shop here!  Some clothing & accessories along with whatever else the people running it are interested in. It's in the Roosevelt district, so plenty of parking on the street during the day. They offer vegan baked goods, too. I'll be back, even though I can't get an Americano.  I like the vibe.

OMG!  I had read about Off Chute Too here on yelp and live right near it, so I decided to stop in today after work.  Not really knowing what to expect, I walked in and my jaw dropped.  HOME!  Most of the stuff is geared toward gay men, but they do have a small women's section.  The guy running the place was really nice and we talked about how hard it is to get a date!  *lol* We even got to talking about some of the "tools" in the display case.  I am pretty educated on the fetish lifestyle, but there were 2 things I had never seen/heard of.   Got a cute purse (OMG I shouldn't have but I had to because it's my birthday next week and I just won't show it to Mom, ok????? So shut up already!) and fishnet shirt.

This place is awesome!  Got together with some friends I haven't seen in over a year.  They mentioned the Rose and the Crown.  As soon as I walked in, I felt at ease.  I walk in, and a couple people knew me, so it felt friendly instantly. The staff is awesome!  Super-friendly and attentive, without being down your throat. I told them to expect me back everyday.  Teehee!

OMG!  The BEST French fries in town!  Real, fresh-cut fries with the skin still on. The perfect crispness and greasiness!   Their burgers are to die for.  Freshly cooked, pure beef. The place has been around for 57 years.  It's had a total of 4 owners in that entire time. Really nice people and service, too!

Blech. Had to work at U of Phoenix Stadium today and Mom came down from Payson to meet me for lunch after.  I don't know Westgate at ALL except for the hockey arena.   It's in an outdoor mall, like everything else.  We were starving and the entire mall was DEAD.  It looked like places were closed, so we went to Margaritaville for lunch. Main entrance isn't clearly marked and we went in through the patio area.  Walked in and didn't see a reception area.  So, we asked the nearest waitress if we were to seat ourselves.  She said in her best airline stewardess voice "Ovah they-ah is where you check-in."  It was fake and annoying.  So, we go check in.  15 minute-wait for 2 people.  The place was crowded, but we had passed a few empty tables along the way.  My mom even pointed it out.  "Our kitchen is pretty backed-up, so we can't seat all tables right now."  Keep in mind this was at 12:30 on a Saturday afternoon.  Wouldn't this be the time to make sure you know to have enough kitchen staff on hand??? We meandered to the bar, which was empty except for 2 people.  We sat at the corner and, luckily, found out we could eat there.  The bartender was the first friendly person we came across, and I'm glad SHE got a tip from us.  Service was quick.  Our food came out within 10 minutes.   Mom got the chicken quesadilla, I got the taco salad.  I couldn't believe how FEW items were on the menu.  I was expecting a bit more.   Food was average.  Nothing I'd ever go back for. They kept showing videos of Jimmy Buffet and the people at his concert.  They were having WAY more fun than we were.  NOBODY shouted out "Where's the salt?  Where's the goddamn salt?"  I would have, but my Mom's been suffering from almost 40 years of embarrassment from me already. Blech.

I haven't had acrylics done in years and with my new job, really want to look professional.  I REALLY needed to have my nails done! I live nearby, so stopped in to Seatop.  It's incredibly clean!  That's my biggest thing with nail salons.  There was only one person working, and she was just finishing up with someone else. I wanted the white-tipped nails.  I'm used to a guy names Dan who used to do them.  He used clear tips, then painted them white.  I prefer this method.  Seatop uses white tips.  I was a little put-off by it, but they look great!  The woman who did them was extremely detailed.  They also have a long row of pedicure chairs.  I plan on going back there this weekend to get my piggies pampered!

Do NOT go here!  It used to be Taste of India or something like that.  I went out of my way on a weekly basis to go there.  Until just last weekend.  Ugh.  The pakoori were plain old fried veggies.  The Chicken Tikka Masala had chunks of...something white.  The chicken itself seemed ok (how can you screw up tandoori???) but I will never, EVER go there agin! NE corner 32nd St and Greenway. *sigh*

Gabi brought Golden Spoon to the radio show tonight.  She asked me which flavor, I said "chocolate" without hesitation (Hey, girls need chocolate!) I've never been a fan of froyo in the past, but I'm hooked! The chocolate had little tiny chocolate chips - so cute! It was rich and creamy and didn't have that yogurt bite that it used to.  That tanginess (My spellcheck underlined it, I think I just made up a new word!  Trademark!) that really doesn't go with anything frozen was completely absent.  Thanks Gabi!  I'll definitely stop by again.  Maybe for my next radio show! YUMMY!

Can someone please tell me why people go here???  Went to breakfast with Deb L, and she had a Living Social deal or one of those deal thingies. The place was packed, probably because it's a holiday week.  That doesn't excuse the EXTREMELY poor service. We sat down and waited. And waited. Servers walked by every few moments, nobody stopped to fill our water glasses or take our order. Finally, we both said something to a girl who walked by. She seems mystified that there was a job to do. With that many people working, getting a cup of coffee shouldn't take 15 minutes. Yes. 15 freaking minutes.  Food? Mediocre at best. I got the traditional eggs benedict with home fries. The only saving grace with the amount of ham on it. The English muffin didn't seem to be toasted. The eggs were *ok* but nothing great. The home fries? My 9-year old niece could do a better job. My burps right now aren't even good enough to brag about.  I'm sure if the service had been better, I wouldn't be so miserable right now. My food coma isn't satisfying. I will *never* go here again. Ever. I felt stupid leaving a tip, it was THAT bad.   Total. Fail. Blech.

While waiting for Ayesha to have dinner at Thai Elephant, I tried not to let the meth-crack-head who pretended to talk on the pay phone deter me from a great meal.  She had no shoes on and walked up to the pay phone and started talking.  It hadn't been ringing and she didn't dial a number.   I'm a sucker for Touch of Thai's catfish dish, and they had the same one on the menu.   It was good, but the fish was a bit overcooked.  I would have liked a bit more "sauce" as the dish was a bit dry. Service was excellent.  My iced tea was refilled without asking throughout our meal. Of course, spending and evening with Ayesha over spicy food as we both wiped our noses from the heat of curry can't be beat!

So, for work, our event today was at the Phoenix Art Museum and we all met for lunch before heading to No Festival Required. Our table was ready - set for a group of 20.  Luckily, we only had a dozen people.  The table wouldn't have been able to comfortably equip 20, but was great for 12.  Just not enough space for the larger reservation we had made. I had read the reviews first to see what kind of menu they had. I opted for the brie and fruit appetizer, along with apricot iced tea.  I'm not HUGE on apricots, but I ended up having my glass refilled twice.  It wasn't too sweet and came with a slice of lemon.  I could have drank a gallon, if not for the fact that I'd be sitting in the theater to see the short films!   What a surprise to have it come - an ENTIRE wheel of brie with some baguette toasts, 2 strawberries and 5 grapes.  Yes, that's all that came with an ENTIRE wheel of brie.  I did ask for extra toasts and got that with no extra charge.  The entree cost $11.  I think that's pretty comparable to going to the market to buy an ENTIRE wheel of brie, fruit, etc.  More fruit would have been nice, though.  I now have a HALF of a wheel of brie in the fridge for later.  :} Service was super-friendly.  Justin, our server, was great!   I'd love to come here again with my Mom on a Sunday and check out the rest of the museum.

Holy cow! I definitely want to bring some of my Asian recipes with me the next time I go to Lee Lee's! Rows upon rows of regional supplies.  Thai row.  Japanese row.  Korean row.  name it, they've got it! I loved browsing the produce aisle.  Got me some baby bok choy - one of my favorites!  Great on the grill, too! The seafood/fish selection is none like I've ever seen before.  All the freezer doors are labeled with what's inside!  You don't see that at Safeway! There were some gringo items there.   I guess I was a bit disappointed to see a T-Mobile kiosk as I was walking out. Didn't mind the smell.  In fact, going down each aisle, the aromas from whatever was in that aisle overcame my senses.   I was a bit overwhelmed and didn't have too much time to just browse.  Next time, I will make time to spend at least an hour here.  And, probably, take someone with me who knows a bit more of Asian/Indonesian cuisine.

I was met at the back door.  Yes, I'm your back door girl!  Parking here can be a bitch, as well as pulling into the place...but when you get there...Heaven! I got a cheese and garlic pizza to go.  I pulled into the parking lot and they said my name.  Stalker?  Nope.  Just good service, I guess.  Or maybe they know what a pain it is to park in back and walk allllllll the way around the building to get to the front door?  Anyway... This is true East Coast pizza.  Thin crust, proper sauce and amount and loads of dripping cheese.  Tons of crushed garlic, too!   My first time there, I chatted with the owner.  He actually uses Frank's for his wings!  Hey, I'm from Buffalo.  I *know* wings!  I didn't have them, but he did let me try the sauce.  Perfecto! Huge, East Coast slices, too.  The kind you have to fold in half to eat it, with grease dripping down your hand to your elbow.  THIS is what pizza is supposed to be!!!

Man, I love Cold Stone!  Sorry you had a bad experience, Jennifer L. Nothing like cake better-flavored ice cream with caramel sauce and peanut butter cups mashed in! I think it's a bit pricey, but you also get what you pay for.  The quality of ice cream is really good.   The cones are always fresh (mmmmmmmm waffle cone!) and you can take a taste of any flavor ice cream you want.

Five bucks.  A burger, fries and can of pop.  How can you go wrong? I had the Guac burger.  It's the reason I took a star away.  The burger itself was great, but the guac?  Notsomuch.  They do have a good array of different toppings to choose from.   The fries were shoestring-cut and had a spiced salt sprinkled on them.  It was a good-sized serving.   I love a can of pop!  They have Shasta, which is two thumbs up for me.  It doesn't have NutraSweet in the diet, but Splenda.  Hooray! Getting out of this place is a bitch so here's my secret: Go out the back way, through the car wash to get to 7th Street.  Traffic on Indian School, right at the 7th Street light, sucks moose balls.

When you're a big deal like me, you get invited to private gatherings at restaurants. Heh.  I was there with several other people in the marketing/social media world. It was invite-only, so be very jealous! *I did not pay for anything other than drinks/tips, so keep that in mind. I got to taste some new and changed dishes from the menu to help them decide on new options for the general public (people like you, not me. Haha. I kill me!) One of the pasta dishes had green chiles and a white sauce. Anything with chiles in it is top in my book! It had just enough kick to make you know it was there, but not beg for more water or make haste to the bathroom. The service was friendly, and I could tell the "normal" patrons of the restaurant that night were quite happy with their experience. I have been there before, for a Yelp Elite event, but hadn't been back until last month. I WILL be back, even though it's on Mill, which is such an obnoxious place but you can't blame the business owners. Blame the college kids. Seriously. Be careful where you park! Mill Ave seems to change places that are free or that charge, so be on the lookout for free places on a side street.  The General Manger, Katie, was there and asking for suggestions. She even emailed me back within 24 hours. THAT is service. I wish everyone did that. Though, if they did, then places like this wouldn't stand out for their customer relations. Feel free to drop my name. No, don't. I mean, they should remember me, but you don't want to look pretentious by saying you know me, right?

Ok, plan to spend over an hour here.  Seriously.  There is WAY too much to look at!   I first met the owner, Anna Marie, at the Melrose Street Fair.  I shot my mouth off about being a comedian and got sucked into ShopDevious.com world! Holy frijoles! Want a funky, party wig?  Got it!  Sexy stockings?  Got it!   Upscale beauty shop.  Internet cafe!  Resale!  DKNY, BCBG, Bebe and more! Their wig designer even won the Arizoni Award for Theater Excellence. This is just a really cool place (might I say: FABULOUS!) and they do good things in the community like collect old cell phones. You even get a discount for bringing in a reusable bag!  Too cool! I could rave forever. Just go there.  It's fun!

I don't think I could even *try* to give less than 5 stars! I just started a new job last week and noticed my co-workers eating delicious-looking sandwiches.  I, being the "new kid", wasn't invited.  So, today, I went by myself.   Walking in, I was reminded of delis back East.  They were either speaking Polish or German.  I think Polish.  Sweet, short, older women behind the counter, calling me "honey" and "darling".  I love that! So, I know what the reubens look like, as the guy who didn't invite me last week had one that looked awesome.  I opted for a BLT with avocado.  You can order it with either a 1/4 or half an avocado!  I'm big on the fruit, so I got a 1/2.  They even have 9 grain bread!!!!!! There are two small tables outside for people to eat on and about a dozen inside.  Really clean place, too.   Service was QUICK!  I only sent out two text messages while waiting.  I also got a side of potato salad.  It was soooooooooooo good with a nice "tang" to it. They also have a stamp-card.  I limit myself to a max of 2 lunches out a week (gotta save money since I waste my pacheck on gas these days!) but it will only take me a month to fill it up and get a free lunch :}

So, I was the only whitey in the place!  Went for a comedy show last night.  I had NO idea it was a dance club!  They had really beautiful decor - nice, comfy booths everywhere.  To the right when you walk in is a raised section lined with booths.  In front of the stage were more sections of booths with sleek, square table in front of them. They even had a booth lining the back wall on the stage.  I'm thinking this may be a perfect place for a comedy roast! The staff was friendly and (from what I hear) awesome drink specials. This place is really classy and I will be sure to dress more appropriately for my next visit.  And get the Fake Bake out!  Teehee!

I've gotten both my arms done by Josh.  He just moved to Lady Luck about a year ago. The decor is awesome!  Very chic and contemporary.  The place is as clean as a whistle.   I've spent about 20 hours at Lady Luck.  Everyone is really friendly and professional.  They even play movies while you're sitting in the chair to pass the time.  It's great!   When you've spent as much time as I have, you need something to stare at besides Josh!

I have forever banned Wendy's because of the square burger.  I think it's weird.  Maizie's changed that for me tonight. Went with Julia, Ayesha, Georgie and some guy Julia works with.  See, it's $3 burger night!  I'll put aside my disdain for the square burger. I got the house burger, which came with a side of fries.  Burger was H U G E huge!  That's OK.  I was H U N G R Y hungry!  It had lettuce and a slice of tomato on it, along with some slices of purple onion.  Served on Thick bread, like a ciabatta.  The fries still had the skin on them - my fave!  Lights dusted with some salt that had a bit of kick to it. I love that they also have Pellegrino.  I love sparkling water.  It makes me burp, which is what I *really* needed after that big, square burger!

There is nothing like walking into El Pollo Loco and actually seeing the chickens grilling in back.  The smell hits you as soon as you walk in the place.  I guess it makes me feel good to see "fast food" actually taking its time cooking. I love the chicken bowls.  I always substitute the pinto beans for the BBQ black beans.  YUMMY! And, if you so desire, you can order tortillas on the side and they give you a choice of corn or flour.  Both are really good!  Chewy, stretchy and don't fall apart when you use them to eat. The restaurants are always clean and well-kept.  I've been to a few different locations.

I'm pretty disappointed in myself for not reviewing 24 Carrots.  Every time I've gone, I've had the best service! The employees already know my name, they make suggestions from the menu, and make sure you're happy. They like to experiment in the kitchen (as opposed to me, in the bedroom) and will bring out things they are working on. Beet Balls. Cake Balls. Yeah, they make a lot of balls. Score! The last time I went, I had the grilled cheese. To die for!!!! This is a vegetarian restaurant, with vegan options. You can get regular cheese if you want. I always get a blueberry smoothie. Large. Yummy & good for the kidney! Bring your laptop, as there is free wifi. There is no more perfect place to work. Believe me.

First thing I always do is head right to the end of the produce aisle, where there are a few bins of 50% off products.  Same goes for the end of Aisle 3.  I love F & E bean and cheese burritos. HUGE and I can make two meals out of them.  They have pizzas with different gourmet toppings.  Many pre-made dinners, too.  I like that there aren't a million different brands of cat food.  Just a few.  That's why I like this store so much: it's got the basics with a few inordinaries.   I like the big bag of wasabi almonds.  It helps me to make friends at work. As a child of a recovering hippie, the packaging sometimes bothers me.  Do potatoes in pairs *really* need to be shrink-wrapped?   Produce aisle is great.  Always good sales.  Got a whole seedless watermelon today for $1.98.

Went here for Hair Wars on Sunday night.  The DJs were awesome and played such a wide range of music!  Staff was super-friendly. Didn't see Cary Hart, which was a bummer.  I mean, he's single now, and I love the color pink, soooo.....

I go here once a week or so for a big pop for lunch.  The place is super-clean and the staff is really friendly.  Today, I had to get two drinks - one for me and one for Jenni at work.  Got one free.  They must love me or know I got game. The thing I HATE HATE HATE though is the parking.  I almost get hit just about everytime by people pulling away from the pumps and not watching where they're going.  There's just not a ton of room to park in front of the store and avoid the idiots leaving the pumps.

So, I finally had a pupusa!  I was at Art Walk in the 'Slope tonight and arrived starving.  I knew I was going to come here for a pupusa. The food is cheap!  I got a bean and cheese pupusa and a bean tamale and spent I think $6.  My tamale wasn't quite heated up.  It wasn't fridge-cold, but nearly.  The pupusa was really rich and loaded with filling.  I was really full by the time I finished my meal. I'll be back again because Dottsy got a shrimp one and I had a bite and it was yummy!   It was nice talking to the owner.  They're from El Salvador and I spent time in Central America going to college.  It was nice hearing the Central American accent, since I'm surrounded by the Mexican dialect here.  Made me miss the warm sandy beaches of Costa Rica.

If you have a longish lunch hour, go.  I went around 5pm tonight and there was nobody in front of me.  Took me 5 minutes to get my fish burrito (Thanks to Chris T for the recommendation!) It was HUGE and came with a little cup of two salsas: green and red.  I cut it in half to enjoy the salsas separately.   Filled to the brim with rice, cheese, beans and the fish and smothered in some sort of sauce, it was delicious!   Service was super-friendly and everyone had a smile on their face and said "Amy, your fish burrito is ready!"  I mean, the personalized service was great.  Maybe hitting them at a slow hour was what did it.  There is a little retail spot where you can get incense (they're hippies, get it???) and posters on the wall to peruse while waiting.  I took mine home, but the patio is lovely.  There's even a vintage bike parked out front with little baskets filled with potted plants.  How adorable is that????

OMG can you find the wet spot? A girl at work brought in 4 cupcakes this morning for Jenni and I.  Jenni was given the role of cutting them in half for the two of us to try each one. The first was a red velvet.  The cream cheese frosting actually tasted like cream cheese.  Rich but not *too* rich.  The cake was moist and fell apart as soon as the wrapping came off.  I mean, if you can't get a little dirty while eating a cupcake, what's the point??? The second was coconut.  Jenni cut this one a little lop-sided because her favorite is coconut.  Whatever!  The cake was white and very moist also.  I like that there isn't too much frosting.  The top was sprinkled with coconut.  Yummy! Ah, the chocolate.  The frosting had very chocolaty flavor.  Like fresh cocoa powder or something.  The cake was also chocolate and really moist, like the rest. Finally, the white cupcake.  It was OK.  The frosting tasted like...frosting.  Again, the white cake was super moist.   WAY better than Sprinkles!!!!  If you're in NoSco, screw the lines at Sprinkles.  Go to Scottsdale Bakery and Cupcake Company! And pick me up another red velvet.  Jenni's lopsided half-cut isn't fair on my part.

Ok, most people hate going to the laundromat to do their laundry.  I have no choice but actually like coming here. This place is super-clean with a friendly staff (mostly Spanish-speaking but I'm fluent so THERE :P).  There are *no* pigeons running around this place.  Always a plus! You use a card here, no quarters dug from under the couch cushions.  I like that.   The place is spotless.  There's always someone cleaning up.  The machines are regularly cleaned out of forgotten socks and panties. They even have a little store with a variety of different detergents!   They are open late, which seems to be when I go there.  Many TVs throughout, tuned into different stations.  There's even a PacMan machine to play!

So, had a few hours to kill before a gig tonight.  I was already on this side of town and figured I'd stop in.  They do comedy here once a month and I'm glad I finally checked the place out! All I had was iced tea, but the review is about the service.   Free wifi.  They print the password on your receipt.  Genius!  That's how they get people to NOT just go and use their wifi.  I'm cool with that.   The place is gorgeous and as I was leaving, there was an acoustic set going on. Two thumbs up, Wayne.

When I see a burger on the menu with bleu cheese, I pretty much cream myself. (That's a GREAT detail if you want to take me out on a date, boys.) The service was spot-on and we never had to ask for a drink refill.  The size of the burger was enormous and I didn't get to finish the whole thing. I LOVE that they serve the fries in a cone-shaped dish. Keeps the grease at the bottom. There are a LOT of combos you can make a burger with. Ordering is like Chino Bandido, where you can decide which toppings, what kind of bread for the bun, etc. I've only been to this location, but the owner was there and super attentive to us, so I would frequent any location of theirs. There was a table near us of people that kept making faces about our conversation. It wasn't even inappropriate but they were so mean looking that I almost got up to shove a fry up their noses.  My only complaint was the temperature of the restaurant. It was really cold in there. It was about a month or so ago, so it could have been that in-between part of Phoenix weather when you aren't sure if you should have the A/C on or the heat.  I'll definitely be back, because I love me some big meat!

I was part of Desert Bloom a few weeks ago and it was my first time at the new Gangplank location.  Though I don't know what it looks like during working hours (the room was cleared for painting and such), it's an awesome space.   I have a lot of friends who go to Gangplank to work and it's just such a cool concept all-around!  I don't get out to this part of the Valley very often, but I would definitely consider business meetings here.

Hint: Park on Coral Gables and start hiking from there, off 7th Street. This is my favorite hike in Phoenix! No crowds and there is always parking. There are several different trails to choose from, so you could go for a quick 20-minute hike or 90 minutes. The climb to the top is pretty fun because you also have to use your hands. I've seen people rock climb here, too, which is cool. I like bouldering when I get the chance.

This is for Deb: I drove to the box that talks back.  I ordered a Quarter Pounder with cheese meal.  With a Diet Coke.  Yeah, I drink Diet.  Not because I think it will even out the bad of the meal, simply because that's what I drink. I got my food quickly.  I barely remember eating it and gave the last few bites of my burger to the dog, along with a few fries.  The fries were good. The ice in my cup was really, really cold.

One thing I miss as an East Coast transplant is a good fish fry.  Went there today with Jacqui and Dave.  Service was quick and friendly, but not overly so. The fish fry was perfect!  Not too much batter on the fish and it was perfectly crisp.  If you've ever had fried fish with so much batter that it doesn't all get cooked and you're left with soggy batter then you know what I'm talking about. Regular steak fries.  Great atmosphere. OH and they do comedy on Mondays.  I'll be performing Monday November 9th :}

These are my peeps.  I am here at least once a week, mostly on Twitter Tuesdays.  I am the Mayor of this Mojo Yogurt location.  No, I didn't get a freaking parade.  On Twitter Tuesdays, they announce the "word of the day," which gives you half off.  HALF OFF.  That's marketing, people. Though I will try different flavors of yogurt, I love the coconut and the acai.  My toppings are always always always mochi and strawberries.  If you don't know what mochi is, get some culture in you.  This is actually just part of mochi, but it's really good and I love the chewiness.  (I can't believe that chewiness is really a word and didn't show up with a red line!) Anyway, the customer service here is stellar.  I never use that word because I think it's WAY overused, but it works in this case.   They know my name here.  Well, I tell them all the time.  Because I'm the MAYOR.  (I wouldn't brag about it so much if Amber didn't brag about being Mayor of Dunkin' Donuts! ;} )

After dropping $100 at the nursery this morning for my new patio, I needed something for breakfast and a nice iced tea.  My neighbors told me about Luci's and I've driven by a half dozen times. You can build an omelet there by the size: Eeny (just egg), Meeny (egg and cheese), Miny (egg, cheese and veggies), and Moe (all the above with a protein).  I had a piece of spinach quiche.  I also ordered a large iced tea.  Well, I was sipping my tea, waiting for the quiche to be heated.  And waited.  Finally, after bumping into my massage therapist (she's the BEST!), I asked about it.  They had forgotten me.  :{  Oh well, they offered a free Danish to make up for it while they heated up my quiche.   They have a section of teas and different foods.  It's a small section and the prices are a little higher than you'd find at Sprouts. I'll be back a million times, since it's so close to home. Let's hope they don't forget me next time ;}

If it weren't for Twitter, I'm not sure I would have known about Sutra!  They had posted a special - Twitter peeps got $10 for their first class, taken that day.  I've been doing yoga for over 10 years and I'm always looking for something new.  I did the Rhythmic Flow yoga, after informing them I had NO rhythm.  I am a rhythmtard.  I thought I was going to have to dance.  I went anyway. This place is sooooo cool!  The design is industrial-retro.  Big, steel doors enclose each studio.   The rhythmic class I would describe as more of a power yoga than just a regular flow class.  It kicked my ass!  The instructor was great!  There were only two of us in class, so it was nice to get more attention.   I like that there was music playing that's not the typical yoga music.  It was stuff most of us would know.  Not that kind that can put you to sleep. I left there a dripping mess, but had a GREAT workout!  They have a lot of daily and weekly specials.  There's one this month, but I'm gone a lot and can't take advantage.   GO!

Today was my first time here.  Yes, I know, I am a Big AL(big-ass loser.  You'd know this if you've ever taught middle/high school).  Anyway, I was meeting up with Tony, aka Lightrailblog for a late lunch.  I knew I wanted the elote.  I've been hearing everyone scream about the damn elote for months.  I started out with an iced tea (I am an iced tea FREAK!) that was flavored - I think mango.  Then I got an Arnold Palmer.  This was the BEST AP I've EVER had!  (Sorry, FEZ!)  It was made with freshly-squeezed lemonade and was plenty tart.  I also had huevos ranchers.  I like that they asked how I wanted my eggs cooked.  I HATE fully-cooked yolks.  Unless it's a hard-boiled egg, then it kinda has to be that way.  Came with a side of refried beans.  The salsa on top was awesome and not store-bought.   Server, Steven ("Esteban") was awesome...as soon as he figured out that everything I said was a joke. I mean, come on, am I *really* gonna put my ice cubes on your nipples?  Well, not in public, and not until you buy me dinner.  HA! Downfall:  THE FLIES!!!!  There were at least 4 flying around our table.  *shudder*

These guys earned an extra star *just* for the 10% discount if you ride your bike there.  How awesome is that? There is a TON of seating outside.  It reminds me of the restaurants on the beaches in Costa Rica, where the majority of tables are outside.  There is seating inside, but in Phoenix, in March, you really shouldn't sit inside.  That's such a sad, sad waste. They have a great menu for breakfasts and lunch.  I had a veggie sandwich that was big enough that I had to bring half home to eat later.   Service was really friendly, from the host to the waitress. I love that this place is a big, old house.  While I was sitting there eating, I was imagining living there, in old school Phoenix.  Pretty cool.

Yeah, it took me this long to get to The Parlor.  I can walk to it.  All my friends have gone a gazillion times.  Whatever, I'm busy. There was a group of 8 with a crapload of kids in front of us, waiting for the rest of their party to arrive.  I let the hostess know that I'd sit anywhere...except nowhere near them.  Ha!  She put us on the patio. I love patio heaters.  They are necessary in the winters here and the patio was really cozy and warm.  Not overbearing, juuuuuuuust right. I had a pasta dish with seafood and a spicy red sauce.  I like that the meals come in two sizes, as leftovers don't work very well with shrimp.  It gets rubbery.  Blech.  It will rot in my fridge next to the broccoli.   The service was spot-on, as I never had to ask for a refill on my drink.  Really nice guy.  Cute, too. The prices were great, even though I didn't have to pay.   I love valet service, too.  Didn't have to pay for that, either.

I know that every time I walk here with Dexter, I will be met with a very robust greeting. I think the employees drink coffee. A lot of coffee. They are bouncy, but not obnoxious. They're just...happy. Every drink I've had there is great! I mostly get an Americano on my morning walks. I've had a caramel drink there, too. They always give Dexter a biscuit, which is a nice touch. I love their Social Media presence, too. They respond to pictures. I like that.

Not only is this in the coolest strip in CenPho (next to Stinkweeds, frances and Halo), but I was in a time warp as soon as I entered.  I went to a writing workshop here tonight and the table was covered with a gazillion different types of candies.  I kept reaching for one, then another, either shouting out loud on just in my head the name of the candy, because I hadn't seen it in years. As I  browsed the candy for our writing assignment, my heart was filled with nostalgia.  Fun Dip!  I know, you can get it anywhere, but there's more.  When was the last time you saw an Aero bar?  Do you even know what it is?  Or that disgusting violet-flavored gum.  One of my mom's boyfriends chewed that crap.   There are also novelty items.  Do you need a bacon wallet?  How about a punching nun?  The novelty items cover a wall on one side of the store, the candy, the other.  In the middle are both, mixed together. I was even happy that the owner, Georgeanne, has a running list going of candy she's going to try to find for people.  I gave her one that I remember as a child: a mini record cover and inside was a piece of gum, shaped like a record!  The lyrics to "Heart of Glass" were written on the inside of the cover.  I hope she finds it!!!

*burp*  Cripes, this was some good food!  Pleasantly full, not like Thanksgiving.  I just HAD to have the #28 noodles.  Rice noodles, with mock pork, and egg roll on top, bean sprouts, lettuce, cucumbers and peanuts.  The bowl was HUGE!!!!!!!!!!! I went with Robert M. and Bacon and they had gotten there before me and had a couple appetizers ordered already.  Two different kinds of spring rolls: shrimp and pork.  This is a vegetarian restaurant, so all the meat was "mock."  Each order had two huge rolls, enough food for the three of us to split. The boys got the #41 - soy chicken speared with lemongrass and a tofu dish.  Everything was delicious! Then, the boba.  I've been a fan of boba forever and am soooooo glad there's a place in CenPho that has it!  Robert and I got the taro and coconut smoothies, with boba.  Bacon had the Chai with boba.  We also got to taste the avocado.  Soooooooo good, I will dream of it more than my last date.  That wasn't even worthy of a nightmare, it was so uneventful. The owner was awesome and took his time to answer questions and explain the dishes and how to eat them.  Did you know that the Buddhist monks do not eat garlic or onions?  It's because they make you horny, and that's not good for monks.  Maybe I should cut those out of my diet, too. Boba.  The drink you can eat!

When I donated my kidney a few months ago, Wendy from Petite Maison brought me 6 pints of soup. At the time, I had never met her, the chef or eaten there. How cool is that? After being on painkillers for several days, I was severely constipated. It happens. The lentil soup she brought over did the *ahem* trick, though! I finally got to go there last weekend for their late night Staff Meal, which was dessert-themed. My friend Leslie made all the desserts.  The service was great, except for having to ask for water twice. There weren't many people there, but it was also after hours, so I'll forgive it because it was such a cute place! It feels like a ski lodge inside. There is wood everywhere! Cute chandeliers over the tables, too.  Oh, and the bathroom was nice. Not too fancy, but nicer than most places. I will definitely come back here for a regular meal, but I wanted to get the word out about this place. Good people, who care about others in the community. Great atmosphere and for being in Old Town, douchebag-free.

I went here the first time about 18 months ago with a gift certificate. I've been back about a dozen times since then! It took about 6 different therapists for me to finally settle on Vince. Vince is a New Yorker. Vince beats the crap out of my knots. Vince leaves me sore for a couple of days. In short, he does what I need to do. The staff here is super friendly, too. They always ask something personal, like about my comedy or my sunglasses. See, I had a pair of Gucci sunglasses that I lost the other day and they just happened to call and confirm my appointment as I was tearing my house apart trying to look for them. I told them what I was doing, and she said "Oh no! You love those things!" It's this kind of service that keeps me going back. Now, I have to divulge that I am in a network with these guys and I don't pay cash for my massages. BUT, their prices are just fine for what you get. AND THEY HAVE COOKIES!!!  My ONLY issue is that they can't use essential oils in the rooms, because some people may have allergies. I like a good lavender rub-down. I wish I could walk out of there smelling relaxed.

I have a new massage therapist here, since mine is no longer there. His name is Grayson and he's great for deep tissue massage! I'm still disappointed that essential oils can't be used here.  Love the homemade cookies in the waiting room. The staff takes turns making them, and I think that's a lovely touch.

I am a Two Hippies groupie.  The owner and I are from Buffalo, so it's nice to see the Flutie jersey and memorablia from back home. Starving, after being sick for 4 days, I texted Tony A (@lightrailblog) to meet me for breakfast.  We toyed for a few momets, via text, on where to go.  I hadn't tried this place yet.  I used to live across the street from it and waited, with much anticipation, for it to open.  I waited for three months and finally got to go. Same type of ordering structure as the Beach House and Mushroom Burger places. I chose the bread pudding, fried pickles and of course a breakfast bowl.  You get 3 scrambled eggs and up to 6 toppings of your choice.  All is served over potatoes.  I chose sun-dried tomatoes, spinach, green onions, roasted garlic and monterey jack cheese. Our drinks and bread pudding were ready right away, so we dug in.   The bread pudding was really good, moist, and came with a side of icing.  Perfect starter (or dessert) for breakfast! Our bowls took about 15 minutes.  I knew there would be a wait, because everything was cooked to order.  The place was packed, but at least I had my bread pudding to munch on.  When the dill pickles and bowls were ready, we pigged the F out!   The toast was butter and chewy.  You could tell it was grilled.  Asked for ranch for my pickles and you could tell it was homemade ranch.  This wasn't Hidden Valley Ranch, no siree bob! I'm stuffed.  I have the leftovers in my fridge and can't wait to dig in later. Minus one star for the potatoes.  Not the best; not the worst.  I will definitely be back again, especially since there were hot firemen to stare at during my meal. Two Hippies Breakfast Joint FTW!!!

I have to say that the staff did a wonderful job taking care of a table of 8.  I had wanted a reservation for 7pm, but was told I couldn't get it until 7:15.  No big deal.  Got there just a little after 7 and the table was already ready for us. Our server, Jennifer, was great.  I didn't have to ask for a refill for my iced tea more than once and that glass was kept full all night. I like that I wasn't familiar with everything on the menu.  Hula's is definitely a different cuisine than we have here in the PHX.  WTF is a Johnny cake???  Good thing someone in our party asked and ordered it.  I mean, who wants to go to dinner with people who have no food adventure??? I had the shrimp and coconut egg rolls.  A little greasy, but still had tons of flavor.  I also got the fish cakes.  They had a good kick to them and I was full with just the two appetizers I ordered. We went for a friend's birthday, and I was told that they give the birthday person a little dessert with a candle in it.  Jennifer said "We do it for everyone."  I wasn't expecting to be charged for it, though.  Not that I'll be broke the rest of the week, but I guess I had figured it was complimentary. One bizarre thing happened, though.  The other large party sitting near us must have been a bit warm, because they asked their server to prop open the side door to get some air.  It felt good at first.  We noticed the door was propped open with a silverware setting.  You know, the napkin with the knife and fork inside it.  Stuck in the door.  I asked our server after a few moments to close it and guess what?  I called it.  She put the rolled silverware back on the empty table next to us.   It was a really nice night and the ambience was comfortable.  I'll be back again to try something new.  I'll just inspect my napkin first, for any door-grease marks.

Once again, a great meal at Hula's! We got there at Happy Hour time, so it was a little chaotic, but we were seating in about 5 minutes.  The staff there is always super friendly and we were lucky that Dana came and said hi. He's an owner who "gets it" when it comes to responding to customers, as he did after my first review. The Jamaican Jerk Chicken Plate was uh-mazing! When it arrived and I saw the portion of chicken, I almost asked if they had made a mistake. It was a HUGE pile of jerk chicken! The dish also came with Johnny Cakes. Corn cakes with spices and fruit? Yes, please! Fried plantains are also one of my favorites and theirs were perfect! The right amount of crispy on the edges and sweet and and and foodgasm!  This place is always busy when I drive by. Know what that says? Just another great spot to eat in CenPho!  Thanks, Dana!

For my birthday every year, my parents come down from Payson to take me to lunch. We try to coordinate where to meet, and since I have a client in Gilbert, my boyfriend suggested this. Oh, and they wanted to go to Winco right after, so this seemed like a good spot. I had never in my life heard of the place. Sometimes, that's a good thing. Today, though, it wasn't. Turns out, it's just a huge room with an even bigger menu. I chose the Cobb salad.  Now, let me make one thing clear: If I am going to have a salad, I always get a Cobb salad. The Vig Uptown has my favorite one. I *know* a Cobb salad. The menu said it came with feta. F. E. T. A. on a Cobb salad. I asked the waitress to substitute the feta for blue cheese, remove the bacon (I knew it wouldn't be real bacon, and I hate bacon bits), and keep the dressing on the side. It also came with "turkey." Never in my life have I sent anything back to a kitchen. Ever. But there was no way I was going to let this pass. I've seen enough Kitchen Nightmares to know that Gordon would have told the server to have the chef eat that salad, just to see how horrible their food was. And that's exactly what I told her. The "turkey" were a bunch of cubes of white stuff on my plate, that had obviously been frozen, and had as much flavor as the iceberg lettuce. There were chopped tomatoes all over the place, and my "cucumber" was a tiny slice off the end of the cucumber. (see photo) She offered to bring me something else, and I declined. I didn't even want the free *$&#*$&# pizookie, that's how angry and disappointed I was. They took the "Cobb salad" off our bill, and we went on our merry way.  My stomach was rumbling on my way home. I fear it's going to be a looooooooooong night. From a salad. The worst salad in all the land. I will never, ever eat at any location of this hole again. I had no idea it was a chain, or I would have picked something else. I've never cried during a birthday lunch with my parents, but I was mighty close today.

I've been here twice in the past month and will definitely be back. It's GeekVille. I mean, I was waiting for my date to show up and heard all about how Batman came to be or something like that. AND I heard people talking about Dungeons and Dragons. (Which was one of the causes for my divorce, but I don't hold it against other people, just my ex-husband.) There are a bunch of tables outside and two different rooms inside. One is set up like the computer lab in high school. Lots of laptops here! I love their iced tea. I get it every time. I know it sounds lame to include iced tea in a review, but I like it. I don't get the fancy schmancy flavored kind, either. I'm a purist, I guess. Staff is super friendly, too.  You need to ask them for the key to the bathroom, as it's outside, off the patio. They're really clean, too. On weekends, it's open 24 hours!!!!!!

I came for the Sweet Republic.  I also left with toilet paper.  That I paid $2.95 for 4 rolls.  Ok, it's recycled, but still. It's a really cute setting and mighty cozy.  The produce section has great variety and even a good section of herbs. I think this place will be a "treat" for me to shop in, because of the prices.  I'll be comparing what I spent on the toilet paper to the recycled stuff at TJ's and we'll see if it's comparable. I want to see it thrive!  The prices are what will keep some people away, I'm afraid.

This place is random.  R A N D O M random.  I don't "get" it. Went for lunch, while taking a break from medical testing at the Mayo Clinic.  This place was empty.  Ok, there were a half dozen other people there, but it barely counts with the size of the place. Now, I like that there is a stage (guess who thought of doing comedy there???!!!) and that they have live music that promotes local bands.  I am all for that.  But, there comes a point when you can't have the place seem too classy for that sort of thing.  Framed pictures of different musical icons are nice, but overplayed.  Everywhere else.   It just doesn't work here at Compound Grill. I had the fish n chips for lunch.  5 nuggets of fish places over a bowl of fries that weren't anything special.  When will people stop serving shoestring fries????  It was cool that everything was served in a bowl made from an old record that had been warped into...the shape of a bowl, though.   Service was friendly and attentive.  The manager or owner or whoever he was also present.  I'm guessing because they though there would be a lunch rush. For this area, in N Phoenix, so close to the 101/51 and N Scottsdale, I would expect a bigger lunch crowd.  Without it, I guess shows I'm not the first person to just find the place "meh."

I live right next door to Retro Redux.  I love this place!  Everyone who works there is so damn friendly!  I chat for a fairly long time while making purchases.  In fact, it's on my agenda for tomorrow.  I've been collecting little things here and there for when I buy a condo downtown before the light rail shoots up property values.   Last time, I got the most awesome hanging lamp.  Also, a couple orange vases and a vintage ashtray.  When my sister comes to visit from the OC (there's no flavor there!) she always wants to go to Redux!

Chai!  After days of thinking about it, I finally had chai.  I feel really guilty that I hadn't been here before, since I can literally walk here.   Comfy couches, lots of tables!  One even had a gigantic checkers game on it.   Three huge video screens on the wall.  I'm not sure what mood the owner was in last night, but it was all Madonna (yeah, bitches!), Shakira and Britney videos.  OMG she did a remake of "I Love Rock n Roll" which really pisses me off.  *grumble* Anyway, they have a pretty big menu.  Their hours are awesome:  They're open till midnight during the week and 24/7 on weekends.   FTW!  Now I know I have somewhere to go late at night for a hunk of cheesecake. This place needs some decor.  I mean, the pointsettia was nice and all, but what happens after Xmas?  Walls are bare except for the screens playing girl-pop.   They make all their own desserts (except for the muffins) and have a large coffee/tea menu.   I'll be back.  If I see that Britney video again, though, I will slay kittens.

Even though it took us 2 hours to get seated (no fault of FnB, Joel L NEEDED to sit by the window!), I had an awesome time here last night. See, I get teased a lot for never leaving CenPho.  In fact, Lara asked me "Are you ever allowed to get out?" so I knew it was time to finally check this place out. I'd been in touch with Pavle for a couple days.  He's adorable!!  Had to meet him. They have late night eats, which is $10 plates after 10pm.  Score!!!  They had two choices last night: brisket and chilaquiles for the vegetarians.  Once we were seated, it only took about 10 minutes to get our food.  We were served a small veggie platter to tide us over.  There were these little garlic pickles that were to die for!  Kirti even asked for a little extra of these and they were devoured instantly. The place was PACKED.  They were out of the brisket, but seemed to come up with two servings for my dining companions. I had the chilaquiles.  Holy cripes!  They were delicious and came with an egg on top.  I loooooooooooooove eggs.  So much so that I want to marry an egg.  Not Humpty Dumpty, because I'm little, but maybe he has a little cousin or something. Anyway, the service was unbelievable.  They made me some lime drink concoction (non-alcoholic).  I had 3 of them!  Chunks of lime, lots of ice.  Sooooo delicious, especially for a warm summer night. Sitting by the window was the BEST.  Watching the drunk Scottsdale girls stumbling around Old Town made the wait worthwhile.  Watching them park?  Priceless. I ran into a lot of CenPho Escapees there, too.  What does this mean?  That it's ok to venture to Old Town, but *only* for FnB. Thank you so much, Pavle, for an amazing night.  And thanks to my friends, for making me feel guilt-free about leaving my 'hood.

I'm in love with Ambur.  There.  I said it. Her new salon uses all organic products - from the shampoo to the styling aids and hair color.  I've known her for a couple of years and was so excited to see that she was branching off on her own.  She's such a little thing and it's such a big girl move!   The salon is ecclectic.  She has local artists' works adorning the walls and changes the art every couple of months.  You can even sell that or your jewelry there!  The walls are all different, too.  The accent wall is actually paint and LACE.  Who thinks this shit up?  Ambur! Ambur's an artist.  I walked in, told her my future plans for my hair color and let her go at it for the cut and style.  That's what a good hair stylist does.   Everyone there is really friendly.  They even have free wifi!!  FTW!!!!!

It's the middle of January and 75 degrees out.  While there's no shortage of things to do outside, there aren't many dog-friendly places for that where you can sit down and eat. Jacqui J and I took out doggies to the dog park.  They're bruthas, you see, and hadn't hung out in awhile.  We had MLK day off together and spend the afternoon together.  Trying to decide where to eat with the pooches, I thought of TMI because I had seen so many people recently check in on Yelp.   Their patio is pretty big and mostly shaded.  This wasn't a day to be too concerned about shade, since it wasn't hot out.  I read the reviews ahead of time and already knew what I wanted before I even got there.  I was happy to have to take home a doggie bag, too.   I got the olives, red goat salad and the mac and cheese.  I will eat anything that includes green chiles in it.  Anything.  A few varieties of olives were served wtih fresh herbs and a dash an oil & vinegar.  I love all olives and don't always buy them for home, so it was a real treat.  They came in a little bowl, but there were about 20 of them.  The red goat salad was perfect: tons of pistachios on it, big chunks of goat cheese and strawberries. And den...and den...the mac and cheese, generously stuffed with chopped green chiles, ooey-gooey melted cheese that was crusty on the edges, the way it's supposed to be. I'll be back with Dexter.  They gave him a treat.  Oh, and my meal was treat.  I'm burping up the leftovers as I type this.

I've always been a fan of Pita Jungle, but this location takes the cake for service! I call before I leave the office to get an order to go.  They tell me 15 minutes.  When I arrive 15 minutes later, my order is ready!   The service here is always friendly and they know my name.  The place is clean, too. The back patio is huge and they have free wifi.  There's even a small bar outside, looking in.  I've never seen it completely empty.  So glad we finally have a Pita Jungle in CenPho!!!

I. Love. Their. Horchata. It's the best I've ever had. Their tacos are decent, but not to the point that I rave like everyone else.  I'm so glad they are still in this location. I lived in Melrose for 4 years and saw 3 different restaurants in that building in that time. It's like cursed or something. Maybe it WAS cursed until America moved in? Wouldn't that be crazy? Anyway, the staff is friendly. I do think the portions are a bit small for the price, but she's got a following and can charge a bit more. I love riding my bike here, pounding down some tacos and horchata, then pedaling back home for a food come nap.

This listing definitely needs to be updated, because the hotel is now a Renaissance.   I had a business lunch here today and it was amazing!!! The daily special was a short rib sandwich with roasted tomatoes and blue cheese. Whenever I see "blue cheese" with meat, I'm on board. You can get a half sandwich and a cup of soup, or a whole sandwich and a side of fries. I opted for the latter.  I love love love when I see fries come in a cup with brown paper. I don't know why. It's just one of my "things." The fries were perfect and had good chunks of salt on them. But the sandwich...oh the sandwich! The bun was perfect. Crispy on the edges, chewy in the middle. The portion of pork was enough that pieces kept falling out. The rib meat was juicy and tender. There was enough blue cheese for flavor, but not enough to overpower the meat. It also came with some jus on the side. We had Rhonda serve us, who is also the main squeeze of the place. She works in the main bar in the lobby, but she's been there forever. The hotel itself has gone through a lot of changes, but Rhonda is always there. If you're looking for a nice vibe for a lunch Downtown, or a great place for a business meeting, you must check out Marston's.

I'm still trying to figure out why anyone would drive all the way from Provo Utah to eat here. Very little in the fresh fruit options for toppings.  Mojo Yogurt has WAY more.  Not everyone wants M&Ms on their yogurt. Price???????  I wonder how much they charge per ounce!  I've never paid more than $4 for a fro-yo, with toppings.  It was almost twice as much here.   I won't be back.  What a rip.

This is my 300th review. The end. Hahahaha, just kidding. Well, it *is* my 300th, but I'm actually going to write something. I met my boss here for a dinner meeting. I can walk to this place, but had never been. I know, I'm late to the Vig trend, but when it comes to trendy places, I bush the system somewhat. We needed to find someplace that  had gluten-free options and a lot of people suggested The Vig Uptown. It's WAY bigger inside than you'd think at first. Oh, everyone has to valet and it's free. You go in through a huge orange door (I really like orange. I hate yellow, though.) and can pretty much pick a place to sit unless it's really packed. Luckily, it was a Wednesday night and there were quite a few tables available.  We sat in back next to the bocce ball thing. Is it a court? What would it be called? It's just a long strip of green. Whatever. The music was a bit too loud to carry on a conversation. There was a guy playing the guitar. It was pretty impossible to hear half of what my boss was saying. I bet he offered me a million dollar raise & I missed it. Just my luck. I had the Cobb salad. Holy cripes! The thing was huge!!! Ok, it was $12 but still, I had to take half of it home to eat the next day. Huge chunks of bleu cheese & bacon. There wasn't too much dressing on it, either. I actually like the taste of vegetables and don't like a lot of dressing on my salads. The service was super friendly and quick to refill drinks. Oh, and the bathroom is super cool, too. The sink is one of those flat ones that makes you feel like you're going to flood the bathroom when you wash your hands. How embarrassing, because people may think you just peed a lot but it's really from the sink. Haha. That would happen to me, too, as well as missing my boss giving me a million-dollar raise.

I was really excited to try this place, but left underwhelmed. The food was great, but not worth the price.  The service was just awful. The kid serving us was on his very first serving shift. Ever. We had to flag him or the owner down to get drink refills.  They didn't even have much to offer for drinks. Either their machine was down or whatever, but I was handed a bottle of water during my meal. A plastic bottle of water. We obviously went on an off night, because my main squeeze absolutely loves this place, and it's very close to his house. Prior reviews had me excited. I was let down.  The staff was very friendly, and they have authentic food.  Next time, take out. I don't think I could deal with the frustration again.

I can't freaking believe I haven't reviewed Short Leash yet!!!!!!!   I go pretty much every Friday to the Downtown Phoenix Public Market food truck court.  Is that a mouthful or what????? I make a beeline here.  Not only are these people totally kick-ass but so are the hot dogs. I try to get a different one each time, but I always end up with the one that's got the jalapenos on it.  I don't remember the names ever.  I am there to eat, not read, but I think it's the Igby. They have a new one I learned about last night, the "Lady," and my mouth is watering right now at my desk.  I will be trying it out today for lunch. :} Oh, and when business owners remember the names of their customers, they are tops in my book.  After all, I may be eating their hot dog, but it's still....all about me.  ;}

Ain't nevah seen a rack o' ribs dat big, 'cept on a may-un I used ta date!  I performed here.  The crowd was really supportive while they gnawed on them thar ribs.  Seriously.  I left that night, thinking of those ribs. There are a lot of regulars, which means a lot to me when I go to a new place.  I've known a couple of other restaurants in that location and they never last, but I hope Dillon's does.  The service was super friendly and quick.  The menu is pretty big and I was quite surprised at that.    I'm sooooooo glad they've kept the decor from Central Grille.  I love the booths and brat-pack feel, as well as the dark walls.  There's a lot of wood, too.  That's not a pun, because most of the men were really old and, well, probably lacking in the wood department.

We had an office party here Friday for our one-year anniversary.  So, being that I didn't have to pay for the games, shoes, or food, my review is based on my experience.  Just thought I'd get that out there so nobody reams me.   We got the private room, which was really nice.  In fact, everything here was really nice: the decor, the people and, being that it's a new bowling alley, the shoes.  The shoes were still brand-new.  That's huge. We had a TON of food!  Pot stickers, pizza, veggie trays.  Everything was great and tasted fresh.  It wasn't Sysco food. The service was outstanding!  I'm not one of those people who says "outstanding" very often, but we were really taken care of well. There's a nice lounge off the main room for people who just want to...go to the bowling alley to drink.  Do people really do that???   I can't wait to get a group together to go again.  It's fun, it's Downtown and I'm excited about CityScape!

I've been a patron since the old location and now I'm happy that they are closer to me. My favorite sandwich is the Buffalo wrap. Ask for hunks of blue cheese if you get it. I'm from Buffalo, and I can tell they use Frank's.  My only complaint is the tiny portion of the side salad you get. I don't know of any other place that has such a small side. They staff is very friendly and a lot of fun. They also have a punchcard, so you get a free sandwich.

OMG get the chorizo omelet!!!  The place is cutely decorated and the service is super friendly, though a little slow. I am a booth girl, so I was happy to see that most of the seating up front was booths. I don't like tables and hate chairs. When I see biscuits and gravy on a menu, I am already in love. Also, they don't have it on the menu, but try the chorizo gravy on your biscuits. We only knew about it because Joe himself came to our table. In face, he visited a lot of patrons while we were there. The potatoes weren't anything fancy, but man oh man, that omelet was amazing. I am still thinking about it!

Chaka Chaka I love you!!!  I love hearing about fellow comics having some ambition and following a dream other than...comedy.  Charles started this place not too long ago and except for the porn place next door, it's great!  I think the neighborhood made for some good people-watching, too. Had the jerk chicken sandwich and the garlic fries.  I devoured both.  Well, I went with 3 other women in comedy and we all devoured our lunches. The server was super-friendly and prompt.  Even told him our orders and none of them got mixed up. There are only a few options on the menu, but I think it really works for Chaka Chaka. I mean, with a name like that, how can you go wrong??? Oh, and get the brownie.  GET THE BROWNIE.

Party of 6 for a birthday. Had the mac & cheese & homemade s'mores for dessert. That's right. HOMEMADE S'MORES. With a smidge of peanut butter. Fresh marshmallows. And...chocolate-covered bacon. I'm not kidding. Great service, until the end when it was time to pay and we needed separate checks. His attitude got a bit snotty, but not enough to keep me from going back.

I really have to gush about this place! I had a business meeting, and we were supposed to meet at the Merc. Their signage was completely wrong and they never opened when they said they were going to. So, we walked around the corner and saw Fuego Tacos. I've been to the Bistro once, so I knew it was a safe place to go.  It was just after 5 and the place was about half-full downstairs. I noticed the upstairs was empty. I asked if we could sit up there and we were given our choice of tables. Our server was amazing! He immediately brought us chips and salsa and took our drink orders. He brought me two drinks! I'm ok with that, because usually I'm used to having servers who don't keep up with my drinks. (Diet Coke, FYI) The chips were freshly made, and the salsa was good. We ordered a plate of nachos to share with pork on top. It's one of the best plates of nachos I've had in a very long time. We all devoured them. As I was getting up to leave, our server brought me a Diet Coke in a to-go cup. I didn't even ask for it but wow!  I'm going back, most definitely. The prices were reasonable and there was a good crowd in there.  Oh, and they were playing 80s music. That pretty much gives the place 500 cool points.

Ok, so I rarely get to Old Town to eat.  RARELY.  I'm a CenPho grrrl.  But, when Chef Bec invites you out to try stuff, you go.  Pronto!!!! Sat at the bar, since it was a Friday and I guess that's where people sit.  Went with Kirti for happy hour & just to chill.  Not only was the service great (I rarely had to ask for a refill), but the chef even came out to introduce herself.  The place wasn't too crowded yet, which was good, because that's another reason for all the attention.  Had to keep the worker bees busy!   First thing we tried was the ribs appetizer.  They were falling off the bone and had an amazingly sticky-spicy-sweet sauce on them.  Also had the crab dip, which came with plantain chips.  I loooooooooove plantain chips.  Love.   The pork tacos?  OMG.  O. M. G.  I took a couple home as leftovers and my mouth watered all night, thinking about those tacos. For dessert, we had "crack pie."  I don't even know what was in it, but the crust was nutty, there was whipped cream, and it stuck to my teeth when I ate it.  And it was made from crack.  It HAD to be!!!!!!  The red velvet cupcake was also divine, but that crack pie...*sigh* Parking is a bitch in Old Town, but there is a garage right near The Herb Box.

After a few trips to Churn, I decided it was time to try Windsor. I'd gotten a few tips from friends on what to order and everyone really enjoyed their food. Kammie K was my lunch partner. When I got there, she had a bowl of pistachios in front of her. In. The. Shell. I love that! Good food always takes a little work, right? As we munched on the nuts (hahaha I am a nut muncher!) I saw something on the menu I'd been wanting to try for a couple months: kale chips. The chips came with a ranch dipping sauce, but I only tried a little of it. They were perfect on their own! Garlic hunks and sea salt peppered each leaf perfectly. I can't wait to learn how to make them at home! I also had bite-sized corn dogs. They were pretty good & came with a side of mustard, but some of the batter didn't cook all the way on a couple of the pieces. The patio here is awesome. The misters really keep the temperature down, though I will have to really judge that in July.   They have the BEST soundtrack playing, too. It's a mix of awesome 80s music. Oh, and their wall is covered in cassette tapes. Some of them are mixed tapes. FTW!!! (Bring $5 for the valet. There is street parking, but it's hard to come by.)

It's dangerous that I live so close to this place! I can walk there. Which I should, since it's ice cream and I need to work some of it off. Get the peanut butter with a scoop of chocolate. They have candy, too. I came home with stuff I haven't had since I was a kid. (it's no Smeeks, but they have about a dozen different candies to choose from.) Don't think it's on par with Sweet Republic, but it is good, especially with Mary Coyle's closing. The outside seating is nice and the misters work *really* well.

Went here for dinner with a few friends before Buzzcation a few weeks ago. I love this place! You go upstairs & there is an AMAZING patio! The service was super friendly, too. I had the spaghetti and meatballs and you can bet I ate every last bite of those balls. The dish itself wasn't so huge that I was stuffed and didn't have to have a box of leftovers in my car to stink it up. It was juuuuuuuust right. And talk about a small world! The GM's wife owns The Herb Box, one of my favorites! I don't know much about the drinks there, but I do know the food & staff were stellar. I'll be back. (Don't say it like Arnold because he cheated on his awesome wife with a freaking housekeeper. What a loser!)

As a comedian who's been to dozens of comedy clubs, I was extremely disappointed with the disorganization of StandUp Live. I live in CenPho. CityScape is something I'd been anticipating and happy to have Downtown. It's about time we get a real comedy club here! I'd rather spend my money locally than drive to Tempe. (I WON tickets to see Chris Titus, but they were $25 each which is more than fair to pay for this kind of talent. Review is based on the rest of the experience.) My email notified me to be at the venue for the show, which was supposed to start at 9:45. We got there at 9:30. And stood in line at will-call for 10 minutes. (She asked for our parking stub to validate. Thanks!) There was a big group in front of us, a few behind us and ONE girl working the ticket booth. One. On a Friday night. For Chris Titus. Fail #1. As we walked upstairs, there were people lined up, waiting to get in. They gave out a buzzer to let you know when it was your turn to be seated. What??? Why not seat people as they showed up? Don't you want people to start ordering drinks & food BEFORE a show starts? I've gone to clubs early to have a bite to eat and get settled before the show starts. Besides, like comics like to say "The more you drink, the funnier I am."  Fail #2 So, we wait. We were told to go into the lobby, with our buzzer, to wait to be seated. Servers were lined up to take each party to their tables. That's the only nice touch of the evening, but even they were backed-up. (It was nice, though, to be out of the monsoon heat!) My buzzer started to blink, so I went to the podium to let the girl working there know. I was informed that it also had to vibrate to get seated. WHY DID IT START BLINKING, THEN??? Fail #3 So, we waiting another half hour. By then, it was after 10:30. The show was supposed to start at 9:45. (So I was told) I am ok waiting a little while. It was the second show of the night, tables have to be cleaned, etc. But it was now almost an hour past the time I was told it would  start. Fail #4 Two people in my party went into the bar next door to get drinks, which didn't count towards the 2-drink minimum. Wait, what? Patrons are spending money within the same company, yet those drinks don't count? Fail #5 Finally, we were seated. Our server happened to be a fellow comedian, and he did a great job. He was the only saving grace of the evening (besides the entertainment itself.) Chris Titus wore a wireless mic, which is great for his act, but the volume? Fail #6  I wish I had checked our tab (and other reviews before going) at the end of the night. Based on the other reviews, we may have been charged the gratuity, but we still left a tip. Prices were CRAZY and NOT on the menu. My friend's martini was $11. And it was TINY. She never would have ordered it if she had known how much it was. I got a non-alcoholic pina colada, which was $6. That's a fair price, but still not on the menu. Fail #7 Our server let us know when last call was & we got our bill in a timely manner. We all paid cash (which, based on other reviews, I am thankful for!) and got our change promptly. The show finally ended just before 12:30. Again, Titus was awesome and did a 90-minute set. But for the long wait to get our tickets, get in line, get in another line and get seated made the evening not as enjoyable as I had anticipated. I really hope StandUp Live gets their seating & serving system more organized. Apparently, they were "trying something new" last night. That's something that should be worked out on a slower night, NOT when you've got a few hundred people waiting to see a national headliner who's also had TV shows & is incredibly popular.  Please, please, please find a system that will make patrons happy & comfortable to be there! I would hate to see this club not do well because of some little adjustments that could be made NOW, rather than when it's too late. We NEED to keep a comedy club Downtown. We NEED CityScape to succeed. But multiple bad experiences by a lot of people aren't going to help the cause.

Hooray!!! It seems at though SUL (as it's called in the comedy circle) worked out their kinks, now that it's been open for several months. Seating was quick, service was attentive and everything just ran smoothly. I'm glad, too, because the acts were all hysterical.  You can bet that this will be my #1 comedy club to go to in the Valley. If you check their website, there are a LOT of amazing acts coming up, too! If you get on their mailing list, you get specials texted to you. Sometimes it's for a free show. Score! Tip: Park in the garage UNDER CityScape. They validate. There is also a monthly showcase of local comedians.

I'm kind of worried about this place. First, this is for the new location Downtown. I guess they have another one in Park Central, but I've never seen it. When you call for takeout, they remind you of which location you're calling. I like that because some people are idiots and will probably go to the other one. I loooooooove the curried noodle dish. I've eaten it in the restaurant and ordered it for takeout. The service is super friendly and the place itself is really nice.  Call ahead before going, though. I drove down there one night after checking their hours and they were closed. Who does that????? That's the main reason I'm worried about this place staying open. It gets a good lunch crowd, but they need to work on dinner, too. Prices are reasonable and on par with the 87 other Thai places Downtown.

Malt. Not the liquor, the vinegar. If a place has malt vinegar for their fries, I'm sold. Ok, in places with malt vinegar, they're called "chips," not fries. Anyway... Group of 6 of us showed up to have a lunch meeting. They had no issues with us pulling an extra table in to accommodate us. (By the way, I had no idea there were two Ms in that word!). Service was super-quick. Our server was right on us & took our drink orders.  I had the fish n chips, which is what I always get. I'm a freak for it! The fish had a really crispy batter that wasn't heavy. It was cooked all the way through. It makes me barfy if I get fish with batter that's so thick there's still raw batter. Sick! FRESH fries. I mean chips. They still had the skin on them, which is my very favorite.  She even brought us a bowl of lemon wedges for our fish. We didn't even have to ask for our checks, either. Well, maybe she just wanted to get rid of us, but we were only there for a little over an hour. Or, we were so obnoxious she wanted to get us out of there. I doubt it, as she seemed to be able to tolerate The Rowdies. With a tip, I paid $11 for my lunch. That's a great value and I was stuffed. Not food coma stuffed, but nicely stuffed. Not like Thanksgiving, but like...a business lunch. They even have OTB there. I don't bet on the horsies, though.  P.S. This used to be called Hail Mary's.

ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh the burrito bowl! I, for some reason, don't feel like such a hog when I have the bowl, as opposed to their gigantic burritos! The barbacoa is delish!   I also like that you can choose which beans you want: black or pinto.  Several different salsas to choose from. Staff is always friendly, too.   I usually go to the one near the Biltmore of the one on 92nd St and Shea. Plus, it gives me an opportunity to use my Spanish!

Thanks to Chow Bella, my friend Lori saw that this place was opening Monday and we decided to go that night to check it out. We planned on being there by 6, and I was a bit worried. Old Town. Day off for many. New place by Chef Esparza. Luckily, we got there just in the nick of time, as the place started to get pretty busy. Looking at the menu was a little overwhelming, as there are dozens of different tacos to choose from. Yes, there are other things on the menu, but the tacos are the selling points because of the variety. I brought the menu home with me just to write this review, because we sampled so much ! (It's ok, it's also a take-out place and you can take the menu. I am not a crook. HAHAHA!) We started with the elote, which you can get in a cup. It was delicious! We polished it off and ended up ordering another one later in the meal. The tacos we had? The flank steak with an egg (of course), barrio pollo y chorizo, carnitas, cochinita pibil, camaron, and camaron con coco. We also had the green chile tamale. Everything was tasty and wiped out in seconds! Here's where the final star for the review got taken away: Service. It started out great, but after the first half hour, it seemed as if we were forgotten. It was getting pretty busy, but with a chef who has so much experience, and a grand opening, the staff should have been better prepared. We had also ordered some things to go, and it took 45 minutes to get that. Luckily, the manger was really apologetic (and super cute!) so we didn't feel like total losers. It also would have been nice for Silvana to thank the people who came out. We saw her a few times showing people her other new place next door and even congratulated her, but we basically got a nod and that was it.

I had my second deep tissue massage from Melissa last week. Not many therapists really know how to do deep tissue, and think that rubbing hard is deep tissue. It's not. I hike 20-30 miles every week, and my legs get pretty sore. Melissa got into my sore spots and worked out some really tight places. I'm going back next week!

The eye twitch from Hell got me for about 6 weeks before I finally mentioned it to Rachel at The NMT Studio. She got into some pressure points in my shoulders, neck, and upper back, and it's almost gone now. There is not much that is as annoying as an eye twitch. Seriously.

I grew up back East, in Upstate NY. A lot of our grocery stores had big bulk sections. I moved here 11 years ago and I'm surprised by the lack of bulk sections, except for Sprouts. I love WinCo. Their produce selection is pretty good.  But the bulk section is what keeps me coming back. You can get bulk everything. I get granola, dried blueberries, nuts, even pasta. They have small racks with recipes throughout the section, too.  I also like that they post the prices of their competitors. Coffee is almost 30% cheaper there (I like to buy beans).  The employees are happy. That makes a difference to me. Also, they have an amazing social media presence.

I'm at a loss for the high reviews for this place. Maybe I was there on an off day. I live within walking distance, so I wish I liked it more. I had a caramel-flavored yogurt that tasted just like...sugar. The toppings selection isn't as good as most of the other yogurt shops, either. I'm a mochi fan and there was only one flavor.  Meh.

Yeah, you read that right: 5 stars. Based on last night, it could not possibly have gone any better than it did. A friend of mine, Noelle, had her birthday dinner there last night. There were ten of us in the party. We ordered a few pizzas to share and some of us ordered appetizers as well. I almost gobbled up an entire pizza. I'm not kidding.  Sweet baby jesus. The polenta side was nothing short of amazing. Sticks of polenta, deep-fried and then rolled in freshly grated parmesan. It was served with a side of some sort of crazy good sauce on the side. When the order arrived, everyone around me was eyeing my plate. I shared, of course, but not very willingly. I am drooling as I write this, by the way. One of the pizzas we ordered, the Manifesto, was really good. I had 3 pieces! We also ordered the Margherita, the 4-cheese, and one that was covered in fresh greens. I don't even care about the name of it, that's how good it was. One of the girls brought Noelle a gift basket of wines. During the dinner, the basket tipped and one of the wine bottles fell out and smashed on the floor. Noelle cries over spilled wine. Federal Pizza replaced the bottle! It wasn't even bought there! How cool is that? Service was impeccable. I'm a thirsty person. My drink never emptied enough for me to ask for a refill. We were there for 3 hours and the servers we had never forgot about us. Well, it's not like they could. We're an unforgettable crowd.

Have you ever lain on a bed and never wanted to get up?  We went to Hair Wars this past weekend and stayed at the Hard Rock.  The bed was DIVINE!  I rarely get a good night's sleep at a hotel.   The decor in the room was really contemporary.  Flat-screen TV built into the wall.  Even a little "magic door" that had the internet connection for your laptop.   And then...trumpets and drum roll, please...the bed!  Sunk right in.  Firm but not hard pillows.  The comforter...well, I almost took it home with me! The bathtub was HUGE.  I would have invited a special guest to share the bath experience with me, but I was there with my boss and Jenni from work.   OMG the funniest thing?  Two little cans of AXE on the sink.  What is this, Scottsdale douche?  Ha! Everyone working there was friendly (probably because we were the only non-drunk-obnoxious people in the place.) I would definitely stay here again. Minus one star for the doors being so thin, I could hear every drunk bastard come in at 4am.  Hey, we had just come in ourselves, so it didn't totally ruin anything. Oh, and how can you not enjoy spotting Evil Dick from Big Brother, walking around all day and night, by himself?  I think he was hoping someone would notice him.  Hell, even Jenni from work had to tell me who he was.  I had no clue.  If it's not about me...

I'm not sure a little locally-owned pizza/pasta place could really get any better. In fact, it was higher than my expectations. See, I just took a cross-country trip with my friend Jimmy. We made a road trip movie. Anyway, almost a month on the road means you eat a lot of pizza. Some of it was passable, but most of it wasn't. We are both originally from the East coast, so we know pizza. We are both from different parts of Upstate NY. We *know* pizza. He had been raving about this place for a few weeks, so we decided to have a business meeting there. It's in a non-descript strip mall in North Phoenix, just like everything else up there. But as soon as you walk in, you realize it's not just a strip mall eatery. The decor is crisp, but warm. There's not a lot of clutter anywhere in this place. The tables are nice, as are the chairs. It just feels cleaner than a pizza joint. We started out with the bruschetta. My mouth is watering, because the leftovers are in a box on my cupboard. It is served as a pizza, cut into slices. It's LOADED with olive oil, fresh garlic, and freshly topped tomatoes. The dough is chewy and crisp, just the way I like it. But what really made the whole thing pop? The salt. It had the right amount of salt. I hate when people don't salt stuff. Salt and olive oil, in fact, is one of my very favorite combinations of all time. There was enough olive oil to sop up on the plate with the crust from the bruschetta. Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm I can't wait to eat the pieces sitting there, waiting for me. We ordered a pepperoni pizza, slightly burnt. It. Was. Perfect. When they brought it out, and I saw that little amount of grease on top, I knew it was going to make me cry. It almost did. It was that good. They use fresh ingredients, including the cheese. It was ooey and gooey and perfect. I even had grease dripping down my hand, which is a sure sign of a real pizza pie! They carry Pepsi products, too. I never drink pop that late in the day (I like sleeping), but I couldn't resist. Dessert was tiramisu, of course. It wasn't heavy like some I've had. It was perfectly spongy. There's a TV behind the bar area, too. You have to go check this place out. The owners are super friendly. They are also very clean. As soon as I took the wrapper off my straw, they came and threw it out. A piece of lettuce on the table was gotten rid of immediately, too.  I'm going to go dig into that bruschetta now.

I've been a patron of Brad's and Kat's for about three years, starting with, of course, the food truck. They've always been supportive of me, so naturally I had to have dinner at the brick-and-mortar. I love this place. I love the industrial decor. It's simple. My boyfriend loves the fried pickles. The different pop flavors are also something different, that you wouldn't get at many places. And how can you not love a hot dog place attached to a pie place??? ONLY A CRAZY PERSON wouldn't fall in love with that concept. I'm so glad business has been good for Brad & Kat, because these guys really deserve their success. :)

I've only gotten coffee here, so I don't have a whole lot to say. My boyfriend lives in Gilbert, which, to me, is chain central. I was happy to see the sign for a grand opening, and a name I didn't know.  It's cute inside. The decor is modern. The staff (I think they are the owners) were super friendly. My request for an ice cube in my coffee didn't cause them to bat an eye, like at some places.  I will definitely eat here next time I go in. The menu looked fresh, and i believe everything is vegetarian.

Dexter is 12 pounds, so I go to the small dog side of the park. I'm worried that not enough people know about it yet. I've gone a few times and I've been the only one there for awhile. It's so sad to see Dexter tear off his leash, run like lightning around the park, only to find nobody to play with. They've planted some trees that will provide some more shade in the next few years. For now, there's a big tree and a low stone wall at the eastern end. There is a picnic table and a bench, too.  Dexter thinks the drinking fountain is the coolest thing. There's a spout at the bottom for dogs to drink from. It's way cleaner than when you see dishes out at the dog park, with standing water, dirt, and drool in it.  It's about a 20-minute bike ride for me to get there, so it's also a good workout for me to throw Dexter in the basket and ride down from Camelback Rd.

When my best friend Deb told me we'd be going here for lunch, I got excited, but not THAT excited. I live in a bubble and don't always know what's going on out there. She told me she'd pick me up at 9:45. AM. In the morning. To go to BBQ. Whaaattt???!!!   We got there a little after 10, and there was already a line of about 50 people. Our wait was about 90 minutes. The banter at the counter made it all worth it. The guys are so great! When I can interact with the people who make the magic, like my trip to Welcome Diner when Payton Curry was there, it makes the experience so much more fun for me.   The menu is simple. Love it. I got "2 Meats," which is a choice of 2 meats (GET IT???) and 2 sides. I chose the beans and jalapeno cheddar grits. During our banter, I mentioned it was my birthday weekend. Seriously, I have told everyone I have seen this weekend that it's my birthday weekend. IDGAF. One of the guys gave me a little pecan pie for my birthday. How sweet is that?   When I sat down to eat, I took my douchebag food pic and dug in. And my eyes welled up with tears. My meal was gorgeous. Not just to look at, but to taste and feel. Simply. Gorgeous.   My mom wants to go, but I'm not letting her bring my stepdad. He is very impatient and I don't want him ruining my experience.   I can't wait to eat the leftover sausage this morning with my eggs. I. Can't. Wait.
