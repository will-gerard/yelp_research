Used to be great place. Food is horrible now. Doesn't feel fresh and soup had a smell. Chicken and beef cold inside and all saggy.

Wasn't clean and flies all over the place. Placed an order for wife but I don't think their customer service is that great. Lady wasn't that friendly.

This company is a bully. Abusing their power and policy. You guys need to do some changes. We had issue with our account and couldn't pay it get the phone. Customer service rep was horrible. Didn't help. I have money on the account and can't Ben pay online,debit card, or credit card. Must be cash. Fine. We went to kiosk same thing aps placed account into collections. I have money sitting in my account and can't even pay and rep tell me I need to pay at kiosk but can't. Told to wait until Monday morning but the Shut Off is possible and scheduled. A.G. Needs to look this company up and APS be shamed of yourselves. You need to change your board and senior management. This is abuse and inconvenient.

Really bad service. Ordered water waited total of 7 min. Than after I requested regular soda drink Same thing and never got refill ha to ask for refill.  Also after we finished appetizer a waitress didn't even bother picking up the plates. So we had to battle with the table space. Sushi wasn't even properly wrapped.  A salmon that we ordered was still cold inside and DRY. I told waitress and her response was OK. I give this place two stars. I give an extra star just for the set up. Besides that food is bad. And service horrible. Owner should focus on who they hire.  Just advice. It's a great location. But just an advice

I will give two stars because server was cool.  Food, not great.  Sliders I had were so hard that I couldnt even chew on them.  Meat inside was dry, and texture was bad.  Also the wings were not even close to be what they should be.  Few of them were cold and mushy.  Not impressed at all.

Always great customer service, staff are always friendly and professional, they always answer your questions and they know what they are doing. Customer Service manager is always friendly and nice and her tellers are trained well and always there to help us. The atmosphere is always great and they always acknowledge you when you come in even if you have to wait.

Customer service is a big issue here. Once you walk in you wait for a long time. One customer was getting irritated with them because he kept waiting and not getting his to go order. Some of the customers were just ignored and walked out because they couldn't wait anymore. Quality of their food is decent but the customer service needs to be fixed. When you see multiple people leaving their tables it will hurt your business. I think the biggest problem at this place is leadership and lack of leadership skills. Also waitress should never tell other customers "oh that guy is mad at me", because he waited long time for his order. I just don't think it's professional.

Best haircut I ever got.  Great service, and from now on I'll be their customer. Danny did great job, really impressed. Place is nice and clean, enjoyable, and I recommended this place to anyone.  They know their stuff.

Great place! Staff are great, very friendly and helpful. They know you by your name and they want to make sure you're happy. Even if they are busy they acknowledge that they'll be right with you. Dr. Smith is great,  he helps me and my wife. He was able to help my wife with her migraine and headache. We've going to Dr Smith for almost a year. I definitely recommend this location and especially Dr Smith.

I came to this place for my very first time. I didn't know place was clapping at 20:00 so we got there around 19:50. I asked the guy about their closing time but he told me not to worry about it and to feel welcome. We ordered our food and both me and wife really enjoyed our food. Server (Olga) was really nice and professional. Food was fresh and my burger I had was juicy and same with my wife's fish. I'm definitely coming back here.

Horrible service, never friendly and this office also lost my original passport years ago. Every time lines are long, and they never smile. Just rude and horrible service. Also hen you call them their line most of the time is set on busy so you can't even get ahold of them. That's why FedEx and UPS will get my business. Not this place.

I'm really glad I found a great dentist. Dr Loud is super nice very professional.  She takes her time with her patients and the staff are super friendly,  they go over everything, over your plan coverage what's expected very professional and I don't feel rushed. Highly recommended.
