We had a reservation for 6 and were promptly seated upon arrival. Our server was fantastic! I had the blue cheese filet (wrapped in bacon) and it was absolutely delicious. Had a bite of the key lime pie and it was wonderful! I had two Black Diamond Martinis and probably should have only had one - super sweet!   We are looking forward to going back!

I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this neighborhood bar.  It is perfect for hanging out with friends over drinks... The food and drinks are reasonably priced (cheaper than most places), the staff remembers your name and you can play the jukebox from a smartphone app (no more standing in line with dollars).  In addition, they highlight some great bands and have poker games, everyday. BONUS: pool table and darts.  I've been a patron for over 13 years and drive in from Anthem just for their warm service.

The food is always great and the atmosphere ranges from chillax to party depending on the live entertainment! Solo artists, bands, and karaoke fill up the weekends and during football season, you don't want to be anywhere else...well, I know I don't. So easy to lose track of time!

Brought my husband here for Father's Day brunch and quickly discovered they only prepare and serve steak at dinner. They did verbally offer one cut for lunch, after I inquired, and while it was okay, we were stunned that the venue refers to itself as a steakhouse yet, only serves it for dinner.

Love the ribbies! The meat falls off the bone! Also, the grown-up grilled cheese is spectacular!

My first time at this bistro and will definitely be back! It's perfect for to-go orders and the food is terrific! Serving soup, salads, sides, and sandwiches, I went for the Tasty Turkey Sammich- provolone, turkey, crispy bacon, spinach, and onion..and I asked mine to be wrapped in lettuce (I'm watching carbs). The ingredients were fresh and flavorful and the tomato and cucumber salad I ordered was equally as tasty. BONUS: The value is solid! Next time, which will be within the week, I'm getting the Spicy Italian Sammich-pepperoni, soppresata, salami, and provolone...and yep, in lieu of the garlic hogi, I'll be asking for a lettuce wrap!

Hands down, the very best protein shake.....EVER! I've tried Shakeology, Herbalife, and a couple others and by far, this product beats all of them.  I like the time-release protein, the flavors are all great, and vanilla and chocolate are my two favorite. Erik often suggests new recipes and I've never tried a bad one. When I want to drop a few pounds, I begin replacing 2 meals a day with the meal replacement shake (still eating protein snacks and a sensible dinner) and in about 2 weeks, I lose 5-6 pounds. In addition, Erik is professional, efficient, and always quick to respond. I recommend this product to everyone I meet!

Last night I had the charcuterie board and it was fantastic! Tonight, I had grilled watermelon wrapped in prosciutto, a Caesar Salad with chicken and I wrote home about it! Literally!! I live 45 minutes away and my husband and I are already planning to visit in the next week! It's new and it is a MUST!
