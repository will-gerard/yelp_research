Quality NY slice of pie. Had the pepperoni and it did not disappoint at all. This is a mom and pop, family place and it exceeded my expectations.  Could it benefit from an updated look? Sure, but I'm more into good food than good aesthetics. It's got a bit of a NYer attitude, if you can't handle that, don't come - your loss.

Yeah, this is a damn good sandwich.  Its not your typical super gooey cheese steak, its got a far more authentic feel than that. I believe each is good in their own right, but Philly's Famous is a notch above. I was skeptical when they first asked if I wanted red sauce on my Philly, but it was recommended. Being one that prefers to experience food the way it was intended, I added the red sauce. Red sauce is now a must for every Philly's Famous experience. I get the Pepper Jack Philly with grilled onions.  I do love a green pepper in the mix, but I do not like the sweet pickled green peppers they (and pretty much all other philly places) offer.  That is purely my taste preference, not a fault of theirs.   Its family owned and operated.  What a great family too, my goodness, they are the nicest people. After only a couple times there they began to recognize me, which added a nice personal touch, and they still remember me if I haven't been there in a while.   You will not be disappointed.

Napkins required! I dare you to eat a wonderfully gooey cheesesteak here without making a mess.   They do a great job on their food. The roll is springy and fresh. The steak has great flavor, texture, and a thickness. You have a lot of cheese options, but they have the classic cheese wiz. We're talking old school style cheese wiz. A real treat, but if you're a bit faint of heart on cheese wiz, their other options won't disappoint. Grilled onions are good and retain a nice texture. A HUGE plus in my book is being able to add regular ol' sautéed bell peppers, instead of the sweet pickeled ones (they have those too, I just can't get past the taste of them no matter where I am). For a little heat, you can add cherry peppers or jalapeños. I went for cherry peppers and it was awesome. The even better part that has to be mentioned is this is a cheesy cheesesteak. I like mine cheesy and without fail I have to order extra cheese, well until I came here. Their regular sandwhich, without extras, satisfies my cheesy needs and then some. Of course, should I ever want to experience cheese nirvana, they offer an option for extra cheese. One of these days, I'll order extra cheese, simply because I can, but right now the idea of extra cheese here is slightly intimidating in the best possible way.   Fries are fries, but their's are good. What makes them special is the dipping sauce they have. Reminds me of what mom called "russian dressing" and put on hamburgers when I was a kid. I still make it to this day.  I'm not going to ruin the recipe for them, but it's a mayo and tomato based sauce that you mustn't pass up. It's almost a mexi-ranch without the ranch flavor.   Staff is very friendly and knowledgeable enough to make solid recommendations, if you want to have a sandwhich that is far better than an average cheesesteak. Service is quick, but there was nobody ahead of me when I went. Prior trips have felt similarly fast though with consistently good quality service.   In a valley of mediocre cheesesteak shops, Forefathers is a cut above the rest.

Went looking for a Philly cheese-steak. Walked away with so much more! The philly was truly delicious.  They hyped up the bread a lot and it lived up to it.  The philly had a great balance of cheese/meat/veggie goodness. I like cheesy steaks and usually find myself needing to get extra cheese, but not here. Though I might away, just for giggles.   Since the order was to go, they recommended the green chili mac and cheese because "it travels better." First off, kudos to them for being THAT attentive. Secondly, I'd recommend the mac and cheese no matter where you eat it.     I also had the wings (just had to). I went for a medium buffalo and took the suggestion of adding the prickly pear sauce to them - DO THIS! The flavors mixed incredibly well, and the heat was just right.   This is a place to return to again, and again.

Went with the 3 meat plate: brisket,  pulled pork, and ribs. Brisket was fork tender, pulled pork was moist and delicious, and the ribs had an incedible smokey flavor. They even off burnt ends (ordering next time, a real treat for a bbq lover). Some of the best bbq in AZ!

This location is the best America's Taco Shop of all the ones I've been to. The quality of the food is a notch above the rest. Even if you haven't liked ATS in the past, I'd suggest giving this one a try before writing it off. The staff are exceptional and the owner of this location is the real deal business owner. When he's not checking in with his customers and managing things he's rubbing elbows with his employees. I've had the pleasure of talking with him more than once and I can assure you he's passionate about his work and it shows in employee demeanor and high quality food.   I'm a sucker for their Al Pastor and Bean/Cheese Burrito. When you get Pastor at other places, it's usually kind of greasy and gritty due to the cut of pork, but not here. I don't know if they use a different cut or really trim the meat before cooking, but whatever they do pays off BIG TIME!   I don't always get it, but the Horchata is wonderful. One time when I was talking with the owner, he brought me a Horchata coffee drink - I have no idea what it's called (Horchatalatte? I'm sure if you ask him he'll know), but it was damn near a religious experience it was so good.

0 starts if possible. Terrible customer service. I spent $400 on two pieces only to have some hardware missing. Went back to have the provide the hardware and they put me on the phone (on hold fornmore than 15min) with "customer service" with some lame promise to overnight the missing hardware. Very lousy experience. Only after some exasperating conversations, they magically had it available in their pickup dock. When I get there, they don't know what hardware I'm missing, even after explicitly telling the customers service phone rep - because she apparently exchanged the other item I purchased the same day, you know, the one I didn't mention to her. Just poor business practices all around. This should have been handled quickly and in person.

The staff is always super courteous. The place itself is clean and inviting. They offer a variety of juices, smoothies, and acai bowls. I'm only had the juice, but each one has been wonderful. This is a regular place for me when I'm doing a juice fast.   Because they are busy, they can get backed up. Often I'm told it will be 10-15min when they are busy. Personally, I have no issue with this, but some might. Could they benefit from another juicer and more staff? Maybe, but I don't know where you would put it, its a rather small store, but I feel it adds to the charm.   My only complaint is they don't have pineapple for juicing. Maybe its just me, but I kinda think its a swing and a miss.   Plus at 8.50 for a 32oz juice, you can't go wrong. Sure, I can juice at home for way less (and I do), but lets face it, I'm not coming here when I can/feel like juicing at home.

Crop to cup. Percolate on that for a moment, realizing this is the only time "percolate" and "Peixoto" should be joined together, ever. Using a percolator on this coffee is akin to murder and while we're at it, let's add drip coffee makers to the list of taboos too.   For those not on the "coffee aficionado" bandwagon (there's still room, hop on!), crop to cup means that the family owns, grows, and harvests the coffee on their land in Brazil, ships it up to their shop in downtown Chandler, where they roast it, brew it, and sell it.  Translation: this is special.   I'm excruciatingly picky about my coffee, even more so about my favorite shops, so I've held off reviewing Peixoto until I had a chance to run them through the gamut of things I order at a coffee shop. This has equated to roughly half a dozen visits. As with most places I go to for the first time, I had the barista recommend something from their coffee menu to impress me with. She recommended a cortado, which A) I've never had before, B) never heard of, C) she explained was the best way to truly get a taste for their espresso. Its like a latte, but more of a 1:1 espresso to milk ratio and it performed exactly has she said it would. The chocolate and bright notes were present, yet perfectly tempered by the milk.  Then I moved on to the toddy (cold brewed iced coffee), which is unique from other places. Hands down I would say their toddy is bolder and/or stronger than most places that bother to make toddy. In doing so, I think some of the nuance of their very flavorful Brazilian roast is lost and/or overshadowed by the strength, but you still end up with a quality toddy. This isn't a criticism, its just different. Their Ethiopian roast brewed in a Chemex pour-over sends you on a delightful trip of berry and brightness that is just otherworldly and my favorite thing to order.  Their espresso alone is rather unique too, with deep chocolate richness with bright notes that dance around your mouth with each sip. Lastly, I purchased a pound of whole bean Brazilian single origin and brought it home. I grind it as needed with my bur grinder and have used in in my french press and Aeropress.  It was roasted on 2/10 and I was incredibly impressed when I made a french press yesterday (3/2, 20 days after roasting) that there was still a respectable crema present - and I accidentally left it in their bag, not the airtight canister I usually keep my coffee in.  The place is decorated tastefully and has a nice ambiance. I haven't actually sat there for long, though I intend to, but they offer comfortable couches, generous tables, stools at the coffee bar, and nice outdoor seating. I imagine it would be easy to spend hours there comfortably, and I intend to test this theory soon.   Everyone that works there has been top notch. They are all well versed on their product and confident in their recommendations. Some of the staff are so knowledgeable, that I almost feel like a coffee novice discovering a drip coffee maker for the first time when I talk to them - and I've experimented with roasting my own beans! I encourage you to get to know the staff, they really add to overall experience.   In summary, this place is top notch and primed for a Best of the Valley award. The SE Valley was in desperate need of a quality shop and Peixoto fills this gap beautifully. I'm incredibly excited to have this family owned shop in my "backyard" and I'm looking forward to brewing a coffee lover's dream with them.  I've read some of the less glorifying reviews and to be honest, I don't quite follow the issues. For instance, $4.50 for a Chemex  with your choice of bean is a bargain compared to the small handful of places in the Valley that even offer Chemex service, let alone know what it is. Sure, 4.50 is expensive for "a cup of coffee" but Chemex with locally roasted single origin beans is far beyond "a cup of coffee" and to understand what I mean by that, I strongly encourage you to: 1.) go to Peixoto, 2.) sit at the bar, 3.) ask them about the Chemex and why its different, 4.) roll the dice and order an Ethiopian Chemex and see if they can give you a sample of their drip for a side-by-side comparison. If the difference isn't immediately apparent to you and worth an extra couple bucks, stick with the drip. You're looking at $3 for drip coffee that is superior in limitless ways to anything the "burn everything" Seattle company or gas station sludge can offer you. If that's not enough to sell you on it, you're supporting an AZ locally owned family business, that has opted to cut out the middle man to help support their local farmers. Lastly, to the macchiato review, I'm just venturing a guess that numerous times, people have come in, ordered a "macchiato," expecting the extraordinarily sweetened caramel drink, popularized by the "burn everything" Seattle company and been quite shocked to get an espresso with a dollop of creme froth on top. So yeah, I would double check too.
