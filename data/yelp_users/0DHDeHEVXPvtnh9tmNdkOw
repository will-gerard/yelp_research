What the hell did I just eat. Sure wasn't papa johns... This was so grossness ! There was no garlic sauce first of all, second of all this was a thin flaky crust which it never said it would be. I ordered papa johns for the pizza I was used to and this was nasty. Advertise and deliver correctly . Wtf

This location looks very nice, it has a perfect location. But the service is absolutely ridiculously horrendous. We tried ordering 5 times and the lady at the drive through kept repeating the wrong thing. We offered to drive up to the window and she yelled at us. To top it all off the entire order was wrong. Wow.....

This review is long overdue. I'll keep it short and simple, If you're a guy that cares about his hair then come here. They only have the best of the best cutting your hair and Borris will make sure you're leaving happy. It has a laid back vibe that you can come and hangout in the rare occasion that you have to wait. No matter who cuts me up, I'm always leaving happy

Sickest new place in old town scottsdale. Another addition to that block to make it the only place youll need to go to party.   The food is super good surprisingly, i got the bbq chicken and potato salad. BOMB.   If you get bottle service they have beer taps on the tables, and better yet they have hard alch on tap too. Once table has goose...on tap.... sickest thing ever.   The lines are insanely long, but that should shorten as time goes by so definitely check this place out.

Finally a Cornish pasty co. That can actually fit people! This new spot is awesome, it has a really nice outside deck area and a huge bar you can sit at.  For all you newcomers, the good seems simple but it's amazingggg and the drinks are good and cheap.    Three tips:   -Irish car bombs (better than usual) -mushroom walnut soup (literally the best soup in the world, even though we are in Arizona) -pepper steak pasty is really good

It's kinda hard to differentiate a movie theater..... But this one is amazing! I don't know if it's AMC revamping their brand or if it's this one specifically, but the last 5 movies I've seen I've driven 20 minutes from my house just to come here... Even when there's one across the street.  Here's why:  * my ticket was $ 7.50 on a Saturday night * the staff is super friendly and helpful, unlike most which you feel like you're bothering them. * THE SEATS ARE AMAZING. They are so comfy it almost kinda sucks Cus I've fallen asleep... But they are like lazy boys and fully recline & you can reserve them.  Come here for your next movie, you'll be hooked!

Wasted grain is an awesome new spot in old town, prime location! They have good food, drink specials and a spacious layout. One of the best things about it is that it's almost like 3 bars in one: there's an inside with tables and a stage for bands, happy hour vibe. An outside with games and hightops which is needed in Arizona, and then the upstairs is a club like feel. It keeps it original and def doesn't get old.  The reason this review is getting 3 stars is the horrrrrrible cover band they have on Saturday nights. It's the busiest night In old town and they should have prime entertainment to bring in more people. Instead this annoying sounding band plays the worst one hit wonders that are old and outdated. I literally left last night because the music was hurting my ears.  If this place wants to stay in the highly competitive nightlife of old town scottsdale they really need to rethink their Saturday night Agenda.  The music makes My ears literally hurt
