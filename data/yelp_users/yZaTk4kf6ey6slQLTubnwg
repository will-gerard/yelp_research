BF and i come here once awhile and always order chicken thai basil and it was always good  Today I want to adventure and try something new and ordered the nice noodles soup. I just wow wow... I think they put the whole bag of msg and salt in there, I mean i have never experienced like that at any restaurants that I been. I pour all the water from glass into the soup to rinse it up so that I can at least eat the noodles. Don't get me wrong I love salty food but this is out of this world. I think if you have high blood pressure, you will end up in emergency room after eating this dish. I felt dizzy, and mouth is all nurm and my heart beating so much,  the rice noodles soup that can kill you, be ware

BF and I come here at least once aweek and today is kind of disappointed.  Noodles is under cook, meat is over cook and the broth doesn't have any flover.

BF and I  were craving for pho for cold and rainy day for that sunday. Originally we was going to go to pho 66 by Lee Lee market.but I can't find on Yelp so I thought the business is closed down. But after we find out they change their name.  So we decided to try this place out since we already been there in the past. But I think they change the new owner. It was Sunday afternoon and lee lee market plaza parking is pack. But that place is empty with only 2 tables. The service was horrible. Super slow and so hard to get the waitresses attention. The pho broth was so blend and you don't smell any spice and the meat was so much fat in it and I can't swallow.the fat was very stink too. My BF got bad diahearra and they put so much msg in broth that we both feeling sick after eating that for all day.never go back again. Especially they are so many good pho places around east valley. Next time we are trying pho place next to lee lee market. That place was pack on that day after we have bad experience with this place and we walk to lee lee and find out but it's too late.

We love this place. The decorations and open kitchen is my favorite.  This is the most authentic szechwan restaurant in AZ. business is always pack too. Spicy water boil fish, cumin lamb, spicy eggplant, chicken skewer, sizzling rice seafood soup, name a few, so so many dish that we want to try, we will definitely going back.

Glad we stop at this pho place while we are in this part of town. I don't think I can have any other spring Roll than this place. It was the best chicken spring Roll I have in my life. :-)
