Best Lo Mein anywhere in this town! Their dishes always taste fresh and are superbly balanced. We paid them many visits and were never disappointed. They deliver as well.

Bad day? I don't know. I've had better meals at other Red Lobster restaurants. The only good thing about tonight's experience was the waiter, Bryan. Fast, efficient, polite and funny, just how I like it. We had a Lobsterita (huge margarita) and shared it. Regretted it too, since it was way too sour and had a chemical taste to it. I couldn't take but two sips and then I switched to something else that I knew it'll taste much better, water. The salads were made with wilted lettuce and sore looking tomatoes. Croutons were ok. The all too familiar hot bread was good, as it is always. The main dish, a medium cooked steak and grilled shrimp was delivered on time. Steak was chewy at best, although the marinade's taste was ok. Shrimp were grilled well, not too much or too little. My wife's shrimp scampi was absolutely tasteless, overcooked shrimp in some sort of shrimp juice, with very little butter and no garlic. Pretty horrifying if you ask me.  I think this is the last visit we're going to pay to this location. As I said before, I've had much better meals there and I cannot justify the bill when we are not satisfied with the quality of food. Too bad...

It was my Birthday and my wife, her mom, a dear friend and I headed to Fleming's Steakhouse in Chandler, AZ. We heard only great things about this place and wanted to experience their 'unforgettable' steak dishes. That, we did, unfortunately.   The restaurant was lovely dim-lit, adequate atmosphere for an expensive steak place. We were seated immediately and tended to by the waiting staff. The small roll of bread and two kinds of butter were good but insufficient for four hungry souls and we polished it up right away. No one offered to bring more. Our waiter told us about the daily specials, after which we ordered food and wine. After a short wait, four large dinner plates arrived. I was the lucky one, my steak (a large  rib eye steak, ordered medium-rare which tasted very good despite two large blobs of fat) was sitting pretty in the middle of the large dinner plate. Nothing else on my plate, just the steak. I looked around at my wife's plate and couldn't believe, her fillet mignon was laying there, in the middle of the large dinner plate without anything garnishing it, be that a glaze, a leaf, a slice of whatever! At the prices asked by this restaurant, it felt like an insult to each of us to have such a poor presentation of a steak!! We asked our waiter for a side dish, mashed potatoes with Parmesan, and when they arrived, we couldn't believe it! There were no more than two scraggly potatoes turned into mashed potatoes, or about a tablespoon of mashed potatoes per person. Mind you, they tasted good, but at over $9.00 per side dish? In short, we left hungry and wondering why we spent over $200 for the entire meal.  Next time, we'll go to a well tried place for steaks and more. Durant's, downtown Phoenix and worth the drive.

I come here after work for a beer and some fries at least once a week and to relax while chatting with friends from work. I like this place, for it offers some good beers (I like Stella on tap) and good sweet potatoes fries. Unfortunately,  the service leaves to be desired,  I wait for my order to be taken for more than 30 minutes and then another 30 to be delivered. Our server didn't seem to care about whether we need something or not, sometimes I had to flag another server to either take or fulfill our order. And then, at the end, we need to wait for the bill for yet another 30 minutes. While they're still going to get my business, I wish they better their service. Gave only 2 stars this time.

A true Nirvana for classic steaks and more, Durant's delivers yet again a perfect evening. I took my beautiful wife for a dinner and we were promptly seated. The waiter (Marcello) was on top of everything, making sure we had what we wanted, from the extra cold fresh veggies and garlic butter bread to drinks. We both opted for the same dish, grilled scallops with cream sauce and garlic mashed potatoes. Friends, it can't get any better, scallops were grilled to perfection, mashed potatoes were dream-good.   For desert we had a key lime pie which must have been made in heaven. A two plus hour long meal that left us perfectly happy, satisfied and willing to go back for some more. It might be expensive but it's worth every penny. Thank you, Durant's!

All roads lead to Durant's!  Another visit to this superb restaurant, another evening of bliss. We (my wife and I) took my wife's mother out to Durant's for a belated Mother's Day and ordered again the grilled scallops with garlic mashed potatoes. The complimentary soup of the day was navy bean soup, surely the best I've ever had. The garlic/leek buttered bread was a little bit soggy but tasty nevertheless. The main dish was even better than we had before and we ended with a slice of the best key lime pie we ever tasted. There are a lot of fancy restaurants in Phoenix but Durant's is by far the best and the classiest. Can't wait to go back to Durant's in the very near future.

We've been frequenting Romeo's Euro Cafe for some time now and tonight we celebrated Valentine's Day with a feast fit for kings and queens. The ambiance is lovely, with a definitely European feel to it, lighting is subtle and romantic and the menu is chock full of wonderful creations inspired by various European countries. From Paella to Transylvanian style chicken and especially the Marco Polo ravioli, every item is meant to please your palate. Portions are just perfectly sized and the wine selection is well above average. Service was pleasant and courteous and if you're lucky you might even run into Romeo, the owner and master chef extraordinaire. Oh, so I don't forget, the dessert assortment is out of this world. Great job, Romeo!

So they carry a whole variety of meats and cheeses, sausages and pet food, even liquors like beer. Prices are high, normal thing for a Midwestern style butcher shop found in the middle of the Southwest, I can live with that. What I don't understand is the unprofessional attitude of the staff. I asked for a small bag of ice so I can protect the expensive meat I purchased there (temperature outdoors was 109 degrees) and I was looked at like I just descended from Mars. I mean if customers take the time to drive to this shop during the summers in AZ, at least th hey could do is to offer a little complimentary bag of ice, pretty much like other stores do. I had to stop at Lee Lee's and get one of their complimentary bags of ice. I'm done with this shop.

Best Vietnamese fresh rolls anywhere in Arizona! We always have the barbecued pork fresh rolls and they are very tasty and good. Their Pho is good too. The only thing that bothered us was the fishy smell creeping in from the adjacent asian grocery store called Lee-Lee's. But worth the trip...  By the way, we love just about every dish they make, especially #47, beef with vegetables and pan fried wide noodles.

Can you spell f-a-n-t-a-s-t-i-c? As the previous reviewer stated, a very pleasant surprise awaits one when visiting the Tiburon Restaurant at the Wildlife Zoo and Aquarium in Litchfield. I live in Ahwatukee, the other end of the town, and decided to visit the newly opened Aquarium. It's a fine place to visit and see various water creatures, each one more fascinating than the previous one.  Now onto the food...  If you fancy a splendid atmosphere, a delight for your palate, something out of the ordinary yet of fantastic taste, Tiburon it is. My favorite? An appetizer, which followed the cup of lobster bisque (served with a small bottle of Champagne, prefect marriage!). I had the roast duck tacos. The tacos were actually made of lightly fried (and shaped) slices of eggplant, served on a bed of guacamole, elegantly decorated with strips of vegetables. A perfect balance between the gamy tasting duck and veggies accompanied by guacamole. Ended with a chocolate cake of a richness I haven't tasted before. Not too sweet, just right! The owner, Alex, is very warm and chats with you about his dishes and more. The entire atmosphere is really enjoyable, eating next to a huge tank where fish and sharks swim around and around.  I will definitely be back!

Excellent company! I had a sprinkler system failure and one of their techs came and worked it out despite the fact that he didn't feel good. He stayed and corrected the problem instead of postponing this job. This is why I like to work with local mom-and-pop companies, they are professional and courteous to the core. They will have my business from now on.

Went to Anacapa for the second time, the first time Anacapa hosted our wedding reception and the second time we celebrated our 2nd anniversary. We have eaten at many Phoenix restaurants and I can certainly say that Anacapa is one of the top five restaurants in the Valley. Our ribeye steaks were cooked to perfection and tasted ever so much better than the steaks served at Fl____ings, which is a steak specific restaurant. Prices? Half of what one would pay at Fl____ings and you get side dishes too included in that price. Take that, Fl____ings!  Staff is very attentive and prompt, courteous and made us feel very special. We drove about an hour each way to come eat here,  worth every second. We will definitely be back!

Let me just start with admitting that I was born, raised and educated in Romania, hence some might think that I am biased in my opinion about this place. Far from the truth...  Visited today with my wife (Minnesota girl) and we were met with a warm greeting by the owner, Ana. Upon my first impression, I didn't think we're going to find what we were looking for, some fresh Farmers Cheese, a.k.a. "Branza de vaci". Lo' and behold, Ana directed us to her refrigerator where she had 3-4 varieties of it. Ended up buying some mici or mititei  (skinless sausages), Romanian beer and spices. Ana has quite a variety of Eastern European sausages and salami, also cheeses, Tarama (fish roe or caviar), Romanian wines, pickled vegetables, Sauerkraut and a lot more. Too bad there is no authentic Romanian restaurant in the Valley but at least one can find some authentic Eastern European and Romanian products here in hot AZ.  Bravo Ana for being enterprising and taking a chance with your Delicatessen store. We'll definitely visit you often.

A little gem in Chandler, AZ! One great mom and pop Vietnamese restaurant,  ready to delight you with their Pho, fresh rolls, sandwiches,  iced coffee (mmm... the best, eat your heart out, St____cks) and much more. I had Pho, which was very good,  another day I had a pork sandwich and their chicken (marinated in lemon grass) is to die for. The atmosphere is also delightful, both owners are in the premises, cooking and being very friendly with the customers. I love supporting mom and pop restaurants and this little gem needs support.

Fantastic find! We used to come to Pho 68, which, obviously is not here anymore. This new restaurant exceeded our expectations, in both quality and value of foods. We tried their fresh rolls, they're big and tasty. The C'om and the Bun dishes are generous and, although we haven't yet tried their version of Pho, their Beef Stew with Bread, a traditional Vietnamese dish, was outstanding.
