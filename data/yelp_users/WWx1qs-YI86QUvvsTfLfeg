this place is horrible.food is terrible. the frozen appetizers comes out still cold and half thawed. way overpriced. lousy pours on alcohol. i would never go near this place on the weekends and have to deal with all the douchebaggery. if you make it on a weekday for reverse happy hour you can score a 90 schilling or a decent IPA for $3, honestly no sense in going here even if all your buddies are super horny, might as well just skip the overpriced bs and just buy them a lap dance at the strip club. i guarentee you they will enjoy it more than going to a horrible creation of an "irish" hooters.....

wandered in after first friday, sat right down no wait and it was soooooo good!  tiny little place, the kitchen smells amazing. very affordable given the quality and portions of the food. jerk chicken was pretty spicy, just how i like it.  my buddy ordered the scallops and said they were pretty much the best.  excellent drinks (order the coconut water and it is srved in a real coconut that you can scope the "meat" out of) and the two piece musical outfit added great music to chill but definetly not overwhelm. cant wait to go back.

arrowhead grill is the only non-chain steakhouse in the west valley. it is a perfect spot for a real martini and a great delmonico steak. they have awesome specials almost everyday so call to ask or join the email list. recently they have had buy one get one free burgers, filets, delmonicos, prime rib, king crab legs.....definetly worth siging up for. they do bar specials during most sports games (suns, cardinals, coyotes) great alternative to boring bar food.

dont be scared by the location, its not ghetto!  this little plaza almost makes you want to move down the road, almost.... very good breakfast food that is available past the typical 10am cut off. the breakfast pizzas are definetly unique and worth a try.

Very overpriced, beef is too well done, and you have to pay extra for any toppings you want. They are trying with the liquid cheese and the dipped sandwiches but they just fall way short, waaaaay short.

Go for brunch and sit outside, just not when it's 112 degrees. Large portions and very tasty. They won't seat you unless everyone is there so make sure you don't have a super late person or you will just be standing at the front being very hungry.

Very helpful, professional, and super friendly. Best price in town for an insurance appraisal. I would most certainly recommend them. Thank you!

We made a reservation for a birthday on 7/11/11 about a week prior to visiting compound grill, I was very excited to finally eat here, only problem, THEY WERE CLOSED when we showed up. You would think that they would have mentioned to us that they were closed on mondays when we made the reservation for monday or even if they forgot at the time of the reservation, maybe once the date approached they would see in their books that there was a reservation made for a day that they were not even open and call and let us know. nope none of that. So unfortunately I can not rate the food but something tells me things are a little screwed up if you schedule a customer for a reservation on a day you are closed. Get things right and do it quick because I have had the ceviche at culinary festival and it was great.....

mellow mushroom is hands down the best place for beer in the north(westish) valley. great craft beer selection (a ton of rogue varieties) on draft and even more in thebottle and can. happy hour or reverse happy hour  is the time to go, all alcohol is half off and all the appetizers are half off. grilled jerk wings, a capri salad paired with a tasty brew, you cant go wrong. oh ya the pizza combinations are awesome too.

Excellent spot for lunch if you work in the area. This is a great alternative to The same old chain restaurants, crazy packed and overpriced Norterra spots. They always have lunch specials and you get a lot of food for a very reasonable price. It is a grocery store/cafe and the owners are very nice. Has all the normal mediterranean/middle eastern items that one would except along with some other basic grocery items. They open early so I can grab some fruit in the morning and they stay late till 7 or 8pm so i can get some shisha or hookah coals on my way home. Chicken schwarma plate and gyro plate are my favorite so far. Plus get the spicy sauce, it's awesome!

I can no longer hold myself back from speaking out against this unscrupulous tire dealer. Yes, J J is a true professional but his boss, Ralph, the owner, leaves a lot to be desired.  I started doing business with C & R Tire back in July 21, 2009. I bought a set of 4 tires for my pick up. I continued to buy several sets of tires from C & R up to July 2010 for my trucks. We then started having tire failure problems and this is when the owner got involved and destroyed any hope of any future business from me. The tires started to form bubbles on the side wall or the thread itself. This is not just one tire but every single one we bought. The last set failed this week. So far I have replaced 10 tires that I bought from C & R over the time period all with the same defective problem, bubbles on the side wall or thread. Upon the first 2 occurrences, I called C & R. JJ put me on to Ralph, the owner. The answer from Ralph was it was not their problem. It was a road hazard and we were not covered. In his own words, I will never forget this because I wrote it down "You buy the lowest quality tire we have and you don't buy the road hazard protection, what do you expect". Basically, he was telling me that his lower priced tires do not meet the standards of the road without the extra warranty. Road hazards happened to all the tires I bought from C & R .  I now buy my tires from another reputable and well know dealer in town and I can tell you that I do not have to worry about the tires, they stand behind their products. I have not had one tire failure from this other dealer. All tires from C & R failed. Can that be just a coincidence. I don't think so.
