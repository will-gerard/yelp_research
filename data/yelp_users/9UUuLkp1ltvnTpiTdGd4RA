Perfect late night spot. Reminds me of grabbing dinner at a roadside stand in a small town.   Portions are big, food is greasy but fresh, and prices aren't that bad.   I love old valentine diners, and this is a great example. A real gem in Phoenix.

Within walking distance of my office. 'Nuff said.   Okay well there is more. I've gotten accustomed to the whole "stay in the care in the drive thru" at places like starbucks, but got tired of doing the same old. Decided to check out Urban Beans...well a meeting brought me here...and was really happy with the experiences. The art is good, the place is a good size and not too overwhelming in sound or furniture, and the folks are nice. Even a nice outside porch for sitting, but that can get a little loud because of the street. I just like plain coffee, and its hot and strong.   I'm a big iced tea person, and they have great ice tea. The tea isn't too sweet, the large is actually large, and the value is definitely there. Plenty of parking too. I'll keep going.

So I remember the old JB's on the corner at 19th and Bethany and out on 43rd and Indian School. The salad bar and weird brownish flecked plates were a big part of my childhood.   I hadn't been to JB's since those ones closed.   After a depressing experience at Ihop on 19th and Northern, we came to JB's to try and grab a plain meal. Nothing special.   Showed up at 8:30, about an hour and a half before they closed.   My girlfriend ordered cinnamon roll French toast, and I got a club sandwich.   Her food was real good, and she was happy. She's a pick egg eater, and was satisfied.   I'm a big club guy. I get a club wherever it is available. Their club was nothing special, and that's exactly what I was looking for. Just give me a club that's on plain toasted white bread with normal stuff. It was perfect.  Service was prompt and quick, and very nice. She brewed a new pot of decaf for me.   Place is plain. Doesn't look like its been updated since JB's switched from Maroon colors to Blue. (Remember that?)   It definitely feels like a greasy spoon in a small town. I like that.   While I am about 30 years younger than the main clientele, I'll be back.

There's a few pizza snobs on these reviews. Pizza snobs. Jeez.   Maybe y'all would be better suited to spend your cash at a papa johns or pizza hut.  Uncle Tony's is sketchy, yes. Shattered windows and dark parking lot.   The workers are a rough around the edges, yes.  The interior leaves a lot to be desired. A LOT.   Now I don't know about you all, but I will set all of that aside for a good neighborhood pizza. Uncle Tony's is a good neighborhood pizza.   Ordered: Large Pizza and Wings-I think it was 20 bucks. Added Pepperoni. That and two drinks I think the total was $26, maybe $28. That's a heck of a deal.   Wings came out quick-and were delivered to the table. Crunchy wings are my favorite, and these were good wings. 20 wings was what the deal said, I think I counted 24. Score!  Pizza came out in good timing, about 3/4 of the way through the wings. Greasy, big pizza. Good and suitable, if not exciting. Sometimes you just want a greasy pizza.  -- If you are looking for a consistent run-of-the-mill pizza, call up one of the chain places.   If you are looking for something all fancy and nice, go visit The Parlor.   If you just want a damn pizza, go to Uncle Tony's.

Went in Sunday 5/1 at 8 pm.  I know, an off time, I should expect for trouble. Restaurant probably 1/4 of the way filled.   But, Ihop is 24 hours. They should be ready at anytime.   Walked in, no one at the front. A mother and son was waiting before me and my girlfriends. She was looking through the window trying to find a staff member, and no one had come. I told her I would go to find someone. Now, its 8:05.  Walked through the restaurant-no staff. Looked into the kitchen doors, saw no one. Finally, as I'm trying to find someone, two staff come out of the kitchen.   Now its 8:08.   The staff takes the mom and the song first to sit down. He doesn't acknowledge us. He then disappears again, as does the other staff member.   8:12. We are still waiting to be seated...even acknowledged!  8:14. We leave. Go somewhere else and have a fine time.   My advice: Don't go here.

Update 3/7/16: Received a call from Andy from Rudy's. He thoroughly apologized for out experience, and did all he could to make it right. I do appreciate his call and his willingness to make the situation right. Looking forward to giving it a try again in the future.    Went there last night. Closes at 10 PM, we showed up at 8.   Last time, had a great experience. The staff was nice and attentive, and ready to help us figure out what we wanted.   This time, not so much. As soon as we went to the counter, the first thing out of the mouth was the gentleman at the counter was "here or to go" gruffly, followed by slamming down the tray on the counter. My girlfriend and I looked at each other, we knew how this was going to go. Probably should have left at that point. He then said "You're gonna order one of the ton's of stuff we don't have" so I asked about a baked potato-which we came all the way from central Phoenix to have-and he said they were out. Fine, but I deferred to my girlfriend to order so I could re-evaluate what I wanted. (At this point, she asked if I wanted to go somewhere else, I said, No we are already here. Nothing super rude about that.) We ordered, and he gruffly took it and slapped together what we ordered. Fine dude, whatever.  Food was good, but there was no flavor to the spicy chop.   After eating the sandwich, I thought I'd go up for a small green chile stew, as I wasn't full yet. I walked to the counter and the same gentleman said " what do you want" and I asked if they still had stew, or if they had run out of it. Didn't ask rudely. He looked and said yes, so I ordered some. While getting the stew, he said to the other fella behind the grill "this is one of the two that came in for stuff we didn't have, they got mad at me like it was my fault." I was a little shocked, was this guy actually taking shit about me right in front of me? He slammed down the stew in front of me and said "it's on the house" and walked away. I tried to pay for it-I don't need this asshole's charity-and he barked "NO" at me.   This was a terrible visit to a good place. I'm not going out of my way to be disrespected like that.
