From behind the scene! I am not a scorned "fired" employee. I worked there for a week! I left on my own! My name is Elizabeth! I'm a animal lover and not afraid of telling my story of working here. i was absolutely disgusted!! I've been a groomer since 2006! I applied with Terry (the owner) and got the job before I even did my "test groom". Terry called me in to do a test groom on Sunday July 28th as soon as I walked in her salon "Bow Wow" the odor was pretty bad! The ammonia smell and musty smell was pretty bad. Let me tell you why. Besides the fact she has carpet at the front door ..that fur pups will mark she uses them in the kennels as well. How often do they get cleaned you ask?? I was there a week and didn't see any cleaning of them. We the groomers wash the dogs with a pesticide pump up sprayer she mixes her "secret ingredient" shampoo of woolite (yes laundry detergent) and dawn (dish washing soap). I went to "Ryan's pet supply" and got more "pet friendly" shampoo and conditioner to use the week I was there. I refuse to us the towels. When we are done using our towels we hang them on the clothesline in the back room to "reuse" on the next dog.  No we don't wash them, I'm pretty sure we have all done it..forgot a load of laundry in the wash forgot to put in in the dryer and the stench of the clothes...that's the smell of the reused towels!! Also if you tipped your groomer when Terry (the owner) was there.. Well good 90% chance your groomer didn't get it!!! I heard it from every groomer she has pocketed tips. Seen it with my own eyes on my last day. Heard if you say anything to her she will just deny it. So why bother since I was leaving anyways! I am writing this review as a animal lover. Previous employee of this company I would not trust with my personal dogs. Oh I didn't mention holding the dogs by the ears (request client dog) and pulling her personal dogs out of the kennel by their ears because she doesn't "spoil her dogs"  she's a breeder 30+ standard poodle plus mixed breeds seen "oops" pregnancy yea it's all about the money dog business for her. She is also the owner of "shear ecstasy" !

I know you aren't expecting much from your Taco Bell however, I did call them with a concern (I'm vegetarian) the gentleman on the phone went over all the ingredients with me on the phone. Something I didn't ask for but he was willing to go the "xtra" step. Thank you! People are so quick to leave negative feedback! I challenge you to express the good as well! Thank you!

I love Italian and I eat here often. Love it! Great homemade Italian organic as well! Marco is a very nice man has been every time I've been there. They recently started doing lunch big plus!! Margarita pizza (as I call it). Yum!! The food is so great we had our company Christmas party there that night I had clams in white sauce over pasta with a spice level 1

Excellent homemade food! My husband and i are having lunch here right now for our first time and the food is so good couldn't wait to review them. So here I am eating my ravioli's and starter bread and typing. The staff is very friendly as well. We just bought a house out here at mountain bridge (having it built) this will be our restaurant of choice here! Glad we found them

Great, amazing food! I've ordered delivery from them probably 5/6 times now and just discovered them prob not even a month ago. 1 thing I order every time is their mussels on the appetizer menu i love seeing the spices ect in the "finished" product. The delivery gentlemen are great as well so polite and bring my dinner in a igloo cooler/ container to keep it warm....I love trying "independent"restaurants and this one definitely gets a 5 star because the consistency of the quality of food I've ordered in the last month!

Moved out here (mesa) from phoenix was hesitant to find a new bjj school closer to home. I am beyond happy I did. Carlos Farias team is Very friendly and I was welcomed in like family! Carlos is very one on one in training he is a active competitor along with his students and he pushes you to you limits in training. Definitely give him a try and would recommend this school to every and anyone!

Enzo is great and amazing with a lot of knowledge and experience! My boss has used him for prob 20 years now and had recommended him. He opened his new salon in the complex I work in so I decided to give him a try. Enzo listens to you and asks for feedback during the process to make sure it is what "I" wanted. You can tell he takes pride in his work and knows what he is doing. Love his accent too!
