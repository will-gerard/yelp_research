WOW try out their Lumberjack skillet - you'll either stuff yourself so much you'll fall asleep on the car ride home or you'll have leftovers for later or the next day.  I normally don't like chains, and especially diner-like chains.  But this place was definitely a good find and I left thoroughly happy.

This was my third stop on my first tour of Tempe. I came here on Friday, and was pleasantly surprised by an awesome Irish band playing, a really nice atmosphere and friendly bartenders!  I pulled up to the bar and sat down, ordered a beer and struck up a nice conversation with the bartender. I told her I had just moved here and she was more than happy to share her tips on other good places to drink!   I really loved the band playing that night, the songs were all Irish-themed and people were clapping and dancing around right in front of the stage. I can't wait to come back!

My first Yelp review!!  I came here on a Friday night and this was the first place on my first tour of Tempe (I just recently moved to Phoenix from Virginia).  I also happened to show up the first weekend that school was in session so this place was semi-packed when I walked in at 9 p.m. There was a DJ playing some decent music but the dance floor wasn't crowded at all since it was early.  I got served relatively quickly. Since I was new to the place I asked the bartender for a recommendation and he instantly told me to get the 190 Octane ($5.50)  ...I didn't know it had Everclear in it until I grabbed a menu a few minutes later and saw what was in it. Holy smokes! The drink itself was pretty strong, but easy to down because of the slushie-like consistency and orange color and taste. I definitely was feeling GOOD after I left the bar.  There's a good amount of spiked-slushies you can try, so I'll definitely be back to test out some other ones. Check out the list here: http://www.fattuesdaytempe.com/daiquiris.html

DELICIOUS BBQ, and if you're a fan of country and cowboy-themed restaurants with a large outdoor and patio area, you'll like this place. I've never been in the Cave Creek area, and while this place was pretty far from my place, it was totally worth it.   Now granted, we visited this place on a Sunday afternoon. It was dead at this time, but I've heard rumors it gets really packed Friday and Saturdays.  I got the BBQ platter, which was about $15 total (with tip) and the plate was a nice mix of pulled pork, sausage and some sort of beef strips (forget the name) it was big enough for me to save a good majority of it for leftovers the next day.  Also: They have some sort of offer where you can get a pound of food for ~$10 or something ridiculous like starting at 10 a.m, so I'll try that offer next time I'll be back...and I'll definitely be back. I'd give it five stars but it's really far away from me.

Looking for a nice dive bar in Scottsdale with a splash of Irish festivities? Look no further than Patties. This is probably the spot my friends and I head to to start our night or end it. Saying this early: I'm not sure about price but if my receipts from past weekends are any indication, it's not too expensive at all.  If you go in the early evening Patties is pretty dead and quiet but gives you free room to play pool, shuffleboard etc. After 10 p.m. rolls through, this place quickly fills up. There's plenty of places to stand and sit if you snag them early, but careful as each part of the bar can get congested and tight (especially if you're trying to move through the middle of the bar)  Music can be hit or miss. Last night I wasn't feeling the music rotation but last weekend I was all over the dance floor so just be prepared if you're looking to hit the floor here.  This is probably my go-to spot now in Scottsdale. Good atmosphere, really colorful design and a popular dive bar that doesn't come off as high-class and overpriced.

Took a date here on a Saturday afternoon. Really nice down-to-earth place with a friendly staff and warm environment. The sushi rolls were BIG, and definitely worth the price. I think they also had happy hour on Saturday as well, since I remember ordering a big beer to go with my sushi.  Definitely would come back here again. I'm not sure how service will be when it's packed, but we were served relatively quickly for our orders.

Not bad Firehouse, not bad at all...  This was my first bar I ever went to in Scottsdale. Been here twice so far.  So! The DJ's are pretty good, and while they mix it up from time to time it's primarily  a rotation of rap/electronic/dubstep and of course classics like House of Pain's "Jump Around."   The only gripe is that because this place is so popular, the dance floor crowds up really easily and it becomes an elbow match between dancers. It's hard to navigate through the mass of peoples to get to the back bar, but once you get back there there's enough space to stand around and admire the floor.  Also, the outside patio is nice and provides enough space to sit or stand to catch your breath. Drinks are decent price too.  If they had a bit more room on the floor and maybe took one or two of the couches that sit against the wall, away, it'd give more people some breathing room. Other than that though, definitely coming back to this place!

Ok so, coming from Virginia Tech, we don't have any nightclubs with go-go dancers, poles everywhere and a massive stage for DJs to scratch so this place was an eyeopener when I walked in.  First, I didn't really like the $5 cover. Call me cheap, but not sure if it was really worth it. The music was good and the beers I got were semi-cheap, but the place was too packed to move, and trying to dance on the floor was mostly an elbow fest with creepy guys trying to just get right up on girls and grind.   I felt bad for most of the women on the floor, clearly they did NOT want guys to just come up from behind and play it off. Unfortunately, none of the guys stalking the floor could tell.   I myself just danced to the music, but after a few elbows in the ribs I dipped. Not sure if I would go back again, as I could put the $5 to more drinks and not a cover. The music was good that's for sure, but the congested floor and sausage fest was not my thing at all. Pass!

Great place! The person there was quick to help, offered me a variety of shoes to try (but I went with the first one as they were having a sale and this particular shoe was 50% off!). He even gave me a heads up on when they meet to run drills at Arcadia High School's track. Definitely will come back next time I need something running related.  Just a heads up, running shoes can be expensive!

When I first came to Phoenix I was looking for a barber place that knew how to handle my type of hair. I found this guy on Yelp and haven't been to another place since. Great guy, excellent service, free drinks and candy and his shop is awesome. Definitely one-of-a-kind and warm environment.   The only thing I'd say is, because he's so popular, once he gets backed up it can be a bit of a wait. Gotta find a good time to go when there isn't a long line. I'm not surprised though because his cuts are fresh!   FYI: He only takes cash unfortunately. I forgot the first two times he cut my hair but he was trusting and let me run out to pull bills to pay. Great guy, very friendly and talkative. Try him out!

I was looking for a place to eat breakfast or lunch and thanks to Yelp I decided to try this place out.   Zookz has a really relaxing atmosphere, owner is very friendly and helpful. I got the #25 which consisted of ham, tomatoes, avocados, black beans, shredded cheddar cheese and chipotle sauce. Portion size was good for the price too ($7 and some change for the sandwich).  All menu items sounded delicious, and the sandwiches come with either chips or kale salad (for all you kale lovers). I'd definitely come back here again and hope to try out the breakfast items next time.  Bonus tip: Check in on foursquare and you'll receive 15% discount. It's a May deal only so I highly suggest you check this place out and get the discount!

Not sure when they added a dress code, but I don't recall it being around when it first opened. It was news to me this weekend. Saturday night my jeans were called "too baggy" even though other guys inside the bar were wearing the same kind of jeans. Great eyes, bouncer.  Then today I came in during the day and was turned around because they didn't consider my "flip flops" as "sandals" yet there again, guys standing in the outside patio were wearing similar open-toed sandals.   This place is usually really cool spot for drinks and music but the dress code gives bouncers justification to make up stupid reasons up to turn you around. I understand dress standards but when you get down to criticizing what sandals & jeans look like you've hit a low.
