So far so good...had a brake job and oil change and very very satisfied. They completed the car repairs when promised, and they did not just automatically say I needed new rotors like the dealership always does!!

My girlfriend took her 1995 Toyota Land Cruiser in to get the Valve Cover gasket replaced, and the shop said the vehicle was too high off the ground to work on the engine. So they removed the tires to lower the vehicle and then rested it on the brake rotors. My girlfriend almost had a heart attack when she saw that. Then they split the cold air intake tube and said for $200 they could replace it. We both have Toyota Land Cruisers and we will never return to this shop.

My wife went by herself to Moon Valley Nursery not having a clue what all she wanted. Julie Bemis, one of the employees/sales team, talked to my wife and then offered up to come out to our house to help scope out our front yard plant situation. Julie came out to the house on time as promised (she even called ahead of time), and was extremely friendly and knowledgeable. Julie then scheduled time for us to meet with her at the Nursery to go over all the plant selection. My wife was not thrilled at some of the plants that we had originally agreed on, and Julie had no problems coming up with new ideas and didn't make us feel pressured at all. We also went round and round with our BIG purchase that was in a 36 inch wooden frame. We must have looked at the different Fan Palms for about 30 minutes before we could make a decision. All the time, Julie was super casual/cool about it. We set a date for the Nursery to come plant, they were on time, professional and gave my wife lots of good advice. One of my only complaints is that they were skimpy with the mulch, and I was hoping for another bottle of Moon Juice for the money I spent with them. I probably should have understood the return policy better because I bought insurance on the extremely expense Fan Palm, so somehow I need to figure that part out. I have talked to a few people and they say they have been burned by MVN, but from what I can see, they have been very open/honest. Thanks again Julie Bemis for helping us get our front yard put into good shape!!

I forgot how awesome this place is. I used to come for lunch with vendors back in the day, and made a last minute decision to book reservations for NYE. The place was absolutely packed, but we got our table about 10 minutes after our scheduled reservation which wasn't bad. My crew of people were loving the food, and we were completely stuffed. We had food to bring home and it was just as good the next day! Love this place and can't wait to go back!!

Every time I come here it takes forever. Other cars pull in after me to be dried off and they get service before mine. I guess I need an expensive car to get dried off quicker!

This used to be a great little bar and I am not sure what happened to it. My daughter has gone in 2 or 3 times now and she consistently gets bad service and she suspects it is because she is a teenager (17). They have over charged her, double charged her debit card, and just given her poor service. So I decided to go with her the other night to get a bite to eat and waitress #1 shows up, takes our drink order, then waitress #2 shows up with our drinks and says she is now our waitress. She brought our Onion Rings/Fries out cold and I had to send them back. She took forever in swinging by the table to check on us. They brought out the MOAB brownie without any spoons. It just went on and on. I never used to get service like that there and I did not recognize any of the managers that used to be there. They won't be getting any of my money in the future.

Fantastic atmosphere. Very Very friendly staff. Food presentation was spot on.  We had drinks and a Brick Oven Flatbread (cheese) and it was delicious. I can't wait to go back and try a full entree. They had a Salmon dish on the menu I am going to try when I return. I was staring at other dishes and they looked mouth watering.

When I first went to this store, the people and service were great. That was in 2008. Since then the service and people have gone WAY downhill. I have literally spent probably 2K on jeans there for myself and my daughter since 2008. Now fast forward to 2009/2010 and the employees have become a bit snobby with some attitude. If you do not like their suggestions on Jeans, suddenly you get hit with attitude. This never used to be the case back in the day. Just the other week I was in the store and was looking for some size 30 waist jeans, and the sales lady literally pushed the size 31's on me, said they could take in the waist and everything would be just find. She said they do it all the time and I wouldn't be able to tell the difference. So being the dumb guy that doesn't know much about taking in clothes, I believed her. I should not have listened to her at all. I got the jeans and they didn't fit in the waist, and they did something to the pockets of the jeans that made them look like my Grandma's jeans. I was horrified. I went back to the store to complain after trying them on at home, and I got attitude from one of the male sales people about how "That is how it is always done"....I wasn't real happy to hear that. I then spoke with someone of more authority, and the best she could do was give me a card of the people that screwed up the jeans in the first place. She said I could call, make an appointment with them, and maybe she could fix them to my liking.  So I will just take the jeans to another person and see if they can be fixed or not. But I will never ever ever return to Scottsdale Jean Company to buy Jeans again. My daughter and I both have decided that if you are going to have attitude with a customer that is spending big bucks, we will take our bucks elsewhere!! They are not the only game in town, that's for sure.

I have been there twice now, once for just drinks, and once for food and drinks. Food was excellent, nice large portions, but not crazy. Staff was friendly and attentive. I like the fact that I can eat there at 10:30pm when most other places are closed!! I can't wait to try the patio some night, it was just a bit too cold for me at 10:30pm, even though they had outdoor heaters.  Definitely making this a regular stop for me.

Took my 17 year old daughter and my parents to dinner last night (Wednesday Night). My Dad couldn't stop talking about how great the place was, and my mom had a good time which was a surprise. My daughter and I love the place, and it didn't disappoint as usual. The beer isn't Four Peaks, but not having to drive to Tempe, I am cool with that. Burgers were fantastic. The atmosphere is what makes this place, and the friendly staff. The manager, Denny (I think), is a total rock star. She remembered me from my last visit, and remembered what our conversation was about. These are the reasons why people return to a business. It's not always about how great the beer is and how wonderful the food is. In my book, first class friendly staff wins every time! I am a customer for as long as I live out here in the burbs!

Here is a weird review. They didn't fix my car, but it is the best place I have been for car repairs in a long time. I have a Toyota Land Cruiser that has a brake system issue, and Tim looked at it for 2 days and determined that I would be better off taking it to an independent Toyota Expert since he was not the most familiar with the ever so expensive Toyota brake system on my vehicle. He did charge up my batter for me, but never charged me a dime. Why can't they all be this honest!!

No real atmosphere at all. Bar was constructed like a Kitchen Counter. Great TV's. I-Hop style menu. Staff was busy talking to each other most of the time I was there. I give the place another 6 months top to survive.

My first time visiting this place and it was a great experience. We didn't have reservations, but the host was getting ready to seat 4 people to a table and that they would be freeing up 4 people from the bar, so BAM, we got seated at the bar in about 2 minutes. Branden was the bartender/waiter and was an absolute crack up. The food was fresh, drinks were great, and there is no reason not to go back.
