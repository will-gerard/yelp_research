What kind employees in Charlotte! I received more "have a nice days" than Forrest Gump could ever have imagined! These folks are happy at their jobs....the food prep folks, cashiers, washroom attendants, and airline peeps working the gates must all be drinking the same joyful water! This airport is clean, organized, and roomy enough for a good amount of traffic to not feel cramped. And the rocking chairs in the common areas that still have all the modern conveniences for charging the toys makes it feel like home away from home. No wonder everyone was ordering smaller lattes that day - the warmth of this airport already had them feeling cozy :)

This is one of my favorite escapes from the city while still within the city! I've lived in AZ for a year and have been visiting DBG on average once a month since my arrival in the serenity of the Sonoran. The way the plants take on a different character and color at various times throughout the year.....lovely! The paths are well-maintained, the staff and volunteers all seem to enjoy their surroundings, and the guests of all ages seem as contented as I feel while meandering through cacti, succulents, grasses, herbs, flowering plants, and the AWESOME SCULPTURES that just pop a color into view at the best turns!   I have a few events on my calendar for this coming Fall, including Music in the Garden, and I will definitely be taking more houseguests to DBG as part of my "AZ favorites" tour :)  I was impressed with the Butterfly Pavilion when we visited on 4/9/13.....plenty of species to get up close and personal with! My nephew also got a kick out of the flashlight tour that we enjoyed in May of this year.......get there to get out of the city!

I was so amused with the storyline of Don Quixote, played out in this ballet performance! I expected to enjoy the story of the lost lovers of all ages, shapes, and sizes.....I never expected to giggle so much at the ballet, though! What fun! The costumes were gorgeous and had just the right "spice" for the period while still showing the fluid movement of the dance. The orchestra did an amazing job with the score in a hall that is well-receiving of this type of sound.  This performance was the weekend before Valentine's Day. It was obvious that there were lovers there, enjoying a special theatre treat in honour of their holiday. But there were also plenty of families there with young girls of all ages enthralled with the story - and the audience as a whole was happy to show moments of joy and laughter where the company xpected it!

There are different reasons people are first drawn to a yoga studio and different reasons why they decide to return. I've visited many studios at times in my life when I needed a new energy, a new light, or a new experience. This studio came into my life after a big move and the timing was perfect..... Yoga "to join" Pura "home"......this is my home where I join body with spirit, where I find union with the Universe, where I commune with friends. The RYT500-certified instructors are all well-versed in various styles of strong, nurturing, healing, and invigorating techniques. I have enjoyed the space immensely during morning, midday, and evening classes. Love yourself enough to visit Yoga Pura :)

Ok, so we know it's a chain and have seen plenty of locations everywhere. I'm giving a full 4 stars for this location because of the manager on duty the day I visited. The employees were all kept busy and the orderliness of the place showed that. I was hesitant to try the fish tacos because I'm just getting into fish (kinda) and usually chicken-out, literally, when it comes to tacos! But, the manager was so friendly and helpful and descriptive of what I would find when I tried the special, that I couldn't resist. Glad I couldn't! Delish, even for being "slightly fishy", and a nice spicy flavor with the mango salsa relish stuff!

It takes 32 minutes.  (The time needed to get from SW baggage claim to the curbside pick-up to the highway to the very first stop on my every trip to Phoenix - authentic Mexican food at Alberto's....I mean, El Tio....same diff...and good at any location. They'll tell you they're different and that there is some type of territorial feud going on between the two locally-operated chains. But, don't believe the hype....they just like to give you reason to keep jumping back and forth between both their great menus! Go for the burritos, stay for the chips with pseudo-guac and homemade salsas!)

I'm giving 4 stars because I just love to find this many artifacts of the basket and clay varieties when I visit a museum. It really amazes me, the craftmanship of our ancient peoples! This small museum is not part of the Science Museum circuit, so I wasn't able to use my discount or member card, but for $6 I felt it was worth the trip to check it out. Some exhibits in the kids' room have been duplicated and enhanced in the main museum hall, which was fun to compare. The outdoor area is actually a preserved portion of a reservation belonging to the Hohokum Indians and there are examples of the water distribution canals and housing styles from 300 years ago along the Salt River, AZ. Great, informative afternoon!

I'd never been to this location before. With a Yard House, Wolfley's, and a BJ's in the same lot, there is enough competition of the same style place that I would have thought it to be par with those. Or maybe this is something different altogether, which explains the lack of charisma and personality :/  We went in for a late lunch (2 p.m.) on a Thursday. Besides our party of two, there was a family of 4 in the dining room and 2 guests in the bar area. We were seated by a waiter that hasn't learned to smile, served by the same smile-less waiter, and otherwise we only saw a bartender on staff during the visit.   The menu seemed to have plenty of choices, but we kept it light and simple. My friend ordered the sliders, medium, and they came out well done with absolutely no toppings or sauces or cheese. Is that normal? She dealt with it. I ordered the lemon rice that was missing anything tasting lemon-y and the black beans that actually had a nice spice to them. We had iced teas, which we were drinking quite quickly since they were weak enough to taste more like water, and I think it made the server upset to have to refill them so many times.  Weird experience for an empty chain restaurant.....I would think a server and kitchen staff stuck on that shift would want to make enough of an impression to bring people back at that same time in the future :/  Meh :/

Just picked up the chariot with new brakes, major tune-up, enhanced audio system, & better suspension than ever before!  Thank you, Mel, for turning a bad situation right around. Your class & style redeemed this service department once again today.

I love to see so many parking spaces filled at this great little park! I walked around the great path, checked out some pups at the dog park, and delighted in watching the antics of some of our fine feathered friends....ducks, swans....oh, and snow birds, too! It's a perfect day for some light reading in the shade while waiting for more LYFT requests! Life is good in Scottsdale, AZ....the most liveable city!

Too bad, so sad.....this smaller market chain needs to jump into high gear with employee training if they're gonna stay in the game. I like having a smaller canvas of grocery aisles sometimes....not every store needs to be SUPERsize....but this store is right down the street from a Safeway, a Wal-Mart SuperStore, and a Fry's....these stores all have way more variety and efficient systems and employees. It's just my humble opinion, but if I can get in and out of a 22-aisle market faster than a 14-aisle market, there is something worth looking into by the management.

Based on my two visits** to this location so far, I'd say a 5-star rating is totally fair. This is primarily due to the outstanding service by Courtney on both cut and color. She is so attentive and friendly that I followed her from another FS location at the other side of town. There is just something comforting about knowing that a professional stylist is really listening to your ideas, your short and long term hair goals! Seriously, I'd been made to feel at other salons in the past that I was t-r-o-u-b-l-e (to quote Travis Tritt right there!), but Courtney made me feel safe in the arms of love (to quote his friend Martina McBride).  In my case, when I first met Courtney, I felt I was at the point of needing corrective color because of the damage I'd done and the abrupt changes I sometimes make....blonde, red, dark brown, back to red, maybe some highlights ha ha! But, Courtney assessed the situation and not only gave me a rich and nurturing color that matched just what we discussed, but she also didn't make me feel bad for being a human :) As for the cut, she understood that I wanted to look well put-together without having to spend more than 7 minutes in front of a mirror. After kindly explaining to me that I might need to prioritize or pay her to come style my hair every morning, we decided on a cut that's sassy but can be pulled into my favorite ponytail quickly.  I plan on going back....we have so many more lengths and colors in the spectrum to visit together! :()  **First visit April 2014 **Second visit June 2014

I'm going for a 4, but I really feel this is more of a 3.5.....better to over-state than under in fairness.  My first visit was a to-go order. The phone call seemed to go almost too smoothly. That should have been my first clue. One order had chopped sausage inside the omelette, instead of links ON THE SIDE. The second order had shell pieces in the fried egg. The third order was for fresh fruit (I asked specifically if there were berries) and instead was fresh melon and orange wedges! I will say the muffins were amazing as always and totally worth going off my gluten-free restriction for!  Second visit was because the manager was quick to want to resolve the first debacle - nice job, Fernando! Very professional in his approach and made it easy for me, at my convenience, to come by for a do-over :) HOWEVER, although the food was exactly as we ordered for this breakfast, we got to hear the waitress calling out that her customers said their food was to be comped.....calling out across the whole dining room! WTH?! Not so professional on that level :(  All said, my impression is that the manager knows he has a kitchen and wait staff that might be rough around the edges and also understands customer loyalty is critical to a good business model.  I'll return for lunch and see if we can't make this a solid 4 stars or even 5 :)

A big shout-out to Travis for helping take the headache out of replacing the lighting in our latest project!  All of the folks working at the counter are helpful, friendly, & knowledgeable. I couldn't even get impatient with the customer in front of me who kept asking additional questions, because to be honest I wanted to stay all day and talk about lighting, too!  A great consumer experience all around.  At a time I had almost run out of hope finding a specialty bulb, this place came to my rescue!

Awesome bar staff, great space overall for a group gathering or just a date with a cupla friends. The kitchen was SUPER COOL to me on the day we visited (1/11/15) as they subbed the two fried eggs with scrambled egg whites for me on my brunch order (since the kitch was actually post-brunch crowd.) YAAAAY for feeling special and WOW for feeling so full that half my lunch was taken away for lunch the next day! Great flavors on that plate.....I gotta learn how to make beans like that....and enchiladas like that.....and crispy potatoes like that.....everything, really ;)

We visited on NYE and what a PLEASANT experience it was for us! We had put our name in online, got seated within 10 minutes of arriving which was 20 minutes before our saved time.  The hostess was joyful and handling the holiday pressure really well. The server was attentive but not in our faces too much, actually suggested one of my favorite wines, and was quick when it came time to pay the bill.  The food was cooked to perfection (we both tried the portabello filet with garlic mashed and steamed veggies.) The only food item that could have been done better was the asparagus; it was a bit tough. We carried a slice of raspberry cheesecake home with us for later and enjoyed that, too!  Throughout the visit, the manager was checking on her employees and complimenting them on their attention to the needs of the restaurant, which I think was a great morale booster! I'm so happy to say our last meal of 2014 was a wonderful experience on so many levels!

Okay, you know what's cute? A group of wholesome-looking teens dressed in soda counter garb and serving all-American treats to overheated tourists and locals alike.....that's cute! This place has a bit of that "throw-back" feel with the soda fountain options that you just don't see very much anymore. I had the Gold Rush, which consisted of orange sherbet, vanilla ice cream, and Sprite all blended into a 50/50 bar-esque sippable yumminess. My son really enjoyed his chocolate shake but wished there was 3 times more of it (teens...can't live with 'em, can't ever fill 'em up!) The establishment was clean and quirky and, frankly, over-staffed for that time of day...but, hey! better than the alternative, which happens all too often in this tourist town!  If you're so inclined, the PHX Big Entertainment Book has a BOGO coupon for any menu item at the Sugar Bowl :)

For the money.....great job! I don't know what I like more, the option to sub white rice with brown or the spa-like music playing at just the right level. The bamboo shades & slatted seats (however counter-service the place is otherwise) really made this eatery feel relaxing and soft and COOL on a warm day :) I wasn't sure what my taste buds really wanted that day. I played it safe and ordered something I could compare easily to other restaurants: Teriyaki chicken bowl was tasty & lite. I would have used a bit more sauce, but i tend to do that anyway, so maybe it was par for a good bowl presentation. They offer Bento box, some sushi, lots of veggie and fish options, and a kind approach to service with authentic smiles :) **Visit was 7/20/12

So happy this worked into this visit to Scottsdale! We had tried the Far North Scottsdale location last year when we visited and I FELL IN LOVE...no joke, I would have it shipped to my home in MN if I thought it would travel well. But, alas, the best thing about coal-fired pizza is that you don't want to travel any distance or in any rush....just slowly take in the aroma and the flavour....and, if you're a fan of libations, a Peroni washes this down nicely at lunch as does a deep Cab Sauv at night :) I'm always happy to find red-and-white tablecloths in a pizza parlour....maybe sounds cheesy (ha!), but it just puts a smile on my face! The lunchtime hostess at this location was really excited about her job, the food, and the weather - what a great smile she has and how very welcoming she was that day for this party of one! I sat in the bar, was greeted promptly by a great waitress who knew exactly how much time to allow for decisions, and I ordered a personal pizza with 'choke hearts and kalamata olives. It came to the table sliced into 6 pieces and I honestly could have been finished after 2....but why would I deprive myself while on vacation? DUH! So, I ate a third slice and took half of the pizza back to our condo for a future snack.....lucky future snack tummies unite! Do your family a favor and take them to Grimaldi's :()

I must say, for the low price of 2 drinks each, I think this is a decent night out. I mean, some of these stand-ups could GO BIG really soon! I'm a fan of comedy clubs, generally. When a room full of people just want to laugh together, doesn't that make it somewhat of a win from the start?! Admittedly, there have been a few creatures that obviously slid right through the screening process and right onto the stage.....I mean, I don't want to hear about the slimy details of your life for the benefit of a laugh (bodily functions are really never that funny to me, especially in a dinner theater)....but, for the most part, it's been a positive experience at Tempe Improv. We ordered wings and crudités and got what we were expecting....nothing amazing about them, but temperature and speed of delivery to table were excellent. Sat at the stage on two different visits and I really think that beats having to share a bigger table with strangers and have to turn chairs to be comfy for a 2-hour show. These visits ranged between December 2011 & January 2012; late review catch-up night by this critic ;[]

Great group of folks, very helpful, seemed to enjoy their environment. Happy to support a local shop, wish the one closest to my house in MN had the same cushy mushy feelings when I walked in the door.....but, I'm glad I found just that here while on vacay  :) 2 bikes tuned & cleaned up including 1/2 inch layer of salt from traveling across country on the back of the Land Rover, 2 flats fixed, 1 gear replaced......and we, just like Willie Nelson, are ON THE ROAD AGAIN! This review is based on a visit 1/31/11.

I can't say that I've tried anything from the menu except Coronas....but, I must say they opened those REALLY WELL! I plan on going back for lunch before I leave town at the end of my winter stay....I'll update my yelpin' at that time! We've gone two Friday nights in a row now for the bull-riding - it's just something I would NEVER otherwise think to go see, but now I'm kinda hooked :) Plus, seeing all those Stetsons, Wranglers, and Tony Lamas put me back in the Country mood that I'd been missing and didn't know it :) There were guests of all ages for the 8:00 bull-riding fun....I'm thinking the crowd changes with the later shows? There was a great band playing some covers inside while we were there, also...great job on the Chesney songs! Whoot! Whoot! for Buffalo Chip!

Well, I really wanted to find a great place for lunch while in Carefree, AZ one day.....I guess I'll have to keep looking :( It would have been nice if EITHER of the ladies working in the dining room seemed happy to see me. It would have been nice if I wasn't over-charged for a skimpy, wimpy BLT with not-so-fresh avocado and the crumbs from the bottom of the Lay's potato chip bag. It would have been nice if the other customers, at least, looked happy with their orders as they arrived or by the time they finished.  But none of this happened on the day I visited. Bummer for me.

I. Can't. Say. Enough. Good. Things. Here. Let's start with OVER 2000 wines in their Wine Bible!  Ahhh, Valentino, why do you have to be so very far from my reach on a regular basis? Oh, I know, because you are meant for special occasions and that's what brought us to you in the first place!  We were celebrating a WIN in Vegas....no, not cash, silly....a DIFFERENT kind of win - the end of a productive and promising Trade Expo that left us hungry for good red wine and unparalleled vegetarian fare in a refined yet comfortable atmosphere.....cue Valentino! Our server, Adrian, a Johnny Depp-esque creature with immaculate timing and menu advice, helped us put together a trio of pastas that delighted us to NO END....seriously, one bite was bliss, knowing I had a whole plateful was HEAVEN. The fresh ingredients were so obviously abundant in each flavor combination, yet all blended together so well in the various sauces and pasta fillings. The gnocchi, in particular, was so silky smooth and perfectly sized to mix with the fresh pesto sauce, that I would still be dragging the meal out now, a week later, if I thought I could be away from my family for that much longer!  This all followed a scrumptious appetizer-gone-spunky version of eggplant parmesean that was topped with fresh curly, peppery herbs. This ALL was accompanied by a merlot that was suggested by the sommelier after we had deposited our request for woodsy-earthy-cheesy-veggie items....he found a perfect match! I would be leaving you without a kiss good-bye if I didn't take a minute to explain just how a fabulous dessert followed this amazing meal. Picture rich-without-overpowering chocolate, nutty yet mild hazelnut, and silky essence of pistachio all meeting up to delight the senses in the form of mini-2-bite nougat desserts (there were other varieties available...I think a creme brulee and a fruit tarte among other things...but these morsels we decided on were a perfect compliment to the sparkling rose that was suggested by none other than Johnny Depp himself! (Okay, maybe it was Adrian - he knows this is all in good fun and filled with love - and, yes, he was pre-warned the review would include the reference!)

Love these little gems....it's my first stop for indulgence once I land in Sin City for a weekend of vices! LOL!   The dark chocolate is much better than the milk and there are some filled with the most luscious liqueurs. I bring these as souvenirs to my nieces and nephews all the time. Not sure why I'm never asked to babysit anymore.   Anywho, get chocolates and get drunk ---- need I say more?!

Eeeewwww.  Eeeewwww. Super gross. Why would I EVER subject my body to wearing clothing or shoes that have been kicked around several times and are, essentially, in their final resting place?! Do yourself a favor.....pay full price at a moderately priced store instead of this joke of a flea market. The labels may not say "high fashion runway" when purchased at the local mall stores, but they are decidedly more sanitary than the threads lining this dungeon.

The mall of malls, for sure! So many designer boutiques, so little time! On this trip, I was given the utmost in attention from the fabulous women at the Fossil store....what fun they were! I enjoyed a smoked chicken & black bean salad @ Z Tejas next and the service was excellent. I then perused the new styles at Aqua before finding a great pair of shades at Solstice = shopper's bliss :) This review is a bit late; I visited the center on 1/27/12 - and I'll be back :)

The only thing holding me back from a 5-star rating was the price of the tickets....however, considering it's Vegas, it is definitely par for the course there. I really feel like these shows could be about 30% cheaper to be sure to fill the theaters every time....it seems a waste otherwise for such talent to go unseen!  The Blue Man Group is one that I'd had on my list of "want to's" for several years now. The problem was that most of my friends had already seen it and didn't want to miss out on seeing something new and unique each time we flew into town. So, I was beginning to think I would have to go it alone. Thankfully, on my last trip, I was finally with someone in the group who ALSO was waiting for another newbie to want to see it - so we induldged as first-timers together!  I'm so glad I finally got to see what all the hubub was about - these guys really work well together and kept the audienced engaged by sheer confusion as to what to expect next!  The show is definitely family-friendly, all-age fun = my favorite type in Vegas because it gets you away from all the other naughty-vice-driven theater for a couple of hours :) Alas, I've only seen the show once, however I guess I checked in when I bought the tix and again when it was showtime - I'll have to go back and make an honest Yelp outta this one!

I think I would be here every afternoon possible if I lived in the vicinity on a full-time basis (we're just here visiting)....cause I love me some live music and beers in the sunshine! I also love me some feeling like Hoss Cartwright may just come through with guns blazing at any time - it's just so BONANZA! Of course, he wouldn't....he lives at the Ponderosa, which is way up north somewhere! But, this western watering hole is similar to that - good stuff!  We didn't have any food, we went to GF right after lunch somewhere else....but, the people around us were biting into some yummy-looking fare. I asked how the burgers & fries were, and got a "thumbs up" from the couple sharing our table. I found it amusing that the bouncers' tasks included having to get photogs down from standing on the picnic benches for their pics! I get the safety thing; it just seemed funny when a big, beautifully burly man in a black shirt walked over and pointed to the ground in the middle of Granny's family shot :()

I really need to plan my trips better................why do I always try to find parking in Old Town on a Saturday afternoon?!  Don't I realize that's prime time for a cerveza @ Agave Tequila?! Do I forget so easily that's when the tourists love a taste of goodness from The Sugar Bowl?! Would I be redundant by stating it's the best time for a veggie plate at Pita House? Or housemade lahvosh at The Grapevine? I'll say this......the roundabout way of finding a parking spot is totally worth it for any of the above! And don't even get me started on the shopping / galleries / people-watching activities! THIS can be a great Saturday (or any day) afternoon for locals and tourists and snowbirds alike :)

Visited 5/18/13........better late than never with a review?!  Slower service I'm told was because she was checking on my peanut allergy concern.....since I was unemployed at the time, I was not in a rush. Well-rounded menu with items outside of the regular Mexican food restaurant menus....I had grilled chicken two ways: Baja style and Oaxaca style, black bean corn enchiladas, and plenty of yummy chips with salsa. It was a nice day on the patio, except the paper napkins and even a few sugar packets were blowing everywhere and there didn't really seem to be a location protocol for sudden unexpected winds! No problemo - magnifico tasty food, service with a smile!

FOR THE PRICE......I've definitely had better :(  I almost didn't order pasta since the menu had such an amazing diversity to it.....but, the server reccommended the special so I gave in.....to a salty, otherwise-unflavorful pasta with baby artichokes and not much else going on...seriously tasted like someone used the wrong measuring spoon in the kitchen :(  I should have said something at the time, but it was our anniversary and we were trying to get to a show afterward....plus, it's taken a full week for me to reflect on why I didn't speak up sooner.... I was intimidated by how I thoguht it should have tasted..like, maybe it was MY TASTEBUDS that were faulty! My husband's dish of spaghettini with lobster was above-average, but again pricey even for Vegas standards :() I will say that the 3-Beet Salad was fab, I could eat that house-made ricotta every day....and I even loved the sparkling wine that was suggested...but, again, over-priced. I do enjoy Mario Batalli on television; not so much the flavors of this restaurant.

Huge fan! So happy there are several locations and the flavor and quality is consistent with each of them! The Mediterranean chicken salad is phenomenal....as in, bring a friend to share this abundance of flavor. I've also tried the hummus with grilled chicken appetizer (served with cucumber slices if you want to keep it lighter than pita), the chicken curry, and the blue corn nachos which were different because of the tzatziki sauce and cilantro hummus I added to the plate :) All in all, a fun place for lunch or a casual dinner. They have happy hour 7 days a week and I think they all have actual bars to sit at, although the one at this address is a limited space small bar. The bar and long high table at the Tatum location is probably a better bet for happy hour.

What an unexpected treat! Since we were visiting the area, we weren't sure who to ask to find good Chinese food. We tried a different restaurant at the other side of this same parking lot and had average reviews to make about it. The next go-round, we decided to give Canton Dragon a try.....YAY for us! The appetizers were on happy hour prices, quite tasty....but the Orange Chicken was the star of the show for this dinner! Yummy, just the right amount of sweet with a kick. My only concern was my peanut allergy that I warned the waitress about but she failed to keep me from the lettuce wraps until I was a few bites in :( Thankfully, my taste buds are designed to kick out the alarm before an E.R. visit was necessary! And the server was oh-so-sorry for the misstep that it all ended just fine. Will definitely go back to try more half-price yummies during happy hour!

Ya know what makes a great meal? A great server! Our party of 3 was new to this "Gourmet Mexican Food" location, so we had questions. Plus, we knew we wanted antojitos, platos de carne, y postres........we needed the option to SHARE so many plates :() Our server, Durango, made it happen! He was ready with all the answers, was alerted to and wary of my peanut allergy, and set up all plates to share effortlessly....platters, large plates, side plates....perfect! To be fair, if the food hadn't been good, I probably would have written about the service anyway. But, the food was fabulous, so double score!! We had chili con queso, chicken enchiladas, machaca tacos, and then there was dessert........a warm, almost on the under-baked-side-which-is-so-sinful-walnut-brownie that was served with vanilla ice cream and Mexican brandy butter sauce. Delish & delightful - a great find while on our mini vacation in Scottsdale!

OMG, I've only been once (well, twice, but only for kettle chips and a soda the first time)....so, I have yet to try the amazing menu "en totale"....but, rest assured, I'll give it my darndest and you'll be the first to know about my findings :) I had a wrap (gave in to a bit o' wheat that day, although I'm trying to stay on a wheat-free path)...it was fresh and flavorful but not overly filling = just right! The descriptions of some of the other choices, plus the amazing selection of cookies, makes for a great catering tray, I just bet! Look at some of the other Yelpers' photos for some idea of just what you have in store here!

Leave time for parking & foot traffic! Otherwise, once you're settled in the area, this venue is in a great location and close to restaurants and coffee shops for before or after the performance!  The box office is easily accessible and well-designed. The ushers were all very helpful and knowledgeable of the area as well as the hall itself.  I attended the Phoenix Ballet, "Don Quixote", and it was a marvelous afternoon performance in a nicely appointed venue!

I love when I can go to a specialty store that I have no connection with on a regular basis, and with that "deer in the headlamps" look, only to be greeted by a happy and energetic individual who wants to share their knowledge and love of all things fabric and craft without making me feel like I'll be left to drown in a sea of linens and rick-rack!  I went to JoAnn one evening last week as a last-ditch effort to save my entertainment console. You see, if I had to live one more day looking at the cords and wires and antenna parts hanging down the back open spaces of the unit, I was going to have to say "hasta la bye-bye" to the dated and oh-so-heavy piece of furniture. My plan: find a low cost solution to "hide" the culprits in time for another gathering at my home where others would also be subjected to the awful sight. My solution, as evidenced by a vigorous helping of "atta girl!" from the cutting counter staff: Simple, wrinkle-free, crease-free, not-too-heavy and not-too-sheer black fabric that could be manipulated across, over, and around the unsightly sight!  YAAAY!   And a bonus Yay came in the form of them asking if I had a coupon....to which I frowned and said NO.....to which they recommended I quickly download the JoAnn app and use the coupon that comes with it = 40% off any one item!   Happy crafty non-crafter here!

Protein style well-done.....going, going, gone! Every time it's the same for me.....the grilled onions are a MUST! Just recently, I added the indulgence of Animal-style fries to the order. I'll never go without again! As for the chain, I know what to expect and am never disappointed. As for this location, I was greeted with a smile, given prompt service, and found a nice clean booth to have one of my favorite fast-food  lunches when visiting AZ.

I have been avoiding Lowe's for about 3 years. After spending too much time and money there after my last residential move, I decided to call it quits. I was determined to prove to myself that, by going to Home Depot instead, I would stick to a list of essentials and work with employees who had been better trained in home improvement projectss. That wasn't the best plan of action, I discovered. First of all, they are not the same type of store whatsoever. My bad. Secondly, the nimrods at HD have been less than stellar in performance, professionalism, or courtesy in my humble experience. And third, Lowe's has VARIETY! I'm not a contractor, electrician, or plumber....I'm a homemaker who likes choices in lighting, shelving, cabinet hardware, and holiday decor!  On this specific visit, I had called the store first to check stock on an item that neither  Home Depot or Ace Hardware carried.....the department employee knew not only the aisle/location for me to visit when I came in, but also the varieties available and which ones were currently low on stock! Bless him & bless Lowe's for still being there when I finally came to my senses.....and just in time for the holidays :[]

Earlier this week, we used our handy Google mobile app to locate what we hoped was authentic Mexican food. We were craving flavorful salsa and well-spiced meat dishes after a long, warm day in the desert. What we found here was slightly different than we were expecting......The chips were made of corn AND flour tortillas, which was a nice surprise but way too filling while waiting for our food. The salsa was just fresh tomatoes with some cilantro (or maybe even parsley?) for color. It was "Taco Tuesday", which here meant all-you-can-eat of crunchy or soft with 3 different filling choices."Hamburger Helper-esque flavored shredded beef tacos", according to my teen son. Ooops :( I ordered the "award-winning green chili sweet tamale". I fear they left the winners with the judges, for they didn't make it to my table. The tamales were dry and contained about a tablespoon of chopped chiles throughout. And, although they were sweet as promised, they lacked depth of flavour overall. The service was fine and the refills on soft drinks was fair, but I really was hoping for more. We are in town for a couple of weeks and may try it one more time since it's close to our accommodations, but with all these Tex-Mex and MexiCali flavour houses to choose from, it will take a lot to win us over for a better review.

We started with chicken potstickers....then proceeded with the best chicken egg foo yung I've ever experienced....fresh peas & carrots added a wonderful texture! Also, the honey chicken was light & not-too-sweet as an accompaniment to our feast for 3! Very complimentary service, kind & humble waitstaff with impeccable timing.  Go get your Chinese on!

Love love love these folks! Okay, so I may be a bit biased about the chain as a "whole"......the very first time I absorbed everything fabulous about Whole Foods was while I was in NYC on my honeymoon. All positive, happy, sensual memories from that trip including our meanderings through Whole Foods.... ....but, I digress......THIS WF location in Phoenix made me oh-so happy all over again :) They do a great job with the hot food bar, the bakery is well-stocked with FABULOUS treats for all meals and occasions, and I always take time to look at the new items in the vast gluten-free section. As an added bonus, their wine selection is a nice inventory of reds, especially. I was so thankful to find help with the shelf-stable probiotics when the section looked so different than my regular location back home in MN....the nutrition specialist knew just how to address some of my other concerns with supplements, also.  We made a special trip to the gelato counter one night after leaving the gym nearby and, let me say, honey lavender gelato is a sin worth induldging in!  **Visits 1/22/11 - 2/1/11

As of April 2014...at least at this location....Now serving almond milk! 5 stars for almond milk! Still not a huge fan of ice blended anything, but the hot & steamy dark roast with almond milk hits the spot some days!

Go for the top shelf margs.....stay for the drunken chicken nachos! OMG! Wonderful favors and such huge portions! I think the location of this eatery, just steps from the latest in slots play, has to be taken into consideration in advance. It's not a place to feel like you've escaped the strip for a quiet meal! However, it's DEFITINTELY a place for a good time, some incredible munch-ables, and an easy transition back to the gaming floor!

"You ever see an Eskimo pee?" ......that was the question being asked by the chef to his coworkers when he should have been checking the temperature, texture, and overall edibility of his kitchen's food. This place needs some SERIOUS ATTENTION IMMEDIATELY. We ordered chips & salsa....one dish of salsa was cold, the other was room temperature. Neither were great. Our plates arrived and I immediately sent the "shredded beef" taco back and asked them to take it off the bill. The meat was grey and cool. As for my chicken salad, the meat was unseasoned and the chop was too big for the cucumber & tomato. There was no dressing. My son ordered pork enchiladas with the beans on a side plate.......no side plate, beans touching his enchiladas. He said he'd deal with it but watching him try to enjoy the almost inedible "pork" (still unsure if it was chicken instead) was a struggle in itself. My first Corona had been the only joy in the lunch, so I ordered another. Mistake. The second beer had a lime in it that tasted metallic/off/not fresh!   Will NOT be returning to Salty Señorita. QC is sadly missing from this scene.

Would you like to feel close to Heaven while still just a couple of miles from King Smoothie? Me, too! That's when I hike Pinnacle Peak! This is, by far, one of my favorite ways to start my day when visiting Scottsdale; I'm always rejuvenated and never let down by this trail. Although there are sections where the steps and overall grade are steep, the trail is well-maintained and not difficult if you allow enough time. It's 1.75 miles one way (not a loop trail) and the whole 3.5 mile glorious trek takes me about 95 minutes with stopping to take pics and sip agua :) Do your lower extremities a favor - hike here soon!

I truly wish I could love this location as much as I love, love, love the one at Desert Ridge. But, I just don't :/  I took my son for lunch, it's enough to break him out of his normal go-to favorites but I thought for sure he'd be a convert.....not so much. The chicken gyro wrap was all bread and under-seasoned chicken. And it took a loooong time to get to the table. I had the garlic mushrooms, hummus with cukes, and dolmades....flavor same as usual, but also a big delay for items I'm pretty sure are pre-made each day. Granted, this visit was during the holiday shopping rush, so maybe the staff was frazzled. But, I feel the location lacks personality overall and could use some pep in the step! Not to be overlooked...HH tapas and house wines are still totally the perfect meal at any of their Phoenix locations :)  ***REVISED REVIEW TO FOLLOW: I returned to PJ Glendale last weekend with my son and we were both much happier with the speed of service, quality of food, plus the atmosphere overall. On this visit, tried the Pinot Grigio alongside the Grilled Veg Salad (I added grilled tofu - great addition!)....it was a tasty combination overall with an abundance of garden favorites. My son ordered the Chipotle Chicken Flatbread Pizza...he enjoyed it and was surprised at how much meat was on it...the only downfall was the level of spice, too much for he & I both, but that's always a personal choice and the name alone told us to expect some heat. His soda was refilled twice as needed and by a server who had a great disposition despite a busy Saturday evening crowd.  Thank you, Pita Jungle, for restoring my love of The Med!

I truly love everything about this company's approach. I know what to expect when I walk in the doors of any location....I've been to 3 of them now and will continue to try more in my travels because it keeps my workouts straighforward when I don't have to take extra time trying to figure out new machines or even locker room set-ups!  This location is beautiful and filled with beautiful people, I'm not even exaggerating a little bit! I love the flow of the cardio area and I loved that on a Sunday there was still plenty of space to do all I needed. The music was a GREAT volume (my home location could learn something from Scottsdale on that point) and the dressing area had wonderful large lockers throughout - yay! I didn't try the salon or cafe on this first visit, but I'll be Yelping any other points I come across!

Great patio service with a smile! And a fresh bowl of cool water for the dog. What a great way to enjoy MLK JR. DAY by way of a leisurely family lunch!  Our party ordered the Grilled Chicken Caesar Wrap, Turkey Cranberry Wrap, & Philly Cheese with sautéed shrooms....with French fries & sweet potato fries....they were all enjoyed thoroughly.  We've decided on a return visit, possibly to enjoy some of the entertainment evening scene which includes dueling pianos, paint night, & karaoke! Check the calendar for this month's schedule!

Tastings some days for happy hours, or midday every Fri, Sat, Sun! I've been lucky enough to run into tastings for whiskeys, tequilas, beers, champagnes, and some great reds. But, hey, now it's Springtime & lighter wines sound about right! Perfecto!

Visited in 2013....this review got lost until now! Yikes & Yelp! I ordered the mushroom pizza on a GF crust. After the bounty of crudités we shared at the table.....3 out of 8 slices was plenty for a light meal! Lunch leftovers = score!  Waiter was very knowledgeable and excited about the menu, which was a nice change from the norm. Great, earthy iced tea but over-priced for something that costs about 26 cents to produce  :P

I think there is a lot of love going on behind that counter! This is the real deal, a great group of people who got together and decided that love should TASTE like BBQ!  We found a BOGO coupon in the PHX Entertainment book and decided to give it a try since we're visiting here and we're already spending way more on dining out than we usually do at home. The line out the door to order was a tell-tale sign of what was to come....yum was to come! There are rarely vegetarian options at a BBQ shack, but I did notice a "pulled squash sandwich" on the menu and that would have been a nice surprise if I was on one of my squeaky-clean-herbivore-days.....HOWEVER, I ordered the half slab that apparently came from a boar, from the size of those bones! But tender, oh so tender, and I added the sauce with a kick which was the perfect flavour for me. The hearty beans were awesome, too, as was the "olive cole slaw". My son wolfed down what he could of the ribs and pulled pork combo....he wasn't overly thrilled with the french fries, but everything else had great character. We each took just less than half home with us = great portions all around.   ** We visited Bryan's on 1/28/11

Bacca Limon Martini (as described on their menu) Bacardi Razz, Il Tramonto Limoncello and fresh muddled raspberries served up and topped with Prosecco. 9.00  Bacca Limon Martini (as described by my taste buds) = unforgettable!  So, yeah, we went for happy hour....and wished we had left more room for a full meal by the menu descriptions of some dinner entrees! However, for happy hour, the portions were plentiful and super tasty. We shared an oversized Brio burger and the margharita flatbread - both yummy, although the flatbread was a bit burnt along the edges. I liked it that way; my girlfriend, not so much....so they happily replaced it with the caprese ravioli. Super yum!  This was a nice introduction to an upscale chain restaurant that I had been wanting to experience....next time, dinner & possibly cannoli :[]

The employees here are proud of their product - for good reason! It's just so super good, every flavor, every time! If gelato has not yet made it's way across your lips, the time is now to make it right. Creamy, fresh ingredients are so indulgent you don't need but a few ounces. My favorite is the sea salt caramel but have also enjoyed choc mint and black cherry cream. As for the sorbet, flavors include pineapple, mango, & strawberry - all refreshing and without the dairy. Treat someone you love today to the G-spot.

I love this product and this concept. For a gal with sensitive skin, the benefit of a brow waxing without the sting or redness is a life saver. Yes, the packages are more pricey than a traditional wax or threading. But the environment is worth the extra few pennies...state of the art equipment, modern styling, & professional staff. I recommend an appointment, but have overheard them accommodating walk-ins on occasion as well. With so many locations across the U.S., prepaid services can be used even when I travel domestically. Bonus.

Why have so many people forgotten the beauty of their local parks? I have mentioned this place to so many people who seem to not even know it exists!   Beautifully landscaped & lots of parking close to the picnic tables.  A good group of small but shady trees - perfect for napping or reading or napping :)   A nice water feature that makes for great bird landings - I saw ducks and geese (or pheasant or flamingos - I'm not really a bird person) splashing about to keep cool on a late summer day in 2012.  Now that we've made it through half the winter, I'm looking ahead to more, ahem, reading in the shade!

Beyond friendly staff & beyond tasty GF options. I've eaten here twice now for lunch and taken to-go bakery items home on several occasions......never a disappointment! My favorite sandwich is the Rachel, which I enjoyed on 7/22/14 and believe is on the menu all the time. My favorite sweet treat is the strawberry champagne cupcake.....this is by far the greatest marriage of indulgence and lightness all at once. Some other favorites have been the frosted brownies and the sliced whole grain bread....best when toasted then topped with coconut oil and avocado :)

I admire a studio that knows its own personality well enough. A studio that employs individuals who promote the same principles. A studio that isn't afraid to try something new with something timeless. Contemporary music in a well-received Yin class is a perfect example of that! I usually don't like a lot of music with yoga, just a personal preference. I especially steer away from music with vocals when teaching my own classes. But, here's the thing about Yin - the poses are held longer and the vocals were not a distraction from getting deeper into the poses. Sounds of Jason Mraz, Enya, and even Cold Play were appreciated by this yogi for sure! I'm happy to add this eclectic style class to my student calendar and possibly teach the same someday soon! **Visit 081112

What fabulous help I received when making such a devastatingly important decision on NEW BOOTS! What is a girl to do when she loves the purple but not the square toe? When she adores the red stitching but wishes for a taller profile? When she thinks Tony Lamas will always have her heart but has had wandering eyes toward the Justins of today?!  Well, the very first thing to do, if in the Scottsdale area, is head to Saba's and ask all the questions you never thought you needed answered about boots. The associates are all very helpful, patient, and proud of their wares....for good reason! The prices are fair, the inventory is bountiful, and there is plenty of space to practice your stride.....after all, these boots are made for walkin'! In case it is of any significance whatsoever, I bought the coral and black Justins with a full-calf height and adorable white stitching throughout - just my size and just my kinda cool!

This is my local go-to for gluten-free breakfast options. Although ordering GF toast or bagel is an up-charge, I feel it's a nice treat sometimes to go along with this wonderful turkey sausage or even a veggie omelette. I've also tried the GF pancakes and I suggest bringing a friend along to share those! Coffee with almond milk completes my meal. Breakfast is served until 2 each afternoon.  For those who like a light bite, the Veg Spring Rolls are a great choice. At lunchtime, there are a few sandwich options, including a turkey burger & a TASTY veggie burger. For those who like a cocktail with their meal, I think the Bloody Mary is spot on. Other crowd faves include mimosas and some great wines by the glass. GOOD LOCAL EATS!

For fast food, this place rocks! It's open 24 hours, has amazingly huge fresh portions, and always has a good-size handful of customers that seem happy with their food :) I love the chicken taco salad, although I wish the shell was corn instead of flour. The beef rolled tacos with guac are tasty and the fresh salsa bar that includes gardineria and fresh cukes is a plus! yummers!

Service is authentically welcoming. Food is authentically fantabulous! Oh, this place has some good vibes! There seemed to be a good amount of "regulars" which is always a good sign, especially with larger-sized familes in this economy. I had the blackened chicken nachos (okay, half an order and wish I had been with someone to share the huge portion). There was tons of chicken, fresh chopped guacamole, plus all the other yummy fixin's one would expect to find. Wash down with a fountain drink, bottled beer, or house margarita and it makes for a tasty treat! I think I'll go back next weekend to try the breakfast menu - ole!

Not even joking.....I could eat those home fries every day....super yummy! On our visit of 4/12/15, I loved the Vegetarian Skillet made with egg whites and feta cheese - absolute heaven! Other items at the table included the Denver Sandwich, the Meat-Lovers Skillet, and the French Toast.....I heard no complaining, just mmmmmm'ing around our table! Get to Nick's Diner II and start the day off right!

This wasn't your average gas pump/convenience store! What a surprise to walk into QT in Tempe and feel like it was a peek into America's future concept! I've been saying for years how I wished we were a nation of tea lovers instead of coffee fanatics...... Well, it's Teatime @ Quick Trip!  Pineapple, Passion Fruit, Tropical, Berry......all in sweetened or unsweetened and all at the fountain in hot or cold. This place takes the cake - and they have that, too....fresh donuts, pastries, hot roller grill items that are obviously rotated well!
