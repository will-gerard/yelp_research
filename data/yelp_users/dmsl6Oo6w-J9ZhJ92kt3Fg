Perhaps I hated Mario's because I am older than 22 or perhaps it is because I felt like a pin ball being shoved between dude after dude.  It also could have been the Philly in me not being able to relax in a bar that has large stained glass windows dedicated to Pittsburgh Sports (I felt like I was behind enemy lines).    Either way, the cheap beer was not enough to woo me into liking Mario's.  The music was too random to be ironic.  I am not good at math, but I do know that the ratio here of dudes to girls = sausage fest.  We had one beer here and it took all my might to not throw some 'bows.

A Saturday night out in Pittsburgh should start at Nakama for no reason other than entertainment (and good cocktails).  The place was packed, but we found a space by the bar in the corner.  We didn't get a chance to eat the food, but I can say the place looks kind of fun.  Not really date worthy as it was pretty loud, but the hibachi style dining is definitely a conversation starter.  I ordered a strawberry citrus-tini, a serious $10 cocktail.  In Philly, I wouldn't think twice about this price, but for the burgh, it seemed a bit steep.  It was quite tasty though and I couldn't really stop myself from licking the flavored sugar on the rim.    Nakama is like the serengeti...it is hunt or be hunted.  Ladies brought their A game, or should I say DD game as most everyone in the place had their breasts on display.  We joked about a possible nipple slip...quite frankly, I wouldn't have been surprised.  The gents are just as preened as the ladies and I couldn't help but see that the Jersey Shore had made it all the way across PA.  Fist pumping anyone?  We only stayed for the one cocktail, but we were there long enough for some decent people watching.  I would suggest going for the beginning of your evening on Carson St.  I know I certainly learned a lot about the singles scene in my short time there.

Thank goodness for Jack's.  As an outsider, I wasn't sure if I would be able to find a bar I felt comfortable in after one night, but Jack's proved to be the spot.  Both beer and shots were super cheap.  There was a flow of people in and out, but even at its most busiest, I didn't feel like I was being pushed around.  The locals were nice enough, or drunk enough.  You have to love a bartender who wears a Jenna Jameson shirt.  The mix of people in the bar was definitely all over the place.  I was in Pittsburgh one night and I met a real steel worker (yes, in the flesh).  Even at the end of the night when the girls room had puke on the floor, I didn't mind.  It almost made sense to me.  If I ever come back to this part of Pittsburgh, I will definitely get my drinks at Jacks.

You can be the most uncultured person in the world, and you still can enjoy the Warhol Museum.  Warhol played to the public and knew how to make art accessible by making the ordinary extraordinary.  This is definitely worth a visit.  I went here 5 or so years ago and different installations always stayed with me.  The room of silver clouds for instance.  You instantly become a small child when you play with this interactive piece.  I just wish you could take pictures in that room.  I also love the Keith Haring Elephant.  Another amazing part (which I don't remember from my first visit) is the multiple tv's set up playing episodes of Andy Warhol's TV show.  You get to see great interviews of Deborah Harry, Keith Haring, Brooke Shields, and the Ramones.  I never even knew these existed but now I am on the hunt for them.  I could have spent the whole day in this section.  I popped into the cafe for a quick cup of coffee and cookie.  They have a small selection of sammies and salads too.  Andy said that in the future everyone will be famous for 15 minutes.  Did he predict youtube?  Perhaps.  Go see his genius and decide for yourself.

Pittsburgh is known for food that can give you cardiac arrest in a matter of seconds and Fat Heads Saloon is the one leading the cholesterol train.  A bar with beer options from all over is my kind of place.  I got Bell's Oberon, one of my favorite beers and with one sample sip, the rest of my crew got the same.  I love to spread my love for Bell's around.  Anyways, we were seated and began to read their extensive menu.  Dear lord there were so many ways to die.  We ordered the nachos to start.  The potato should be the official vegetable of Pittsburgh (and yes, I know potatoes are not really a vegetable).  Since Fat Heads makes their own chips, they build their nachos on potato chips instead of tortilla.  Why are more people not doing this?  These were the best nachos I ever ate.    My lady friend and I decided to split the Southside Slopes sandwich.  The gents ordered the steak sandwich and the Quadruple Bypass burger.  From what I can tell, both were super happy with their choice since they both polished off their meals (and won my heart by doing so).  The Southside Slopes won a place on Maxim's best sandwiches list and I know why.  I have had many a food coma, but I have never been drunk from food and this is what that sandwich did to me.  I literally was buzzing from my half of sandwich, which is a bun with kielbasa, pierogies, grilled onions, and cheese with horseradish sauce.  I am either sad or glad this place is 5 hours away from me.  I can't decide.  I do know if I have to die from a meal, I will pick Fat Heads as my way out.  I am so happy to have ended my trip here.  This is a definite must for any visitor or local alike.

Art is supposed to make you think or make you feel something.  At the Mattress Factory, you will definitely feel something even if you are art illiterate.   The room of dots is neat.  We got to see the fourth floor with the airplane wing in the floor.  You look down it as it cuts through the building and pops out of the side, giving you the view of 4 stories above the ground.  I don't think a piece of art ever terrified and excited me so much.  In the same second, you want to slide down or stand back for fear of falling.  The dark floor is equally inspiring on the 2nd floor.  The room with the blue square is amazing.  We walked in with cynicism and left with a faster heart beat and a belief that art can make you feel.  I am not going to ruin it for you if you have not been.    The ramp to go into the dark and sit and stare at the dull light is also crazy.  We had a foreign gentleman pop in with a flashlight half way through and we had to tell him to leave, though it took a couple of times due to the language barrier.  Perhaps if they had a sign there explaining what to do and that only 2-3 people should be in there at once, it would greatly enhance the experience.  We ran over to the other building and the art there was harder to get on board with.  I could appreciate some of it, but some of it seemed kind of silly.  I am glad there is something like this in Pittsburgh where art is encouraged and is new.  Definitely worth a visit, but its good to keep an open mind.  Like really open.

I didn't need Mad Men to tell me the 60's were cool since I always knew it. It is in my bones.   You know who else knew the 60's were and always will be awesome? The folks at Zuzu, located in the Hotel Valley Ho.  The cool factor in here is off the charts.  You would think that they would just sit back and watch the money come in from hosting locals and out of towners in a neato place, but no.  Their cocktails are equally created with the same amount of care and detail.  The moscow mule was perfect.  I didn't get a chance to sample any food, but the service in the bar was just dandy.  I can't wait to come back.

We only popped in for a little nosh, but my life was changed. The table side guacamole was amazing and elevated to a whole new level.  I loved the addition of the pepitas on top. This weekend, I had to attend a picnic and brought guacamole.  I stole the idea from the mission to add the pepitas and it was a big hit.   We also sampled some of their tacos, the carne asada being the favorite in the group.  The back patio is a great place to spend a meal or two.
