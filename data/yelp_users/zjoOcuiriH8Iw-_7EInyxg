This restaurant is a real gem in North Scottsdale. The Persian room is a breath of fresh air in a city that is dominated by American and Mexican cuisine. I have been to the Persian room twice over the past couple of months and the portions were large and the food was fresh.   For people who are not accustomed to Persian food I would recommend  the koobideh (which is a ground beef dish) or the steak kebab.  For an appetizer I would recommend the humus - it was amazing!  The only downside to the entire restaurant is the rolling chairs. Personally, I have never seen chairs with wheels at a fine dinning establishment, but to me this is a very minor negative.

Since when do falafel's look and feel like hockey pucks? Are fire roasted vegetables supposed to spray water at you? All this and more is what you can expect from the vegetarian plate at daphn's cafe. I just about lost a tooth trying to bite into a falafel and the spanakopita was deep fried with a scent that could only be described as an old freezer smell. Don't get me wrong frozen food can be very tasty, but not when you pay 9.00 for a meal. There is no question that the vegetarian platter has seen better days. If you're taste buds are fried and you have lost your sense of smell this would be a great place to visit. The only positive part of my meal were the fries. Which is the only reason i have given this place two stars. I am praying that my dinner will not cause me to sit on the toilet all day tomorrow.

This has to be one of my all time favorite cleaners. Everything from the cleanliness, service and staff amazed me. I get peace of mind whenleaving my clothing at OrganiCare because I trust that they will handle my belongings as if they were their own.  The downside to having such wonderful service is the price - which is why I have given them 4 stars instead of 5. Be prepared to pay 20-30% more - compared to other cleaners in the desert ridge area. For those who can afford it I would highly recommend them as a top rated cleaners.

I have been waiting for this place to  open ever since I saw the store sign go up. As of today, I have eaten at Sushi Station 4x and had a wonderful experience each time. What i love about this  place is that my wife who hates Sushi;  really enjoyed the spring rolls and teriyaki chicken. Personally, i recommend the snow crab and Philadelphia rolls. In addition, it's a real delight to have Japanese soda and a some cake to finish off my lunch.

Heard about this place a week ago and decided to check it out. My first impression was really good! The restaurant is very clean and the decor is amazing. The staff was very accommodating and knowledgeable of the menu items. My wife and I ordered some sushi roles and the beef ribs. The sushi was amazing, fish was fresh and rice was cooked to perfection. The beef ribs were pretty good, but a little fatty for my taste. I love that there is a classy fresh sushi joint in desert ridge, and I plan on going back to taste other items from their menu
