I used to love their food but everything but the crunchy crab roll tasted weird... I'm not a sriracha or Tabasco lover.. treated like the cook added that to everything. .. even my fingers smell strange from holding the cheeseburger slider... (I sent those back)...eeeek

I have shopped at Trader Joe's since 1980 when they used to have a butcher section! I love the quality of their food and their reasonable prices. I've only recently got into reviewing so that's why this has taken so long to write about. I buy the pre-made salads for my meals when I just want to eat something tasty without preparing. The great thing about TJ's is that they come up with interesting food and snack varieties. My latest favorite is the Allsorts-a-Licorice. If you love black licorice...this one has assorted kinds..some as wheels and some wrapped in what tastes like cake frosting...yum!!

I was telling a friend about this place, and realized I never reviewed it. I couldn't get rwifi eception on my phone when I was dining there. The food was fabulous and the portions great! I had the burger which was so incredibly delicious and mouth watering. I also tried the flatbread with the smoked salmon and that was amazing :-) I went there during happy hours, because I hate to pay retail and love a good deal. lol!  must be the Jew gene!

Omg! My daughter heard about this place and we decided to check it out on one of my trips to Phoenix. We shared the piggy and waffle, and the Cobb salad. It was enough food for the two of us would even know my stomach was portruding, I could have kept eating another round of both! Since then I've been trying to make chicken and pancakes so I could get that combination of syrup and meats! Can't wait to go back and see what they have on the menu next. And by the way, the Cobb salad was really unusual it had chopped smoked salmon pieces. It was fabulous!!

I was waiting for this place to open when I noticed the sign in this new business development. I have been looking for a decent cupcake that isn't made with high fructose sugar and shortening and the organic ones at Whole Foods were too oily for me. Around Halloween, I was craving sugar and went into Gigi's. Personally, I'd rather just eat frosting and skip the cake. As a kid (and adult), I have been known to eat the frosting off cakes and toss the cake into the sink/trash. So...when I saw loads of frosting and beautifully decorated cupcakes - I was excited.  I asked the ingredients (I choose my poisons carefully) and the young girls behing the counter weren't sure but Gigi came out and said they didn't use organic ingredients but they did use sugar and butter. YEAY!  I couldn't decide so I selected six to share with my friend and his kids (an excuse to try 6!).  All of them were my favorite - salted caramel, cheesecake, coconut, red velvet and wedding cake and a chocolate. I was glad his kids only wanted a little so I could eat them over the next few days which I did. Kind of ridiculous that I run 3-5 miles a day and eat a cupcake. I haven't gone back yet but everyday my car wants to go to Gigi's. Maybe it will be this week since it's Thanksgiving and it's a week to pork out!!

I'm really disappointed because this is the second time I've gone to Gigi's and it has been closed more than a half an hour before closing time. Right now it's 833 and the sign on the door says they close at 9 p.m. . The last time I was there the cupcakes and taste as fresh as they usually do so I'm not sure what's going on with this particular franchise. I'm very sad because I drove all the way in from LA with my mouth watering and drooling and expecting to at least get one Gigi's Cupcake during this visit. I guess I'm going to be driving back empty-handed :-(

This place is to die for! Everything I ate was scrumptious! Too many things to list. The owner brought out several things to try in addition to my stromboli was exceptional!! This was orgasmic! Great happy hour! Don't be put off by it looking like some plain place. Not fancy shmancy and the prices are reasonable. Make sure you wear pants with an elastic waist when you eat here...great portions and I'm bringing a friend back tomorrow!!
