My dad was visiting from NY and we were looking for Mexican, so we tried this place. Overall, I like it. The chips were ok, I like thinner chips, the salsa was ok, again I've had better, but it was good. I had the fish tacos...they are made from grilled cod. I asked if I could get the cod deep fried, but that was not an option. The sauce was a tarter based sauce-which seemed very 'American' to me (disappointing), but I have to say, I liked the tacos. Decent flavor on the fish and I liked the rice and beans. (I am not a huge fan of rice and beans, but these were decent and unlike the rest of the table, my beans were not deep friend, but more like pork-n-beans. My son had a grilled cheese-which was good. My father had the pork carnitas, which he enjoyed. Dave had the carnita enchilada, which also looked picture perfect, but I didn't try. The only hiccup with the entire meal was the waiter brought a Chardonnay, instead of a Cabernet  Sauvignon ... and he didn't know the difference between white and red wines, and he should have really known, given they only have a handful of wines. Otherwise, good service.   Overall, I enjoyed dinner and would get the tacos again, they were good and filling!

Workers and sales associates make or break any business..and I was lucky enough to get a great gal to help me a few weeks ago at this Goodwill. I was part of a 'mama gaga' act and I needed to make a Lady Gaga costume. The cable guy was coming to the house and I only had a few minutes to shop for a dress that I could turn into one of Gaga's famous fashion statements. I went to the dress section, which also happened to have an associate hanging up dresses. She asked if I needed help. I told her what I was doing and she took me into the bridal section (which are full brides gowns - great for customs or anyone on budget), she helped me look for a dress in the section she was working and she pointed out one last section where I might be able to find something. Sure enough, I found a dress that I could modify. I couldn't believe how helpful she was; she had worked with a family member doing pageant gowns and gave me some tips to turn my dress into the Gaga fashion statement I was aiming to achieve. I told her she needed a job at a department store, she was so helpful and friendly...and my dress was a hit!

I have searched and searched for a dentist in the North Valley...and I was happy to find these guys a few years ago. They are very thorough, and they don't try to sell you things you don't need. I had a great dentist in Chandler, but after moving up to North Phoenix, it seemed that every dentist I went to want to do extra work and some didn't even want to clean my teeth. I am a 'teeth person' and take my dental work seriously. I wasn't thrilled when they told me I had a cavity last week, but then again they had been 'watching' these teeth for over year, so I know when he said I needed to get it filled, I really do need a filling. While cavities and fillings aren't my idea of a 'great way to start your day;' I don't mind it with these guys.

We stopped in here the other night because my son's saxophone needed repairs. I expected to drop it off, but they were able to fix right then, which was great. Quick, friendly service.

I have been taking my son here for 7 years now. The entire staff is always attentive, they typically have appointments available when you call and your child is sick and their physicals have always been very thorough.  I love they have two sides to the their office - sick door and healthy door. They also have Saturday hours at their other location, so that is useful if you need them.   They do a lot of newborn/new parent education.   The doctors and staff are always friendly, they truly do like what they do and they do a great job.

Best Chinese I've had in a long time! This place was recommended to us by the owner of Hammered Hog, and I don't think I will try another Chinese place in the Valley. The service was excellent, fast, friendly and patient (sometimes I take a long time to decide what I want to eat). The food was outstanding. The Won Ton soup had excellent flavor and lots of Shrimp! I ordered the Happy Family - a favorite of mine from when I lived in NY. This is the first place I have found in the 16 years that I have lived in Phoenix that actually makes it like they do back East. My son ordered the Mongolian beef - another perfectly prepared dish. Dave got the House Special Chicken -great flavor - crispy and juicy. I also love Fried Rice - again, great flavor, huge portion. All the portions were large, the price was reasonable and the service absolutely fantastic! The only downfall - no delivery. :-(   They have been in business for 33 years - and I know why they will continue to be there for another 30!  I suggest you go there now!

I have been bringing my son here for over 6 years.They have video games and toys for the kids. My son goes to both the dentist and orthodontist. I truly can't say anything negative. The staff is wonderful. The office is well run, and I am confident he is getting great care.

Tonight we decided to bring dinner to my family for watching our son. We stopped at the Fry's signature at Shea & Tatum and just couldn't find anything. So we stopped here. I'm familiar with A.J's, but I can't say I'm a regular per say. I was highly disappointed with the prepared food selection-they didn't offer much. We decided on to get the chicken parm made with sun dried tomatoes, a warm pasta salad with cheese and vegetables, a couple slices of pork tenderloin and one slice of pizza...totaling up at $36. Wholly cow!    Overall, food was mediocre.  The good - I liked the pizza and the chicken was very tender and flavorful. The service was great.   The bad-pork was dry with no flavor. Then the price, We paid over $16 for two chicken beasts and no sides - I've had better and more for around the same price , with service!  I think I should have taken the family out to dinner for the quality and the price we paid!

I'm sure many of you are thinking 5 stars, she has lost her mind! However, I have to admit my favorite 'pick me up' food is a Jumbo jack with cheese with curly fries and an oreo shake. i went this past Sunday, and I on this particular day I opted for an iced coffee instead of the shake, and the food was served fast and fresh with friendly service.  Nothing exceptional, but it satisfied me.  So why the 5 stars? This is particular location is in a 'sketchy' area, (19th Ave/Bell) and I have to say the manager was dealing with some very 'ghetto' patrons, they said everthing on their order was wrong; they asked for extra cheese, lettuce and tomatoes and the manager had to put more in the bag. The customers made comments about how they always get it wrong. Let's face it, Fast Food restaurants charge for everything - these folks were clearly giving the manager a hard time and trying to get stuff for free and the manager served them what they needed with a smile. I had to wait while a little bit while she took care of them, but I give this gal a lot of respect for serving me with same smile and professionalism. And when they left, she didn't roll her eyes and say anything negative, she just took care of me.

Ok - first, I wouldn't normally write a review about Walmart; but...I stopped here today on a whim to buy some school supplies as a donation. I was skeptical at first because I am not sure if you noticed, but when they were remodeling this place, the crew switched the M and W (which looked ...well...'Walmartish')...and I believe someone even posted the picture of it here on yelp. Anyways, out of need and convenience, I stopped. Much to my surprise...the inside, and outside were really clean, and the inside was really open. I didn't spend a ton of time in here, but I have to admit I was impressed. I hope the Walmarts that I go to get this refreshed look...as it really did seem to relax me, unlike my typical experiences!   So my advice - which is the same as I wrote in my 'quick tip' - hurry and check it out before it get's trashed like all the other one's in the Valley!

Oh how I bow to the great coca bean...how I crave the sensation of that sweet and delightful taste hitting my lips...whether converted into a milk chocolate chewy delight or a delightful truffle with that unique hard outer shell and gooey smooth filling...Godiva chocolates are some of the best the world has to offer.  I often loose myself in a daydream thinking about all the creations I can taste in this convenient location offering friendly staff, fresh chocolate covered strawberries and a plentiful selection of bars, truffles and desserts that can easily add 5 lbs or more to my waist line within a few short minutes....and they are worth every calorie!

I have been bringing my son here for 6 years. They truly are set-up for kids, they have movies playing all over the office, several video game set-ups, and even a kid-size door. They make going to the dentist fun for children. More importantly, they take excellent care of my son's teeth. I use both the dentist and orthodontist services and I have no intentions of moving him. Also, the office staff is very friendly. I would give this place 6 stars if I could - they are great!

I love the salsa!!!  We ventured down here a few weeks ago for dinner...unfortunately they didn't have fish tacos...but the food was fantastic! When we arrived, we looked over the decor. It was refreshing to eat in a 'free standing' location and not part of a strip mall. As we went to enter, the ladies in front of us stopped because they were doing a birthday celebration for one of the tables - if you want to embarrass the birthday person - Take them here! They do a ceremony where all the employees sing and they create a fire with sugar in a bowl. There was a wait, but it was short. I had the 'Los Dos" Flautas Dinner with one chicken and one shredded beef.  I thought the flautas were great. Dave had the Carnitas, and I did have a little taste and they were good too! I was also very pleased the service, very attentive and helpful. Why only four stars? They overcharged us for a flour tortilla, and once again I wish the rice and beans were better.   Overall - great food with a great experience. The table next to us was eating the ribs and chili - we are definitely going back to try those!

Finally discovered the shake! The gelato spot is one of my favorite places; and I have been to a few locations. Today, on this hot day (115), I finally discovered their shakes, thanks to Dave! I was pretty consistent, taste 4-6 flavored and choose two scoops for $5, but when he ordered a shake, I decided to give it a try and sure enough, I was in pure gelato heaven! I love ice cream and I make one of the best shakes to be had, after all, I worked at an old fashion ice cream parlor for 5 years, but the creamy, yet smooth and light texture and flavor of my peanut butter and banana shake hit the spot! The ability to choose two flavors and mix them is fantastic! No artificial flavoring required and you have the ability to come up with 100's of great shake flavors!  Ut-oh, this might be my new favorite thing to cure my blues from this heat!!

Fish Tacos: 1 Star; Restaurant: 4 Stars  We decided to check out some shops in Cave Creek Sunday afternoon and thought this place looked like a nice spot for lunch. We started with two DOS XX while we waited for a patio seat.   After being sat, they came with the chips and salsa's. I LOVED the chips. I liked the choice of salsa's, but good thing Dave quickly tried the green one because it had avocado (allergy alert!). It would have been nice if they asked if we had been there before and explained the salsa's. The reds were good. We ordered a small portion of fish tacos (grilled) and the Carnita's. The small portion of the fish tacos was one taco, rice and beans, which I thought would be plenty.   When the food came, I was disappointed with the taco. The piece of fish was about 2" long and 1/2" think...skimpy!  it was this small piece of fish in a tortilla, the cabbage was on the side. The only sauce they served with it was a cilantro butter, which I asked for on the side because I am not a huge fan of cilantro. It was ok, I did try some on the taco. I created my wimpy taco and tasted it. It had decent flavor, but I really wasn't getting into it. Of course I ate the whole thing. If you read my other reviews, I like the fish deep fried, and that wasn't an option.   It was served with black beans w/melted cheese and rice. I am not a bean fan, and I am less of a fan of black beans; however, these were good. I did eat some. Now, I really enjoyed the rice - it had flavor!   I also had a Carnita - good flavor, not excellent, but definitely good!     The service was great. I wasn't a fan of the facility layout; however, I did like the decor and the 'private booths' along the pond. They have a nice 'family story' that I would love to re-write as a marketing person and I would like to try some other dishes on the menu, so we will probably be venturing back another time. Plus - I did love those chips!

We stopped here the other night after the movies for a quick bite. We sat at the bar, expecting faster service. I am pretty sure the bar tender has worked there for several years; but I don't know how she has managed to keep her job because her service was absolutely horrible. At first she ignored us and waited on what I would assume was a regular. Luckily we were finally acknowledged, and she was about as friendly as a post. I ordered a beer and Dave a glass a wine. She had no wine knowledge, which was very apparent.   On top of the crappy service came the same mediocre food we have come to expect from chain restaurants - if it isn't deep fried and smothered in sauce - then it comes from a bag and has no flavor. We had chicken wings, of course there was hardley any meat on the wings and we asked for Blue Cheese. We got one ranch and one blue cheese.  I am not sure what she didn't understand about the statement, "I am from NY, I want blue cheese, not ranch."  But then again...  Will I come back - probably not. I can go to other chain restaurants for the same mediocre food with way better service.

Today I was in a jam, my dad arrives at 8:30pm and I pulled out the super high, super cool air mattress last night only to find out that my 11 year old failed to tell me he managed to break it (last summer) and there is a large hump and it won't keep air. I bought this through Cabelas last year (of course for Dad), so I called customer service to see how long it was under warranty, which turned out to be only 90 days. Therefore, I had to buy a new one, but there was no way I could get to the store in Glendale to pick it up today, but if I ordered/paid for it, I could have family members that could get it and bring it to me...making my life a lot easier! The 800 Customer service told me I had to call the store direct, so I did. I can't give you the details because they bent a few rules, but I have to say they were very accommodating and friendly,..and they completely helped me out of a jam! Plus the store price was $10 less...and I was able to purchase an extended warranty that covers any damage for another year (cha, ching!). Thanks for the awesome customer service 2 days before Christmas!

Finally, after months of wanting to try this place we stopped today for breakfast and I must say it was fantastic. They have a big menu, so I had a hard time choosing. While I really wanted to try the French toast or waffles, I also didn't want all the sugar and carbs ...so I opted for the veggie omlet, which came with harsh browns and a side of pancakes. I upgraded to blueberry pancakes. I felt the portions were huge, but appropriate for the price. Mine was excellent! Dave had the apple cinnamon baked pancake...which I had to try...and it was really good. Also, our service was excellent...I was in desperate need of coffee and she kept my cup filled. I will definitely be back to try some other specialty items.

I am not a fan of this branch. While I feel sorry for the workers because there is ALWAYS a line, they truly do not treat all customers equally. They tend to cater towards the Mexican clientele. It is nice that most of the workers are bilingual, but they shouldn't be unfriendly to the other clientele.

Disappointment! I have been a huge fan and loyal patron of Pei Wei since they came to the valley. We don't go as much as we used to, but a few weeks ago we ordered take-out. I asked if they would include both a mild and a hot sauce for the lettuce wraps and I customized a kids meal. When Dave brought our food home the first thing we noticed was 2 fortune cookies for three meals. Ok, maybe I shouldn't complain...but come on! Then the kids meal had barely any meat, another disappointment. First, I dove into the lettuce wraps, which they only provided one sauce - not the two they said they would provide. However; the worst part was my meal, I had the Mongolian beef...a dish I usually crave from them, but my meal was so salty I couldn't even eat it! It was absolutely horrible! Again, very little meat in the dish. Sorry, but I think you lost a customer over this meal!

While I am delayed in writing the review, I have to say the experience will last a lifetime. My family and I did this on a groupon promotion last year...we actually went for the ride in late December. It was myself, my son (10), my aunt (50 something) and my grandmother (83) while my mother followed us in the car (not a chance she was going to try this one!). We had a fabulous time, the employees were careful with both my son and my grandmother. While we were all having the time of our life, others in the basket were a little nervous; however, the captain was very talkative and he explained everything and kept those people at ease.   The ride was long and the height varied. At the end, we were served a 'picnic' breakfast with mimosas. The breakfast wasn't anything to write home about, but it was a nice touch. You had to pay extra for the mimosas glass, which I did.   The only thing I didn't like, no facilities...luckily I am a camper and didn't mind going in the wild. (I might advise you not to drink a full pot of coffee prior to the ride, but that is totally up to you).   Even if you are a little nervous, I would highly recommend you try this out.

We stopped here a few weeks ago for a happy hour drink. I had been here once before several years ago, and it was nice then. First, our service was fabulous, everyone was very friendly. I liked the ambience. While we didn't eat, the menu looked very appetizing, and next time I will plan on trying some things. The wine selection was good; could have been a bit more for a wine bar, but definitely ample. They don't really have 'happy hour prices.' so our stop wasn't exactly cheap; but our wine was worth the money.   What I really liked - they support a lot of charities. They had 2-3 charity events occurring over the next month. The local support really impressed me.  I look forward to visiting more often and supporting this local business and some of their charity events.

My son has been coming here for allergy shots for over a year now. My son is now 11 and they always make sure he is comfortable, which is important to me. The doctor was very thorough on his original exam and most recently for his yearly check-up. The staff is really friendly, the billing is always accurate and never a hassle, I even changed insurance companies, and it was a simple change that took hardly any time!   As for the treatment itself, my son is so comfortable with this place I drop him off and wait in the car. It saves us time and I can't tell you how much better  he feels now that he is actually receiving treatment for his allergies!   I highly recommend these guys!

I'm stuck-I really don't know what to rate these guys! We ordered take-out. I called in the order, and the guy that answered was very friendly and professional. I heard the other line ringing and I asked if he needed to answer it, and he said no, I was his only customer; which I thought was great. He said the pizzas would be ready in 15 minutes and confirmed the specifics of the order. Dave went and got the pizzas, and they were ready when they were supposed to be. So good service!  I haven't had Pizza Hut in a long time; but I expected the quality to be consistent with my past experience. I grew up on Pizza Hut, we used to drive to the next town (7 miles) over for this treat (yes, I'm from a rural place)...and no matter how long the time passes, it's always that same greasy crust I know I shouldn't be eating, but yet I love to eat it. Anyways, the veggies and topping were good quality, my only complaint is that the crust was too doughy; neither the pan pizza or the hand tossed were cooked long enough; which did lead to my disappointment.  So why don't I know how to rate them? I love pizza and eat it all the time. If I was going to rate them on taste alone: 2.5 (doughy crust); service: 5; uniqueness: 2; however consistency, turn-around time and service in this location was good tonight! So they earn 4 stars; hopefully they will adjust the cooking times in he future! It's not gourmet, and I've definitely have had better, but it's decent.

My mom took me here for lunch a couple of weeks ago. I like how their menu is set-up for lunch. You can choose pizza or pasta, then a salad and your drink for a standard price. There are upgrade items available. I stuck with the basics at the bill was 10.95 plus tax and tip.   For my entree I choose the curry chicken, mixed green salad and green tea. The food was excellent. I choose the balsamic dressing, which was way too thick for my taste, but it had good flavor. I also enjoyed the tea.   My only complaint is the service was friendly, but slow. It seemed to take forever to take our order and to get our food.

I went here with my mother a couple of weeks ago off from a 'Groupon Now' offer. We shared the chicken picatta. The portion was large and the dish was flavorful. We each added on a side salad - it  was a typical salad for a restaurant, mixed greens with one slice of tomato; per usual, disappointing. However, I got the greek dressing and really liked it.  I felt the price was reasonable, but enjoyed it more with the groupon offer. They had a long list of specials that looked good and there were several menu items I would like try. I will check them out again sometime.

Stopped in here for lunch after someone recommended it. Great local spot. we shared two sandwiches - the roast beef and blue cheese and the asparagus and harveti with ham. Both had great flavor. The menu is small, but they do everything themselves, so I don't mind a small menu.   We also got cupcakes; however, I wasn't that impressed.   Overall, the service and set-up was good; the sandwiches were good and the deserts were just ok.

Who doesn't love fanscinations??? I have been in this location several times because it is close to the house. While the selection is a bit less than the larger stores, and I always make sure the car if locked before entering the store; but I must say, I have always been pleased with the service and associates. They are always very helpful and friendly.

Cheap drinks, friendly service and absolutely fantastic people watching! This place has two sides, one has a live band; the other has pool and sometimes a DJ. They have different drinks/beers on each side. I've sat on both sides, and you'll see everything from a suite jacket to hardcore biker attire on the men...and t-shirts & jeans to those skimpy little skirts on skinny and not so skinny bodies for the ladies. Overall, a really good dive bar, good pizza, and a great place to hang-out.

I have been a member here for 15 years. I have always been disappointed with the locations, they are just not convenient for me.However, I have always been a happy cusotmer. A few weeks ago I had to make a deposit and cash a check. I went to this location and I had never had a bad experience before. I went through the drive-thru and it was about 5-10 minutes before they closed. I placed the checks in the tube with my license. The women seemed annoyed because one check needed an additional signature. I did as she asked and passed it back to her. Then she said she needed a signature for the cash and she sent everything back through the tube. I asked if there was anything else and she said no, so I drove off and went about my business. Later that evening I discovered the women had kept my license. Given we were going out for New Years, I probably needed that! So the next morning we went down to the branch, we were about 20 minutes before they opened. I noticed workers in the windows and went to the door and docked. There were 4 employees, they all ingnored me. I did finally get one person's attention and when I did I jestured and yelled through the doors that I needed to get my license.  He seemed to acknowledge me; but I didn't get a response. So I went back to the car and I got a piece of paper to write the employees a note. When I returned to the door and held it up, the man that looked at me with a blank stare had my license and made a 'one minute' hand gesture. He came over and slipped it through the crack of the door, he wouldn't even open the door or speak to me.   I was highly annoyed, someone could have come to the door and acknowledged me and said they would get the license, but instead they were very rude. I made a trip way out of my way to get something that wasn't returned to me, and an honest mistake I am sure; but at the same time, I am very disappointed in the employees behavior.

Finally made it here!  I've had this place book marked for several months when another yelper saw my  reviews for fish tacos and sent me a note to try this place out. What a great find. We started off with chips and salsa. They asked if we wanted the habanero sauce, and we tried it - let me tell you HOT!  I tried the fish taco and the calamari taco. The fish was deep fried, which I like, a good portion. It didn't have too much cabbage and was it topped with tarter sauce, again a nice portion. The calamari taco also had fried calamari, topped with a little bit of cabbage and a chipotle sauce. Both were very good. I have to say I would have preferred another sauce over the tarter sauce, so next time I will order the fish with the chipotle sauce. They also offer a blackened fish (grilled) and shrimp tacos (grilled), which I want to try as well. of course, I don't go anywhere without trying Dave's, so I took a bite of his beef burrito, and it was good. It needed a little of the Cholula Chipotle Flavored hot sauce, but otherwise, good flavor. of course we washed all this down with a couple of DOS EQUIS XX.  We had the opportunity to speak to one of the owners because it was late on a Monday night. He is an extremely nice guy. They just opened another location on Scottsdale and Shea, and both are family run. They take a great deal of pride in their food and service, and you can tell.

Last minute we decided to go camping; however, I needed to do a little computer work...which meant I needed power. Radio Shack is always my 'go to place' for these types of needs and I swung into this one because it was close to the dog sitters. The manager could obviously see I was in a hurry, so I told him I needed a car charger for the laptop Within 2 minutes he found the charger, rung me up and out the door I went! And while he had no control over it, it was on sale! I love it when the staff knows the product and can read the situation!

We had breakfast here a few weeks ago and I thoroughly enjoyed it. At first I didn't care for the ordering process; however after experiencing the service and meal, I was very pleased. I liked the decor and ambiance. We sat on the patio-which really sets this place above other restaurants, however that type of space/set-up is hard to come by in Phoenix. Being dog-friendly was another plus. There were several things I wanted to try, But I opted for the Gouda and bacon Brizza and Dave had the Santa Fe Eggs Benedict. Of course I had coffee - and it was delicious! The Brizza was very big, I ate just 1/2 (at it stuck with me all day). I felt the cheese/bacon proportions were perfect and flavorful. I sampled the eggs benedict - also delicious! I felt the prices were good and the menu selection was well balanced. Obviously I am not a vegetarian; however I respect their large vegetarian menu and their practice of separating the cooking areas and dishes - definitely not an easy task on their part - so that is very cool. I can't wait to try some other dishes!

Another thank you goes out to my yelp friends for finding and writing about this great gem of a business! Unfortunately I am very hard on my shoes and I had three pairs of boots that needed new heals. Sure enough, Boris hooked me up for just $12-15 per pair. He told me they would be ready in a week, but called two days early. The boots came out fantastic!  If I need more repairs, I will be coming here!

I now call this gym 'home.' I am very fusy about my gyms, and the staff here is very friendly, other patrons seem friendly and they have a wide selection of equipment that isn't overwhelming.   The Good: -Selection of equipment (both cardio and weights) -Pool -Several Showers -Spa in the respective locker rooms (not co-ed) -Several Group classes and various times throughout the week -Several trainers (if you want one) -Basketball court -Reasonable price -Several areas for stretching and mat work  The Bad: -Pool heater has gone out a few times and it takes a couple of days to get it fixed -Sorry, but the old people (retirees) invade the gym in the morning hours, they tend to take longer on the machines -Training sessions are expensive  Overall, I think it is hard to find the perfect gym, but you should select one that has a variety of equipment that allows you to have the flexibility to change your routine; but more importantly, you need a place where you feel comfortable. No matter how stupid I look trying something new, I have never felt uncomfortable or like other people were criticizing me...which is why I now call this gym 'home.'

This review is for the records department. I needed to update a record from a very old court case. This review is very long overdue; and I wish I could remember the gal's name in the record's department that helped me, because she was so friendly. She took my information and they needed to call me when the records arrived at their office. Sure enough, 2 days later, I received the phone call. I explained I couldn't get to the office for another week, and she said that was fine. When I did get to the office, she had everything ready and even worked to save me money by only giving me exactly what I needed. To be honest, I didn't expect good service for my request. It was old and really what do they care? However, I have nothing but positive things to say because they did care and they took the time and energy to provide a great experience.

Today I had the opportunity to taste Barro's pizza at a training I attended. I am giving them 4 stars because:  1) They were on time and food was hot 2) The pizza's all looked consistent 3) The ingredients were fresh 4) good flavor 5) Filling!   The crust was too thick for me, I like a thin crust. I also liked the flavor of the white pizza; however I wish they would spread around the ricotta instead of placing a great big bob in the middle of the pie.  I found the pizza good; although I would probably choose another place if given the opportunity, primarily because of my personal preference for the crust.

I have been at this MVD several times, and for the DMV, I have found it a pleasant experience almost every time. They aren't too slow and the people seem to be very friendly. However, today I was disappointed with the information desk. The lady working it was friendly, but highly inefficient. First, she created a line because she was talking to a man who had walked out of the DMV with his name spelled incorrectly on his license at a prior visit - (Note, they tell you to review it for a reason) - and they were arguing if he would have to pay the $12 again - she is working the information desk and has NO CONTROL over the fees and they both should let go of the conversation well before I walked to the counter. But they kept rambling on, both arguing about it, creating a line. Finally they gave up after several minutes and we all starting making noises. Then, I filled out my paperwork and somehow my number was skipped. Hmmm...interesting! So - the information lady cost MVD a star.    However, when I finally got called...it was desk number three. I did not get her name, but she was awesome! Not only was my license taken care of in quickly, she had no problem looking up my registration without any paperwork. She was so easy and pleasant! I have found the same with gentlemen at window number 1 in a previous visit. Plus, the lady that took my picture didn't like the first one - so she took it again - who does that? THEY DO and I loved it!   I wouldn't say 'Yay, I'm a fan per say' because I do avoid the MVD as much as possible, but because of the service, I will only visit this MVD location!

I was searching for a place off to meet my friend for a pedicure - and with the help of Yelp, we found this place which was almost perfectly located about 1/2 way between our houses.   The hours listed on Yelp are wrong, they are open on the weekends (Sundays 10:30-5). So today we met at 11:30 for a pedicure. The place was very busy, and like others, I drove by the first time. However, I have to say the pedicure was great...and very inexpensive - $22 for the pedicure with my big toe designs. I was also very impressed with the selection of designs, and the 'bling' offered with those designs. While I love my usual place, I ask them to do a design and they typically do a free hand flower. They had simple and elaborate designs all displayed in case, it was difficult to choose! Since we are heading to Rocky Point this weekend for a little beach and R&R time...I opted for an all 'bling' Martini glass design.   One person did the pedicure, while a different person did the design; so I  felt obligated to give a bit extra in the tip, but overall it is was a good pedi and good experience. My girlfriend and I sat and chatted and we had a relaxing experience, and it was still a few dollars cheaper than my regular place.   The reason for the 4 star - I would have liked a bit longer of a leg message. I know this was an awesome value and I shouldn't complain.

I am giving this place 4 stars because it is unique. The night we went it was crowded...but we went because of all the hype on Yelp and my quest for Fish Tacos. The service was good. I tried all the salsa's and only liked a few. And as for the tacos...they were ok. The Shark Taco needed a better sauce and I would have enjoyed it much better. Truthfully, I didn't find the shark tacos as great as everyone else does on these reviews, but then again, I am new to Fish Tacos. I also tried the Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco, I found this flavor strong (unlike other Mexican places I have tried), so that is good, but I didn't really care for it.  The bad, my son ordered the steak Quesa. He didn't care for it at all, I did like this, but then the waitress took the entire thing away when we weren't done with it and Dave didn't even get a chance to try it. So that was a bit disappointing, given he didn't eat hardly any of it.   Overall...I am glad we went.

This place was ridiculously slow tonight. I stopped for my yearly crave - the Shamrock Shake. To be honest, I have no idea why I love these, especially since I like REAL ice cream and shakes the old fashion way - but this minty green shakes have me hooked. My son also wanted one, but he wasn't quite sure he would like it so I asked if he could have a small taste of mine before they made his; however, they could not do that. Instead I had to buy my shake, move to the side while the order was rung through the POS and then filled and brought out to me. Once he decided if he liked it or wanted another flavor, we had to place another order and then pay for it.  I asked if I could just pay for a small shake and he would decide the flavor after he tasted my - NOPE. I was highly annoyed. I understand restaurant POS and the need to track inventory, but come on - it's a shake. Not only that ... it took over 10 minutes for 2 shakes and they weren't that busy.   Unfortunately, I have been to this location on several times because it is close to the house. I typically don't eat the food, but my son loves McDonalds, so I stop for him. On numerous occasions they have messed up the order (he only eats plain burgers) and the service speed is extremely random, regardless of how busy they are. Sometimes it is awesome, other times it is horribly slow.   I really don't like giving businesses a poor rating, but this last visit topped it off, and I had to share. I understand the machines are automated, but they could have rang up the shakes and then manually poored the correct flavor, it isn't rocket science, and it isn't going to through off their inventory!

I have been meaning to write a review for this place for over 6 months, so I apologize for the delay. I have been in the store a few times and every time I ask the associate for help, they are extremely helpful and knowledgeable. This one particular time, the associate helped my find attire that mimic Janis Joplin for a party I was going to and she spent about 30 minutes with me right before closing time. Another time I had to do a return and it couldn't have been easier. It is Stein Mart so the selection will be hit or miss, but I have always found consistent and excellent customer service.

Great service, great food. We stopped here late on a wednesday night. We were concerned they were going to close, but the hostess welcomed us and said no, we are still open until 9:30 (it was 9).   I was hanging on Dave's coat tails on tthis one; 1st, I am a newbie to sushi and just now discovering what I like and don't like. He ordered us a couple of pieces of sushi, which I thought were good. However, then he ordered us Pad Thai with tofu. TOFU...are you kidding me? I am not a fan; but I decided that I would try it, and it was so good! I could not believe the flavor of the noodles and the TOFU...I loved it! Given that it was my first time trying Pad Thai, I might not be the expert, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The service was great, they were patient and not pushy at all, even though we didn't leave until a few minutes after closing. They even gave us a sample of their green tea. It was sweet, but that was right up my ally, and I enjoyed that as well.   I am sure we will be giving this place another try!

We spent New Years Eve here.The place was packed! However, the staff was very friendly and they were doing everything they could to service the crowd fast.  We shared a room with another couple. The room exceeded my expectations! The decor, linens and layout was superb. I do think it is a bit pricey for a hotel where you are spending your money gambling; however, the four of us definately will be going back!

I had the opportunity to taste these great dogs at the a street fair a couple of weeks ago. It was definately tasty! I opted to go with the Moki and a regular dog for the first time. It had a nice crisp skin and it truly was a great tasting dog. They have a ton of toppings to choose from, and I liked the combination of the Moki. I also liked the fact they have several options to choose from for their dogs. And they had a great selection of 'old school' soda.   A+ for service! While there was a huge line and they were definately working very hard and on a sunny spring day - the service was extremely friendly. I was not a fan of the pita bread, it was very good bread, I just would prefer my dog on a roll. I also thought the price was reasonable - $5 for the dog. (I didn't get a drink, I didn't see the selection of soda until after I had paid and I didn't want to hold the other people up, there was a huge line that day).   A+ for presention. It's not just a dog slapped in a pita - it's neatly placed and rolled in the pita with a toothpick and pickel (check out my pictures).  I am looking forward to trying their other selection of dogs!  Good Stuff!

Yup...I ate the whole damn pizza because it was that GOOD!! I'm miserably fully, but super satisfied!! I ordered before reading the reviews, otherwise I might have chosen something other than the Funghi, only because every reviewer LOVES it; but then again maybe not. I was the lone trooper tonight and decided to go out and dine by myself. I had been here before, and remembered it was good, but that was probably a year ago. I asked for a little balsamic to go on the pizza and they gave me this awesome balsamic reduction, it was perfect.   Good service, great wine and pizza recommendations, nice atmosphere. I will definitely be going back more often!

At first, we were the only ones in the place...but several other tables followed us in. This was my first time in this new place and I had no idea what to expect. I liked the atmosphere and décor, simple. Personally I felt the TVs detracted from the décor, but I admit they entertained my son because they were playing sports. The inside is small. It was difficult to have a private conversation, and unfortunately an obnoxious patron came in just after our arrival and sat on the other side of the restaurant...but that is another story for another day.   We had the chicken parmesean rollatini, a sun-dried tomato ravioli special and a custom Hawaiian style rustica pizza. I had never had a 'rollatini,' it was similar to a Stromboli. It was good, a little too much bread for me, but that is because I like thin crust. The portion size was large, I only ate  1/2.  The Rustica pizza was very good, nice crispy crust, I like the sauce and the toppings covered the complete pizza. My son loved it.  Again, we took left-overs home. The Sun-dried tomato ravioli had a mix of alfredo and red sauce, which is one of my favorite combinations. I did not find the alfredo sauce too heavy and overall it was a nice dish, again a nice portion.  For dessert, we had a homemade brownie and cookie with ice cream--that was delicious as well.   We also had a bottle of wine, which as compared to other pizza/Italian places in the area, I found reasonably priced. Most of their bottles ranged from $27-40; where I have been in some places and you can't find a bottle under $32.00.   Our service was great. I felt bad for the servers working because they also didn't know how to handle the obnoxious women disrupting the entire restaurant with her trailer trash conversation while completely either ignoring or yelling at her child - it was a tough situation for them - but we never felt ignored and they loaded our son up on Sprite.  I would say the only problem with the open seating is the size and all the tile and wood creates an echo instaed of absorbing the conversation. You could literately hear everyone else's conversation without trying that hard.   Overall, good quality food at a reasonable price. I will continue to recommend this place.

For most, getting a tattoo is part of telling your life story, and that was true for me. For years I desired the perfect tattoo, but could never decide on the design and I was never convinced that I would cherish it, well forever, until recently. First, I decided the symbol - a dragon. After several searches, I thought I had found a simple design, with a few modifications and personalization that would finally tell part of my story. The next challenge was finding an artist. A close friend had met an artist -Lucky.  My friend told me months ago that Lucky was an artist and he had seen some of his work. From his own personal experience, he said you want to go to the artist because the quality, interpretation and artistic rendering are, well just better, otherwise, you take a risk unless you are getting something very common. Obviously, I trust my friend's judgment and his own experience regarding this subject, and on a whim last week took my picture over to Ritual Addictions and to see Lucky. Lucky looked at the piece, looked at me and said, 'how much do you really like this?' I said 'I like it, but I want some modifications.' He said, 'well, why don't you leave this hear for a few days and I will expand the wings, and draw you a design, similar but unique. If you don't like, we can do this one.' I thought - wow - that would be great, I liked where he was going with the design and I was really excited. So I returned a week later and he had sketched out the design, which was good, really good, and exactly what we talked about. We briefly talked about colors choices and from there he went to work. The interpretation was fantastic, the color choices were perfect and I absolutely LOVE it. Besides the design, he explained what to expect, all the instructions for care, you know, the things a 'novice' would need to know.  When we were talking, he said he prefers to draw the design so that it fits the client. Some people are impatient and go to another studio...and frankly, he ends up fixing some of those...but others end up coming back for more. I can see why.  Lucky completely guaranteed the work and will look at it in a couple of weeks to see how the colors are holding up and any touch-up required.  The studio is clean and inviting - all the people are friendly - and I looked through the other work, which also had some fantastic, custom pieces.   Some say that your first tattoo experience will determine if it will be the only tattoo, or one of many - I will say this will not be the only one he will do for me!

We stopped here last Friday-the jalapeño poppers are awesome--homemade and wrapped with bacon. Also tried the slidders-excellent! Good portions, friendly service! They have live music during the week, I will be back soon to try more! Everything is fresh and homemade-definitely a gem!

I really want to like this place, the service was fantastic, I liked the decor, but the food was just 'Meh'...in my opinion, where my hubby thought it was outstanding, so I will go with 4 stars and tell you my tale.    We were at fashion square doing some Christmas shopping and needed dinner, and we desired a 'gourmet' burger, when we did a yelp search this place came up. With the 4.5 Star rating we decided to try it, before reading the reviews. We called and were able to get a 9 pm reservation, which allowed me to do some more shopping. Perfect!   We arrived and were immediately seated. However, we kept getting the wind from the entrance. We asked our server if we could move, and he was more than accommodating, and we had a new table in just a couple of minutes, even though the place was very busy. The new server was just as great. You can tell, they focus on providing an awesome dining experience through service. I LOVED THIS!  This is what I didn't like - the place was so loud, that we couldn't have a conversation. In fact, I got a headache before our food even came out. There are two factors at play - the bar is in the middle of the restaurant, and when people drink they get loud. Also, they have high, open ceilings, without anything to 'absorb' the sound, so the loud laughing and all conversations, bounced off the walls. This esculates as the place fills up and when it is full, like it was last night, everyone is talking and laughing louder than normal, to the point where I heard people almost screaming. All this is bouncing off the walls, giving me one large headache. So there we sat, in silence, texting each other and facebooking because it really was too difficult to have a conversation.    After looking at the menu, and asking the server if they have hamburger, we found out they only had lamb burgers. While the reviews are good, they really aren't our thing. So much for Gourmet Burgers. We felt the menu was limiting, and our eyes were more focused on the desserts than anything else. The appetizers also looked better than the entrees, it seemed that there wasn't that much I liked, or if I did I felt it was overpriced. However, we were hungry and you yelpers love this place, so we decided to try a couple of entrees. We ordered the Chicken and Waffles appetizer (for the kid), while we split the scallops and the buttermilk chicken entrees.   We also ordered bread, which brought my attention to the fact that there were no salt and pepper shakers on the tables. I happen to like a little salt and pepper in my olive oil for the bread; which tells us, as foodies, the chef thinks that everything is prepared to the perfect seasoning and you don't need salt and pepper shakers. I will tend to disagree. I probably should have asked for them, I am sure they would have brought some, but I didn't.    Our food came. I got 3 scallops for $24. They were fantastic; however, 3 scallops and some greens, no matter how good, is not worth $24, maybe $14. Thank goodness we split the entrees! I thought the buttermilk chicken was good, but not outstanding and liked the corn, it had a bit of a kick. However, I will say I do not like brussel sprouts, and I liked these (A+ for those). I sampled the kid's chicken fingers and I LOVED it! You can tell it was prepared in-house. The kid didn't care for the chicken fingers all that much but he loved the waffle, it was gone in about 30 seconds. And I felt the $10 price was spot on. The hubby actually didn't care for chicken fingers, but really liked the buttermilk chicken and he also loved the scallops.    Because all the desserts looked amazing we had to try them. Again, I was a bit disappointed; they all had great flavor; but nothing I would crave again. The pudding jar was such a unique dessert, but I felt like I was eating peanut butter out of the jar, and I was hoping for something a bit lighter...a pudding consistency. The apple pie was good, but it was all crust, it needed more filling. The gingerbread pudding - very good! (I was not disappointed, even the ice cream was awesome).  So, has you can see, I am torn in the review because there were some things that were truly outstanding, where others fell short. I liked the concept, I like what they are trying to do with the menu, I like the décor and I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED the service. I wish there were a few more entrée selections. I would not rush to go back here, but I do want to go back. Also, I wouldn't recommend bringing your children, especially if they are picky like mine is!

We have been here s couple of times, once for wine, once for dinner. I got a calzone for dinner. It is huge. It was good I would order it again. (However, you need to ask for sauce).  The other night a friend brought over a pizza...fresh mozzarella and pepperoni. By the time he got to our house it was cold, but it was still really good.   I think their wine is a bit over priced...and while they offer 1/2 price bottles on Wednesdays, you can still find the same bottles/years at other restaurants for far less than their regular price.    Overall, I like the atmosphere and I will be back to try more dishes.

I finally had a chance to go here a couple of weeks ago. Overall, I liked the place. The person at the counter was very friendly. They weren't overly busy, but almost every seat was taken. It really did seem like a street taco joint you would find in Mexico, basic seating, little decor, some selection of drinks.   Next Positive - CHEAP - $2.00 for an authentic fish taco. Awesome. I ordered two, grabbed a drink and waited for only a few short minutes for my order. First off, I noticed they did a marinated cabbage mixture on the taco, instead of just raw cabbage. I really liked this, they stepped out of the norm. Unfortunately, I didn't particularly care for the flavor of the cabbage, (but that was because of my tastes, not because of their efforts), but with the fish it gave the entire thing a nice flavor. And I had no problem eating them both us in about 2 minutes. Good Stuff!   They also give you caramelized  onions with your. I love caramelized onions and ate them all. This was an extra touch I hadn't seen. I am sure my breath wasn't all that fantastic, luckily I wasn't going back to an office meeting, but boy were they good!    My only negative - I was still hungry - and this was probably my fault, I walked in starving. So I ordered a shrimp taco. The shrimp was marinated in a lime juice mixture, again a touch I liked, I just didn't care for it all that much. It was good, it just isn't my thing.   They are on the main street, but if you blink you would drive right by, so you will need to look for the place. Good food, great service. I will be visiting them again soon!

I would actually say about 3.5 ... But since they did a fundraiser for my son's school, I bumped them up.   The good: selection! I had a cod sandwich, big and juicy, could have done without the cheese and it needed more tarter. It was a large, full piece if fish. The onion rings - large, I would consider the breading 'medium' thickness. I love onion rings, and these are better than any other fast food joint.  The negatives: my son got the bacon burger, thin and dry. French fries sucked.   Now this place is suppose to have good ice cream - and if you know me - you know I eat ice cream almost daily. I have say - average. In fact, I think I would prefer DQ, especially for the price.  Finally - this place is expensive for fast food. Bacon burger, fries, softdrink, cod sandwich and onion rings - $14.00...I think I can find healthier options for about the same price and speed.

I have been to Oregano's on several occasions when my son was a bit younger. He loved making his own pizza, but I never really found anything all that spectacular about the food. However, tonight we decided to give it a try because Dave wanted a deep dish. We arrive a little after 9 and by the time we were seated and had a chance to look at the menu, it was 9:30.  We ordered a deep dish and a salad. The server promptly told us that they took over an hour to make(They closed at 10) . You would think that might be listed on the menu, but it wasn't. He was nice about it and we decided to see if there was something else we wanted; however, I knew Dave really wanted the deep dish so I told him to get it, they said it was fine. (We like to respect the closing times of businesses, if you close at 10, then you want your customers gone and to move on with your day, you don't want to be hanging around). We decided it would be ok and we ordered the deep dish,. This time the server informed us it was 80% cheese, and if we wanted more meat than cheese to go with the Pan Style over the Deep Dish, and by the way, the Pan style also takes an hour to make. We decided we did want the pan and we ordered. I also got the House Special salad.  The salad was good, the pizza was really good and while it might not come through in the text here, the service was really good. We really like it when the servers tell us what is good and what is just ok, that is part of our dining experience.  We could tell this guy was being honest and really wanted us to enjoy our experience here. This alone moved this review to 4 stars.   Now here is the bad: Almost every location is on a wait during dinner, almost every day of the week; if a pizza takes an hour to make...don't you think you should list that on the menu? These guys have always impressed me with their witty marketing, so I was really mad I had to wait an hour for my pie! Secondly, the waiter also told me people will typically call ahead and place their Pan or Deep Dish order and then come in about 30 minutes later and tell the hostess they placed their order and decided to eat it there, skipping the wait and the line. Now your promoting Bad Consumer behavior and these same people get to cut in line because they called in? How is that fair to the people that are sitting there for an hour or so waiting for a table?   I would only give these guys 2 stars for all the dishes I have had and didn't care for, I never found them all that flavorful or original; however, the Pan pizza was good and the service excellent for customers that closed the restaurant, so they get bumped this time around. Unfortunately, I doubt we will go back anytime soon because it will take an hour for our pizza and we won't be one of those BAD customers that decides to call ahead and skip the wait.

We went here on a restaurant.com coupon. First-don't buy that coupon (another story for another day). The service is very friendly and prompt. However, the food is, well, bland is a compliment. We have gone for both breakfast and dinner. The portions are huge; but there is no flavor. It's pre-processed substance at its best. You can tell everything comes from a can or pre-made for the masses, basic salt and pepper help add flavor to this stuff. And if you don't go on a restaurant.com coupon, it is very cheap. So you want to fill up for a very cheap price, (go drunk and you will love it). [However, with that particular coupon you have to spend way more money to save a few bucks.- did I mention - don't buy restaurant.com coupons?]  If given the choice, stick to Denny's for the food. If you are ok with cheap, bland food and looking for prompt and friendly service, try this place.

We went here at the beginning of March, so this review is LONG overdue! First off, I am far from a vegetarian and I have only had Indian food a couple of times. So was definitely skeptical when we decided to try this place. Dave told the server that we were unfamiliar with the names of the dishes and we asked him to pick out 3 entrees for us. He was EXCELLENT! Even though he had a heavy accent, he explained things to us and we told him what we liked and didn't like. His service was outstanding, attentive and we liked all of his suggestions. And of course, the food was excellent. Freshly prepared and very flavorful. I originally saved the receipt to tell everyone what to get, but I am so long overdue in writing this review the receipt was lost. :-(   Vegetarian or not, I recommend you try this place out. We will definitely be back!

We went here a few weeks ago, and I was definitly impressed! This local guy sure does know his food! GREAT FLAVOR, huge portions, reasonably priced. One small nit-the onion slices are huge, and I wasn't a big fan of that. But I recommend you try him out.

No way would I just pull over for a dog in a 'riskay' part of town...but I am sure I will be finding myself here more often!  It was late, our choices were Mexican or Burgars, but then I remembered that Dave liked this hot dog cart, so I suggested we stop here (he was thrilled). I got the loaded dog (-guac because of the avocado allergy) with a grilled bun. It was awesome. It had everything, beans, tomotoes, ketchup, mustard, sourcream and cheese. I think I may be drooling as I write the review and think about it. I wanted to eat another; but I refrained because I knew it would put me over the edge.  I don't know this chicks hours, but I am sure I will be checking in and eating at this place out more often!

We bought a package deal for this place a few months ago and finally had a chance to go last night. We arrived about 15 minutes before the show and ended up in the lower portion of the theater. (When we bought our tickets they told us we could get a refund or exchange if we didn't find seats). So the good and the bad:  Bad: I didn't care for the ticket purchasing process-too few cashiers. I didn't care for the Will-Call process either, there was not a dedicated cashier, therefore, the next available cashier took the next will-call person until that line was empty. It should be electronic or one dedicated person on busy nights (we were there on a Saturday for a 7:10 show). After getting our tickets, I was confused, the ticket said group 3, there were three lines of people with letters, but I didn't see where our theater was. (We were given no direction after we told the ticketing agent it was our first time.) We gravitated to these lines of people and saw another agent who seemed to be lining people up, we showed here our tickets and she told us our movie had been seated and to go to the hostess booth (hosted booth at a theater?)  We went to the hostess booth and they told us the theater number. Given the show had already been seated, the ticketing agent could have told us to proceed to the theater, and saved some frustration.  We entered the theater, which was full and luckily found a couple of seats.  The chairs is our section were office chairs, with wheels. I like concept, but really didn't care for the chairs themselves.  The good: You are given a menu with your tickets. After sitting down, we reviewed the menu. For a theater, I thought the selection was good, they had burgers, salads, chicken, etc... I felt the prices were very reasonable a burger and fries was $10.  We ordered a fruit and cheese plate, a burger and fries and a bottle of wine. We split everything. I liked the burger and there was a lot of fruit. I was really pleased with our meal. The service was good. I thought the servers attending to the other people below us would be in the way during the movie, but from our seats,  I didn't even notice them.   Overall, I really enjoyed the experience for a reasonable price and I would prefer this theater over my beloved Harkins. We will definately be going back!

Do you ever feel like someone is pinching your arm, with no intention of ever letting you go?  Welcome to Driver Advisors, it is that constant dull pain that you can tolerate for a short period of time, but you don't want too. Unfortunately, the law won and I got a DUI. I was clearly in the wrong and luckily nobody was hurt. I accepted responsibility and the consequences, and anyone who has gone through the experience can relate to how humiliating the entire ordeal is...court, jail, counciling and then comes along your ignition interlock device. I opted to go with driver advisors because they seemed to be the cheapest, and they were recommended by a friend (Referral $). And an added bonus, they have a mobile unit that is available once a week near my house...sounds too good to be true, right? RIGHT! The device itself has all kinds of issues...but even worse, the customer service here is horrible! For some instances, DMV dictates charges and check-ups. However, when there is a problem and I call the office, they take forever to get back to me. The unit gets caught between my seats and detaches, this is a huge issue because when this happens it needs to be checked within 6 days by the company. Highly inconvenient, especially if the car wasn't even running! (This is a programming logic error, I am 99% sure). This happened a few weeks ago, and I happen to be driving my their office, so I called to see if I could get it check right then because I wasn't able to go to the regular Tuesday mobile unit. She said they would have to call me back. She never did, so I stopped by the office and it was a $25 fee because I didn't have an appointment. Not only that, the guy behind the counter was very rude about it. I don't think anyone can drop what they are doing to accommodate Driver Advisor's schedule, but that is clearly what they expect you to do and how they behave. I know we don't have a choice in getting the device, but you most certainly have a choice in companies that provide them. There are several others I wished I would have chosen.    So, why the 2 stars vs. 1 - well, after I through a fit, one of the techs was very nice and helped me out, without charging me the $25. He tried to explain that they can't accommodate all the walk-ins, too many people just drop in to get their device services and people with appointments have to wait. I explained I called and instead of putting me on hold and seeing if they could get me in, they said they would call back. He said they use a instant messaging system in the office and that is how they do business. I give the star for this guy -- however, this business model is clearly about making money and they don't have to provide good customer service, and they don't. If you have to get a device, I urge you to check around.

We tried this place out a couple of weeks ago, and I have to save, I found a new burger spot that I enjoy.   Here are the positives: * Marketing and Identity package is a great. I love the look and feel of the place. * You can get three different size burgers, which is fantastic!  * You get a choice of buns...Awesome * They have chicken and salads on the menu...a burger joint with healthy alternatives...fantastic! * Flavored Mayos....yes!!!! * Mustard!!! * Milkshakes!!!  Because I am in love with Chipotle, I had a regular burger, on a chipotle bun and substituted Chipotle mayo instead of mustard.  Dave ordered the big burger, as it came. We shared a basket of the garlic and rosemary sweet potato fries and a NutterButter shake.   First off, if you have read my other reviews, you know I am a critical fan of sweet potato fries. These were excellent, and I did not have the desire to dip them in honey or anything else. Great twist of the flavor with the garlic and rosemary. (Even though sweet potato fries are really meant to be dipped in honey). Next, I LOVED my burger. The size was good, it was prepared well, it wasn't dry, and I loved the flavor of the chipotle. I also tasted Dave's, and it was good. He got the All American.   The negative. The service. We were  1/2 way done with our meal when I went looking for our shake. They said they couldn't find us, even though when they dropped off our food we asked about the shake. The shake was in the cooler. After we finally got it, it was great.

We tried this place out this morning. I had the banana pecan pancakes, they were huge. I added eggs and meat. The bacon was a nice cut and the sausage had great flavor. The service was good. I would have liked to have seen corned beef hash and eggs benedict on the menu, but that is just my opinion. Overall it was good and reasonably priced. I am sure we will be back.

I am a loyal Fry's shopper; however, today I became very disappointed! I was near 7th and Bell and needed just a couple of items, so I swung in here. It took me over 5 minutes to find the Cheese! I was so frustrated by the layout of this store, I went towards the big DAIRY sign, but apparently cheese is no longer catergorized as such. I can understand deviation, but toys in the middle and end-cap refriderators in odd ball sections...it just was way to difficult to find anything! They need to look at this layout and come up with something more convient for shoppers.
