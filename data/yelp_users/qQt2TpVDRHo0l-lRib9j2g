I love Nibblers!  My company has been using Nibblers Catering since before I started here (seven years ago!).  I have never had any issues.  They are never late and the food is always yummy.  Even when I am in a pinch and call last minute they are always accomodating.    I love Diane, the owner, and all of the staff at Nibblers.  I have yet to meet someone there that isn't warm and friendly.  My personal favorite is the Wrap & Roll Stuffed Tortillas.  I often get the Corporate Ladder (sandwiches and wraps) and they always go over well.  We're also big fans of the Rosemary Chicken and the Fabulous Chicken Fajitas.  The desserts are great as well!  Working with Nibblers couldn't be easier.  I call and place my order.  They show up.  That's it.  I don't have to run around preparing anything.  They do it all.  Thank you Nibblers!  You make my work life so much easier.

I am a part of a professional organization that meets twice monthly at the Fiesta Resort Conference Center.  Our pre-meeting ritual includes partaking in their happy hour specials in the restaurant bar (M - F; 4p - 7p):  $3 Well House Drinks $3 Bud Light Drafts $4 House Wine Stems $4 Craft Drafts Complimentary bites (which are yummy!)  I cannot express how much I enjoy spending time with my friend and our $3 screwdrivers and complimentary cheese!  To quote my sister, "I eat cheese like it's my job".  They have a good spread and also offer a pasta salad as well as a hot item (which varies).  We love working with the staff to set up our monthly meetings (which include dinner).  The staff here is very accomodating.    In addition to their larger conference rooms, they also have a smaller board room that they allow us to hold our monthly board meetings in.  All in all great place to attend or host an event.  Or just stop by for the happy hour. ;)

I have been to this Sonic location a number of times over the past year and a half.  Normally, the service is okay.  A little slow, but most Sonic's are so I get it.  Plus two stars because, hello... cheeseburgers.   My main complaints:  Incorrect Orders: This I can overlook.  They don't always screw up my order, but when they do I'm too lazy to turn around and go back.  Obviously I'm lazy - I'm eating at Sonic!  However, this is a fast food chain and when are places like this not screwing something up?  Minus zero stars because screwing up orders is like part of their identity or something.   Bug in My Food: Last year I found a huge (to me, I'm a baby when it comes to bugs) flying ant in my tator tots.  Yuck.  Minus one star because bugs are gross but I'm still a reasonable person.  It's not like it went in my mouth or anything.   Nail Clipping in My Slush: Who doesn't love a Lemon Berry Slush?  Me. Now.  Ever since this weekend when I sucked up a nail clipping that is.  Yes, a nail clipping.  In my mouth.  Minus two stars because it touched my insides.  And it was yellow-ish and unkempt.   No more, Sonic.  No more.  Keep your bugs and bits of body parts to yourself.  Note: As of this writing, this location is closed and roped off.  What did other people find this weekend?

I am a big fan of Sushi 101 for happy hour.  Where else can I get $2.50 well screwdrivers and a Philly Roll for $3.50?  And happy hour every day?  Yes please.  Is the sushi the best around? Nah.  Are their regular menu prices that great? Meh.  Is the service good?  Usually.  Am I in love with their happy hour? YES.  I love sitting at the sushi bar and chatting with the guys making my yummy food.  They are always friendly and good for conversation.   I recently hosted a Meetup event here and everyone had a great time.  We had about 20 people on the patio.  Service was great and they were very accomodating.    I'm in love with the Godzilla Roll!

I have been living The Lofts at Rio Salado since May 2008. I live in the S1 model (studio) on the 2nd floor of the 'E' building so almost everything in this review is based on my experience in the 'E' building.  I enjoy everything about my apartment. The layout is great and there is a lot of space. The walk-in closet and bathroom are larger than the closet and master bathroom I had at my old house. There is a good sized storage closet on the patio. There is also additional storage available to rent in the underground garages. I enjoy the double arcadia doors leading to my patio, it makes the apartment seem very open and light. The little fireplace is a nice touch as well. It turns on with the flip of a switch and you can adjust the heat level at the panel on the bottom.  The apartment complex itself is divided by Center Parkway with the 'E' building on the east side of Center Parkway and the rest of the buildings and the office and gym on the west side of Center Parkway.   The type of people that live here all seem to be college students or young professionals. I don't know of any families living here, which is great because there aren't any kids running around.  Each building has a gated, underground parking lot with assigned parking. Each apartment is allotted one underground parking spot. You can rent additional parking spaces underground for $50 per month.   I have only had to call maintenance two times for a non-routine issue. Both of which were regarding my dryer which was taking about 2 - 2.5 hours to dry each load. Both times I requested maintenance for my dryer I used the online request system and they showed up within 24 hours. Everyone on the maintenance staff seems very friendly. Whenever any of them drive past me in the parking lot they smile and wave. One person in particular often reminds me to put in a request to change my air filter every month, which I do, and it is changed within 24 hours.  There are a lot of complaints that the walls are thin. I don't necessarily agree. I do not hear any noise from my neighbors with the exception of two parties held over the summer.  Let's talk more about noise.  The Lofts at Rio Salado are located under the flight path of Sky Harbor Airport so when planes are landing they come in pretty low over the complex and can be very loud. On the south side of the complex is a train. On the north side of the complex is the light rail which can be pretty noisy itself (especially when it passes by every 10 minutes). Also on the north side of the complex is Washington Street and on the west side of the 'E' building is Center Parkway. The traffic from both streets can be extremely noisy even though they aren't the busiest of streets. My apartment faces Washington St. and the light rail and it is quite loud, although, I've become accustomed to it and can tune it out now. I don't even hear the planes overhead anymore. The only time I notice the sound these days is when I have my windows open and am trying to watch TV, otherwise, the noise is pretty easy to ignore once you get used to it.  One recommendation I'd make is to not choose an apartment that faces the interior as sound really travels up between the buildings. I'd also be careful not to choose an apartment near a gate as they can be pretty loud opening and closing all day & night.  I'd also recommend the 'E' building over the other buildings as I've been told the others are extremely noisy due to the sheer number of people.  The grounds are always kept neat. The maintenance staff and the landscapers (which come on Fridays) do a good job taking care of the place.  -Likes-  -Elevators  -Trash chutes (so convenient) -Pools (love the cabanas and lounge areas) -Gym (modern equipment, clean) -Social events (catered lunches at the pool, etc) -Dry cleaning service -Proximity to the new light rail -I also like the fact that it is in a somewhat open area and not jammed between other complexes or buildings  -Dislikes-  -Because of the light rail, it's difficult to make left turns out of the complex (and the light at Parkside Dr. is sloooow). In order to get to the freeway (202) from the 'E' building you need to go through the whole complex and circle around which it feels like a whole lot of backtracking.  It can be difficult getting in to the complex depending on where you're coming from due to the light rail and slow changing lights. -Slighty overpriced -No nearby grocery stores, shopping or gas stations (I do my grocery shopping at Wal-Mart at Mesa Riverview or at Fry's on 44th St. and Thomas)  Overall, I would recommend the Lofts at Rio Salado.

I visited Hanny's with some lady friends for dinner and drinks.  Loved the drink list - so much to choose from.  Quite pricey though.  My mojito cost nearly as much as my pizza (okay, maybe not, but still!).  Speaking of pizza, it was YUMMY.  I had the Bianco pizza which came recommended from the waiter.  It was thin crust and very spicy, which is weird considering I hate thin crust pizza and super spicy food??  Despite that, I am somehow in love with the Bianco pizza.  We visited on a Monday night so things were pretty quiet at Hanny's.  I'd love to go back (any day of the week)!

I love this Starbucks and everyone that works here.  They're awesome!  Everyone in my office is a big fan and we can be found here often.  I do wish it were a bit bigger as it can get a little cramped at times.  My only aggrevation with this location is in regards to the ill-mannered (or are they just entitled?) customers in the drive thru that think it's okay to block the driveway (and sometimes even line up in the street) because they apparently can't be bothered to park and walk inside.  Honestly, I would love to know what is going on in the heads of these people when they are nonchalantly parked diagonally across the driveway, clearly preventing people from entering or exiting the parking lot.  Perhaps ignorance really IS bliss.
