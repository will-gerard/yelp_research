My parents live very close to the brewery/beer garden and it is so much fun to hang out there in the summer.  The garden often hosts events and fundraisers.  Sometimes there is a band or live karaoke!!  There is a neat stage and tons of picnic tables.  The brewery has a sitting area inside where the tour ends.  The tour is a good time as well!  The only downside is the lack of parking.  They have a small lot but we usually have to park on the street.  I wish this beer garden was located in warmer weather so I could enjoy it all year long!

AZ restaurant week inspired me to try a new place.  We made a reservation, were sat immediately, but man, our server was awkward.  I felt like he kept repeating everything i said in this voice that was questioning my every choice.  I was open to a suggestion if he had one...but he didnt offer much.  Everyone else we made contact with was great - bartender helped my husband with a gin selection, other servers stopped by and asked how everything was...everyone else seemed extremely friendly.  But our guy, uh...not so much.  It appeared the AZ Restaurant week menu was our only option for dinner.  I was disappointed in all our selections.  The charcuterie plate with sliced prosciutto and stuffed cherry peppers was, in a word, lame. My husband had the pork belly and it had good flavor, but the presentation was really lacking.  He had the lamb burger that came with some Mcdonalds style fries and I had the fried eggplant.  Neither dish had much flavor. Salt and pepper on the table would have been a nice option - maybe thats not hip and cool anymore?  Dessert attempted to save the meal - the chocolate bouchon was pretty amazing.  The sorbet was good as well.  Overall, I was disappointed.  It seemed like it should be a nice place and maybe we just had a bad roll of the dice that night...but I never got to see what they have on the regular menu.  I might try it again to try a cheese plate but I dont think its going into my restaurant rotation.

Seriously, why did NO ONE tell me about this place?  i had a random bread bowl craving (a la Perkins, which dont seem to exist here) and per yelp reviews, Duck and Decanter had them.  And sure enough they did!  This place totally surpassed all my expectations.  Employees are SUPER friendly, food is so good (spinach salad - yum, firey italian sandwich was amazing) and there is a little wine and beer bar tucked in the corner.  This place had me grinning ear to ear like a fool.  Makes me happy and i can't wait to go back!

Super cute dive bar with friendly staff and patrons.  Cheap drinks, darts and a jukebox are entertaining.  Loved it!

I love the thin crust classic signature.  So does my mom.  My husband thinks the sauce is too sweet...but his opinion doesn't really count.  I tried the antipasto with the house italian.  pretty decent salad for a pizza joint!  We ordered online and picked it up...I am always a fan of not having to call and place an order.  I have an aversion to talking on the phone.  I have no idea why.

We went for the Sunday night karaoke.  The karaoke guy was a scary lookin mo fo.  But the song selection blew my mind.  I sang Bjork, people!  My friend Jason sang MIKA.  I was in heaven.  Some jack ass freaked out - kicking tables and shit around - while attempting to sing "Don't Stop Believin"  That was annoying.  I think if the karaoke guy hadn't been out smoking, he would have throttled the guy.  But who knows.  DJ Scary is on my good side though - he gave us a free bottle of champagne at the end of the night.  He mumbled something about a contest but not enough people sticking around.  Free booze = good times.  Anyhoo, I also had breakfast here twice.  It was alright.  But nothing will ever top Smut N Eggs for breakfast in Madison.  It's just not possible.

I'd driven by this place a few times and wanted to try it.  When my adorable uncle and his partner came to town, I jumped at the chance to give it a go.  I made a reservation on opentable (it being a Friday night and all) and was glad I did.  The parking lot was full and people were milling about out front.  We were sat right away.  The place seems a little small but has a great layout and decor.  The menu was small and unique.  I can't remember what everyone had but my uncle had a dish with an espresso and vanilla bean sauce on the protein.  It sounded weird but he raved over it.  I had the pork loin and cleaned my plate.  We started out with guac and when we ran out of chips, they offered more.  For dessert, the chocolate torte was super yummy.  The gelato trio was good too.  I'm so happy to live near such a great restaurant!  We'd been having really bad luck with restaurants lately...thank you to Sierra Bonita for breaking the streak!

I was tipped off about this place by a co-worker.  We made a last minute decision to eat dinner here, instead of the Vig on Easter Sunday night.  So glad we did!  The food was awesome.  The Skewers were great and the BBQ flatbread pizza was huge.    We drove around a bit for fear of parking in a spot that wasn't the Hideaway's...but when we got inside there is a sign that says you can park ANYWHERE in the lot and not get towed.  Just an FYI.  I thought the two guys that were tag-team bartending/serving were very attentive.  And I'm a server so my standards are kind high.

Don't ever eat here. I'll never go back. It only got one star specifically because it did serve me food and drink. Unfortunately, the service was horrible (and i'm a server) - and it took over 1.5 hours for us to get four sandwiches. We got no explanation and no apology. We were only able to get one beer refill during that period of time. And for four people, our bill ended up being a ridiculous amount of money! Don't do it...you'll hate yourself after wards.    I'm pretty sure everyone else giving it five stars must be sleeping with someone that works there.

I pretty much call everyone "tuna" so I had a feeling Wild Tuna would do me good.  And it did!  It's an obviously family owned joint and as the owner put it, he's "a bit of a mad scientist".  We tried 3 of the special rolls - all were great.  The presentation was awesome.  Especially the Salmon and Garfunkel - when they served it, "fifty ways to leave your lover" was playing in the background.... I was amused.  Our order came out one item at a time so we werent overwhelmed.  We spent $65 for two people before tip.  We sat at the bar and just, honestly, had a great time.  We aren't sashumi snobs - just wanted some decent sushi.  And this place hit the mark!  I want to go back and leave room for some sushi style dessert.  Tonight's special was the Elvis - peanut butter and banana in a spring roll, topped with chocolate sauce and whip cream.  Hope it's there when we go back!

Worst car wash I've ever had.  Inside of the car was barely touched.  And I tipped $5 - should of known when the lady that told me it was done kept apologizing...PS 5 star reviews are because they give you a free car wash for a great review.

I do not get the draw.  Always packed, mediocre food and service.  Are we THAT desperate for a decent restaurant in the East Valley that we have to resort to this place?

Jason was great - drove all the way from the valley to N Central, Phoenix 2 times and we learned so much from him.  He's the only pest guy I'd ever used.  The treatments worked too.    Now I've moved out near where his business is located (E Mesa - same ZIP CODE even) and he won't return my calls.  Got too big for his britches, I guess.  Wish I hadn't talked him up to my friends and family - its embarrassing when he doesn't return their calls either.

I just want to preface this by saying I LOVE to go out to eat.  And I am not picky and NOT hard to please.  But last night's dinner was one of the top 3 worst dinning experiences of my life.  I don't think the night could of possibly gone worse.  We walked in and were completely ignored.  Servers acted like we were in the way (there was no where to go - didnt they just remodel?  Couldnt they fix that?). And the restaurant was practically empty.  Finally someone came up to us and asked to help us.  I told them we had a reservation and they started to walk us to a table.  The aisle is only one person wide and he walked us to a table full of people.  He said "oops, that was wrong, I guess we are going over there..." so we all had to turn around and shimmy down the aisle to the OTHER side of the restaurant.  We were sat in a booth for a few moments when we were approached by an employee who told us we couldnt sit there and the person who sat us "was just a busser."  Um, WTF?  So we are moved to a 1/2 booth/table.  Finally sat, a server immediately approaches us and asked if we would like something to drink or an appetizer.  Um, just sat down, super annoyed, can i get a minute to recover please?    And this server then proceeded to suck my will to live the rest of the night.  More on that later, though.  It is ridiculously dark in the restaurant.  Like, cannot see jack dark.  And the pillows in the booths kind of gross me out...like sleeping in a stranger's bed with dirty sheets.  And bottom line, the food isnt good enough to put up with price and the hassle of valet parking.  My mother in laws steak was well done when she ordered it medium.  My "stuffed" pork chop didnt appear to have anything in it.  But again, it was so dark I could of been eating a bear for all I know.  Back to the server.  She would take our order, not write it down and come back FIVE MINUTES LATER and double check with us what we ordered.  And her guess was wrong!  She did it with the drink order AND the food order.  So I guess it makes sense the steak was incorrectly cooked...  End of drinner, we just want to get the hell out...server takes the bill and credit card, brings it back with no receipt to sign.  And of course never comes back.  We had to hunt someone down and he brought us back the recipt to sign.  Sigh.  At the very end of the night, we then get stuck waiting in a line for the valet.  Some lady butted in front at the line.  Unfortunately for her, she got the brunt of my frustrations.  Poor gal was probably just as scarred by her shitty dinning experience.

scheduled a micro-needling and added on a peel as recommended.  ann was awesome.  she's funny, knowledgeable and she must know what she's doing, because the spots on my face have faded so much with the procedure and the products she recommended.  I also like that you can book online.  definitely going back!

Service was slow at the beginning but i found out later he's on work release from tent city.  So all is forgiven.  Good happy hour, cute place plus an elderly couple was making out by my friend's car when we left.  Good times!  PS i got a ride home, since hearing tent city dui stories made me not want to join anyone there...

We were here on a late Saturday afternoon.  We ended up sitting right near where the bored servers hang out,  We cared.  They didn't.  It was really irritating because it was already hard to hear in the restaurant.  I think the high ceiling must make voices carry...  Our appetizer was the house made potato chips with crab dip.  It was weird.  They would have been ok seperately but they just do not go together at all.   The $5 burger was fine.  I live pretty close, so I wanted to like it.  But it was just a weird experience.    Maybe it was just an early Saturday night thing - but it looked like a elderly HH hot spot at the bar.

Beautiful patio seating, friendly staff and great food.  I cannot say enough good things about their pork products.  Best bacon ever.  Beer selection rocks.  It's become "the place" we take out of town guests.

I love everything about this place.  The food (particularlly the wings) is incredible, the drink list makes me happy (the balsalmic bloody mary is great), the brunch is excellent, the patio rocks, and best of all?  I'VE NEVER HAD BAD SERVICE HERE.  Hurray Timo.  Hurray.

Has a lovely decore and ambiance.  We had questions about wine and we were helped by a wine expert, who nailed what we were looking for on the first try. Food was pretty good, I had the sea bass - I loved the brussel sprouts with it but wished it came with a less heavy barley/gravy type bed under it.  My companion has salmon, which also came on a bed of some sort of heavier side dish.  I would suggest just letting the fish star in the show :) I may stick to appetizers next visit.  The bruchetta choices were unique and tasty.  I'm going back this week with a different friend.  Great place to take out of towners!

Arrived at 10am on a Saturday, and we appeared to just beat the brunch rush.  I had the tofu burrito and loved it.  I really loved the salsa it came with, too.  I didnt try anyone else's food at my table because I was obsessed with my entree.  The have a full coffee bar but we stuck with diet coke.  My husband had 2 sodas - no free refills here, they have no fountain drinks, only bottles - and the server was all like, "Do you really need ANOTHER diet coke?"  Girl, quit judging.  We all have our problems.  They have a small dog friendly patio but people seemed to "camp" at the 3 tables - I would be hesitant to bring my dog for fear I'd have to wait for a outside table.

NOM NOM NOM.  Very clean, everything tastes very fresh.  The salsa bar is as good as everyone says.  The fries were tasty too.  I think their shrimp is slightly better than their fish.  I normally hate corn tortillas, but was fine with these.  Buy 2 get one free on Tuesdays!  In the strip mall facing Walmart next to Panda Express.

I WANT to love this place.  I work nearby and tried the order online/pickup route.  I'm on an HCG diet ...so it was $14 for a Chinese food rice size box of veggies with an ounce of meat.  You get used to over -paying on HCG.  The HCG diet is full of disappointing lunch take out options - but hey - with this I could go the pick up route and specify no cheese, sauce on the side etc.  The website makes you pay with a credit card but when I showed up for pick up, I was told I had to pay at the store.  The food was ok.  but I noticed 2 days later I was double charged.  I tried to call and complain but while on hold for the manager I was hung up on.  I gave them a 2nd chance today.  I paid $20+ today for a $6 12 oz juice drink (I have a cold..am obviously also in the wrong business) and a $10 lunch entree minus cheese, nuts and olives. I picked up my order but they didn't have my juice..,,when I asked, they quickly found it in the fridge.  I left, confident because my box had the name of my dish written on the side.  Got back to work and it was completely wrong.  It had cheese, it had black beans and essentially made me super sad I gave them a second chance and spent $14 on a box of spinach and shrimp where I picked around half of it off.  Overall I'm just disappointed - wondering where my money went and had that sad, shitty monday where you opened up an entree box and see a bunch of stuff you can't eat.  I have expectations - I waited tables a ton and my parents owned a restaurant.  I just expect $20 food when I buy $20 food.

Random seafood and a semi celebratory night brought us here.  Came way late, sat at the bar, immediately made friends with chefs, server and hostess.  All were very gracious and made us feel welcome.  Appetizer - beer clams. So good.  Not too salty even though there was pancetta in the broth.  Pickled red onions were an unexpected touch but so good.  We split the gumbo and it was great.  Their homemade hot sauce is to die for.  Overall, you probably shouldn't go here because they are gonna get so popular and i will have to make a Monday night reservation! ;)

love the service, love the food, love that they drop a little knowledge on you as well.  beer selection is pretty decent, as is the atmosphere.  One of my favorite places to eat - it's interactive and fun!  Reasonably priced, as well.
