This review is for their breakfast, in which case Essence has the "crispy" in baked items down. I had the chance to try their classic breakfast sandwich and the chocolate croissant. The breakfast sandwich is $5.50 with $1 add-ons for ham or bacon, $0.85 for avocado and $1 to switch to a butter croissant. Before I continue, I must say the toasted bun was what made this breakfast sandwich above standard. The toasted, crispy bun adds a great texture as you bite into the softer inside of cheese, eggs and ham.   As someone with a smaller appetite, I opted to add ham and the portion was just right. If you're hungrier, a fully packed sandwich with croissants may be a better option.   In regards to the chocolate croissant, it was delicious. Chocolate was rich but not overly sweetened and again, the flaky and crispy croissant exterior was divine. I've heard a French man in a Rolls Royce comes and orders a box of chocolate croissant every week, so it must be worth it right?

Sorry but the two stars is for the duck buns. A friend of mine recommended this place and I was really hoping I'd be bringing the rating UP, rather than down. Very disappointed. These duck buns have way too much hoisin sauce and are too salty with barely any duck for $17. The Belgian ale they recommend with it is a plus though. Dark and sweet. If you're coming here, the better bet might be the sliders. After all, it is a bar.   One plus: their patio is pretty nice if you're looking for a calmer atmosphere. Great for people watching.

The perfect midday pick-me-up. Snoh has options for the Asian preferences (black sesame, matcha, Thai tea, taro snoh), general fruity flavors (honey dew, coconut, and mango), and more.   Come to snoh for a single small shaved ice bowl for yourself, a large snoh (with options of more than one flavor) to share with a group or sweet drinks to take to go. It's a great spot that serves people of various sweet preferences!

1 star: Cute and cozy atmosphere - I'm pretty sure it's a home transformed into a cafe  2 star: Very friendly and hardworking staff (there was only one girl at the front of house and she was quick, attentive AND nice!) 3 star: Delicious coffee - though I wasn't a fan of the horchatte  4 star: Delicious food - highly recommend the jalape√±o waffles and vegetable scramble- but the portions are not the most generous.   I saw games on the side- could be a fun midday coffee hang out spot!
