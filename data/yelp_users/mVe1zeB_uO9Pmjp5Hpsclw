I am a member of the Arizona Business connection; we had our weekly meeting there for years.  With that said, I go there often and always have great service and good food, I got into eating Oatmeal and I had asked if they had Raisins, " No" said the server, next week when I order Oatmeal and small cup of Raisins were serviced to me!    Friday night Fish Fry is Awesome!  There is a Bar that is separated from the Restaurant.    Great Place!!

German Restaurant After getting out of the ARMY and had spent 3 years in Hanau Germany, I was in search for a great Schnitzel.  My wife and I drove to Sun City, Glendale and on Indian school to find a good Schnitzel.  My first visit to Zur Kate in the early 80's, my kids we small and now I bring my Grandkids.  Great Food, Great Service, the best Schnitzel in Arizona and their Beer selection is true to form - Awesome!  Their food and the atmosphere is true to the regain, Do yourself a favor and give them a try!  Their live accordion player brings it all together

I was in having my tires rotated, the tire technician mistakenly broke or stripped the lug that holds the rim to the car. the manager gave me a coupon and sent me to a repair facility to have the damaged lug replaced. the repair facility prioritized my repair, I was in an out of there in about 25 minutes plus the invoice discount tires . I returned to discount tires on Main Street and Recker Road to verify the torque on the lug nuts were correct. once more I was prioritized In N Out in less than 5 minutes. outstanding service highly recommended. oh by the way did I mention I had purchased my tires and rims some discount because of their outstanding service

I went to Lucille's Smokehouse Bar-B-Que last week, loved the atmosphere, service was different, it was good but different (we must of had 3 different people assigned to our table of two).  I had Brisket and it had a perfect smoke ring around the upper layer, tender and I must admit it was almost as good as what I make.  I had a Margarita that was good as they come. Laura and I shared a Red Velvet cake - heavenly.  The reason I gave a 4 star would have to be the fried onion rings - when the manager walks by a table and asked "How is everything" you would think He or She would notice the full basket of fried onion rings, almost untouched!  I I said Greasy, that would not begin to cover them.  I thought the Manager or one of our servers would have asked  "Was there something wrong with your fried onion rings", but NO.  I will go back and will recommend to anyone to try them out But stay away from the fried and overly Greasy onion rings.

liar liar your pants are on FIRE!  Needing a Mobile Hotspot, I asked about speed  "Almost as fast as COX". I asked about Battery life "4 to 5 days of standby & 24 to 36 hours of continuous use".  14 day trail. Download speed of (myspeedtest.org), required 2.5 MBPS to pass T Mobile standards the My Hotspot got 1.2 4 out of 5 time, the 5th time it got 2.75, customer service guy said "It Passed" so we ran the test once more, 1.2 mbps - I said "once out of six is not passing in my book".  I agreed to pay the $200 early termination fee that cost me $230.71 (Don't know why) plus $90 for the device that doesn't work.  I'm self employed, if I treated my customers like this I would be on the streets.  Shame - shame on T Mobile, they SUCK! PS: I went in on the 15th day to cancel - My-bad!

No That was all the the floor associate in the curtain mini blind section of the store could say. No,  no I can't and no we don't.    I had some louver window shades cut, my measurements were off in the shades are a little bit too big. I went to the Lowes store on Higley and southern, their answer was sure no problem glad to help but our machines broken. The Elsword store must teach their employees just to say No!

Supper Easy to work with, took my idea, came up with a Business card that looks amazing, tool the layout and came up with a Rack card and a 3x8 banner.  Also the turn around time was extremely fast.   Highly recommend this company to anyone with printing needs.

Look out for this one!!! Joined thinking this could help promote my Business, Right.  Ordered some Diamond Back tickets, explained to the VCA person that I have never went to a game, didn't know the seating chart and wanted good seats.  Adviser said he they had seats on  the First base line 14 seats up, $75 per seat, not bad, sounds like a deal to me.  So I took it.  get to the game and  picked up my tickets, $29 seats, 14 rows from the back of Right Field.   Now VCA is doing nothing to help!  RIP OFF! Unless your selling Amway or somethin, RUN Don"t walk from this scam!

I called Best Glass out to a building I was Inspecting for a Investor.  Ask them to give a price to replace all the Old glass with Dual Pane Low e and to replace the old Sky Light with the same, this was on the 8th of July.  Estimator said he took a bunch of pictures and that he would go back to the Office an work on it.  6 days later I call an asked about the bid, "Oh we don't do Skylights they said", really, you couldn't call and tell me this!  OK how about the window replacements, give us till the end of the day and will get a EST out to you.  Then they say, we went back an gave the Owner a price to replace the broken window.  Don't care about what other business you do, how about my estimate to replace the windows with Dual Pain low e.   I called back Saturday and go the run-around and the person working on that is off today!  I'm working on Saturday, working trying to get my customers a window replacement coast.   Just left me hanging out there looking, they just didn't care about me or my customer -

Hats off to a painless Dental experience, Dr. Michael Kaye, Dr. Chen-Kaye and their staff make you feel like you been going there for years, kind-of like your family.  You almost feel good about having them scraping your tarter away (Not really - it's still a trip to the Densest office).    All I can say it that it is affordable, painless and ease, you cant ask for anything better than that!

I was having a large party at my home.  Two days before the event we discovered a Hot Water slab leak under the Dining room floor.  Eagle Service covered the walls of my Dining room, open the cement floor, found and repaired the leak and patched the cement.  When they left the job, you would have never known there was extensive work performed in that room.   Affordable, Fast, Friendly and service you can trust.  I have recommended Eagle Service to my Family, friends and to all my customers.    Just a note:  I'm a small business owner and I rely on my reviews to generate business leads through Yelp and other services like this one.  To tarnish a business with a 1 star review for not returning a sales call - Really!! Did you call Eagle back during normal business hours? , Shame on you Sir for giving this company a low rating for such a minimal thing and shame on Yelpforf not deleting your review !!

I had two Web sites for my business, one for Home Inspections and the other one for Mold testing.  The sites were built in early 2009, to what was known to be what Google was looking for, back then - lots of content and links out to other sites.  They worked, but outdated and needed a update.  I shopped around; hired one guy that built the Home Inspection site, took him six months but never finished the job. Hired a second person that said no problem, easy peasy lemon squeezy but he never got started on the Job an ended up saying the site was to complex for his skill level.  I was referred to Phil McKeown, we talked over a Coffee, I explained my needs and concerns.  I check out a Site or two he worked on and earlier this year Phil helped me build a new website for my business.  I had a ton of content from my previous site - he helped pull out, reorganize and highlight the most important stuff.   Feel free to check it out, within 6 months we were getting nice page ranking on Google - I'm Back on first page in several areas and it's only getting better.  http://alatisinspectionservice.com/  Google Local / Plus - I had also hired a company to help with my online presents.  It was a complete mess, more than what I could handle.  I asked Phil about looking into my accounts on Google, he helped me combine 3 different Google Business accounts: 1 had the right address, 1 had my reviews and the last was connected to YouTube.  It was a lot more complicated than I thought, but Phil made sure nothing was lost.  That was really important since I'd lost reviews in the past with that last company I hired.  Finally Phil's been helping with my approach to social media, specifically Facebook.  He's advised on the best approach to take with both my business and personal accounts to help increase exposure and reach.    More so I feel that when I call Phil, it is like I'm his most important customer (although I see the big corporate names he represents and my company is small frys in comparison).    Feel free to contact me if you have concerns about hiring MCKEOWN MARKETING - Happy to talk!

OMG their the Best Donuts in Arizona.   I grew up in New York an a good donut is at the grocery store but the small Donut shops were the best.   Craving Donuts would rank up there in the top 5.  Service is also top ranking an friendly.   Their  on Main Street  just west of Power road well worth the drive

First time visiting here, will not be my last.   Had a slice of Peach Mango pie,  crust is amazing (reminds me of Marie Callendars crust).   Also had a old favorite, Chicken Pot pie,  delicious!   Service was friendly, family run business that makes you feel at home.    Highly recommended this place for a To Go pie or sit in lunch.
