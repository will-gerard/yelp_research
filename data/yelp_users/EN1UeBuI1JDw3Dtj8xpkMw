What is more fun than your first visit to this comic book store? Going to the Marvel Star Wars launch day party with members of the Dune Sea Garrison, Mos Eisley Base, and Mandalorian Mercs. Friendly staff and a well stocked store that is worth the drive. Definitely look forward to shopping here again.

Our favorite comic book shop. On Free Comic Book Day each person can pick out a free comic and they also have tables with additional vendors just for the event. The staff has always been pleasant. Parking can be a challenge in their small parking lot, but parking across the street is usually available for a small fee. Aisles are tight but that just means more cool stuff to enjoy.

Would give it a zero if that was an option. Will not ever eat here again. It used to be a great place to eat but new management changed it all. Waited 50 minutes for our order to be taken. Our party of eight was already seated and knew what we wanted but they only took the drink orders. We were told they were out of French fries when requested as part of the kids meal. The steak was brought raw so they took it back, cooked it, and served it on the exact same plate as the raw steak. Took three tries to finally get a steak that wasn't still moving and a clean plate. We were treating the kids to dessert because the kid's meals had incredibly tiny portions but after almost three hours there we went next door to Walmart to get dessert. While there we saw the general manager buying a cartload of generic frozen French fries. Definitely not worth the money or time spent.

Every year Joe does a customer appreciation meal which brings out long lines that are worth it. Delicious hamburgers and plenty of outside seating to enjoy, especially during the spring and winter months. Beautiful gigantic trees provide plenty of shade. Kid's meals include a sucker.

Been here twice. Both times they took the egg from my tray and put it in the other bowl at our table even though the bowls were on separate trays. When you have food allergies, this is a problem. Liked the food, just not confident they can take care of food allergies well.

Woody makes this the best place to get donuts. Always providing a laugh, he brightens our day. Wish more places had a friendly face like him.

My husband surprised me for my birthday by special ordering a cake from Cakes By Cupcake. They perfectly captured my love of Disney by creating a Minnie Mouse cake. I was surprised and delighted by the design and taste of the cake. It was my favorite birthday cake ever.  Jessica also makes wonderful cupcakes for Mom's Nite Out events I host. At the last event she provided both Mimosa and Cherry Coke cupcakes for every mom. Her cupcakes are full of flavor and moist. I look forward to hosting these events just for the cupcakes alone!

Freaky golfing from the third story without falling off. Definitely try it at night with the lighted holes. Private parties are fun and the food is so good you would swear they didn't actually cook it there, but they do.

Old school gaming alongside current gaming consoles is a great combination for everyone. Gamers can just hang out too or celebrate with friends. Wish this was around when I went to ASU. Fun for adults and families, with minors allowed until 10 pm.
