I got new windows about a year ago. I really enjoyed working with this company. They were timely, gave a great quote and the windows arrived earlier than their estimated time. They were installed in one day and look great. And I've notice a great decrease to my electricity bill now that I have dual pained windows. I waited a year to make sure there were no issues that came up, but I can say that I probably love them even more now. I will be getting the remaining windows replaced soon, as I only had the bedrooms replaced originally.

I have been to this particular store before and have had decent service and food, but I will NOT go here again.    After a long day of errands I stopped here on my way home.  First off the speaker system was so bad the lady inside had a hard time understanding what I wanted and I had to repeat things 2 or more times.  Then once I got home I found that half of my order was missing and the part that was there was burnt beyond being edible.  The chicken was so burnt and dry I can't imagine why anyone would serve it, the fries looked like they had been in the fryer for way too long and then had been sitting out for hours.  The only thing I was able to eat out of the whole thing was the tortillas and even they were cold by time I got home.  I would have gone back to complain and get my money back but didn't want to waste my time on a lousy fast food place.

Horrible service and management.  We reserved an area for 25 people for a night out with friends. We get there to find that they gave us space for about 12 people, crammed between two kid's birthday parties.  They refused to move us and didn't refund us the money we had to pay to reserve one of the ramadas. Don't even get me started on why there were having an 8 yr olds party at a bar at 9 pm. I mean...WTF. Anyways, the waitress would disappear for 30 minutes at a time, forgot to place some of our food orders, so we were still waiting for them over an hour later. Our drinks would take at least 20 minutes to arrive, along with a list if who was at fault this time for the wait, and guess what... It was never her fault. When the food would finally come it was warm to cold, so it wasn't even edible.   It was supposed to be a fun night with friends, but instead we had to deal with the shitty situation which ruined the evening.   They lost a bunch of customers, but the way they treated us they probably don't even care.

Extremely rude and inappropriate hostess who seats out of order. I had been waiting for a table for over 10 minutes. Two gentlemen walk in and are seated right away. How does this happen? This was over my lunch hour, a small window of time to eat and get back to the office, and was a complete waste of time.

After hearing all the wonderful reviews of this company I am in complete shock at how awful the service was.  The lights should have gone off when they changed my quoted time of arrival days before, pushing my close time frame even more and again when the truck finally arrived 3 hours later than planned. The crew of two spent a total of 6 + hours moving when I was quoted no more than 4 as well, sending what I thought would be a reasonable price skyrocketing.  I was constantly finding one of the workers standing around, not doing much of anything, while the other one did all the work at what was probably his best, but still the worst mover I have encountered.  To top it all off many pieces of furniture were damaged.  My guest bed was gouged and the facing fell off on multiple sides.  The worker blamed it on the heat, however it was nailed together and was a quality piece of furniture, not glued (which could have made sense if it were in deed heat related), it was clearly from it being dragged and banged against walls.  They also unwrapped some pieces that I had wrapped for protection and low and behold those pieces were damaged too.  I hope that this is a rare coincidence to their service, however I will not take that chance again.

This is more of a review of the office staff as the actual movers never made it into my home. When booking they wrote my phone number down wrong. May not seem like a big deal but living in a condo they needed it to gain access to the community. When they were 30 min late I called the office, yet they were closed still, no way of contacting the driver or asking where my movers were.  Called back when they were supposed to be open, yet still got a voicemail. Left one stating to call call back about my appointment but they never did.  Finally 2.5 hours later I called again and when I asked why the movers never showed up I found out what happened with the phone number. Was told by Andy that it was my fault and I should have answered the numerous calls they made to me and that they were waiting outside the gate ( which they were not when I did go down to check!)...maybe they should take their own advice and check their own voicemail every once in a while.  If they would have answered the phone or checked the voicemail in a timely manner they probably would have still been able help me out instead of being 2 hours into the next client's move.  Yes, I  know this was an accident, but since I  had to take time off work, waste a day sitting in a condo, have to wait another week (past move out date) and take even more time off for the next move I think that was a pretty big and expensive mistake.  Needless to say I found another company to help me out and I MADE SURE they had my info right.  When a business contract is made over the phone you assume that the person can take accurate notes and be reliable.  I found both to be lacking in this office and why they lost my business.

Went in today to check out the home visit prices and see what all they had to offer.   Walking into the place you got hit by a wall of odor.  I know having lots of dogs in a small space won't make any room smell like roses, however I would like to think that they clean the place every once in a while.  I then asked about a service listed on the flyer and the website and was told that they don't do that.  Then why list it???  I also didn't like how from the front office you couldn't see into where they kept the dogs, though I could hear them all going crazy.  On my way out I realized that you could see in through the side from broken blinds.  There were a ton of dogs in a small space with no one in sight.  Also, side note from looking at the pictures on yelp...Yes, they have couches instead of cages but those couches look dangerous since they are so broken. I wouldn't wan my dog sitting on or running near that.  Since I haven't actually used the service I won't give it only one star, but from what I've seen I will not be back or calling for home service thats for sure.  It would have been perfect too, since I live only a mile away.

So, I finally decided to try out a clinic to help me lose weight.  I did my research and decided on Medshape.  Called and scheduled a 9am appointment...first one of the day.  I get there and sign in -even though there is no one at the desk- and have a seat in their cramped waiting room.  5, 10, 15 minutes later someone pops there head in and asks if I am here.  Ummm...I did sign in.  She says she will be right back with paperwork. Five minutes later she says to come with me and closes me in a freezing office to fill out paperwork.  I finish it in 2 minutes and open the door as directed.  And I wait, and wait, and wait.  I'd finally had enough and get up to ask someone what the heck is going on.  But guess what...no staff in sight.  I walk to the front, and again there is nobody at the reception desk.  So I walk out...at 10am.  So, I was there for an hour and saw nobody.  I haven't even received a call asking what happened or giving an excuse as to why they kept me waiting for an hour.  I guess they don't need business if this is how they treat new potential clients.

I had Wave come do a deep cleaning for me to get ready for a big get together I was having.  I was very underwhelmed with what I came home to.  The mirrors still had fingerprints and smudges, the ceiling fans/light fixtures weren't dusted, neither were the baseboards.  The couch wasn't vacuumed either.  Also, the woman who came complained about the extras that I had added on with the scheduler, which was totally inappropriate.  I was really looking for a service to come every other week but this one will NOT be it.

After I let Juan know how unsatisfied I was with the person who came out he was very apologetic and offered to make it right.  Amber came out to fix what was not done the first time and she did a very good job.  I was impressed with the professionalism from management and his sincere desire to make sure I was happy with the service I received.

Aaron of Paramount Plumbing is awesome!  I came home to my laundry room flooded and panicked.  Called Aaron and he was out in about an hour.  He was friendly, efficient and had my laundry room back to normal in less than 45 minutes.  The rates are reasonable as well, not what I expected for emergency service. Also, two week guarantee, first time that has ever been offered right away.   He will be the plumber I call from now on.

Thanks for the $7 bowl of chicken soup without a shred of chicken in it. Do you always do that to takeout orders since there is no way to complain in person or get what we actually paid for.

Went to this location today and the service was wonderful. Friendly, talkative staff and a great drink. I'll definitely be back, even though it's out of the way for me.

What a wonderful place!  I have been here multiple times and it just keeps getting better! Carlo and Emilie are so friendly and take the time to talk to you, make suggestions, and make sure you are happy with your meal. It is always packed, but the service is always fast and friendly. The butternut squash ravioli is delicious and Carlo's scratch made sausage is the best I've had in Arizona. The patio is beautiful and it is dog friendly which is great. The desserts, freshly baked bread, and selection of meats and cheeses are the best in the area!

I was excited to try this truck last night in Gilbert. Asked the window dude what he preferred between two dishes. He recommended a completely different dish, so I figured it must be good and went with his suggestion. The pork dumplings (forget the real name) tasted great, I actually told a few people to get some they were that good. Now I wish I hadn't.  Sorry guys! Thank you Bang Bang Dumplings for the food poisoning and awful night.

I had heard some great things about this place, and since it is super close I thought I'd try it out for a mid week breakfast.  Unfortunately I don't have anything good to report.  It took a good 5 minutes for anyone to appear in the dining room/ entrance to notice that a customer came in, so I was standing at the empty hostess stand contemplating leaving right then.  Wish I had.  The one waitress in the place was nice enough, but called me a term of endearment which was not appreciated coming from a teenager.  I ended up paying about $3 for one and a half tiny cups of coffee because nobody offered to refill it or come close enough to refill it.  Someone who I'm guessing was the manager came over, pot in hand, and asked me how my meal was and promptly walked away without asking to fill the coffee.  I had to call him back to ask.  Unfortunately by that time I was basically done with my meal.  And by done with my meal I mean done trying to eat what was served.  I guess the kitchen ran out of salt, because even my corned beef and hash was bland.  Potatoes had absolutely no seasoning on them either.  The eggs came under cooked for what I asked as well.  The place is also horribly over priced for what it was.  I got the 'American Breakfast" 2 eggs, a meat, a carb, and a potato. was $10 or more, coffee was $2.50ish, and orange juice as $3 something.  All together my meal was over $17 for a breakfast and service that will make sure I will never return.  Pretty sure I can get the same breakfast at Postino's for cheaper.
