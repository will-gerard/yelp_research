Long story short, DO NOT LIVE HERE:  4 reasons why:  Parking: Rarely will you find a parking spot. Many times I have to park across the street at the Target parking lot and walk across. If I'm lucky I'll find a spot on the opposite side of the complex.  Only one main entrance: So if it's after office hours you can only enter the complex through the main gate. So if you work north east from this complex(which is unlikely since that is a canal and mostly an shrubs) expect to only enter through the main gate.  Maintenance: Our water is constantly being shut off. One time with 15 min warning. There was a time when the water was off overnight so we Weren't able to shower before bed, brush our teeth, use the toilet, etc.  I'm assuming the problem with the water is going to be a constant problem due to the age of the complex.   Towing: Unknown to me, if you don't update your registration on your tags immediately your car will be towed at your expense by their partners at quick towing.   Hidden fees: a couple months into our lease we started getting this mysterious 38 dollar fee included in our rent charge. We received a notice of the break down... Turns out it's for water and trash; however, we were never informed of this charge upon signing our lease and why wasn't it in effect the first couple of months?

My boyfriend and I actually checked this place out to have a drink while we waited on a table for another restaurant. The bartender was so attentive and polite that we actually just decided to eat there at the full service bar. As soon as my drink was empty, he was there to offer another. Same with our dinner plates. I had the pot pie and drank sangria- both were amazing!!

Love this place! My spray tan was a nice deep brown, not orange whatsoever which I've had more times than I'd like. It also lasted longer than any other spray tan I've gotten. And you can't beat a free drink!

Worst place ever. To start, we had like 3 different waiters... We had no idea who our actual waiter was which caused confusion and mix ups with both our food and drink orders. Our wine flight was forgotten about so I lost my buzz from my initial drink before the flight came. And speaking of the first drink...I'm a sangria fanatic, but this sangria tasted bitter and was not enjoyable in the slightest. The bruschetta was a rip off and the "sides" for the sandwiches (tomato soup) came in a tiny condiments dish. My boyfriend felt so sick after leaving this place and was sick for part of the next day. Never ever coming here again.

Such a great experience. Everything was so yummy and the portions were great. My boyfriend has a big appetite so we often like places but the only problem is is my boyfriend still leaves hungry.... Not with this place. We ordered food and kind of shared everything and not one of the things we ordered was not not good. I had the biscuits and gravy and parfait and he had the smoked salmon hash with the Bloody Mary. Speaking of, they have a build your own Bloody Mary bar which was amazing. They had like 4 different kinds of beef jerky alone to choose from. Loving beef jerky it instantly had my approval. We will definitely return!
