Thumbs up! Great delivery choice. Crab wontons are the ticket! Best broccoli beef I have ever had. Happy and stuffed.

Just called in an order to pick up, I had a terrible experience! The hostess was rude, order incomplete, wings cold and undercooked. I asked for Parmesan cheese and red pepper, the hostess I believe her name was Jessica told me no, that she did not have time. I just had to reheat everything! Not a happy customer! And I paid $60, should have done delivery!
