I love this place... Their wings are huge and the pizza is delicious. I have eaten there a few times and I have never had a bad meal. They do take out and you can call ahead and order to pick it up or they can deliver it up to 2 miles. The store is kinda hard to find but once you find it, you will back again, I promise.

I think I found a new barber shop... I loved this place. I went in for a straight razor shave and only had to wait for a few minutes to get into a chair. When I got into the chair, the barber asked tons of questions to make sure she knew what I wanted. I know a lot of people dont like spending a lot of time in the chair, but with a shave I'm fine with spending an hour or so in the chair. I also have really sensitive skin and I told her that and she made sure that she took a little extra time. They use hot towels and a great warm shaving cream that has a nice cooling effect. It was a great shave and she made sure that it was lined up and perfect before I got out of the chair. I will defiantly go back for my haircut. Prices are good to... $16 for a shave and $13 for a haircut....

First off this Allison girl has no idea how to make a bowl... and also has no idea what goes on at a Mongolian Grill. At this grill the menu is not needed... it only shows you what deserts they offer and different drinks. And how do you rate this 2 STARS... you pick what YOU want eat!!!   When walk to the line, make sure you get enough meat to satisfy your tastes. I particularly like the sliced beef and the marinated steak. When you get to the vegetables make sure that you push them down into your bowl. The more you press it down the more room you have. Once again, I don't know where Allison has been to eat but normally you give your bowl to the person that cooks it and they give it back on a plate. Allison must eat like a champ, eats wayyyy to much or she is just dumb. You DO NOT NEED TO GET A BOTTOMLESS BOWL.... Press everything down and you will be full after you are done eating... ALLISON!!!! You rated your bowl 2 stars and you have no idea what you were doing... go back and make another bowl the right way and I promise you will like it better.

I still love this place but I feel everything is always wet. The clean bowls are wet. The trays are wet. The floor. It's just strange to me. Quality is still good and food tastes great. Make what you like and like what you eat.

Sooooooo slow. They do not process a line very fast and most of the time they mess up the order in the simplest of ways. When I've gone inside the employees seem flustered and not in a groove you would expect morning employees to be. Hope they figure it out.
