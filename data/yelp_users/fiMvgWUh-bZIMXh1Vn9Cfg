Great little hidden local spot.  I arrived before my breakfast date and the server got my ready with coffee and the menu.  My coffee cup was never empty.  This is a huge plus in my breakfast world.  I ordered with breakfast sandwich with bacon substituted for the ham and hash browns extra crispy.  This was such a simple comfort food breakfast that I could have easily cooked for myself at home, but instead the staff here made it for me and it was even better. This is truly a tiny little place with as many tables as possible pushed in there.  So if you don't like seeing what your neighbor is eating, you might try someplace else.  I personally loved making conversation about what they ordered for breakfast. Love 40th Street Cafe and can't wait to try it for lunch.

This location of Lowe's home improvement is usually my go to stop for all of my home needs. However, this time, Joel in the kitchen project center and his attitude of indifference really made me not want to do my project through them. I wanted to install new kitchen counters. I had the product picked out. I had the sample. The website said that Lowe's was an authorized distributor and installer. Joel acted with disdain about the product and how much more expensive it is than to comparable products they carry.  I was not opposed to looking at other products, so I started looking at the granite and asked him some questions. Did he answer them? Yes. However, his condescending tone truly irritated me. I went in to this Lowe's with the intention of closing the sale and getting my new countertops from them. I did not have all the information necessary which is why I wanted someone to come out and give me the estimate, understanding fully that they are not free. It will be quite a while before I attempt to give this Lowe's my business again.

The food is decent, however one of our dishes came to the table fairly cold. The other two dishes were nice and hot. The server was horrible. She simply stood there and asked if we were ready yet. No suggestions, even when asked. The sangria tasted like koolaid, and the bar drinks were so weak and watered down that my drink was sent back and I couldn't even drink the final version. I just gave up. It was a two ingredient drink, not something complicated. Anyway, I had a person who appeared to be the manager argue with me about my drink. I will not be going back and will tell my friends not to bother.  Oh, and the server had to add our bill up twice and it took at least 20 minutes to charge us. We could see her from our table and she was truly clueless as to how to put the amount on the cards.

I went here today for the first time with about 15 co-workers.  I'm sure they were not expecting that many people on a random Tuesday during the lunch hour, but that is no excuse for unorganized, slow service.    So, the idea here is you fill out a form to place your order (and put your name on it), and it becomes the paper bag that holds your completed sandwich.  They put the order up on a wire and push it on down the line as they put it together.  Simple system that keeps the orders in order and you pick up your sandwich when they call you name.  Yet, my very simple turkey sandwich wasn't ready until after 5 other people's sandwiches who ordered after me.  How do you screw that up?  Another of my co-workers had the same thing happen with his order.  And their sandwiches were just as basic as mine and his.  Then, as I said, I ordered a turkey sandwich, however, I truly had to take apart my sandwich to see if there was any turkey on it.  There was, but it was so minimal, I might as well have ordered the vegetarian option.    My new job is within walking distance of this Which Wich, and I will not be going here again.

This is such a fun way to dine! The element of unknown with each course appeals to my foodie adventurous nature. They start off with a "menu" that determines what you will or won't eat. Then the chef prepares your food courses and and server brings the dishes to you with an explanation of what you are going to be eating. They are very proactive in ensuring that you enjoy the dishes. My friend set aside a portion of one of the courses for me to try and our sever immediately came over to check that the dish was satisfactory.   I can't wait to dine here again.

Love the laid back, fun vibe Dutch Bros. always has while serving great drinks. Always get a smile when I drive thru and the baristas have a great time at work and they share the positive atmosphere. The drinks are consistently delicious and they never hesitate when I order a less-than-simple drink.

Now, to be fair, I will disclose that I have not eaten at a McDonald's in probably 5 or more years. However,  I thought that when you order a cheeseburger, it actually came with a burger.  Imagine my surprise after ordering 2 of these extremely special items at this drive thru at 1:00 in the afternoon and opening it up when I got to my destination and literally there was no burger!  Where's the beef? That phrase has a whole new meaning.

I went to Tryst Cafe to meet a friend for breakfast.  I ordered the Breakfast Burrito and my friend ordered two scrambled eggs and toast.  The food took about 30 minutes to be served, which seemed a little long for breakfast.  My burrito was just ok.  The chorizo was extremely greasy (dripping down my hand as I bit into the burrito).  The side of roasted potatoes was flavorful, although a little cold and the avocado was brown on the edges.   The server asked if we wanted hot sauce or ketchup, to which my friend asked for the hot sauce.  She ate half of her scrambled eggs before he returned.  Then she had to ask for jam for her toast.  Overall, Tryst was just ok.  I really have no inclination to return.
