This place is so bomb!!!! But surprisingly there is never any people inside eating? Maybe I'm not coming during the rush but I'm not complaining at all.   There baja fish tacos are like crack to me. SO GOOD!! There chips are addicting. Just the right amount of salt to go with there even better tasting salsa bar

If it wasn't for the bums outside the store EVERY time i go in there it would be a lil better. but seriously. come on! there goes not one day i find a bum asking me for a dollar or some change. I'm sorry i work to hard for my money to just hand it over to you to go buy a tall can.   i avoid this place at all cost unless there is nothing else in the area. (walmart on thomas and 36th st but thats in a different review lol)   do something about the bums and ill consider coming back to your store

It's so funny reading all the reviews about del taco because...well IT'S DEL TACO! I'm stationed down in sierra vista where we only have taco bell....which SUCKS!!!!! and if any of you reading this knows where that is, no need to feel sorry for this guy because I will be moving up here in a few months. Literally everytime I visit Phoenix i stop at this del taco because it's close to where I stay. There food really must have crack in it because I can't stay away from this place everytime I come up.  Del taco in general is always clean. The staff is kinda slow at this one but it's Sunday and everyone is at brunch/church whatever lol.  All in all thank god for del taco, and there delicious big fat chicken tacos!!

i came here the first time when i first moved to the Biltmore and was stoked i had one of these next to my place.   i got the impression from the people that work there that I'm at a car dealership. lol they try and upsell you everything they can think of. NO SIR i just want my car washed. i needed up falling for it and ended up paying $100 to have my car detailed. and to be honest it wasn't worth. yes my car came out clean but not what i was expecting for dropping $100 bucks! they left water spots, they DID NOT vacuum my truck. i had to tell them to when i looked at my car, so just inspect your ride before you hand the dude a nice lil tip. there is a guy that works in the auto service department and he hooks me up whenever i want to get my car serviced and throughs in free car washes every time i go there, which i can't complain. but get it together guys! you have high end cars getting washed there day after day. you would think it would be a little better in a area like this.

I don't know why I stopped here for lunch This afternoon. But I do know that I will never eat at a whataburger EVER again!  This place has some of the most off the wall people working the cash register! This chick took my order; Then dosed off into a trance like stare at my "yoohoo" area... And NO I didn't have anything going on down there or nothing on my pants if that's what your thinking. Seriously though no joke I couldn't believe  what this chick was doing in front of the entire lunch hour rush that was storming in and out...  I looked at her then politely said "umm hello? Miss, What are you looking at?" she came out of her spell and smiled at me with a kinda creepy half smile... Then as I was filling up my drink I caught her doing it AGAIN!  NO I'm not gay and yes I do have standards. This chick was missing half her teeth and was about as old as bob barker.  Yeah I literally couldn't even eat cause this chick made me loose my appetite. And the fact that my burger and fries tasted like it was soaked in a bowl of grease then sat under a heat lamp for about 20 minutes.   They should shut this place down or turn it into a In N Out burger. NEVER AGAIN!

Ok all you people that bitch and complain about fees at a venue is stupid. You go to a concert right? EXPECT to pay fees! If not then happy day for you :)  That's how the venue makes there $$ IE drinks, parking and so forth. Parking was $5 BTW  Alright now on to the review. This place is sick!!!! Loved the setup. We went to see Bassnectar here last week. SOLD OUT show and I kid you not you could still go to the bathroom without waiting 10 minutes. Drinks are reasonable, $6 beers or $6 well rum & cokes. Not to shabby then going to let's say a Dimondbacks game and paying $10 for a 8oz cup of beer. Also love the smoking area out behind the bar were you can get whatever  kind of cigarettes you want.  Security was a lil tight. If your gonna bring drugs to a event then be smart people. Come on really!! Saw at least 4 guys get taken out an hour before the show started for dealing RIGHT IN FRONT of security. o.0 no sympathy at all.   Place is a little run down on the inside. Could use a little up keep but seriously who goes there for how nice the paint is on the walls haha?!   All in all. Will defiantly come see another show here

This place is so good!  This is a prefect place for a first date. Great atmosphere, friendly bartenders with decent priced drinks. Had the marinara something pasta lol I forgot what it was called but it was bomb! Great location in central Phoenix next to the light rail.

Living down in Sierra vista 2 years killed me knowing that there is a few yard houses couple hundred miles north.   They have the BOMBEST onion rings than any other place I've been to! I think there batter is laced with crack. I can eat a entire tower by myself there that good. Though I wouldn't recommend it since your stomach won't like you if you start pounding down all that beer they have with it.  Food there is on the high side but it's worth it. Havnt ordered anything that didn't taste like it came out of a freezer bag. You wont be disappointed.   Every time I come here I always start with there sampler pack which consists of 6 beers they choose for the month. Your bound to find something that you will like.   Seriously don't come here and order a bud light or a corona. I mean really im sure there are people that just won't try anything new but really though... There will be something you will love just as much if not even better than your pre existing favorite.   There is usually a tall guy with a beard working the bar every time I come here. He has been here since it opened ad he will find something to quench your thirst :)  If your like me and have a few to many of those half yards and feel like you may have had a few to much. Dont be a dummy and drive off so the scottsdale PD can give you a DUI. Big no no! then just go walk it off in the fashion square mall.

I am a complete idiot for going to Mill Ave for 2 years off and on driving up from bum town Sierra Vista to party at mill. first time going to this place and wow i was hooked the first 5 minutes of being there. the musicians they have performing there are AWESOME!!! pick a song out of your head and 98% of the time they will know it and if its something you really wanna play them slap down a few extra bucks. multiple bars and tubs with beer in it so almost no problem getting a drink.   all in all 5 stars. by far my favorite place on mill ave

Just moving to Phoenix a week ago I didn't have any idea this was a dine in theater. I walked in and was asked for my ID. I was like "ummm sure" the ticket dude told me what this place was an my jaw dropped literally!  We sat in the cinema suites which all the seats are lazy boy recliner chairs! You can order anything on there dinner menu plus get any type of alcoholic beverage you desire while in the movie theater...  Will Definatly go back since I live right down the street but this is not the type of movie theater that I will go every time a decent movie comes out.

Sushi here is off the hook! Seriously pick some up next time your here. Pretty decent for a grocery store.   Store is kept very clean but this place can get busy busy busy at night and on weekends. Stay away from buying your booze here. Way to expensive! Go down the street to total wine!   I wish they had a albertsons like in California. That is the best place to buy groceries! This isnt that bad though :)

Frst off i will say once again THANK YOU YELP! For helping me find this diamond in the rough.  I would give this place 6 stars if it would let me! I was hooked after my first bite of my jumbo dog. Juicy fresh and full of flavor!   I was a little skeptical when I saw what the place looked like and the no decor in the dining area but really are you thereto judge how nice the windows look or how much you dislike the paint job. You go for the food!  The fries... Where to start on the fries. Wow Blew me away! By far the best French fries I've had since moving to Phoenix. Will defiantly be a regular eater at this place.

Just moved to the bit more area not to long ago. This is the closest Wally world to my place and I'm seriously debating wether or not I should ever shop here again.  Wtf? Is with the parking lot? It seriously looks like waste managements district dumping headquarters. I managed to navigate around the heap of trash everywhere but nope; ended up stepping on a used condom rapper soon as I stepped foot out of my car. Makes me sick. Thinking about it now.  As for the store, the people working there are honestly rather nice and polite, but you know you can see right through those fake smiles with "I hate my job" or "FML"  I usually just shop there for alcohol since it really is the cheapest place to buy other than a Rite Aid which I don't think We have any but I could be wrong. Ended up taking a person 10 minutes just to open up the liquor cabinet then to be told it will be at register 16 which is the one of 2 MAYBE 3 open at all times. Horrible!  Never seen a super Wally world that has so little open at any given time. This place looks like you where living in south Phoenix which  I wouldn't doubt would be any better but I think I'll take my chances and just shop at target.

Outstanding customer service! To top it with bomb food! Seriously I wish they had more of these in the valley.  This place reminds me of fuddruckers. If you havnt tried one of there burgers then you are missing out! this place is addicting!  You will eat here and wonder why you still eat at burger king or jack in the box. This place puts them to shame!

My local hang out spot when there nothing else decent going on in town.   Almost always have live bands playing all sorts of rock. Never really know what you will hear when you get there. The bartenders are super chill and always know what I want to drink soon as I walk in . Prices are fairly cheap for this part of Phoenix. Huge plus being I live right up the street.   Do not drink & drive in this area I must tell you cops drive up and down Indian school and 24th st. So just giving a heads up.

The west coast has In N Out; & the east has five guys. It's pretty damn close to the quality and taste of In N Out. in comparison I would say that they have some of the best fries ive had at a fast food chain.  What caught my eyes first was that you can put ANYTHING on your hot dog or burger! My friend looked at me all weirded out that I got a hot dog with A1 sauce on it. Lol Everyone has there little special way of eating things and this is the place I can literally put anything on my burger. Big plus for five guys.  It does suck that it's only in the food court in fashion square. :/

This place sucks balls. I can't believe it is still open. I went here one day while I was installing a alarm system in a house around the area. Took them 45 min to bring out 2 slices of pizza by that point i was going to walk out the door.   blandest pizza i have ever tasted. i don't know how this place is still open. never again. horrible service, horrible food.

WOW!  i had no idea what the hype was about this place until one day i got off work early and saw a Five Guys on the way home from work. BOMBDIZZLE!  the fries are like a orgasm in my mouth. and they give you SOOO much! lol they give you almost a entire bag full to the brim of fries. burger was tasty and juicy, bacon was nice and crispy just the way i like it. i am defiantly a fan! its like a bother in n out burger just a lil different. but in a good way. they finally opened one up in central phoenix! check this joint out you won't be dissapointed.
