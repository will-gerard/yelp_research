I selected North Mountain Dentisty based on these reviews.  When I called to make an appointment, I was equally impressed.  Today, I arrived at 2:40 for my appointment, with my paperwork completed.  I waited 30 minutes before I was informed that the receptionist was going to call my insurance to verify my copays, etc.  I have a new insurance card and when I called to make my appointment, the same receptionist said everything would be verified in advance. When I kindly inquired why this wasn't done in advance, she rudely said "I'm only one person and have other patients to serve as well."   Normally, I would expect a small wait for any medical appointment and admittingly I was  impressed by the letter I received in the mail prior to coming in reinforcing that first impressions mean everything to them.  I was so disappointed and frustrated by the lack of timely customer service, that I chose to leave.  Perhaps it was a busy day there, which I understand as well, but I didn't appreciate the poor customer service or lack of appreciation for my time.

WOW, perfect evening!  From the impeccable customer service and cozy atmosphere to the amazing food, it was certainly an unforgettable experience!  It's been three days since I've been there, and yet I can't stop thinking about the mouth-watering decadence...melt-in-your-mouth foie gras with fig....peanut butter cr√®me brulee with fresh berries.  A little slice of heaven!

New owners, Trish and Mong, have done a fantastic job remodeling the salon!!! They've taken great care to create a modern, clean and welcoming ambiance. Enjoyed a great mani and pedi!

Terrible experience with Dr Lersch and referral specialist. First time visit with Dr Lersch for 11 year old check up was okay. Everything since then, including spending hours on the phone following up on a referral, false promises to send to referral dr.s and finally a decision Dr Lersch would not support a referral to a speech therapist even though he diagnosed him as tongue tied. What a run around!

Disappointed. Extremely disappointed. Long waits. Too many people. Unorganized. 40 minutes between games made to an uneventful experience.

Serious, the service and food are both by far the best in central phx.  It's really the people that make this place one of our favorites. Kudos to the staff for never making me transfer my bar tab, for letting me enjoy your great happy hour until our fav booth becomes available and just being good peeps. You never let is down!  Ps, you're everything The Yard should be! Xoxo!

Gosh, we love this place but not at this location. Slow service and terrible food. We nearly missed our flight to bring breakfast on board. The burrito was filled primarily with potatoes. I don't mind spending money at the airport for a good drink and grub, but our $60 dollar tab was a huge disappointment.

Great food. Memorable and delish drinks, but most impressive is the service. Best in town, hands down.

Love this place!! Great service, impressive food and amazing beer! Highly recommend the wings and the Easy Amber Ale!  The Pulled Pork and Mosaic American Pale Ale was the top ranking for my husband. And our kids loved everything, but especially the complimentary Popsicles!

Excellent food and incredible service! The street tacos were phenomenal. The happy hour was impressive. The family who  operates Escobar make it a memorable experience!
