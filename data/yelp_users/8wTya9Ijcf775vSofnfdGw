I first found Desert Song about a year ago when I was searching for an intro class.    I took the three session intro for 75 bucks.  Taught by Heidi Leiche, the intro class was full of yoga history as well as practice.  When you learn a bit about purpose behind a pose, rather than just how to do the pose, you get the full benefit of the practice. Heidi is especially easy to talk to and never makes you feel silly or stupid.  All of the other instructors are good as well. I try and get in a class twice a month here.  Not pretentious, very friendly.  Good for all ages and body types.  I highly recommend this center!

I'm gonna agree with Stevey P. You can find better mexican food elsewhere.  Is it terrible? No, but it isn't something to write home about.   The service was adequate, but they did get one of my party's order incorrect.  He did get his plate replaced rather quickly, but it was a simple red/green burrito mix-up.  The hostess/waitress's breath was KICKIN!  IT was a serious problem!  They have a giant bowl of mints by the door, I really wish she had taken full advantage of that.  And while her service was attentive, she brought drinks out like no body's business, we really didn't want her coming to our table.  It was really bad.  I would probably not come here again.

I wandered in here for the first time last week.  I liked it so much I went twice more in the same week!  I met Gina Madrid, the owner, and we bonded over growing up in West Phoenix.  She was so nice and easygoing, it felt more like chatting with an old friend rather than buying an americano and cupcake.  I almost forgot to pay, and she almost forgot to charge me!  Speaking of the cupcakes:  they are deeeelicous and vegan.  I had the PB & J cupcake and it was like heaven.  Moist, creamy, and sweet all at the same time.  She said that the guy who bakes them just walked in one day and offered to let her try some of his wares.  He used to bake them at his house, but Gina liked them so much she offered to let him use her kitchen at the Lounge.  They are really really good.   I like the minimalist decor and the fact that Gina doesn't want to display art.  Normally I would hate this, but Gina makes a great argument for having a nice blank space to clear your thoughts. Plus it can be a hassle to manage the selling of art and finding artisits that you want to sell for.   The music is awesome!  Classic rock, rockabilly, 70's and 80's easy listening.  Ya gotta love some "Leather and Lace" with your vegetable fritatta in the morning!

I love this bar. It has a calm atmosphere that is great for a first date scenario or meeting someone for a cozy chat.  It is rather small and can get pretty packed on busy nights though.  I recommend getting there early and securing a seat.  The first time I was there about a year ago, I met Ernie the owner. She was so pleasant and friendly!  Now every time I go in she welcomes me by name and gives me a hug!  Good people!  Great place to meet a friend and have a brew.

I lived at DJ's for the entirety of 2005. Seriously.  I was there everyday.  Doc and Mikey are great guys, as are all the other servers.   They make the drinks strong here. One or two will knock you on your ass. Ask Mikey for "that purple thing" he makes. We called it a 'Grimace'.  It is a good place to meet someone at 1:45 AM.  Once I was there right before they had to 'bomb" the place for roaches, (don't worry they covered all the glasses with a plastic tarp.)   This is not a place to take a date. This is not a place to grab a bite to eat. You cannot have an intimate conversation. This is a place to get drunk and make out in the ladies room.

I see rox every chance I get.  I just wish my hair grew faster!  Seriously though, she is awesome. About a year and a half ago, she transformed my luscious long locks into an adorable bob.  Immediately everyone wanted to know where I got my hair done.  It was a perfect cut for my face.  Now that I'm growing it out, I'm ready for her to transform it into a cute medium length 'do.    Everyone at the root is nice and welcoming.  They always have a cold bottle of beer/water for you as your waiting.  I would recommend this salon to everyone who wants hip/cool hair.  (she is also a fantastic colorist!)

OH Dos Hippies....how I wanted to love you sooo much.    I'd been passing this place by due to the long lines around noon, and just biding my time until I too would get to taste the deliciousness.  I should have waited longer.....  I went in on a Friday around 4:30 and there was no line!  I was so excited!  I perused the simple menu and was delighted to find "Cactus Tacos".  This is something I grew up eating, we called it 'nopales', and I'd never seen it on a taco menu.  So I ordered two Cactus Tacos with no cheese.  The very nice chick behind the counter said that the Cactus was prepared fresh daily and mixed with feta cheese.  Okay, I'm not lactose intolarant, just watching calories, so I said that would be fine, just no extra cheese.  She suggested I get three tacos, but I stuck with two, glad I did.  I then paid $1.00 for a can of diet pepsi. $1.00!!!? Get fountain drinks, please.  I waited less than 3 minutes to pick up my tacos from the patio window in the back and sat down amongst a bunch of happily chewing people.  I was excited!  The size of the tacos was great!  I was really happy I only got two, b/c I wouldn't be able to fit in three. I also noticed that there was shredded cheddar on them, even though I'd asked for no extra cheese.  I took off as much as I could and didn't think much about it.  As I picked up the first taco, I thought, 'wow, these seem cold...omg, these *are* cold.'  Who eats cold tacos?  The nopales (prickly pear cactus) were ice cold. ice cold.  The flour tortillas were also cold, the only thing that wasn't cold were the lukewarm pinto beans.  Okay.. I'm half-mexican and will eat a lot of things in a tortilla, almost anything, but I have never been served cold nopales.  Okay, I decided to give it a try, because I'm willing to try anything once. The first bite was crunchy and my intial thought was "holy crap they didn't clean the cactus of needles!"  then I realized the crunchiness was merely from the *partially-cooked* rice that was in the taco.  I opened up both tacos, scooped the uncooked rice out and finished them.   I wanted to like this place so badly!  Why, oh why couldn't you have been amazing?!  I may be too forgiving, but I'm willing to go back and try one of their hot dogs....but give me some time......

First, let me say that I am a huge fan of Dr. Andrew Weil.  He is an advocate of eating whole, natural and organic foods whenever possible.  He doesn't have a 'diet' book, but he does advocate for eating in a way that our bodies our truly nourished.  I was soo excited to find out about True Food Kitchen.  I found the decor to be light and festive.  My dad found the colors reminded him of the 70's. lol. Our waiter was really nice and took the time to explain all of the teas available to my mom. He suggested we try the hummus, and since I'm a sucker for chickpeas, we ordered it. I'm totally going to start making my hummus with some jalepeno!  It was great, but a tad spicy for some.  We loved it.  I had the steak tacos with adzuki beans.  The beans were quite spicy and I only ate half, but they were delicious. The tacos were great and I could tell the meat was "organic" (duh, of course meat is organic people!) because of the distinct taste of meat not raised with added hormones.    One plus about this place is that people who have allergies to certain food products are absolutely able to eat here.  There are plenty of vegan, vegetarian, and dairy-free items on the menu. I will definitely be back.  My only problem is that I found it to be a bit expensive, but then again, I'm cheap. lol.  Plus:  I saw some dogs seated with owners at their side patio tables!

This place was sooo yummy!   Very clean, nice employees.    I really wish we had Pinkberry here in PHX, but in many ways this is better.  At least 10 different flavors of yogurt to choose from.  I tried their green tea, but didn't like it as much as Pink's.  But they did have a DELICIOUS "taro" flavor that I think I like even better.  I could eat a ton of it.  There were also many many delicious toppings to choose from.  I"m kind of boring and just like the fresh fruit and nuts, but there are also sprinkles and cheesecake bits.   This is a really great place to go for a date, b/c it is so cheap and intimate.
