I was on a business trip this week and decided to venture to Boa twice. The first night was great, hence the "twice" part!  They had a nice happy hour menu as soon as we got in with different bruschetta and seafood apps. For an entr√©e, I had the kale salad with the egg. If the egg had not been on there, the salad would have been slightly boring. But my co-worker, who has lived in Italy before, opted on the Coniglio pasta and said it was one of the nest pastas he had ever had!   The second night good, but not as great as the first night. I chose the Cali love salad this time, chicken was a little dry and skimpy on the avocado, dressing was delicious though so that helped. Another great veal pasta for my co-worker (I think that obviously the pastas are their thing!)   Both nights the service was good, and the atmosphere is really nice! Outside was good, but inside is dimply lit, romantic with dark wood and rustic touches.   The one thing though that I absolutely hated: the music! What in the hell!? Here you are at this trendy spot and some dub step song comes on with rap in it? I would strongly advise someone to change this. Other than that: awesome!

We stopped by here on our way to Sedona after being in the car for quite some time, and I am glad we did because it was a very refreshing experience. Our server was so nice and efficient that I felt like I was the only table that she was waiting on. I had a salad which was a nice portion size and fresh, and my friend had one of the skillet plates which seemed hearty and well prepared. I am glad that we were able to sit outside on the nice patio, they closed the windows so the only light on the inside was artificial; that would be the only recommendation I would make. Too bad I do not live closer or else I would have been back again!

Nothing about my experience here was pleasant, sorry.   We came into a little bit of chaos trying to find a seat, even though there were not too many people sitting for dinner service yet. I ordered a well drink because of the happy hour menu- the ratio of liquor to water was very weak. I then ordered the not-so original chopped salad- try not-so-good. The arugula was good, but there was a disproportionate amount of the other ingredients- almost like they just opened a bunch of cans of raisins and corn and put it on the plate.   The service was slow; I feel like everyone else was interested in the tables that had about 15 young girls taking shots than the people ordering dinner. Also, I don't know if it is just because I am from California but I do not appreciate people smoking a few feet away from me while I am eating my food.   I was hoping I was coming to a nice brewery-inspired restaurant, not just a bar.
