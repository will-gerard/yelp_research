Darryl the really tall manager, he's the best! I will comeback only because of his service and the attention to details. Cheap drinks and tacos... The pizzas are good but the tacos are amazing! Try the potato ones...

Their beef pho is very tasty and also their spring rolls. Very clean and excellent service, definitively one of my favorite places to eat in the area.

I'm giving one star because I still like the Pizza. But in customer service they have no idea. Only because of that I am not calling this place again and instead I went to another pizza place by Scottsdale road which is an Italian family owned restaurant , it was amazing! ..Its called Lo cascio... I called this place last night and after one hour waiting for my pizza I called and they said that they tried to call me (lie) and that it went directly to voicemail (lame) and they didn't leave a message?? Because they had the wrong address (lie again) ... So I said you know what you better not bring me that cold pizza, you need to make a new one, that girls was so rude and she said I will hook you up?? After another 30 min The driver called back, saying if I could please give them AGAIN my credit card number (to the driver???) because they had the wrong number.! I said are you still at the shop? He said yes... It was already two hours late! I said to the driver please let me talk to the girl, I asked her what's happening? She said don't worry I am sending you an extra 2 liter soda!! Haha please! I then decided I didn't want that pizza anymore! And she only responded ok bye. Do not waste your money here when you can get a better quality in pizza and customer service down the street... I am never calling back to this place... Ever!

Someone recommended this place and they were right. This is real Mexican food right in the middle of Scottsdale. We ordered the tilapia chicharron and the Tampiquena...they were both really good, the meat was tasty and juicy. The salsas and chips that they serve you in the beginning are to die for! ..great service and great environment. I went to get lunch but they told me that at night they have a DJ, we are coming back for sure!

OMG, I'm so glad I am not the only one that had the most terrible service with this company. They are so rude and unprofessional. I was in one of their estate sale and when I wanted to pay for 2 purses I found, I asked her if she would take ONE dollar off the purchase, she I guess Kathy, responded in the most discourteous behavior : "NO, And I am not even adding taxes with that" ....Are you kidding me? By the way all the items were way overpriced!!!. Do not hire these people they have the worst manners I've ever seen in a estate sale or a garage sale. Just like the other review, I won't be attending to any of their sales again.  EVER.

I'm disappointed of this place!. We visited this bar last night because we wanted to see the UFC pay per view fight. We sat by the bar and we received a good service from the bartenders but OMG the food!, My boyfriend order a cheeseburger and it was OK (not the price though) but my Hot dog (Tijuana Torpedo) right, was Horrible! Cold bread, bacon was overcooked and cold, not enough onions I just didn't like it at all! Do not order this!..I may comeback only for drinks but the food in my opinion it was overpriced and bad. The patio is nice.

I ordered the tinga quesadilla: not impressed at all!!! Avoid this! Just order regular drinks. I do not recommend the Chelada drinks either! It tasted like watery beer. In the beginning they served the beer and they didn't tell us that they were out of  tecate beers, so they decided to serve the Chelada (that goes with tecate beer) with dos Equis. I noticed when the bartender was serving the beer and asked her, then she had to agree with me. Sneaky bartender!!!! Check your drinks specially if you order the good ones!

I waited so long to visit this place I finally did last night and had a terrible experience with our drinks and service. Bartenders think they own the place, sour experience with them and their attitude, drinks were returned twice we left after 30 minutes. I didn't have any food but We do not think  we will be back with that customer service & quality of drinks..

I loved the food and service. Hostess was not aware that she gave us a booth with no server available. When we asked if we could sit in the patio she said it was not open yet ( tables were set??) we decided then to sit in a booth by the bar but no one came to the table until we asked for a server. Once the server came he was amazing and gave us a great service. We loved the food and the ambiance.
