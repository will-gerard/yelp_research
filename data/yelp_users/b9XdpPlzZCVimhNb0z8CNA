"The Old Spaghetti Factory" was probably one of the first restaurants my wife and I ate at when we started dating.  Money was tight back then and TOSF soon became one of our favorite eats.  I hate to compare this place to a fast food restaurant, but this place is like the "McDonald's" of Italian food.  Now let me explain that.  When you go to McDonald's, it doesn't matter where in the country, or in the world, you are, when you order a cheeseburger, you know what you are going to get.  It's consistent and it's inexpensive.  The same can be said for TOSF.   It's decent quality Italian food, at very fair prices.    I've sampled many things on the menu over the years, but lately I always get the same thing when we go out for dinner; Spaghetti and Meatballs.  I know most people wouldn't think to order something that you can make at home out, but I like a good meat sauce and my wife would rather have marinara.  So, for me, it's a treat.  She adores the spaghetti with mizithra cheese and brown butter, although, last night she ordered the meatloaf and said she found a new favorite dish.  I'll have to try it next time.  I'm usually the one that goes for the "soul food".  Dinner is usually served with a salad, and their creamy pesto dressing (similar to a ranch) is really amazing.  Remember to save a little room for desert, because you always get your choice of a scoop of ice cream, spumoni, or sherbet afterwards.  TOSF is definitely kid friendly.  It is a true family restaurant.  The trolley car in the middle of the restaurant is always a draw with the little ones.  There can be a wait sometimes.  Call ahead and put your name on the list, since they don't take reservations.  The 1980's era arcade games are great to pass the time and bring back many memories of wasted quarters of my youth.  TOSF is one of those places that will always leave you full of good food and great memories...even if it is a chain.

I've been going to A & D Barber for about a year now.  I have to say they are the best barbershop I've found since moving to Phoenix in the late 90's.  I don't know what I can say that hasn't already been said about this place.  The barbers are top notch.  Art runs a tight ship.  For $19, you can't beat the cut, hot towel and shoulder massage.  I make it in every 3-4 weeks and rarely have more than a 30-minute wait.  I have nothing but great things to say about this place.  If you're looking for a new barber, then I highly recommend A & D.

We used to live within walking distance of Texaz Grill back in the late 90's.  We pretty much O.D.'ed on the place.  Yeah, it's that good.  What some might call, "A heart attack on a plate", I call "Redneck Paradise" (minus the boots, Bermuda shorts, wife beater tee, and cowboy hat, of course).  Texaz grill serves the best Chicken Fried Steak and Chicken Fried Chicken I've ever had.  Be forewarned though.  If you come, bring your appetite.  If you leave Texaz hungry, it's your own fault.    The portion sizes are more than generous; I think "Obscene" is more accurate.  The mashed potatoes are mashed with the skins on and smothered in thick white gravy, as was my chicken.  The corn niblets are nice and buttery and the chicken was nice and crispy.  My co-workers had the chicken fried steak and the steak was larger than the plate.  You also get a biscuit, although I'd prefer a roll, I just forgot to ask.  The Chicken Fried Steak and Chicken were both $7.00 and the Iced Tea was $2.00.  I feel it's a pretty fair deal for lunch.  The Texas and Arizona memorabilia that adorn the walls and ceiling are fitting for this place.  I remember when you could smoke in restaurants and it was very smokey too.  I'm so glad the smoking ban passed.  I've heard the place can get busy for lunch, so we went early and didn't have any problems finding parking and we were seated right away and served promptly.  Texaz Grill gets 5 stars in my book and I'm sure they'd appreciate it if you left the Bermuda shorts at home and come fully clothed.  Now for that angioplasty...

I have to start out this review by saying I never had Indian food before I ate here, so I didn't feel I could give it a fair review until I tried a few others around town first.  Well, now that I have, I have to say that "Flavors Of India" is the best Indian Food in Phoenix, bar none!  First off, when you walk into an ethnic food restaurant, and the place is filled with people of the same ethnicity, and the place is really quiet because everyone is busy enjoying their food, you know it's a good place to eat.    Is it a bad thing when the host/manager recognizes you when you walk in... and remembers your order?  You'd think we eat there a lot or something.  I've found my favorite dish is the Chicken Tikka Masala, medium spicy and if you like shrimp, the Shrimp Tikka Masala is just as yummy!  We usually order a side of the Paneer Kulcha (unleavened bread stuffed with Indian style cheese), which is wonderful to sop up the extra yummy sauce after you are finished.  Portion sizes don't appear to be too large, but we always have leftovers.  And it's always better the second day too!  The service is top notch, the food is excellent, and the best part of the dining experience is the Bollywood music videos playing on the flat screen!  Dinner and Entertainment all in one!  FTW!!!  I can't wait to go back!

I forgot how much I liked Miracle Mile Deli until quite recently when I realized I've been going there about 3-4 times a month.  In fact, I was astonished to find that I hadn't written a review of the place yet.  So here goes... First off, the food is served cafeteria style.  I know this turns many people off, but if you give the place a chance, I don't think you will be disappointed.  As I said earlier, the food is quite good.  My favorite is "The Straw".  It contains mounds of hot pastrami, melted Swiss, and sauerkraut.  You have your choice of bread and I always choose the onion roll.  If you like corned beef, try "The New Yorker".  It's similar to "The Straw" but with corned beef and coleslaw.  All sandwiches include fries and a pickle spear.  You can add everything from macaroni and cheese to steamed veggies on the side.  A typical lunch will set you back $10-$11, but most people can make 2 meals out of the sandwich.  File this one under my "Best Lunchtime Eats!"

My wife took me to Steamers for my birthday this summer.  We were both let down that we weren't going to be able to take our annual vacation to Maine to see her Dad and eat lots of yummy fresh seafood.  We love lobster bisque, lobster rolls, baked stuffed lobster, and just about lobster anything.  Oh yeah, and baked stuffed shrimp too.  So this was supposed to be our "mini-getaway" since we were homebound for the summer.  We were both a little let down to be honest.  She chose Steamers because their online menu said they had lobster bisque.  Well, we got to the restaurant and they didn't have lobster bisque.  I had the special, swordfish au poivre, and it was good, but very rich, and wasn't feeling very well a few hours later.  The wine list wasn't as extensive and one would expect for a nice seafood restaurant in Phoenix.  I have to say that in general, the food wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything special, but it was very expensive. We agreed that next time we wanted a good bowl of bisque we'd go next door to the Capital Grille

I have to say that I really enjoy eating at Sacks.  It's definitely one of my top two lunch spots for yummy quick eats.  I've sampled quite a bit of the menu and my second favorite sandwich is the O'Keefe.  It's basically chopped chicken, sautéed mushrooms, melted Swiss, avocado, lettuce, tomato and honey mustard served hot on a soft baguette.  The honey mustard gives it just enough tang to really bring out the flavor of the seasoned chicken.  My only "beef" with this sandwich is hot lettuce.  I'm sorry, but there are some things in this universe that were not meant to be, and lettuce being served on a hot sandwich (or on a hot Mexican food plate; more on that later) is not one of them!    My most favorite sandwich here is the Symphony.  I like to think of it as a turkey club with a twist.  It's loaded with fresh turkey breast deli style meat, bacon, avocado, tomatoes, LOTS of alfalfa sprouts, cream cheese and mayo on wonderful 12 grain bread.  I usually hold the mayo, because that's just the kinda guy I am.  You might say, that's how I roll. But I say, I'm just not a mayo kinda guy...  The best part about lunch at Sacks is the silver dollar sized warm chocolate chip cookie you get with your sandwich.  And yes, it's been reported that the Tiki sometimes eats the cookie first, but having no photographic evidence, you can't prove it and I'll plead the 5th.  And speaking of tiki's there's a really cool Tiki at the Tutor Time just a few doors down to the north.  Check it out!  Okay, I said the cookie was the best part of lunch at Sacks, but I lied.  The really super dooper best part about lunch at Sacks is the Market Spice Iced Tea.  Some days it's too weak, some days it's too strong, but on the days that it's just right, it will blow your socks off, so you might want to bring an extra pair, just to be safe!  My only dislike about Sacks is that is can get pretty loud at lunch.  It's usually crowded between 12-12:30 so I try to go early or after 1 pm.  And don't forget, you can always call ahead and take it to go!

Chuy's is one of those places that doesn't quite qualify as a dive bar/restaurant, but is close enough to count.  I like Chuy's.  It's like a mini-vacation every time you go.  Part beach bar, part pseudo-tiki (any place that has thatch palm fronds above the bar gets a star in my book!), you'll feel like you're on a beach somewhere every time you visit.   It's nice to have one within walking distance to the office, to allow for a little exercise to and from and still have a good meal.  Their prices are reasonable.  I've been struggling to find a lunch under $10 these days, and the Tri-tip sandwich and an iced tea will set you back a ten spot and some change.  The food is good, did I mention that?  The staff is friendly, and they finally did away with the cheap-o' paper towels and put real napkin dispensers on each table...FTW!   There's an unlimited chips and salsa bar, I like the cabo sauce the best for my chips.  I always add a little Baja sauce; you have to ask for it at the counter, to whatever I'm enjoying.  Today it happened to be the Tri-tip sandwich.  I give it 4 out of 5 stars because even though they have to-go cups, this is Phoenix.  It is 108* outside and the full glass of iced tea I left the restaurant with was gone by the time I got back to the office.  There should be a City-wide ordinance that all restaurants must supply patrons with at least a 32 oz. to-go cup during working hours.  All right, I confess that might be a little much.  The only down-side to Chuy's at lunch I've found so far is having to go back to work afterwards and not being able to enjoy a Corona with my lunch.  That's okay though, it just one more reason to go back.

I'd heard about Subs by Jim from a co-worker who said it was the best sub place in town.  So I thought I'd try it out and see for myself.  Would I say it's the "Best" sub in town, probably not...But it's darn close.  I'm a ham and pineapple kind of guy and love Hawaiian Pizza, so when I saw they had a Hawaiian Melt sandwich I had to try it out.  I'm glad I did.  They piled a ton of ham on that thing! Well, okay, not a ton, but the meat was over an inch thick  with melted swiss on top and chunks of Pineapple in between the meat and bread.  It was Amazing!  I also had a bag of chips and a medium drink which came out to $10.02 exactly, about par for lunch in this area of town.  It was a great value and I left very full.  Truth be told, I'll probably stick with the half sandwich next time and maybe try one of the soups when it cools off a bit outside.  The other thing I really liked was the décor.  It's very simple, but quite a bit of baseball memorabilia on the walls, along with an 80's era mural of a baseball game that looks like the view from the left fielder's position.  If you have little ones, be sure to check the shelf on the way out the door, rumor has it there's a cup with lollipops in it next to the stack of magazines.

After an awesome evening at "The Blooze" two things have become self evident.  One: I need to get my tattoo.  Two: The Blooze has officially dethroned "The Bikini" as my favorite dive bar.   We went to "The Blooze" last night to check out a couple of surf-rock bands, The Surfside IV and Secrete Samurai, from San Diego.  Now normally, The Blooze is a NASCAR haven.  NASCAR memorabilia adorns every surface but the floor in the place.   I was a little apprehensive of checking out this place, but there was no need to worry.  This place is great.  Plenty of seating throughout the bar, a dance floor, and they even had Guinness on tap which is always good.   While the bands were playing classic movies featuring Tony Randall and Jane Mansfield were playing on the many TV screens throughout the bar.  There are two pool tables that were occupied most of the evening.  Outside they had VIP parking for hotrods so it was like a mini car show and great music.  The best part about the night was the Surfside go-go dancers and their little "Devilette" horns. Very cute!  All in all, I give "The Blooze" four out of 5 stars and look forward to the next Surf Rock band night.

Not since the likes of "Pronto's" and "Il Pescatore" has Phoenix tasted Italian food like this.  Yes, it's in a strip mall, but don't let that fool you.  This place is 100% top quality Italian!  Besides, what place in Phoenix isn't in a strip mall these days?    My wife found a review of this little gem online and said we had to check it out.  I'm so glad she did! We arrived and were promptly seated.  The wait staff was attentive, but not overly so.  We had our choice of seats which was a nice touch.  The wine list is more than adequate with many nice selections available by the glass.  The bread was nice and warm with really nice pesto/garlic butter.  Our salads arrived promptly, I had the Caesar and it was very good.  Our entree's followed shortly thereafter and this is pretty much where my mind gets foggy...  I had veal...it was heavenly, lightly breaded and oh-so tender.  It was bathed in a lemon sauce; much like you'd find in a piccata dish, but instead of capers, it had artichokes and mushrooms.  Did I mention heaven?  If artichokes or mushrooms aren't to your liking, the veal piccata that my wife had was amazing!  I'm actually a little jealous that she "Out-Ordered" me this time.  Her Gnocchi Pasta was a side dish of perfection.  The texture was a perfect firmness and not overcooked.  The pink sauce was again, Heavenly.  We finished our dinner with coffee and tiramisu.  It was again; Heavenly.  Are you noticing a trend?  There were also plenty of options for vegetarians.  Eggplant parmesan and spaghetti come to mind.  For fine Italian food, I'd say that Roma Garden is fairly priced.  Two salads, two entrée's, one glass of wine, one iced tea, one coffee and one shared dessert later, we left for less than $70 before tip. Our last bit of Heavenly bliss occurred when the waiter brought us our bill.  He also brought us complementary drinks of amaretto on the rocks.  (I really gotta stop writing these reviews before lunch.) Bonnito Appetito!

Our first visit to Via was about five years ago shortly after we moved into the "Slope" aka Sunnyslope.  Back then the waiters were surly, the food was good, and the 99 cent margaritas would knock you on your tukus.  About the only thing that's changed in that time is the margaritas are now $2.99, but you'll still get the same great food and the same surly service.  Well, that's not entirely true of the service.  It's been my experience that if it's a slow night and you have a female server, then your service will be top notch.  If it's busy or you happen to get a male server, then it can get a little frustrating.  I personally think they have the best mild salsa in town.  I always fill up on chips and salsa then feel like someone needs to roll me out the door because I'm so full after dinner.  The portion sizes are huge, so you can't go wrong there.  My favorite dish is the #3 combination, Green Chili Con Carne with rice and beans.  My only complaint is the same with every other Mexican Food restaurant in town, is the lettuce they use as a garnish on the plate.  I've said it before and I'll say it again...Heck I might even climb up "S" mountain and scream it from there..."COLD LETTUCE HAS NO PLACE ON A HOT PLATE OF MEXICAN FOOD!"  There, I feel much better now.  But seriously, you don't eat the lettuce, at least I don't, and even when I accidently do, it's hot and soggy.  Who likes that?  But I digress.  The bar is small, and always crowded.  The patio is nice if the weather is good.  Their list of tequilas is almost two pages long on their menu.  So if you're a tequila aficionado, then you should check it out.  If I had to rate Via on food alone, I'd give it four and a half stars.  If I had to rate via on service alone I'd have to give it two and a half stars only because it's spotty approximately half of the time.  So if I average them together Via would get three and half stars, but I'm going to round it up to four because the last few times, the service has been better and I really like the place.

So what do you do on a Sunday night in Phoenix for fun?  If you're the kind of person who drives around searching for neighborhood dive bars, then sit back, get comfy, and read on.  To say that Shady's is a dive bar may not be entirely accurate.  My wife and I were coming home from dinner after a movie and decided to stop in for a quick drink.  We'd heard about the place, but had never actually stopped in before tonight.  We entered through the back door and immediately felt as if we had walked into someone's basement.  The "L" shaped bar and friendly bartender were very inviting.  Having both New Castle and Guinness on tap, I felt my Irish/English heritage come alive and I knew I was going to have a hard time not liking this place. We ordered our drinks and milled around a bit.  I noticed the fireplace with candles burning inside and thought that was a nice touch.  I was also digging the groovy teal/turquoise lounge chairs.  I wasn't able to test them for comfortability, but since they were all occupied, one would have to assume they fit the bill.  I'll have to make another trip to Shady's and test them out myself.  We did make it into the back room with the pool table and found a very comfortable, corner booth that was perfect for two.  We had a great view of the ongoing pool game and the rest of the bar.   The fact that Shady's has a jukebox that actually plays music even when no one has put money in it sealed the deal for their fifth star for me.  They have a great selection of music, including many hits from the 80's, which totally rocks for me man!  We got there around 10 pm on a Sunday night and it was fairly busy, but by the time we left, about an hour later, the place was full.  Not bad for a Sunday night in Phoenix.  I'm thinking a happy hour is in short order at Shady's.

I've been going to Acacia Café for the better part of two years now.  I said Sack's was one of my two favorite lunch spots, and Acacia is the other.    I think I've pretty much eaten my way through their menu and can't say I've ever had a bad experience there.  Whether you're in the mood for breakfast or lunch, Acacia never disappoints.  I love their Miami Ham, their take on a Cuban.  I also really like their Chicken Caesar salad, chicken salad on a croissant, veggie panini, Egg Salad, Omelet, and I could go on, but I'll spare you.  Okay wait. If you like soup, their daily chicken noodle is better than Mom made, Yes, sorry Mom (She only made Campbell's anyway).  And on Thursdays, I really like their Turkey Chili  The place get's hoppin' around noon so either go around 11:30 or wait until 1:00 if you don't like crowds.  The patio is great anytime other than summer.  They used to serve China Mist iced tea, which I really liked, but now they serve a different brand that I don't care for as much.  I brought this to their attention, and was told I was the only one who had said anything about it.  That's okay though, it is still good tea.    My only complaint with the place is the tables are a little close together, but it's great if you want to hear all about why Facebook and Twitter are going to be the downfall of our society because of all the psychopaths using them, or who did what with who the night before even though you don't know them or them.

Pie Zano's...File this one under "Super Yummy Can't Wait To Go Back!"  We've been a fan of Pie Zano's for quite some time now.  It's a quaint neighborhood eatery where you can make your own pizza, salad or sandwich.  It's great for vegetarians, carnivores, and omnivores alike.  I've probably eaten my way through about half of their menu and so far have never been disappointed.  A few of my favorites are the Pie-talian sandwich, chicken ranchero sandwich, the garden pizza and the buffalo pizza.  There was a lot of local buzz about a gluten free beer, Redbridge, so I gave it a try.  It's good.  Can't really tell any difference between it and non-gluten free beer.  It's a great place for lunch.  A sandwich, chips and a fountain drink are just under $10.    For those of you in the Northwest Valley, the owner said he's getting ready to open up a new location in the Arrowhead Mall part of town.  It won't be in the mall, but close to it.  Check it out soon!  Super friendly staff, consistently good food and great atmosphere are reasons I go back.  You should too!

This is a tough review for me to write.  Have you ever felt like you wanted to like something, and whatever it was, was just kind of "Meh..." and you left wondering why?  Well that was my experience at 92nd St. Café.  My wife and I had an engagement on that side of town and we were about a half hour early so we thought we'd stop in for a drink first.  We walked in and sat at the bar, and my first impression was that it was a "Neighborhood Bar", as in, if you don't live in the "neighborhood" then this bar isn't for you.  It's hard to explain.  The patrons were mostly middle aged men and a couple of women.  We sat at the bar and were basically ignored for the first five minutes we were there while the bartender (picture Johnny Bravo from the cartoon network) talked on his cell phone, flirted with the female patron(s), and wiped down the glasses.  We were finally served by a really nice lady who appeared from the back of the restaurant and we were promptly served.  My wife had a Guinness and I had a Crown and Coke.  The pour was strong and the total was $11.  We noticed a sign proclaiming karaoke Wed-Sat from 9pm-1:30am.  We spied the karaoke setup in the corner and grabbed a book and saw they had a pretty decent selection of songs, so we decided to stop back by after our engagement and check it out.  Later that night, we returned, and karaoke was in full swing...well sorta.  There were two singers.  The host was doing his best to get other singers up, but just wasn't having much luck.  In between singers he played a mix of Lady Gaga and Kid Rock so it wasn't quite as awkward, although it was rather loud.  We were hungry so we ordered some food.  I got the sliders and my wife had the crab rangoon appetizer.  I didn't try the rangoon, but the sliders were fair.  The sliders consisted of basically a hamburger patty cut into quarters with cheese and grilled onions on top.  It was dark and I didn't notice the grilled onions when I read the menu or I would have declined as they don't agree with me.  But that was my fault not theirs.  We didn't end up singing because we just weren't feeling it, if you know what I mean.  But the waiter was super nice and very prompt.  It was a completely different crowd at night than it was earlier in the evening.  So would I go back? Maybe, if I was in the neighborhood, but I wouldn't make a special trip to the place...again, for me, it was just "Meh".

We've been waiting for Bertha's to reopen for quite some time.  I had eaten at their previous location a couple of times, but my wife had not.  So we were really excited to hear they had opened during the week and were looking forward to checking them out over the weekend.    Now usually when my wife and I go out, we decide on different things so we get to try a couple of items off the menu.  This time however, we both chose the "Salami Pesto and Goat Cheese Sandwich".  I have to say that it was REALLY good.  I could have used a little more salami on it, but I won't complain too loudly.  I'm glad to see they were busy and doing really well.  The menu looks like it might have been expanded a bit since the move, but all the old favorites are there.  I did like the interior décor, the photographs are really nice.    There's quite a bit more room in the new place, which will serve them well during lunch time.  The best thing is I work right across the street so I can walk there for lunch.  Speaking of which, it is 11:30...Guess where I'm going.

Okay Radio Milano, I have a confession to make.  I have secretly and unfairly harbored borderline hatred in my heart for you since you overtook the space that once held my favorite Italian restaurant, Pronto's.  I know hate is a strong word, but that is truly how I felt for almost two years.  However, that all changed, last Saturday night.  Radio Milano, can you ever forgive me?  You know how you secretly spy on an ex after you break up, just to see what they're up to so you don't get blindsided one day by showing up at the same place.  You know the scenario, you're alone and they are there... looking as fabulous as ever... with their new someone...who also looks as fabulous as ever and the situation is more than...awkward?  Well, in the interest of full disclosure, I've been following @radioMILANO on twitter for awhile now, silently cursing them every time they posted some wonderful looking creation from their kitchen that just made my mouth water.  Yes, I still miss Pronto's.  So after I saw their Saturday Chalkboard Surf and Turf Special, I decided to be the bigger person, put on a happy face, and confront my inner demon.  It took me two weeks to work up the courage (actually, we had prior commitments for 2 weekends), but finally, we made it!  And am I glad we did!  First let me say, that once inside, I was completely shocked at the renovation that had taken place.  I did not recognize the space at all, save the arched ceilings.  The ambiance is amazing.  I totally felt like a hipster in an old school Rat Pack flick.  The place just wreaked, "Coolness"!  We were promptly seated upon our arrival. We ordered our drinks; I had a glass of wine, my wife had a mixed drink (something pink) that resembled a cosmo, but made with pomegranate juice.  We looked over the menu, even though we were there for the special and found many things we would have otherwise enjoyed, had we not been there for the surf and turf.  We started with an order of the deviled eggs.  Can I just say that these were THE BEST deviled eggs I've ever had?  The consistency of the yolk was more of an egg salad, and the flavors were incredible.  We just finished with our appetizer when our main course arrived.  The presentation was excellent!  The petite lobster tail was cooked to perfection, as was the petite filet!  The steamed broccoli was not overdone and the mashed potatoes were amazing!  Unfortunately, we didn't get to sample the dessert menu because we were both stuffed!  It was a pleasure to meet the person behind the @radioMILANO twitter account.  He's a very nice guy.  Yes, I remember his name, but since he doesn't have it posted on his twitter account, I won't post it here.  We really enjoyed our night out at Radio Milano and can't wait to return.  So...Am I forgiven yet?

Of all the times I've eaten at Switch, I can't believe I haven't written a review yet!  Switch is our Sunday Brunch.  We love the place.  The ambiance is great! We love the paintings on the walls.  We usually get a table next to the window along Central Ave. and it's great to watch the world go by while you dine with those you adore!  For me, that's my lovely wife.   I've sampled quite a bit of the menu at Switch.  The Red Sangria is amazing, as are the crepes.  We love the seafood crepes and the Ham and Cheese crepes as well.  I've also had the cowboy burger which is quite good and the French Dip is incredible also.  Lately, we've fallen in love with the fruit and cheese plate.  The fig jam is AMAZING! (edit: I forgot the candied walnuts!  How could I forget the candied walnuts?  You gotta try the candied walnuts!) :-)  Whether there are just a couple of you, or a whole group, Switch can accommodate.  The only thing I'd change about Switch would be not to charge extra if you want to "switch" something like fries for the Caesar salad.  But that's just a personal preference.  Good Stuff here!

I was excited to try BJ's since I've had some positive experiences with Brewery's in the past few months. However, I left unimpressed.  I can't say the food was bad, but it wasn't remarkable. I had the burger, which was okay, but very greasy. My wife had one of the pizzas that had what appeared to be canned or stewed tomatoes on it which she thought were rather bland and tasteless.    I wasn't able to sample any of the brew selections due to constraints of the diet, but my wife did have a pint of their featured ale and she said it was really good.  The service was decent, and there was about a 15 minute wait to get seated.  All in all, I don't think I'd go back and so I'm filing this one under, "been there, done that...You can keep the tee shirt."

First let me say, that as a straight guy, I'm always a little apprehensive about going to gay bars for karaoke.  I know! I know! But my wife and I enjoy singing and have found it difficult to find places with decent sound systems that also have a decent catalogue of music, so I deal with it.  I've been to Kobalt twice now, the first time with my wife, and last night with a group of friends.  We had a lot of fun both times.  The music selection is one of the best we've found, although the sound system can be a little "off".  Sometimes the feedback can get a little strong on the wireless microphones.  I guess we're just spoiled by our regular karaoke haunt, and our hostess who mixes the music so you sound really good.  Here, it's just you and music baby!  I have to say, the crowd at Kobalt is really different (in a good way) than some of the other bars in town.  The patrons are very friendly, and very respectful (well, everyone except for the guy that told our friend she was built like a "Brick Sh!thouse!"  I'm pretty sure he was just trying to tell her in his own way that she looked very lovely, which she did).  But seriously, that was a one-off and you get those in every crowd.   The bartender is really nice, very attentive, and remembered what we ordered from last week.  Huge props and huge tips!  The Karaoke host is great.  Works in new singers in a timely fashion and makes sure everyone has a good time.    There's been a lot of talk about the smell of popcorn in previous reviews.  It's true; they have a popcorn machine by the patio door.  I've never tried it, but there's only been crumbs left when we got there both times so I guess it goes good with beer, apple martini's or whatever your choice of drink may be. I didn't find the smell overwhelming though, as some have said.  As for the catalogue, they have plenty to choose from.  You'll find a nice selection of country, rock, and of course...Showtunes!  You're almost guaranteed to hear Rent, Phantom, All that Jazz and plenty of old standards by Sinatra and the rest of the Pack.  FTW!  It was a little difficult to find at first, but if you drive around to the North side of the building, you can park under the structure and you'll see the sign in the breezeway.  I give Kobalt 4 out of 5 stars only because they don't have karaoke on a night when I don't have to get up early for work the next morning.  If you're ever in the neighborhood, check it out!

I'd have to say that in the course of five minutes I spent five dollars, gained five pounds, added five inches to my waistline, and took five years off of my life.  But I knew that going in and did it anyway.  Where, you ask, can you also clog your arteries and love every precious minute of the experience?  Lucky Boy is the place.  We ordered the quarter pound Lucky International with fries.  I added bacon, green chili and cheese to mine.  It was pure heartburn; I mean heaven, at first bite.  All of the Lucky Boy burgers include lettuce, tomato, pickles, and onions, but you can hold any or all of the included condiments.  The Lucky International also includes 1000 island dressing. Was it messy?  Absolutely!  Would I do it again?  Absolutely!  The fries were amazing.  Real cut potatoes with the perfect amount of salt and crispiness.   I also had the small shake, which was really quite large.  They were really good.  You can mix up to two of the 14 flavors for the same price.  But I'm a purist so I stuck with chocolate.  They also have hotdogs, corndogs and grilled cheese for the little ones.  If you're really in a hurry, you can always order to go and they have a drive-thru as well.  There are three reasons why Lucky Boy only gets four out of five stars.  1.  Every little thing you add is an extra, including refills, but it's so inexpensive it's not really a big deal.  2. It was very warm inside.  No A/C.  Maybe that's why the prices are so low. (*Edit to add they do have fans and evaporative cooling so it wasn't too terribly bad.)  3. No restroom to wash my hands afterwards.  These burgers are very messy!  If you ever need a cheap eats night, this would be a great place for it.

Oh man...where do I start? This had to be the worst dining experience of my life. We show up and it's a 25-minute wait for two. Okay, that's normal. But wait, you have to stand outside, and it was 109 degrees today. They had a canopy set up, gee thanks! But how about a glass of water while I wait? Not here! I'm so glad I had a little bit of iced tea left in my cup from AJ's this morning.  So we get seated; get this, outside under an enclosed wooden canopy! Who does that to their patrons in Phoenix in the summer? They had misters, but they were nowhere near us. They had a fan mounted on the patio roof, but it blew right over the top of us and did no good. I think they sell portable evaporative coolers at Home Depot. That would have been nice!  So I'm looking at the menu and trying to decide what I want to eat when I see the waitress bring out an order to a table near us. I'm a bacon freak and I love it extra crispy. The order she brought out had bacon and it was cooked to perfection! Things were starting to look up. When she set the small plate down in front of the little girl, I didn't think anything of it. It was an adequate portion...for a nine year old.  We'll return to this in a moment.   So the waitress takes our order and I excuse myself to use the washroom and wash my hands. So I ask where the washroom is, thinking it's inside. I was politely told it was located in the back...As in, go outside, around the back, and there you'll see them. As I walk around the corner, I suddenly feel as if I'm entering a washroom at a grungy service station. The washrooms weren't clean, weren't air conditioned, and the urinal didn't flush. Can you see where this is going?  So back to my seat, our order arrives, and guess what, it's the same size as what I had earlier thought was a kid's portion.  I'm so glad it was hot and I wasn't super hungry.  So how was the food? Well, the eggs were runny, the hash browns were completely overdone on the outside, but still raw on the inside, and the bacon...well, let's just say that a couple of Band-Aids and that pig would be out wallerin' around in the mud again.  I'll admit. I should have done a little research on my part before eating here, but I seriously doubt I'll go back. At least Denny's is consistent and has clean bathrooms.  I'll give the place one star because at least they had two cool photos of Marilyn Monroe in the Men's Room.

I dig Maizie's.  It's a great little place just south of Camelback on Central.  The staff is ultra-friendly and courteous, the food is great, and the atmosphere is awesome!  We've been there a handful of times now and I haven't yet found something I don't like there.  My favorite is the "near-famous" (or is it "soon-to-be-famous", I can't remember which) chili, which is awesome, by the way.  I've had the burger and it's pretty good as well.  My wife's favorite dish is the wingless buffalo dip.  I have to agree with her, it's really good!  And they serve it with a mixture of chips and pita bread.  In my opinion, the only way they could make it better would be to lose the chips and just serve it with extra pita bread.  I saw a sign on the door saying they have free wi-fi, although Maizie's seems more like a place to be social and hang with friends.  The patio is really nice.  They have a great selection of wine and beer, including my current favorite, Four Peaks Kiltlifter, on tap. The only negative thing about Maizie's I've found so far is that it can be a little warm when it gets busy.  And I'm not just talking about the spice in the Chili, although it has a nice bit of heat as well!

Dear Lola Coffee.  You're like that ex-girlfriend one keeps going back to after the breakup is long past. You know the kind, the kind that keeps coming back begging for "another" second chance, saying she's sorry, saying she'll change, saying things will be different this time.  And you, you take her back again, not because you think this time will be different, but because deep down you're still in love with her and when you're together it's "Oh-So-Good".  But just about the time you really want her, really need her...Poof...She's gone.  Leaving you with another broken heart and lying there in a puddle of heartache and salty tears next to an empty bottle of John Daniels wondering when, no if, if you'll ever see her again.  Lola Coffee, I love you!  You're great!  You're amazing!  You're everything I'd ever want in a coffee shop; great coffee, amazing pastries, and awesome and friendly barista's.  If I were single and you were a girl, you'd be my type.  But there's just this one little thing we're going to have to fix if this relationship were to work.  You see, I need you to be OPEN when I want coffee.  I work during the day.  I'd love the stop in at 10:30 for a nice steaming cup of your morning brew.  But I work across town, and someone has to earn a living.  After work, I'm tired. I'm hungry.  I go home and have a nice dinner.  It's then around 8:30, or 9:00 that I'd love to come in and have a cup or two, snuggle up with a good book or my laptop and do what people do in coffee shops.  But every time I'm out and about and think about dropping by, you're CLOSED!    If only you'd stay open until, say, 10:00 every night, I'm sure that with Hula's, and Maizie's next door, you'd have plenty of business to make it profitable.  Not to mention the fact that you'd make one, actually two, coffee lovers very happy.  With heartfelt love,  A secret admirer

Sun Country Landscaping has been the landscape maintenance contractor at our townhome community for almost three years now.  I guess you could say that in the past, we've had some real "Humdingers" when it comes to landscape maintenance contractors.    I'm always hesitant to recommend a landscape maintenance contractor to anyone due to my past experience.  I had always felt that a landscape maintenance contractor would do a great job for about 4-6 months, and then get lazy.  Nothing makes me more frustrated than to see Texas Rangers, or any shrub for that matter, shaped into 4' spheres or cubes.  Being the resident landscape architect, I was asked a few years ago to help find a new landscape contractor who charged reasonable rates, was dependable, and understood basic horticultural maintenance procedures.  We interviewed many companies, checked many references, and visited many properties that each company currently maintained.  It was a unanimous decision by our landscape committee and our HOA Board of Directors to use Sun Country Landscaping.  They are licensed, bonded, and insured.  They also verify the employment status of all of their workers.  They are fast, reliable, and reputable. We are extremely pleased with their service, even almost three years later.  Sun Country Landscaping offers both landscape design and installation services in addition to landscape maintence.  One last note:  As always, with any contractor, please check their status with Registrar of Contractors to make sure they have resolved any complaints on file before you hire them.

A co-worker noticed Teakwood's was open for business a couple of weeks ago and suggested we go try it out for lunch.  So today we got a group of four together and off we went.  First impression was this is a nice little sports bar.  Think Applebee's meets Lonestar and you've got yourself a pretty good idea of what Teakwood's is like.  Teakwood's has plenty of booths, tables, a bar, and some groovy crescent shaped loveseats with bistro tables on one side of the room.  There's also an arcade on the east end.  There were probably a dozen or so TV's with different sporting events playing.    The service was prompt, the menu was typical bar and grill fare.  Buckets of peanuts on the table and we were instructed to leave our hulls on the floor.  We all got chicken sandwiches.  Three of which were buffalo style with varying degrees of "hotness".  I got the Hot and it was spicy, but not overly so.  The interesting thing is they grill the chicken breast and then bring you the wing sauce on the side.  I guess it's healthier than a fried crispy sandwich.  I also ordered tater tots as my side as did one other person, one of us had fruit and the other had fries.    All in all we were all satisfied with our meals.  The portion sizes were large and the drinks were in monster plastic cups.  I almost asked for a to-go cup, but I got up to wash my hands and my tea was gone when I came back.  The total for a sandwich and an iced tea came to $12.71.  We're looking forward to going back to try some of their other lunch items.

We've wanted to try Thai E-San since they opened, and we finally made it down.  The ambiance is very nice.  The music was soothing and appropriate, but the food left something to be desired.  We started with the pork satay.  The pork was very good and perfectly cooked.  But the peanut sauce was bland and chalky.  I couldn't taste the peanut.  For our entrée we ordered the Panang; Chicken with carrots in coconut milk and peanut sauce.  Maybe it's just me, but I don't like the spice that makes your food taste like lemon cleaning fluid.  Is it ginger? I don't know really.  But the Panang had a lot of it and that was all I could taste.  The service was good and the other patrons seemed to enjoy their meals, so to be fair, I would have to reserve judgment on Thai E-San until I've tried a few other things on their menu.  The problem is, we really like Thai Lahna and they aren't much further away.

Dive Bar Heaven? Maybe. The night we went the jukebox wasn't on but they were playing some groovy 80's tunes. There's a pool table in the front room where you walk in. The roof lines are great mid century modern goodness. I love the ceiling. The bartender pours a fair drink I'm told. I'll have to make another trip after I'm off this diet. I'm looking forward to checking it out on the second Saturday of the month for Obscura (formally at the Ruby Room).

I LOVE La Condesa.  What more do I need to say? The salsa bar is amazing! I really like their carne asada.  They do but beans in the burrito, which, at first I wasn't sure how I'd feel about it, but after a couple, I really like it.  I've had the pork and shrimp tacos also.  The quality is always top notch.  I did the artwork too!  Two negatives...The music can sometimes be loud, and sometimes they are REALLY packed and parking is a bit tough to find.  Other than that, I HIGHLY recommend!

Gotta say this is my FAVORITE FroYo place in the valley! The staff is friendly, the toppings are always fresh and the yogurt flavors rotate pretty frequently. I love the Red Velvet the best, and their pistachio second. And don't EVEN think about taking my mayorship...I'll hurt you!

It's great to see a new FroYo place opening up in our neighborhood.  Okay, it's not "litterally" in our neighborhood, but it's in the same zip code.  I really like the atmosphere, and they have 12 different flavors.  Also, Tons of toppings which is a huge plus.  I was pretty full from dinner when we went so I went light on the Pumpkin Pie and added Cap'n Crunch and a few Snowcaps. I really like the open air vibe and the workers are very friendly and helpful. Parking is the only downside, but hey, can't win them all.  Really liked it!
