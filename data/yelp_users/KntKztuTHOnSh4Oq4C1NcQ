We likED this place so much that we invited ten of our friends to join us. Quality was sub par at best. Service was also less than spectacular. Not sure if we will give them another chance in August.

Our EX favorite restaurant.  We have been getting food delivered from this place for years now and all of a sudden they don't deliver to our area?  We spend on average $50 on each order we place with them and ordered as recently as last month, but now the 'manager on duty' decides that they arent going to take our order this time?  Don't get me wrong...great food, but SH*TTY customer service.  You just lost yourself a long time customer and one of your biggest fans.

Almost a weekly visit for me, this place is amazing.  I have yet to explore the menu as I am fixated on a few items and always have been.    Spicy Cold Cucumber Noodles and the famous Soup Dumplings (Xiaolongbao)  I have made both of these at home, and while I am pretty close on the noodles, the soup dumplings, aside from being a day long affair to make, are still a mystery to me.  These guys have it down pat!    See you next week!

Don't sit at the bar unless you have a ton of time to kill...  mediocre food saved by good beer. This place is getting lazy.

Always a good time. They treat us like regulars...probably cuz we are. We are here at least once every two weeks and it's great every time. Went for Kobe beef night a couple weeks back...I think you have to experience it once and judge for yourself.

So....I was really looking forward to our lunch here.  We had been to its predecessor Latitude 8 a few times and it was a good spot in one of our favorite parts of Chandler.  After reading the reviews I figured the food would be great and the service would be 'relaxed' ...but good.  Allow me to preface this with the fact that years ago, serving tables and bar-tending was my livelihood, so I am a pretty good judge of when a server is swamped vs when a server that is just not skilled and is drowning...unfortunately we experienced both today.  We were seated almost immediately when we waked in and expected the waiter to bring waters back and take a drink order...or at least come back...when he didn't and after seeing three other tables be seated and have drinks already, I waved him over and asked if we could have some waters w lemon and a beer ,and that we would be ready to order once he returned.  I gave him the benefit of the doubt as it WAS somewhat busy, but not too busy to serve the tables that came in after us...but I digress.  About 15 minutes later he came back with the water....no lemon...no beer, we placed our order and I politely asked him to retrieve the missing items and he said he would.  Another fifteen minutes pass and I stop his counterpart to let him know that perhaps his waiter buddy was too busy and asked if he could get the lemons and beer.  He was quite apologetic and said he would and also asked if we had ordered...I told him maybe we should re-order as the other waiter didn't seem to grasp everything, so we did.  This guy came right back with the lemons and beer, apologized again and said that he would be taking care of us from now on.  Our appetizer emerged about 15 minutes after that...along with my lunch,  carried by the original waiter.  He paused when he saw the look I gave him and asked if he should take my meal back to the kitchen...aggravated at this point, I told him to just leave it.  The food was pretty great!  Everything very fresh and flavorful.  Summer rolls(Fresh rolls) were just ok and I would have expected a little more creativity, but like I said they were fresh and their peanut sauce was pretty good.  I had two other fresh items: Miang Khum (coconuts wraps) and the Lettuce Wraps.  Both had great flavor but very cheap on the meat...the "prawns" were finely diced and maybe had a total of two tablespoons for the entire plate and the ground chicken, while seasoned correctly, was quite grisly.  My GFs meal showed up just as we finished sharing the Summer Rolls, she ordered the Paht Si-io (Pad See Ew), a dish she orders at every Thai place we go and unfortunately was not impressed.  She ordered hot and this was barely mild.  Also it was really not seasoned very well at all...and the "Chinese Broccoli" was nothing more than run of the mill broccoli florets.    Our meal ended up getting discounted which was appreciated, and the 'good' server was again apologetic.  However we were left once again waiting 5 mins for someone to take our card to pay.  Overall not the best experience, but perhaps we will visit again in the evening to see if it gets better.
