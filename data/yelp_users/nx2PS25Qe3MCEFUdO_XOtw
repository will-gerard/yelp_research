I would have never know that That's A Wrap existed if one of my coworkers hadn't known about it and suggested lunch there after a press conference at the capital.    It's seemingly a little shack, but inside it's very clean (aesthetically to the eye and physically).  A great place to grab lunch, their menu includes wraps, salads, rice bowls, and smoothies.    All of the menu items are quirk-ily named which adds kitschy-ness and sometimes a conversation topic to a lunch out.  The wraps are VERY filling and the sides are small.  Sometimes I wish I could have more side and less wrap, but I'm never hungry after eating the meal.  Writing this review is making me hungry...

This is my uncle's favorite Chinese place in Phoenix...and I have no idea why.  It's a little junk Chinese food spot...but it begs the question: "Isn't Junk Chinese at least supposed to taste good?"  I mean, I know what I'm putting into my body isn't actually good for me, but Gourmet House of Hong Kong makes the act of eating it not even pleasurable...so what exactly is the point?  The spot isn't very clean (the bathroom=complete ew).  The noodles are gummy, the tofu is rubbery...The sweet and sour sauce was kind of good, but I think it added to my stomach ache (which began mid meal).  The crunchy things they'll give you if you ask--those are good.  Crunchy things and a semi-doable sweet and sour do not a restaurant going experience make.

"Left to my own devices I will always choose Panne Bianco,"  I explained to my boss as I entered the office with yet another brown paper bag with handles containing a goat cheese based sandwich.  It's one of the sandwiches that isn't on the menu every day.  It is delicious.  There are three sandwiches that are every day and one that rotates.  On a day when the rotating sandwich isn't something I'd like, I get the Mozzarella, Basil, and Tomato sandwich.  I don't really like tomatoes, but Panne Bianco has this down perfectly.  Included with each sandwich (and I imagine all the other lunches, but I've never gotten a salad because I LOVE the bread of the sandwiches too much) is a chocolate...mmm.  I feel like I'm five, shopping at the Ranch Market with my grandmother being allowed to pick out one candy as we leave the store.  When they have pomegranate seeds in a little container for $1.50 I can't resist.  I want to buy every single thing they have in Panne Bianco (it's simple inside, just a counter where you order, an expansive back area that is completely open, showcasing a large oven, no seating inside).  The little bookshelf full of expensive olive oil and salted capers are just calling my name every time.  It's a complete addiction, especially since it's so close to where I work.  They are closed on Mondays, so plan accordingly.  Oh, PS the staff is very nice and helpful. PLUS, despite Panne Bianco's often local-grown offerings and quirkiness, the staff isn't so "Indie" or self involved that I want to throw up.  I never feel like I don't belong there, and I don't imagine anyone ever does.

I was referred to Central Shoe Repair by the only other person in the world who might (*might*) like shoes more than I do...  It was a late night in the office when suddenly, out of no where, I broke a heel on my favorite pair of black booties.  I hadn't broken a heel since homecoming sophomore year of high school...and my little booties were not going to just take to some epoxy like the shoes in high school did.  First of all, the heel wasn't just broken off...it was splintered in the middle, so I knew it was going to be a little difficult to attach.  When I took it to a shop near my house they said: "No, absolutely not, we can't do anything about that."  What??  My precious shoes!  So then, I went promptly to Shoes on Central (as I should have done from the beginning) and hoped that they would be able to fix them.  Bella wasn't sure, but she took it in the back and had her husband look over it.  Thank goodness; they were able to fix them!  They were going to have to order a whole new set of heels and reattach them, but they could do it!  The quality of work was amazing--the shoes looked phenomenal.  My only complaint was that they took about two weeks longer than they said they would (and so my shoes missed out on an Irish adventure--as this was the spring I went to Dublin), but ultimately the work was so well done that it was worth it.  I really just need to trek all of my shoes that need touch-ups over there ASAP.

Every year on my uncle's birthday (December 31st) my entire extended family (and usually some friends) goes to Ajo Al's.    Every year my Father (or one of my uncles) gets me to split a giant (GIANT) plate (really enormous platter pan) of nachos.  Every year there are at least 20 of us.  Every year the food is good and we have an amazing time.   The menu is expansive, but not overwhelming, so anyone can find something he or she likes (even if you don't care for Mexican food, you can find something more American...without this place feeling like an Applebees...because it certainly doesn't).  The service is not always the best (always nice, but sometimes slow), ESPECIALLY if they sit you on the patio (they usually forget about you there).  I only go there about twice or three times a year, but it certainly isn't because it isn't delicious.  Definitely looking forward to it this year!

A Saturday morning breakfast at Crackers--or Crack Whores as my uncle and I jokingly and lovingly refer to our favorite breakfast place--is soooo filling.  I also like to order from the lunch menu as well (if we go after 10am)...cream of spinach and artichoke soup!  the drunken chicken sandwich! the spinach salad (with green apples)!  Hidden in an industrial complex off of Country Club in Mesa, Crackers & Co is a great place to meet, a great place to take people, and has a surprisingly mild wait--even at weekend brunch time (the longest I've waited is about 20min...mostly there's no wait at all the farther from noon you get)  Ask for the fries well done and the spicy mayonnaise!

With family in upstate New York, I grew up with trips to Ted's while visiting back east.  The charcoal grilled hot dogs always tasted sooo good.    In high school, I discovered that Ted's had a location in Tempe, only a bit away from my parent's house in Mesa.  The yumminess of the food definitely translated west of the Mississippi.  Everything is so good and has that awesome taste of being grilled and perhaps fried (like the fries and onion rings)  without being too heavy.  I love standing in line, calling out my order when asked, buying Weber's mustard (I haven't found it sold anywhere else in Arizona), drinking fountain rootbeer that has a kick, looking at the Buffalo, NY paraphenalia that decorates the walls.   On the trays, there is a paper with a quiz that I pretty much have memorized.  I know, from the quiz, that Ted's uses 7 million pickle spears per year.  I also always laugh with my friends over the easiest question on the quiz: "True or False; there is a Ted's Hotdogs location in Tempe, AZ" (the quiz was clearly written for my Ted's friends to the east).  It gets pretty crowded at lunchtime and stays that way through the afternoon.  I would suggest going slightly before noon or after 2:30pm.

I had been hearing about the perfect consistency of Aiello's crust for THREE YEARS before I got to try it for myself.  That's a lot of build up for pizza.  LUCKILY, Aiello's is completely deserving of that much build-up.  It is absolutely delicious.  I begged to go there every single night for the week I was in Pittsburgh, and mostly was obliged.  (Aiello's is open late--2am, so it's the perfect place to go not only for lunch or a casual dinner, but also late night--especially after some tasty PA beer is in my belly).  The staff couldn't be more nice.  Everyone goes out of their way to meet you, know you, and provide a great pizza chomping atmosphere.  This is one of the few places in the world where ordering plain cheese is amazingly delicious and satisfying.  Order it "off the top" for a slice heated to perfection, but not too steamy...believe me, if you get it too hot, you will burn your mouth after not being able to wait for it to cool to taste your slice.  It's going to drive me crazy not being able to have Aiello's all the time.  I guess I have to plan more trips to Pittsburgh.  PS: Crazy inexpensive (!!!) CASH ONLY

The best thing by far about the Lutheran Thrift Shop is that they always seem to have the most adorable bags, purses, and clutches.   While their vintage clothing and shoe selection is fun as well, I have always had the best luck with adorable little vintage clutches.  The women who work there (mostly little old ladies-adorably so) are accommodating without being overbearing.  Especially while you're picking out jewelry in the front (they have a lot of fantastic old jewelry as well).  The Lutheran Thrift Shop has a wide selection-including some furniture and household items-without being so big that it becomes junky.  The prices are right for the second hand finds.  Lastly, it must be said, that it is clean.  I can't stand a messy second hand/vintage/thrift store.

I was looking forward to trying a new sushi place in my hometown of Mesa, Arizona.  Mesa isn't my favorite place to eat...for multiple reasons, but since my parents still live there, I've learned to find some good standards.  I thought I was going to find another in Got Sushi...not the case.  The setting was sub par...way sub par.  The service was okay.  The sushi was not good...and I had a pretty ferocious stomach ache afterward and the day after as well...I blame the sauces used, particularly on the J.J. Roll.    It just wasn't good.  Definitely disappointing.  We should have just gone to Red, White, & Brew (a personal favorite) which is right next door.

Red White & Brew...oh, how un-Mesa of you to exist...  Sometimes I call RW&B the only real restaurant in Mesa, but that's usually when I'm being a bit snarky over the fact that it feels like (or in most cases, not only "feels like" but is completely true) every single thing out there is closed down by 8pm.  There's also a big lack of non-chain-non-crappy dive-restaurants in Mesa.  Red White & Brew fits the bill for a spot to grab dinner with my parents when I visit them.  This is usually how the RW&B experience plays out: My mother and I go to dinner.  I get an iced tea, she gets a diet coke.  We devour the yummy garlic-y buttery rolls (note: extremely uncharacteristic of my mother to "devour" anything, let alone something described as "buttery"...I told you, this place is magic).  I order the French Onion soup (SO DELICIOUS, my favorite place to get French Onion Soup).  I also order the coconut shrimp with mashed potatoes and steamed veggies.  My mother eats the shrimp (so big, so good, so juicy--totally makes me miss seafood) and  I eat the sides.  We commence with deep conversation over various topics: Sex, Politics, My Sister, Our Family...my mother and I are very close, but especially over dinners here do we have some great conversation.  We take the leftovers home to my dad or sometimes order to-go for him and my sister.  The experience of course varies depending on who I'm with, but the experience is definitely always good.  I always leave extremely full...even if I just eat a little bit (I think it's because I always drink so much tea).    PS Wide Beer and Wine selections along with the full bar.  Seasonal imports from far away places (like Nicaragua) and AZ Microbrew favorites of my father's.  PPS Now there's a second location in very South Chandler.

Let's state the facts: AZ 88 has seemed really cool for some years now, but when my freshman roommate and I first discovered it we weren't old enough to get in past 7pm (it's a lounge at dark, and they card).  Having forgotten about AZ 88 for a few years, I suddenly remembered it this Thanksgiving when my friend Jessica and I were both in our hometown (Mesa, AZ) and were going to get together to catch up.  AZ 88 is not in Mesa (anyone from Arizona would find that assumption laughable) but it is in Scottsdale, which is only a short drive from our parent's East Mesa abodes.  We parked in a lot in Old Town and walked the short distance (though kind of tucked away) to AZ 88.  The bouncer at the door looked...classy...I think that's the best way to describe it.  Dressed in all black, including gloves and a coat.  He took our IDs and granted us entrance.      It was full of people, but not crowded a Christmas-Tree shaped structure which once you get close you realize is completely covered in one dollar bills was the centerpiece of the room.  There is also outdoor seating, but there was a light rain the night we went, so it was not open.  A man who opened the door for us (seemingly a manager just on his way in) asked if we'd like a table and swiftly led us right to one; a perfect little semi-circle booth up against the 'tree' with another semi-plush chair pulled up.  The girls (Jess and I) slid into the booth and Ben, who was also with us, took the chair.  We ordered drinks and since Ben and I had eaten neither lunch nor dinner (big mistake of a busy day) we also ordered the Hell's Fire Chips and  Dipping Fries (main picture).  The food was good, I only didn't like the Hell's Fire Chips as much because I'm not a huge fan of bleu cheese.  The drinks were strong and good.  The dining area was filled with people  of all ages (well, all ages over 21).  There also seemed to be a large presence of seemingly foreign born people speaking in accents and other languages (which is always nice when you've spent your weekend in vanilla Mesa).  The bathroom is intense.  First of all, we had trouble finding it...and almost found ourselves in the kitchen, until a server directed us in the right direction.  At first glance, you can't tell that the large panels are doors--only marked at the bottom with a pink block of color and reading "SHE."  The bathrooms are all mirrors and at the bottom of the sink area there is a small cutout so that a portion of the dining room can see the legs of whoever is washing her hands.  It was very interesting, and kind of funny.  The whole place sparks with groups and fun conversation.  I will definitely go back to AZ 88 when I'm in the mood for a nice dining and drinking experience in an atmosphere that is a little more electric than most.  My only concern is they had a card tucked into the menu that had a Ronald Reagan quote...a particularly bourgeois one too--about money buying memories--disturbing.

A few of my favorite things about Delux: -It's open LATE (2am every single night) -SWEET POTATO FRIES!  They are nice and crispy.  I always order the mixed fries (regular and sweet potato mixed together and served in a mini shopping cart) -The blue lighting (under the table and around the small restaurant/bar) which gives the whole place a soothing, yet vibrant blue glow. -Wide selection of Martinis (I would love it more if they weren't at least $11 each, but that's definitely standard for a specialty martini). -Bar setting without carding at the door (then no one gets excluded from delicious food just because they aren't old enough to drink). -Dessert: Mmmm Chocolate  Delux is one of my favorite places to take someone when I want to hop out of the ASU Tempe area (over to Phoenix), but don't want to go too far.   I love the long, slightly higher table with stools (but not as high as a high top) that runs down the center of Delux.  It's always fun to sit next to interesting people and strike up (even brief) conversations as you wait for your food.  The bathrooms are two dark individual rooms (both unisex) with a sink and vanity area between them.  They have bead curtains around the urinals which was a nice was to add some glitz.

I'm sorry...but no thanks.  Growing up in East Mesa, when Tia Rosa's opened it soon (for some reason) became the go-to "nice" Mexican spot.  I'm not sure why...the food is about on par or below the standard of most Mexican food that one can other wise find in Mesa.  I don't understand the obsession.  All of my memories of Tia Rosa's are attached to one overriding theme:  Waiting.  On a Tuesday or other week night it is not uncommon to wait over an hour (say an hour and 40 min) for a table.  There really isn't a good area or bar to wait either.  Then it's the waiting for a server to come.  Then it's the LONG wait for food.  Why all the waiting for something that's not even that fantastic??

Cibo!  I found Cibo last summer when I was looking for a relaxed place to meet my grandfather for dinner.  With seasons tickets to the Diamondbacks he can meet me at Cibo for dinner before he catches a night game.  I love Cibo's location in downtown Phoenix.  I love that it's in an old house.  I love the staff--so welcoming.  My grandfather is a little disappointed that they only serve wine and beer so that he can't get a gin and tonic, but I like sitting at the bar and drinking a slow glass of wine.  The food has always been delicious (we're pretty snobby when it comes to any kind of Italian fare...)

Fez is RIGHT down the street from where I work, hence due to its location + general fabulousness, it has become a regular spot for happy hour.  Here's What we LOVE about Fez: -Sweet Potato Fries (sooo good--sprinkled with cinnamon by the way) -Kisra and Hummus! -The Black Bean Burger (the first time I ordered it, I asked the server: "Now, is this one of those really bad black bean burgers or does it actually taste good?"  She said, "I totally know what you mean, no this one is good."-and she was right!) -Margarita Mondays (aka 2 for one Margaritas--check out the pomegranate one!!) -The atmosphere--blue and green tones while still being warm -The friendly service -The close proximity to light rail  Here's what we don't like as much: -The slow service (sometimes it gets kind of bad, I feel like you have to be an active restaurant goer and hail down your server--otherwise you may never get to order, get more water/another drink, or get your check) -When happy hour ends (I mean, who likes that anywhere?)  Fez makes me very happy to work in downtown Phoenix.

Since breakfast isn't my favorite meal to eat out (I like to eat as soon as I get up...breakfast is yummy just rolled out of bed), I had not tried, but  only been hearing raves about Matt's Big Breakfast for literally about a year, so I knew it had to be good...good enough to try breaking my fast outside my own kitchen.  Luckily it wasn't too crowded (as I'd heard it might be).  We were seated at a window counter, but then moved once our food came to a little table by the door.  The staff was ultimately accommodating to the best experience for us.   The food was beyond delicious.  Egg salad sandwich with chips (I told you I wasn't a huge breakfast-out person), a waffle, and potatoes, and chocolate milk.  It was all SO delicious!  And SO MUCH!  We were able to take most of the sandwich home for later.  By the way, the break was AMAZING...just amazing.  My favorite thing I think (besides the food) was how friendly everyone was--from the staff to the customers.  It also was cool because since Matt's is small (but not too small), you wind up talking to the people around you.  Three tables joined in our conversation to complain about State Senator Russel Pearce, who led the slaughter of AZ's education budgets particularly in Spring 2009...but that's a different story...  I need to go back to Matt's soon--it was a great time.

I liked it here.  I had wanted to go for a long time with one of my best restaurant companions, but I wound up going with four of my girlfriends from high school during a 'summer kick-off resort weekend' (yes, we actually did that...wow, that's hilarious to type) in Scottsdale.   Anyway...as I said, I liked it.  I don't think my friends were as in love.  Not all of them drink (so they weren't impressed by the awesome wine selection--I had a glass of a delicious White Knight), and not all of them quite understood the concept of tapas...to order lots of little dishes to create a full meal.  The four of them were very frustrated with how little food they could get for their dollar.  One girl ordered a salad which turned out to be essentially three leaves of lettuce. To be fair to these girls, the tapas were particularly small...really really yummy, but very small.  Ultimately, it would have been better for us to go somewhere else, but I would completely want to go back to Tapino and experience it with some wine lovers and some people that understand the tapas concept...and some other friends who are willing to expand their restaurant horizons beyond Applebees.  I would especially love to sit on all white couches on the all white tented patio, it looked so relaxing.  However, one complaint.  I frown on tapas restaurants that use their status as such as excuse of having way way way too small food portions...while the rest was delicious and adequate (the corn dogs were especially savory), the three leaf salad had Tapino walking that line...so I'm definitely putting it on warning for this near infraction.

Going to Camelview is definitely a positive way to spend an evening.  Its retro (because it's old) neon lights and blue building exterior make me want to put on a casual dress, grab a clutch, and have a date at the movies.  I would like it if they sometimes had later showings, but other than that it's a great place to go see a film that maybe isn't out (yet or ever) in other theaters around the valley.  On the walls are painted murals of award winning or iconic movies (like a big shot of the classic scene from The Graduate with Dustin Hoffman).  The actual theaters aren't stadium style, but it's never been a problem for me or anyone else I've gone with to see the screen, even when it's crowded.

Definitely my go-to lunch spot on Mill.  It has always worked for my purposes: quick dinner with visiting parents, business lunch, date.  Parking is easy since it's right above the 6th Street underground parking.  They have a couple of vegetarian options for my herbivores, some hardcore meat options for my carnivores, and some delicious soups for those who don't want a sandwich.    I've pretty much tried every sandwich on the menu and they are all really great.  My favorite lately has been the grilled peanut butter and jelly on dark rye.   A great deal is to get 1/2 sandwich & 1/2 soup for about $7.  The 1/2 sandwich is always too big for me and I usually take half of it home to be savored later.  This all comes with chips as well.  I wish the potato soup didn't have bacon in it, but oh-well...it's good if you're ok with bacon.  The service can be sporadic and you don't always get the most friendly of servers, but it is basically a bar, so it's doable.   Definitely decent drink specials.  The chips and salsa are REALLY GOOD.  Ahh, to be in Arizona where there is good salsa even at non-Mexican and non-Spanish restaurants...

The best part about the 16th Street Sports Bar and Grill is the Trivia.  Tuesday and Friday nights.  The entertainment and light (unless you go with my father, then it's heavy) competition of the Team Trivia (this spot specifically has been featured in the College Times for its stellar trivia) is enough to make me sit through the not-so-great bar food (but hey, it's BAR food--it's basically supposed to be not-so-great).  Favorites: curly fries, potato skins (without bacon)...and the wings are good too!  The drinks are great, lots of beers available (always a good seasonal bottle around) .  It's a fun, loud, crowd---and seriously, the trivia is awesome.  16th Street Sports Bar and Grill has all the the fun of a dive bar while the bathrooms maintain the cleanliness of someplace perhaps more trendy.  Get there early on Trivia nights--the place can pack up, and you want to make sure you're in the game!

Remember how I said that the Trivia was the best thing about this place?  Well, they got rid of long time Triva host, Dave (who had been featured in the College Times and was the best thing about the trivia).  Without Dave's personality, this place just doesn't cut it.  Will never go here again. Bummer.

Tanked Fish is really fantastic.  I don't go to Awatukee much (except to visit my Aunt and Uncle who live there) and expected it to be far, but I was surprised how close it was (only about 10min from Mill Avenue in Tempe).  The sushi tastes good.  The edamame is delicious and an order is big enough to share. There's other things on the menu for non-fish lovers (but the primary fare is sushi).  I was shocked by the warm and dare I say (at the expense of sounding like my mother) "hip" setting.  A giant light structure stretches across the ceiling to illuminate the place with a nice glow.  The music (streamed music videos over flat screens) can be a little loud, but in general it's really good and doesn't get in the way of conversation.  There was one night they played some weird metal that I wasn't very familiar with (and kind of harsh for dinner music), but that's the only time the music has disappointed me.  BEST PART: Tuesday & Thursday ALL DAY Happy Hour!  Almost all the sushi is 1/2 off, all appetizers 1/2 off, great drink specials.  It's basically amazing considering how great this place is.  Desserts are fantastic as well (mmm...chocolate cake). and did I mention they have SWEET POTATO FRIES???  Now, I love that :)  Service is extremely helpful & friendly.  PLUS it's open late

Made is my favorite place to go whenever I go to First Fridays (monthly art walk) in Phoenix.  I realize that I could go there at other times during the month, but there's something special about saving it as a once-a-month only event.  If, however, you prefer to not be crammed into the small shop, burning up from the body heat inside (no matter the weather outside) you perhaps should visit on a day that is not the First Friday of a month.  I Love Made's selection of quirky books, curious items that might improve your household (like the little man statuette that now holds my razor in the shower), specialty magazines, and hilarious independently printed "propaganda" (like instruction books on how to be "American" set up like boyscout training manuals).  The stuff in Made is generally higher quality than the stuff sold on the streets at First Fridays, and can be more or less expensive depending on what you're getting.  All my individual purchases there have been under $10, but that's because I haven't brought myself to buy a very cute looking $40 cosmetics bag made out of starburst wrappers.

When I asked my dad what he was most looking forward to in retirement, amongst his list he included, "Saving money by not paying for lunch in the cafeteria."  My father for the past 33 years had worked at a Junior High School in Mesa, Arizona.  I laughed, asking him how much he possibly could have paid for lunch in the school's cafeteria.  He told me, "around three dollars," and I good-naturedly teased him and we had a good laugh over the fact that there was no restaurant in the world where he would find a better lunch deal.  This was BEFORE I knew about the Zaw's lunch special.  Far from Mesa, AZ, on Murray Ave. in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh, PA you will find the most delicious Chinese Mandarin food you have ever tasted.  Zaw's lunch special includes full meals for less than three dollars.  How is this even possible??  For those of you cynics thinking that the portions must be ridiculously small, or the food be not tasty--I assure you, neither is the case.  Sonny, the owner/manager (we are not sure, but he's been around a long time) goes out of his way to shake your hand, learn your name, and remember it--even if you haven't been in for multiple years!  Marvin, the cook who speaks less English is just as friendly if not as verbal as he whips up sesame tofu, rice, lemon chicken, Szechuan eggplant, and a variety of other dishes.  This is the kind of greasy-hole-in-the-wall Chinese that actually isn't greasy at all--that's my kind of Chinese food!  It will however satisfy your cravings that sometimes only greasy-hole-in-the-wall Chinese can alleviate.   Go here for the lunch special.  Go here for a good time.  Go here to meet Sonny and Marvin. Go here for good food.  Bottom line: Go here.  Just to let you know: Cash only, no delivery, limited seating (get it as take-out, or eat it on the stoop next door and people watch Murray Ave.)

I had heard just a little bit about St. Francis before planning my visit, but everything I had heard had been so good I knew it was on the top of my list of new places to try.  St. Francis may have even exceeded my high expectations.  We got there just after 5:30pm--able to park and walk from a friend's house in the neighborhood across the street.  The other member of our party had warned us she was going to be a little late.  Initially the hostess wouldn't seat us until our whole party arrived, so we got a drink at the bar--fun indoor/outdoor set up.  Bar food = amazing...can anyone say on-the-house dishes of olives, house-made chips, toasted nuts, and thin-crust cheese pizza.  The drinks were also good.  A nicely made, strong gin and tonic.  When I ordered it with extra lime, they gave me three pieces--good sign.    Toward 6pm, just as things started to fill up (they only take reservations for 6 or more, and its very popular), the hostess approached me, confirmed that the other members of my party were close on their way, and seated us--so nice.  The food was incredibly savory--AMAZING.  Since we had already sampled the pizza at the bar, we ordered the baked goat cheese with tomatoes and pesto, and the ahi-tuna sandwich to share.  Our friend ordered a burger which looked delicious.  Chips (which were yummy) and pickled veggies (which were admittedly not the tastiest to me) came with the dishes.  I am still craving the ahi-tuna sandwich.  It was a thick ahi-steak cooked perfectly to melt in your mouth perfection.  It was on a perfect, buttery roll...it had a drizzle of aioli.  I can't get it out of my mind and a part of me wishes I wouldn't have shared (even though it was certainly large enough).  I'm dragging everyone I know here asap.  So delicious, friendly staff, relaxed environment, and great building.    Extra information: The building is two stories, it opens at 4pm (no lunch, damn), and there is a little kids meal for all you hip parents with free meals for little ones.

I don't usually review chain restaurants, but chain restaurants usually don't offer affordable, organic, delicious selections--especially without being too pretentious about it.   Jason's is just that place.  One of my best friends turned me on to it a few years ago and now it is the go-to for a healthy, inexpensive lunch that feels like a taste-bud splurge.  The thing about Jason's is that while it is environmentally responsible as well as body-responsible you don't have to compromise your deli experience in the process of all this responsibility.  If I took my dad here (a usual litmus test for whether or not something is too hippy dippy) he would just think it was a normal, cool deli with good food.    EXTRA PLUS:  -Complimentary bran and corn muffins, crackers, garlic bread, and soft serve frozen yogurt  Order at the counter, but get served wherever you pick to sit.  It gets a little crowded at lunch time, but I'm always amazed with how smoothly and quickly the line and fresh food preparation goes.  They also deliver and cater...going to try to make myself remember that for the next work function where we order out.

Three of my girlfriends and I went to Sabuddy for a going away dinner for myself (I was leaving the country for three weeks).  I had picked the place hearing that the food was really good.  I described it as "real pita" on our drive there.  Definitely more authentic than most pita places and everything was very flavorful.   We got there 20min before it was closing, but the attractive Israeli waiter (obviously recognizing that we were four hot young ladies) invited us to sit down. We chose an undressed table at the end of the restaurant, up against the large half circle window that covers nearly the entire wall facing Shea Boulevard.  The entire dinner (which was delicious by the way) was filled with loud laughter, (hardly) whispered comments about our attractive waiter, and wonderful sparks of wisdom like the newly coined Ganem Proverb: "Falafel is Falafel." We felt as if we had entered a vortex in which all of us had lost all of our social skills and made complete asses of ourselves in front of the cute waiter (who offered to take our picture at the end of the meal, but declined to allow us to take a picture of him...yeah, that was the least of the awkwardness...).

My friends kidnapped me for my birthday (yes, because they are wonderful), threw me in the back of my friend Jill's van and rushed me off (blindfolded of course) to Radio Milano.  My friend Lindsay knew I had been dying to go there (I love Postino--same owner and across the street--so I just knew Radio Milano was going to be amazing).  I've never met the man that owns these restaurants: La Grande Orange, Postino, Radio Milano etc (Lindsay apparently once did, lucky girl) but whoever he is, he is a business genius.   The atmosphere of Radio Milano was sophisticated and classy without being uptight.  Everyone was extraordinarily nice and helpful.  True to form for this restaurateur's style, there is a large vase of (fresh every day) flowers that compliment the warm glow of the restaurant in general.  Our server welcomed us with what were presented as "Italian Potato Chips" and a delicious dipping sauce.    The homemade ginger ale is so strong in taste, really good.  I ordered the special for the night which was a vegetable lasagna.  It was soooooo good.    I'm glad I have such awesome friends to kidnap me and take me to great places.

Birthday Breakfast with my roommates.  I had never been to Palatte, only heard of its greatness.  I must say, it did not disappoint.  I'm usually not a big out-to-eat breakfast person.  I don't like to eat heavily in the mornings and figure that any meal that I am dressed for that occurs at or after 10am falls into the category of lunch (which is probably why I got a sandwich--the skinny sandwich, delicious vegetarian sandwich with seemingly on-site made potato chips and fresh fruit).  At first, my roommates and I were confused as to how we were supposed to order, and worried that we weren't "cool" or "hip" enough that early in the morning (9am=early for a Sunday) to function at this hipster French cottage amongst the clearly hipster crowd complete with lone young guitarist in sunglasses singing a cover of "Viva La Vida" and Johnny Cash songs.  We later determined that it was because we looked to cool and hipster like (right) that no one directed us as to how to order...assuming we frequented this delightful spot located in an old house in downtown Phoenix.  Just grab a menu (in metal folders at the door) and order at the counter.  The cash register will compliment you, the staff was friendly and tentative to our tap water needs (usually not found in order-at-the counter places).  The setting was cozy (we sat inside at an oversized farm kitchen table), but when I went to find the bathroom, I discovered how expansive the property really is.  There are at least three rooms inside in which to eat and the whole house is surrounded by patio and garden space for those who enjoy eating outside.  I recommend ordering just about anything on the menu.  Everything I tasted (between my roommates and I and the sweet potato pancakes we got for the table) was immaculate.  The whole place was relaxed, not too crowded, and although there definitely was a hint of Phoenix 'Of course I know where all the cool spots in the valley are..don't you?' crowd there, it was without snobbery and there was definitely a variety of patrons (from young to old and style-wise).  My roommates appreciated the deliciousness.  Jill, who once lived in France thought it was comparable to some of the country places she had breakfasted there (but of course in the middle of a major metropolitan area).  I can't wait to bring people here for a good brunch or lunch experience.

Oh my goodness, Ice Cream Cookie Sandwiches!  And again...Oh my goodness, Ice Cream Cookie Sandwiches!  And not just plain old ice cream cookies---giant, homemade cookies--a few different types.  And you get to pick which cookies you want (you can mix them too!) and then have them fill them with your selection of ice cream (did somebody say rocky road??)  This is my favorite dessert recommendation for Mill Avenue...actually, this might be my favorite dessert recommendation for Tempe.  It's unpretentious, friendly, delicious, and you can't eat the ice cream cookies without getting a little messy (which I think is a plus--not *too* messy of course).

The Event:  Staff Party for work  -a.k.a.- the best people in the world getting together to share food, drinks, conversation, and secret santa gifts before people start using their vacation days for the holidays (8 people attending).  The Setting: District, in the Sheraton Hotel, Downtown Phoenix -a.k.a.- Very nice in the non-hotel bar/restaurant-y type of way (important).  High top tables for groups, regular height tables for smaller parties. Large, long, space. The tops of the high tops were incredibly tiny which wasn't so good when the food was ordered as all the food comes on these rather large (unnecessarily large for how small the actual food items are) wooden block platters and all of the bowls are unevenly shaped for visual affect (or just to screw with you, not sure...).  This just caused us to be clumsy when trying to maneuver dishes or hand the waitress any empty glasses...if any of us had gotten more than just lightheaded (the price of the drinks, even if I didn't have to pay for them deterred that) it would have been disastrous.    The Drinks:  Amazing, delicious peach sangria ($3.75 on happy hour...which lasts until only 6pm), great wine flights including a "Bubbly Flight" of two yummy champagnes (and one not so much); fruit flavored beers. -a.k.a.- It's not the cheapest spot ever, and it's not as if the drinks are amazingly intricate or overly delicious to make up for the price.  Not crazy expensive, but we certainly won't be making this place our usual happy hour spot.  The Food: "Small Plates" (first round: the golden calamari, the AZ Sweet Shrimp Po'Boy sliders, two orders of steamed mussels, the cheese plate, the house chips and dips, the sweet potato tater tots (mmmm!), the crabcakes.  second round (we were still hungry): another cheese plate and another order of the house chips and dip) Dessert (still hungry): raspberry cobbler (VERY TART!), The brownie fudge Sundae (very tiny), and the key lime pie (I'm not a fan of this pie in general, so I won't judge). -a.k.a.- I said it there (whispered to my friend next to me) and I'll say it now: Cheese plate = Charlie Brown's Thanksgiving.  Yep, there was actually popcorn on it.  Popcorn and Ritz Crackers...no lie.  It wouldn't be so bad if the popcorn and Ritz Crackers weren't the best thing on the plate (if not the best thing on the table).  The Tater Tots, however, were GOOD, and the house chips and dips were bearable (but only when dipped in the sauce that came with the tater tots).  The desserts were amateur...I like simple dishes, but I also like not feeling as if I could make something better than the chef.  Not a very wide selection, definitely not enough to call it tapas and make a meal (without ordering the same dish twice).  Also noticed that there were very few (very few) vegetarian options.  The Service:  Our server was very nice.  All the female servers wear these little short black skirts with an awkward (considering the setting and the placement of it) long slit up the front.  Not the most attentive, but not negligent. -a.k.a.-Less than I expect from a night out.  Overall: Probably won't be going back there, but wouldn't be overly pissed if someone suggested it...especially if they wanted to pay for my drinks and then go for a real (non-popcorn) dinner afterward.

This place is kind of perfect.  Sitting right behind the post office on Mill,  Dog 2 Go is a special hot dog stand,  dry goods, beer and wine shop hybrid.    There's a counter if you want to eat in (it seats only two or three--this place is designed mostly for take-out) and lots of stuff to buy (Arizona State University gear, beer, wine, chips, pickles out of a jar, etc.) if you want to take out.  The styles of hot dogs are written on what appears to be a big chalk board behind the counter.  They even serve veggie dogs!--Yayyy!  With a choice between poppy or sesame seeds on your hot dog bun (sesame, obviously)--a bunch of toppings, and good deals on hot dog-drink-chip combos, Thirsty Dog 2 Go is definitely a (relatively) new favorite on Mill.  Remember that parking is free behind the building for a half hour for patrons!

I was so hungry after attempting to waste time downtown between meetings (aka window shopping).  I wanted to treat myself to lunch, but did not want a super long wait (it was lunch time), and also didn't want to drop a ton of cash...and I wanted something delicious!  That's when I remembered that I had heard great things about America's Taco Shop (America, by the way is the name of one of the owners, it is not a reference to our continent).  It seems everyone has been hearing great things about America's Taco Shop--I even heard some guys there talking about how it really has blown up (thanks to yelp and news reviews) and that there even is another location in the works.  I got a bean and cheese no-lard (good!) burrito.  I got the regular size which was perfect and chips and salsa.  It was SO GOOD...creamy bean and cheese...mmm...I really should not write reviews while I'm hungry...I'm too tempted to go down there immediately...anyway...  The prices are great, the salsa is to die for (spicy, pureed almost, really great--perfect on the chips).  There wasn't a crazy line (though I make no promises, this place is popular and there was a longer line when I left).  Parking was slightly cramped, but especially decent for downtown.  There is seating outside on a fun large patio enclosure.  You order at the counter and the food is brought to you.  It's a great place to go and eat Mexican food without feeling like you just blew your morning at the gym...that is, unless you overeat by ordering every item on the menu--which you might be tempted to do, everything's so good.

I always run into the same old friends in Downtown Phoenix.  This always reminds me how (though MASSIVE) the city of Phoenix has this little niche downtown where everyone seems to know everyone.  Somehow, even in the midst of everyone knowing everyone, there are always restaurants to share at these happenstance meetings.  For example, I had somehow never heard of Hanny's up until this point.  My friend assured me that I had to try it out.  I am so glad I did!  I went there the first time for lunch and was immediately enamored with the space.  The elements are mostly square and granite gray with a large square bar in the center of the first floor dining area.  The gray is not cold, but cool and inviting.  At the bar, they cut fresh prosciutto (which, though my pescatarian mouth will not be tasting it, I can still appreciate).  The food was filling and tasty.  A deliciously seasoned portabella mushroom sandwich and a Hanny's salad (served at an enormous portion) are my favorites.  The sandwiches come with onion crispies which is kind of a guilty pleasure.  An elevator as well as stairs lead up to the upstairs loft.  An old elevator shaft next to the functioning elevator (the building was build some time in the 1940s I believe) has been cleared out and glass installed so you can get quite an endless view which adds even more character and enjoyment to the place.  There is a second bar upstairs and more dining space.  HOWEVER, my favorite part of the upstairs are the bathrooms.  You walk through a narrowing mirrored passage into an oval shaped room.  You might not even notice that there are doors all around you, but the waitstaff has told you to "push" on one of the walls.  The whole room is paneled with while doors that at first glance just appear to be part of the wall.  Each is a separate bathroom (so gender neutral, which is great).  The whole upstairs is a bit like being Alice falling down the rabbit hole (in a good way).  Come here for a nice lunch or at night if you want to treat it fancy and get semi-dressed up (which the mood would certainly allow--I want to host a dinner here!).

There is certainly a certain amount of novelty attached to Yogurtini.    It's a little bit Jetsons as you pass the clear (glass or fiberglass, I don't know) floor to ceiling panel, grab a bowl and select your ice cream from multiple soft-serve dispensers on the wall.   There are a variety of flavors and a little mini cups to taste ones you want to try.    Then come the toppings! It is far too hard for me not to resist getting chocolate ice cream and then smothering it with chocolate-y and candy treats.  There is also fresh fruit for people who have stronger wills than me when it comes to chocolate.  The whole concept is that you fill up on ice cream and toppings and then weigh your bowl at the end...charged by the ounce.  It's not a bad plan...but then again, there is a certain novelty to it...so hopefully the novelty won't wear off.  The interior is mostly mint green and the inside seating seems very mod patio-furniture, but the multiple toppings, multiple ice cream flavors, and not too horrible of a price (since you usually can estimate the weight of your own bowl) make it okay.  I couldn't go here every week (but I'm not a super ice cream person), but it is a nice treat!  Oh, ps, I guess I've been calling it ice cream, but it's technically frozen yogurt...it's frozen...and in my book, unless it's gelato, it's all ice cream to me!

Posh Nails is just around the corner from my parents' house.  I didn't realize how great it was until in a pinch I had to go get a manicure in a hurry.  The inside of Posh Nails is clean and well put together.  New release movies are always playing on a big flat screen tv mounted at one end of the room.  A basic manicure is $12 which is fairly acceptable.  I usually like to get a basic from a non-high-end salon for $10, but Posh is worth it.    The staff is very friendly and the owner is most often always there.    Lately they've really been pushing the pedicures, which actually are a fabulous deal (if only I had more time to get them more often!) A basic pedicure is $20-25 and with it you get a hot stone massage on your legs for no extra charge---which is amazing!  It seriously feel soooo good;  a major added bonus.  They always take their time and give you extra care if needed (which sometimes means that they don't understand the concept of "I have to leave for a meeting in a half an hour--can we make this work?)  All in all, I'm glad to have this neighborhood place around.  They're closed on Mondays by the way, so make sure to plan for that!

Oh Dear Restaurant Diary, I am in LOVE!  Never did I think that an independent coffee shop in central Phoenix could capture my heart in such a way!  Lola is unpretentious, bright, beautiful, and fun--I'm absolutely enamored!  The space is open (not cluttered) with multiple options of seating...all comfortable without being slouchy and sinking.  The big windows allow natural light and the somehow simultaneously ornate and clean decor creates a perfect environment sit, work, relax.  A big counter covered with goodies (a basket of fruit, multiple trays of baked goods...mmm...) makes ordering a treat for the eyes (and a treat for the tastebuds if you choose to buy some goodies!).   The bathroom.  You know, dear diary, how I am a sucker for a good bathroom.  Clean, single, big enough, proper placement of paper products, clean lines, nice, private--it's all I've ever wanted in a coffee shop bathroom!  Black tea...mmm...homemade chai tea...  I hope there will be many happy returns to dear lola...many happy returns.  Lots of love, diary, XOXO  Christina  PS Cash only (so make sure you carry)!

Taste of Tops just didn't feel like Tempe...in a good way...  My dad had cut out an article in the paper about Taste of Tops and suggested I go there when I got a chance (we both appreciate a good glass of beer).    The place is nestled in the conglomeration of shops that makes up this particular stretch of University Ave...Thai Basil...Tops Liquor...antique store...bike store...But somehow, when you enter the doors of Taste of Tops, you are transported to another place: there are people in jackets here, people who I didn't recognize (which to be honest, after years of living in Tempe, is a relief sometimes)--was it somehow colder just at this establishment's address?  It is the end of November and still disgustingly warm in the Valley of the Sun...anyway....this place just had a good vibe.   Its not huge, but its not cramped.  A big group took up the back section of booth the whole time we were there, having a great time.  The music was eclectic without being distracting.  The beer was good (and the bar staff will give you big tastes if you want to just try one before ordering), wide wide selection and not crazy expensive.  I had wanted to try something to eat but we didn't find a menu readily available and had just eaten dinner, so were not hungry enough to ask.  The servers are really nice, and even made rounds for refills (even on water) as the night wore on.  I wanted to take home and sample every bottle in the fridge in back--there were some really unique ones in there.
