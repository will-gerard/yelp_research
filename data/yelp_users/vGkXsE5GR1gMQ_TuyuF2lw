My family and I went in a few weeks ago with a gift certificate purchased from restaurant.com Nowhere in the certificate does it say that it was not valid on weekends. We had others that did state that thus the why we chose to redeem this one instead. Our certificate was for $10 off a minimum $15 purchase. Our family would have spent 3x's that amount amount easy as we are a family of 7. After we had ordered, we were told that our certificate was not valid. Even after pointing out it did not say that, Tom's would not honor it. We asked for a manager and were told that on a Saturday evening (typically a busy night in the restaurant industry) there was no manager available. We posted immediately on their Facebook page and no reply. Funny how they can reply to anyone giving a raving review but ignore and refuse to acknowledge anyone giving fair criticism.  But good news yelpers- anyone want a $10 off certificate for Tom's? I certainly won't use it. Our family will stick to Joe's Real BBQ instead.

I brought 3 pairs of shoes here on the recommendation of a co-worker. I am so glad I did. All 3 pairs were heels that needed to be re-tabbed. I dropped them off and a week later they were ready for pickup. Not only were they were re-tabbed but polished up and looking almost new. One pair are 8 years old that you would never know were that old! Shoes that would have been relegated to the trash heap including my favorite black Guess strappy sandals now have a new lease on life.  Cost is only $10 a pair and worth every penny! You will not be disappointed.

Sports Exchange was recommended to me when I son first signed up to play tackle football by another parent on the team. This was in early spring 2013. 4 seasons later and I'm a team mom to 2 teams and I am the one making the recommendation. The staff here is wonderful! They take the time with each kid and makes sure the equipment fits them properly.  When we had bought a chin strap without my sons helmet and we continued to have issues with fit, they took the time and tried several different ones before finding the one that worked. They easily could have just grabbed one and sent us on our way. They understand player safety and make sure the kids are as protected as they can with the proper equipment. Their prices are the best I've seen. We got a used helmet for under $50 and that was the most expensive equipment. Football pants new with the pads built in are $20. Used Under Armor and Nike cleats for $15 and sometimes less. You can turn in your good equipment for a credit to get new. No worries when your child has a growth spurt mid season. They have pretty much every sport and even workout equipment.  They are tucked away in the corner and easy to miss so keep an eye out. I won't go anywhere else.

This little cafe is close to my work. I had driven by it numerous times when I used to live in the area and never stopped in. Thankfully a co-worker suggested it one day. I have been a fan ever since! There has never been a time when I haven't received excellent service. Even when we tell them we are on a time crunch they have got us in and out promptly.  As for the food- I have yet to be disappointed. They have specials each month that are not to be missed.  A personal favorite of mine that is thankfully a menu staple is the Mediterranean Harvest Salad. Mixed greens with grilled chicken, kalmatta olives, radishes, tomato, cucumber, herb feta cheese. Served with pita bread. It is divine! Crackers is only open for breakfast and lunch so don't miss out. I promise you will not be disappointed!

We have been to Rachel's Bake Shop on several occasions. Considering we live in Mesa and have to drive over 30 min to get there that alone should speak volumes. The staff is friendly and always willing to make suggestions. Last visit I had a cheese Danish and it was warmed in the oven, versus just serving it. To.Die.For. It made the Danish super flaky. I have not had a bad cupcake. From the Pumpkin cheesecake one, to the Thin mint (WOW), to the plain chocolate, all have been moist and full of flavor. Sundays are double punch days and they have a table where the kids can pick a prize. My boys LOVE that.  The lunch menu is fabulous. The Buffalo Chicken Wrap is superb. From a self confessed wimp the flavor was great without being overly spicy. Was just enough spice. I highly recommend Rachel's Bake Shop.

Never again! I had left a glowing review. As a customer I have to update it.  Not much of anything is really homemade. And if it is, I can do better. Dry, from a box or thaw it out and serve it. That's not homemade and is dishonest to claim it is.  I saw some of the same things in their case as Costco. Makes me wonder.  The last few times we've been things have been dry, flavorless and just lackluster. The case has had a limited selection. It's gone down and it makes me sad to see. It had such potential. I won't waste my time on the drive or the money. I'll find a new place closer to home.

I came in to see Lindsey for a hair trial for my wedding. She did such a fabulous job I booked her on the spot.  When the big day came she arrived at my venue and styled my hair exactly like my trial. I didn't even have to show her a picture as she remembered. She did an amazing job. I have very long (nearly waist length) hair that from the sheer weight tends to not hold a curl long. Lindsey did a great job and my hair style lasted all day and night! Our wedding was in October so it was still a little warm during the day and the style held up.  I also used Kay for my makeup and she did a fantastic job. My makeup did not feel heavy on my face and did not "melt" off. I have never looked more beautiful! My makeup and even my false lashes held up through the night of dancing, pictures and crying.   The salon itself has an adorable shabby chic theme that I love! The decor is adorable without looking kitschy. There were lots of stations with plenty of stylists. The prices were not outrageous. They use Bumble and Bumble products exclusively as well.  I have found my one and only salon.

When I went in, they had a few other customers. I was seated right away. An older lady did my nails. She was very thorough, but also very slow. It took 90 minutes for a fill, so needless to say I was late coming back from my lunch. Thus the reason for the 4 star rating. Everything was very clean and they did a fabulous job. Almost a month later and I'm barely needing a fill as the color has lasted. I showed them a design from Pinterest and they duplicated it perfectly and even took their own pictures of my nails.  I received a card for 20% off my next visit that I plan on using. Total was $45 for a gel fill, polish and design which I have found to be fairly competitive in this area for a gel finish and design.

Our wedding date is fast approaching and I am so glad we chose The Elegant Barn as our venue. We looked and many other venues and they just didn't have what we were looking for. Stella and Dennis have always been approachable, upfront and great to work with. Any question I've asked I've gotten a quick answer. Any plan I have they have been willing to accommodate. I am looking forward to my big day here. It's gorgeous inside and out.

This is a fairly new store. The day I went it was not overly busy however there were a few customers. The staff was extremely helpful. I went in mainly to browse and see what they had. I was very impressed. I am a baker by hobby and I was impressed by the sheer amount of products they had. They had a great collection of cake pans, cookie cutters, fondant, carrying boxes, cupcake wrappers etc.  My only complaint is that I wish they were open on Sunday's or even later during the week. I often need items and with working full time and kids football can't get always get there when they are open. As I gear up to plan 3 kids parties in about as many weeks I know I will be here a lot.

What a cute little sushi restaurant! A co-worker decided to try this little gem out after deciding our normal spot just was too busy at lunchtime to get us in and out on time.  I'm so glad we found Sushi Kee! It's in a small shopping center and was not busy at all. There was one other customer eating when we arrived. I hope at dinner time they are busier as I'd hate to see this place close. We had originally decided on sushi until we saw the menu. They offer a bento box for $9.95. The menu gives you four columns and you chose 1 item from each column. I opted for the spicy tuna roll, cucumber salad, tempura shrimp and veggies and the teriyaki chicken. Each box also comes with a bowl of some of the best miso soup I've ever had! It had a nice smooth flavor that was not overly briny. It was garnished with tofu and small scallion slices.  My co-worker decided on the seaweed salad, crunch rolls, edemame, and the Orange chicken. We both ended up taking to go boxes with us. We received 4 pieces of sushi, a decent sized portion of the entr√©e, and my tempura came with 10 pieces! It is a lot of food for one person at well priced.  My favorite was easily the cucumber salad. Thin slices of cucumber on a soy based dressing with sesame seeds adding a nutty flavor. It was very cool and refreshing on a hot and humid August day. We saw a surf and turf roll on the menu that we both decided we wanted to come back and try. The waiter was attentive but not overly so. It has a cute Asian themed decor with lots of umbrellas. I can't wait to go back!
