Very good food! I am not sure why someone said on another review that the beans were gross. They are rich and very good. The fries are fresh. I got a pulled pork sandwich. I could not eat it all. My husband got a sausage sandwich and beans with potato salad. All was very tasty. I would recommend this place. Both of us ate for $22. Drinks and all.

I have not been to a Schlotzsky's since I moved back from Oklahoma City. There are so many other restaurants in the valley, I just never went back to Schlotzsky's. I remember when the meat on the sandwich was thicker than the bread. I don't know if the quality has declined, or if it is just this location. I ordered a turkey guacamole sandwich and the only meat on the sandwiches one little glob in the middle and that's it. I ended up throwing half of my sandwich away because it was all bread. Looking through the photos at this location, it seems that this practice is fairly consistent within all of the sandwiches that come out of there.

We had an appointment for 430 pm. The place is busy. Several more people walked in with an appointment after us and before we knew it, there were 20 people in the waiting area and our truck still had not been touched after 30 mins. I counted three workers in the service area (one just standing there) and one at the desk. I am taking an educated guess that they have over scheduled and all appointments have shown up and they are very understaffed. Well, an hour later, they came out with a list of problems with our truck and they would not be able to align it. Needless to say, we did not get our truck aligned. :-( getting a second opinion. Staff was nice, though. Lonnie is great. Sorry, Lonnie for two stars, but we are almost positive that the list of problems they gave us is overkill. Will not be back. Too many other places in Phoenix. They offer waterin the waiting area, however, the fridge does not keep it cold. It is room temperature.

Considering the lack of fast food along this stretch of road, this place is open! I have had both good and bad here. I always get the chicken strips. It really depends on the time of day as to if they are fresh and hot. 1030 am, they are fresh! I have never witnessed kids working the drive thru, always mature adults. I am sorry previous Yelpers have not had a good experience, but it has not been bad the last 5 or so times I have been here. I will continue to come back! I did not give a 5 star because sometimes my chicken is not always hot and fresh, but still good.

We have been coming here for over 3 years and have NEVER had a bad experience. We have numerous choices for Mexican food places and Popos is our first choice! Salsa is excellent, food is always hot and tasty! I recommend totally! When we don't feel like getting out, we call and order to go.

The day before one of the biggest candy holidays of the year,  and they close early, leaving many people spending their money elsewhere.  Not good business. Dozens of people just in the 5 minutes we were there were turned away with many more cars pulling trying to park. No advertisement,  no advance notice to customers driving from all over the state to shop there. I drove down from Show Low. Very disappointing.

Don't take your vehicle here unless you want to fix something other than what it's there for. If it wasn't broken before you brought it in, it will be when you leave. And it's not going to be a cheap fix. They gave me a paper with a list of problems and no estimate of cost to fix it. Reading the other reviews, looks like they may do this on purpose in order to hike the price later. Not good business, boys. And what the hell kind of place offers deals on oil changes that does not include the oil filter!?! Update: so I took my truck to a diesel mechanic. There is now, in fact, a half inch crack near the #5 injector of my diesel fuel rail. Of which is not "normal" wear and tear on a diesel truck. It's upsetting that I cannot prove that it was not leaking before we took it to Greulich. However, I know that it was not, because there is nothing on the ground under where I park my truck at home. Nevertheless, the diesel mechanic we are using is charging $300 less to fix my fuel rail.

The one good thing is that I can honestly say the staff is absolutely awesome. All very nice. If you have lots of money to spend, then this is the place. The dentist is good, but very adamant on pushing the dental implants like there is NO other option. He refuses to fill a cavity, but wants to pull the tooth and replace with an implant. Really? When all said and done, I all of a sudden had 8 cavities and needed 2 extractions and 4 implants to the tune of $15k. The only reason I went is because I had a bridge come out and needed re-cemented and my regular dentist was booked and I am headed out of town. The same tooth with the cavity he wants to pull will cost me $28 to fill with my regular dentist using my insurance. Not sure why Sonoran Sky would not use Blue Cross Blue Shield insurance in their quote. I will not go there again. They will try to push the Care Credit for all dental work. Beware, Care Credit will charge fees if not paid off within the time allotted! They are very hefty fees, too. Read the credit agreement in full!

So, we were extremely excited to eat here since it is always busy. Monday night, they offered a bag with various crab, shrimp and veggies for $25. Not a bad deal, until they brought it. You have to pay extra for potatoes, I am good with that. What I was not good with.....the veggies they charged $5 for amounted to about half a cup of broccoli and cauliflower. The potatoes I payed extra for amounted to two french fries and were raw. They did not even cook the potatoes! The crab was overcooked and shriveled with soggy shells that just bent. My husband ordered fried catfish WELL DONE. It was raw in the thickest part. Not well done. The best part of dinner was my husband's french fries. Not worth the $50+ that we spent on dinner. I am going to Joe's from now on. This place is overrated.
