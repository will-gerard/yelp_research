Stopped by Aaron Brothers for a drawing case. They didn't have the larger size I was looking for which is fine, but they didn't have much else on the shelves either.   Is this location going out of business?  You walk in and it's a disaster, unorganized tables, empty shelves and sale signs all over.   I needed help and waited 10 minutes for Peggy to ring up a woman because they were talking about their boring social lives. This woman also had several different transactions to make. Peggy, when there is another customer waiting for help, put a cork in it and do your job! At least acknowledge the next customer waiting.   Avoid this place!

Look, it's Applebee's. It's a chain. How great can it be right?  It's actually not bad at all. I only go in for late night dining, mostly for the great specials after 10PM. Many drink specials to choose from including $10 bottles of wine and half off many of their appetizers. I always sit at the bar, but the specials are available in the dining room as well.   My drink of choice is Jack Daniels and Dr. Pepper $7.50. Yes higher than a dive bar but less than a regular restaurant and it's worth every penny. They don't skimp on the Jack, so I always order a tall here.   Sometimes I will order an entree. Steaks are good, burgers are good, salads and soups are all good too.   I really enjoy this location because of the regulars who sit at the bar. Night after night you see the same people, usually stopping by to relax after work. Many are servers at other restaurants. Staff is very friendly and so are the regulars. It's almost like a Phoenix version of Cheers!  Stop by sometime!  Enjoy

I had been wanting to try Pizza Heaven for a while now and it was a huge let down!  Food was decent but not great. I didn't even get everything I ordered. When I asked our server about it, his response was "I'll take what you didn't get off the check."  Ya think?    Service was horrible. I had to help myself to their back area for a to-go box and then had to ask for the check at the register up front because our server disappeared. The place was empty!  Here is a tip server, when you don't have anyone eating in your restaurant, you should go above and beyond taking care of customers who are.    I won't be back! Too many other fantastic independent restaurants in this city to waste my time at Pizza Heaven again!

Yes this is a huge chain restaurant with locations all over the United States but this is a very good one. Every location has a very similar layout and decor, yet each one is uniquely different depending on the space or building it's located in.   The menu is the same though and the food is very good. Everything is very fresh and tastes great. It's a huge menu though which can be frustrating if you are hungry. We are talking everything from Asian to a simple hamburger. Not to worry though, you are going to like whatever you try.   My most recent visit I had the fried macaroni and cheese balls appetizer and a classic hamburger. Both were outstanding!   Staff is always friendly and if something isn't right, they will make it right with no questions asked. They can substitute just about anything on the menu as well.   Cocktails are pretty darn good too, there is a large cocktail menu as well.   You can also visit Grand Lux Cafe, Cheesecake's sister restaurant. Different menu, but just as extensive. Just as good too!  Enjoy!

Exhausted from Black Friday shopping, I needed a meat fix. Decided on lunch at a The Capital Grill Biltmore and was blown away. I had dined there a couple of times in the past but it was just special this time.  Our server Shay was outstanding. She introduced herself and immediately I knew she was going to be great. Very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. Part of what made her so great was that she shared her passion for food and cooking. Anyone can be a good server, but it takes someone like Shay with her passion to be a great server, especially in a high end restaurant.   Moving on to the food.... Shay recommended the lunch size filet with prawn scampi. Served with a choice of side, I picked the mashed potatoes.   This meal was just perfect in every way. A nice size filet and four large prawns on top. There aren't words to describe how good the scampi sauce was...garlic, butter and actually a little spicy. The mashed potatoes could not have been better, seasoned just right and made with butter and cream. I am excited just writing about it and I can't wait to go back!  Everyone in my party had the same thing and we all agreed how great this meal was.   So...Want a recommendation? Try the fillet and prawn scampi next time you are at The Capital Grill. They do it for lunch and dinner with a larger filet served for the dinner.   Enjoy!

I was here for a large party that my friend was hosting. One of her friends is Chinese so we let him have at it with the ordering. He did not disappoint nor did Super Dragon.   We started off with West Lake Beef Soup. It is very similar to egg drop soup, but with lots of minced beef, tofu and a lot of cilantro. Delicious!   For the entrees we had many different things...String beans with white garlic sauce, eggplant with garlic sauce, fried tofu, fried poor chops, crispy chicken, shrimp with walnuts, shrimp and scallops with croquets, Peking duck and West Lake Duck (West Lake Duck was ordered a couple of days in advance). Everything was really good. Shrimp and scallops with croquets and the fried pork chips were my favorites. I am a huge duck fan and this was very good, but they chop the duck here so there are too many bones to deal with.   The vegetarian entrees were very good as well. The string beans with white garlic sauce and eggplant are two vegetarian items I would order again.   I really wanted to take lots of photos of the food, but just wasn't comfortable doing so with this large group and as I said, I wasn't hosting.   The do have a bar. Service was excellent. Clean restrooms!  I will come back here for sure.   Enjoy!

I have always taken my Lexus vehicles (three of them) to Bell Lexus for service. It might cost a little more, but you aren't going to find better service, a beautiful dealership with an amazing complimentary cafe and loaner cars for any service at another place for your service needs. Bell Lexus also takes competitors coupons!  How can you go wrong? See David Bonnell...He has been my service advisor for years. Always honest and he goes above and beyond to make sure his customers are happy.  In fact, he looks for ways to save his customers money instead of trying to up sell.

Sometimes you just want breakfast at any time of the day or night, for me, this is usually between 10PM and 3AM.   IHOP is my go to for this as the food is consistent. This location needs some help though.   This location is on the dirty side! It is always under staffed when I come in here. When I say under staffed, I mean there is a cook and one server working. (This is late night, but that doesn't mean it's not busy). Get more help!   I get really grossed out by dirty dishes on the tables all around me. It's more than just clearing dirty dishes and re-setting the tables though. Is it too much to ask to wipe down the table completely and the seats as well? It sets me off when I go to sit down and there is food on my chair or booth!   I don't even want to know what the restrooms look like!  If you need an IHOP fix, keep driving a few miles to the next one! I won't return to this location again!

This is a nice little neighborhood bar tucked in the corner of a strip mall. Doesn't look like much from the outside, but the inside is very well done. Beautiful bar, wood panels, televisions with sports games, everything you would expect.   There were several people in there but it wasn't crowded. I suspect that this place can get very busy on weekends. This Monday night crowd seemed to be all regulars and people who were getting off of work nearby.   The bartender was very nice. He made a great drink and asked if I wanted a short or a tall. I am always a "short" guy when it comes to my cocktails so I really appreciated being asked.   We headed out to the nice covered patio in back. It's a small patio, but nicely done for what they had to work with (remember this is a strip mall). It was clean, had heaters if we wanted them and a large television out there with the game on.   The bartender came out to see if we needed another round. Another nice touch for a neighborhood bar.   We stayed for two cocktails and then headed home. I will certainly come back here again.   Enjoy!

I think I have found my favorite Chinese restaurant in Phoenix! Dragon Palace is everything I think of when it comes to Chinese food. The restaurant is full of traditional decorations and of course those large red booths. (They have tables too). Soft Chinese music playing in the background and some artwork.   Let's move on to the food...Dragon Palace has Mandarin and Szechuan dishes. The food is so good that I came in two weeks in a row.   We started with fried meat dumplings and crab puffs. Oh both are delicious and served with sweet and sour and hot chili sauces. We also had sizzling rice soup. One of the best Chinese soups I have ever had with chicken, shrimp and veggies. They also bring out complimentary fried wonton strips with dipping sauce to every table.   For dinner we had house special chicken which is lightly fried chicken breast sautéed in "special sauce". I don't know what this special sauce is, but I would drink it if I could. Yummy!  We also tried the sautéed happy family which is chicken, beef, shrimp, scallops and Chinese veggies all together covered in a brown sauce. Delicious! The brown sauce has a great flavor and is slightly sweet. They also don't skimp on any of the meat or seafood. I was impressed!   We did not try dessert, but they bring out complimentary banana wontons covered in honey with the check. Oh these are good!! Can I have more than one please!?  Another thing to mention is the full bar. When I go out for Chinese food I never think of ordering a cocktail. Dragon Palace had a pretty impressive cocktail menu. I didn't have a cocktail, but several people in the restaurant did and the drinks looks really good. I'll be sure to try one next time!  Enjoy!

I love this place!  I have been a few times, never disappoints. To be fair, I have only been for brunch and lunch.   This place is very popular. Make reservations!   French press coffee is excellent.  French onion soup is amazing. It's a little pricey when you consider that it's just a cup of soup, but it's worth it. Kind of hard to justify getting an entree after spending $14 on the soup though.   This time I skipped the soup and had the ham and Gruyere cheese omelet. Light, fluffy, great flavors with cream fraiche on top. Served with a small house salad and matchstick potatoes on the side. Delicious! I want one now just writing this review.   Be sure to ask for bread service. They get it fresh from an outside local bakery daily. Excellent!   Next time you are up by Kierland Commons stop by Zico Bistro!  I can't wait to try it for dinner!   Enjoy!

Pho Kim Long is another one of my Las Vegas favorites. I try to go at least once during a trip usually late at night or the wee hours of the morning.   This place is just great. Open 24/7! It's always packed no matter what time of day or night and it's not just the clever name that draws the crowds. The food is excellent.   We started out with the fresh spring rolls, fried egg rolls and the crab puffs. All were excellent, but the fresh spring rolls were the favorite.   For the main event we all had the small beef pho. Absolutely fantastic, great flavor and full of meat and noodles. I regretted not ordering the large bowl once I started eating it.   To drink I had a Thai iced tea. Delicious!   Service is excellent even when it's packed!  In Las Vegas and need a Vietnamese fix? Be sure to Pho Kim Long!  Enjoy!

There are many *****berto's in town and I have probably tried them all. It had been several years since I had been to Eriberto's and after a night of drinking and karaoke I stopped by for a late night Mexican food fix.   Everything was great. I had a carne asada burrito and three rolled tacos with guacamole and cheese. Both were really good. The carne asada burrito was huge and probably had half a pound of meat and the rolled tacos were covered in fresh guacamole and cheese. All food is served with fresh green and red salsa on the side.   It's a very casual place so don't look for fancy here, but it's very clean.    Best part is, this one is open 24 hours! Aren't all *****berto's open 24 hours you ask?  Actually no, there are several in town that are not.   Enjoy!

As a first time pet owner, I panicked when there was something wrong with my cat and I needed to find a vet fast. It's a very helpless feeling to not have a vet already when you need to take your pet in fast. Alta Vista immediately caught my eye because of their long hours and being open every day.   I called to see about bringing my cat in and was immediately comforted with the words "bring her right in."  When I arrived the lobby was empty, so my cat was taken back as soon as I filled out the new patient form.   The vet tech we first saw was very nice and took down all of my cat's general information, took her temperature, weight, etc..  She told me that a veterinarian would be in shortly to examine my cat.   After a short wait, Dr. Hendrix came in and examined my cat and told me that her symptoms indicated a urinary tract or bladder infection. He said it could be something more serious and took some blood and urine samples to be sure, but opted to treat for the lesser serious UTI/bladder infection immediately.   He gave her an antibiotic injection and we were on our way home.   Dr. Hendrix called me at home as soon as the blood results were back and again when the urine results were back. Both were normal and the antibiotics my cat was given seemed to do the trick. After about two days, she is back to normal.   Dr. Hendrix was very nice and comforting in person as well as on the phone. He also completed some pet insurance forms for me. Thank you Dr. Hendrix!   I'm glad I chose Alta Vista and will continue to take my cat there for future routine visits.

Customers beware! Dined at Thai Rama tonight. After paying with my credit card, there was a 3% credit card fee added. I was not told this when I presented my card. Bad business! I won't be back because of this!

Very nice AAA office in the Safeway shopping center. I never noticed it before and it's huge when you go inside.   I stopped in to get an international drivers license for an upcoming trip.   Very friendly staff that can take care of most travel needs. They also do vehicle registration/license plates at this office. They don't do drivers licenses though.   There is also a large retail section that has everything from luggage tags to luggage sets. Travel books galore and everything in between.   They took my photos for my IDL and I was in an out pretty quickly. I love being a AAA member!

Rio Solado or Usury Pass shooting club East Mesa is a pretty nice facility. I went with a group to check it out. Some of my friends had been there and others had not.  It a huge facility with different areas/ranges for whatever activities were going on that day. We just went to the regular public range. It is about half 100 yards and half 200 yards with a few gongs as well.   We signed our waivers, paid the $10 fee and us first timers watched a short safety video. Upon entering the range, we paired up at a shooting bench. This is NOT a great range for pairs. The benches are smaller and close together compared to the other ranges in town. The biggest problem is the targets...They are only big enough for one regular size target. So, you need to share one target or take turns between shooting sessions. Taking turns is probably the best way to go as its too difficult for two people to shoot at the same time with the small bench anyway, especially if both people are right or left handed!   I recommend the facility for East valley residents, but be sure to shoot at your own bench to make it a better experience.   All of the staff is very friendly and goes above and beyond to help.   Enjoy!

This is my "go to" Mexican restaurant in the valley. I have been eating here for 25 years and in fact, I ate here my very first night in Arizona.   Chips and salsa are always out of this world good. Made fresh daily, they serve two types. Hot and hotter! The hot is a traditional chunky tomato salsa with onions, jalapeños, cilantro, etc. The hotter salsa is smooth red chili. Both delicious and really good mixed together.   I highly recommend getting a side of guacamole to enjoy with your chips and salsa. Hands down, best homemade guacamole you will ever eat. I don't know how they do it, but I have not had better anywhere.   Their food is great. I don't have a set favorite thing so I have tried just about everything on the menu. Today I had the carne asada and enchilada. Steak was very tender and flavorful. Outstanding! Another favorite of mine is the steak fajitas.   Combinations are also a hit and they have several to choose from.  They also have lunch specials Monday-Friday.   Fried ice cream? Don't miss it. Traditionally served, coated in cinnamon crunch and honey. Mmm!  My favorite server at Los Olivos is Toni. She is very sweet and is a fantastic server. I always ask for her when I go in. Not to worry though, all the other servers are great too.   Next time you need a Mexican food fix, try Los Olivos in Old Town Scottsdale and be sure to ask for Toni!  Enjoy!

I really like this place. It originated in California where I'm from so I try to stop in here now and then when I'm in the area. There are several scattered around the valley but none in Central Phoenix.   Iced dark chocolate latte is my favorite, rain or shine! Their blended drinks are really good too!   If you get a blended drink, try it "ultimate" where they will blend in chocolate covered coffee beans. Yum!  It's usually quiet. Nice furniture. Great place to get some work done. Free wi-fi.   Enjoy!

I stop by here for one thing when I'm in Vegas...The espresso martini!  If you are an espresso martini fan, this one is a must try. No, they aren't just for dessert anymore.   For me it was the first cocktail of my day and made to perfection. It was right around brunch time so I decided to have a little snack as well.   The smoked salmon pizza was the perfect breakfast/lunch combo. Absolutely delicious pizza with fresh smoked salmon, caviar and creme fraiche.   In the past I have been to Spago for dinner and haven't been disappointed. Salads, pizza and pasta are all good.    Enjoy!

Another love/hate restaurant. I love the restaurant itself and the service is excellent. Food though is not great, looks great but the entrees are flavorless.   Loved the classy look of this place when I walked in. Nice entrance, nice furniture and traditional Chinese decor throughout. Everyone working there was very nice and took really good care of us. I was excited!  Two of us ordered Mai Tai's. They were pretty good. We had two each to make sure. Food wise we stared out with crab angels (crab puffs), pork dumplings and deep fried prawns. The crab Angels and dumplings were very good, the deep fried prawns were overly battered. The batter was too doughy and took away from the flavor of the shrimp. We couldn't finish them.   We then moved on to sizzling rice soup. It wasn't bad but didn't blow me away. The broth could have used a little more flavor.   For our entrees we ordered house special chicken, Mongolian beef and sweet and sour pork. Of the three, the Mongolian beef was the best, but didn't blow me away. House special chicken which is one of my favorites in any Chinese restaurant was just okay, very little flavor. We poured the rest of the sauce that our dumplings came with over the chicken to add flavor. Sweet and sour pork, horrible! Flavorless, not sweet or sour and again doughy like the shrimp. We left almost the entire entree on the plate.   I really wanted to like this place, but in the end it was a fail.

AZ88 in Scottsdale is the sister restaurant of Hanny's in downtown Phoenix. You guessed it, it opened in Arizona in 1988. I have been coming here since 1995 when I heard about it from my college roommate.  I have been a loyal customer ever since!  It is located in the Scottsdale Mall right by Scottsdale Center for the Arts in a large open floor plan modern building. It hasn't changed at all since I started going there in 1995 and it really doesn't need to. Simple works! Occasionally they will have an art installation that will be up for a few months.   Service is always great. Especially from a young woman named Shqipe (yes I spelled it right) that I always request. She has been taking care of me at AZ88 for years and is the best!   Let's talk about the important things, the food and drinks. Cocktails are all pretty amazing. They have a large drink menu with just about anything you can think of. Their specialty is the martinis but their cocktails are fantastic as well. One of my favorite cocktails is the champagne celebration...Champagne, chambord and peach schnapps mixed together and topped off with sugar sprinkles. Delicious!   Martinis are served in a large hand blown glass and are filled to the rim. The martinis are not cheap here though, average is $15, but well worth it.   AZ88's food is wonderful. They have great appetizers, great sandwiches, salads, amazing burgers and entrees. I always order the gallettes to start which is a flat bread sprinkled with bacon, sautéed onion, black olives and Parmesan cheese. Amazing! The chicken and bacon club is another one of my favs. I also really enjoy the AZ88 chicken salad which is basically a cobb salad with sliced buffalo chicken breast. Hot and spicy. Yaaaas! Everything they have has a uniqueness.   This review would be pages long if I kept going. Bottom line, I have not had a bad thing here ever!   Check out AZ88, you will be glad you did!  It's usually pretty busy every day of the week, Friday and Saturday though it's pretty packed so be prepared. They do not take reservations unless you have a large party but you have to call to discuss arrangements.    Enjoy!

I fully enjoyed my dining experience at Prime!  Beautiful restaurant, plush furnishings, romantic lighting, all first class. We were lucky and got a table with a fantastic view of the Bellagio fountains.   Service could not have been better. Our service team was attentive but not annoying. Everything was timed perfectly, dishes cleared properly, etc.   I started with the black and blue martini. Gin and blue cheese stuffed olives with a sprig of rosemary. It was good but the rosemary was overpowering. Gin is so aromatic already, I felt like it was ruined with the rosemary. I quickly pulled it out and enjoyed the rest.   They bring out a complimentary bread basket. Pretty basic with two types of bread and regular butter. Nothing special.   For my appetizers I had the bacon wrapped shrimp. They were absolutely delicious and cooked to perfection. I also had a wedge salad. It was good but pretty standard as far as wedge salads go. I have had better.   The steak that I ordered was great. New York strip medium rare. It was done perfectly and had great flavor. You can choose peppercorn or some type of glaze on your steak. I chose peppercorn but should have ordered it plain. They bring out three kinds of sauces with the steaks, so it's probably better to try the steak plain and add sauce on your own. It didn't disappoint though.   For sides I had baby brussels sprouts with pear and bacon (a special that night) and also had potatoes gratin. Delicious!!   Dessert was a very slight let down. I had the pumpkin creme brûlée. It was more like pumkinless creme brûlée but still good as far as a creme brûlée goes.   They have nice restrooms within the restaurant. Anyone familiar with Las Vegas restaurants knows that having restrooms within the restaurant itself is a treat. They also provide Molton Brown soap and lotion. Nice touch!   I will definitely return to Prime at Bellagio.   Enjoy!

I have wanted to try Bobby Q for years and finally had the opportunity with some friends. It's a really good place for BBQ!  I made a reservation (they get an extra shout out for being on Open Table) and it's a good thing I did. 6:15 on a Wednesday and the place was packed and many people waiting to be seated. We were promptly seated thanks to my reservation.   Our server came by to take our drink order and asked if we wanted any appetizers. Knowing what we would most likely be in for food wise, we skipped the appetizers and went right to dinner.   To drink I ordered sweet iced tea. $2.00 I love this stuff and order it wherever, whenever I can!    Though we skipped the appetizers, we did order salads which were really great, $5.50. Ranch house salad, my favorite type anywhere. Crisp lettuce, cheese, tomato, red onion and ranch dressing. Simple and delicious!   My friends split the Whole Hog Heaven platter. They could choose two kinds of ribs, two meats and three sides. They ended up ordering double ribs and double brisket. There was so much food that four people could have easily split it. $48.00  Being a prime rib fan, I had to go for it. I ordered the smoked 10oz slab $26.00. It was outstanding! I was a little afraid the smoked flavor would overpower the meat...Not at all. It was just right. My entree came with two sides so I had mac and cheese and potato salad. Both outstanding!   Dessert was tempting as mud pie was available which I would normally go for. There just wasn't room after all that food! We did however receive a complimentary bag of mini doughnuts. Served hot and dusted with cinnamon and sugar. Delicious and just right. You can take those home if you want.   Everything about our evening at Bobby Q was outstanding. We were taken very good care of by our server and management checked on us a couple of times. Special shout out to one of the managers on duty Donnie. He was very friendly and went above and beyond to make sure we were enjoying our evening. Nice touch!   Be sure to try Bobby Q! It won't disappoint! Look for the Mesa location opening soon!   Enjoy!

I LOVE this bar! It's more of a piano lounge but still a bar hence the name!  I always stop by here at least once during a Vegas trip for several reasons. One, it's very comfortable. Two, the cable car martini. Three, the caviar. Four, the cable car martini. Oops. I said the cable car martini twice. This is my favorite cocktail in the world, especially here! I usually manage to get two or three down.   This time I had the Royal Ossetra caviar. Absolutely delicious and served perfectly with all of the standard accompaniments a fine caviar should have. Caviar is a very expensive habit and this place is no exception. I'm sure there is a hefty markup, but with the comfortable atmosphere, lovely music from the piano and great service, it's worth every penny. This is also a great bar to people watch from. I could have sat there all day but needed to hit the casino to try and make the money back I spent on the 30 grams of that awesome caviar!   If you find yourself wandering the Bellagio and need a yummy cocktail, be sure to hit the Petrossian Bar for a cable car!  You won't be disappointed!  Enjoy!

If you haven't been to Rao's, you need to eat here. They have excellent Italian food and I think the majority agrees because this place is always packed!   Inside looks like an old school Italian restaurant. White linens, lots of wood furniture, the color red everywhere. The place is pretty big too!  We started out with a complimentary bread basket. Filled with several baked treats and served with three types of butter. So good, we asked for a second basket.   For the main event, we all ordered something and split it. Their food can be shared family style but it's also the right size for one person if you go that route.   We had the Caesar salad, veal Parmesan, shrimp scampi and a penne vodka. Everything was delicious!! I would have to pick the shrimp scampi as the group favorite, but I would order everything  else again.   Service is excellent. Our server was very engaging, knowledgable and helpful. If you order a pasta to be enjoyed family style, they will split it up for you table side. Nice touch!!   I highly recommend Rao's for your next Las Vegas Italian food fix!  Enjoy!

Feeney's is a great locals place that has been around for years. I only started going there a couple of years ago and had probably missed out for a long time.   When walking in, you are immediately greeted by one of the very friendly family members. We had a party of five and made a reservation on Open Table (I think all restaurants should be on Open Table by the way). Right away we were taken back to our table. Feeney's is small with several small rooms of tables so I would recommend making a reservation for any size party.   We placed our drink order, margarita for me, martinis or beer for my friends. They serve about 100 types of bottled beer and have a few on draft. This is when I made my check in on Yelp and was awarded a free potato skin appetizer. Why not!?  When our server returned with the drinks I mentioned our free appetizer. He said, "I saw you check in, I've already ordered it for you."  Nice!  For the main event three of us had the prime rib, one had the ribeye and one had fish and chips. From what she was saying, the ribeye was outstanding, she could not have been happier with it. I was told that the fish and chips was also very good. As for our prime rib, it was good but needed a little boost in flavor. Still it was a beautiful cut of meat and tender. I was the only one who had been to Feeney's before and have only had the prime rib, so obviously it was normally outstanding. As I said, the prime rib had always been good in the past, it was probably just one of those not so flavorful slabs of meat that the restaurant received. I will return and I will order the prime rib again!   Let me back up to the choices that come with entrees. Salad bar or soup and your choice of side item. I opted for the salad bar as I always do when dining there. It's a nice little salad bar with several choices of toppings. They also have several choices for your side item with a small up charge for a large twice baked potato ($2). It's very worth it!  I am not a dessert person normally, but I always get one there. The mud pie!  Coffee ice cream, Oreo cookie crust and chocolate topping. Mmm! Delicious!  All and all this is a fantastic place. Support a local family owned business and check out Feeney's. They also have daily specials!  Enjoy!

One of my favorite places in town. Lately I have gone twice a week because it's very good and they are open late.   Food is always good. Burgers, salads, sandwiches. All fantastic and a wide variety. Bruschetta or the croquettes of the day are both a must!   Sean has been my server three times in two weeks and after tonight I will ask for him when he's there. He is very attentive and works hard. Sean is probably the best server I have had in years.   Switch is a must try! Don't forget to ask for Sean and tip him well. He works hard!

This was once one of my favorite spots for a snack and a cocktail when I visit Las Vegas. After this last visit, not so much!  I went in and told the hostess I wanted to sit at the bar. She said, sure but we only have bar seating today. The lounge area was filled with tables and some kind of a business meeting going on. The comfortable sofas were all missing. Not a big deal since I wanted to sit at the bar, but I noticed the uncomfortable vibe in the room.   I pretty much hated the bartender from the beginning. She was not welcoming and clearly missed her dose of Abilify that morning. She was cold and made me feel like I was annoying her. I ordered a glass of champagne and asked for the menu. She brought me the dinner menu. I then had to ask for the cheese menu. Then I had to ask for the lunch menu! I asked why the hesitation on brining me the lunch menu? She tells me that I would have to get my order in for a lunch menu item within the next ten minutes.   Maybe she was trying to get me to order from the dinner menu because she knew how much I would hate the burger I ordered!  This was one of the worst burgers I have ever had. Flavorless! I mean try adding salt and pepper at least! This was a classic burger, nothing fancy and they managed to screw it up.   In the future I will stick with champagne and cheese at Morels. They are both excellent here...I had a second glass of bubbly to be sure!

Bar 1 is a great neighborhood bar!  It's considered a gay bar, but like most of the "gay" bars today, everyone is welcome and all kinds of people are seen there.   Bar 1 is very friendly, comfortable and clean. I would consider it upscale but not snobby by any means. They have a beautiful patio, nice living room area and the main bar has plenty of seating at tables and at the bar itself. There are two pool tables and a juke box. My advice is to leave the juke box alone and just enjoy the awesome music videos they play. Personally I think having the juke box is a mistake because as I said, their video library is awesome. If you are nice to your bartender, they will even play something that you want to hear.   Drinks are fantastic and they can make just about anything. Try one of their champagne specialties or shot of the month. Always delicious!  I am a Jack and Coke drinker and one of the things I like best about Bar 1 is they use real Coca-Cola products. Do you know how important this is?  Those knock off soda products that some bars use can almost ruin a drink!   There are various specials throughout the week...2-4-1 every Thursday. Karaoke is every Tuesday.   Be sure to check out Bar 1 you don't even have to be gay!  Enjoy!

Hanny's! I love you!  Hanny's is probably one of my favorite spots in town for anything from lunch to a late night snack. This is my number one go to at least once a week.   Everything is good here! Appetizers, sandwiches, salads, pizza...all fantastic. I always start out with the snack plate...Hanny's version of a charcuterie. (Prosciutto, salami, cheese, green and Greek olives, pistachios and bread) all for $7.00. Yes the price has gone up $2.00 since my last tip a couple of years ago.   Best thing in the house has not gone up. Ready for it?? Vodka or gin martinis are always $5.00. So are Jack and cokes! Martinis are served traditional straight up, dry or dirty with olives. Small up charge for blue cheese stuffed olives. Jack and cokes are served as a glass of Jack Daniels and a bottle of Coke on the side, you can "season" your Jack Daniels however you like.   I really love their pizza. Many to choose from, all pretty large dinner plate size on thin crust. Perfect for sharing, but I can usually finish one. My top three are the carne (sausage and pepperoni), Americano (sausage, sautéed onions and mushrooms) and the prosciutto e mella (prosciutto, apple and fontina cheese) this one doesn't have sauce. Delicious! The fontina cheese really makes this one stand out, the other pizzas are made with an Italian cheese blend.   Salads and sandwiches are good too!  Best dessert on the menu, the strawberry long cake. Yep I said long cake. It's an ice cream cake version of a strawberry short cake but probably ten times better. It's long, but I never want it to end! Yum!   Another point of interest on Hanny's is the building. It's actually an old men's clothing store. They have kept the building pretty original and it's really something to see. From the creepy basement with an art display to the individual bathrooms that are converted fitting rooms. Pretty cool place.   There is a DJ most nights of the week.   Impress your next date and bring them to Hanny's! Kitchen cooks until 1AM and bar pours until 1:30AM every night.  Enjoy!

After seeing Flavors of Louisiana on Check Please Arizona, I had to try it! It was well worth the drive to Avondale from my Central Phoenix home.   We started out with a combination appetizer. They give you the option of ordering three different appetizers in the combo because it is nearly impossible to decide on just one. We opted for the hush puppies, fried green tomatoes and fried pickles. All three were fantastic but the hush puppies were probably my favorite with the fried pickles a close second. You can choose from the many different dipping sauces they offer or have them all! We had the remoulade and Cajun ranch. The Cajun ranch was delicious!  Moving on to the main course.  We all had po boys. Several authentic entrees are offered at Flavors of Louisiana, but I am a po boy connoisseur. You can get your po boy about ten different ways there. I had the fried shrimp, my friends had fried tilapia and another had the muffuletta. I have not had a po boy this good since I was in New Orleans earlier this year!  Made in the traditional way with lettuce, tomatoes and mayonnaise on fantastic French bread. Served with a choice of sides such as potato salad, red beans and rice, cole slaw, fries, dirty rice, etc. or for $1.00 more you can get a cup of gumbo or jambalaya. I opted for the sausage gumbo (you can also choose seafood). Fantastic!!  For dessert we decided to try the beignets. They are nowhere near the ones you will find in Louisiana and have a different texture, but their version is still very good. We finished them off!  Drink selection is simple, sodas and iced tea, sweet or regular. Best sweet tea I have ever had and all you can drink!  Outstanding service!! Everyone who was working last night was very friendly. Our server Carlee was a gem. Outgoing, engaging and you can tell she really enjoys working there. The chef even came out to talk with us and to make sure we were enjoying everything.   All in all they do a fantastic job brining the "Flavors of Louisiana" to Arizona! I can't wait to go back!  Open Monday-Saturday for lunch and dinner. They are closed on Sunday.   Enjoy!

Always love going to Dutch Bros Coffee! The people who work there are always so friendly and genuinely ask how my day or night is going. This location is open 24 hours!  2:00AM? Same friendly, happy people working there.  Great coffee and a wide variety of crazy drinks from hot to frozen. Right now I'm on a French Toast latte kick.  Can't decide? They are happy to help and have great suggestions. Don't see what you like on the menu? They will make just about anything you want.  Great prices and specials all the time. You must try Dutch Bros!  PS: Don't forget your stamp card!

This is my favorite Thai restaurant in Central Phoenix. E-San refers to an area in Northern Thailand where the food is a little more mild in flavors. There is no shortage of great flavor in Thai E-San's food though.   It's a lovely restaurant. Very nice Thai decor. They have several tables and booths to choose from.   Any time I am at a Thai restaurant, my drink of choice is the Thai iced tea. This one did not disappoint!  Highly recommended!   To eat, we started off with the Thai toast appetizer. It was a huge portion of little toast squares that are topped with a meat mixture and then coated in egg batter and fried. Served with a sweet cucumber and onion sauce. Absolutely delicious.   For my main course I had the spicy basil noodles and added chicken for my protein. I ate every bit of it. My two friends ordered tofu panang curry and pad Thai. All of our choices were delicious.   The owner of Thai E-San is a very sweet woman. She walks around chatting with her customers and makes sure everyone is happy. Nice touch!  Enjoy!

I love this place. It never disappoints and it seems like a lot of people agree because it's always packed!   It's a nice inviting restaurant. Mostly tables but they have a few large booths if you are lucky enough to get one.    We started out with the garlic hummus dip. It's very similar to regular hummus but with a blend of garlic and anchovies. Lots of garlic! Don't worry, it's not fishy at all and you can never have too much garlic right? Super good, but you probably won't be kissing anyone after eating it!   For my entree I had the Pasta Puglia (poo-lia). I have dinned at Babbo several times and I always seem to order it!  It's a combinations of Fresh Tomato Brodo, Fresh Mozzarella, Italian Sausage topped with Fresh Basil and Shaved Parmesan Cheese. Served on Fusilli pasta. The sausage in this is fantastic!   My mother ordered a salad and pizza lunch combination. She had the Caesar salad and a nice sized personal sausage, pepperoni and mushroom pizza. She loved it. I of course had to try a slice to confirm...I loved it too!  Check out Babbo! You won't be disappointed. They also run pretty good specials certain days of the week! Great happy hour too!   By the way, I was at a holiday party over the weekend catered by Babbo! Everything was delicious!   Enjoy!

El Chorro is a beautiful upscale restaurant in the heart of Paradise Valley. Generations have been coming there for anything from Sunday brunch to a drink at happy hour.  My family usually only goes there for Thanksgiving and Christmas. This Thanksgiving was another wonderful experience. Great food, great service and a beautiful setting.  Holiday lunch/dinner is a set menu with your choice of a beef, turkey or fish.  Since it was Thanksgiving I opted for the turkey dinner served with all the traditional accompaniments; mashed potatoes and gravy, stuffing, green beans and of course cranberry sauce. Also included to start out is a relish tray of mixed fresh veggies, a bowl of candied fruit and nuts, El Chorro's famous sticky buns and your choice of soup or salad. I chose the Waldorf salad to start.   Everything was fantastic!  There was also a choice of three desserts at the end but I just didn't have room so I took my pumpkin pie to go.    Ron was our server. What a nice guy! He made us feel so welcome, we didn't feel rushed (El Chorro is very busy) and he had a great sense of humor. We hope to get Ron again for our Christmas dinner.   Reservations are always a good idea at El Chorro and an absolute must for a holiday. I recommend making reservations at least two months in advance for Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter.   Enjoy!

Urban Seven was a let down after looking forward to giving it a try for weeks. The first clue was when we told the host (who was also our bartender and server) that we had a reservation. He handed us menus and told us to sit wherever we wanted. With only one other table occupied, we had the pick of the restaurant to sit. Did I mention this was at 7:30 on a Saturday night? Bad sign so far! Like the other reviews, food was decent, but not great. My dish was both overcooked (chicken) and undercooked (veges). One person out of three in our party enjoyed their food completely.  Service was terrible for being so slow, but I guess if there is one person to do everything, that's to be expected. Overall, I was very disappointed and won't go back!

Great bar located in the casino of the Palazzo Hotel. This is a full bar, but they specialize in champagne and champagne cocktails.   Prices are high but they use quality champagne in all of the cocktails. My cocktail was delicious....One Night in Venice! Yum!   Enjoy!

Press Coffee Roasters is a fantastic coffee shop in Scottsdale Quarter that I met up with a friend at  yesterday. The place was packed at 2:00PM, we were lucky to find a table outside.   I had a white mocha, excellent balance of coffee and sweetness from the white chocolate. My friend has a cappuccino and said it was perfect.    Beautiful modern interior. Probably about ten tables inside and a few tables outside. Outside is great for people watching.   Friendly, helpful staff!  I highly recommend checking Press Coffee out! Be patient though, they only make one drink at a time to ensure that its done right!   Enjoy!

Always really good food here! Great for a late night hang out. They serve food until 12:00AM, bar open till 2:00AM.  Wings and pizza are a must. Burgers are great too. Nightly specials on food and bar.   Servers are always nice, but they don't hire the girls for their brains. I asked if they had Peach Ale? "No we don't" I was told. So I settled for Blue Moon. When she asked if I wanted another Blue Moon, I inquired as to what other beer they had on draft? She listed them including Apricot Ale, which I chose. Um, if she had any brains she could have suggested the Apricot Ale when I asked if they had Peach the first time.   I won't hold it against Zipps. As I said, these girls are not hired for their brains.

It's been a while since I have posted anything about my old friend Zipps. For no reason in particular I hadn't been here for months, so to make up for it I came with a friend for late night wings two times this week. I try wings all over town and I have to say that Zipps has the best. Several flavors to choose from, but I always get the golden medium, a delicious mix of sweet and hot. I order mine extra crispy too which gives them a nice crunch. Mmm!  They also have great pizza by the slice which you can add anything you want to. I think it's $1 per topping.   Breana F took care of us both times this week. She is the best server I have ever had at a Zipps. She is always checking in and anticipates what we might need. I love that!    Zipps is a casual sports bar type place. Sometimes it can be loud but the music that is playing is usually pretty good. Of course when there is a major sports game on television it gets crazy and very busy. Check it out though, you won't be disappointed. Be sure to ask for Breana F if you visit this location!   Enjoy!

Went to Blue Hound Kitchen just for dessert and cocktails! It's in the lobby of the beautiful Palomar Hotel at City Scape, a Kimpton Hotel.   I have been to Blue Hound a couple of times for happy hour and have not been disappointed. I was definitely not disappointed for dessert.   I had the "Lost Melody" cocktail which I have enjoyed on a previous visit. Made with pisco, coconut cream, rose flower water and a couple of other ingredients. Delicious.   For dessert I had the chocolate pudding. Served in a jar with layers of graham crackers, chocolate pudding and marshmallow fluff. Vanilla ice cream and peanuts are served on the side. Oh so good!   If you are just going for cocktails, snacks or desserts, sit in the lounge right off the lobby. Great for people watching!   Enjoy!

After having more time to kill I decided to stop in here for a manicure and spa pedicure.  I am very impressed!  Let me start off by saying that I am a man, so I don't have a whole lot to compare to, but I have gotten a few mani/pedi's over the years.   I checked in and because it wasn't busy, I was called back right away to Susan.   My manicure was what you would expect, nail trim/shape, soak, clean up, buff and a lovely hand massage. I decided to skip the polish this time. ;-)  My pedicure was amazing! Their spa chairs are a little nicer than I have seen in other nail salons. Very comfortable with extra cushioning.  Even the nail technicians have nice chairs to work from. I have seen places where those poor people have to sit on a stool or even a bucket that has been turned upside down.   They have a menu of options for a pedicure depending on the services you want. I went for the "silver" package just one level above the basic  which included a sugar scrub. Prices increase with the different service you may want.   The pedicure was what you would expect, nail trim/shape, soak, clean up/exfoliation and buff. I skipped the polish on my toes as well. ;-)  Now came the two best parts...The sugar scrub and massage. The sugar scrub was a very nice citrus scent. Susan must have spent ten minutes on each leg with the sugar scrub. So nice!  Then she cleaned me off and began the warm lotion massage. Again, she spent ten minutes on each leg. Heaven! I have never had a nail tech spend so much time on the leg and foot massage. We can all agree that the massage is the best part right?   I will always go here in the future. I don't live in the area, but it will be well worth the trip.   Ladies (and gentlemen) check this place out and ask for Susan. She is very sweet and does a fantastic job.   Enjoy!

I've wanted to eat here for years and finally made it. It was a Tuesday around 11:00AM, it was very busy but not packed so I only waited for about ten minutes.   I ordered a cup of coffee to drink and the cheese omelette with a side order of bacon. Ordering the side of bacon was a must based on word of mouth and all of the reviews.   Coffee was very good and fresh.   My omelette was excellent, fluffy and full of melted American cheese. It was served with either hash browns or home style potatoes. I opted for the potatoes and they didn't disappoint. Seasoned with rosemary which was unique and delicious.   Now to that bacon...It was probably the best bacon I have ever had. Thick cut, peppered and tender. Cooked just right. Oh so good. All of those reviews were spot on.   I am already looking forward to my next visit.   Matt's is a must!   Enjoy!

Tried Bootleggers for the first time last night. Food was very good and fresh. Had the bacon board and nachos for an appetizer. Both were amazing!   After those heavy appetizers I had the cobb salad for my entree. It was also very good, very fresh!  My only complaint were the drink prices. $9 for a low ball jack and coke? We are not talking gentlemen jack or single barrel! Regular jack $9? Last time I paid that price was at the Phoenician Resort. Take note Bootleggers, I won't drink there until you fix it!

This is the best gay bar in Phoenix! I say gay bar, because it is, but it's not like the old days. I see a mix of people at the "gay bars" these days...women, straight men, etc, especially at this one.   It's a very warm welcoming bar. Absolutely beautiful and a really nice patio. Two patios actually but the main patio is so nice and relaxing.  I was very impressed by the holiday decorations. Three Christmas trees on the huge bar, a Christmas tree hanging from the ceiling, wreaths and other decorations all over. Amazing!  I don't know how Stacy does it, but it even smelled like Christmas!   I was there for Karaoke, Monday is Stacy's night for it. Excellent sound system and very nice host.   Bar staff is great. Very friendly!! I will definitely be back!  Check out Stacy's at Melrose you don't have to be gay!   Enjoy!

This is a great independent breakfast/lunch spot in East Mesa. I was in the area with some friends and we decided to try it. It is very popular as we waited for a while and there were still people lined up when we left at 1:00PM. (They are open from 7AM-2PM daily)  To drink I had the Georgia peach iced tea. Light peach flavor black tea, unsweetened. It was nice and refreshing. To eat I had the PCH Benedict.  Basically a salmon Benedict with capers, dill, poached eggs and hollandaise. I would order it again, absolutely delicious!  From looking around at what other people were ordering, I want to go back soon!  Everything looked amazing!  So many things I want to try!   They also have nice drink menu with mimosas, bloody Mary's, etc.   If you are out in the East valley and looking for a great breakfast spot, be sure to try Sunnyside!  Enjoy!

This place is pretty good for a semi fast food burger joint. I call it semi fast food because everything is cooked to order so it takes a little longer than your average fast food chain. They do have a drive-thru but it's still going to take a while to prepare your order.   This location is in what was once a Wendy's. Totally remodeled interior that looks like a 50's diner, but they left the Wendy's signature sunroom. Very clean and welcoming with tables and nice booths.   I have been several times and have always had a great burger. Burgers are fresh and have great flavor. You can fix me up however you like.   Fries are great too, always hot and delicious.   There are many things I would like to try but I always stick with the classic cheeseburger. Give this place a try!  Enjoy!

I fell in love tonight!! This bar or "cocktail lounge" as they call it is amazing!   The menu is extensive so be prepared to take your time picking out which cocktail you want to try first. The staff is very nice and not pushy at all, they will give you plenty of time to decide and they are also happy to help. I managed to try three different cocktails this visit. Before I get to that, I want to mention a little more about the staff...Super friendly, no attitude and very good service. The staff seem to work together as several different people checked on my table to see if I needed anything.   I started off with the Oriental Squeeze, then moved on to the Kaffir Lime and finished with the Wibble. I can honestly say that not one of these drinks is better than another. They are all AMAZING! The three cocktails I had all have citrus ingredients in common, something I tend lean towards. Please be patient, these cocktails are all handcrafted and made to perfection...This will of course take a little longer, but it's well worth the wait!   They serve food late which is always a good thing. Nice menu with a limited but still really great late night menu. I had the grilled cheese bites for an appetizer and the green chili mac (macaroni and cheese) as my entree. Oh so good!  One of the top mac and cheeses in the valley!   I saw a few desserts come out to other tables, they look pretty epic! I'll try to save room next time!  Check this place out! It's in a great old building and is very well done. Very comfortable!  I also want to mention how clean the restrooms are!   Enjoy!

Want to see the Las Vegas sights from the air without spending a fortune on one of those helicopter tours?  High Roller at the Linq Hotel/Casino is the thing to do. It's a ferris wheel on steroids!  It's about a 35 minute ride all the way around with amazing views. We opted for the most expensive tickets...$47 for the night time ride and a pod with an open bar. That's right, open bar folks. Pretty well stocked, tended bar and as much as you can drink in 35 minutes. They even let you take one to go when you get back on the ground.   The ride itself was amazing. Fantastic views all around. They play good music and also have an informative video playing with information on the High Roller ride experience. I would do it again!  They do have less expensive tickets...Day time is less, not having an open bar is less, etc. I have also seen discounts online.   Be sure to get tickets in advance! There was hardly anyone there the evening we went, but from the looks of it, it can be very busy. They have several staging areas for the crowds to wait in line.

Stopped in here with some friends for dinner based on a recommendation they had received. For an "order at the counter" restaurant, I was very impressed!    Located at Central and Dunlap in a strip mall. Its a really nice space. Very clean with a pretty extensive menu for the type of place this is. One thing I always like to mention is a clean bathroom, spotless here!   I had an order of chips, salsa and guacamole for an appetizer and for my entree I had the rib eye street tacos. To drink I had a Mexican bottled Coca-Cola. They have a variety of bottled beverages as well as a soda fountain.  They also serve beer.   We all ordered and took a seat outside.   One of employees brought out the guacamole. It is served with a huge portion on fresh chips, a bowl of salsa and two large scoops of fresh guacamole. Salsa was excellent, the guacamole was pretty good, it just needed a pinch of salt.   There is also a self serve salsa bar with all the traditional fixing of a Mexican restaurant like this. Pickled carrots, jalapeños, onions, etc.   Next came my rib eye tacos. I was immediately impressed by the presentation. Four street tacos and served with a grilled onion, grilled jalapeño and some sauces. These tacos were bursting with flavor and didn't require anything added. Fresh,  tender rib eye cooked to order (medium) for me. I highly recommend trying these.  My friend who also ordered these was equally impressed.   Another friend ordered the fish tacos and he said there were outstanding. Fish tacos are served three to an order.   Be sure to give this place a try. I can't wait to return and try more of what they offer!   Enjoy!

Awesome place for a late night snack or anytime of day really. Gotta love that they are open until 4:00AM daily though. Last delivery is at 3:30AM.   I had two slices of the daily pizza special. Fantastic combination of salami, cauliflower, cheeses and who knows what else. It was great.   They have a nice pizza menu and a couple of salads. They also have bottled or canned sodas. No booze here!   Very clean, limited seating inside but there is a nice patio to hang out at.   Check this place out. It's pretty cool!   Enjoy!

This is one of those restaurants I get excited just thinking about. It was the best meal of my trip to Vegas.   I heard about Yard Bird from a friend who recently ate at the one in Miami. He highly recommended that I try it and I am so happy that I did.   We started out with the house Bloody Mary. Jalapeño infused vodka is what makes this one special, it's spicy, but not too spicy. Served in a mason jar and garnished with a lime, stuffed olive, picked green bean, pickled okra and a slice of bacon. It was a delicious mini meal in itself.   For appetizers we tried the fried green tomato BLT and the deviled eggs. Both were delicious!  Really enjoyed the BLT!   For the main course I had the blue plate special which is two pieces of fried chicken (probably the best I have ever had) watermelon and a biscuit. Oh that chicken is good! So tender it almost falls off the bone.   My friends had the crunchy chicken sandwich and a chicken salad sandwich. They too loved what they ordered and said they would order it again!    We skipped dessert, but there were some pretty great looking treats on the menu. I will be sure to try one next time.   Yard Bird is a little pricy but I think it's worth every penny. Our server was Iris, she was fantastic and took very good care of us.   Enjoy!

This is my go to spot for lunch or dinner when I have a shopping day at Scottsdale Fashion Square. Always consistently good food and great drinks.   The past three times I have been to Thirsty Lion I've ordered the Smoked Turkey Club, it's so good and made panini style. I'll probably order it again next time. I do the side it is served with, I had a small side salad this time, but I have also had their fries and cole slaw. All are great!   Drinks are very good. I had two different martinis, a traditional gin to take the edge off from holiday shopping and then a pear martini for dessert.   It's a pretty large place and is really well done.  Also very comfortable. Even the bar stools are comfortable! There is an "inside patio" for people watching but there is also a regular patio off the bar as well.   Check out Thirsty Lion during your next trip to Fashion Square.   Enjoy!

Let me start out by saying that I have been here several times, but only for cocktails. This is one of my favorite spots for an after dinner drink because they are open late and it's not loud like the regular bars that are open even later.   Lately I have been siting on the patio, enjoying my cocktail next to the fireplace and heaters. They have music but it's not loud.   Drinks are wonderful. There is a large menu of handcrafted cocktails to try.   Inside is beautiful, plush seating, great lighting and friendly staff.   The food menu looks great, so I will give it a try soon.   Enjoy!

I really enjoyed Base from the moment I walked in. One of the owners promptly greeted me when I walked in and took me to the table while I waited for my friend.   The same man was also our server and went above and beyond the entire evening to take care of us.   We were there on a Tuesday night which happened to be half price pizza night. Nice surprise!   To start, we ordered the meat and cheese board, called the Ploughman Platter. It was huge and absolutely delicious. Nice selection of meats, cheeses, fruit, nuts, olives, hummus and bread.   For the main course we of course ordered pizzas. We shared two, the El Diablo and the Spicy Snag. El Diablo was a soppressata and kalamata olive pizza. Spicy Snag is a sausage and caramelized onion pizza. Both were very good but the Spicy Snag won between the two. Pizzas are big enough to share but we each polished one off.   We were too stuffed for dessert, but they had some great looking treats available. I'll have to try one next time.   Be sure to check this place out. Support those local businesses! I can't express enough how great the service was.   Enjoy!

I love the new location!  They made the move from their old location on 19th Avenue and Osborn to the old Mary Coyle building on 7th Avenue and Missouri recently. Glad they moved, the old one had great food but the location was getting a little sketchy. They did a complete renovation of the inside. Nice modern Mexican theme.   Same great food here at the new one. Excellent service. It was packed when I was here.    Great chips and salsa to start out.   I had the green chili quesadilla and albondigas soup for my entree. Both really good. The green chili was hot! My friends had beef chimichangas and said they were excellent.    I am looking forward to going back here.   Check out the new location!   Enjoy!

Lou's is fantastic!  We went on a Thursday at 5:00PM with a friend and still waited about 15 minutes as every table inside was full.  We were offered immediate seating outside on what looks like a beautiful patio, but it was just too hot to enjoy. We left at 7:00 and the place was packed, every table inside and out was full and it was about an hour wait at that point.  I recommend getting there early!  We were seated at a comfortable booth big enough for four people.  It is a trendy modern decor but still warm an inviting.  They did a really nice job.  The only downfall for me was the restroom situation.  They have one single bathroom in the lobby.  With a packed house, its slightly awkward to ask people if they are waiting for the restroom or a table.  It is also very subtle with just a M/W on the door, so imagine the weird looks I got when asking because people didn't even know they were standing right next to it.  (Perhaps there are hidden restrooms behind the closed doors to the kitchen, but I was directed to the one in the lobby.)  Moving on to the good stuff... We started with the regular size Malnati Salad.  Romaine lettuce, tomatoes, black olives, mushrooms, salami bits and gorgonzola cheese with our Sweet Vinaigrette and romano cheese. $8.75  |  Family size $12.95 This salad was excellent. Crisp lettuce, fresh ingredients, delicious! I couldn't stop eating it.  This size was perfect for two people.    For the main event we ordered the medium Malnati Chicago Classic.   Made with Lou's lean sausage, some extra cheese and vine-ripened tomato sauce on Buttercrust.  It's authentic Chicago!  Personal (serves 1) $9.35 Small (serves 2) $14.95 Medium (serves 3) $19.95 Large (serves 4) $23.95  We added pepperoni to our pizza, but truthfully it didn't need it.  The pizza would have been plenty flavorful as is.  I would imagine this is why pepperoni isn't on it to begin with.  This deep dish favorite is fabulous!  Loaded with cheese!  Highly recommended!  The medium easily serves three people as shown.  It is cut into six slices, we each had two and took two home.  Perfect!    They do offer other things like pastas and sandwiches, but why would you not have pizza?  Especially deep dish pizza!  They do offer thin crust, but I wouldn't do it!    Sorry I can't report on dessert, just didn't have room!  Enjoy!

With all of the hype about Shake Shack, I had to give it a try for myself.   Very nice location at Central and Camelback, the work they did to change this retail space is quite impressive. It's beautiful in fact. More importantly lots of seating inside and some outside.   Okay, let's get to the real reason I was there. The burgers!  At first I was discouraged by the prices.  I had the Shack burger with cheese $5.29 and cheese fries $3.99. I had heard great things about the shakes, so I just had to splurge and order one, peanut butter, $5.29. So as you can see, with tax I was over $15.00. A lot for a fast food joint!  I took a seat and my number was called shortly. Presentation was great. Though the burger looked  small, it was well put together. The shake too was in a small cup.   Ready? It is probably one of the best fast food burgers I have ever had. Flavor was amazing! Their special sauce is quite good. Best of all, they use a potato bun which makes a huge different.  The crinkle cut fries were also great especially covered in hot cheese sauce.   My peanut butter shake was soooo good. It turned out to be just the right size as it was very rich.   In the end Shake Shack is worth it. My only complaint would be the burger size, I could have eaten two, but it's hard to justify getting another at $5.29.   Enjoy!

Yep, only two stars from me for this place. My friends and I were so excited to try this place after talking about it for weeks.   Being on Open Table-5 stars Building/restaurant itself-5 stars Hostess-5 stars Service-5 stars Food-1 star  Sure, that should probably bring it up to a better star average, but it's really about the food every time right?  Party of 4, we liked 1 out of the 5 dishes we ordered and shared.   Started off with the potted crab and the roasted cauliflower. The potted crab is basically a crab dip served with grilled bread. The bread is from an outside source which is a thick sliced white/sourdough type. The potted crab was a pot of crap! Hardly any crab flavor let alone any flavor at all. Not even any spices.   The roasted cauliflower was even worse. What really disappointed me in the cauliflower was that our server recommended it over another side that I wanted to try. She even said "oh the cauliflower is the way to go because of how flavorful it is". Did she mean it was the least flavorful? I hate to say that too because our server was really good.   Moving on to the main events. Two of us had the NY steak, another had the chicken sandwich and I had the Cuban sandwich.   The steaks were served sliced. I actually love this concept and it reminds me of a famous place in New York (I have a personal rule against naming another restaurant when writing reviews no matter how poor). I was so excited for the first bite and again was let down. Zero flavor, not even any salt and what was worse was all the fat and gristle, like hard gristle. Gross! It was like this on both steaks!   As for my Cuban sandwich, it was decent. I think the bread they used is the wrong choice as it's just over powering and takes away from the important stuff between those two slices!   The winner was the chicken sandwich. Fried chicken breast with sweet and spicy toppings. The bread for this one is a bun which nicely complimented the important stuff!   As I said, we liked 1 out of 5 dishes. That's pretty disappointing. I think simply adding some salt to a few of those dishes would have helped. Speaking of which, what is with these trendy places not having salt and pepper on the tables? Your food is not that good, get over yourself!   Sorry Stock & Stable!  Look at your reviews, people like your place but hate your flavorless food!

This was only my second Yelp Elite event and I had so much fun. It was so much more casual than my first one so I was able to meet many more people. I loved it!   I had never heard of Inchin's Bamboo-Garden. They took really good care of us and provided tons of food. Many of us took food home which was a nice touch.   All of the food was good. Baby corn appetizer!?Delicious and unique!  As for the entrees, I really enjoyed the fish and chicken. The noodles were great too. I couldn't stop eating!   I loved the dessert. Vanilla use cream and fried crispy noodles with honey. Such a yummy combination and perfectly sweet.   Many thanks to Hailey for organizing another fantastic Elite event. We love you!  Can't wait for the next one!
