My wife and I booked the Lomi for Lovers package. This was after a discussion with Sara on the phone where she helped me determine what package would be best for my wife and I. I'm a seasoned massage recipient but wife has only had a few.   The entire experience was wonderful. The staff was very friendly and welcoming. The spa itself is in good repair. The customer lounge area backs up to a lake on the property which just added to the ambiance.  Our massage therapists, Heather and Zach were very detailed in their orientation to the massage and listened to our concerns and desires. They both delivered and we felt like jelly after the massage, it was fantastic!  After the massage we showered off in one of the large showers with a rainfall shower head and side jets. It was the perfect way to rinse off some of the oil and enjoy the hot water.   After the shower we were treated to a pineapple and an orange set of sorbets. Both were delicious!   We will be back!

We just had our third visit at the spa for a 90 minute Lomi Lomi for couples. It was pure bliss!  Joining the spa was one of the best choices we've made!

The food was good. I didn't get quite what I ordered, but that worked out ok. The service, however, was extremely slow an inattentive. We waited quite some time to get our drink order taken and then several more minutes to get our food order in. During this entire time we we passed by several servers. One paused a moment to say she would be right with us and then never returned. We were finally waited on by a gentlemen that had an attitude like we were bothering him by being there.  We had also asked for some additional butter and that request was promptly forgotten.   As I said the food was really good but it will be a while before I go back due to the poor quality of the service.
