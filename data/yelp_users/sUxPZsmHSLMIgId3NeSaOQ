This family owned & operated store is the best.  Everyone is friendly and they're always willing to help you out.  So I had some spare diamonds and my mother in-laws ruby ring and wanted to create something out of it.  I worked with Amanda who came up with my necklace design and I love it!

I love this place!  The drinks are always yummy and I'm addicted to their salads, some of my favorites are: fez salad, pesto caesar and classic Caesar.  Oh! and all Fez fries are delicious too!  This place is fabulous and I recommend that everyone should go there, they don't disappoint.

I used to eat here all the time when it first opened up but got spoiled with all the great dining in my area, central Phoenix and quit making the trip to Scottsdale.  So this past Sunday we decided to journey up to Scottsdale for Sunday brunch.  I notice that the dining area has become more formal than it used to be but the atmosphere and food are still fantastic.  Their peach bellini's are yummy and all the food super delicious!

I've used ExecuCar for the past few years because it's easy to schedule my car, they're professional and on-time.  I used them this week to get me to-from the airport and as always our driver was professional, courteous and on-time.  What I really like is getting a text upon my return to Phoenix so I can call my driver after I grabbed my bags from the luggage area.

This place is always packed so my husband made a reservation to avoid the wait.  This was our 1st visit and the food and service was great.  I ordered the Caribbean lobster tail and he got the deep fried shrimp & chicken.  He mistakenly ordered a large portion which he couldn't finish.  We ordered the sweet tea and mango ice tea and they were the best we've ever had. I now get why this place is packed all the time.

I've been going to them for about a year and half now.  Typically I see Dr. Lee D.O. or Meagan Crary FNP and both are great, professional and knowledgeable.  Last Spring I had on-going sinus issues, they did all the work ups & meds that they could and referred by on to an ENT.  It turned out that I had a polyp that was the culprit of my problems and had surgery to remove it.  This past Fall and into the Winter I had a cough that wouldn't go away, again they did all the tests/meds and referred me to a pulmonologist who was able to help me.  Both my ENT & Pulmonologist said that my PCP doctors did as much as they could and were very thorough so that renews my confidence that they're doing a great job.  Plus, I love that I rarely have to wait long to see my doctors it's a real pleasure being able to get in and out of there on time.

My husband and I have been taking our vehicles there for the past couple of years.  George as the Manager at the time and we had outstanding and honest service.  We brought my vehicle in on Saturday 4/12 and we were given a list of 3 things that were wrong with it:  Radiator hoses looked worn, Power steering line was leaking & AC filter to my dash board was clogged.  We got a price quote of $800 for the radiator and power steering issues.  We felt this price was VERY high and asked to speak to George who we found out is at another store location.  Needless to say we didn't have that work done.  We did take my vehicle to another repair place (not Sun Devil Auto) and they identified the same issues.  We had them fix all 3 and the total cost was $380.  We will never bring our cars back to Sun Devil after this incident.

After my bad experience on 4/12 and my review on Yelp, Scott the Manager called my husband and offered him a free oil change &a replacement to the a/c filter casing in my dash they cracked (it was discovered that it was broken) by the other shop who did all my repairs for half the cost.  On Sat. 4/26 & we brought my husband's truck in for the free oil change & we explained that we're not leaving my vehicle there because we had the kids & errands to run that morning.  When my husband picked up his truck in the late afternoon, Scott (Mgr) said to him that they heard that I was yelling and saying that I was never bring my car back to them.  My husband told him there was NO TRUTH to that story and explained that we need a vehicle that day since we had the kids.  Additionally, my husband said to Scott, "hey you were here the day you quoted me $800 to fix the two (2) things and why didn't you try to make it right then?  Scott had no answer.  However, they did give him a replacement a/c filter casing for my car which was appropriate since they cracked it.  Needless to say, we will NEVER bring our vehicles back to this location.  Too bad George (previous Manager) is gone, we've been taking our cars to him for years and we were always treated fairly & with respect.

Mr. Fox was a lifesaver and fantastic.  We had an emergency on Mon. 9/21 before we left town for the week.  He came right over and worked relentlessly for hours to fix the problem.  Honestly i'm not sure another company would've hung in there to figure out what the problem was or if they did they would've charge us an arm & a leg.  He was polite & professional and reasonably priced.  We plan on getting some repairs done next year and he's the only person that we'll trust to do the job.

It was a girl's afternoon and we went there for the 1st time Easter afternoon.  We split the crispy calamari and chopped salad (we ordered the small and it was still a huge portion) and had a couple of Blue moon beers and red sangria.  We topped our meal off with some doughnut holes while we were finishing our drinks.  The atmosphere is casual and everything was delicious and our server was super nice and funny we'll definitely come back.

Great haunted house!  The actors and effects are amazing and I screamed like a little girl and it's worth every dollar!  Can't wait to see what spooky surprises they have in store for us for 2014!

The staff are helpful & friendly and the prices are reasonable.  I have 2 Tonkinese cats and 1 of them developed an allergy to her food (Royal Canin) and the staff directed me to a single protein no filler food.  Since the switch she's back to normal.

Finally ate there last night and loved it.  The place is charming the food was great but no desserts so that's why not a 5 star rating.  The tacos were bigger than I expected so next time I'll just order 1 and not 2.  I can't wait to go back and eat there again.

Based on the wonderful reviews I had my husbands truck detailed for his birthday.  Daryl is professional and a pleasure to work with.  I can honestly say that his work exceeded my expectations.  My husband's truck is only a year and a half old and he takes really good care of it so to see the end result of how shiny the paint job was & how black all the trim/running boards was AMAZING to say the least.  The photos really don't capture how GREAT everything turned out.  I highly recommend Daryl!

Finally got around to eating here and wasn't disappointed.  We popped in for lunch on July 4th, the grounds and restaurant were inviting and can't wait to sit outside when the weather cools down.  I ordered the CALAMARI & SHRIMP FRITTI as my main course and my hubby had the a french dip.  We both loved our food and plan to return really soon.
