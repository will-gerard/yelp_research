Great night with co workers... thanks for the great service. We will return at a later date. As a matter of fact I will return with many of my friends and family.

Waited for 45 mins for food. No one let us know what any issues may have been. Asked to talked to manager 4 times  Finally came out to speak with me. Acted like he didn't even care.... Manager told me he was stuck in the kitchen because he was short handed. Not really my problem. This will be the last time I bring any of my groups to Wild Buffalo Wings..Still waiting for our check... Been an additional 20 minutes
