Seriously? How do you not have bagels? No cinnamon raisin not even plain? They offered a potato bagel. No. Quality gets worse every week - now they don't even make enough. Not going back anymore.  Annoying.

I have eaten here a few times.  It's pretty good as far as street tacos go.  Not many places other than Mexico that you can get those...  Today I had the Bombero Burro with chicken.  OMG this was fabulous.  It was pretty spicy - for those that don't like spice - don't get it because you won't be able to eat it.  But if you are a fan of spicy food - this is what to order (with your choice of meat of course).  It is a pretty good sized burro - I couldn't finish it all - and trust me, I tried.  I ordered it a la carte - there is a combo option - but again, it's a huge burro...  This place is nothing fancy but worth a stop in.

My husband and I have lived in this area and have been going to this Rubio's location for several years. On each of our prior two visits for take out, our order was incorrect. Each time we called the restaurant and spoke with the manager on duty. The most recent time the manager offered to give us credit saying that they wanted to make it right and the next meal was on Rubio's and to just let them know the next time that we came in.   This evening maybe not even two weeks since that visit, my husband went to get our usual takeout order and advised the manager that we were told our next meal was on Rubio's. The manager on duty, Oscar not only refused to honor this but became rude and argumentive saying that they didn't keep track of these things, that he needed to know the exact date, the name of the manager we spoke with and the exact meal so that he could go through all of the receipts for that evening. My husband explained that he didn't have the exact date and thought the managers name was Rick - Oscar said there were a lot of managers and he wouldn't honor the other manager's promise to make it right. My husband explained that we would pay this time but we would never be back and Oscar's response was 'whatever'.   Very poor customer service this evening and even worse quality as of late. There are so many other places to eat near us, we have no problem never going to this Rubio's location again.

I wanted to review this location since I'd just given a less than stellar review of a different location...  The Ahwatukee store ROCKS!  I guess since I've always had really good food and service from this store, I'd come to expect the others to be just as good.  Unfortunately, that is not the case.  My usual is the chicken cheese steak w/grilled mushrooms and onions, sweet peppers on the sandwich and hot peppers on the side.  Not many places around that you can order a chicken cheese steak where the chicken is actually sliced thin like a regular cheesesteak as opposed to big hunks of dried out chicken on a sandwich.  I've never had a bad one at this location. Never.    Like I said they are consistently good - that's why it was such a disappointment when twice at other locations the food was not as good as these guys make it here.  I don't think I'll try another location again...

Meh. Went here Saturday morning and thought the breakfast burros looked good. They are big and $5.99 each. Got one chorizo and one bacon. Thought since it's AJ's and $6 each - they had to be good.   Nope.   I swear the eggs tasted powdered or liquid or something. Not freshly cracked. They also seemed undercooked. The 'bacon' was disgusting. It looked as if they processed it through a meat grinder or food processor. It was chewy and fatty and undercooked as well. No crisp whatsoever. Because it was so finely ground, you couldn't even pick it out of the burrito.  There was very little cheese.   In my 35 years of living in Phoenix, I have never had a more disappointing breakfast burro. It's not a difficult thing to prepare.  At $6 each it should have been better. At AJ's, I expect so much more.   Never again.

I've been dining at Pei Wei locations all over the Valley for years and years. After moving to Ahwatukee from Central Phoenix a couple of years ago, this location became the closest to me. It used to be reliable and consistent but the last several times I've been, the quality has really suffered.   A few months ago I ordered some take-out for my family.  After getting it home and going to eat my meal, I realized that my order was very wrong.  Now I'd become accustomed to this location forgetting things like sauces for the appetizers, napkins, soy sauce and fortune cookies (things that are supposed to be included with take-out), but my dish was inedible to me.    I called to complain, the manager was apologetic and offered that I come back and pick up a replacement OR he would send me a gift card to replace my meal.  Since I have an infant that I needed to get to bed, I opted for the gift card.  A month or so went by and my husband suggested Pei Wei.  That's when I realized that I never received the replacement gift card!  We ordered and when my husband picked it up, he mentioned the issue we had the last time and they gave him a discount.  As usual, things were missing from the order (no appetizer sauce, napkins, fortune cookies, etc.) and the food was just okay.  Tonight we ordered again, this time the food was just horrible.  Bland, no taste whatsoever for either of our dishes!  I ordered the new Korean BBQ with chicken (I had it before) and really liked it.  My husband had the same but with tofu and vegetables.  Neither of us thought the food was good at all.  The sauce which is normally very tasty was so bland and watery that it literally ran off of the chicken.  The 'salad' that comes with it was wilted and soggy, clearly not fresh.  And as expected, no sauce for the crab wontons, no napkins, no soy sauce & no fortune cookies.    I don't think we will be going back anytime soon - at least not to this location - they really need to get it together.  We're tired of the issues every time we eat in or get take-out from here.

Wow. Rude. The staff in the bakery/coffee area are not pleasant.   My family stopped in to get something sweet. The girl behind the counter was not friendly at all. When asked for a sample she seemed annoyed and rushed even though no other customers were there. Her impatience made the situation awkward for my kids and for me. She just kept asking anything else, anything else to rush us along. No smile. No personality. She was just unpleasant.   While we were getting ice cream, my husband was looking for cannoli. The other Whole Foods stores in the Valley full the cannoli as you order it. Theirs was pre-filled and in the case. On this particular day they had one cannoli. My husband was inquiring to the other employee about when this was prepared.  He couldn't see the date in the bottom and asked. Apparently it was already 2-3 days old so obviously it would be soggy. He said we were used to the Whole Foods near us where they made them to order. The employee said well we're not as busy we don't have the staff etc.  Made excuses instead of offering a solution even being friendly and then said anything else (just like the other) and walked away.   My husband looked at the girl helping me and asked is she always this rude? Not knowing that the girl helping me was just as rude. She replied with 'well when you talk about other Whole Food stores and how they do things, well...' As if their shitty attitudes were justified.   Since the person helping my husband was supposedly a manager my husband told her 'you know you gotta be nicer to your customers and not be so rude'. Her reply was 'I didn't think I was being rude'.   My husband wasn't rude not was I or anyone in my family. These two were just jerks.   Then we go to check out and the cashier was tweaking hard. But at least he was nice. Amped up - but nice.   WTF Whole Foods?!

Needed a cake for my daughter's baptism.  As typical for me, I waited til about a week and half before the event to look for a cake!  :)   I went to a few bakeries in the Valley for samples and quotes.  It wasn't until I sampled some of the super yummy pastries from Honey Moon Sweets did I feel like I was going to be happy with a cake.   The desserts they have are fabulous and the STANDARD cake is soooo delicious and very reasonable compared to the quotes that I had been receiving from everyone else.  Since it was their "standard" a week's notice was sufficient.    This cake was absolutely fabulous!  EVERYONE complimented on how pretty the cake was and how fantastic it tasted.    I am soooo glad that I decided to go with them and will be using them again in the future...

Went here today for lunch after not being here in like 15-20 years.  This place has been around awhile just like Johnny's Red Hots and First Watch.  Others in the area are mostly new-comers and chains.  Pino's was great then and still is!   The front parking was full as were most of the tables with local business people, firemen, cops, etc.  I ordered a couple of slices, one cheese, one with pepperoni and black olives.  They were both fantastic.  The crust was delicious and the flavor of the sauce and the pepperoni was outstanding.    I'm not sure what the previous reviewer Kris M was talking about.  This place is authentic.  The place Kris refers to a couple of buildings down (Z-pizza) is not.   Don't get me wrong - Z has it's place but anyone over the age of 14 knows the difference between authentic Italian and a funky California based chain.  As for the pepperoni, they use an authentic aged and cured pepperoni, not some packaged and processed American version of pepperoni.  And as for Kris M making fun of the name, IT'S THE GUY'S NAME!!  Seriously, how immature are you to make fun of someone's name???  It's a common Italian fist name.  Grow up!!  Like the previous reviewer said - try them yourselves!  If you're looking for authentic Italian, you won't be disappointed!

Tory Burch Outlet...  that makes it worth the trip.  Lots of other stores for those not interested in that brand.  The parking is kind of tight and usually pretty packed.  There are two PEV charging stations if you have that type of vehicle, however I have never been able to get them to work with my card.

Met a friend for lunch here today (Thursday).  It was my first time here but she'd been there for brunch many times and was missing it.    I had the chicken salad sandwich which was really fantastic.  I am usually a little apprehensive to try a chicken salad at a place that I'm not familiar with but it just sounded so good: zatar spice, currants, pine nuts, arugula, tomato, and lemon vinaigrette.  The bread was fabulous and it was really good sized.  It was served slightly warmed and that made it even better.  It was just yummy.  It came with a choice of sides and I chose the fries.  I loves me some fresh cut fries!  These were awesome!    Now, the entrée was a $12 menu item but I didn't mind since the portion was quite large (I took half with me) and the fries were abundant enough to share and it was just that good.  The whole meal really could have been shared between the two of us.  My friend ordered the corn flatbread (tomato, goat cheese and walnut pesto) and this was fabulous as well.  The bread was very nice but the center did get a little soft making it a little difficult to eat with one hand (but not impossible).  My friend actually managed quite well while holding her 4  1/2 month old baby in her lap.  The service was wonderful; everyone was quite friendly and attentive and made sure that our needs were being met.  We did not have to ask for a thing.    The parking was limited, but they did provide complimentary valet (minus the tip of course).  I'm glad that I finally got to try St Francis as I'd moved from central Phoenix just when it opened.  This place is just another incentive to move back.  :D

Tired of the same old Ahwatukee restaurants, we decided to give Joe's Farm Grill in Gilbert a try.  We actually couldn't decide on Joe's Farm Grill or Joe's Real BBQ, but ultimately picked Farm Grill because I was craving fries and the BBQ joint does not serve them...  When we arrived, there was a line to order, however it moved pretty quickly.  I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich and although initially I wanted fries, I opted for the onion rings at the last minute.  Both were excellent.  I rarely order a chicken sandwich because usually a grilled chicken sandwich from a restaurant is inedible, but here the chicken was moist and flavorful.  I was not disappointed.  The onion rings were great too.    My man ordered the double dogs with chili - two chili dogs - they looked really good!  He also had fries that I shared.  :)  We sat outside since we were lucky enough to have 80-ish degrees in the middle of a Phoenix summer.  It was so nice!  The sounds and the smells of the Farm reminded me of BBQs and picnics I enjoyed as a child in Illinois and made me realize it was probably time for a visit again.  :)  Next time we are going to give Joe's Real BBQ  a try!

I really liked this place...    I live in Ahwatukee, but have been getting horrible service from all of the regular places in the 'tuk' so I made the dreaded cross over the I-10 to Chandler.  I was pleasantly surprised!    It was a last minute decision so I called from the car to see what the wait time was - they said they could take me as soon as I got there.  When I arrived, I noticed how busy it was and expected to have to sit and wait that standard "10-15" minutes...  Not so!  I was immediately taken back for my services.  The tech working on me was very good - a little more quiet than the rest of the staff - but very friendly.  I noticed that everyone was wearing a white shirt - assumed it was the 'uniform'.  Also noticed that all of these ladies had on designer jeans and shoes - they must do quite well here.  My pedicure was awesome as was the manicure.  This is a really cute and clean place - the nail bar is fun to sit at.  They have TONS of gel/shellacs to choose from, not just a few colors of one line.  They all seemed quite knowledgeable.   I was getting a standard French manicure but the girl next to me was getting color and having a hard time choosing.  Her Tech was very patient and professional with her.  Everyone here is super nice.  I also noticed that her brows looked great and asked if she'd had them waxed there.  She said yes and that she always does a great job.  I'll have to try it next time.  I can't wait to see how long the manicure lasts.  I've had some other chip within days (even though the gels are NOT supposed to).    I would definitely go back here, even if I do have to cross the freeway - and anyone in the area should give them a try too!

I booked this company based on the reviews here on Yelp.  Initially I was referred to another company that a friend had used.  I called them and they were unable to accommodate my schedule or even offer anything close to it.  I searched here and found the wonderful reviews posted.  I called and spoke to Pam who was awesome.  She answered my questions and worked with me to fit my schedule.  On top of that - they were more competitively priced than the company I initially called.  I also immediately received an email confirming what we discussed.  The movers arrived on-time (early actually) and were very efficient.  My place was loaded and moved in no time!  They were professional and extremely helpful.   This was the first time I've ever used a moving service - and now I wonder how I never did before.  What would have taken me days took them hours and nothing was damaged!  I would absolutely use them again and recommend them to anyone looking to hire movers.

I really like this place.  It's a little different and usually not busy - but they are pretty new and in an area of town that just doesn't get that busy.  It's a huge place so it looks more empty than full.  Plus they are not advertising on TV and billboards like the only other competitors (chains) in the area.  I really like the salsa and the hot sauce.  One thing I really LOVE is the shrimp cocktail.  It is fabulous!  Fresh and full of shrimp.  I don't think I've ever had one in the Valley that has been as good.  It reminds me of sitting beach side in Mexico.  I go back often just for the shrimp cocktail.  My daughter is vegetarian and there are plenty of options for her, besides the standard vegetarian Mexican dishes of cheese enchilada and cheese quesadilla.  It's not fancy and it's not packed, but that is part of what I love about it!

Had a Groupon - went there today...  It was fantastic!    I had the Oaxaca Black Mole Chicken Taco plate. Loved it!  I normally don't order rice and beans but since It was my first time visiting here, I did get them.  The beans had a nice flavor and they were moist enough to dip my chips in and eat that way.  The rice had bits of corn and cilantro and was very flavorful.    The salsa bar was also delicious with several options to choose from, including a strawberry salsa that was very nice for the sweltering Phoenix summer day.    I liked La Condesa so much, I bought another Groupon while eating my lunch!  :)

Fantastic!    Super-fast and friendly service.  I had a small heart-shaped picture frame that needed the glass replaced.  They treated me like I was a million dollar client and I was in and out in under 5 minutes.  I would absolutely recommend this company to anyone for any type of glass needs...

I received a call from my regular groomer today telling me that my 9 1/2 year old Shih tzu-poo had a really bad ear infection.  As I've recently moved to the Ahwatukee area, I had no local vet so I checked Yelp for the nearest to my house.    I called Family Vetcare and they were able to see us right away.  They were very kind and professional both on the phone and in person.  The exam was through and I was explained everything in detail.  I am glad that I found such a good vet so close to home.

Being new to the downtown, I am not familiar with all of the good places to go for lunch.  On top of that, there aren't many within walking distance of my office.  It takes a good ten minutes for me to even get my car out of the parking garage and soon the summer heat will be here and I'll have no desire to leave the building at all.  I was very hopeful about Zeez since it's only 4 blocks from my office.  I checked the menu out on-line and was in the mood for shawerma but when I got there, I opted for the Phoenician Chicken sandwich.  This is a shredded chicken on a roll.  The chicken was very tasty and the bread was fabulous.  I'm glad I switched it up at the last minute.  The staff was extra helpful and the place is very clean.  There were about 8-10 tables and they weren't too busy - mostly government types (like myself) since it's across the street from the courts and jails.  There is plenty of room for more tables once this place gets busy and I expect that it will be once the new Court Tower opens in February of 2012.  The sandwich came with some pita chips and a little hummus and a pickle.  It was pretty good as well.    Next time I think I'll try the shawerma. :)

I literally haven't eaten beef in 24 years. Really.  Many times friends and family have tried to convince me to 'just eat a burger'.  I'm from the Midwest for gosh sake.  For whatever reason, I decided tonight was the night and 5 Guys was the place.    This was one pretty damn good burger.  Got exactly what I wanted and the fries were great too.   I have to admit I was afraid to try it but this burger, I would eat again...  Maybe I won't wait another 24 years though...

Ate here at lunch today for the first time. "eh" is all I can say. I came in around 12:45 and even though no one was behind me in line the twerp at the counter made me feel very rushed.   I ordered a Turkey Tom. This was basically a big white dried out sandwich roll with a couple of slices of turkey, a butt-load of shredded lettuce, a couple of sliced tomatoes and some mayo (I requested no sprouts which are normally also included). What is supposed to be gourmet about that? The sprouts?    I also grabbed a chocolate chunk cookie. Not even worth eating the whole cookie. Really.   I see no reason to return and don't understand how they can call themselves gourmet...

When will I learn...  Occasionally I like to give places that have disappointed me a second chance.  Today I was running errands on lunch and popped in here to take a sandwich back to the office.    Let me preface by saying that it had been months - nearly a year - since I'd visited here.  This was due to consistenly mediocre food and the final straw being bright blue peices of rubber chopped up in my salad.  I can't beleive that the staff didn't notice but I did - after I'd already gotten back to my office and did not have enough time to go back.  I had no lunch that day...    So today I thought - I'll pick up a sandwich to go.  It's been a while - I'm sure things are better.  The sandwich was an "Uptown Turkey on Harvest Toast".  It has turkey, bacon, avocado, lettuce, tomato and mayo.  Well the avocado was so insignificant, I'd actually forgotten it was an ingredient.  The lettuce wilted - not from the toast but from sitting around.  The bread too toasted and burnt in the middle.  What a disappointment.    I really do not reccomend this place at all.  It's not even worth going back to have my messed up meals 'replaced'.

I had a regular groomer at Petsmart who was a friend of the family and did an excellent job - then she moved out of state. On a Saturday morning I called Betty's to see if they could take my shih-poo for a long over due grooming. I spoke with Betty over the phone and must say she was very pleasant and friendly. I explained what I needed and she understood immediately. Since my husband was dropping her off, he would not be able to explain what I wanted. I was. Glad that I could speak to the groomer ahead of time and that she understood how and what I was trying to explain. After a couple of hours Sweetie was ready and she looked great!! Better than she has in a while even with a 'summer cut'. Sweetie seems happy and I'm sure we'll be back!

So today I tried the downtown location. I'd only been to the Tempe/Scottsdale location before and had really liked it, even though I'm not vegan or vegetarian.   Well, I don't know if it was this location or if the restaurant has changed that much but it really wasn't good. Not at all.   The Green Burger that I'd eaten at the other location was phenomenal. I've lived with vegetarians for years and have tried a lot of vegan and vegetarian food and have never cared much for it (unless I was preparing it) but the Green Burger was amazing.  It was a house ground and packed oats & barley veggie burger with fresh lettuce and tomato, vegan mayo, ketchup and pickles (per the website).   When I tried to order it today, it was no longer on the menu. I was told the menu had recently changed and the patty is now different - even though the Green Burger is still listed as a menu item on the website. This new burger is just awful. It's much smaller and it's soy based and tastes worse than a Boca patty. If I wanted a crappy little frozen soy patty, I wouldn't pay nearly ten dollars for it...   The fries, which were also amazing at the other location were nothing special here either. They are supposed to be seasoned - they are called "Thyme Fries" so I expected some, I don't know, thyme?  Nada - no seasoning whatsoever. They were good but just plain old fries.   It wasn't just me. My husband who has 16 years of vegetarian/vegan experience and who really enjoyed the Argentine Po-Boy previously just looked at me and said "no bueno".  It was mostly bread with hardly any filling in it.  Much different than the other location.  Between apps, sandwiches and a couple of iced teas, it cost nearly $50 for lunch for my daughter, husband and me.  Totally not worth it.   I'd go to the Tempe/Scottsdale location again if I knew for sure the Green Burger was available, otherwise I can't see myself returning.

Are you kidding me?  Fair warning: I am super super annoyed right now....  I bought a Groupon for this place August 29, 2011 for some underarm hair removal (yes, I'm too lazy to shave my pits) because it was a good deal and close to my home.  When I called for my initial appointment, they did not have anything available until mid-February.  Really?  Fine - I booked.  Then they moved.  Now they are about ten miles from me.  Okay but annoying.   The first session went well.  There was really no wait time or pain.  I was in and out quickly and booked my next appointment.    At the next appointment, they were able to complete one side (one armpit).  Then the machine broke.  It just wouldn't start back up.  Instead of them squeezing me in for the three minute treatment in another room with the other machine, they told me to call and reschedule the appointment.  Again, annoying, but things happen.  The next appointment to get the other side done was within two weeks but I had to wait in the lobby for a while for my appointment.  Then there was confusion on the client being called back - there were two Katherine's and since I'd been waiting longer and the other Katherine didn't get up, I assumed it was me - of course it wasn't.  When I got back into the room, it turned out that it was the medical office that Simplicity shared an office whith that had called me back.  They brought me back to the waiting room and apologized for the confusion saying they weren't allowed to say last names because of privacy reasons.  What?  Never heard of that.  Whatever.  My next session is scheduled for May 12th.  Today I get an email that THEY'VE MOVED AGAIN!  Now they are nearly 20 miles from me.  WTH??!!  So I called, to make sure that I understood the email correctly, that they had moved again (of course no one had told me that they would be relocating during any of the sessions or phone calls).  They confirmed that yes, they did move today.  I very politely said to the girl (she seemed VERY young) that I found this a little annoying that they'd moved once again.  She explained that it would be so much better now since they were not sharing an office anymore and relying on others.  She did NOT apologize. I asked well who can you communicate that to, that I've had to be inconvenienced with the equipment not working and now them moving further and further away?  Is there someone that you can let know?  She told me she would put a note on my file.  I said well, that's fine but will anyone see it?  Then she said, well I'm not really sure what you want to get out of this.  WHAT?!  I said well, all I'm trying to do is lodge a complaint with someone who would care that I've had such an annoying experience but it doesn't appear that is going to happen right now, so thank you.  She told me to have a nice day.  LOL  I still have 4 more sessions to go through for my entire treatment.  I'm pretty bummed so far and can't really recommend this place.  I'm not even sure if the treatment has made a difference yet since I've only had two and supposedly it takes up to six.  :(

Well this place is just fantastic.  So much so that I had it two days in a row!!!  Brought some co-workers with me the second day and they all agreed!!!  The Phoenix is my new favorite sandwich - and it's great with the chicken!  Everyone else had steak and we all just loved it.

No!!  Don't do it!    This is my second review on this particular merchant.  They were previously located at 1455 W. Chandler Blvd Ste B-11 inside of the Bellagio Clinic.  They promised that the move to their own facility would enable them to provide better service.  Not at all...  Apparently, if you are a male and have an accent, certain staff does not wish to be pleasant or provide even the most basic customer service, let alone treatment.  Let's just say my husband has had a truly horrible experience with this place.  To the point of being prejudicial, but that is his story to tell...  I've really tried to give this place a second chance after the last experience I had.  They swore up and down that that was not how they normally operate and that the move (another 10 miles out of my way, now totally 20 from my home) would only allow them to improve service as they would no longer be restriced by working in a physician's office.  Here is what I know:  It's impossible to get scheduled within a reasonable amount of time.  They are either under staffed, overbooked or both.  It's impossible to speak to someone who is not a child.  Seriously, they all are just out of high school.  They can't answer simple questions and they are all sitting around texting or looking at Facebook on their cell phones.  There is never any management on site.  How is this even permitted by their corporate office?  The website says "Our staff includes a certified esthetician, a registered nurse, a nurse practitioner, and a full time board certified medical doctor".  Not true.  No one is in the office except for the very young and unsupervised Laser Technicians.    You cannot call them directly.  You must call the 800 number to ask questions about anything.  Even to ask driving directions when you cannot locate the new office and there is no signage to help you find the place.    They have tip jars in the rooms.  Really?! Tip jars??!  Is this Starbucks?  This to me is completely tacky.  I have been in the service/hospitably/spa industry for over ten years and I have NEVER seen nor would even ever ALLOW a tip jar to be placed in a treatment room with a HUGE sign stating that tips are appreciated!  Of course they are - but don't make me uncomfortable and feel obligated to leave one - especially when the service is so very poor.  To submit a complaint, you must fill out a form online and wait for a call.  I did just that and received a call the next day from what I assume to be the location manager.  She left a voice mail.  I've been trying to call her back for three days.  It goes straight to voice mail.  I've left a voice mail but still no return call.  Over it and getting all of my money back from Groupon...

Meh -   I've been to this location twice.  Each time it was sort of disappointing...  I live in Ahwatukee and that location ROCKS so maybe they could learn from them??  I called ahead and placed my order so I wouldn't have to wait.  When I arrived, there was a line so I walked up to the side of the counter where people picked up their order.  I said I'd called it and needed to pick it up, but I was directed to wait in line anyway.  Kind of disappointing since I'd called ahead.  I expected a call-in pick up line like most other places.  After waiting patiently in line, I picked up my order and ran back to the office.  As I ate my sandwich, I couldn't help be disappointed.  This was not anything like the ones I was used to getting in Ahwatukee.  I ordered my usual, the chicken cheese steak w/grilled mushrooms and onions, sweet peppers on the sandwich and hot peppers on the side.  They'd forgotten the hot peppers, not that big of a deal, but there was hardly any mushroom, onion or sweet peppers either.  The cheese was skimpy and the meat was dry and overdone.  What a bummer!    The other time I'd visited this location was not as bad as this - but still not as good at the Ahwatukee location.  There they are always consistent with great food and service.    This location does have a connecting bagel shop that has 6 different kinds of iced tea.  This was the saving grace of the meal - but now I am forced to sit at my desk and look at the trademarked slogan on the cup "Extraordinary Food for those unwilling to settle!"  Unfortunately today's meal was even less than ordinary...

Went to try it today at lunch and it wasn't open.  Went to Carly's Bistro instead (fantastic!).  Called the number for Scratch when I got back to the office and it was disconnected.  Guess it's closed?

Meh.   Stopped in for a quick lunch. It was not busy at all but I still had to wait a few minutes before anyone addressed me in line. I was the only one...   I ordered the special which was a chicken tostada and a drink.  The employee helping me seemed pretty disinterested in being there. She asked what beans I wanted and did I want chicken  then proceeded to dump a ton of beans and liquid on top of the corn crispy tortilla. When it was time to add the lettuce I said just a little lettuce. I got a ton!  She said is that okay and my reply was I guess if that's just a little. She also put a handful of cilantro - which is fine I like cilantro - but it was whole stalks of cilantro. It wasn't chopped and the stems were still intact. Weird. Guess I'm eating a salad today. Also she wouldn't look at me when talking so I couldn't hear anything she was saying. I had to keep asking her to repeat things since she was just looking away... At the cashier I had to wait another couple minutes again while the cashier wiped trays. Weird again- it's lunch time - could you please ring me up?! Got an iced tea for my beverage it tasted like it had been sitting for a while - it wasn't fresh. Tried the mint lemonade instead. That was actually really good.   The chicken had a good flavor but of course my tostada shell was soaked and soggy. I had to pick out a lot of the cilantro stalks and through all the lettuce to get to the good stuff.   I might say I'd give them another chance but this experience was so 'whatever' I don't think it'd be worth it.
