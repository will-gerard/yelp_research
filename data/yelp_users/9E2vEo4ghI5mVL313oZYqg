I have a spinal tumor which makes sleeping difficult. After a doc appointment last week that basically said I was hyperextending my shoulder due to the way I was sleeping, we went mattress shopping. I bought a mattress last week. I had it delivered yesterday. I couldn't even make it 1 night on the bed. I went to return it today...and have been given the run around.  Even though I was reassured by them that there's a 120 night comfort guarantee and can return it if I don't like it. I was told that I had to keep this mattress for 30 days minimum before I can exchange it, and that I could only exchange it for a similar model. This is in direct violation of the Uniform Commercial Code where I have 72 hours to return a product - particularly if that product is financed. After their extended warranties and mattress protector that I was assured I needed to protect the warranty and finance charges I'm expected to pay $4,256.00 for a $2,299.00 mattress that I slept one night on. They said they can't resell a used product and would be a 100% loss to them. Well, it's a 100% loss to me too. Who has more money to absorb that loss??  A big corporation or a consumer paying for cancer treatments, stroke treatments, and a spinal tumor(thankfully it's NOT cancerous but is still a spinal tumor nonetheless)? Apparently I'm just supposed to torture myself or go broke trying to just sleep. Thank you Conn's for putting yet one more burden on me.

Amazing customer service. AMAZING shaved ice made with real fruit! Homemade tortillas out of this world. Just wish they had more of a variety of fresh Mexican food and used fresh chips for their nachos. But the desserts are pretty amazing!

The food is absolutely out of this world and the staff is amazingly friendly. I'd have given 5 stars but they're always out of something when I go in there that I'm craving. I wish the full menu was available more often. But it's just that good they can't keep up sometimes! I can see why they run out! So if there's something particular you're craving, I suggest calling ahead
