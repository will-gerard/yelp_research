My first time at this restaurant was on a bad date.  I didn't drive at the time and since we were meeting at the restaurant, I took the bus and walked for about half an hour in the summer heat to get to the restaurant.  By then, my date had taken the liberty to order my meal.  The entree itself was a little pricey but scrumptious even with the terrible company.  (Might I add that he even asked if he could take my leftovers home.  Seriously, what?)  Anyway, since then I've been back way more times than I could count - with much better company.  Generally, I go for their weekend buffet which at $10ish per person, I say is a pretty damn good deal.  They don't have a huge spread for their buffet, but their items do not disappoint.  Their chicken tikka masala is by far my favorite item there, and goes perfect with the rice or the naan they bring to your table.  The fried vegetable fritters are amazing and I'm always a sucker for their desserts, especially these things that resemble donut holes but are drowned in syrup.  Oh and be forewarned (and this isn't at all a bad thing) that you might fall into a food coma after this buffet, so plan to get a cup of coffee or some other less sedentary activity so you don't immediately pass out the moment you reach home.  Trust me, I've fallen into that trap too many times, even when I thought I ate less than before.

My first visit to this steakhouse was a company lunch.  The sandwich I had was pretty darn good, the salads my coworkers got looked pretty decent albeit with too little meat proportional to the amount of veggies, in my opinion, but I wish my experience with this restaurant ended here.  After the luncheon, I decided to bring my boyfriend here for his birthday, and well, I was sorely disappointed.  That amazing sandwich I had had before wasn't on the dinner menu, but that's to be expected.  What truly annoyed me, and leads me to write this one star review, was the snooty service.  We were given the smallest table in the room, with servers walking right behind me, in and out of the kitchen, and treated as if our patronage didn't matter because we looked like college students.  Of course, they might just have had horrible service in general and our age had nothing to do with it because I did hear an elderly couple nearby complain about their service as well.  But hey, this was just my experience, and you might have better luck than I did.  Though I'd recommend The Keg over Stockyards any day.

So we're here, a lot.  And I keep telling myself we need to stop coming here cause...IhavenoselfcontrolandIovereatwheneverI'mhere.  There, I said it.  Also, to be honest, I'm hardly here for the salads.  It's the soups.  I want all of them; the chicken noodle, chili, clam chowder, corn chowder, broccoli cheese, some sausage soup that I can never remember the name of.  You name it, I've had it.  The pizzas/breads are amazing, especially with the recent addition of the BBQ chicken "pizza".  Mac and cheese, 'nuff said.  They have sweet potatoes and baked potatoes too if you're not full enough at this point.  And of course, desserts!  There's always room for dessert.  Or I'll make room.  Tapioca pudding (with chocolate syrup)!  Ice cream!  Chocolate lava cake or whatever's seasonal!  You get the idea, I love this place.  It's not top-notch food, but it definitely hits the spot.  Plus it's a buffet, it's cheap, the staff are really friendly, and it's quite possibly healthier than any other buffet you're going to find.  And don't forget to sign up for their mailing list!

I'm a sucker for carbs - burritos, rice, refried beans, you name it.  On a normal day, I'd get a burrito and be on my merry way but today I was greedy, and bit off more than I could chew (literally and figuratively).  I got a shrimp burrito meal.  I am stuffed and have no regrets.  Except that I realized on the way home, I forgot to get some of their amazing horchata.  Taking off a star cause of the girl at register who kept forgetting her previous sentence, and repeated everything at least twice.  If the food had been anything but amazing, this would have bugged the crap out of me, but thank god for their food.  It's been 4 hours - I'm still full.

Stopped by this Sunday morning at around 11AM.  There was a decent crowd but they seated the 5 of us in about 5 minutes.  Service was average - he got the job done.  But the food was good, and I am happy to announce that their servings are big enough for a brunch (it's a pet peeve of mine when places serve minute portions).  Two of us got the Euro Crepe Breakfast, which was a little on the smaller side but pretty damn good.  The Country Fried Steak was a Country Fried Steak, nothing out of the ordinary but came in a pretty decent sized serving, and extremely filling, so perfect if you're hungry.  I got the November special - Bandito Omelet.  It was delicious, and packed with flavors.  I highly suggest you switch out the toast for pancakes (which is what I did), and you will be stuffed.  Or have leftovers. Whatever works for you.  Definitely a must-try if you haven't stopped by yet - I'll definitely be back.

Having just bought our wedding bands, I don't think my fiance (I still need to get used to this!) and I have any authority to speak about the Lifetime Warranty but what we can attest to is their customer service.  Though the first sales lady we spoke with was juggling several customers and seemed in a bit of a rush running between all of us, she graciously handed us over to one of her colleagues (I believe it was Sonia) who was better able to walk us through the process, discuss our options with us, and finally deciding on the bands we bought.  She never rushed us even though it was right about closing time, taking the time to answer all of our questions, and always ready to bring us a handful of options that fit our budget and style.  What we can say about the Lifetime Warranty is that people love it.  While we were looking at wedding bands, a customer who had come in to get his ring cleaned/re-sized made it a point to tell us how happy he was with their service over the years.  From what I remember, the Lifetime Warranty includes free re-sizing for life, free cleanings, and re-appraisals of your ring.  Unfortunately, the re-sizing is only good for gold rings (maybe platinum too?  I don't recall) which bumped up the price tag for us a pretty little penny since the designs that he liked did come in titanium as well and would have just cost us a third of the one he finally decided on which was in white gold.  I'm not usually a jewelry girl (that can change though!) but if I did want to treat myself to something (or if someone *coughnudgecough* offered to buy me some...he isn't usually on Yelp so this will fall on deaf ears anywho), I'd definitely swing by Shane Co.  Even though I hate that 40 minute drive.

I've been here several times, being a former ASU kid and never quite moving out of Tempe.  They have great deals - those $7.99 sales (I feel like I've achieved crazy coupon lady status whenever I chance upon these), and the convenience of checking in on their website so that you can minimize your wait in-store.  I had long-ish (about mid-back) layered hair and just yesterday cut it into a long bob and I love it.  The lady (Alicia, I think) was a perfectionist and gave me wonderful advice on how to style my hair.  For instance, how I could hide the fact that my bangs were framing my face - something typical for layers, but not quite advisable for bobs, and how to get rid of those ugly duck tail edges, since it's at that awkward length where your hair follows the curve of your neck.  Taking off a star because my boyfriend's hair wasn't quite as stellar as mine, having his hair trimmed by somebody who literally graduated from cosmetology school a week ago.  There were several long strands that were missed and cause I am a little OCD, it took a tremendous amount of restraint on my part from plucking off those strands before we reached home and I could find a pair scissors.

When I was first introduced to the place a couple years ago, I thought this place was fantastic.  The slices were huge, there was always a huge selection of pizzas on display, and the wings were great.  But after about a year of going there, I kid you not, weekly, I started to see a drop in standard.  The pizzas weren't always warm, if you asked for say a mushroom slice, be prepared to get canned mushroom thrown on a reheated cheese slice.  The wings weren't always warm either, and sometimes lacked the sauce that once made these wings great.  Recently, I've noticed that they've gotten rid of the punch cards (I guess not many people were using them anyway), and my favorite honey-hot wings.  Instead, I was told that I could get honey-mild wings, or get hot wings and pay for a side of honey.  I'm going to stop myself here before I go on a rant, but that drove me over the edge and well, the only reason I'll be stopping by in the future, is out of nostalgia of the place this used to be.

I feel like I haven't written a 5 star review in a while and well, I think REI really deserves it.  I had done some research beforehand and heard that this weekend was their biggest sale of the year, being the Memorial Day sale along with their anniversary, so REI we went.  One thing was on the agenda, backpacks for a backpacking trip across Europe.  The store was crowded and the wall of backpacks were surrounded with people it was hard to see what was what.  If I had just gotten put off by the crowd and left, well, REI would not have gotten this 5 star review but one of the REI guys, Zach, came by and saved the day.  We shot Zach question after question, having never bought a pack before, with no clue of what to look for or even how to adjust the pack, and he patiently answered all of our questions in great detail and with the expertise that I can only imagine that he himself had done a Europe backpacking trip in the past.  He even told us when the next sales were since we didn't need the packs immediately and had some time to shop around.  Even though we walked out of the store empty-handed today, I feel a lot more knowledgeable about buying a pack and I can safely say we'll be getting ours from REI in the near future.

Whenever I stop by for lunch, there's always a line.  And you know what long lines mean: delicious, fresh food.  If the line is long (so, closer to the main door), the wait can be about 15-20 minutes, and plenty of time to change your mind from wanting a Brat, or maybe an Italian sounds better, or maybe the White Hot, nah I think I'll try a Sea Dog, or Polish?  No, Italian, yes, an Italian with fries and onion rings?  Just onion rings.  I'm indecisive, if you couldn't tell.  Their most recent addition has been to add mac and cheese on your freshly grilled, and perfectly burnt (in a good way!) hot dog, for an extra 75 cents.  This and chilli, is the most amazing thing ever.  And don't forget to get some cheese on the side!  I might have to start attending cheese-aholic meetings, for the sake of my cholesterol (no, I refuse to see exercise as an option here).  Cut to the chase:  My favorite things about this place, the perfectly grilled hot dogs, great choice of toppings (only the cheese, mac and cheese, and chilli are an extra charge), and those Teddy Bars look so good!  Though I've yet to try one.  My only complaint is the wait, but I've noticed that Ted's isn't so busy at dinner.  I hope I didn't just jinx that

Oooh I love this place.  I used to frequent the Tempe location on Southern and McClintock, but yesterday was my first time at this particular location.  It's extremely nice and spacious, definitely a lot newer than my previous haunt but they seemed a little understaffed last night.  Maybe it was because it was a Thursday night, but there was only one girl running the register, showing the newbies how the place worked, and cleaning the dining area, while the other girl was cleaning up.  Needless to say, most customers who came in had to wait a while before being rung up.  Now on to the good stuff, the food.  How it works:  You walk in, pay for your meal - about $13 for dinner, grab a tray and a bowl, and fill it up!  It's like a buffet of raw food.  First are the meats which are frozen and thinly sliced, but you're provided with little paper sheets to help you push down the food in your bowl and stuff as much as you want in the bowl.  Then the veggies will take up pretty much all the space left in your bowl (if any), and finally your choice of three different types of noodles.  Honestly, I think loading up your bowl is an art.  Especially when you get to the noodles and you're faced with this balancing act of piling noodles on your tray, I mean bowl.  You also get to mix up your own fantastical, magical concoction of sauces (I might be having too much fun here) which you will then bring to the chef with your bowl/tray of raw ingredients and they'll fry it up all up right in front of you!  After you get your bowl back, now transformed and cooked to deliciousness, head over and get yourself some rice, soups, chips, drinks, and later (it's hard to resist) ice cream!  I know what you're thinking, how in the world am I going to stuff this into my tummy?  Doggy bags.  $0.50 per box, but so worth it cause you will have food for days.  Okay, like another meal or so.  So if you're a college student who loves food but is short on cash or just love a good deal, YC's is gonna be your new best friend.

This is ridiculous.  I used to go to the other Goodyear in the east valley.  They were good once - emphasis on the past tense.  I kept going to them out of convenience but today I chose my dignity over convenience and drove over to this Goodyear in Gilbert.  It was worth it.  I felt bad and didn't want to drag my boyfriend all the way out here so I chose to hang out in the waiting area while the good guys at the Gilbert Goodyear did a routine oil change.  I came prepared and brought an ample number of things to do for the hour I was gonna be waiting.  My appointment was at 5PM.  I was out on the road, on my way home at 5.27PM.  I almost had to pinch myself to remind myself it was real.  An oil change.  In under half an hour.  It can be done.  The sales manager told me two guys were working on it so I didn't have to wait for too long.  Thanks, guys.  :)  All in all, very nice and more importantly, hassle-free experience.  Scheduled my appointment online in the morning, came in for my same-day appointment, very pleasant staff/mechanics who all seem to work well together, no upselling, extremely courteous, and did I mention crazy efficient?  Forget convenience, this is my Goodyear now.

Being from ASU, I've been here umpteen times and though the thousands of reviews and the constant flow of college students in and out of this brewery already vouch for this, I'm here to reiterate that this place has amazing food.  It's better than any bar food I've had, huge servings, great fries, great beer, decent prices.  I personally like it better in the summer, when it's a lot less crazy, but for the food, I will brave the crowds.  Also, I've heard great things about the Pumpkin Porter so I'll definitely be back again in September.  Dishes I recommend: The nacho appetizer - there's lots of it and you won't regret adding meat to it.  The Reuben - my favorite and go-to item on the menu.  The fish and chips - my other go-to item.  The Italian beef beer bread - filling, cheesy, beef.  Need I say more?  Also, the Kiltlifter, the peach beer, and I'm sure many more that I've yet to try  Try at your own risk: Beer shake - didn't care for it.  It's the only milkshake on the menu.  Grilled chicken beer bread - it was rather dry and a far cry from the Italian beef beer bread

Over the years, I've been dragged from one pho place to the next by pretty much every single friend of mine and despite not being a fan of pho (even though everyone thinks I should be, being Asian and all), I feel like I can weigh in to say this place beats out the competition, hands-down.  Prices here are probably on par with other places but you most definitely get your money's worth, especially with the #1 (or Pho Xe Lua, so the online menu tells me) .  The broth isn't too sweet or too salty (this is starting to read like Goldilocks) and the portion sizes are good enough to satisfy me and all the bottomless pits I fondly call, my friends.  I've personally never had anything other than the pho here, but I've heard that #13 is pretty good, and the kung pao chicken was ordinary.  Though I'd never order kung pao chicken unless I was beaten and tortured into submission to eat at Panda Express.  The owner is also really friendly and always takes the time to talk to my boyfriend because he and his ex-roommates used to frequent the place 2-3 times a week.  Quick note, if you're planning on splitting the bill, bring some cash along cause there's a $10 minimum to use your card.  Or just add-on an iced coffee or if you're adventurous, the salted plum juice!

This being my first time rock climbing and having a tremendous fear of heights, I'm not gonna lie, I was a little apprehensive about the whole thing.  But we had a Groupon that was about to expire (that I had bought on one of my Groupon sprees) and my boyfriend assured me that it would be fun, so off we went.  And...it was actually a ton of fun.  Being a first-timer, the staff had us watch a safety video which though rather quiet, was later reinforced when a member of the staff walked us through how to secure the ropes, check each other's ropes, and of course, belay.  Once I had asked all the questions I needed, and assured that I was doing it right (cause, you know, my boyfriend's life was literally in my hands), we were all set!  They have some pretty interesting rock walls, with little tapes to identify the different paths which were of varying difficulty.  It wasn't too crowded when we got there around noon, but at about 1PM, it was becoming a bit of a feat to find a wall without someone right next to you.  We took turns climbing for about 2 hours, as that was about all our arms could take.  So all in all, great experience, great staff, big on safety, and I'll definitely be back!

Such a shame that the restaurant closes at 8 on Sundays cause I honestly felt really bad about getting there at 6 and felt like I had to rush through my dinner so I couldn't quite enjoy it as much as I wanted to, but regardless, their pizza is phenomenal.  The salads are okay.  I wasn't a fan, but it was an obligatory salad in preparation of feeling guilty for the next week or so cause of all the Thanksgiving feasting, so I ate it anyway.  We got the signature spinach pizza along with the meaty pizza, both in mediums, and it fed the 5 of us quite well (and trust me, we know how to feast).  The slices are cut in little squares which make it real easy to lose track of how many slices you've had.  That, and the fact that their pizzas have this delicious sweet sauce, giving their pizzas a unique taste you can only get at Spinato's.  And they are good.  So good that my boyfriend's brother came out from California last year to visit us, fell in love with Spinato's, and this year, made it a point to stop by Spinato's again this trip.  Definitely stop by if you haven't tried them already!

I love, love, love this place.  To be honest, this is my second time at a yoga studio, first time doing Bikram yoga so I'm going to frankly say I don't really have much to compare it with, but it has definitely made a great impression so far.  For any first-timers like me out there, each Bikram yoga class is 90 minutes long, a series of 26 poses, in a controlled 106 degree room (any regulars, feel free to correct me if I've mixed up the details).  And during these 90 minutes, you will ache from using all those muscles you never knew existed, and oh my god will you sweat.  They are not kidding when they tell you not to wear cotton.  I wore cotton yoga pants on my first class, and in my defense I had thought to myself, they're called yoga pants for a reason, so they'd be perfect, but nope, ditch the cotton.  And ditch the pants - by that, I mean wear shorts.  Girls, sports bras are great.  Guys, shirt or no, that's up to you - but if you're hot, (ha! pun intended) no shirt's cool.  ;)  As for the studio itself, the staff are great.  Really friendly, great vibe, and the instructors are very personable, extremely helpful, and always make it a point to walk around to correct your form if necessary, so no worries there!  There are huge wall-to-wall mirrors on two walls of the room, making it great for you to watch out for your own form as well as your profile.  The "classroom" is very spacious, easily fitting 40-50 people on a busy day, but it does get pretty humid during those classes.  So what makes me love this place?  You will definitely work up a sweat, you're all limbered up by the end of class, they have a great schedule and offer classes at pretty much all times of the day (so you don't have an excuse to miss class), they rent towels and yoga mats for $2 and sell a variety of drinks.  Basically, it's hard for you to tell yourself you're not gonna go for class even if you're in the area and didn't bring your mat or towel.  Perfect if you're like me and having trouble sticking to my New Year's Resolution to work out more...  Oh and if you bring 3 friends in, I think they pay $29 for their first month, and you'll get a $25 credit!  Now if only most of my friends didn't live over in West Phoenix...

Awesome food, love the murals, love the ambience, though the wait was a little long and there were two sizable flies hanging out on the window next to us that made me feel like someone in the vicinity was listening in on our conversation (I may have been binge-watching Ray Donovan recently, maybe).  We came out here for a celebratory lunch, were seated almost immediately, our waitress gave us a quick rundown of the popular menu items which was much appreciated since some of us were new to Barrio Cafe.  The choices were vast, and I was so torn between several menu items I ended up just going with the first thing that came to mind when the waitress asked for my order.  I wound up with the filetitto torta which was really reasonably priced ($16).  This is going to sound rather odd but I really appreciate the range of prices of their menu items.  You have things that are in the low teens, and some that go into the high twenties, making it accessible for people who are on a budget (like yours truly) and people coming in for special occasions such as anniversaries, birthdays, and the like.  The torta was amazing.  Huge piece of meat, topped with chorizo and I'm not sure what else cause I was too busy wolfing it down.  It looked glorious, for the short time it was on my plate.  I regret getting their spicy fries, not because they weren't good but because the salad looked so much better - I don't remember exactly what was in it (the dried cranberries did catch my eye), but it was definitely not your regular house salad.  My boss ordered the carne asada tacos which I actually almost ordered but am glad I didn't.  I guess they weren't quite as good since the response I got to "how were the tacos?" was "they weren't as good as yours looked".  My only gripe was that it seemed like we were waiting for our food for quite a while but maybe our order just took a little longer to cook so I'm not too bothered by that.  I'm definitely ordering their crepes next time I stop by cause damn, did they look good.  Pretty much all of us were eyeing the neighboring table's dessert the minute it came out, I'm not even kidding.  Maybe I'll just order that crepe as my main course.  Nope, I need to have that torta again. Or maybe try something new.  Hmm.

Being a city girl and not graced with the sure-footedness of a mountain goat, Camelback's Cholla trail was my first ever hike.  It was terrible back then, and muscles in my legs that I didn't know I had, hurt like no other the day after.  But here I am, four years later, still hiking the Cholla trail and I love it.  Parking is along the side of the road, and depending on the time of the day, the weather, and if school is in session, things can get pretty busy and parking can be an ordeal.  And to add to that, it is of course, parallel parking, a tremendous terror in itself.  If you're a brave soul, and hike during the summer, bring tons of water and aim to be done with the hike at 8.30-9AM. Any later, well your skin starts to burn, courtesy of the good ol' Arizona sun.  The trail itself is pretty busy, with regulars, what appears to be guided hikes, college kids, and dog lovers with their dogs.  In my opinion, this is great for beginners up for a challenge.  About a third of the way involves a fair amount of steps, nothing too hard.  Then comes the next third where the path narrows down to being just big enough for one person but is fairly flat.  And finally the last third, marked by the helipad, is the scramble.  I've never done this last third but I heard it gets pretty tough, making it comparable to Camelback's other trail, Echo trail.  So two thirds of the trail takes me about 1.5 hours at a leisurely pace, a decent hike to work up a good sweat.

I literally left Bobby Q's last night thinking, I need to bring anyone and everyone I know from out of town here when they visit us.  Here's why:  Almost immediately after seating us at the booth at the bar (the wait was 50 minutes for a table vs immediate for the bar), the waitress showed up to greet us and get our drinks, and soon after brought us their oh-so-delicious cornbread.  We were set on the Whole Hog Heaven, which was a choice of 4 meats and 3 sides, but seeing that it was only me and my boyfriend. our waitress (I feel terrible for not remembering her name) suggested the Sunday special called the Family Platter which was for $33, you get a little less meat than the Whole Hog, 4 pre-chosen meats: chicken, brisket, pulled pork, and baby back ribs, and 2 sides.  Less than 10 minutes after placing our order, our food was here with an extra helping of spicy BBQ sauce.  It was marvelous.  The mac and cheese was the creamiest, cheesiest, most delicious mac and cheese my 10 year old self could ever ask for.  The shoestring fries were miserably thin, but I'm just biased being a fan of steak fries.  The brisket simply melts in your mouth.  The pulled pork does too, but only as much as pulled pork can.  The chicken was a lot better than I expected and I hate ordering BBQ chicken.  Oh but those ribs, the meat just fell right off the bone.  We were starving walking in, but stuffed after polishing off everything but the ribs.  My boyfriend, who had every intention of eating all of it right there and then, took a bite of the ribs, announced that we were going to take it home.  It was that good.  And that much food.  My only regret was not getting more cornbread.  But I can't really blame them for not offering considering how quickly they brought us that sheer amount of food.  In a nutshell, great, quick, and very accommodating service (the couple next to us wanted rotisserie chicken without any BBQ sauce.  Baffling, I know), delicious food, and tons of it!  But be sure to make a reservation.  Oh, and have I mentioned those cinnamon-dusted donut bites?  Bobby Q, you've ruined me forever.  I used to be very content with my after-dinner mints but now I'm going to have to demand donut bites everywhere I go.

It's been a long time since I've stopped by Cornish Pasty, and...I have no idea why.  I could say I haven't been in the neighborhood as much, or that their lights are a little too dim for my liking, but those are nothing but excuses and as I write this review on an empty stomach, my mouth is watering at the thought of these pasties.  I think I know what we're having for dinner.  The menu and dining area have grown since the last time I had dined here.  It's no longer small and cozy, but a lot roomier but still holds the cozy vibe that I love.  Unfortunately, that involves the dimly lit room, but I always order more or less the same thing anyway and there's always the light from my phone if I needed to read the menu.  The pasties, needless to say, are delicious.  Think of something along the lines of a chicken pot pie, but shaped like a calzone.  And tastes way better.  You'll have to try them for yourself - they do not disappoint.  They do have a variety of beers on tap too, and I would highly recommend pairing one with your pasty!

I miss this place.  Nevermind the bare bones decor, and odd hours, but their food was delicious.  Great food, low prices, and good sized portions.  I was in the area the other day and decided to stop by.  And though the decals and signs were still on the window, it was closed - their website confirmed it.  Not to be melodramatic (yes, I'm gonna be melodramatic) but this place held a special place in my (stomach's) heart, please open up again soon.  I need those eggrolls.

It's your friendly neighborhood Costco!  I wouldn't call it the smiliest Costco in town but who cares, it's a Costco and you know the drill: cheap stuff in bulk, free samples, and any trip could quite possibly end in you buying a TV.  They generally round up samples at about 5PM, with the weekends having the most variety but weekdays providing bigger portion sizes.  Saturdays and Sundays are insane.  It's Phoenix, so people don't really get the idea of crowds.  The giant carts don't necessarily help the situation either when you have people standing in the middle of an aisle, cart parked diagonally across a lane.  Regardless, amazing deals, free samples, cheap food, cheap pizzas, and it's a friggin' Costco - you'll love it.

I've heard that their tamarind soup is phenomenal but I wanted to be adventurous and get something different and you know what, this was one of the times I wish I hadn't.  I had the V6 (one of the vermicelli salad noodle bowls with an eggroll and garlic pork) cause somebody had uploaded a picture of it on Yelp and it looked so delicious.  Or maybe I just thought it looked delicious cause I was starving, so that's what I got.  It was bland.  And I was disappointed.  I don't really have much else to say about this place cause I was just so upset at how bland my food was.  If I ever go back, I will try their tamarind soup, but I'm sorry, nothing else.

Ordered their milk tea which was a little too sweet for me but their bobas were cooked just right and the staff were nice, friendly, and efficient - my drink was ready in no time.  If you're only getting one drink, bring cash cause there's a $5 minimum for plastic.  I'll definitely be back for something less ordinary than milk tea - there are so many choices to choose from!

It's just your typical cheap Asian buffet.  A little on the pricey side at $16-ish per person for their dinner buffet though I'm sure you'll hear some say that it's worth it because they serve crab.  But don't be fooled, the crab is immediately snapped up by the vultures circling the empty tray, waiting for the next tray of crab.  Last time I was there, literally three people got any crab before the tray was empty once again.  Have fun waiting another 20 minutes before they bring out the next tray, only to see it all disappear to one or two tables.  That aside, the sushi isn't great and the dim sum dishes have too much dough with too little fillings.  They do have a variety of your standard Asian dishes, but all of sub-standard to mediocre quality.  It is a cheap buffet, so I guess I can't complain too much there.  The service is a hit or miss, depending on the waitress and a tip to all, don't use their bathrooms.  They don't always refill their soap, and I have seen roaches in their bathroom.  At least it's the bathroom, I guess.

First off, pricing as of February 16th, 2015: Weekday lunches: $9.88 + tax Weekday dinners: $16.88 + tax Weekends (all day): $17.88 + tax  Okay so I kinda ditched this place for a while cause I didn't think their dinner buffets were all that great for what you're paying but since it's President's Day and I get a Monday off, I decided to check out their weekday lunch buffet.  Honestly, I don't know if everything seemed better cause of our really nice waitress Lisa, or if it was the significantly cheaper ($8 cheaper to be precise) price tag, but I finally see why people rave about this buffet.  With the exception of not having any crab legs, you get the same variety and choices at the weekday lunch available to you on the weekends.  There are about 40-50 dishes available, the food was fresh, and you can get your usual fix of orange chicken, teriyaki chicken, broccoli beef (admittedly with way more broccoli than beef), some seafood, some Korean barbecue meats, and even some dim sum.  I honestly think the quality of the dim sum has improved cause the little custard buns definitely had more custard that I remembered, and the barbecue pork buns (char siew buns) definitely had a lot more meat than on my last visit a few months back.  They also have a sushi bar where the sushi is freshly prepared in front of you, but if it's sushi you want, do yourself a favor and get all-you-can-eat sushi at Mido Sushi cause the sushi at Pacific doesn't quite cut it.  Now on to desserts.  Not impressed.  I realize all Chinese buffets have similar desserts but the cakes just don't do it for me.  They don't look great and taste like a heap of sugar.  That said, go for the ice cream right next to the dessert table.  They generally have about 8 flavors to choose from, two of which are some sort of sorbet, a chocolate, a strawberry, a vanilla, a mint chocolate chip, a cookies and cream, and a green tea.  Green tea was the obvious favorite with there being barely anything left when I hit the ice cream bar at about 1PM today.  In a nutshell: Lunch is great, at $9.88 (it rhymes!).  The crab legs aren't worth the extra $8 and that's only available at dinner.  Enjoy!

The only thing stopping me from giving Lucille's five stars, is my love for Bobby Qs, but that's for another review.  Lucille's is hidden away in the back lot of Tempe Marketplace but that has not in the least hindered their business.  What we got: Fried pickles, they came in wedges not slices and it was phenomenal except for the bit where the juice from the pickle will burn your mouth if you're not careful.  I wasn't too impressed by their wings and probably wouldn't be getting them again.  For our entrées, we had 1) salad, which seemed nothing out of the ordinary.  2) A full rack of baby back ribs, dont even bother getting half a rack cause its never worth it. It comes with two sides and I was impressed that they give you an entire ear of corn instead of a third of one.  But I may be biased but Bobby Q's ribs are better, sorry Lucille.  3) The tri-tip sandwich was pretty damn amazing, though I was a little disappointed that it was on a regular burger bun especially after I saw the dressed up steak sandwich.  4) The steak sandwich was great in what I think was ciabatta and covered in arugula.  For me, what bumps them up from a 3 star to 4 star joint, is their service.  They had made a mistake with the steak sandwich and slathered mayo on both sides of the bread though we explicitly told them not to.  But when we brought it up to them, they immediately offered to replace it, took it off our bill, and to top that off, dessert was on the house.  We took up their offer and got the apple beignets which had too little apple for my liking but was a treat nonetheless.  All in all, amazing experience and I'll definitely be back!

All you can eat sushi for $20.  And good sushi at that.  If that doesn't at least make you want to give this place a shot, well, shame on you.  First of all, they bring you a sashimi plate out to start, before you place any sushi orders to get you on your way to sushi heaven.  I'm not a sushi connoisseur, but of all the sushi joints I've been to in the valley, this place, by far, has the best sushi.  The fish is fresh, the rolls made right there by the chefs behind the counter, and they have this amazing green tea ice cream to help you wash down your meal (of course, you can have their mango ice cream or red bean ice cream instead, but I personally love the green tea ice cream).  My only complaint is that after the first or second round of sushi, the waitress sometimes seems to make herself scarce, making it a little difficult to put in your next order of sushi.  So be sure to get in most of your sushi orders in the first or second order!

Still giving this place 4 stars because their sushi is downright amazing, but being a long-standing customer here, I'm still confused about how their all-you-can-eat sushi works.  We stopped by last night, and as an appetizer, we got a small salad and edamame, but no sashimi plate that I had mentioned in my last review.  And we weren't offered ice cream at the end of the meal either.  Also, although it was advertised as $19.99, it's really $21.99.  Not a big deal, but I did scowl slightly at my receipt.  Unlike other days, they were very prompt about getting our second round of sushi, and this, I fully appreciate.  I guess in summary, don't expect anything other than what you order, but if on the off chance you do get a sashimi plate for an appetizer and ice cream for dessert, you're in for a treat.

It's a Best Buy.  The layout is more or less the same.  Their stuff is generally stocked and easy to find.  I don't often get much attention walking around the store, which is fine when I'm browsing, but it'd be really nice to be able to find an employee when you need one.  Sometimes I wish there'd be a map telling you where all the employees are so we can actually find them if we have a question.  I might be referring to a real-life Marauder's map here.  Maybe.  Bottom line, Amazon is still my preferred "stop" for electronics.

In all honesty, I wasn't expecting a whole ton when my boyfriend brought me here for our anniversary.  (Now before I sound like a terrible girlfriend, in my defense, it's in Tempe Marketplace next to BevMo and Red Robin - not where I'd expect an outstanding steakhouse.)  But boy, was I wrong.  The steak was amazing.  I'm not gonna pretend to be an expert on steaks, but I thoroughly enjoyed mine.  It was very juicy, and tasty on its own - mind you, this is coming from someone who douses every steak she's ever eaten in A1.  Although they do seem to count the number of green beans they put on your plate (5, if I remember correctly), but it's not like anyone's there for the veggies.  I'd also highly recommend the twice baked potatoes for a side if you're not calorie conscious, and even if you are.  The service too, was exceptional.  Not in your face, but there when you needed them.  They had taken note that it was our anniversary, so every waiter and manager that came by made it a point to wish us, even remembering how long we had been together (I was a little taken aback, honestly).  Oh!  And they also served us this amazing cheesecake, on the house, since we chose to celebrate our anniversary with them.  I was stuffed as it is, but you know how girls are with desserts.  That said, I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a decent steakhouse in this college town.  Like any decent steakhouse, it is a little on the pricey side, but well worth it.

So.  Much.  Food.  So naturally, yes, I loved it.  The Original Gyro is a gyro, packed with meat and with a crapload of fries.  Or salad, if you're into that.  If you're a big eater, get the platter.  For two bucks more, you get basically another entire gyro, along with a full plate of salad.  Food was tasty, and the service was quick and very personable - he came by to serve us our food and even stopped by to check on us and how we were liking our food, a very nice touch for a fast food place (I'm not sure if this falls under the fast food category, but it's not a sit-down restaurant, so let's just go with that).  It's a little out of the way for me, but definitely worth the drive!

Disclaimer: This review is solely for their boba. For some reason or another, I've never eaten here (generally cause we're at Mekong for dim sum and stop by after, when we need our post-dim sum boba). Anyway, back to the point, I can't speak for their food, but I do love me some of their boba.  I believe they're one of the few places which offer red bean and green bean slushes. The hubby loves red bean and what keeps us coming back is that they really do blend up actual red beans, none of the powdered stuff. I usually go for whatever I'm feeling for the day and I haven't found one that I didn't like. My most recent discovery is their green bean slush which is actually fairly similar to their red bean slush in that they're both made from actual beans with the red bean slush being on the sweeter side.  Unlike other boba shops in the valley, they don't charge you extra to make it a slush. Boba's 50 cents extra and an upgrade to a large is a dollar more. Their regular runs between $2.50 and $3. Pretty reasonable and in my opinion, better than the boba shop next door!

I love this place.  Granted I've only tried two things on their menu, but these two items are so good, I can't bring myself to order anything else.  The Lunch Special is a great deal if you're stopping by for lunch and the Paradise Special is basically the same thing but with an extra serving of meat (I forget which one) and is available all day.  Now for a quick rundown of the pros and cons of this place:  Pros: Tastes amazing - I've heard tons of people comment that it's pretty authentic Hawaiian food.  Lots of food - 3 servings of meat for the Lunch Special, 4 servings for the Paradise Special, 2 scoops of rice, and your choice of 4 sides (I always get the macaroni salad, bean sprouts, kimchi, and noodles).  And did I mention, the food tastes amazing?  (Minor, minor) Cons: Closed on Sundays, when I crave it the most.  25 cents for a take-out box and though I don't drink that much soda, it only has one free refill for drinks.  Oh and their spam musubi, wonderful if you love spam and still somehow have room for more food after the sheer amount of food they give you.

I read somebody's review saying that it was a little suspicious that every review on the Simply Dentistry's Yelp page was a five star review and I really wanted to make this a four star review to make it known that they weren't fake reviews but I physically can't bring myself to do that.  Simply Dentistry deserves five stars, not four.  I've been coming here for two years now and I'm not gonna lie, my experience here wasn't always smooth.  We had a little billing hiccup back when I first started coming here and I am ashamed to say I kicked up a bit of a fuss. But Dr Tran and her staff handled it really well, and here I am, making my twice yearly visits to the dentist (shoutout to John who puts up with my fickleness when it comes to when I want to schedule an appointment), even getting work done as necessary (okay, I still drag my feet about that sometimes, but I got it done eventually!).  I know this isn't something to brag about but I hadn't gone to the dentist in 5 years before I saw Dr Tran so I think it's safe to say her and her wonderful staff definitely changed me.  So for anyone out there who's in the market for a new dentist, definitely give Simply Dentistry a try!  You won't regret it, I promise.  Did I mention they have TVs with DirectTV on the ceiling so you can watch some TV as they work on your teeth?  And Dr Tran maintains this awesome garden out back - it's really cool!  There are even brussel sprouts and strawberries back there.  I'm jealous, Dr Tran.  Jealous.

Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love Yogurtland.  In my opinion, they beat Mojo's and all the other yogurt places hands down.  They have more flavors, more toppings, fancy water (with strawberries floating in them), cool spoons, and yogurt prices that aren't too harsh on my wallet.  Also, I think they have a more ice cream-like texture but since it's yogurt, I can lie to myself that this might actually be healthier than the tub of ice cream I have sitting in the freezer. But all that aside, I give this location in particular, 1 star.  So sometimes at the Tempe location, about half the yogurt dispensers are down. Fine, it's a high traffic location, machines need some care too. Whatever, I can deal with less flavors. Sometimes the toppings aren't stocked. Sure, I don't need any more than a scoop of this and a scoop of that.  Again, not a big deal.  Most of the time, the crew has yogurt stains on their shirts.  Again, whatever.  The machines are down, they need to be fixed.  Yogurt accidents are inevitable.  But this was the final straw.  BUGS.  The tiny flying ones that love to swarm at you in the evenings.  The ones with green, translucent wings.  And other unidentifiable bugs that I just call gross.  On all of the toppings.  On the sneeze guards, on the spoons, in the toppings, on the fruits.  So now I drive the extra 5 or so miles to the Scottsdale or Chandler location to get my Yogurtland fix.  I told you I love Yogurtland.  Just not this location.

I've only been here for eyebrow threading, and as we all know, them eyebrows can make or break your face.  And they've done a pretty good job at keeping me from looking like Frida, or a preteen's first meeting with a pair of tweezers.  So yes, I trust them with my face.  The ladies are really efficient, pleasant, and professional.  At worst, I waited 20 minutes for my appointment but I wasn't in a rush so it didn't bug me too much.  My main gripe is that at $14 they're pricier than most but it is $9 if you're a new customer, so at the very least give them a shot!

Gonna keep it short(ish) and simple today.  Arrived at 6PM on a Sunday, and to say that parking is extremely limited is an understatement.  The restaurant itself is small, which explains why there weren't too many parking spots.  It was a 45 minute wait for a table for two so we ordered takeout instead.  A little crammed and loud with people talking over one another, but it was actually pretty cozy.  The staff were really nice, pleasant, and efficient even with the crowd and gave us little lids for the salsa, along with our horchata, after we placed our order.  Fast forward through standing around awkwardly in what felt like everyone's way for 20 minutes in the restaurant, we had our burros in hand - an Al Pastor burro and La Santisima burro (chicken).  The burros are pretty sizable and scrumptious.  The salsa bar is probably what sets this place apart from the rest.  It's fun and most of them have a little kick to it, so have a glass of water nearby.  I loved their horchata, it's a little sweeter than other horchatas, has more cinnamon, and the fruits (strawberries) are a great touch.  Definitely will be back, probably for takeout.

What I love about Half Price Books (having just stopped by Changing Hands down the street) is that it doesn't feign to be modern, quirky, or fancy.  It's, in my opinion, an old school, used bookstore for people who simply love books.  The smell of books, the wooden bookshelves, tons and tons of books, a humble, cosy atmosphere, a clearance section for books under $3.  It was glorious, and everything I was looking for.  Unfortunately, I was in a rush and only had 15 minutes to spend here, but I'll definitely be back.

Up until today, I had been a long standing supporter of Hogwash, but their most recent price hike has got me looking for someplace else to wash my car.  I remember back in 2010 when a regular car wash was $3 with your student ID.  Then in 2011 they got rid of that deal, and a car wash was a minimum of $5, but the Student Discount Handbook (I think that's what it's called) always had pretty decent coupons so I came back.  Then last year (if memory serves), they re-did their "menu", offering a $3 wash but it didn't include soap, just basically a hose down with a giant brush to scrub the dirt in.  But the coupons were still out there - a $10 wash for $5.  So again, they had my business.  Today, I noticed the sign no longer said "$3 car wash" but "3 minute car wash".  It didn't quite click that it meant that they had gotten rid of the $3 wash, but low and behold, the cheapest car wash available was now $6.  Great that you've got free vacuums but there are tons of other places who have car washes under $5 in the vicinity, with free vacuums.  Sorry guys, I'm sick and tired of all the price hikes.

How it works: 1. Grab a sample cup, or two. 2. Try the flavors that sound interesting but you don't necessarily want to commit to. 3. Grab a real bowl. 4. Mix ALL OF THE FLAVORS!  :3  Of all the yogurt chains I've been to, this is my favorite.  The yogurt is smoother and creamier than most *coughMojo'scough*, and there are always new seasonal flavors to spice things up.  The staff at this location are extremely polite, the toppings are always fully stocked, their machines are hardly ever down.  Right now, they have several seasonal flavors like Pumpkin Pie, Rocket Pop, and Pudding Pop, on top of the year-round favorites like Red Velvet, Coconut, Taro, and Key Lime Pie, to name a few.  I love the toppings and it takes a fair bit of self-restraint on my part not to just completely load up my cup with fruits and brownie bites (I know they don't go together - I'm a rebel like that).  And don't forget to ask for a rewards card, they have pretty sweet (pun intended) deals!

Free flow of garlic naan and mango lassi with the buffet. I rest my case. Seriously though, those two items alone won me over but of all the Indian buffets I've been to, and I've been to a few, they serve up the most variety, catering to both vegetarians and carnivores. Of course, they serve up some pretty awesome desserts (I call them donut holes soaked in syrup, but I'm sure it has a name).  Having been to other buffets which advertise having a free flow of naan, I was a little skeptical when I read this on their website. It's like going to Chompie's on St. Patty's Day and ordering their unlimited corned beef dish - after one dish, your waitress disappears. Let me make this clear, not here. At the India Oven, they are on top of it. Are you out of garlic naan? Never fear, that garlic naan is coming right your way. And you definitely want that second or third round of garlic naan. Never mind the garlic breath, it's so worth it.  At the buffet table, I honestly much prefer the meat dishes. You can easily find large pieces of lamb or chicken in the curry and get more than your fair share of protein. What bugs me (minor as this is) is that the basmati rice is in the middle of the buffet table. I'm a little OCD about my rice being on the bottom of my plate and having it drown in curry so I had to cut a couple people off and backtrack to the start of the buffet table to load up on the curry. Just a little pet peeve but heck, it didn't make my food taste any less amazing. They had tandoori chicken, chicken tikka masala, a chicken curry, and I believe two types of lamb curries which I thoroughly enjoyed. I even fancied the lentils over in the vegetarian section - look at me, eating vegetables and stuff.  Desserts - I've never seen this many desserts at an Indian buffet. At other buffets, you would have 2-3 desserts to choose from but if memory serves, India Oven gives you a choice of 4+ desserts. Of course I had to have them all, never mind the food coma that was about to hit. - there's always room for dessert. Besides, there's some Indian tea to wash it all down. I might explode, but I'll take my chances.

So all this time I had thought there were three dim sum restaurants in the valley - Great Wall, Phoenix Palace , and C-Fu.  Today, I found out I was wrong.  There's one in freaking Mekong Plaza!  To think I've frequented Mekong sooo many times in the past and just glossed over the fact that they had an awesome dim sum restaurant.  We went on a weekday at around 11 and it was pretty empty so it wasn't too surprising that only three of the carts were out.  We had our drinks orders attended to pretty much the second we sat down but the carts took a little bit to make their way over to us.  Comparing Mekong Palace to the other three (Great Wall, Phoenix Palace, and C-Fu), their steamed cart was good, loved their siew mai, they didn't have har gow when they came by (frownie), the BBQ pork buns were filled with pork and gravy and were also light and fluffy - I'd eat the entire plate myself, don't judge me.  The desserts were a little cold but still good - the custard in their custard bun is a little more liquified than others that I've had, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and their egg tarts were eggy with the right amount of sweetness.  Honestly, since I havent stopped by Great Wall or Phoenix Palace in a while, I don't know how I'd rank Mekong Palace against them (sorry C-Fu, you no longer make the list), but you know what, I think this calls for some research, ie. I might just have to swing by to get more dim sum this weekend!

A little on the pricey side for a fast food joint, but so, so worth it.  I always get the Lil Hamburger or Lil Cheeseburger and I always have so many toppings on it I feel bad for the guy putting my burger together cause, man, trying to balance all that on this burger could not have been easy.  You have my utmost respect, kind sir.  And now you would ask, why don't I just order a regular Hamburger/Cheeseburger that has two patties instead of one?  The fries.  Specifically, those cajun fries.  Every time I order a large, I stuff my face and swear to myself that I'm ordering a regular next time.  Never happens.  And it's not like there aren't enough fries in the regular (they fill a water cup then add another scoop of fries in the bag), there are way too many fries for me, but I'm greedy.  This is why I'm never gonna get abs.  That and that thing called exercising.  It's a foreign concept.

It's been such a long time since we've been to Chou's Kitchen and it was as good as we remembered.  Between the two of us, we shared the beef stir-fry noodle (#26) and an order of beef pies (#100). The beef stir-fry noodle is everything you'd expect, thankfully with an ample amount of sliced beef. The beef seemed a little tough this time, but hey, still good. The beef pies, ohmylord, are to die for. Okay, they're a little on the greasy side, by that I mean these pies are dripping with oil with every bite. Just don't think about what these are doing to your arteries and savor each bite. Stop thinking.  Also, there's always a bit of comedy we take away from each visit to Chou's. Like I remember having one of the waitresses ask politely if I needed a fork cause it apparently was pretty clear that my chopstick skills were not, as the kids say, on point. Also, this time around, when my hubby picked up our order of noodles and beef pies, the lady had asked if he needed chopsticks. Yes please, two chopsticks, he replied. And the lady smiled "knowingly" as if to say, haha two chopsticks, we know you're really eating this all by yourself. He told me about it when he got home and we had a good laugh but I think going forward I should probably start picking up the food with him.

I'm gonna echo Dana's review here and say that it is really weird to review a fast food place, especially such a well-known one, but I've gotta give it to them, they've got good service.  The staff are always really friendly (sometimes overbearingly so), and the whole place is just family friendly in general.  They've still got those playgrounds that the Burger Kings of the '90s used to have (yeah, I used to love those...), they've got events going on every Tuesday night I think?  Just like family games and stuff.  It's not something that you'd expect at all from a business, but I don't even have kids and I think it's a really nice gesture.  The place is pretty clean and if you sign up for their text updates, they have freebies on certain days, but they're generally in the mornings, so I guess the early birds do get the worm.  Do I really need to review the food?  Everyone's had Chick-fil-A at some point right?  Yummy chicken, yummy salads.  Wish they hadn't gotten rid of that carrot and raisin side salad, but they did.  Waffle fries are the best, especially with the variety of sauces you get to choose from.  Anywho, like the cows say, eat more chikin!

I've found it. My go-to spot to satisfy all my Mexican food cravings. Honestly, my hubby had bookmarked Taquitos Jalisco months ago but every time he brought them up, I never was in the mood for it. But finally, finally, we made the 20 minute drive out and ooo boy, nevermind that Los Taquitos is 5 minutes away, I will make this trip because Taquitos Jalisco is that much better.  First off, on the outside, it doesn't look like much. But inside, it's clean, well-decorated, well-lit, and though it's on the smaller side, it definitely feels more cosy rather than cramped. The people are sooo nice too (unlike *cough* Los Taquitos) and their menu choices are ample.  I ended up getting the green chile burrito while the hubby got a plate. The taco on his plate was downright amazing, the taquito was well-hidden between the rice and refried beans so that was a pleasant surprise. Also, the rice and refried beans were piping hot. I mean it bugs me that every time I order a plate, by the time I get to the rice and beans, they're always, always, and I mean always, cold. And that bugs me. So even when i was done with my burrito and tried some of his beans, they were still more than warm.  My burrito was amazing. The hubby seemed to have enjoyed mine more than his own, but you know how it goes, the grass is always greener on the other side. I was exceedingly pleased with my burrito. Unfortunately, I got a little overexcited with this burrito that I forgot to take a picture of all that deliciousness. The tortilla isn't stupid thick either, which makes me feel less guilty about stuffing myself with them rice and beans.  In a nutshell, we'll definitely will be back!

Finally!  I've been meaning to check this place out since I saw the International Supper Club was gonna hold their UYE here and I managed to snag a Groupon (it's still out there, guys!).  Also, I had an idea of what pierogis due to my sample trips, I mean, grocery trips to Costco.  But those were frozen pierogis.  I wanted the real deal.  And these pierogis did not disappoint.  The two of us shared 12 beef pierogis and the smoked sausage plate with 6 farmer's cheese and potato pierogis, and I was stuffed.  Got all of them fried instead of boiled cause everything's better fried.  Look at the State Fair!  Case in point.  The pierogis are sizable too, might I add.  About 2.5 inches in diameter?  I don't know if I'd get the beef again because I was expecting slices of beef but it turned out to be really smoothly ground beef.  But those cheese and potato pierogis?  I could eat that all day.  Probably not the best idea for my waistline, but I'll deal with that later.  I'm really excited to try the dessert pierogis next time though!

So I'm usually one of those weirdos you might find camped at a coffee shop sipping on an Americano sans milk, sugar, or creamer.  So Dutch Bros, as popular as they were, never really was my cup of tea (see what I did).  But their service, delicious coffee, and the whole punch card thing got me hooked.  They pulled the 9 stamp deal on National Coffee Day and since I needed my coffee at uhm 9PM at night, I swung by and got myself a swanky new punch card.  And an amazing coffee.  And great spontaneous service.  And some dubstep.  (Insert dubstep sounds here.)  I love their customer service, how the employees come out in the sweltering heat to take orders when the drive-thru line wraps round the parking lot, always seem to be enjoying themselves, and make it a point to strike up a conversation.  They definitely make a sweet cup of joe and I thought it would take some getting used to but boy oh boy was it good.  I've since found a happy medium asking for my iced coffees to be half as sweet.  It's still pretty sweet in my opinion but the extra sugar on top of all that caffeine helps me behave like a functioning adult on Mondays, or Tuesdays, or any day I get less than 5 hours of sleep.  PS.  If you're not a huge fan of coffee but need that caffeine boost, I say go for anything that has caramel in it (for example, the Caramelizer or Pocahontas).  The chocolate-y ones like the Annihilator are gonna taste more like coffee with a hint of chocolate rather than the other way around.  They also have teas and smoothies but I'm a heavy (coffee) drinker so I haven't tried those yet.

Clean and they keep things simple with only 4 items on their menu - so it's great if you're like me and really indecisive.  But ever since they've opened, I feel like their chicken strips have been shrinking.  I remember stopping by the first month they were open and those chicken strips were tv-worthy - think big, juicy, chicken tenders, with minimal batter.  But now, they've shriveled and look like they came from a sub-par kid's meal.  I still stop by from time to time to get my fix of chicken strips, but I make sure to lower my expectations before walking in so I'm not entirely disappointed.

I am in love with this place!  Tucked away in a little business center on the northwest corner of Mill and Baseline, Laughing Buddha is a hidden gem.  I know, I know, the phrase "hidden gem" is such an overused cliche, but you don't even want to know how many times I've circled this business center only to realize I made a wrong turn and Laughing Buddha is across that median that my little car has no horsepower to drive over.  I'll get myself a Jeep one of these days to solve this problem.  Learning to navigate is overrated.  Back to the point, your first class at Laughing Buddha is free.  After which, they offer you an unlimited one month pass or a 10 class pass at the Groupon rates.  I'm pretty sure no other studio in the valley does this.  Oh and even if you already bought a Groupon before stopping by, they don't start your pass til your second class.  That gesture in itself just gave me such a good vibe about this studio.  The classes are downright amazing.  Power Hour and Vinyasa will get you moving and quite possibly dripping.  Relax & Unwind will get you oh so relaxed you'd want to melt into the ground (but don't, cause you probably need to drive yourself home).  And their newest offering, Yogalates, ohh it burns...in a good, Pilates way!  I haven't gotten the chance to check out all of the classes but I've loved every single one I've stopped by for so far.  The classes are always interactive and taught with a sense of humor.  I love how all instructors make it a point to adjust you if necessary, and will also demonstrate to the class most of the moves - something which I found was actually pretty rare in the other studios I checked out.  To sum it up, get your yoga on at Laughing Buddha!  Oh did I mention that they have mats in the studio in case you forget yours?  Unlike some other studios, there isn't a "rental" fee to use them either!

I'm not gonna lie, I might have stalked this place a little on Yelp...and Groupon.  Yet despite all my high expectations of the place, I was not let down.    First and foremost, it was warm.  We stopped by after dinner and ran from the car to the shop in what felt like the freezing cold but walking into this shop was like walking into a nice warm hug.  With desserts.  The decor is cute, but there isn't too much seating so it's not so great for big groups, but the lack of tables does give it a more spacious feel.  I was only interested in the shaved ice (until I saw the brick toast) so I was only focused on the rightmost panel of the menu.  There are an ample number of options but not so many that it's overwhelming.  Basically, you choose the shaved ice of your choice, depending on the size that you order, you get a fixed number of toppings (with an extra $.50 for each additional topping), plus a drizzle.  I got a medium taro, with red bean, grass jelly, and black sesame drizzle.  The shaved ice was light and fluffy, a little less than two tablespoons of each topping (not quite enough in proportion to the shaved ice, in my opinion), and that delicious black sesame drizzle.  I couldn't get enough.  My boyfriend got the medium honeydew, with red bean, mochi, and condensed milk.  I have to say that the honeydew is a lot more flavorful than the taro, but it all depends on what you're in the mood for.  Will I be back? Yes, yes, and yes.  To try all the flavors, and that brick toast - it looked gorgeous.

Updaaate! My last review of Snoh's was based on my first taste of this awesome Taiwanese dessert. Since then, I've been out there, I've seen things, I've lived...What I really mean is that I've tried other places in both Arizona and California alike which also serve boba and this delicious shaved ice concoction. Though they all have things that I like and dislike, Snoh Ice Shavery ultimately prevailed.  Price-wise, they're all pretty much on par. I honestly feel like you get more snoh at Snoh's because most other places will serve you your dessert on a plate, whereas Snoh's will pack it down into a cup for you. So it may seem like you're getting more on a plate at these other places, but really, it's fluff. Plus, of the places I've been to, Snoh's is way more generous with their toppings which I really appreciate since I think the different toppings really add different textures and flavors to your dessert. I love Snoh's variety of flavors and toppings, and they always manage to keep things fresh by coming up with seasonal toppings or flavors which are handwritten on a little whiteboard next to the register. (I personally am waiting for them to bring in red bean snoh, which I've seen at other places but have yet to see at Snoh's.) Their decor is pretty awesome, with their walls covered in pop culture themed artworks and two flat screens playing some sitcom or movie from the '80s or '90s. It's definitely a spot to hang out at, with games from your childhood, scattered at the various tables. The crowds come in waves so I don't really have any recommendations on the best time to check this place out, but if you're in the mood for some shaved ice this Summer (or anytime, really), definitely give Snoh's a shot!

I really can't say too much as I just stopped by for a routine machine car wash, and vacuumed my car myself.  I do like that the vacuums are on both sides of the car but am a little confused as to whether I'm supposed to vacuum my car before the wash or loop back around after the wash (which is what I've been doing).  It's just a layout thing that bugs me a little.  However, kudos to the staff who seemed pretty friendly with one of them rushing up to the "self-checkout" machine to make sure I was doing alright, another taping down my back windshield wiper before heading into the tunnel of terror, I mean, machine wash, and another who pushed my side mirror back into place after it was flipped backwards after the machine wash.  They're small things but they definitely add up.

One of the newer generation QTs, meaning it has a soft-serve bar!!  And for those of you who have never stepped foot in a QT, they offer a truckload of drinks, coffees, donuts, hot dogs, the works.  A one stop shop for all your roadtrippin' needs!  Seriously though, gas prices here are pretty reasonable too.  Git ova hiya (get over here), stat.

I know I'm gonna make a lot of enemies with this review but here goes.  It doesn't quite live up to the hype.  Having gotten rave reviews from the local paper and from the community in general, always be prepared to wait about an hour to get a table.  The food is by no means bad, but with the exception of their daily special, their selection is ordinary - this took me by surprise considering how many people rave about the place.  On top of this, the service hasn't been great.  The only time we've had decent service was when the waitress was trying to flirt with my friend, which was honestly rather amusing.  That aside, they do make pretty good pancakes and if you do really insist on seeing what the hype is all about, I advise you to stop by within an hour of opening to avoid the wait.

They're open Saturdays!  This is huge for me cause I hate running down to the optometrist after work, especially when you're making this huge decision of choosing a new pair of glasses  (I'm a fickle one).  I came from another optometrist and they gladly took my prescription, gave me a rundown on what I was covered for and let me pick a pair.  Their selection wasn't exceptionally large, but there were definitely a lot of trendy glasses to choose from.  The lady who helped me out, though new, was very knowledgeable on the special discounts my provider had and was very willing to give opinions (without being pushy) on the different frames I tried on.  She even patiently walked me through all the different options of the different types of transition lenses (god, I was so confused, given that I'm not a morning person, and it was about 9.30AM at the time) and I made it out a-okay!  I'm still waiting on my new glasses but did call in to place an order of contacts - very convenient, pay at pick-up (for the contacts, that is), and was ready in 2 days!  Can't wait for my new glasses!  8D

Let me start off with the fact that it's been a stressful past couple of months and now that I have some sort of breather, I've been doing uhm a lot of retail therapy.  Wait, what am I doing, I don't need to justify my shopping habits.  By a long shot, Phoenix Premium Outlets is my favorite outlet mall in Phoenix.  First of all, it's an outlet mall.  So on any given day, you're gonna be saving on brands like Kate Spade, Coach, Under Armor, Naturalizer, Banana Republic, Gap, Calvin Klein, Famous Footwear, and basically all the big names you see at the bigger outlet malls in California, but not at the ones out here.  Plus it's the holiday season, so dear god, are they slashing prices - I live in mortal fear that the minute I make a purchase, they're gonna mark it down another 20-50%.  Oh trust me, it's happened.  Tip for the shopaholic in you (it exists, don't even try to deny it): Don't hesitate to ask when the sales are, if this is the best price you're gonna get for this wallet or jacket you're eyeing.  More often than not, the sales person will know when the best markdowns are and can let you know if you should wait or to just buy it nowww.  And don't forget to sign up for their emails if you don't mind selling your soul, I mean giving up your email for amazing deals and promotions.  Seriously, Kate Spade just sent out an email last week saying they were taking 50% off all bags and wallets, and another 20% on top of that.  Guess who bought a new bag.

Conveniently located in Mekong Plaza, guess where we stopped by for an impromptu dessert stop after getting some dim sum!  Reasonably priced with a large variety of drinks, I got myself a taro milk tea with boba and it cost me just $3.75!  I should have just gone with the large.  It was so good but I absolutely hate how the ice traps the boba when you're done gulping down your drink, but that's no fault of theirs.  Or maybe it is, cause if the tea wasn't so delicious, well I wouldn't have gulped it down and had this problem, would I?  Hmmm...  Oh and apparently they sell this snow dessert too, which I've only had at Snoh's Ice Shavery in the past, so next time I stop by, I might give that a try!  On a side note, I really wish I had painted my nails purple to match my taro milk tea.  Maybe add a couple black dots of nail polish to the tips of my nails so each nail looks like a cup of boba tea.  I digress.

When your friend who makes fry bread, vouches for this place and says it's the real deal, you go down there and check this place out.  And that's exactly what I did.  It is mosy definitely good, greasy, junk food.  In oh so glorious fry bread.  Some of their items are a little pricey, the honey and sugar fry bread, for one, but it sounds and tastes so good, you suck it up and order it anyway.  The flavors are overflowing, both figuratively and literally as the tacos mostly fall apart the second you try to pick it up.  They do provide a fork and knife to help with this, but don't do that, use your fry bread and scoop everything right up even if it makes your taco fall apart again.  My only little gripe is that although I taste the meat, the texture of it reminds me of refried beans.  Still good, nonetheless, and I'll definitely be back.

It's like a buffet.  On your pizza.  Buffet.  And pizza.  Do you realize how amazing this is??  Okay, so if you couldn't already tell, buffets and pizzas are a few of my favorite things (cue the Sound of Music).  You can throw on anything and everything you want on this thin crust pizza, from pesto sauce, alfredo sauce, fresh mozzarella, feta, to sausage, artichoke, sun-dried tomatoes.  Everything and anything, it's yours.  For eight bucks.  It's your own invention, your own delicious creation, baked to perfection, and if you can't finish it, there are take-out boxes cleverly designed to store exactly half a pizza.  This place is the work of a pure genius.  As much as I want to be a selfish little brat and keep this discovery myself, it's too good - they deserve the business.  Enjoy!

To be honest, when I first passed by this Bosa location, my first thought was "WHAT HAPPENED TO BARRO'S?!"  Then I realized it was Bosa and everything was okay in the world again.  I love their crazy hours cause I managed to grab two dozen on the way to work and oh my god, did it smell amazing.  As soon as I opened the door of my car, in came wafting the smell of donuts.  The lady was crazy efficient in filling up the two boxes in under a minute.  Also kudos to her and whoever else who works that shift cause the morning sun comes flooding in, right into the store.  I mean, if I were in their shoes, I'd be wearing sunglasses indoors, I don't care if you think I'm a dbag.  All the donuts were fully stocked and were still really soft when I got to work.  Le coworkers were pleased and so was I.  Yay Bosa!

Bosa, I deem thee my go-to place for all my late night donut cravings!  Bosa's affordable, with a dozen donut holes often going for 99 cents, always serving up the fluffiest, lightest donuts that will leave you craving more but...I wish they had a wider variety of donuts.  I don't think you'll find anything here that you can't find at any other donut shop, and with my late night donut cravings/habit, I'm usually left with only a handful of choices to choose from (though that's more my fault than theirs).  Still love them over many other donut shops in the area, mainly cause of their late hours and all of the fluffy donuts!

Top notch food (apparently they have a renowned chef), decent service, prices are as fancy restaurants go, great ambiance, I love it.  You really can't go wrong with anything on their menu.  Everyone at our table left satisfied.  I personally had a bit of the beet salad and for my main course, I had the Pony Salad with smoked salmon.  The beets were deliciously sweet but a little on the smaller side so it'd be perfect before your main course.  The Pony Salad was a little more sizeable, less sweet as it was topped with blue cheese and bacon bits, and the smoked salmon was a fantastic touch.  Though I would love to try it with their sirloin next time.  Taking off a star because our waiter disappeared for a good long while after dropping off the dessert menu.  Granted we were a bigger group, so maybe he didn't want to disturb us, but really we just wanted to get our desserts.  The ambiance was great, it was a quiet night and the music was pleasant - not too loud but audible.  The layout was gorgeous and the home plate at the entrance was definitely very unique.  I wouldn't say it'd be date night-worthy (unless she's into sports), but great for a nice dinner out.

Saturday, March 26, the hubby and I got it in our heads to finally venture down and check out Little Miss Bbq to see if it rivaled our (former) favorite, Bobby Qs.  Their hours?  Tuesdays through Saturdays, 11-4.  Or until sold out.  That last bit scared me a little and as we drove over at 11.24AM, I joked that maybe they were already sold out.  We laughed it off.  They were nowhere close to being sold out when we got there, but as we sat in the car waiting to turn into the overcrowded parking lot, and as we stood in line, that little fear never left my mind.  And to be fair, we were waiting, for a while. Two and a half hours, to be exact.  I've never seen a line this long for food.  At points, it had crossed my mind to leave and get something else for lunch but we stood our ground, or rather, place in line, and waited.  The entire experience waiting in line was actually pleasant.  Or at least as pleasant as standing in line can be.  There was a guy out front, acting as a bouncer for anyone who tried to turn into the parking lot without waiting their turn.  There was another guy, directing the cars in the parking lot, offering a bottle of water to everyone who drove in.  Standing in line wasn't entirely terrible - there were misters that made it almost cold, there was shade, and there were all of the delicious smells.  As I waited, staring at the menu, I am guilty of changing my order several times before deciding on sticking to my original plan - half a pound of pulled pork and a sausage.  The hubby got a two-meat plate (brisket and pork ribs) and jalepeno cheese grits and a potato salad for his sides.  I shamelessly stole a little bit of everything on the hubby's plate and was a little upset with myself for not ordering the brisket, but everything was so good, I really couldn't be upset for long.  Was it worth the wait, hell yes.  Did it unseat Bobby Qs as my favorite barbecue place, without a doubt.  Would I do it again, unfortunately, because of the long wait, probably on occasion, or when I gather enough people to pre-order 5lbs worth of meat - apparently that's one of the ways you can cut down on your wait time.  Or strategically showing up an hour or so before it opens.  Also, kudos to the team working that Saturday before Easter (or any day really, seeing how every review seems to indicate that they're always busy).  They were quick and efficient and extremely friendly - even if you were a little grumpy after waiting in line, they'd definitely turn that frown upside down.

I hate to be a naysayer but I was not impressed.  Maybe I walked in with the wrong mindset, maybe I went on a slow day, but like I said, I wasn't impressed.  I was expecting a used bookstore, full of used books, but instead, all the books were pretty damn new,  with some claiming to be used.  From the reviews, I was expecting a quirky, fun place to hang out, but it was empty, dreary, and slow, with expensive, I daresay overpriced, little knick knacks.  I guess if I had walked in with a fat wallet, and expected a regular, run-of-the-mill bookstore trying to appeal to those who fancy themselves to be slightly obscure, it would have been great, but I guess it just wasn't my cup of tea.

After walking around Chandler Mall for a couple hours, I was pleasantly surprised to find this boba shop.  But that little joy that I felt soon disappeared when I placed my order.  First of all, the location is terrible.  There's a giant pillar in front of the store which causes all sorts of confusion.  People standing around looking at the menu, people waiting in line, and people waiting for their drink, all cluster around this pillar, making you wonder if the person you've been standing behind is even going to place an order.  The extremely lengthy menu doesn't help this at all as people, new or familiar with boba take forever to decipher this menu.  The girls working at the store don't offer any help when customers seem completely befuddled by the menu but seem like they themselves need help trying to figure out how to make the drinks we've ordered.  It's not uncommon to wait 10 minutes for your drink while they let one of the drinks sit behind the counter as the ice melts and they make every drink in every other order.  I'm trying to be forgiving because they're new and probably haven't fully trained all their staff but maybe train the newbies on weekdays, not the weekends?  I've tried to like this place given the convenient location, but I won't be stopping by again.

We've ordered delivery from here tons of times, and if it were up to me, I would've boycotted this place a long time ago (even though they've just opened).  And it's not that I hate pizza, I friggin' love pizza.  I'm happy with just about any pizza, except for the ones I've had from here.  To put things simply, I've had cheaper and much better overnight, cold pizza from Costco that tasted better.  At NYPD, the toppings on their pizzas are sparse, to say the least, the sauce is barely there, and don't get me started on the cheese.  It's disgustingly translucent when "fresh", and even more so when eaten a day later.  Plus, there's barely any of it so all I see is dough, and more dough.  And grease.  Not worth the money they ask, or any amount of money really.  This is college town guys, get on your game or you're gonna lose out to the five million other pizza joints in town.  Oh, and I've had better cookies from Keebler.

There will be a wait - 20-30 minutes, they'll text you when your table's ready.  It will be loud (bar-like atmosphere), if that matters to you.  Things will get messy.  But yes, it's so worth it.  I tried to snap a couple pictures but when everyone's too busy wolfing down the food and your hands, maybe forearms, are covered in trifecta sauce, things get a little difficult.  For the three of us, we got: 2lbs of shrimp, 1lb of mussels, 1lb of clams, 1lb of blue crab, and vegetables, all in trifecta sauce at a hot (level 3).  I loved the sauce - it definitely had a good kick to it but I might give level 5 a shot next time cause I mean who doesn't love a little challenge?  The veggies were okay, but next time I'll probably give it a skip and stick to the corn and potatoes instead.  Similarly for the mussels and clams, I mean there was a lot of shell.  I know, I didn't think this through, but probably half the bag was shell and I would've much rathered more meat.  Shrimp was a solid first choice for me, with crab coming in at a close second.  If you couldn't tell, I've got my next visit all planned out.  The boyfriend's mom doesn't care for seafood in general so she ordered 1/2lb of pulled pork.  We had a bite of some of her leftovers after devouring the seafood and it was pretty decent but I'm still a huge fan of seafood so...  To top it off, the boyfriend's dad was still raving about this place a week later, so I think we have a winner here.

I wish these burgers were bigger.  6 oz of meat is not enough. That said that was some delicious 6 oz of meat.  The patties are stuffed with deliciousness such as a reuben, which I had and was the burger of the month, or a BBQ MOS, which the boyfriend had.  You choose your own bun (brioche, whole wheat, or protein-style - I didn't care for my overly fluffy brioche bun), and choose your stuffing.  The reuben was exactly what you'd expect, erupting in deliciousness, but a little dry cause I had asked for my ourageous sauce on the side - you have been warned, don't make this mistake.  I traded half of my reuben for half of my boyfriend's BBQ MOS (I wonder how much he appreciates of me stealing his food...) and oh the gloriousness of the barbecue burger!  Juicy, amazing, and of course, the barbecue sauce!  I wolfed it down and stared at my hands, which were now, newly burger-free.  Oh the disappointment.   We shared a small side of outrageous fries, which is fries with a choice of one cheese and a stuffing.  And of course, outrageous sauce, which reminds me of the in-n-out sauce but with a little more tanginess to it.  So in a nutshell, deliciousness, EVERYWHERE.  But my little grievances would have to be: small burgers and pretty long wait times since they start your burger after you place the order and I think there was only one guy making burgers that night; I ended up waiting 25 minutes for my order, which is fine but it would've been good to know beforehand.  Anywho, definitely worth a shot and I'll be back!

Everybody.  I have a very important announcement to make.  They have cronuts.  [Exits stage]  But seriously, Rainbow does have cronuts and I'm told they're the only ones in Arizona who have it.  Please let me know if this isn't true cause I don't get out much and you have no idea how long I've been waiting for a cronut (it's not my fault that I follow a bunch of Instagram accounts that specialize in food porn and just when I forget what I'm missing out on, lo and behold, there's a picture of a cronut).  The cronuts looked and tasted very much like a donut on the outside but true to it's name, were layered, chewy, basically like a croissant on the inside.  Honestly, I don't know how I feel about it.  However, I would not dismiss the idea of having a couple more cronuts before coming to a decision.  :D  Besides the cronuts, I made the trip out specifically to get the maple bacon donuts.  Though Rainbow isn't the only place in the valley to have these, they are pretty darn cheap at $2 a piece.  They definitely hit the spot if you like bacon and maple long johns but were a little on the greasy side.  The red velvet and caramel cream were good too - I definitely enjoyed the red velvet crumble on top of the red velvet donut.  Service was great, really, really friendly and though I love that they're open godawfully early at 4AM, they do close at 7PM - so great for bringing in treats for the office, but less great for my late night donut cravings.  I was a little surprised when I stopped by on Sunday morning, that they didn't have more of the fancy donuts (cronuts, maple bacon, and the like) out but they were more than amply stocked on all the other donuts so a donut shortage is not what you should be worried about.  What you should be worried about is eating too many of these cause they're so addictive, and also the sugar high you're going to have after cause these donuts are pretty darn sweet.

Maybe my expectations were a little high and my brow a little furrowed after the ordeal of finding a parking spot on Mill, but I was not impressed. Starting with the good, they are very liberal with the gravy and toppings. And it was tasty. Now for the not so good. It was tasty until it was salty and the fries were soggy, which is basically after the first, maybe second, layer of fries. Let me explain, the gravy on its own was pretty salty and hits you a few bites in. So add greasy bacon bits, or cheese curds, or a couple slices of ham to that, and well, I really needed yet another cup of water. The main dishes themselves were priced at $7.99 for a small and $11.49 for a large. I don't know if that's considered reasonably priced for poutine, but I thought it was a little pricey. Not to be melodramatic but, adding insult to injury, if you want to make that a meal, it's $3.49 on top of that. That's not terrible, you say, but what's in this $3.49? Well, you get your choice of either a side of traditional poutine, regular fries, or a cole slaw. Does it come with a drink? For a discounted price of $1 on top of that $3.49, then yes, it'll come with a drink. I'm thinking maybe we should have walked out when we saw nobody was in the store while other restaurants had a lively crowd going? 2.5 stars, I'm rounding down.

PIZZAAAA!!!  MOD definitely does it right.  Do-it-yourself pizza (or tried and tested recipes, if you so wish) in three sizes, Mini (a little bigger than your open hand), Mod (11 inches, I think?), and Mega Mod (a double stacked Mod).  Throw anything and everything you want on it, or even do half and half (I recommend this) for a flat price of $4ish, $7ish, and $11ish for the three sizes, respectively.  The toppings are definitely varied and since I'm one of those weirdos who likes to throw the oddest things on my pizza, they definitely catered for that.  I had roasted brussel sprouts on my pizza, I rest my case.  They had sun dried tomatoes too, not so much a weird choice but a personal favorite of mine.  Definitely a lot of your regular toppings like sausages, pepperoni, chicken, chorizo, peppers, onions, and a couple of interesting ones like roasted garlic which I've never had on a pizza but will definitely have again - I'll promise to keep my distance so you don't smell my breath after!  I thought their pineapple looked a little too yellow but it might have just been the lighting.  And to top it off the staff were great!  Some of them were definitely new and still learning the ropes, but super, super friendly and always willing to give you suggestions and their advice so don't be afraid to ask!  I love the decor and the patio but it's still a little warm for that right now...  Unfortunately, there weren't too many seats indoors as they were mainly bigger tables and bars, so definitely good for big groups.  All in all, great place and check it out before more people find out about this goodness!

4:30PM - We placed our order online. Their site was easy to navigate but it really bugged me that they didn't put the actual size of the pizza online (ie. 7'' diameter, etc). Instead, there were suggested serving sizes. A small serves 2-3, it said. Well, I guess a small will do. Deep dish? Yes. The Malnati Chicago Classic, please. Uncut is better for take out, you say? Uncut it is, then. 6:15PM - Scheduled pick up.  I personally didn't pick up the pizza, so I can't speak for the ambience of the restaurant. However, the hubby did tell me the line for dining in was ree-di-cu-lous. At least an hour's wait, he guessed. The pick up line was a tad shorter but still fairly long, from what I hear.  Now fast forward to where I finally get to see the pizza in person. 30 minutes after the hubby picked it up. It wasn't as deep as I had expected and strangely, the tomato sauce didn't cover our entire pizza (Maybe the toppings shifted on the drive home?). But it was delicious nonetheless. We cut up the pizza ourselves and the cheese was fantastic. I'm no cheese connoisseur, but I eat enough pizzas to say this was some damn good mozzarella. Unlike your usual pizza, the cheese comes into direct contact with the crust, with the sausage and tomato sauce sitting above the cheese. The small was perfect for the two of us too. It was just filling enough and a medium probably would have put my stomach's capacity to the test. Did I mention that the crust had enough of a crisp but with some chewiness to remind you that this was indeed a deep dish and not a thin crust.  I most definitely will be back!
