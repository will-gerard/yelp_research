in my book this place deserves between  4 and 4.5 stars. it's all about the oven-baked bread. a limited menu but focuses on great sandwiches with quality ingredients.  can't go wrong with the classic tomato,mozz, and basil sandwich. delicious. only thing i wish was for some indoor tables

quaint and eclectic! a good place to go for a romantic evening. it feels like someone's home.  also it's byob and there's a small patio off to the side that's great when the weather permits.  beware tho - everything and i mean everything tastes really sweet

I spend too much of my waking hours at this mixed office/retail space and I pay $75/month for garage parking in a city where parking is usually free so naturally I can't be completely objective about this review.  Generally, it's Outdated, with too many empty suites, and expensive parking.  Take a look at the restaurants that somehow survive or haven't.... Houston's moved across the street, McCormick & Schmicks remains empty, and so does the space that housed a chain steakhouse that anchored one end.

Great little hideaway.  Been here for lunch and brunch and every time it's consistently good food and service.  A regular in the rotation...

I really wanted to like this place.  The people were friendly and the service was good, but the food was bland.  Pretty small and dark inside the bar area was practically noexistent.  Nevertheless, had to try the mojito.  So-so and have had better.  Also, the food looked and tasted like cafeteria food.  If you've ever eaten in Miami or S. Florida you will sorely be disappointed with the selections here.  I left questioning whether I went on an off-night.

If not one of the ugliest airports in the US certainly one of the most  depressing. In desperate need of some renovations, especially the outcast terminal 2 home to united & continental.  Driving around and out of the terminals can be a bit tricky and you may end up doing a few laps if you miss your exit.  Also, getting a rental car offsite can test your patience.  However, the short and long term parking lots are convenient and fairly inexpensive.  And if you are in need of 1,000+ new pieces of luggage or some free stuff swing by the baggage claim and help yourself.

Head-scratch for sure. I'm going to go out on a limb on this one and normally I don't bother writing a review for a place that already has a lot of opinions, BUT I have to say that I disagree with the vast majority. I just don't get why this place has a wait but it makes me think that I should quit my stupid corporate job and open up a sushi place and make a killing.    As one of the 50 (if that) asians in this state and having lived in DC, NYC, and SF this place is 1 notch above RA Sushi.  In other words, if you're from out of town DO NOT eat sushi while you're here. I'd rather make the drive out to LA.  What it's only 7 or 8 hours away.    But i guess if you pick up pre-packaged "sushi" from a grocery market like AJs this place might meet your expectation of a good sushi experience. Just remember to order the imitation krab meat and fish with the rice. Again, a warning to those that come from out of town and looking for good places to eat, hold off on sushi until you leave town. Would you eat Mexican food whiie visitng Osaka?  It's a sucker bet.

Its ok; 2 stars for food and 3 for service.  They make a good effort.  The fish is edible and if you live here it should suffice.  That's my opinion & of course subjective.  But giving it 5 stars is like asking an Italian for a recommendation and they give 5 stars to Olive Garden.

Stick with the fruit smoothies and add whatever health shots you are needing.  I've tried a few of the hot blends and am not a big fan.  The spicy chai tastes gritty and the green matcha has some bitter harshness to it.  Service is helpful, friendly, and quick.  Wish they had more of a seating area rather than the to-go setup.

Long-time dairy farmers this AZ family-owned operation specializes in goat's milk cheese like chevre and feta.  The feta has a pure quality and clean taste.  Picked up some at Petit Fromage and their cheeses are also available at most of the farmers markets. Also heard that they are hoping to sell their cheese at their farm in Buckeye later this year.

The 2nd time I went here to take out some out of town friends and they enjoyed it with a few minor mishaps.  Didn't see as much fusion on the menu as touted but it's probably a safer bet.  Some of the highlights were the roasted beet salad, the roasted chicken, and some sort of goat cheesecake.  A good place to go for a special occasion.

It's easy to forget that there may be decent places to eat up in N. Scottsdale.  Heading back into town from Carefree we decided to get dinner on the way and saw the sign in the strip mall.  I told my friend to just drop me off  to check out the place before she parked.  Not looking like a Pure or ultra trendy/gimmicky Japanese restaurant it caught my interest.  As I looked thru the window I saw an actual Japanese (not Korean - asians can tell the difference)  chef behind the bar.  Not really expecting much I suggested we give it a shot.  We sat at the bar and a friendly Japanese woman (later learn that she is the owner/chef's wife) greeted us with menus and pointed to the specials board.  While the fish on display seemed limited it didn't' look daunting.  We ordered some sashimi, a few specials, and 2 rolls.  The quality and freshness was surprisingly very good; pieces were cut with precision and the rice was just right.  Prices were a little high but i guess justifiable considering the rent and other operating costs to this small establishment.  It's too bad this place is kind of out of the way and currently only has dinner service.  But If you're into a more traditional style sushi experience with a simple approach you may want to check Toyama out.

4.5 stars or nearly perfect (-1/2 considering the hefty price tag). The facilities are top-notch, however, my massage left me a little unimpressed.  (Obviously, the actual treatment will vary from person to person.)  Also had a classic manicure on a separate visit.  very happy with the results.  For both the staff were nice but again service will vary.  The facilities included the usual steam room, jacuzzi, and sauna.  In addition, there was a waterfall pool and eucalyptus aromatherapy room,  Despite being busy the service was pleasant and helpful.  Also, the fitness center was well equipped and the outdoor rooftop pool area was cozy.

This place lives up to its reputation and I always leave satsified.  One of my favorite places to go for good subs, italian cured meats, and antipasto. While it's setup as a mini market/ deli, the market offerings are a little pricier than i've seen elsewhere.    Back to the subs tho - great crusty loaves, high quality meats, and made in true italian deli fashion. The also offer some traditional italian dishes if you're in the mood for a real meal.    While I usually just get a quick sub or am picking up some things to go, there are some tables to sit at if you choose.  Plus the people are pretty laid back and friendly.  Only complaint that I have is the traditional Euro-style reusable and communal towel in the restroom.  A little hard to shake considering how many people don't wash or don't wash properly.

Great coffee and even better service.   This little place is a nice and much-needed coffee shop in the area.  It's both a laid-back place to sit and chat but also quiet enough to get in some reading or work as well.   It's a rare treat to find a place that knows how to make real java drinks and especially my long black.

I'm upping this to a strong 4 stars.  Not cheap, but consistently Great coffee, expertly made espresso and americano drinks with the crema just right!  I don't know what happened but the chicks that work there are pleasant, effiicient, and a breath of fresh air.  I luv finding local businesses that I want to support and will be back on a more regular basis...

Charming, intimate, low-key, cozy, and solid food.   It feels like you are at a friend's home.    There should be more places like this... like in Scottsdale.  Yes, there are real people living there that are constantly driving elsewhere but bitching about the lack of places to go to in the near vicinity.  Maybe there's someone who will take a hint...

Chelsea's is an upscale neighborhood place and The food is good and it's one of my regular places.  They offer standard southwest American style fare like burgers, tacos, and they do a pretty good brunch.  My go-tos are:  - chicken nachos for the table to share  - burgers w/ the grilled poblano - fish or steak tacos - chilaquiles - Brussel sprout salad - keylime pie - sangria, mimosas & bloody Mary's  Other pluses- they have patio seating when the weather is mild.    Negatives include: limited parking but they have valet. Also It's loud so it's better for groups.

Go for the entertainment (people watching), the large bar area, the drinks, the bread basket, the SEAFOOD, the live music (albeit las vegas cheezy), and the BUTTER CAKE.  Standouts: SEAFOOD TOWER, Shrimp cocktail, Rib Eye, Garlic Mashed Potatoes, Mastros Mashed Potatoes, Gorgonzola Mac 'n Cheese, Green Beans and Almonds, and again the Butter Cake  Service is great except for the bar area but if it's not packed and if you can get seated sit at the bar area!  There's often live piano playing but if that's not your cup of tea the people watching is um entertaining at the least.

baker jeff and his team are true artisanal bakers.  ooh la la bread, challah, olive bread, you name it they've got it. the little retail store is great to stop by but has limited hours.  the selection is more varied (vs selection at aj's and whole foods) and often have something cooking and ready to come out of the oven.  the bread will cost you an arm and a leg but it's worth the splurge

I gotta give credit where credit is due:  for a corporate behometh sbux delivers.  They're not selling coffee but rather an experience - consistency, speed, friendly service, a good meeting spot, and free wifi.  This particular location doesn't have great inside seating areas, but the covered patio makes it a little more appealing to sit and enjoy.  Best of all the staff is always happy and will turn your frown upside down.

More like 3.5 stars this is their 2nd location with the 1st in old town scottsdale.  There isn't much to the decor but it's pretty clean and the food is consistent.  While they need more hired and seasoned help the staff is friendly and do what they can.  But the real reason to go there - the naan.  Hmmm....hmmmm... good.  Pillowy soft and freshly made in their tandoor oven.

This is a small mom-and-pop place across from the ASU West campus that caters to a mix of students, locals, and the small number of Asians in the Phoenix area.  I've only been there a couple of times during lunch for the popular Vietnamese subs (banh mi).  The combination pork roll is a baguette made up of thinly sliced pickled carrots, daikon, onions, cilantro, and meat or tofu. Popular bánh mì fillings include pork, paté, and chicken.   The subs were pretty good, but you can't complain as they are less than $4.  Also, the pho looked good and I will definitely return to try another time.

In my opinion Taggia deserves somewhere between 3 and 4 stars.  So I'm rounding up from 3.5 to 4 stars.  Both the food and service somehow fell a little short of expectations despite the impression that they put forth a lot of effort.    The menu is interesting with a mix of italian staples like pizzas and a diverse selection of seafood and pastas.  We started off with some standard antipasto including prosciutto, salumi, olives, cheese, and marcona almonds   All were pretty good but nothing to write home about.  However, the caponata/burrata spread over grilled bread was a nice way to start off a meal.  My favorite dish is the pan-seared sea scallops in brown butter with grapefruit and capers.  With specials like hand-made pastas we also tried the gnocchi with veal ragu and crab ravioli.  The veal ragu sauce was hearty and stoodout more than the gnocchi but the flavor of the dish seemed to still lack something.  It tasted something like your grandmother would make out in the countryside villa.  The sweet corn crab ravioli was also so-so and did not live up to expectations based upon the ingredients and description (ricotta cheese / sweet corn / wilted spinach / porcini butter). The Scottish salmon was good and I would order again even if cooked a little more than to my liking.        The dining room is fairly intimate and if you enjoy eating al fresco there is a great patio.  While Chef James and the service staff were very friendly and patient, there were inconsistencies throughout our experiences.  Food-wise everything seemed really fresh and the quality of the ingredients high, however, the tastes and presentations seemed more like dinner party food rather than fine dining.

Overall a nice spa but not the best in the area.  The fitness center really lacked as it had only low-end  and a limited selection of machines.  The spa had all of the usual treatment rooms including a steam room, sauna, and jacuzzi but considering the size of the overall facility these seemed fairly small and not equipped for large groups of people.  However, the standout and best feature was the heated mineral pool.    Staff were friendly and helpful, and my massage experience was great. Like most resort spas the treatment prices are high, and I probably would return only if they had some specials or promotions.

3.5-4 stars for a Japanese restaurant in the desert. (To be fair it's more for a non-sushi experience) I have to preface that i'm not a fan of asian food in the Valley as I've eaten at most of the highly touted places and been sorely disappointed.  Most of the time I find myself thinking that I      should have just  cooked at home.  If i've been stuck in the Valley for 6 months straight I'll start getting fidgety and irrationally purchase airplane tickets to satisfy my sushi craving masked as a visit with friends or family.  But in the meantime, I have Roka    This place needs some marketing magic as it doesn't attract the kinds of crowds that other Japanese restaurants in Scottsdale manage.  Main reasons are probably associated with its eclectic cuisine and odd location stuck between South and N. Scottsdale. I'm keeping my fingers crossed for this one as i'm worried that this place is living on life support.  It has to be one of the poorer-performing locations as overhead has to be expensive and this place always looks like it's barely breathing. but I guess they've managed to keep the corporate support. Even the head chef has changed in the short period since its opening.  But they seem to remain unfaltering.    Don't let the slow service deter you from checking this place out. They specialize in fish, meat and vegetables grilled over hot coals with a large seating area surrounding the large grills.  The menu is pretty diverse with sushi/sashimi prepared in the back kitchen (no traditional sushi bar) and cocktails are great with specialty sochu and other elixirs.  Also, the bar is nice with lounge seating nearby.  (No draft beer and not much wine as japanese food doesn't really go with wine) .  I've had mixed experiences with the service.  While all friendly, the competency-level and awareness of the servers are very inconsistent.   On occasion I've had to point out forgotten dishes and had difficulty getting a drink despite a nearly empty dining area.  The food is good but don't expect texan-sized portions.  Overall, i'm a supporter of this place as it meets the difficult combination of good food at reasonable prices.

Service experiences have been mixed:  the bartender was courteous, however, we have often been rushed.  When picking up a to-go order the hostess/cashier was clearly annoyed at my questions and rude in her responses.  For instance, why are the prices listed on the to-go menu different or less than what I am being charged?  Yes, I understand that the register is ringing them up that way and repeating that 2x doesn't make it ok.  Sometimes it's how you handle a situation that makes all the difference.    On top of the service issues, the pizzas always look and smell great upon arrival, but they have been disappointing the last couple of times.  Great selection of toppings and variety of pizzas, HOWEVER, it does you no good when you can't taste them with wet dough.  With the last couple of pies i've had here they've been soggy despite crispy crusts.    I also tried reheating the take-out pizzas in the oven to crisp them up but it was to no avail.  Very disappointing - it seems like they still haven't resolved their dough issues.

I've been to a several Valley resort spas and this one doesn't disappoint.    I guess rating and reviewing spas can be a bit tricky as not only treatments depend upon the staff but expectations and use of the facilities varies from person to person.  I'm a massage fan and love to use the steam, sauna, pool, and workout facilities.  Plush lounge areas and well-stocked shower and locker rooms are pluses.  The pool and pool area at this resort spa was the biggest that I've experienced.  Plenty of lounge chairs and a swimming area larger than average.  I also enjoyed 1 of the 2 outdoor showers.  Can't explain it but you'll know what i mean when you try it.  Made me want 2 get one for my home.  But i digress, the spa also has a decent cafe overlooking the pool area and the upstairs lounge area was very comfortable.  Need to go back soon!

How do you fail with dessert?  And with chocolate for that matter.  This place probably doesn't even make their own desserts.  When the server started by telling us about the fish special I decided that I would try that.  Of course they were 'out of it'.  So i opted for the tuna.  I figured ordered seared rare I'd be safe.  How bad could it be right?  Well, the tuna was ok (not the freshest) but the tapenade with it was just off.  Too overpowering It didnt go well with the tuna. Other dishes we tried were the campanelle which was better but nothing special that a decent home cook couldn't make.  The remodel was nice inside but wasn't a fan of the outside patio seating.  It was awkward and not comfortable.  I did like the addition of the community bar tables as the bar area is pretty small.  But this place will continue to be busy as it looks nice and it's in a great location.

Easy to moderate hiking overlooking the Troon golf courses with views of Four Peaks and most of the Valley. It's a little over 3 miles but it doesn't loop around.  Very well marked and maintained.  Watch out for snakes - I've seen a few of them and some of them quite big!

I've never eaten at Panda Express but my last visit made me think that this must be a similar dining experience.  I went to Thai House for the 2nd time in a few years and now I remember why I didn't go back after my first visit:  there was no reason for me to return.    Ordered their so-called house specialty:  charbroiled chicken and was expecting something more along the lines of a traditional Gai Yang or a marinated/spiced bbq chicken.  Instead what I got was a dry, dry, dry, and more dry pieces of thigh and leg pieces with a superficial coating of curry.  bleh.  On top of that the soup was cold and tasteless.  The Boston Market across the 101 or even a KFC would've probably had better chicken.  I guess I'll have to make the 45+ minute trip to Glendale or the Southeast Valley for better Thai food in the area...

Teeny tiny.  And I lived in a studio apartment in nyc for 5 yrs.  The facilities were minimal and didn't live up to the hype.  From the get go the experience didn't leave me wanting to return. The check-in desk was a little rude as they wouldn't let me check me in with a locker too early.  huh? Don't remember if they were all booked up or what excuse they told me.  However, I had a good facial- she was pleasant, experienced, and didn't go crazy with the extractions.

Pluses: 1.  Quaint bar/lounge 2.  Good cocktails and wine selection 3.  Gruyere Popovers 4.  Comfy seating 5.  Quality of food is excellent, especially the Branzino!  Short ribs were good but very heavy,  6.  Service - attentive without feeling hovered  Minuses 1.  Pricey - drinks and food, sides are extra and add up 2.  Noisy - gorgeous wood floors don't absorb the clatter and chatter  All in all I would recommend BLT as a good place to go for a special occasion.

Downtown and it's late but need a place for a bite and a drink?  Hanny's is a much needed welcome addition to the area.    While the food is not bad go for the atmosphere and drinks.   Atypical from this po-dunk town this is a good place to go solo or meet up with a group.  Also, checkout the $28K meat slicer at the bar (a work of art).   Overall:  Great bar.  Great cocktails.  Great service.

i've been meaning to come here for awhile now and glad that I did.  The place feels like someone's home:  warm, inviting, and relaxing.  In fact the waiting area was setup like someone's living area with couches, books, art, etc.  We started off with a few cocktails and they make them good and strong!  The okra and shrimp came with some interesting dipping sauces and had quite a kick.  I am not a big southern comfort food fan but Tuck Shop does bring a nice, light touch their dishes.  The mac n' cheese was good but I expected it to be divine, especially with lobster added to it.  The baby lettuce salad was refreshing on a hot, summer night in the desert.  But the pork t-bone was my favorite of what we tried as it was juicy, well-seasoned and perfectly cooked.  The servers were friendly and courteous and made the dining experience a great one.  Looking forward to going back1

Easy maybe but not fresh. This place reminds me of a gas/convenience store without the gas services part.    Most of the produce is packaged in plastic and found  much of it to be brown and old or on the verge of getting there . Why would they put tomatoes and other soft fleshed fruits and veggies in unbreathable plastic?  Try putting a plastic bag over your head and see how fresh you become after awhile.  Other misses: - tasteless prepared entrees.  even the premade soups aren't good. - meats and seafood are limited and look kinda iffy - an overabundance of the "f&e" brand vs. other brand offerings - organic  selection is practically nonexistent  Also, have visited the Frank LLoyd Wright location and had similar experiences. Ok as a business concept but with horrible execution they may want to make some changes.

i love you lamar whoever you are. Discovered these donuts after a co-worker brought a box of a dozen or so into the office.  I couldn't stop myself and am embarassed to admit i ate 3 and probably would've had another if they hadn't disappeared. think the coworkers thought i was eating for two as they laughed in disbelief that all 100lbs of me didn't even bother making excuses. didn't care as i was in heaven. homer simpson wouldve gone mad for these and i'm still kicking myself for not saving 1 for later. If i ate 2 or 3 of the krispy or dunkin i probably would've keeled over.  These donuts look like generic supermarket ones but after you bite into them you realize krispy kreme and dunkin are no match.  There's only 1 location in Arizona but if you love donuts you've got to try these.

Trails galore. Short, long, and longer. Plenty of hikers,  dog walking, and a good place to get in the desert mountain scenery.   Get away from the Camelback and Piestewa Peak crowds and experience true desert trails.  My favorite hiking area in the North/ NE Valley.

More like 4.4 stars but only because I think the facilities at the Fairmont in Scottsdale are better.  It's been awhile since I've been here but It was my favorite Valley resort spa until I visited the Fairmont. I think it was a good value as I hung out at one of their pools and the massage was little less-pricey.  The masseuse seemed well-trained and very professional in comparison to the one I met at the Fairmont.  Would definitely return!

Wish i could say more about this place but I showed up later than planned and couldn't take advantage of most of the facilities.  I did take a quick walk thru all of it and discovered pretty good workout facilities and a small cafe.    The first impression is a positive one as they take advantage of floor to ceiling windows to showcase the huge boulders surrounding the resort/spa.  The spa gives off a very zen-like vibe and is open and extremely relaxing.    I booked a body scrub/massage and it left me feeling great and refreshed.  Without hesitation i will definitely make the trip back up there.

Looking for some unique cheeses?  It's about time places like this pop up into this town.  PF shares a corner with D'licious Dishes and combines selective american artisan cheeses with some charcuterie.  The staff are friendly and helpful and you'll most likely find something that tickles your fancy.  Tried some interesting flavored american cheddars and picked up some local goat feta.      Along with your cheese pick up a baguette, some fruit spreads, and whatever else you can grab on your way and bon appetit!

This place is a yogi and yogini's delight.  Similar to Lucy stores but has selections for men. Not cheap but the selection and quality are great.  If you're looking for workout clothes or equipment they've probably got it. The staff are super helpful and they offer interesting activities such as yoga classes or even hiking.  Have been to a few stores across the US and have never had a bad experience. So glad it finally made it's way here.

Big fan. I drop by when i can.  Call me crazy but I like to actually taste the coffee.  As an avid coffee drinker and more of a purist i luv the turkish and drip style (makes me long for Blue Bottle).    Not much on atmosphere but quiet, cozy and a good place to get quality java drinks.  Barista 'DJ' knows how to make them right!

More fusion as expected in this part of town...  Overall Rating:  3.7 rounded up to a 4.0 Service:  Pleasant and gracious  - 4.45 Food:      Experiences have been mixed.  Generally a 3.0 - 3.7 Ambience:  4.0-4.5  With the same menu and a little bit morel formal feel, the experience at this location is pretty similar to the original/first one in South Scottsdale.  Not necessarily a destination drive but it's as Southeast Asian as you're gonna get in this area.

I've been there from it's early roots and been a big fan.  This place is a shining star in Old Town!    Hopefully they'll be able to continue with their standards post-transition but it's gonna be big shoes to fill...

Great coffee and fantastic service:  This neighborhood joint is a must when in the area.  It's quiet for study or a private conversation with plenty of comfortable seating.  They have a drive-thru window too if you don't have time to sit.  Plus, they always provide service with a smile!

3.75 stars:  The setup and attentive service are what makes this place standout especially in Old Town.  It has a good mix of bar, dining, and lounge areas and on many nites there's live music.  It's got a big patio as well.    The wine selection isn't very unique or broad but it's probably suffice for the majority of the people in the Phoenix area.  The Apps are ok as am not a fan of the bruschetta but the mozz/pesto plate is solid.  Have tried a few other dishes including the chicken and dumplings which were pretty good.  Overall, the food and drinks are ok but the service and ambience make this a place i commonly recommend to checkout.

First impression: So this is where my tax dollars went (besides the unnecessary repaving of numerous roads).  Um this place is nicer than my corporate office.  (Briefly entertained the thought of taking some pictures & anonymously sending them to my CEO) With all of the bells and whistles it's got a modern design and the latest technology.  It's got at least 2 dozen +/-24" HP TouchSmart Screens and all of the top accompaniments.  There's even spa-like music playing in the background.  What is this place really?    Way up in N. Scottsdale I was up here in the area and thought I'd quickly stop by to check out the place.  Read about the recent opening and must applaud the efforts on making it a green friendly facility. Considering the budget woes and pathetic quality of public education thought it was ironic that Scottsdale opened another library.   Scottsdale is applying to have the Appaloosa Library certified at the gold level in the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design program.  The 21,000-square-foot space is very contemporary; features natural lighting and a 600-square-foot array of photovoltaic panels that provide 2.5 percent of the building's peak energy demand. A monitor allows visitors to see how much energy from the sun is being generated for the library  Also, the library has a floating floor in the main room that makes it easier to reroute cabling to readapt the space and move bookshelves around.  Even the shelves feature energy-efficient LED lighting.  With the exception of the children's area a lot of the shelves look kinda empty (guessing not from checked out books). Not a far-out assumption considering the demographics and its average literacy-level.    Off to see if I can book a foot massage with the help desk...

While I prefer the taste of gelato or real ice cream sometimes the appeal of a sugar-substitute-loaded icy concoction and mix-ins call out to me.  A self-service shop with an abundance of fruit-flavored frozen yogurt I've got mixed feelings about this place.  Surprisingly i liked the taste of the yogurt here, but the quality control seems to be lacking.  3 or 4 (out of 10-12) of the machines were either dispensing runny/watery yogurt or stuck and not working.  Standard flavors were 'tart', vanilla, and chocolate but several were also labeled 'low fat' or apparently neither non-fat or low-fat.  It would be helpful if they clarified the differences.  In comparison to Yogurtology ($0.45/oz) or Mojo ($0.42/oz) this place is a better value ($0.35/oz) in my eyes but I worry as the location might not be able to attract the volume necessary to be economically viable.  Will definitely be back and hope this place does well as this area is in dire need of more decent places for food, coffee, and dessert. (On a side note: Sweet Republic is the only consistently good place in the area but it's really adding up on the expanding waistline...)

I've lived here for several years now and it took a friend from another part of town to tell me about this trail.  Checked it out and the views are great.   It's a hidden gem... for now.

Needed an afternoon sugar pickup and saw this place.  Pleasantly surprised with great tasting frozen yogurt at this self-serve shop.  Saw red velvet for those that crave the real thing.  Toppings are aplenty but wish they had some mochi like some of the other yogurt shops.    It's fairly new and there isn't much seating indoors but it's got a few tables outside next to the coffee shop.     Will definitely stop here again soon.

This is going to be simple and succint:  If you have ADHD then come here.  If you don't want to go to old town and feel old then come here.  Or if you don't want to go to North Scottsdale and see a lot of silver then come here.  It's a sports bar so stick with the basics:  team jersey, beer, and more beer

Went back and overall had a better experience:  better food and much better service.  Relieved to see some improvements and think that they will start to build some regular and return customers .  Will be back with others to experience good Thai and  hope to see this place continue to pick up business!

This place opened up about 2 months ago and checked it out last week for dinner.  First impressions:   - Enticing aroma of spices from the kitchen -  Clean but not much done in terms of atmosphere or decor:  a few key touches could spruce up the place.  Also, some music would help to set a relaxing setting -  Old and really old customer base -  Friendly service - Tandoori dishes were well prepared including Tikka Masala and the chutneys - Prices are high and naan is extra  Overall good place to go for Indian food in N. Scottsdale

Went back to Taberna for dinner and had a much better experience.  It was cold outside so instead of sitting outside on their patio (partially enclosed) we opted to sit in their cozy dining room.  It's well-decorated and well-designed with combination of booths and tables of different southwest styles.  Only thing missing was a nice mariachi band.  We started off with sangria, the 'aztec affection' cocktail, and draught beer - all pretty good.  I was looking forward to the house-made chips and salsas and they were fresh this time.  Before we knew it we had cleared the basked and we had to ask them not to bring back anymore - too dangerous...Also, remembered the standout tuna ceviche and the shrimp/halibut combination one as well.  Had to replace the shrimp with scallops but actually thought we lucked out as it meshed well with the jalepeno/citrus marinade.  The fried puffs that accompanied the ceviches were unique and helped to satisfy the texture of the dish.  We were off to a good start!  We all shared the fish special (salmon served fajita style), fish tacos, and some spicy jumbo or tiger shrimp (camarones) all served with black beans and rice and the handmade tortillas.  Despite being full we ordered the sopapillas with vanilla gelato to finish our meal.  Presentation-wise it was beautifully presented, however, didn't deliver on the taste front.  It didn't look like the dish as shown in the picture posted with the flan and tres leches as the dough was overly fried and there was  no pillow-like fluffiness to it at all.  The vanilla gelato was also bland and had no hint of vanilla, but we liked the hibiscus foam syrup as an accent.  Overall, the service was friendly, the food good, and the atmosphere enjoyable.

Yay!  It's not another Starbucks!  How come it took so long for a coffee shop to open in this retail center?  Good coffee, friendly service, and a few treats as well.  Wish it was a bit bigger with more seating but I'll take what I can get.

Good for an easy and leisurely business lunch or outing with the girls.  The market downstairs is great for takeout and a great selection of bakery treats.

Similar to the other locations it's a good place to get your fix to go.  It's hidden and there's a 2nd location/kiosk near the sushi place as well.

Great bar, great atmosphere, great service!  Citizen crafts classic old-school cocktails courtesy of Thomas and Rich.  ON top of that they have a few beers on draught, by the bottle and a pleasantly surprising wine selection.     Food-wise the menu is kinda geared towards comfort and southern style offerings including mac-n-cheese, scallops with bacon and corn grits, dungeness crab cakes with complementary slaw, pork-belly, etc  Again, overall good place to go for a casual and relaxing drink or two. Will be back for more...

Stumbled upon this place as I was in the new Scottsdale Quarter and desperately needed a manicure.  Walked into the place and it was immaculate as it recently opened.    Service was friendly and speedy.  Nails looked great and walked out feeling like a million bucks.

With all of the competition in the area I decided to return to this place despite it being a bit more expensive.  It's new, comfortable, and clean  - especially important when the risk of um unsightly germs and potential infection can be reduced.  Great service - friendly staff and most importantly left with a little pampering and the inside scoop on Vietnamese food in the Southeast Valley.

This family-run establishment has consistently served good  food:  handmade pastas, branzino, and other seafood specialties including true grilled baby octopus and fristo misto.  Great and unique beers including a diverse selection of arizona state, american, and european.  Try the canadian chambly - so smooth!  This place hasn't missed a beat since the old chef left - it's running on all cylinders.  One of my fail-safe go-to places that I highly recommend.

Stopped in for a light dinner and was pleasantly surprised.  There's an odd table sectioned off right at the entrance which also separates the small but cozy bar area from the main dining room.    Positives: 1.  Visually pleasant/ modern decor 2.  Friendly servers  3.  Decent wine selection with good California representation (finally) 4.  Scallops perfectly prepared 5.  Nice patio seating  Negatives: 1.  Bland ambience, need some life in this place 2.  Salmon overcooked (asked for med-rare)  Overall, a 3.75 star experience

I hate to do this but I can't say I'd recommend this place.  I've been there a couple of times and the experiences were similar.  The food is mediocre and a bit high on the pricing.  There is a lot of room for improvement on the service side:  inexperienced, not trained, and painstakenly disorganized and slow service albeit the staff were friendly.

What can I say except that I like my meat hot.  Ok, at least my sandwich meat should be toasty.    My office gets sandwiches a couple of times a week and Jersey Mike's is so much better than Subway and Jimmy Johns.  Better tasting bread, higher quality ingredients, and you get more than a paltry slice of meat.    This location in particular is efficient, the staff well-trained, and will definitely make it a regular in the rotation.

These guys always deliver and recommend this place for the food.  It's Not fancy and it's not a typical Scottsdale place where it's all about superficial looks and no substance.    Great ingredients, thoughtful preparation, and flawless service.    Come for the pork belly, stay for the blackberry pie!

This is not your typical mainstream, middle of the road Fox place.  Its creative spins on classics are a welcome addition to the Phoenix dining scene.  Enjoy the open kitchen and sit at the bar.  Favorites include: - hush puppies: (they're not kids wear) fried but not greasy  - sturgeon "bacon" & eggs - bouillabaisse - beignets with caramel whiskey dipping sauce:  watch out Cafe du Monde!

Pretty freakin' good burgers and the beer selection is awesome!  The setup, however, is not!   Order at the counter than go get a table and wait for the food to come out.  1... by 1.... by 1 more... and by the time the other person is done eating their food.... maybe you'll have yours in front of you.  Apparently this seems to be an issue with others and not sure it really makes good business sense.

Trying to find a great hairstylist is like searching for the perfect pair of jeans.  There are okay stylists (and jeans) and then there is Tyler.  He's talented with scissors and knows what he's doing!  I admire his passion for his work and making his clients happy.

So disappointing-  After two visits both times the chicken and shrimp were terrible.  Shrimp were overcooked and chewy while the chicken was overdone as well. The veggies and rice are fine as so are the sauces.    Friendly quick service but the quality isn't there.

Capital Grille always hosts great events and I've had a few other special occasions that were positive experiences as well.    Great food pairings with the wines and liked how informative they were; the chef came out to talk and describe the dishes and the sommelier helped explain the pairings.     All of the staff were courteous and professional and would definitely keep it on my list of great venues.
