We took two pies home: pumpkin and chocolate cream. Both very yummy, excellent crust and filling. I have not eaten the food here but looking forward to giving it a shot. Will definitely be coming back for pies for the holidays. Pricy but homemade. You get what you pay for. Service was mediocre, one super nice foreign lady and one not so nice girl who looked annoyed. Sloppy attire. 5 stars for pies though!!

I enjoyed the chopped salad very much. We got the shrimp appetizer and it was spicy but very good. The service is precise and not pushy or rushed. The music is nice, the faculties are clean and overall the restaurant feels like it's new.  I would like to go here for dinner and see what the crowd is like. I will definitely be back.

I like this place for their margaritas, chicken tacos and the pollo fundido. Sometimes the chicken in the pollo fundido is dry :( hit or miss. The tacos are yum and the outdoor patio is beautiful. Sometime there is live music which makes it special. I find the main dining room kinda cold. The service is usually pretty good - sometimes slow. Overall, I really enjoy coming here, it's close and the food is usually pretty good.

Incredible food and tea. I love their shepherds pie and any of their soups. Their spa tea is so comforting pr if you like black teas, get the black current - yum! They have delicious scones with amazing cream and jam. I just love this place. The decor makes you feel like you are in a quaint tea shop in England and if it raining out, you want to stay on this place for hours. The gals that serve you are always kind and allow you to take your time. This is a very special place to me and my mom. Enjoy!

Breakfast was mediocre at best. Bland. Not cozy. We live close and never go here so it's just not our fav breakfast place. Service was ok.

The server was kinda silly but overall he was kind. The busboy was on top of it and they remembered it was our anniversary so that was very special. I'm sad to say that our food was mediocre. I ordered the gnocchi and my husband orders the salmon. The gnocchi was really mushy and oily. The salmon was bland. The cauliflower app was really yummy. I won't be coming back. Our bill was over $100 and I just didn't feel it was worth it.

I love this place. My daughter had to get glasses when she was 3 and being someone who never had to wear glasses herself, it felt very foreign to be responsible for glasses and what it all entailed. I absolutely love everyone at north valley eye care. The doctors do a great job with kids. It's extraordinary!!! They have top notch choices for kids, and incredible insurance plans for scratched lenses and broken frames. I tried to go to a cheaper place and it was a waste of money and time. I won't go anywhere else but here and recommends them to all my mama friends. So grateful they are close too!!

I really love this place. I think the food is fantastic and the service is excellent. The ambiance is cowboy meets elegance and the food is thoughtful and extremely tasty. I would recommend this place to anyone! I love their spin on chips and salsa, and I recommend their fish and steak. Can't go wrong!

I got the VIP wash after getting bamboozled into an interior clean. I didn't have time to stay for the details so I just got the VIP wash. When I return to my vehicle, it smells like someone smoked a cigarette in my vehicle and never rolled down the window. So gross!!!!! Seriously......I am so disappointed with his place time and time again however, they have a market for car washing. If someone could just open up a new car wash in this area, I would go. And by the looks of these reviews,  many others would too.

This place is great. Fast service, good food, hot coffee. The bagel breakfast sandwiches never disappoint. They have a good combo deal during the week with drink. I like that is a deli too so you can get meat, breads and cream cheese to go if you need it. The place is usually packed and they are very quick to roll orders out.

I have been looking for a new ENT Doctor closer to home. I decided to give Valley ENT a shot and had the pleasant opportunity to meet Dr. Bailey. He was professional, kind, considerate, and helpful. I enjoyed talking to him as he seemed to really listen and care. He took one look into my nose and knew what was wrong and had multiple suggestions based on my comfort. We collectively put a plan together to get me on the mend. It was the best experience I have ever had with a doctor. Highly recommend!

Waiting.....So. Much. Waiting. Don't bring kids here and don't go if you have an hour to eat. You need 2 hours here. Service is so painstaking s-l-o-w. We have been here twice on Sunday evening - around 8pm. Never seen a manager or even an essence of a manager. It's weird. You walk in and the hostess will say - there will be a 20 minute wait and there are tables open?? I think this place is either under staffed or the manager is not lighting a fire under anyone's butts to get things moving. I knew the food would be great because Oregano's food is always great. WE WILL NOT BE BACK UNTIL WE HEAR SERVICE HAS IMPROVED. Move people! Stop standing around! The atmosphere will be more lively too, like the feisty,quick,fun Oregano's that I'm used to!

What a great find. The food was served by a wonderful staff and we even had a great conversation with the owners. Their passion for great food, awesome beer and a fun time shows in their overall quality and superior hospitality. Let's talk first about the food. My friend and I both got the chefs special - a 6oz sirloin with veggies and a twice baked potato. I hope they make this a regular item on the menu because holy COW...this dish was amazing. All seasonings were on point and entire meal was cooked to perfection. We had a couple fellows at our table order Jacks sliders which were gone in minutes, no complaints there at all! One ballsy gent ordered a pastrami burger and said it was incredible. He was so happy! Next lets talk about the drink selection. Wow - so many beers! So many cold and frothy options! And happy hour looks incredible (note to self) :)  the service: everyone was attentive, accurate and kind. Can't get better than that! Our water glasses were always full and we had plenty of options to order more beer. Excellent service! As far as the atmosphere: games! Awesome music and tv's everywhere. It's a perfect place for all your senses. I would say, this bar sets the bar high. Definitely going back and bringing more friends...you can camp out here for day drinking on football Sunday or a little happy hour wats after work. Love this place! Jacks Place!
