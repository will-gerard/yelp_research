11:30 tee time, finally hit the first tee at 12:15.  Followed with almost a six hour round of golf.   Not a marshal in site to speed up play.  Our group waited almost half an hour just to tee off on a par three.  I've been to this course quite a few times over the past couple of years.  It is a nice layout and usually in good shape, however after today, never again.  Having a good round of golf is all about establishing a rhythm.  You will never establish that here.

Walked in and ordered lunch; falafel pita and a side of rice. Would hope it would only take 10 min (since I was the only one there), but it took 20 min (minus half a star). The salad accompanying the pita was meh.. Iceberg lettuce, a couple slices of tomato, a handful of parsley and a vinaigrette. First off, let's get some real lettuce on a salad, f*** this iceberg crap. And how about some veggies? (minus half a star).  Now the good. The falafel pita was damn good! Crisp on the outside, fluffy on the inside and tons of flavor. The hummus on top completed it. All that served in a pita that was thinner and had a little bit of a crisp to it was tasty. The rice was delicious as well; simple white rice with good seasoning and cooked perfectly.   Overall I will be going back, though I may call ahead to minimize the wait.

My hidden sushi gem :)  I've been recommending this place for years and they have never been disappointed.    Robert is great!  Behind the sushi bar, he welcomes everyone as they should be, a guest in his home.  If you take the time to introduce yourself, he will remember you on your subsequent visits.  The best experiences we have ever had at Dozo is to leave our dining experience in his hands.  Often times we are able to try new things we would not have previously thought of.  Give yourself some time here, plates come out as they are prepared as Robert and crew put a lot of love into each dish that is prepared.  This is what a sushi dining experience is about!  Dozo is a must!!

This place blows. Robots with no personality dealing cards,  don't even try to make it fun for you while you're burning through cash. But hey, at least you can drink for fr.... er or chea...er...... $7 for a beer or well drinks?!?!?! Now that's some b*lllsh#t. Meh, go f*** yourself Talking Stick. There's a reason why the casinos in AZ will never be as fun as the places in Vegas.

Went here for lunch with my better half this week.  Had been wanting to try it after seeing some great Yelp reviews and personally been craving some good southern BBQ for quite some time.    I ordered the combo #2 plate because it had a little of everything, and that was what I was craving.  I elected for the links on the sandwich, side of ribs, side brisket and sifde of mash with gravy.  The girl ordered pulled pork sandwich with fries and a side of mac n cheese.  The hot links were tasty, nice flavor in the front and a slow heat that really came through on the finish.  The meat on the ribs fell off the bone and had a great sweetness to them.  The brisket....fuggedaboutit!!  My only complaint is I wish I had orderd more of this!!  It literally melted in my mouth, absolutely amazing flavor.    The mash was great, but the gravy really did it justice.  Heather used of it on her fries so I wish I had asked for more because I ran out for my potatoes.   The pulled pork was good, just a wee bit dry and the fries, were, well, fries.  I prefer fries to be extra crispy on the outside, not so potato-ee (making up words here) on the inside.  The mac n cheese was pretty good, had a subtle sweetness to it that was very enjoyable.  Service was good, very friendly.
