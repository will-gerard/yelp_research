I love Oregano's and my hubby and I go to various locations throughout the valley. Every time we order takeout from this location we have nothing but problems and bad service. Today: our order took 45 minutes longer than promised. After finally asking the young lady to check again she laughed and said "oh it's been ready a while now". The meatballs in our order were so badly burned they tasted like feet so we had to throw those out.  Also, while waiting a lady came in to pick up pizza and the toppings were wrong so it had to be redone. My husband told the manager he would buy the mistake pizza (it sounded delicious to him) so it wouldn't go to waste. The manager gave him a super dirty look and said "why would you do that?"...okay never mind...

Really great service and clean facilities! They made the experience comfortable and were very professional. They gave me options for pricing and let me choose what was right for my needs. As a bonus, the gentlemen always opened all doors for me! Friendly, courteous, and fast. Will be back!

I took my puppy to get spayed and vaccinated. I was so impressed by the personal attention we got. The entire staff was friendly, caring, and knowledgable.    A few days after her surgery penny got ill from an unrelated issue. I called Dr. Keller and he told me to bring her in. He examined her at no cost and gave me some options. Wow! What caring service!!   True animal lovers work here and I only wish they were a full service animal hospital so I could take all my pets there for everything else!

I don't know where all this money talk is coming from...this studio is way more affordable to dance at let alone compete with than any other studio I know of. Great teachers and owners who truly care about our children! It is a great place to be! Get in while you can!!

This restaurant has everything! Great food, great service, atmosphere, location, etc. The roasted cauliflower is so delicious and one of my favorite dishes to order.  Everything is made from scratch and absolutely incredible. Price is on the lower side so we always add dessert and coffee! Hands down the best hot latte on this side of the country. Great conversations with the staff who are so friendly and welcoming. Love love love!!!
