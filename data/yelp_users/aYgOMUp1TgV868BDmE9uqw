Waw. That's all you can really say about the quality of food at blue hound. The restaurant certainly lives up to its name ... When you get your food you will feel blue... And it will look more for a hound than a human. My food had no flavor and literally came out hotter than the a Kim Kardashian Instagram selfie... She actually might have been the head chef because the meal totally lacked creativity and taste.

David is a real gentleman. It's not everyday that you find a small business owner who is customer centric like him. He addressed all our needs and went above and beyond to make sure we understood what chemicals were being applied to our house and how they interact to solve our pest problems. He also made sure I understood how and where to place extra pest traps to maximize the effectiveness of his service. Will be calling him for all future needs.
