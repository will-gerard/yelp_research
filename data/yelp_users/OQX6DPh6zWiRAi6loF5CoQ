My husband had out-patient surgery here today. It was very clean and organised. Everyone was very nice to us. I would give them 5 stars if they hadn't been running 2 & 1/2 hours behind - but I know they are very busy. I thought it was so nice that they had free valet service for surgery patients. They also had a nice cafeteria with lots of choices and fair prices.

I've been going to Warner Family Practice since 1990. It ran much more efficiently when Dr Turner was the primary doctor and the practice was much, much smaller. Now I see Mike Hudson and I think he's great. He has a great bedside manner. I think there front office does not run as efficient as they could. Sometimes I have to remind the front desk people I checked in 30 minutes ago & then finally someone gets things going. It's nice they have an on site lab but it  use to only take a few hours to have all the testing done, now it takes all day long!!! Otherwise they have a great staff to choose from and overall do a good job at taking care of you. I would definitely recommend Warner Family Practice.

This is my go to store. Everyone is very friendly and helpful. I can find most everything I need at Albertsons. The store is very clean and organized too. If you pay attention to there sales you can get lots of good buys. So glad this store is just a mile from my house.

Skyler has been going to Pete and Mac's for several years now. Usually one or two days a week to play in the small dog day care group. She loves it and everyone is always so good to her. She has also stayed for several days in boarding when we go on trips. We have her play in day care everyday then. She always has fun and comes home exhausted. She also has her hair done there and always looks so pretty. Really I'd say Pete and Mac's is her 2nd home. I would definitely recommend Pete and Mac's:)

Always busy here...but fast service, clean place and friendly staff. Great for a quick lunch while running errands.  The drive in line is always busy too...but they do a good job of moving everyone through.

Products are fine just don't be in a hurry.  The drive thru line will take forever to get through so just don't be in a hurry. Also the you can tell the people who work there are really under stress. Maybe it's just poor management or they are more busy than they look.

Thanks so much for coming out Monday and getting rid of our bees. We called the water department and they replaced the water valve with a new one that seals. So hopefully the bees won't be able to get to the honeycomb anymore and won't come back:)  Thanks again.

The hamburgers and shakes are fresh and very good and the people that work here all seem to be helpful and nice.  I'd give them 5 stars but it's the drive to get into here on a busy Saturday that is awful. Someone did not think that through...  Thank goodness they send an order taker out to take your order ahead of time.

This is a great park to walk through anytime. There are several different paths to take so you won't get bored. If you go early in the morning you often will see little rabbits running through the bushes. Also you'll see lots of other little varmints. We take our little dog with us - she love's to sniff all the new smells. We bring our litter bag and there are trash cans placed around for disposal of waste. They also have toilets in case you need to tinkle.  We see several people fishing and there are covered tables to have a picnic.  Nice breeze off the lakes.  I just think it is an all around really neat park. They also have information posted about the plants and stuff. Just a lot of fun:)

I've had to take my car in 2 times within a couple of months because of air conditioner problems. It wasn't blowing very cool air. My service representative,  Jacob was very helpful and professional. They had to keep my car a few days but provided me with a loner car so I was just fine.  They did preform some factory matainance and replaced a part on the a/c unit and recharged it with freon. It worked great for a while.  Then started not blowing as cool of air again. I called, they got me in right away and they could not find a leak but did put some dye in so that if it happens again they hopefully will find it - and they recharged the a/c with freon again and did some other factory matainance again. So far so good.

Been going here for many years. They are very personable and have good doctors. They also have an excellent grooming staff. Just keeps getting more expensive. No wonder so many people can't afford to have an animal:(

Everyone is so professional and friendly at La Vida. I go two or three times a month.  I particularly like Chella. But I have gone to others that are also very good. I would recommend them to help you.

Very busy at this time of year. Had to wait 35 minutes for my eye exam but Dr. Farr is a really neat doctor and very good at answering all your questions about your eyes or contacts or glasses. I've been coming here for years. I just should remember not to make an appointment in December!!!

Yogurt is fine but the staff are not consistent with purchase of products.  3 months of going there & staff know they offer a 25% discount when you purchase the extra large cup. However, other evening went in got my extra large cup, filled it up & the owners son told me they have never offered 25% off!! He was very rude.  I was not there to argue - so I just walked out. So frustrating cause the little store is so close to home. Just wish they'd get there act together:(

I've been going to Tiana's Nail Salon for about 6 months now. Thought I'd try them because they are close to my home. Everyone is very friendly and I've had different nail technitions for my mani & pedi....all have done a great job. I would reccomend them.

Quick response to my phone call. Great communication by phone and text. Was able to do the work we needed done within a couple of days of my asking and they did a great job at trimming and clean up for a reasonable price. Thanks very much. I will call you all again.
