Service A+. Food B-. There was beautiful seating outside next to the herb garden. I had the ribeye topped with Dungeness Crab on a bed of mushrooms and bacon. The steak was ok however; the mushrooms were amazing. My wife had the sea bass which was less than stellar. I gave the overall rating four stars, but the food honestly was about three stars.

I'm am use to a certain level of untidiness at Waffle Houses in general, but this morning was by far a clear indication I need to stop eating here. There were a number of flies as well as a couple of roaches in clear sight. One roach was even at the register as the serve packaged my food and collected my money. Please do better Waffle House!!!

I was honestly blown away with the many flavors I experienced  here. First there was the freshly baked bread and pesto dipping sauce. By far the most flavorful pesto dipping sauce I've ever tasted. The bread melts in your mouth and the garlic pesto pairing is to die for. Then there was the spicy shrimp risotto and bone in ribeye that my wife and I shared. I'll start with the risotto. Flavor A+ however the consistency of the risotto was B-. It was a tad bit runny, but I still would highly recommend it as it was still a stellar dish. The ribeye, on the other hand, A++. I ordered it medium and it was cooked to perfection. Honestly I would recommend having the risotto as a side option. Lastly, the service was great and the drinks were great. Over all experience excellent.

Lola's was featured on Diners, Dive-in, and Dives therefore it was a no brainier to stop in. The place is whether small, so the wait was long. I asked the hostess could my party order drinks while waiting. She, rudely uttered, "one of you can go to the bar". No worries, I thought, as she appeared to be busy with nothing. The night hit a downward spiral from then on. We were offered seats from the hostess, but never seated three times. Once we were seated the bad service continued with our server who never brought anything back we requested. To top it all off, we were chased down in the parking lot asking if we paid out bill. Embarrassing!!!! Needless to say, I will never be eating there again. The food was sub par, the portion sides were unacceptable, and the price didn't match our return. I wish I could offer negative stars!!

I seriously did not know this was a smaller version of Mrs. Buttersfileds. The wait time was super long and the dining area was super tight. Food is just as good as the mother restaurant. I recommend Butters if you are ever in the area.

I was super excited to see there was a breakfast spot near me that served grits. The atmosphere and service was great up until the moment I pulled someone's hair from my tooth. I was instantly mortified and expressed my concern to who appeared as a female manager. After I shared my discontent regarding the hair fiasco she begin to laugh and tell me her cooks wear hair nets. Lets just say I will never return to this establishment.

We finally stop to try out this joint. Overall, very imprssed.  I would describe BurgerFi as a better five guys. Less greases and cleaner facility. The fresh squeezed lemonade, strawberry lemonade, and sweet tea were great. A must try.

I love this place!!! I ordered the Dungeness Crab and my wife had the Snow crabs. Food was great! The Cajun Fries were also boom. I think the Angry Crab is a great addition to Mesa, AZ. My only suggestion is to be careful, the level of spice can easily be underestimated. Go as often as possible, I really don't wanna see this place close.
