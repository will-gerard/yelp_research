Very unimpressed with this salon. I got a basic trim and it cost $75. I felt like this was a bit over priced for what I got, but nonetheless I went back a second time and the price was increased to $100. So beware prices apparently they just go up whenever they feel like it. Additionally, making an appointment was a pain as no call was ever returned after leaving a message at the salon. Overall, just not worth the price and hassle.

Great sized personal pizzas and quality ingredients. My favorite is that you can go gluten free for only $1!

Great place to come eat with friends. Love that they have $5 glasses of wine.

This is easily my favorite place. Really tasty food and the churro ice cream is to die for.
