Was told how low all my levels were in after checking, they're all fine. This place tries to sell you more stuff than you need, even if they have to lie to do it.

If you drive your car like me, till it falls apart.  Firestone is the place.  They will match any deal.   Plus you can get a life time wheel alignment for $ 169.00.  If you get your tires aligned least once a year and they wear funny they replace for free no questions asked.     Down side is the neighborhood.
