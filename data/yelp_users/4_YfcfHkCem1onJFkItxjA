$8 for a well vodka/tonic at Majerle's? Are you serious?   I haven't paid that much for a well drink except for fancy resorts and pricey bars in LA or NYC.  That drink and a tall Blue Moon last night came out to a ludicrous $16 before tip. Perhaps this is special highway robbery pricing for unsuspecting NBA All Star visitors?!  TVs are awkwardly placed, but the exposed brick lends a time-worn atmosphere to this cozy sports bar.  $16 just isn't worth it though. Too many other bars in the vicinity to waste your time.

I don't make it to Grand all that often, so when I see the Paisley Violin it's usually on a First Friday when it's packed like a sardine can with cafe-goers mixing, mingling and watching a live band perform on stage.  Imagine my surprise on a recent Friday (not a First Friday) night for a show when there were only 5 or so people there.  Once the show wrapped up, it was back to kick ass deep 80s cuts (think Thompson Twins song from Sixteen Candles and Joe Jackson) from RadioNigel.com playing in the background.  The ambiance is a truly metro cafe - something many local coffeehouses are lacking. The feel inside is very bohemian chic with its moody lighting and eclectic look.  Random bric-a-brac abounds here - everything from fish tanks to a bird cage, for sale I think. It's more of a European caf / art gallery / live music venue than a coffeehouse.  Bathrooms are kind of rough around the edges - if you can hold it, you're better off.  They serve a variety of coffees and tea and light fare like sandwiches, salads - lots of veggie options, btw.  I had the mandarin spiced ice tea with a Venice Violin panini with dried Italian salami, provolone, veggies, pepperocini, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and Dijon mustard on a sourdough baguette. Nothing to write home about, but the food was pretty good.    I really dug the vibe at Paisley Violin, I'll be back for sure - just not on a First Friday.

I haven't been to many convention facilities, but the Phoenix Convention Center (formerly the Phoenix Civic Plaza, which was a dumb name, btw) really shines.   Compared to the LA Convention Center, this place is outstanding.  Over the past few weeks I have been to events, meetings and banquets in the South Ballroom and West Hall.  The West Hall looks clean, modern, and is impressive with a gigantic atrium entrance on 2nd St. and seemingly endless escalators up to the third floor.    Audio visual equipment here is top-notch and they spare no expense with the A/C - holy crap it was FREEZING!  Signage for the restrooms could be more helpful as I found myself guessing where the loo was each time.  I'm not sure who does the catering here, but I found the food to be above average, but not outstanding.  Think ordinary salads (chicken cobb and a southwestern caesar), your typical rubber chicken banquet meals, a breakfast buffet of eggs, bacon, Starbucks coffee etc.   For dessert we had some kind of cheesecake turnover sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar - yum.   If you go in the near future - definitely check out the ongoing construction. The top floor of the West Hall boasts an impressive view of the North and East expansions where you can see all the cranes and construction going on and more detail than you can imagine.

The pulled pork here is fantastic....and the BBQ sauce, I don't know what they do it, but it's finger lickin good!  They add just enough spice, sweet and kick to make it near-perfect.  You can't go wrong with a BBQ sandwich here.  There fries here are good and potato-ey - and their potato salad comes with a nice mayo whip celery and big chunks or potato.  Nice!   Don't expect much here in terms of decor - with the counter service and former Taco Bell digs.

Amazing food, great presentation and sleek space - with NO WAIT on a Saturday night!  Huh?  Yes, you read that right.  After taking in the Body Worlds exhibit (What else does someone do after seeing dead bodies?  Have dinner of course!) at the AZ Science Center we headed to Pizzeria Bianco and decided that we really didn't want to wait 3.5 hours (Phoenix's equivalent of Bridge and Tunnel were at PB in full effect) for food, especially when there are so many great restaurants within 1 mile.  So off to Cheuvront it was, and what a great dinner it was.  Atmosphere - 5 stars Food - 4.75 stars Service - 3.75 stars Overall - 4.5 stars  This is my third visit over the past few years, and each time it has been on a weekend night with a surprisingly sparse crowd.  I'm not sure why this is.  I've never heard anything bad about this place, so I suspect AZ State Senator Cheuvront's restaurant must be suffering from light rail construction.  Their loss should be your gain, as diners are rewarded with light crowds and superb food and wine.  Even one of my dining guests visiting from New York City was impressed.  The sexy modern space on the first floor of the Artisan Lofts sets that perfect urban tone that the menu and locale indicate.  We sat at a table towards the back close to the loungey sofa area and curtained bar tables.  Cool touch.  We started out with a nice bottle of sauvignon blanc chilled in a fancy container and noshed on a French charcuterie plate of a pate mousse, cornichons (I have a weakness for salty gherkins), two cheeses, marinated artichokes, asparagus, kalamata olives, smooth spicy mustard and a crusty artisanal sourdough baguette.  What a great way to start a dinner, eh?  Our main entrees continued the pace and didn't disappoint.  I ordered the prosciutto wrapped grilled shrimp and macaroni and cheese.  Those thangs weren't shrimp.  These MOFOS were GIANT tiger prawns, and they were presented on a bed of mango avocado salsa drizzled with a balsamic reduction.  HEAVEN.  The macaroni was impressive as well - and cooked with three fancy cheeses: Quebec cheddar, comte and a dry jack cheese.   Bonnie shared some of her ahi tuna salad nicoise - and that tuna was seared and seasoned perfectly, and surprisingly fresh.  Additionally I had a taste of the peppercorn filet and was pleased with the marinated tender taste of the meat.    Price for 3 people (apps, entrees and $40 bottle of wine) - $115.  Average entree - $16.  Not bad, methinks.  My only complaint would be the service.  It was very good for the most part, but started to falter toward the end as our server's attentiveness (which was impressive most of the evening) left us with finished dinner plates on our table for about 15 minutes.  In his defense though, he gave us a very warm and classy (classy with a 'C') welcome and spoke very knowledgeably about the menu and wine when we had questions. Additionally, the hostess and other servers are super friendly and congenial.   I'm eager for my next visit so I can try some of their martinis and buy cheeses from their retail section, but I would be just as happy enjoying a glass of wine there and soaking the place up.

Any sandwich wrap special named the Paris Stilton gets extra points in my book.  It was a tough decision between the partygirl/jailbird-inspired wrap or, the Tipper and AlbaGore Tuna, the Ken and Barbie Que, and the Very Brady Clubster. Beyond the cutesie named sammies, is some decent (and healthy) lunch grub.  The menu is basically just wraps, salads and rice bowls.  The digs are real cute in a boho-chic, let's-open-a-restaurant-in-an-old-house sort of way.  The wrap itself (Very Brady Clubster) was WAY better than I expected.  Typical club ingredients with sun-dried tomato mayo and cornbread stuffing (almost polenta like) that really OUTDID itself.  Highly recommend.  The bowtie farfalle pasta salad was a bit oily for my liking, but they also have chips and salsa and fruit salad as alternatives.  Tons of veggie options here, as the owner here also owns Green in Scottsdale.  Tofu can be substituted on anything here.  It can get crazy packed around lunchtime with downtown suits on weekdays so def. check out on Saturday if you can.  The line was about 10 peeps deep at Noon and parking was a bit scarce.  Damn Gina.

4.5 stars, and worth the drive to the hood!  The billboards of the giant super 3-lb. burrito finally cast a spell on me, and I took the plunge.  La Tolteca is not quite as full service as Ranch Market, but it's somewhat of a smaller version where you'll find a counter-service deli, panaderia, carniceria, jugeria, and a mini-market here.  Even better is their cooking tools section (where you can buy huge tamale steamers, and mortar and pestles for making chile) and the catering menu which starts at $5 per person.  Holy crap.  What a steal.    Upon entrance you'll see the deep pit outside where some man is grilling all the carne you'll find served inside.  As you step inside you'll see some brisk business - I found all sorts of types and ethnicities here - a young couple on a date, some girls gabbing over lunch and others ordering food and pastries to go.  The food here ROCKS.   It's very authentic, cooked by commadres and tias just like back home.   The Grandma quotient on the beans and rice was very high -- always a standard assessment in my quest for good Mexican food.  They have every imaginable burrito type here and they're huge and cheap - at $4.  I always opt for the veggie (rice, beans, cheese and guacamole) burrito and am always impressed - the best part being the freshly made tortillas.  I even bought some on my way out to take home.  The tacos are a good choice too.  The combo plates start at $5.  The carne asada (a little overcooked) was pretty good and delicious in a flavorful marinade, and the shrimp taco was really good - a much better choice I would add.  Paired with some tamarind, strawberry agua fresca or horchata and you'll be in heaven.  I find the bakery to be the highlight regarding the food.  The pandulce was excellent - if a bit more fresh (than Ranch Market) given the way it's stored behind a glass case rather than self-service.  The conchas and pineapple empanadas were soft, sweet and delicious - with perfect texture.  Everything from churros, to cakes, to flan, to sweet breads, to donuts and rolls.

When I want to feel REALLY white, I just roll on down to Ranch Market to confirm my suspicions that, yes, I am in fact not as Hispanic as I think I am.  This store is what Food City WISHES it was!  It takes the best of Mexican specialty stores and eateries and combines it all under one roof.  Shoppers here are mostly Hispanic with a few adventurous gringos thrown in here and there.  But workers there are friendly and know English - some better than others.  Holy crap!  I can't believe it's taken me so long to review this place.  I only go here ALL the time for cheap delicious down-home Mexican food, cheap produce, and Spanish rice like Grandma used to make.  I've been going to Ranch Market for about 10 years at their stores in Bakersfield -- where they first started.  I used to make fun of my mom for going to lunch here.  Heh, look who's laughing now.  I'm addicted!  The food here is no-frills authentic and seats inside are picnic bench style.  It's not uppity Mexican fare like Barrio Cafe, but it's not Filiberto's diarrhea fare either.  Everything from chile colorado, chile verde, calabasitas, sopes, mole,  tortas, carnitas, chicharrones, tamales, ceviche.  You name it, they have it.   And that's just in the deli.  They have a panaderia with all kinds of cakes, flans and pandulce (sweet bread).  I LOOOVE pandulce.  They even have a jugeria (juice bar) tortilleria, and a counter for fresh cheeses and cremas.   And the produce?  Cheap and abundant.  I got some bananas and tomatoes just a little over one dollar.  Don't think about getting any organic veggies here.  This isn't the place.  This is also not the place for low-fat shopping either.  But it is so many other great things that the other stores aren't.  Best of all is the atmosphere inside - it is REALLY festive - like you're at Tia and Tio's fiesta.  Mariachis and bands abound here during the weekend.   Dang!!   Fry's, Safeway, Basha's - take note, por favor.  You're on notice.

Been here a few times, but most recently the other day.  Taking Mona's suggestion - I had the andouille sausage linguine and it was decent.  My friend had the flank steak that I wish I had ordered.  It was cooked to perfection and rested in a blackberry mole reduction.  On previous visits, I've had the atlantic salmon and vegetable lasagna - both great choices.  The service is usually good, except this time I felt the server was either overly attentive - borderline rushing us....but it wasn't a big deal.  The environs are terrific - white tablecloths with kitschy cute 1940s classroom chairs.  Weird touch, but retro cool.  A recommended central Phoenix favorite.  UPDATE - 1/25/07 The hostess was very gracious and accommodating checking on us every so often as we had drinks and waited for our table.  The owner came out and chatted with us after the meal to make sure everything we great, and even went back to the chef to clarify ingredients for me, plus added a little back story on the halibut sandwich w / german potato salad.  Definitely a friendly, homey atmosphere.  Loved it.

This delightfully charming grocery is proof that Phoenix is more diverse than it appears at the surface.  99 Ranch Market has inspired me to get off my butt and try something new and daring in the kitchen.  Anyone up to try some of Stevey's experimental egg rolls or sushi?  It's not for the faint of heart.  So if seeing chopped-up giant catfish heads and eyeballs or hundreds of huge fish swimming in a tank makes you queasy, 99 Ranch Market may not be for you.    But if you don't mind feeling like the only non-Asian within 300 yards in hopes of scoring some ingredients (meats, breads, pastries, green tea ice cream, veggies, fresh seafood, rice and noodles) to whip up an incredible feast, by all means run (don't walk) to 99 Ranch Market.

The Breakroom could be considered the home bar for the dregs from your local DMV or nearby Walmart.  Not real pretty, a little scary for the weak, rough around the edges, but real nevertheless.  I met up with Max and his bevy of beauties for Thursday night karaoke - bulletproof vest optional.   Yes, the bar is dumpy with caved in ceilings, classroom lighting, broken ceiling fans and probably hasn't changed since 1982, but the Bacardi cokes were $2. Two. Dollars. WTF?!  The song list here was extensive - one of the larger lists akin to George and Dragon.  The crowd was all over the place as others mentioned and got noticeably younger as the night went on.  The emcee was friendly and cool and roamed the room with his wireless mike while he noshed on a make-me-vomit value meal from McDonalds.  He was a decent emcee until he decided to sing Freedom 90 with me and totally screw it up with his deep gravelly voice - nearly drowning my seasoned, tried and true rendition.   I probably won't go back for karaoke unless Max (bevy of beauties in tow) and/or my Mafioso cousins from the Bay Area are with me.

Zoo Lights in December is a definite must do if you have kids.  But even if you don't,  it's a great place to snuggle up with a date, walk around with a beer and enjoy the thousands of lights hung throughout the walkways.  Besides that visit, I've also been in June when I've gotten to see the giraffe habitat and meeting areas.  There's also a banquet hall on-site too.  The zoo itself is decent size.  It's not TOO big and expensive like the San Diego Zoo where you have to budget your time and dollars wisely.  But it's also not a tiny zoo where you finish seeing it in an hour.  At $14 adult tickets are pretty reasonable.  They have all kinds of themed days/nights with fun programming for kids.  It was even recently voted as one of the top 5 zoos in the U.S. for kids.

I don't care much for Basha's and I really can't stand Food City (see Phoenix Ranch Market), but AJ's is how the Basha family does it right.    My friend Bobo and I didn't even flinch yesterday when our total for two ribeye steaks, asparagus spears and corn cobs came out to nearly $50, because we knew we were getting high-quality grub.  I don't come here often these days, probably because I used to come here all the time when I dated some pretentious A-HOLE a while back who preferred AJ's at all costs.  But I do come here when I prepare for dinner parties I'm hosting, go to brunches or just want to feel nostalgic for Bristol Farms and Gelson's from back home.  You can never go wrong with ANY of their food whether its croissants or desserts from their boulangerie (which is French for "I'm a fancy bakery you can't afford, you chump"), the butcher block, pizza counter or cheese deli.  But my absolute favorite part about AJ's is their wine selection and florist area.  I was gratifyingly reassured when I showed up to the home of Kristin S one day with the same exact cava, that lo and behold, we both religiously drink.  And when you're on the run you can always be sure they will have a trained wine sommelier help you in a pinch and chill a bottle for you in minutes.  If you're looking to be romantic and get laid, this is a one-stop shop with the fresh fruit salad in the deli case, cheeses, wine, chocolate selection, flowers all under one roof -- plus Castle Boutique is just one block over.  Score!

Yes, it's true.  You will hear British accents here. One of the better neighborhood bars in central Phoenix, George & Dragon is also one of the best British pubs in Arizona.  A very friendly and diverse crowd - I made some of my first friends here in AZ at George & Dragon.    Not exactly like a typical British/Irish pub crowd - as this place is frequented by a more punk-rock, rag-tag, counter-culture bohemian crowd.  Whatevs.  It keeps things interesting.  People playing darts or pool are always up for talking and invite you to join in.  The bartenderesses here are always very nice and well endowed at the same time.  Beer selection is among the best in Central Phoenix it would make any discerning Brooklyn hipster drool with delight. Chimay, Tetley's, Stella Artois, Kronenburg, Boddington and Anchor Steam are among the brews available. The jukebox is a gem - everything from The Kinks to the Police, David Bowie and Tom Jones.    No Country Karaoke on Mondays is a riot, and has one of the hugest song lists in town from which to choose.  They have also recently added a 1960s British mod dance night on Wednesdays.

Blockbuster this ain't!  This is quite possibly the best independent video store in greater Phoenix.  It regularly wins "Best of Phoenix" type accolades and for good reason.  It's small, locally-owned and specializes in hard-to-find titles - with hundreds of foreign (French, Spanish, etc...I even found an Israeli title once), black & white films, arthouse-indie flicks, and a large gay and lesbian selection - along with other films (wink wink) as well.    My favorite section has to be the area organized by famous directors and cult selections.  I admit I have splurged on a few David Lynch and John Waters marathons thanks to Movies on Central.  My only gripe is the time limit on rentals (two days on new releases) and they close early (10 pm during the week).  But it's not a big deal in the grand scheme of things.  The staff here is always friendly and helpful, and who can not smirk at the high-heel easy chair in the Central Ave. window?  Two words for that:  Fucking Klassy.

I was fooled.  The unassuming strip mall exterior and the fact that it shares a wall partition with a blech sister restaurant (Tokyo Express) had me fooled.  Even the overwhelmingly positive reviews didn't inspire me to go.  But make no mistake, this place is fantastic.   I am embarrassed to say that I only ended up here because Lola and Padres (Oregano's was too long of a wait) were both closed on Sunday night -- and I pass by this place all the time.  Really good noodles and pasta done Asian Fusion style and totally cheap.  The noodle dishes here are eight or nine dollars and have huge portions.  I ordered the haruki yakisoba noodle stirfry with pork and shrimp - which came to me in a large bowl and steaming with soy and ginger flavors.  The Korean spicy noodle bowl also outdid itself with sliced beef strips and a wonderfully hot hot hot taste.  If that's not your thang, they have rice bowls, sushi, salads, about 20 Italian/Med dishes and several vegetarian and tofu dishes.  You'll find that they have an open kitchen so if you're close to it you can spy and  salivate over everyone else's food.  The servers were all very prompt and courteous after a slow start.  A solo diner next to us was raving about the place and how much he loves it.   My favorite part of the food was definitely the complimentary cinammon bread crisps and bread basket that came with BANANA BREAD?!?  Wtf, whew, that came out of left field.  An awesome and delicious surprise that was.  They had a small wine list that was half off for that night -- as a nightly special.  Did you hear that?  HALF OFF!!  All the sudden that $30 bottle of pinot looked pretty damn good.  So for $15 we had four glasses of wine on the cheap.  The owners know the one way to my heart -- wine specials!!  Yes, it's official.  I'm easy.  When I got the tab did I realize that dinner here (with the wine) was CHEAPER than breakfast earlier that day at Orange Table.  Only then, did everything in life make sense.  Lesson:  Sketchy looking strip mall restaurant does not equal dump.   P.S.  The tiny parking lot gets crowded very quickly and street parking with Oregano's next door can be problematic.

Renting chairs and grabbing some paper plates and party supply stuff here couldn't have been more easy.  Aside from the surly but efficient front office help this place was alright.  Plus, it's called Party People - sawwweeet name!  The surly office staff are clearly NOT party people.  I needed some extra chairs for a dinner party and remembered seeing this place on 7th St.  At 90 cents each and two day rental - I thought it was quite the steal.  You pay for it inside then drive around the back to pick up your tables, chairs, linens, etc.  They load it up for you and off you go in a matter of minutes.    I would definitely return for my party rental needs.

Remember moments from Seinfeld when Elaine and George had run-ins at the corner Jewish bakery with chocolate babka and marble rye?   Well, that experience (minus the neuroticism) can be had here in Phoenix at Karsh's.   No need to go to Scottsdale or New York.  I've gone for breakfast for pastries and have been pleasantly surprised with the cookies, cakes, pies, cupcakes and bread.  The feel is just as similar.  Small digs with number pulls (the Now Serving sign is probably the oldest one I've ever seen!) and brick surroundings just like the Seinfeld TV show.  I've seen little New York Jewish ladies (ala Mrs. Costanza) inside gab, gloat and do "cawfee tawk" about the wonders of Karsh's.  The black and white cookie is amazing as Curtis states.  But the other few items we had (muffins and eclairs) were just as heavenly.   The black and white cookies were decorated this month in Suns garb (Go Suns!), the cinnamon rolls were good, and the cupcakes were so good and moist to give Tammie Coe cupcakes a run for their money. Also, some items are noted "pareve" for those who are lactose intolerant, and there are quite a few items.   But best of all, the bagels were terrific.  Enough to give you a second thought on your Einstein or Brueggers chain bagels you're feeding to others.

I like the servers at my local NY delicatessen to be like they are at Scott's Generations:  * Surly 60 years old ladies * Low on convo * High on service * Standard WTF look accompanied with an occasional  "I'm not amused" look.  I came here for breakfast again the other day and it was hopping with singles, retirees and families.  You walk in and seat yourself. The place is your typical strip mall storefront that stretches back lengthwise with a next door addition. On one side you'll find a series of naughahyde booths and on the other side you'll find the cash register, kitchen, deli counter where you can order fat free bialys, Hanukkah cookies, gefilte fish, latkes or side salads and luncheon meats by the pound.   Breakfast here is dirt cheap. The breakfast sandwich is $4.  Eggs, hamsteak, home fries (sauteed with seasoning and grilled onions) and a bagel is $5 something.  Surly little old lady servers take your order and shout it into the kitchen - all old school and stuff.  Once my friend (who dislikes bell peppers) ordered the corned beef hash skillet and was disappointed to see bell peppers in the hash. We told the server and she brought out an entirely new dish, with new eggs and home fries.  No sigh. No face. No questions asked.   Lunch and dinner looks pretty good - an extensive selection of sandwiches and traditional deli favorites.  Haven't had it though.  I can't seem to make it there by the geriatric last dinner time of 5 pm and 8 pm throughout the week (!)  Food here is probably 3.5 stars.  Service here is a solid 4 stars.

Now, I can think of several places in town that serve amazing pizza - La Grande, and Pizzeria Bianco come immediately to mind.  But Pizza Heaven gets 4 stars for other reasons.  It's cheap, tasty no-frills kind of pizza , with something for everyone.    The pizza itself is thin crust with a nice crispy, yet doughy taste.  The ham, cheese (very good cheese, btw) and mushrooms I had on pizza tasted fresh and the toppings were generous.    Something that sets it apart is the wide variety of toppings and the restaurant's perceived desire to offer something for everyone.  The menu includes more than 20 veggie toppings, lowfat cheese and soy cheese upon request - something you don't find much of at a pizza joint - much less the fancy pizza palaces of Phoenix!    The decor inside is very simple - chairs and tables - no booths.  They had the basketball game on TV in the background, and even have a live band on Friday and Saturday night - not sure on the type of music.  Give them a call to find out.   They serve the normal selection of pizza, pasta, subs and salads and even have a limited offering of beer and wine for the tipplers out there...  BTW: The location is new - having relocated up the road to bigger digs (now at 5150 N 7th St. betw. Camelback and Missouri).

Crooning gay men and their friends tear it up at this joint, which is regularly recognized by the media - (both straight and gay) as the best karaoke bar in the Valley.  I have been coming here a while ever since I used to hop the fence from my old apartment complex a few blocks away.  I can tell you that this place can't be beat in the fun for value dept.  I mean where else can you get $4 Absolut and tonics - plus free (oftentimes campy and klassy) entertainment.  The crowd, the singing skills and the singing tastes here run the gamut, and that's part of the appeal.    The crowd is mostly gay men in their 30s and 40s, but goes older and younger.  Lesbians also hold court here as well.  I mean, who else will do the honors to sing Pat Benatar and Melissa Etheridge?  Many gay men will bring their straight girlfriends, most likely so they will have someone to sing the Grease duet with.  And believe it or not, a handful of straight men will be dragged here.  But not to fear.  The crowd is very friendly and welcoming and the bartenders and owners take care of the people here.  As for what kind of music to expect, some people are completely hammered and singing in public for the very first time, while others are serious and more seasoned - some with classical training via the Phoenix Men's Choir.    And a few of these guys would make American Idol drool with desire.   The song list is large and respectable (but think George and Dragon has a better list - see my review...).  The songs run the spectrum from Liza Minelli Cabaret, to Tim McGraw, to hip-hop rap, to 80s alt rock, to U2, AC/DC, Elton John, Stevie Wonder, and Frank Sinatra.  This place is totally small and divey -and a bit weathered looking when you speed past it on 7th St.  Useless trivia alert.  For any Phoenix architectural history buffs out there, this bar is identical to Chez Nous (without the booths, and not as DARK) as both buildings were built by the same man.   Karaoke runs from Thursday night through Saturday night.  And they have other themed evenings throughout the week incl. (I am not making this up) the Greek God Revue stripper show hosted by catty drag queens on Sunday night.

I spilled my drink all over my significant other and the table and the others in my party (Christine, Kristin, etc.) spilled their kamikaze shots all over the tables and karaoke books and I still did not get kicked out (or dumped by said S.O.).  Score.  But the reason I am updating is because the bar owners (Ron and Lee) asked me to update since "we're not divey anymore..."  and they aren't. Classroom carpet gave way to faux-finish wood floors, new plasma screens replaced the old TVs, old furnishings gave way to new tables and barstools with wrought iron backs (but the OG swivel naugahyde chairs still lurk at the bar, thanks guys).   My original review was almost a year and a half ago before their interior remodel and new outdoor patio (as a response to the 2006 smoking in bars ban).

As another reviewer wrote this place definitely feels LGO in ways. But not exactly, it feels like a not-as-hip twin LGO grocery/wine store in Omaha, circa 1983.  Not that that's bad or anything.  There's always some nostalgic value for places that concentrate on food and comfortable homey environ so that they aren't so hip it hurts.  My first visit to Duck and Decanter was on a recent Thursday for lunch and was filled with the normal Camelback Corridor office drones and car salesmen. Delicious mix of people I tell you, but even more delicious was the maple glazed ham and muenster sandwich on whole wheat topped with avocado.  My lunch buddy opted for the tuna and it was pretty tasty but not the best I have ever had.  The pricing was average and with chips and a soda came out to about $10. Bonus points for the cheese selection feature bite-sized samples for a dollar or so.   The wine store was small and charming and the layout of the place is so unconventional (with most seating upstairs) that it makes for some fascinating exploring once you get over the overwhelming collection of tacky bric a brac everywhere.   I'm disappointed that it's kind of hidden, but that's probably best since I would be here all the time for a sammie and some wine come happy hour. Is it 4 pm yet?

Fish Market gets a solid four stars from me. I hadn't been to Fish Market in four years until I went twice in the last 2 weeks. It's my friend's favorite, but he's a big fan of their sushi happy hour, of which I was skeptical. Both times (on a Friday and a Saturday) this place was hopping.  A couple of weeks ago, the host had flubbed our reservation, but was super apologetic and hooked up some free appetizers, when there was really no need.  The crab and bay shrimp cocktail was just alright, but the ginger lime prawns with cilantro sauce was savory and stellar in its own right -- they should make that an entree.   Last but not least were the calamari fritte, which my friend remarked was the best in town.  You be the judge though. For dinner I ordered the misoyaki glazed scottish atlantic salmon with grilled veggies.  For what I thought was a small portion the taste of the fish made me forget about portion size, and who am I kidding? - I was stuffed on appetizers!  Last Friday I had the happy hour sushi and was impressed, especially with the Senorita roll. This $18 roll is pricey but at it's $9 happy hour price is well worth it. The crab roll covered in tuna sits in a sweet eel sauce and garnished with sriracha sauce on top. It's a heavenly mixture of spicy/sweet, east meets west. Their $4 house chardonnay is a great value as well. The setting of the happy hour bar and the mixing and mingling of patrons makes it obvious that this is a regulars sort of place.  Criticisms?  Very little, except to say don't go expecting to be wowed with ambiance.  The look is nautical and fish markety - hence the name. Dur. I love the fact that they actually sell fish, but on second thought, who the hell buys any at $19/pound?  And for those who are sketched out on the idea of seafood in Phoenix -- they fly it in from the coast fresh daily. But PLEASE FISH MARKET, please do something about the ghastly lighting... is it really necessary to have it so bright in there?!  Is this a seafood restaurant done classroom style?

I presume this is how hipster dive bars begin. I recall a Time Out Chicago article I once read that deconstructs the particulars of dive bar development.    On the Darwinian continuum of diveyness Angelo's Lounge must be an amoeba. This has all the trappings of a hipster dive bar, but it falls short of the features you find at places like Bikini, Shady's or places in Tempe. Perhaps 10 years from now this will be a hipster hot spot.  Lately with new ownership they're reportedly starting to book bands more often.  I went here with Bonnie to see a friend's band perform and I couldn't believe the inside of this place. It was freaking surreal like watching a bad movie in slow motion. Is that really 70s inspired outdoorsy silhouette wallpaper (photo posted above) on every inch of the walls? Is that really an 70 year old alcoholic trucker with a ZZ Top beard sitting three stools down from an indie-rock 25 year old Tempe girl?  Here's what else you can expect: * Two pool tables. * No beers on tap, but Miller High Life by the bottle. * Cash only. * Mismatched floors. * Gross bathrooms with 80s-glitter inlaid sinks * Brick fireplace in the corner. * Jukebox with Linkin Park, Reba McEntire and Neil Diamond. Nuff said.  * Falling water: the untrendy kind - like from a leaking roof here and there throughout. * Decrepit ceiling fans that looked like they were about to fall and go flying. *A veritable Mason-Dixon line of humanity: sketchy, trashy looking old fogeys and their admirers toward the front, indie rock-luvin hipsters toward the back. We were probably somewhere near Philly. And best of ALL... * A gigantic velvet landscape painting with a 6 inch gash in the middle. Klassy!

Chimayo Chicken, Cakebread and the corner circular booth by the seductive fireplace.  Five stars.    I finally made it here the other night.  An attempt to go here last summer was quashed by a kitchen fire.  Needless to say, the blue crab tostadas also impressed.    The ambiance at Rokerij is such that you just want to stay and relax for the rest of the night -- (I was late to my next Friday night stop!!). The dark cavernous feel of the place lends itself well to a special night out.  Wine service was adept and the server was refilling our chardonnay very regularly.   The chimayo chicken was stellar - decked out and rolled with spinach, sundried tomatoes, poblano chile, asiago cheese and drizzled with an onion sauce and accompanied by mashed potatoes served in a green chile. A stunning combination of flavors -- spicy, smoky, rich and healthy at once.

I can't believe I have ignored NYPD Pizza for the past few years. I think I subconsciously thought I was going to get arrested or something.  I must have walked/driven past this place at least 200 times without a second thought of going in until last week. The joke is on me.  Taking the sister, her hubby and the kiddies for dinner in Central Phoenix and finding a restaurant we would all like was a challenge and thanks to Oregano's having a 2 hour Saturday night wait - which is par for the course - we ended up here.  NYPD Pizza and a 20 minute wait?  We're sold.  Another must was a TV for the NFL playoffs which they showed in the small bar area. As for the interior, it very much felt like a neighborhood cafe with the interior brick facade and stringed lights criss-crossing the room.  Well, NYPD Pizza delivered and then some.  They liked their pizza, minestrone and garlic bread knot thingies.  The girls got kids sized spaghetti and meatball, a coloring paper menu and crayons.  I needed to overload on carbs for a big race the next day so I ordered pasta.  My baked ziti with sausage was absolutely delicious.  Having had that same dish at Oregano's, it is much better than what they serve.  If you're not a fan of cheese you probably won't like the ziti at NYPD.  But since I love cheese, it hits the spot.  I wouldn't have been able to tell the difference in water in the taste of their dough, but apparently the fact that they import their water from Brooklyn is a big deal.  Kinda pretentious if you ask me, but hey, I like the extra effort and I liked the fact that I did not get arrested.

This is easily one of the best if not THE BEST happy hour value in the Valley.  I hold Caffe Boa very highly in that regard too.  I was a regular for McCormick and Schmick's happy hour in Downtown LA.  Since moving to Phoenix, I seem to forget it's even here, in it's hidden Esplanade office tower location.  Five appetizers are $1.99 and another handful are $4.99.  Their claim to their happy hour fame is the 1/2 pound angus burger.  The Angus burger, which comes with steak fries, is decently sized and pretty good for $2 bucks.  Not the best burger I have ever had, but good considering the chump change you pay, it's a steal. Bobo and I splurged and ordered enough food for everyone in the bar, where you could just about hear a pin drop.  The calamari strips and grilled salmon cakes were pretty good too.  Bass and Hef on tap are $5 each.  Granted we were also there at 9 pm for their reverse happy hour, (which is another added bonus) and watched as the last of the douchey corporate expense account 24th and Camelback crowd dwindled.  Service by the outgoing server Teresa was solid, and if you're even remotely in the area, I highly suggest it for some good cheap fun post-work.  If it wasn't for the happy hour it would probably be a three star place for the corporate seafood chainey feel.

Yes, it's cougarlicious. But I must admit, this is still one of my favorite bars.  I love that I can use the Merc as a bargaining chip to get my Scottsdale peeps to come into central Phoenix.  This place is not nearly as pretentious as its Scottsdale peers, and I love it for that.  Every server and bartender here is gorgeous, but nice, down to earth - one even offered to take photos of our party...  Make sure you bring your night vision goggles as the tableside tea lights don't help much.  Also cougars and their admirers are definitely on the prowl here.  Drinks are a bit pricey, but the moody, urban lounge ambiance makes up for it.

OK, I'm gonna take one for the team and admit it.  Is it bad that I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place?  No judging now.    I mean, I usually reject any restaurant remotely chain-like, but Cheesecake Factory, you are one of a handful of respectable chains that I like and frequent.     An easy solution when you don't know what you want to eat (you're sure to find something in the menu, yeah, it may take 40 minutes to decide, but whatever), or want to take Aunt Dorothy and Uncle Charlie from the Midwest somewhere fun, but not too edgy or Scottsdale-like.  Funny thing is I've had their cheesecake maybe about two times, because with the ridiculously large portions would I really have any room?  And if you're looking to totally WRECK your diet, this is your place - there's hardly anything healthy on the menu (but they did just start a lite salad menu).  My favorite appetizers are the avocado egg rolls and the sliders.  Grilled shrimp club, BBQ chicken pizza, blackened chicken sandwich,  chicken chipotle pasta, chicken romano, and chicken madeira are all REALLY good.  I guess I like chicken, huh?  FYI, they don't have a kids menu, which is really DUMB, because this place is such a family restaurant.  For those who care, they have Valet.  I mean, come on, really?  There is a parking structure on the other side of Macy's.  Valet in Phoenix with easy parking situation = lame.

Ahh, Trader Hoe's - how I LUV thee.  You are a cheaper version of Whole Foods and have (almost) everything I could ask for, and even grew for me over the last year.    You always have my cheap, easy-to-make foods, and a decent selection of wine.  And when you're feeling like slumming it, $2 buck chuck is $3 buck chuck in this neck of the country.  Another case in point to not having everything.  I inquired about low-fat tortilla chips and they told me - "Oh, you must have seen that in California.  They eat different things in California."  Huh?  Can a brother get some low-fat TJ's tortilla chips in this town?  I'm not asking for freaking foie gras.  Now you would be perfect if you had a fresh deli, bakery, hot foods and butcher block - but then you wouldn't be cheap, huh?  You would be Whole Foods.

This place screams style over substance.  In a sentence - trendy sexy Biltmore crowd fawns over overrated sushi.  I really don't get why Zen 32 is always so crowded and busy.  Could it be that people here don't know good sushi?  I find that I keep trying to give this place a chance and will go back simply because it's one of the only bonafide sushi bars in the area - and perhaps everyone else is doing the same as well.  But mediocrity, my friend, will eventually ruin this place.  Service and long waits are to be expected here.    I even think I got sick on the happy hour sushi here a while back.  I'm blaming it on the vodka tonic and not the warmed over salmon roll, but eater beware.  The bar can get crowded too, but they have some fun watercolor boards at the bar to play around with.  Back in the restaurant, the sushi is kind of lackluster.  The sashimi and rolls I've had here were so-so.  I just haven't found this place to measure up.

Awful, awful customer service - so bad in fact that we were too thoroughly disgusted to stay for the meal. We came here on a Sunday afternoon, which was my first and last time.  I've been to other Houston's locations in California - and have had decent times there.  In fact, I love the thai steak salad.   However, this time some 20 year old idiot host walked us to our table (and before we even sat down) and told us "My mom taught me good manners, so I've always taken my hat off at the dinner table."    Huh?  First of all, I was dressed nicely in a button up shirt, and was wearing my favorite football team hat who had just won the championship the day before.  Secondly, I hadn't even sat down at the table yet, asswipe.  Thirdly, while I understand this isn't Applebees, this also isn't Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, douche bag.  And don't talk to me like I'm 7 years old.  No sooner had the idiot host left before we walked into the kitchen to get the manager  to bitch him out about his insulting employee.  The manager was pretty much dismissive.  Well, guess what - I'm pretty much dismissive about this poor excuse for a restaurant.   1 STAR - not going back!!

3.5 Stars.  Having been to many 24 Hour Fitness locations, this one is my usual stomping ground.  This location is just OK.  Other "Sports" locations here and in CA are newer and hence - cleaner, larger and with better equipment.  This gym does offer decent equipment, but they could use a few more ab machines, some 40 pound dumbbells, and like someone else said -- a basketball court.  A number of 40 pound dumbbells have been missing for a while - like someone stole them, wtf? They also offer a number of extras - from the pool, spa, sauna, large aerobic rooms, chiropractor, and massage (extra charges of course).  The crowd here is typical of the area -- a mix of Central Phoenix/East Phoenix yuppies, local celebrities, soccer moms, and h.s./college students.  Like most gyms in existence, they suffer from the after work crowd.  And sometimes in the crazy days of January and February parking (even with the large lot) can be impossible - I've turned around and gone home on a few ocassions.  But if you avoid those times, you will be fine.

I had the good fortune of being able to relax a few mornings away here recently.   Definitely a little piece of New York in Arcadia - it has the feel of the many gourmet micro-grocery stores there.  I don't go here as much as I should, so I reluctantly recommend it to the rest...   * loud and busy in the morning and lunch times * a very cool incognito back-door entrance * very brunchy menu selections (incl. a great croque madame, sandwiches, omelettes, muffins and tarts) * jazz, Gipsy Kings, and Al Green classics wafting over the loud speakers * grocery stocked with knick knacks, cookbooks, imported pasta, fine wine, freshly made sushi, and of course, The New York Times  And, yes, the Spanish latte is every bit as incredibly and sweetly decadent as described.

One of my favorite places in Phoenix, that I don't frequent nearly enough.  Great selection of wines by the glass.  The atmosphere is sexy, industrial pseudo-warehouse, I-don't-think-I'm-in-Phoenix type lounge.  I think on Tuesdays they have a live DJ in the mix.    It's more of a wine bar than a restaurant and the menu reflects that - with the heaviest of items being their paninis.  The autostrada panini comes loaded with several meats (soppresatta and prosciutto among them) and cheeses and is amazing.  UPDATE - Great service just recently.  A bit of a wait, but forgot about it because of the great servers - Michelle I think, was one of them.  Just had a Tobin syrah that was incredible...

Yummy slider alert!    Much better than the average White Castle barf disk, and even better than the sliders at Cheesecake Factory.  I ordered three cheese sliders for a little over $3 (I know, I know, I was HON-gry!) and although they're small it was quite filling.  Nice use of soft rolls, dijon mustard, ketchup, minced onions and flavorful beef and cheese.  The inside is tacky -- with sports posters everywhere, arcade games, real Chicago street signs (think Kedzie, Cermak, Paulina, and Southport), and old newspaper clippings and tons of Best of Phoenix awards scattered throughout.  Vinyl booths line the front of the building with plastic patio tables as well.   I heard good things about their hot wings and hot dogs, so will def be back to try.  Super cheap, super Chicago divey-chic, and super good.

Gosh, I'm embarrassed to say I eat here. But Pei Wei, is a predictable, safe and tame alternative to figuring which Chinese take out places haven't violated any Maricopa County Health Dept. codes.  Amen on the more preferable wait vs. its monstrous cousin PF.  Personally, I dig the orange peel chicken and minced chicken lettuce wraps similar to the big cousin, but much prefer the more laid-back environs here.  Go Pei Wei.

So while it's off the beaten path, I actually kind of liked Sunset Bowl. I particularly liked the surly remarks from counter guy.  He was funny.  "Yes, you need to leave one shoe of your up here, because you know people really want these stylish bowling shoes of ours," he deadpanned.  It's cool. That's how they do it back in Cali. No biggie.  I did really like the bar area.  It's clear that they remodeled many parts of the facility from the front counter/shoe rental area to the U-shaped oak bar.  Big props to the bartender/TV controller who was with me on the whole Desperate Housewives thing if it was to show - which it didn't.  The minuses I have to say are the lack of tables at each alley and the archaic ball retrieval machine thingy - which lacked an air dryer.  When it comes down to it, Sunset Bowl just doesn't do it for me like Christown.  They have the perfect balance of retro-old and modern new.  3.5 stars.

Overall it's a really good airport for a city the size of Phoenix.  If you check in and print out your boarding pass beforehand and don't check any bags - you should be fine here.  The waits at security aren't that bad for the most part.  One of the highlights here is the award-winning art collection - noted as one of the best in an airport nationwide.  One reason this airport doesn't get 5 stars is the lack of access between terminals (all they offer is bus service) and between the airport and public transportation - supposedly a link with the future light rail system will come in 5 years or so.   The difference is terminals has been noted already - but personally I prefer using Terminals 2 and 3 to avoid the zoo that is Terminal 4 - especially to avoid the Southwest (Greyhound of the Skies) crowd.  But if you do have to deal with Terminal 4 - it is large and modern with people movers, offering almost anything you could possibly need.   I especially like Terminal 2 because it is smaller and less frantic.   Downside is there are less eateries.  An Arizona Republic article recently noted that Terminal 4 eateries (Starbucks, for example) charge significantly more than in other terminals - even for the same exact food and drink!

This is some CLASSY brunch.  I love it.  Hot damn, it was warm this morning, but not enough to make a difference on a 5-star place like The Farm at South Mountain.  I was in a rush to try this place out this weekend before it closed.  (FYI, it closes every summer from June - September.)  You pull up to the place in the midst of this vast city of ours to find a huge, and shady (in a good way) farm before you.  At the Morning Glory Cafe, the small menu has just the right mix of items to please just about anyone.  Lots of veggie options to be had here, btw (Bonnie would DROOL with desire here).  The food is really incredible.  They had my favorite dish on the menu - croque madame.  It had eggs, and some delicious asiago cheese and black forest ham on some crusty artisanal bread.  Ahh.  It was missing the bechamel sauce, but it made up for it with freshly-grown asparagus.  How did they know that's my favorite veggie?  I attribute it to kismet, of course.  It was accompanied by some terrific oven roasted potatoes baked in some spices and oil.  Nice...  The patio is cute in a rustic way.  Think checker tablecloths and white plastic chairs.  Not exactly sexy, but hey, it fits in the grand scheme of the farm.  They have a self serve area for water, lemonade and tea.    The mimosas here are the best part.  For only $7.50 you get your own mini champagne bottle and orange juice.  So you're getting the better end of the bargain with about a mimosa and a half!   Service here was a bit slow to start.  But after paying the check I spot a wandering blueberry scone that is calling my name.  (Even better, is their scones are featured in Cooking Light magazine too.  Man I love this place.) So I give in, place an order and ask for it to go.  She brings it out.  I ask to pay in cash, since she already ran my debit card, and she says "Don't worry about it."    CLASSY.  Classy, with a C.  The scone was DELICIOUS, btw.  Nice touch, and I leave her an extra tip for it.   Prices are higher than average for Phoenix.  Expect to throw down about $40 for two.  But let me tell ya, that will be the best $40 you've spent in a while.   I am now eager to try the other restaurants here.  Now if only September would hurry up and arrive....

Word to the wise.  Don't bring your Meg Ryan-like friend (who's allergic to seafood and nuts) to Roy's.  That small detail didn't occur to me at the time, until perusing the menu and realizing that almost everything includes seafood or is cooked in coconut oil or offered with a peanut sauce.    Oopsies.  But on the bright side I had most of the appetizers (sushi, satay and grilled shrimp) to myself.  Meanwhile my friend loaded up on rice and edamame and drank most of the bottle of chardonnay (in an ice bucket, btw) -- which funny enough made him pretty drunk by the end of dinner.  I really dig this Roy's and Roy's in general.  It reminds me of a fancy version of Kona Grill - more uptown, sedate, but not stuffy either.   And of course, I dig the dramatic entrance to the Marriott Desert Ridge and lofty lobby and staircases.  Very classy, but again -- not stuffy.   The open kitchen is a nice touch.  Something about open kitchens in restaurants always get extra points with me -- suggesting that the restaurant has nothing to hide, perhaps.     I ordered the grilled salmon and ponzu sauce with was grilled perfectly and the sauce giving it added flavor and oomph.  If you're a chocoholic or a dessert person, be sure to order the chocolate lava souffle in advance and save room - supposedly it's out of this world.

Stevey does Chandler, Part Deux.    So usually after Saigon Pho I continue my way into Chandler for some gelato to cap off my dinner.  Angel Sweet is some seriously good gelato.  Is it 5 stars?  I'm partial to Arlecchino's in Phoenix for that.  But if you're in the area, it's not a bad choice.  Beware of the crowds.  It's usually really busy.  The mango here is def. my favorite.  Yum.

Stevey does Chandler, Part I.  I know, can you believe it?  I do know how to go south and east of Tempe ya know?  I actually go there quite frequently (but not as often lately).  Where else am I gonna go to get my Asian grub on?  The area around Dobson/Warner is an emerging hub in Arizona for some bomb-ass Asian cuisine, and Saigon Pho is helping lead the way.  This place is crazy busy - especially on weekends - when I am usually able to hoof it down there.   I've been coming here for a while now.  The shrimp and beef bowl over noodles and the hot pot soups are both only about $5 - and a very tasty $5 at that.   An A+ for the smooth, but not too sweet Thai iced tea.  One drawback over the several times was finding a little gnat critter kickin it in my shrimp summer roll - an isolated incident I'm sure - but you should def.  know.  It's a bit nicer than most, inside it's little restaurant strip mall.  It looks kinda like it was an old diner in a previous incarnation from the naugahyde booths and cheap tile floors throughout.  They even have a fish tank, but it's not full of tropical fish, rather it's full of we're-about-to-cook-you crab.

I can't believe there's only three other reviews of this place.  OMG. Sakana is one of my favorite sushi places in Arizona.    Now Scottsdale and the rest of the Valley are not lacking in sushi restaurants - especially  trendy sceney places.  Yawn.  In fact, I found there to be more sushi bars than I expected for our desert outpost.  But what separates one from the others are: good food, fresh fish, good service, good value.  And this place def does it right...  Plus it's the only place I know of (can anyone help me out here?) in the area where I can find the holy grail of all sushi - the rich, but-gusting, let-me-workout-before-I-eat-this baked scallop roll.  Now, let me explain.   In "Sushi Heaven" (otherwise known to laymen as Ventura Blvd. in L.A.) there is this place that serves this and is known for this tasty delicacy.  But I have yet to find a place that serves the baked scallop roll (basically a california roll covered in warmed baked scallops), but along came Sakana.   Prices are reasonable, the decor is a happy medium - not too trendy, not too drab.  I never have to wait here - but always find myself waiting when I go to RA.  Whatever.  Something is wrong with that picture...  The crowd ranges the spectrum from older couples, families with kids, younger couples, and friends catching up after work.  I hear there are other locations throughout the Valley, but this is the one I frequent.   Another bonus for this place is the location away from Old Town Scottsdale and the parking headaches there.  Here, however, you will find parking to be easy since it's in an Albertson's strip mall.

I think I was imagining cigarette stained walls, low-slung ceilings and trashy looking people, but I was WAY off.  Casino Arizona is a really gorgeous casino.  I haven't been to many casinos here, but if you closed your eyes, fell asleep and woke up on the casino floor [not that I've done that or anything] you might think you're in Las Vegas.  Everything you can find in casino there, you can find here - slots, betting,  roulette, you name it.  I was here for a company Christmas party a couple of weeks ago and schmoozed, boozed and nibbled on appetizers.  The food was delicious.  I wasn't surprised though, because I've heard their fancy restaurant, Cholla, is critically acclaimed. I recall all the food served cocktail-style as being delicious - the highlights being the coconut fried shrimp, foccacia pizza, charcuterie plate and roasted veggies.  And all the cocktail waitresses walk around Vegas-style mumbling "Cocktails? Cocktails?"  You can get your Beatles cover band fix every few months or so when Beatlemania performs.  Yes, it does sell out every time too. Besides that and Showstoppers, you can find the comedian circuit or occasional big-name performer stop here.  Don Rickles was performing last week.   It's not Las Vegas, and shouldn't be considered as such.  But for the serious gambler or the tourist who might be itching to throw down a few, Casino Arizona might just do the job.

WOW.  What awesome, professional, same-day, we-come-to-you window replacement service!  Sun Devil Auto Glass was the silver lining in an otherwise stab-my-eyeball experience.  They came in at the cheapest of 3 places I quoted that morning.  I called them for a quote at 7:30 AM, they had my window in-stock AND replaced by 12:30 PM that day AND in my office PARKING LOT!!  Even the window-replacer guy was pleasant and fun to talk with.   If you're ever in a bind like this - Sun Devil Auto Glass will come to the rescue and for cheap!

I was really looking forward to some great BBQ, but I definitely wasn't expecting to get dry pulled pork from El Paso.  And when I say dry, I mean dry - like the Salt River, fools.  I had heard such good things about this place.  And to be fair, the rest of the food was really good.  It smells of smoked mesquite when you walk in and really does up that wooden western look throughout.  A big lunch group of us were seated near the center of the room next to a rad antique industrial-sized grill.   I thought the jalapeno cornbread was the standout item here, which along with the honey butter was a great complement to the kick-your-ass spicy/sweet BBQ sauce.  The steak fries (not too crispy and not too soft) and cowboy baked beans were surprisingly terrific as well.   The service was OK, it seemed the server was in a cranky mood for some reason -- but it wasn't horrible.   The pork though, was just really bad - stringy and overcooked.  Perhaps it was an isolated incident - but inexcusable still.  Had I had more time than my already short lunch hour I would have sent it back.  But consider yourself warned.

Totally underwhelming Mexican food.  Even Macayo's and Chipotle burritos have cost less with bigger portions, and tasted better.  I ordered a simple rice, bean and guacamole ($6.95) burrito for lunch.  I mean, how hard can that be to MESS up?    But they piled some warm slimy goop (frijoles, I imagine) in a tortilla and called it done.  I have heard this location has been several other ill-fated restaurants before.  Let's hope this one can stay a while.  Lunch service was slower than expected - only 2 servers but with 10 parties.  Their signature dish was the poco pollo - basically a chicken chimi with heart clogging jalapeno cream cheese - a standard dish at most Mexican eateries.  Might be worth it - who knows? The inside decor is nice a warm modern Mexican look, but with booths and cheap tables/chairs throughout.  They also serve tequila and margaritas yet have NO BAR.  WTF?

I'm always encouraged when sushi chefs have no idea what I'm saying and when other Asians patronize the place.   So when the Tokyo Lobby sushi chef stared at me blankly when I asked a question, I thought, oh my gosh, that must mean that he's like really Japanese or something.   And when the Sun City Asian ladies rolled in for lunch - its fate was sealed.  My sushi confidence shot straight up.  Nice!  For the past 3 years I avoided this place.  Why would any respectable sushi place locate itself in an aging dumpy Walmart strip mall?  I peeked inside way back when and wasn't impressed.  But after reviews of this place, I knew I had to check it out.  Wow, was I wrong.  This place holds its own against any Scottsdale sushi joint, without the flash.  It moved into its new location within the strip mall last week, and it's a bit bigger, more modern, but still modest.  My second visit (today) I tried the bento box - a steal at only $7 that comes with teriyaki beef, rice, spicy tuna, california roll, salad and miso soup.   And I've been stuffed all day.   The highlights here clearly are the inventive rolls - reminds me a bit of Blue Wasabi with cutesie names like the Glendale roll and the Monkeyface roll (crab, fried mushrooms and avocados).  Mmmm.  This has definite 5 star potential, I'm just waiting for my next visit.

What better way to follow up a review of the dumpy Metrocenter than with the classy Arrowhead Country Club.   I just went here for lunch the other day with a friend whose husband is the chef here.  So needless to say, this review is of the clubhouse dining - not the golfing.  The food here is pretty good.  It's your average country club fare -- upscale, but a bit conservative.    I was so tempted to walk in the joint with a sweater draped over my back and shoulders and tell them my name is Carlton, but I held it in.  I ordered the chicken with a wine mushroom sauce and rice pilaf.  Good, but par for the course (no pun intended).   Service was polite and quick, as it always is when I've been here for business meetings.  I've also been here for a number of rubber chicken banquet dinners - so I know what to expect.    The clubhouse facility itself is decent (not as fabulous as you might think), but the banquet set-up is a bit small, semi-circular, and is downstairs, so you feel like you're in some kind of basement.  I keep asking for a certain member named Jordin Sparks, but she never seems to be around....dang it.

This club was really creepy.   Aside from the impressive two story set-up with pool tables and  loungey space upstairs, I was not impressed. Our group was really out-of-place. Our ladies weren't dressed sleazy or tacky enough with cheapy slutty clothing. And our guys weren't dressed generically enough (think black/white mall-wear). Drinks were much weaker than the previous establishment we went to (Fox and Hound).  Ahh, the things I will do for friends. Going to Mc Duffy's for a friend's birthday night out is one of those gestures. My McDuffy's good deed has me off the hook for another year I suppose. I was actually having more fun at Fox and Hound and wish we had stayed there.  An extra star for the doorman knowing one of the girls in the group, letting the guys in our group bypass the $10 cover. $10 too much in my opinion.

As the nicer of the two Ah-Sos in Arrowhead,  I dig this one better.  It's newer, larger and more stylish.    This place rakes the people in for lunch time, and you have the option to sit teppenyaki style (around a huge grill) or at a table.  We always opt for teppenyaki.  Never much of a wait for lunch, but I understand dinner can be hectic in this corner of the Valley known for Applebees and Chilis.  The food here is fresh, flavorful and always done up with a typical entertainer-like cleaver chop show - and service by these guys is usually stoic and efficient.  This time I ordered the grilled shrimp and chicken done up with fried rice and veggies - and it was delicious.  I tend to stay away from the sushi although they do have it here - so can't speak to that.  I come here infrequently, as lunch can set you back $15 - $20 or so.  But make no mistake - it's worth it.

So I've admitted in the Biltmore location's review that I secretly LOVE Cheesecake Factory, but this particular location stinks.    Lunch is always busy, and service (up to now) was so-so.  But most recently my co-workers took me to lunch here for my birthday, and here is how the exchange with our 22 year old skanky server went. I swear I am not making this up.  We place our orders and then my co-workers call over our server.  Let's call the 22 year old skanky server Tammy McSleazerston.  Co-workers:  (point over at me like I'm not there, as if to request some kind of retarded ice cream, song and dance freebie) It's his birthday today, could we have some kind of something for him. TM:  (In baby voice, and taking her index finger and pointing at her right cheek) Aww, is it your boothday tuhday Mishtuh Man?? Me:  (Stunned, and not knowing what to say)  Um yeah. TM says she'll be back, and walks away. Me and Co workers:  (Look at each other jaw-dropped)  We finish lunch, they give me my stupid ice cream, and we leave a crappy tip and a note to the manager to rein in his flippant servers -- and no apology, or other response.

I went to my first ever ATC play "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" last night  and it was a fun experience.  I dragged some friends with me and we made it a classy night. Classy with a C, that is. They are a great local theater company worthy of praise.  I found the adaptation featuring four different Hydes (incl. a woman) to be very entertaining and compelling.    The credentials of each of the actors were impressive and while there were moments of cheese in the acting, overall the acting was pretty decent.  The man in front of us bailed after the first act, so I guess not everyone shared that opinion.  The crowd, like most performing arts audiences, was much older on average, so if that's not an issue for you, you should enjoy it.    Our comped seats were much better than I expected.  I thought I was gonna be in nosebleed heaven, but we were in the 12th row of the Orchestra section.  Not bad, not bad. I wish every comped ticket in LYFE was that good.

I'm a bit conflicted about the Phoenix Art Museum.  I was just talking about that to someone doing graduate work at ASU in museum studies - who also seemed to agree with me.    While it's a good museum and the expansion has given it more space and a more sweeping, dramatic entrance, they could have worked out a few more kinks in the layout and flow of the museum.  The boundaries between galleries are not exactly clear.  You're not entirely sure which gallery you've entered.  It still feels disjointed after the expansion, and a few galleries are built like Avondale cul-de-sacs.  Perhaps I've been to too many museums on the coasts, and I'm being nitpicky here, but the layout does strike me as rather odd.  Phoenix Art Museum is still a great way to pass the day.  The collection is stronger than I expected with an emphasis on American art from the 19th and 20th centuries, and the visiting exhibitions are always impressive.  Make sure to check out the photography gallery and the contemporary art gallery with the hanging LED lights / dark room - you'll feel kinda drunk and woozy without the $60 bar tab.  Past exhibitions have included Annie Leibovitz and Frank Lloyd Wright.  There's a great view of the Central Corridor skyscrapers from the glass wall overlook on the 3rd floor!

This little spot is my favorite public space in downtown Phoenix.  Heritage Square evokes a metropolitan feel focusing on past, present and future.  I think it's the juxtaposition of the old historic houses against the rising modern skyline to the west.  Or maybe it's the ethnic and cultural festivals galore, where I can catch sumo wrestling or hula dancers. Or perhaps it's the fact that it's a walkable city block and also host to the Arizona Science Center, Phoenix Museum of History and other historical houses or great restaurants like Pizzeria Bianco.   It might be a combination of all of those things. I have spent many weekends here, too many to count. While I dig the ethnic festivals in particular (just went to the Indian festival the other day) - it's also host to the Rainbows Festival, which celebrates the GLBT community and diversity and is one of the largest street festivals in Phoenix.   I am diggin on you, Heritage Square. Werd!

This is a great place to see a mass market act here in Arizona.  It's a very post-modern version of the spectacular Wiltern (LA), Pantages (LA), or Fillmore (SF) here in Phoenix.  As a relatively new performance venue, you can rest assured that you'll see a good show here - with good lighting and sound equipment to be had here.  It seats up to 5,000 in this venue and has good sightlines from most seats.  Seats might be a tight squeeze for you if you've got junk in your trunk.  I have seen Margaret Cho, Nelly Furtado, and The Fray here, and they have always been decent experiences.  Levy (like Chase Field) does the food/drink service here, btw.

I'm really torn on this 4 star rating.  The Biltmore Fashion Park is my favorite mall in the Valley, but is not exactly five-star worthy -- hence the four stars.    PROS * Outdoor set-up (with grassy lawns and flower pots) * Hip 1960s modern architecture (which let's face it, is historic in our city) * Small scale of the mall (makes it easier to park/walk) * Arizona's only Sak's Fifth Avenue (where I go for my Kiehl's skin care fix) * Decent mix of national chains (Apple, Sharper Image) and locally-owned stores (Haus, Retail Laboratory) * Cool, over-priced wine cafe * Very dog friendly - they even have a bakery for your pampered Fido  CONS * Outdoor set-up (which can lead to sweaty, sticky summer shopping) * Hip 1960s modern architecture (which makes it look old compared to other malls.  The remodel last year botched what looked fine already IMO.) * Small scale of the mall (which means that it lacks many stores you would find elsewhere) * Demographics of the immediate area (which means it doesn't have much if you don't make $100K or have a trust fund)

Urban hipsters, truckers, tiki lovers, and homos rejoice - you have your place, Bikini Lounge.  Is it bad that I love Bikini, but that the drinks suck and are totally weak - or are they strong - and am I just becoming more of an alky?  Don't answer.  That is neither here nor there.    I've noticed the weak drinks the past several times have gone, and was hoping it was a phase, but no - it looks like a pattern, folks.  Be warned. Or one option could be to just forgo the liquor and go with cheap pitchers of PBR.  However, the atmosphere, jukebox selection, diverse crowd, and "Phoenix institution" status are enough to warrant a 5 star rating, but the weak drinks are a drag.

Every now and then I like to get my Brokeback Mountain on, and Charlie's gives me my fix.  It's honestly more of an urban cowboy experience with tons of no-attitude gay locals (of all scenes and persuasions) and a smattering of REAL cowboys.  This is def. a gay Phoenix must-do when out-of-towners visit.   The real cowboys tend to go during the week, but Thursday - Sunday nights bring out the weekend warriors and its largest crowds of the week.  That's when they open the other 3 service bars as it soon becomes after-hours central.    My favorite day is Thursdays when they do TWO-for-ONE drinks.  During the week at 7 PM they offer FREE (did you hear that?  FREE!) dance lessons -- line dancing and two-step.   Sunday afternoons bring out the sand volleyball players in their back patio, and really BAD Pussy LeHoot drag shows (they're almost so bad that they're good, if that makes any sense).   The restrooms are MUCH nicer since the remodel / expansion.  The rest of Charlie's is really DUMPY inside, but I LOVE it.   The crowd here is much more down-to-earth that other gay bars, and is more of a destination bar than the rest - attracting people from the suburbs.

The average age of patrons at Mary Coyle is probably 63, but it's all good.  I LOVE old people.  Shoot my parents are old, my grandparents were old, and someday I will be too!  I mean, if anything, it should be a badge of honor for any ice cream parlor.  Old people KNOW old-fashioned ice cream parlors, right?  No fooling them huh?  The ice cream here is ROCKIN!  I mean 16 percent butterfat  and made fresh on the premises daily?  How can that not be simultaneously sinful, decadent and to-die-for?  Mary Coyle was just what the doctor ordered when I returned from a 2 hour workout at the gym.  Haaah!    I decided to keep it sensible and choose a "Showboat "(pippen - which is a small), but couldn't decide between one of the specialities with hot fudge or caramel.   Luckily the Turtle and the Hare featured both - glazed atop scoops of fresh butter pecan ice cream.  Service by the high-schooler staff was OK.  The vertical striped (pink/white) wallpaper and Norman Rockwell prints were so hokey and authentic I wanted to gag and laugh at the same time.  Minuses:  The 1950s feel here is authentic, but how can an old fashioned parlor not have a bar, and row of barstools?  (Come on... Sugar Bowl has a bar!) Also,  they substituted pecans for peanuts on my ice cream.  It's OK.  It happens.  But I overheard at tables next to me that they ran out of marshmallows too.  OK, I'm no expert here, but those are ingredients that are readily available at your neighborhood Fry's.  Too much of a coincidence, and almost borderline lazy to not run out and replace immediately.  Disclosure:  I must have been under the influence, because I am nearly always a gelato-ONLY fool.  But for some reason I wanted full-fat ice cream.

Went here on Monday (actually next door at Bruno Mali's) for the hip hop night, and it was sick.  About 50 or so people in the smallish space. Cheap drinks, edgy urban art sale (lot of Che paintings), early 90s hip hop (think A Tribe Called Quest) , freestyling, and an eclectic crowd sum it up here.  Check out the cute blondie mastering the turntables....damn!

This dark moody bar has more character in a square inch than FIVE Scottsdale bars have altogether.  Quite simply stated -- they just don't make bars like this anymore.  Chez Nous oozes bar noir cool - with the patterned neo-gothic wallpaper, 70s light fixtures, plush leather booths, and a weathered old-school sensibility.  I don't know why I haven't reviewed this yet either - having been several times.  A small group of us bid farewell this past weekend to the 7th Ave/Indian School charmer of a bar that was Chez Nous.  I'm gonna go out on a limb here, but in my several trips here I've found this to be the most ethnically diverse crowd one can find at an Arizona bar -- all mingling, drinking stiff drinks and dancing to 70s funk and soul in harmony (cue cheesy sappy music here).  I hope the character of this bar and mix of regulars stays intact - something I worry about since it's moving to the gentrifying Roosevelt arts district in August.

Hands down, this is my favorite bowling alley in Phoenix.  Talk about character, this spaceship-looking place is down with the 50s Googie architecture with the pointy eaves jutting diagonally into the sky.  I've been here many a Sunday nights for the cheap bowling, and have always had a blast.  The plastic seating booths here are the best part - curvy with enough seats for everyone.  The bar is pretty big here too, with pool tables if you're bored of bowling.   I've never eaten here, just drank - so not sure on the food.  But the pizza sounds good....

Although it sounds like a wack-job fly-by-night TV warehouse just from the name, don't be fooled nor should you underestimate the impressiveness of this grub-haven on 15th Ave. Last weekend my friend and I had an intense craving for Greek that neither Pita Jungle nor other places could handle.    We realized that this place Crazy Jim's might be up to the task.  I had been told multiple times by friends who work in Central Phoenix about this place (another location on Washington is bonus), only to find myself busy, wanting something else, blah, blah, blah.  The freshly made gyro feta pita was heavenly. The pita was fluffy, the gyro strips were tender and flavorful and the feta cheese and tzatziki dressing were the icing on this cake, so to speak.  The accompanying steak fries are thick and crispy. Bobo opted for the spicy beef pita and was lovin it.  The environs are rough around the edges, but this low-key and spartan cafe delivers, amid the sound of local radio piped in via loud speaker.  The focus here is on the food and nothing else.  The servers were prompt, friendly and chatty, but not too much.  The menu is rife with tantalizing options including pita pizzas, pastas, subs and burgers, but I've never desired to stray from the solid and delicious pitas.

It's a bit of a hassle getting into the restaurant's parking lot these days from light rail construction.  But that's probably just as well.  I'm not in a hurry to get back to Pho Bang -- so no biggie.  Some respectable ethnic eateries aren't much of a looker when it comes to decor.  No surprise there.  But Pho Bang takes shabby and RUNS with it.  The floors are worn, and so are the classroom-like ceiling tiles.    When I walked in there was no greeter, or anyone around to direct you to a table.  I later see that two little old ladies were running the ship in what became clear was a family operation.  Since I wasn't sure about seating protocol I walked to the back counter where it looked like one woman was counting the cash register (it was only 7 pm).   She looked at me all confused and flustered.    It wasn't that busy either.  Two tables in particular were messy upon my arrival - and were for another 20 minutes after that.   I was finally sat at a table near their Best of Phoenix awards - all four of them.... from the late 90s!   Figuring that many Vietnamese places have popped up in recent years to make it more competitive - I didn't think much of it.  I noticed on the menu that Pho Bang is a chain with locations in Manhattan, Dallas and Houston - who knew?    I place my order of shrimp summer rolls and pork and veggie vermicelli noodle bowl and assess the scene - 3 tables at about 6 -10 mostly Asian and Hispanic people (some family, and some friends) each dining and laughing.   To make the atmosphere even more sketchy than when I arrived,  I notice this grey moving cart that was wheeled from table to table.  Servers here don't clear the table and take the mess to the kitchen - they just dump it in a cart and wheel it all over the restaurant until closing.  Nice, unsavory, and klassy.  My food arrives and the summer roll and dipping sauce tasted alright.  The roll was heavy on the mint leaves, but otherwise it was OK.  The noodle bowl was OK too.  Nothing to write home about.  The one I've had at a Vietnamese place in Chandler was much more flavorful.  I'm not a soup person so I'm not sure how the pho is.  So, there you have it.  An average food experience coupled with unsavory ambiance and so-so service.

It's hard to not feel like a wino at Sun Devil Liquors.  But it's hard for me to not feel like a wino wherever I am. I digress.   It's not quite like drinking at Sportsmen's, where you feel like it's a wine bar posing as a wine store.  Sun Devil feels more like a liquor store trying to be a liquor store, and oh yeah, we have a cozy little wine bar and outstanding wine selection downstairs.  Don't get me wrong.  I dig it. It's just different from all your typical wine bar/liquor stores...if there is a typical one.  Bonnie and I rolled up on a recent Friday night.  At 10 pm, it was just us, another couple, the bartender and another couple who arrived when we left. After walking around this wine cellar (complete with a bar and two cocktail tables) and spotting a few very impressive California bottles including: Caymus, Cakebread and Silver Oak - (which are out of my league at this moment) we bellied up to the corner bar and had a couple of beers.  I had some Salvadorean lager, which was very good and worth the chump change ($1.50).    We entertained ourselves with the usual:  witty banter,  stream-of-consciousness blather,  interpretive dance,  complimentary Dove chocolate morsels and a  horseshoe wrought iron puzzle.    That's how we roll.   This is a perfect place if you want quiet, low-key conversation in Mesa...but it might be a forgettable place if this were in a different part of Scottsdale or Phoenix.

If you can disregard the overblown gross thoughts that come with the revelry of hundreds of drunken fools in a public waterway, you can be assured of a good time minus the standard sunburn you're certain to receive. Apply sunblock and reapply every hour! That can't be stressed enough.  Salt River Tubing surpassed my expectations in terms of customer service and comfort. Given the sheer volume of customers as we arrived, things moved pretty quickly, from waiting in line for our tubes or waiting to board the antiquated bus. $15 buys you an intertube rental and roundtrip bus ride to/from your riverside entry/exit. But if you can supply your own tubes and/or rides, it's free, or $12 for the roundtrip bus ride. Lucky for us it was Pirate Day and our bus driver was an absolute riot, taking the corners extremely fast and mumbling at his parrot. Additionally, we got to gawk at all the pirate themed groups of people as they floated past. Tubing veterans are apparent with their inflatable rafts, blow-up swimming pools and waterproof sound systems. THAT is the way to do it folks.  Be prepared to be pelted by marshmallows from fellow floaters and to see other assorted garbage floating about. Protect your feet by wearing shoes -- raggedy old shoes will do. You can never have enough food/drink/water, and If in doubt, bring more.

One of the more hip breakfast places around, The Breakfast Club can get crowded on weekends with a sceney bunch.  They have great eggs benedicts - about 5 different types one of which comes with steak instead of ham.    Always had a decent experience here, until recently when the Scottsdale blondie server gal was aloof the entire time and tried to stiff us on the tip.  The bill was $32, we gave her $40 and she tried to avoid coming back to face us - as if we'd leave.  Coincidentally she was within sight in the kitchen flirting with a guy server - giving him some back-scratching action.  We finally caught a busser to flag her down.  NO WAY SISTA...The customer decides what your tip should be - not YOU.  Not going back.

It tries, but at the end of the day 944 magazine is basically an Old Town Scottsdale party picture rag (usually featuring the Dirty Scottsdale crowd) written at the 8th grade level.    Don't believe me?  Flip to the back and see the last 30 pages or so.  Multiply by the number of cosmetic surgery ads and bar/club ads and you've got a lofty quotient.  The party pics are usually why people check it out.  Kind of like when married men say they read Playboy for the articles.  RIIIGGHHT!!  They are starting to cover Phoenix and Tempe a bit more than in the past, but it's primarily a Scottsdale 20-something society/nightlife magazine.  Plus if you want to see a magazine clown and insult its unsuspecting and not-so-bright readers, check out the Letters to the Editor.  I mean, wow.  btw, 944 is named for its old address when its offices were located on Mill Ave.

Delicious breakfast food and great space really make this place.  The long wait this time was disappointing (spring training and St. Patty's day the day before probably exacerbated the wait), but the wait for the food is still worth it.   A long wait for the food once we were seated, but chatting with good peeps I didn't even really notice.  That's the only minus to this place, really.  The food is very good.  I brought two newcomers here today who were impressed with the food.  They had veggie omelets and buttermilk pancakes.  Aren't they good Bonnie?  I ordered the egg bagel sandwich with applewood smoked ham (actually it was on sourdough because they ran out of bagel.  Lame but forgiven because they were very busy and it was still freaking good).  The ham is premium stuff and about 1/4" thick.  Other times I have had the garlic mushroom omelet with (and they accomodated my request for brie and ham) in a sherry mushroom cream sauce - it was absolutely heavenly.  The eclectic furniture, bold colors of the interior and artwork for sale are noteworthy - but artwork for sale in the crapper?  Kinda gross...

Ditto to what the others said.  Cheap fun place with a great happy hour, and PBR special.  I swear this place must have acquired my grandma's old couch somehow.  Look for the tan couch with the wood paneling and rose pattern....yep, that would be it.

My mouth is watering just thinking of the fluffy floured freshly made tortillas.  The tortillas along with their cilantro butter are nothing short of amazing. And they should be.  I mean, it IS called the Old Town Tortilla Factory, so they had better be delicious.    Other than that and the expansive twinkle-lit patio, there's nothing to really write home about here.  I found myself here twice in the past week so I was able to enjoy some great patio dining.  It seems like every Mexican/ Southwestern restaurant says they have the best margarita in Arizona.  OTTF makes that claim on the back side of their menu, along with a litany of other awards mostly from Citysearch.  City what?  City who?  The award-winning Treasure margarita looked impressive and robust presented with the shaker - providing an extra drink or so.  The taste was not anything out of this world like I expected.  The patio is really huge and makes up probably 70 percent of all the seating in the establishment abutting the quaint historic adobe home - meaning fall and spring are definitely the times to go here.  But the green plastic chairs - gahh!  A charming and impressive patio is diminished by the cheap picnic ambiance the chairs emit.  The food is ok.  The first time I had the Poblano de Mariscos -- stuffed poblano peppers filled with crab, cream cheese, herbed butter, roasted corn, diced red bell peppers with a shrimp cream sauce. The reality?  Stuffed peppers with mostly cream cheese and a smattering of crab flakes.  I couldn't even taste the crab.  The second time I ordered the tortilla soup and it wasn't all that great either.  It was more red than orange and had more chicken and not enough tortilla than I have had elsewhere.  It's ok if that the way you like it, but I will pass.    The salsa was the worst though.  Mostly a red tomato sauce with bit of chile included.  It was the most mild and un-spicy salsa I have EVER had in my life.  I think Pace mild sauce is hotter than this stuff. Since I was with my friend Maya and a friend visiting from Queens, I was shouting "New York City?!" - mocking the old Pace commercials.  Maybe they accidentally served us Ragu.  Who knows? All was fine once we asked for habanero sauce to spice it up.   2.5 stars overall. 5 stars for the tortillas.

Furio is just right in so many ways. White leather lounge sofas and the bold sexy decor set the mood and suggest an air of pretension, but the friendly service and basketball game on TV balance that with an air of a laidback sensibility.  The lounge area was neither too quiet nor too loud, neither too quiet nor too dark.  I'm diggin on you Furio!  Fancy martini and cocktail list are the name of the game here and prices are about average for the Old Town scene - think $10-12 martinis.  I opted for a Bacardi and Coke since all the cocktails sounded so sweet.  On a Thursday night with the Yelp crew there were about a dozen or so inside at about 10 pm when the dining area was shutting down.    I imagine this as somewhere to chill and gather to pre-party before heading out to the dance clubs. But I (and probably you too) would be just as fine relaxing the night away here. I would go here more often if it was closer to me, and I would be up for having dinner here sometime for sure.   It's actually more like 4.5 stars, but I'm reserving judgment until I dine there.

This is the best place to go for an authentic 1950s ice cream parlour experience.  Try the Camelback soda or a super soda to feel really Leave It To Beaver-ish.   Sit at the stools at the bar for an extra authentic feel.  Pay for your tab at the cashier booth for a real blast from the past.  Don't expect to order anything healthy at Sugar Bowl, or attempt to stick to your diet.  It's ALL BAD for you, and I LOVE it.  I got my ice cream soda with EXTRA HOT FUDGE lining, and I loved it.  Who else LOVED it, you ask??  24 HOUR FITNESS, baby!!  I'm hauling my calorie-laden ass over there every day for the next week.  It's all good.  It's worth it.  Who the eff cares if the ice cream could be fresher?  The food here is probably average, but the experience and ambiance bump it up an extra star.   P.S.  This is very reminiscent of Farrells for the SoCal peeps out there.

This has to be my favorite guilty pleasure on Thursday nights.  For a while there I was addicted - even memorizing some of Dennis Rowland's jazz covers!    Luckily, I got a life, and hadn't been in a while.  But I found myself here last week showing off this place to an out-of-town visitor, and was sorry I had even left.  Kazimierz is a quintessential Phoenix experience, not because it's typical Phoenix -- but because it shows how magical a great space, a great wine list (1800 bottles deep), an entertaining performer, and an interesting mix of guests can do for a bar.  Regarding the rest:  * Everyone else accurately describes the set-up.   * I've never had the food here as I'm always here post-dinner.   * The service here is always professional and above par.   * And the jazz entertainment on Thursdays ($5 cover) is always a crowd pleaser.    Speaking of the crowd it ranges the gamut in age, ethnicity and types -- from guys/girls night out (on their way to Suede), couples canoodling on a dinner date, to older couples there for the music.  My only complaint as another reviewer points out is the tacky wine menu - in a three ring binder?!?   It's quite the disconnect.  Why not go one step further and put the wine selection in a.... Trapper Keeper.  Klassy!  If you get a chance check this bar out in July for the Christmas tree and candy canes.  Ho ho ho, winos!

Celebrating your 50th birthday here is ill-advised if you have a heart condition or are not ok with the randomness of the Grapevine and its Saturday night karaoke crowd.  All the sudden I look up from the birthday friend being serenaded on stage to "Like a Virgin" when some meathead (rumor has it he's a stripper) starts dry humping said friend lifting her up chair and all.   * Good times.   * Immense song list. * Slow drink service. * Kick ass bongo drums. * Slow karaoke service.  Took me about 90 minutes to wait for first song. (Bob Marley - Is This Love)   * Too many drunken "Sweet Carolines" and "Black Velvets".  Let's be original, people. * And, yes, it seems that many of the clued in regulars get to sing more often.  * Here's a tip.  I saw the same guy sing as Joe, Joseph and Jose.  If you can't beat em?  Join em.

This museum is a great fixture in the Southwest arts scene.  A little on the small side, but hey, can you believe this museum wasn't founded until 1999?!  With that said, it's a wittle baby in museum-years.  Considering most of the biggie modern art museums came into age in the 1930s and 1940s, this stark temple to modern art is quite a bold statement for our young state.   Exhibits are edgy and provocative.  In the past year they had a Warhol retrospective, a Mayan-inspired art deconstruction, and a photo exhibit on illegal immigration.   Thumbs up to the gift shop.  RAD chotchkie alert - kitschy and unique coffee table books, architecture and pop culture finds abound here.  I even got a friend some weiner dog salt/pepper shakers here!!  PS - SMoCA Nights is a quarterly, kick-ass see and be seen event with pretty people galore, fashion, local artists, DJs, food, drink and art.   Kind of like a compressed First Friday but with more of a clubby feel.

I'm still waiting to contract salmonella or bird flu from the warmed over, heat-lamp-lit, community-sized tubs o' food.  Fortunately that has not happened yet.  All I could think about during my running race were dancing sausages and galloping bacon strips greeting me at the finish line.  So of course that prompted me to desire unlimited amounts of each, which led us to Hometown Buffet.  I wanted classy, so we went to the Hometown Buffet in Scottsdale.  I dragged my friends here kicking and screaming.  The pancakes were disgusting and bland.  Didn't have the French toast but it was visibly crusty and overcooked.  Hash browns were ok.  Orange juice was the worst watered down crap I have ever had.  The eggs?  I wouldn't even think of it.   The crowd and decor?  Just what you would think.  Large and in charge baby.  And old too.  Our weights and ages combined were about 200 pound lighter and 20 years younger than any other party there.  With all due respect, our sweaty, race-weary table probably smelled the worst.  I knew what I was getting into, but I wanted unlimited bacon and sausage - which along with the fried chicken were good, btw. And there you have it.

2.5 stars. I think I was most turned off by the crappy service at Rogue on a recent Saturday night for William F Reed's Shake dance night.  Whether they were understaffed or what, I don't know.  But the wait for a drink at the dark dank bar was at least 20 minutes.   I spied Mike's pitcher from a few minutes earlier and thought that would be a better deal since it took so freaking long to even get the attention of the bartender.  The bartender chick snapped at me and screamed "No more pitchers!" when she had just served one a few minutes earlier, so I had to settle for carrying around a bunch of PBR cans like an effing high schooler.  Shoot, if I knew I would be lugging beers in my pockets I would have made alternate plans.  I'm not above bringin a flask.   The crowd is kind of all over the place, like Glam and Homme, except here it skews more indie punk rock or wannabe indie punk rock. I love me some divey bar, so I was looking forward to a decent time at Rogue.  That bar experience left a bad taste in my mouth.  Cheap ass drinks couldn't make up for it. I might be back, but I'm in no hurry.  The bar itself is dark and dirty (bathrooms vie for the sickest in town, parking lot vies for smallest in town), and I'm ok with that, but with the crappy bar service, what would the saving grace be?  The people and the music.  Seeing a dozen or so friends (including Bonnie and Michael) randomly converge on this place after a concert rocked in my book.  And top that with everyone screaming and dancing to "Your Love" by Outfield.  And that's worth at least two stars right there.

I almost did backflips when Human Resources told me that my health insurance covered Mayo Clinic.  HR - So do you want to select the option for Mayo Clinic?  it's standard with your HMO.  Me - Um, let me think about it for a while.....uh, YES!?!?!  Do you even need to ask? HR - Most people choose not to because it's so far. Me - Well I don't care, I think my health is worth the drive.  So there ya have it.  Shazam.  I have been seeing my primary care physician and some specialists there for nearly two years now.  Yes, it's damn near in Fountain Hills - about 40 minutes from home and about a 1 hour drive from work.  I'm certain I must drive past five thousand other doctors on my way to Mayo Clinic.  But this shit is worth the drive.    I love my doctors here.   I love the courteous customer service and professional bedside manner.   I love the promptness of the clinic.    I love the easy to read/understand patient handouts/brochures.   I love the gorgeous selection of kachinas on display in the lobby.   I love walking past and sighing at the piano player's music.   I love that they have good magazines to read and not shitty ones.   I love feeling like the youngest person in the world here.   I love the beautiful desert landscaped campus and architecture.   I even love the curly-cue ramps going into the underground parking structure.  But best of all I love that I pay $5 to be treated by one of the highest-rated hospitals/clinics in the nation.  I heart you Mayo Clinic... let's get married.

Ahh, one of my favorite Arizona museums - and a must-do when tourists ask me where to go.  And a DEFINITE must for art, history or architecture buffs.  While it is rather expensive -- upward of the $20 figure charged by NYC museums, it is worthy enough to charge as such.   Can be very crowded in Winter and Spring.   The 60 minute version is the most popular I gather, but the office staff will always try to upsell you on the 90 minute version.  Whether you should go for the plunge is up to you.  The main difference being that you get to see his and his wife's living room and private living quarters.   Having been on both tours - it's a toss up on which to recommend.  The tour itself is given by well-informed and professional docents (one upside of the hefty admission).  That in itself is almost unheard of in the museum world where they have gone mostly to audio rentals.  Stunning views of Scottsdale and a nice piece of Sonoran foothill landscape to be had here.

I first happened upon this store when I complimented this guy's shirt a while back at Shady's.  It was a SWEET white Guatemalan tunic with turquoise accents.   The guy looked at me funny,  told me he got it at Yucatecan Imports.  Knowing that he got it from some obscure place - and that the chances of someone else having that same shirt would be very slim (only him) -- that's all it took for me to be sold on this place.  Note:  In case you're wondering where Yucateca is -- it's right between Canadia and Dumbassia.  I was there THAT weekend, seeking out the store - tucked all incognito-like in the Mill Avenue Shops spanish-style courtyard.  Of course, that tunic was NOWHERE to be found.  That would be too perfect, right?    But I found a really cool specialty Latin import store in the process with a bunch of goodies for the seasoned ethnic collector.  Most everything is hand-woven: wallets, clothing, necklaces, bags, etc.  And nearly everything is from Mexico, Central and South America - with some items from Thailand, Tibet, India and Turkey.  The owner is a serious importer and a friendly guy too.   I don't find this store as comprehensive as my other favorite import store - Suenos on 7th St., but I find it very worthy nevertheless.

I don't think Harlow's Cafe is a four star place, but I definitely would give it 3.5 stars.  It's your typical old-fashioned greasy spoon coffee shop with burgundy 1970s style naugahyde booths, movie posters and old photos, but heavy on your typical ASU/Tempe crowd.  Harlow's makes you ask yourself the following questions.  Is Burt Reynolds here? How clogged are my arteries getting right now? Why can't more breakfast places have this dated look?  The food and service were pretty good.  Our waitress hopped to it when we said we were in a hurry.   I ordered a breakfast burrito with ham eggs cheese (and a surprisingly spicy salsa) and minced hash browns and gobbled it up before you could say "Dukes of Hazzard".   Personally, I prefer my hash browns without all the extras.  I tried a bit of my brunch date's chorizo egg scramble, and it was a respectable effort of something I'm usually very critical of.  If you can, check it out on a weekday, go to the bathroom at home (unless you dig that cramped feeling).  I echo other comments on the priceyness of the entrees.  It's not a place I would go out of my way for, but it's worth a stop if you live nearby or are in Tempe.

Quite often, KJZZ weeknight broadcasts are my escape from reality when I want to just kick back and relax.  With playlists inclusive of Miles, Dinah, Terence, Duke, Ella and Coltrane - this jazz is the real deal.  It's not my most favorite public radio station (that honor would go to KCRW in California), it could stand to grow some dimensions and diversify its music programming.  Regardless, I still love KJZZ and have listened to more Morning Edition, Diane Rehm, All Things Considered, This American Life and Whaddaya Know than you probably care to know.    I have also heard KJZZ jazz broadcasts also come in handy if you're looking to get lucky.

Easily Dilly's Deli is my sandwich shop of choice in Tempe.  I think I must luck out when it comes to the weekday ASU/Downtown Tempe crowds, because I never have had much of a wait here.    The sandwiches here are superior: Boar's Head meats and thick luscious sliced bread made from scratch.  I never go wrong with the dark brown cracked wheat.  My usual order here is the Southwestern club (turkey, bacon, avocado, pepper jack cheese, red onions and raspberry honey mustard), although the Smokey Mountain and Buffalo Chicken are tasty as well.  The Southwestern club is comparable to the Turkey Chipotle wrap from Paradise Bakery if you're into that.  Now that it's cooling down, I'll be up for the bread bowl soup thang so I'll def. update you all on the soup.  Dilly's is more pricey than your typical sandwich place, but worth it I think.  Lunch with a soda ran me 9 bucks.

Iconic Frank Lloyd Wright architecture and high-quality event programming combine to make ASU's Gammage Auditorium a cultural gem and a highlight for the arts in Arizona.  Besides being a stop for the 2004 U.S. Presidential Debates, it's probably most well known for its role as the primary stop in Phoenix for Broadway plays and musicals.  I last attended Les Miserables, one of a number of "Broadway Across America" shows that stops in town.  Even though we sat up in the second level, the sight lines were not that bad, seats were ok and the circular interior and winding staircases were fun to wander around.   This building was originally commissioned in the 1950s to be an opera house in Baghdad, but for whatever reason ASU lucked out and scored this design for Gammage.  It's now one of the most recognizable buildings on campus.

Every week or so I get a mad craving for chicken salad on greens with their crab curry pasta.  The chicken salad is decent and perfectly balanced with the right mix of mayo, shredded chicken, and sliced grapes.    The crab curry pasta is delicious and addictive, but could seriously use some crab. While In Season Deli is a solid staple in my lunchtime diet - the past few times I have noticed the dwindling amount of crab in the pasta.  My lunch buddy Joe and I were debating the better name to describe this dish -- curry pasta with crab extract or curry pasta with essence of crab?  You decide for yourself.   The woman behind the counter (who I think is the owner) is always friendly, chatty and personable - which is always and added bonus.  Pay at the counter, grab a seat outside, eat your lunch on the patio and enjoy the tranquil and quiet brick courtyard - added bonus number two.  Four stars - possibly five if they get the crab situation in order.  Ok, that just sounded gross.

Java is the 944 for the hipsters and wannabe hipsters of Central Phoenix.  Dig it?  Maybe, maybe not.  Depends on the issue, the coverage and how many times I have to see the same DJs, artists, advertisers and the same lanky disheveled stoic Downtowners profiled.  Other times I have found a perfect new gallery to fall in love with or read about the newest wine bar opening up the street.    Love it or not it this free monthly rag does a better job of covering Central Phoenix, Tempe and other hipster pockets than -- oh wait, zero, zilch, zippo.    Yes, no one else is covering it.

I'm admittedly not a soup fan (except for Paradise Bakery's fire roasted tomato, but I digress).  So I have no intention of ordering pho when I'm out eating Vietnamese.  With that out of the way, I've had the vermicelli noodle bowls here at Pho Nhat, and of the five Vietnamese places I frequent in the Valley - the portions here are HUGE.  I'm not talking just generous, but freaking HUGE, and a steal at $5 each.   The bowls they serve this in must be 4 inches deep and 12 inches in diameter.  You can order these bowls in your standard combinations - I usually order barbecue beef and grilled shrimp.  They also go an extra step and throw in an egg roll.  The digs here are pretty modest, but right in line with most Vietnamese places.  Try not to stare at the post-post-modern art of Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck on the wall - apparently it was painted for the owner's toddler.

Dos Gringos is definitely bringing trashy back.  And I think the whole trailer park theme has really gotten the best of them.  Two cases in point.  A) Drinks are EXTREMELY weak.  They give you tall glasses, but have very thin pours of liquor.  Thinking maybe it was the vodka, we switched to rum, but alas, the trailer park was just being cheap.   B) The vomit stench wafting from the mens restroom really takes the trailer park theme a little too far, right?  After I reported to staff that puke was all over a men's urinal, it was still there an hour later.  Doesn't that make you yearn for the good old college days??  Granted it was a Sunday afternoon and all, and the DJ and crowd was fun.  A definite fun place to day drink, and bring the pooch.  Call me an old-fashioned prude, but the puke-fest and sucky drinks kind of killed the mood.  And believe it or not, I didn't have the appetite to try any of their award-winning tacos.

Like rapper Ice-T says "Don't hate the playa, hate the game."  Well that eloquence pretty much sums up my feeling on Caffe Boa and their dynamite happy hour deals.  It's a great day when you can meet up with friends after work on Mill and load up on delectable appetizers, $2 pints and $3.50 glasses of bubbly cava without dodging frat guy chodes and chodettes.  Five of us gathered here the other day well before their 7 pm HH last call and made a meal out of it.  Final bill?  $12 each.  The appetizers here are delicious and well presented.  I'm a fan Boa's mix of Italian, Slavic and other influences.  It's a well done fusion that you don't find often here in Phoenix.    The Shrimp Adriatico appetizer is my favorite and was the crowd favorite at the table.  The wine tomato garlic reduction it comes in is so addictive and sometimes forces you ask for more bread to nosh on.  We also ordered the caprese platter, bruschetta and salsiccia -- sliced sausage in a zesty red tomato mushroom kalamata ragout.    My five stars are for their happy hour.  As a victim of their own success, making it on time and with a seat at Caffe Boa's happy hour requires some good organization, leaving work early and/or both.  Beyond the happy hour I find hearsay on dinner to be a toss-up, however, I've never done it so I can't say.

"Honey I Shrunk the Lunch Specials and the Restaurant, too!" is more apropos of a name for Thai Basil. Now don't get me wrong, I like Thai Basil.  The food is decent and the interior is nice, but the tables/diners seem to be squished elbow-to-elbow New York style. Spartan, but slightly upscale, this restaurant ALWAYS seems to have a wait.    The yellow curry here is my favorite with a delicious balance of coconut, spice, carrots chicken and potatoes.  I can't ever seem to get enough, and I really mean that.  The portions here are small, and while lunch portions are expectedly small, portions elsewhere (at Chanpen Thai, for example) are larger and less expensive. Elsewhere the Thai BBQ chicken comes with 1/2 a chicken, but at Thai Basil they give you three lonely strips like cheapos!  The massaman curry and pad thai are pretty good too, but I feel they're just OK.  I've had better.  Service is hit or miss here.  One thing that's consistent: they always seem to be understaffed. Once when I was dining alone (at a 4-person table) they had the nerve to ask me to move while in the middle of eating, to a 2-person table.   To me, Thai Basil is style over substance.  Not impressed.  Next.

I've only seen concerts here, but I can say that the facility is top-notch as far as arenas go.  The interior and exterior of the arena is attractive and there's def. more leg room than at US Airways Center, although you still have to stand up in your row to let people by.  Concession stands were fairly spread out and lines seemed to go quickly.  I went to see Madonna most recently - about a year ago, and the entry process couldn't have been more easy or more funny.  This old woman security guard told all people, "Please prepare to open all bags for inspection that includes all purses, bags, and man-bags."  Fortunately for me and you (and other self-respecting men), I've never been seen in public with a man-bag.

This review is for the lounge and karaoke - and by God the money I forked out that night singing and getting drunk was the best $10 I've spent in a long time.  Yep folks.  Cheap drinks, karaoke, and a strange mix of humanity made for some excellent entertainment.    The people-watching in here is priceless.  Someone at the next table screamed "Git er done" at the stage, and it wasn't even a country song.  We came here on a whim off a tip from the fabulous barfolk at the Wynn.  Definitely coming back.

My mom rocks. Besides being awesome on many different counts, she introduced Blueberry Hill to me. Now, she's not a foodie, but she knows good breakfast grub.   She's no urban adventurer either, so I was surprised to see that she left the Strip to find a new breakfast spot. One of the things I love and hate about Vegas are the plethora of eateries in your hotel, forcing you to stay in. But a favorite pastime of mine now is to venture from the Strip to find the local favorites.    I think I struck gold with Blueberry Hill. Everything, and I mean everything I've ever had here has been mouthwatering, hangover-curing, delicious.  Whether it's savory or sweet - it's ALL good here. I usually go for the Dealer's Special with a hamsteak and hash browns, but another good option is any number of the Mexican breakfasts with chorizo.  Even the breakfast burrito was impressive. Their signature blueberry pancakes do not disappoint either.  It's unassuming with its dumpy naughahyde booth diner look.  But that's why it's even more of a surprise find.  You can easily eat here for under $10.    Btw, there's a location just east of Maryland Parkway that's closer to the Strip.

Easily the best gay bar in Arizona for several reasons including: good drinks, friendly bartenders, pretty people, upscale decor/atmosphere and immense size.  It is comparable in feel to the Abbey in West Hollywood.  One of their claims to fame is their huge and inventive martini list.  So many places to hang out in depending on your mood - several outdoor patios, a beach (basically just has a surfboard) bar, Miami dance club, and the main bar area with a huge carved cherrywood bar, plush leather sofas and giant Roman pillars.  This mega-bar suffers from an identity crisis, methinks.  The crowd can be really busy and annoying on weekends.  People here can be friendly, but there are definitely friendlier bars out there.  So with that said, I would encourage you to go with a group of friends. Monday nights are favored for their Martini/Manicure night,  Thursday has a drag show, and weekends have the normal busyness.   Amsterdam is definitely the most straight-friendly gay bar in Phoenix.  Depending on the night crowds can vary - but are usually comprised of gay men.  The next biggest crowd is straight women, with lesbians not far behind, and finally everyone else - incl., yes, straight men.  The bar tends to have more straight people on First Fridays.  Getting there is always a bit of a surprise so beware of the light-rail construction.  Over the past year it's not as busy due to the construction and the opening of Burn a few blocks away.  So now is a good time as any to check it out.  UPDATE - 5/07 The past few months I have been going here have been very DEAD.  Weird crowd and not really that fun.  But it's still a great bar - 5 stars.

This place is reminiscent of thin-crust Neapolitan pizza I've had in Italy - who would have thought?  The first time I came here a couple years back I accidentally sprinkled salt (thinking it was fresh mozzarella) all over my pizza.  Doh!  Please note - for you newbies.    I heard the owner farms his own ingredients on-site and make his own mozzarella daily.  I usually order the Wiseguy w/ fennel sausage.    Personally I don't mind the wait - which is much shorter on a Tuesday or Wednesday.  But anything less than 2 hours is almost unheard of, so be prepared.  This place is a destination restaurant and def brings out Phoenix's own Bridge and Tunnel crowd (West Valley, East Valley, Ahwatukee, oh my).  The adjacent bar is charming and has decent wines by the glass.  Most people either love it or are so over-hyped about this place, that they can't help but feel let down.  I fall into the former category, so check out Pizzeria Bianco.

I knew I would love this place on my first visit about three years ago.  They just don't make restaurants like this anymore.   Clubby rat pack atmosphere, comfy leather banquettes, red lighting and wallpaper, stiff martinis straight up, tuxedo clad servers, entrance through the back kitchen (just like old-school LA restaurants).  So much character, so much CLASS, and you haven't even gotten to the food or service yet!  It's pricey here, so it's usually a special occasion/I'm gonna get laid sorta restaurant.   I came here for happy hour recently, and it was then I realized I hadn't reviewed this or eaten here in a long time.  I usually order a steak (New York), but yes, the seafood is pretty good here too.  The servers are top notch, (great sale pitches) and professional in every way in my visits.    The martinis here are easily contenders for the best martinis in Phoenix.  The bread loaf with the garlic spread is a good munchie, but let me tell you all you need is two martinis to call yourself done, if you know what I mean.

Incredible Mexico City Mexican food (in, you guessed it, the steadily gentrifying barrio) - with absolutely no hint of regional Southwestern or Sonoran flavor, which typifies just about every other Mexican restaurant in town.  A neat non-descript building from the outside, but a wondrous surprise inside.   White tablecloths aside - it's the little touches that strike you:    * The Coca-Cola in old-school glass bottles ala Mexico.  * The Virgin Mary/Guadalaupe tall pillar candles at each table. * Friendly, professional and candid servers. * The french bread and tapenade. * Your tableside made guacamole which is hands down the most innovative and tasty guac I've had in a while.  And I consider myself a guacamole junkie.   I ordered the chicken enchiladas suiza, which were flavorful and tender covered in a terrific tomatillo crema.  Great choice, but next time I'm having what my friend ordered - the cochinita pibil.   It's slow roasted for 12 hours every day - and the pork just melts in your mouth.  They have a huge tequila list and a Mexican (who knew?) wine list that ain't bad either.  UPDATE - 1/25/07  The Chiles en Nogada (the poblano pepper stuffed with chicken, garlic, pecans, apples, pomegranate and apricot) blew me away!!

This would typically be a 3 star review, but it gets another star for the following:  * Great air conditioning * Arizona's only Neiman Marcus * Hilarious people watching * Great happy hour haunts in the basement * Everyone here has a better tan than I do    Scottsdale Fashion Square is large and in charge and is definitely a sprawling spectacle to see at least once.   There's no denying that it's a local institution -- even if the store mix is a bit too pricey and exclusive for some.

I'm surprised anyone would give the Venetian anything less than 4 stars, but we are all entitled to our own opinions.  I found the hotel and the rooms to be superior and probably among the most comfortable I have ever stayed in.  Even the sofa was luxe and comfy.  Some thoughts:  * Yes, it's expensive and over-the-top, and I normally wouldn't stay here while in Vegas, but hey, it's Vegas.   * Tao Beach and the pools are a blast. * I love how staff here addresses me as "Mister" and kisses my ass like nowhere else. * If you have a chance to take the hotel's limo out for a whirl and charge it to your room, I highly recommend it. * I wasn't impressed with the generic toiletries (what? no name brand stuff?).   I don't think I can add much to what's already been said other than to say I almost slipped and fell on the waxed and polished floors (which would have been biff number #2 of the weekend), so be careful.

You really have to see it to believe it.  The Double Down Saloon delivered and then some. It's definitely a must do when you need to de-tox from all the luxury douchebag overpriced ultra lounges and clubs of the Strip.  Not quite my favorite Las Vegas dive -- that honor would go to Ellis Island -- but still an admirable dump nevertheless.  I trust Bonnie G and Lauren V (Phoenix Yelpers) taste in places as if it's my own, so I dragged two of my friends from the Venetian after a few raspberry vodka red bulls in our suite.  One of the friends is kind of stuck up, so I knew we wouldn't stay long since it is the ultimate dive of dives.  But I knew it was still worth a drink or two.   Little did I know that it's location in the "Fruit Loop" gay bar district of Las Vegas revealed that I had in fact, passed by this fine establishment a dozen or so times.  The feel here is decidedly more raucous rock bar than indie bar  and the crowd was more rough around the edges than I had thought. But we (3 obviously gay men) didn't feel as awkward there as you would think.   3 ass juices (which tastes like a red headed slut, btw) and 3 Schlitz's later we were soaking up the scene.  A band was wrapping up it show and movin out as we marveled at the Ass Juice, bacon martinis and vomit insurance.  If only every city had a Double Down and accompanying self-deprecating bar culture, the world would be a better place.  And then it was off to the rest of the bars in the Fruit Loop.

My sister swears that she saw a cockroach strolling across her bedspread when we stayed here last.  I never saw it, so I cannot confirm nor deny the sighting.  But regardless, that's still pretty sick.  It happens to the best of hotels, and I am sure it's an isolated incident.  Now that I think about it, we should have complained. Oh well.  I like the central location of this places and its OG status as one of the oldest casinos on the Strip.  Go Flamingo!  The Flamingo habitat and the crab leg buffet are highlights.  Haven't stayed here in a while, but wouldn't mind it if I got a good deal.

My favorite burger in Arizona for two years running. I must frequent Delux at least once every other week or so.  The fancy burger bar concept, trendy digs, Camelback corridor locale and outdoor patio with misters means it's usually crowded and usually loud -beware. The service is always quick and dependable - and the food is top notch.  They have two types of burgers - but the Delux burger with angus beef, gruyere, bacon arugula and caramelized onions on baguette is soooo good.  Likewise on the caprese salad and the sweet potato fries.  Order extra of the aioli dipping sauce for your fries. OMG. I. LOVE. THIS. STUFF.  The chicken panini is just OK, but the mahi mahi sandwich and veggie panini are great.  Don't forget to wash it down with one of the many beers on tap - they must have about 40 or so including the beloved Anchor Steam.  Dinner for two will be about $40, but like everything else - you get what you pay for.  An Islands burger this aint! A few copycat concepts have popped up in Phoenix, but make no mistake - Delux is the best.

So Delux got too big and (like an evil twin) swallowed up the next storefront for this new "to-go" venture.  It's reminiscent of a smaller La Grande Orange, in that it's basically a glorified deli, but with all the trimmings - sandwiches, salads, sushi, bakery, plus all the regular Delux items are available as well.   About the food - think pre-made yuppie roast beef sandwiches ($7) with balsamic infused roasted red peppers or, what I had, the turkey sandwich with dijon mayo spread and cranberry relish.   The sushi is readymade as are the side salads (including a deliciously tangy southwest pasta salad) and are in a refrigerated grocery-style section along with Pom, Kemper sodas and overpriced waters such as Ty Nant, Blu and Voss.  The desserts are a welcome addition, but I thought the cupcakes (strawberry and red velvet among them) were too small for the $3 they were charging.  You're better off hoofing it to Tammie Coe or Karsh's for that price.  The cookies looked more reasonable and delicious -- the cranberry white chocolate chip had cranberry icing shavings on the top.  Yum.  There are only five or so seats in the joint, so be prepared to take it to go - as the name of the place suggests.  I guess they're upfront about that, right?

The reviews are all right-on.  The jade red chicken and carnitas with chinese fried rice and with black beans were really good.  And the savory snickerdoodle with every order is a sweet touch!  For first timers they walk you through the ordering process which can be a bit tricky with all of the particulars of filling out the sheet (sushi bar style, but with special letters and charts).    One less star for the dank and gross dining area (cool panda vaquero mural, btw), but other than that this place is solid.  Sorry, don't feel comfortable giving 5 stars to a place with dirty floors and sinking ceilings.   And for those curling their lips at the thought of combining the two cuisines, look at any Chinese restaurant in the area - it's most likely a Mexican cooking Chinese food anyways....

A little piece of Scottsdale hotel bar minus the attitude....Review of drinks only....  I find this to be one of the better bars in Central Phoenix.  Trendy space.  Cool red lighting.  Great, friendly service.  Good drinks.  Not much to complain about here.  They actually have a modest yet cool drink list, but not much to offer regarding gin.  Sorry, gin lovers...lol.  Drinks are generous.  Bonnie could probably fit her face in a martini glass.  A friend who works in north Phoenix routinely recommends his discerning colleagues stay at the Clarendon.  Distance is not an issue, apparently. Not familiar with the hotel rooms ...although I've looked at the model rooms and they look WAY Gen-X chic.  I've been here on other occasions - last time was more of a gay crowd, (Thursdays are ad agency industry night) but other times - NOT at all.  That's part of the egalitarian Central Phoenix culture.  Not much of a surprise if you frequent places in the neighborhood.  Cute patio for smoking.  Good to note, post May 1,2007.

The "petite" lobster corn dogs didn't live up to the hype, but I wasn't disappointed with Vino Lounge at Tapino.  They were just as described and while I can't whole-heartedly recommend them, they were quite the novelty and I'm happy I tried them.  Petite was an accurate description as well, and this might as well go for the other tapas on the 5-5-5 menu.  Presentation is paramount here, with the corndogs displayed upright on a fancy wooden tray and the chocolate debauchery dessert laid out across a large plate with precision.  Let's face it, their happy hour menu is a highlight here for sure and its availability on weekends is a major plus.  The cabana style patio beckons you with a South Beach Miami flavor, that is, if a King Kong IKEA showroom swallowed Ocean Drive.  Yep.  Those same white slipcover couches decorate the patio, which isn't a bad move considering the wine accidents to be had here.  Our server handled our large party very well, but early on the hostess/servers wouldn't let us move tables or seats together when there was clearly room and the ability to do so.    Like others have said, it's not a place to go if you're really hungry, but it's great if you're fine noshing on ambitious and creative appetizers such as duck confit tostadas or beef carpaccio with garlic aioli and fried capers.  The pomme frites were soggier than they should have been but the seasoning was right on.   The wine here was terrific.  I quaffed on a French syrah and sipped my friend's sauvignon blanc, and both were delicious selections for the measly $5.  The chocolate debauchery dessert is a must if you have the room to do it. Overall, Tapino is really a great wine bar and worth the drive to Scottsdale.  I am looking forward to the next visit.

Cibo's spek (smoked prosciutto, mozzarella and tomato) sandwich is one example of its deliciousness, but that's just the tip of the iceberg. Like seemingly every other decent restaurant downtown, it too, is in a historic house.  This review is for lunch only - which means the menu is limited to sandwiches, salad and dessert.  It ain't cheap, so expect to throw down $30 for two for lunch.  Lunchtime draws in the crowd - your downtown business and government drones. Patio seating would have meant a 15 min. wait, but since we were in a hurry my downtown drone buddy and I opted for an inside table.  The feel inside is a warm urban rustic.  The food was very good.  The pizza/panini bread used for the sandwiches is the standout here.  Freshly baked, warm and near perfect texture. I could have had a bread sandwich by itself and been just as satisfied.  I spotted an attractive fruit yogurt granola dish at a table next to me - turns out it's one of their side salads.  I highly recommend it.  Service was ok, but would have been better had I gotten my water when I asked for it upon ordering and not at the end of the meal after reminding the server.  An honest mistake.  No big deal.  Parking is lacking here.  With the exception of a tiny lot in the back, it's the streets, yo.  We ended up with a two block walk.  Not a big deal, but worth mentioning.  I would go back often for lunch if it was close to work. My chance for one of their pizza dinners is looking mighty good.

Fez is one of my favorite places in central Phoenix.  The vibe here is pseudo-industrial, hipster grill/lounge.  Prices here are reasonable, and although it strikes me as a more spacious, loungey attempt at Delux - I would stick to items other than burgers at Fez.     While the Tangier and Fez burgers are decent, they just don't compare to the other fancy burger bar.  The kisra and hummus are ok, but kind of a yawn.   The standout appetizer here is the chicken phyllo pakcet stuffed with a delicious mixture of chicken, feta, bell pepper and spinach baked in a flaky puff pastry.  The pomegranate chicken is tasty, but my favorite dish here by far is the inventive strawberry blueberry cashew salad -it's just a terrific explosion of different flavors.    Fez has an incredibly extensive martini list!  Try to approach the restaurant from 3rd St. if you're skittish on the Central Ave construction.

I remember hearing about this place from a friend of mine a couple of years ago, and I was like "Yeah, whatever dude."  But I stand corrected.  To echo the other comments, this is some awesome, no-frills thin crust New York style pizza with some great sauce.  It's located in the Bally's strip mall and like Jake said, it's similar to Pizza Heaven, which is great because i really enjoy that place.   The two-slice lunch special is such a STEAL too at $3.50 - it's even cheaper than Pizza Heaven.   The space inside is small and cramped (which is also really New York style too) seating area for maybe about a total of 6 people, so be prepared to take it to go or order delivery.    I've never had anything else here, but I'd be willing to try their subs since they serve Boar's Head meats.  And one of these days I'd even try their pastas and entrees.

Easily my favorite hotel lounge bar in Las Vegas.  Parasol is the type of place where I don't bat an eye at throwing down $15 for a fancy martini.  Even the dramatic entrance down on curving escalators lends itself well to the experience.  The on-the-hour-every-hour show here is a stunning, visually stimulating and never disappoints - and akin to a hallucination episode.  The doorwoman noted that the "Lake of Dreams" show has six shows that rotate, and luckily I have seen three of them.  Late in the evening you can expect to wait for a seat on the terrace, but the wait is worth it if you've never experienced the show before.  I agree with Brandon on the ambiance here.  Fancy, but understated with no hint of attitude.   The bartenders inside are friendly and tipped me off to the amazing and divey Ellis Island, and for that I am indebted to them.

Midwestern hipster breakfast of champions - that's how I would describe it in 5 words.    Good down-home breakfast, but not for weight watchers.   Bright orange formica counters and rooster orange juice glasses.  Love that the place is smaller than a shoebox.  It means you have wait ahead of you, but it keeps the breakfast experience a friendly intimate one.   The hog and chick is what I usually order. But most recently I've been ordering the sopressata salami scramble with provolone and the five spot breakfast sandwich.  The burger buns are a lackluster choice, but the grilled onions and thick peppercorn bacon slices more than make up for it.  The hash browns can be a bit greasy, but hey, that's what happens when you cook with butter.    Can be a wait on weekend, but worth it in central Phoenix, especially when the Good Egg and other places get old.

A 4 star pizza place in Phoenix?  About as common as swimming pools or sun tans, right??  Seriously, this is 4 stars for a couple of reasons.  *Food* Decent food.  Not incredibly innovative, but still more ambitious than the rest.   I especially like their sausage and caramelized onion pizza, or the pepperoni with crimini mushroom pizza.  Also, the wines by the glass are surprisingly well picked and easy on the wallet.  Make sure to try the spinach, pancetta and goat cheese salad.  It's really tasty.  I asked the staff what kind of dressing they used and they gave me a printed recipe.  Cool eh?  I am curious about the pasta and panini - haven't had them yet.  *Value* Can't be beat.  For what little you pay, you get the better end of the deal at Sauce.  For a while there, they were doing a $20 special for a 12 inch pizza, salad and two glasses of wine.   That, my friends is a steal, and why this place gets four stars.  P.S. I think this place can best be described as an atmosphere similar to Paradise Bakery or Pei Wei as someone said below.

Sadly enough, Rosie McCaffrey's is like my Cheers --- not because it's so great, but because I can walk there, they know what my drink is, I can get schnookered and follow the breadcrumbs back to my house.  Come to think of it though, there are people there who resemble Norm, Sam and Woody.  The crowd is all over the map depending on the day of week.  A friend of mine sardonically describes it as a straight version of Padlock --which if you know what that means then great.  But if not, it's better that way -- trust me.  Let's just say it can be a bit of a meet market.   Weekends are crowded and tend to attract a fun upper-20s, early-30s party-hearty crowd -- the Tempe crowd 7 years later, I suppose.  It attracts more of a mainstream crowd than say George and Dragon.   Bands perform on the weekends.  But to be honest I can't even tell you what kind of music or what they sing.  They have a lot of beers on tap (Harp, Guinness and such) and strong liquor pours.  Tom is a rockin bartender. Weekdays are more laidback with a steady happy hour clientele of alcoholics, business crowd, Central Phoenix locals, Irish expatriates and rugby people. The jukebox is OK, but there are better jukeboxes in the area.  The feel inside is your standard Irish chotchky clutter, but it feels like an actual old house with the whole upper level.    Oh yes, and the pub grub is pretty good.  The fish and chips here are deserving of their reputation.  Great batter. The hot wings are also a good choice -- lots of meat and tasty Harp-soaked sauce. Stay away from the club sandwich -- the bread is soggy and the American cheese kind of ruins it.   BTW, St. Patty's day is CRAZY here. Yeah there are Irish pubs everywhere, but this is the only Irish pub for miles around -- so the crowd here was huge and spilled into the parking lot.

Always have had a good experience at Zest, but it has been several months.  From the soothing urban comfort atmosphere, to the warm friendly servers to the expertly cooked food - give this place a try.  Items of note - eggplant cheesecake and shrimp goat cheese melt...I'm a sucker for anything with goat cheese, but was really impressed.  The salads tossed for you right at your table and served with cranberries orange and nuts are outstanding.  The citrus glazed chicken was outstanding as well.  The wine list was pretty comprehensive and had some of my favorites, incl. Cakebread....For dessert try the mocha cappucino creme - you won't regret it.

It's hard to wax poetic on Tammie Coe when everyone has already said what needs to be said.   The Ooey Gooey cupcakes are outstanding as are the stunningly designed fondant cakes (for a pretty penny).  But I will add that the sandwiches they serve during the day are delicious as are the slider they serve come First Friday nights.    What a concept...Produce easy-to-grab-and-go sliders ($2.50 each I think) for people walking down Roosevelt.  It's nice to see businesses react to consumer needs like that.   I tried the Cuban, which was ok, but it lacked the roasted pork that also goes in it.  It was still good, but not as tasty as the muffaleta.    This is my pick for food on a First Friday night.  Just order 2 -3 of these and continue walking to the galleries down the road.

Yes, folks.  This place pretty much rocks.   The best way to describe it is that it's like a really hip study lounge (from the Clue board game) without the books or the geeks, but with a bar, pool table and jukebox instead.    It attracts a Central & East Phoenix 20-30 something crowd who want a cool low-key place to go, but without the Scottsdale scene.  The layout of the place is little odd - but not too big, not too small.  Decent servers, generous mixed drinks, Stella on tap, movies in the background (Weird Science when I went last), killer jukebox and fun crowd really make this place.  Don't all run now, don't want it to get too crowded now...

I'm a big fan of Camelview.  Nowhere else in greater Phoenix will you find the indie art-house selection they have here.  I've seen many of my favorite films here over the last 3 years, almost by default because other cineplexes won't show them.  The average age of patrons here is about 53, but it doesn't stop me.   I just wear mahogany loafers sans-socks, pleated bermuda shorts and a Tommy Bahama shirt and I blend right in.  The get-up looks hot too.  The facility itself is rather small and dumpy compared to newer suburban joints, but I like it.  Closer restrooms and easier-to-access concessions owes itself to the smaller scale.  It's always pretty busy, but come Oscar season it can be a MADHOUSE.   4.5 stars.  But if there were a Laemmle's theater here, Camelview would have a serious run for its money.

One day when my jeans were fitting a little snug (I think it was a day after Cheesecake Factory) I waddled my fat ass to Soma Express. This place has taken healthy eating and made it delicious - how about that?  Let me caveat it by mentioning it's not for everyone.  But if you're on a diet or are into low-fat, low-calorie and veggie options Soma Express is your place.    Highlights * Service and restaurant set-up is counter style ala Pei Wei.   * The people who work here are REALLY nice - which is something you just don't see much of these days.    * Fat grams, carb counts and calories are PRINTED on the menu - (omg I think I'm in LOVE, what a socially responsible restaurant?) * Free wifi - (lots of yuppies working on laptops here)  I've had breakfast and lunch here and was pleased.  Omelet dishes are very healthy (think mixture of eggs and egg substitute) - mine was a sirloin steak and non-fat mozzarella cheese with cinnamon raisin toast, all with under 300 calories.  For lunch I've had their extra-lean and 99% lean turkey burgers served with baked French fries.  For those of you familiar with Topz in CA or Better Burger in NY - the taste is very similar, flavorful without the grease.  Soma is about as close as we get to those places for healthy burgers.  The menu had a number of veggie options (salads and burgers with tofu, eggplant, ahi tuna and salmon).  Prices are little more than one would expect ($8 for a burger), but I for one don't mind paying a little extra for healthy quality.

It all started with my Yelp t-shirt.  Yep, my fancy for American Apparel started when I sported the Yelp shirt.  Woot woot.   Yelp reprezentin!  Finally a comfy combed cotton shirt that fits me perfectly.  Their sizes run about one-half size small, but if you know that and aren't large, you should be fine. You'll see the grey shirt in one of my profile pics.    I haven't bought a whole ton of stuff here -- a thermal undershirt long sleeve and a sweatband.    People can deride this place as being overpriced and devoid of character, but hey, I'm not a fan of big logos and if you need a simple, well built basic or you need a certain color this can be your place.  Staff here has a certain hipster cooler-than-thou look to them, but I've always found them to be helpful, so who cares.  Oh yeah, the digs on Mill are pretty sweet.  They rehabbed an old First National Bank of Tempe building with the vault intact and everything.

An amazing little gelato upstart opened this Spring.  It's located right next door to La Grande - with a connecting door, no less.  The owners are a friendly Italian couple recently relocated from LA.  The gelato is made fresh every day - not with mixes like a few other places in town.  Check this place out before it's overrun by new converts!

Call me crazy, but I do not understand the appeal of Ikea. I think there are several reasons for that.  Perhaps it's because I like to buy furniture that...  A) Lasts more than a few months. B) Dare I say - is ALREADY ASSEMBLED!  C) Makes me look like I'm not in college anymore. D) Doesn't have weird names like Jorfdung and Engelgoop.  Granted, I get the concept of getting what you pay for, and the inconvenience of assembling your own furniture for the pleasure of lower prices.  Not that I am above shopping at Ikea, because I love me some cheap lamps, plates and wine glasses like the rest of them.  I mean, a wine glass for 75 cents that my drunk-ass friends are going to break anyways?  Not bad.  I just think there are better products out there.  I mean, is it really worth it to buy an ugly $25 particle board bookcase that's going to completely fall apart in 6 months, AND assemble it on top of that?   I have bought more attractive, higher-quality items at Target for just a little bit more.    And besides, who really wants to deal with the clusterf*ck labyrinth, and screaming kid (more like banshee) headache that is Ikea, anyways?

Chanpen is one of a number Thai places up near Thunderbird and ASU West - but it is by far the best.  I frequent this place for lunch and it is always busy with a steady stream of locals, Glendale cops, students and professors.  Lunch specials are dirt cheap and range from $5-$7.  The service is decent, and the food - well the pad thai and chicken curry are flavorful and delicious.  Beware, the decor and booths are a bit dated, but remember you're there for the food. It's a bit of a hike for most, but definitely worth the trip.

My second-favorite pizza (close-second, mind you) in Phoenix.  Great atmosphere, always crowded, and always delicious pizza and salads.  I used to love their Pacifico pizza with shrimp, chorizo and goat cheese....mmmmmmm - but regrettably it's not on their menu anymore.  The sangria here is not bad either.  Very friendly and attentive hosts & servers, and casual yet fun decor.

Small-as-a-shoebox tapas place about 1 year new, Lola is a nice distinctive treat in central Phoenix.  Look for the golden sign and 1960s Mercedes parked out front.  You're greeted immediately by a friendly hostess, several communal tables, and really rad 70s Iberian light fixtures.   I dined here a while back and munched on a Spanish tortilla (a frittata-like dish), serrano ham, gazpacho and a glass of Malbec.  It's been a while so I can't review too confidently, but highly encourage a visit!  EDIT - 6/07 A big group of us came the other day and we ordered EVERYTHING.  Holy crap, was this shiz good.  My 3 star experience became a 4 star one.  The filet was rockin, and so was the grilled asparagus, but even better was this Spanish cheese spread over crusty bread and the garlic and chile marinated grilled shrimp.

Went to Cardinals Stadium (now called University of Phoenix Stadium) on Sunday for the Cardinals/Rams game - and what a difference a few hundred million, a retractable roof, and some AC make.  It becomes quite evident how awful having an NFL team play in Sun Devil Stadium was. The drive to the Westside is well worth it.  It's a gorgeous facility, that is the envy of the stadium/arena world.    Only minus is for the guy a few rows up who drank too much and hurled all over himself and the rows in front of him.  Guy knows how to clear a room.  Plus stadium staff didn't clean up the area as well as they could have....boo!

I was a big fan of Eddie Matney's at 24th and Camelback, so I had reasonable hopes for Stoudemire's, that I feel were unmet.  I was here with a large group earlier this week and noshed on apps such as chicken strips, pulled pork and slaw sandwiches and chips and guacamole.  The pulled pork sandwiches were the highlight, btw.    Not a fan of the nondescript fancy sportsbar decor, and I am especially not a fan of the 7:30 pm closing time on a Tuesday.  I get the whole frontierness of the fledgling downtown dining scene, but the early roll-up the welcome mat thing sucks.  LAME!

Retail Laboratory huh?  Sounds kinda like a place where Scottsdale shoppers are conceived in a test tube.    I'm a huge fan of this place, but like the other reviewers find the prices a bit prohibitive.  But make no mistake, if you're looking for something cheap -- you WOULDN'T be coming to a Biltmore Fashion Park boutique to find it anyways.  So that criticism is sort of a moot point.    It's about the same size as their old loft space on Roosevelt - which has since closed.  Highlights * Stylish mens/womens boutique but seemingly more friendly than their Scottsdale counterparts. * Hip labels such as James Perse, J Lindeberg and Modern Amusement mixed with smaller unknown but up-and-coming indie labels. * Nice selection of pricey chotckies: hipster accessories, novelty books and other assorted cute-but-useless crap.  Worth a visit, if just to browse to see the interesting collection.

I love to hike Piestewa (formerly known as Squaw) Peak, obviously not for the solitude - since it's so crowded.    It's a rigorous 2.4 (round-trip) mile hike and NOT for beginners.  But it is the most fun.   It reminds me of our version of the New York street scene - almost egalitarian in a way.  You see people of all sizes, ages, ethnicities, physical abilities, socioeconomic levels, families, friends, lovers, first-dates.  This is where you see Phoenix's diversity, ladies and gentlemen.  It's definitely a wonderful first impression of Phoenix -- from the cross-section of society to the people-watching, and last but not least, the AMAZING breathtaking views, of wildlife (like roadrunners, chipmunks, and lizards), flora and the Valley below.  It's been noted as one of the most hiked trail in in the nation.

Tradiciones fires on all cylinders like a Speedy Gonzales hot rod and I'm lovin it. I am a sucker for strolling mariachis, mamacita servers in red frilly dresses, festive digs and authentic and delicious Mexican food.  Usually one or some of those elements are missing from your typical Mexican restaurant. It seems like not much to ask for, but I can't seem to get it all at once in Phoenix.  They even somehow manage to pull it off without seeming cheezy or contrived.  I'm not that surprised though. Tradiciones IS right next door to Phoenix Ranch Market, which was accurately described by Mr. K as Mexican Disneyland and is what Food City wishes it was.  Since the entire strip is a renovated K-Mart from back in the day, Tradiciones has taken over the old Garden Center space, which you'll notice is now a cool plaza-style patio with space for a band. It's hard to choose between their inside or outside, but indoors is where you'll find the lunchtime buffet if you're in a hurry, and a high ceilinged dining room and more Mexican murals and colorful decoration you can imagine.  I was here most recently for a business lunch with suits and formality and all that mess.   Food highlights include the Bistec ala Mexicana simmering in a red caldo of veggies and sauteed beef strips (reminiscent of my mom's btw), the pollo margarita simmered in margarita mix with chipotle ranch and queso fresco was ok, but the clear winner was the seafood enchiladas (shrimp and veggies in a lobster cream sauce) - simpler than how they do at Barrio, but every bit as good.  I really enjoyed the fresh lemonade.  This place also passed my Mexican litmus test of beans, rice and tortillas (they have to taste at least as good as my grandma's).  If a restaurant can't master those staples, then it's a hopeless effort.    The servers here are quick and courteous, but speak Spanish for the most part. The food was about a solid 4 stars, but the service, decor, atmosphere and just plain real-ness elevate it further to 4.5 stars.

If you had told me last week that I would be giving a cafe in Gilbert five stars I would have told you you're crazy.  Folks, YOU CRAZY!!  I was not expecting to be wowed by the unassuming uptown Romeo's Euro Cafe in Gilbert's little downtown district.  But it delivered and outdid itself.    After the painfully hard decision based on the huge and extensive menu, I ordered the Avocado Feta Pita ($7) and was BLOWN away by the taste. The inside of the pita revealed a sauteed melange of grilled turkey, avocado, feta and a special dressing.  I'm a huge fan of avocado, so I had an inkling I might like this - but I was a bit skeptical of the sauted part of this.  That's a bit too decadent and rich for my tastes.   But I didn't care.  That's how freaking good this pita was.  I'm a dude and don't have hips or anything, but if bigger hips were a consequence for this, LAY IT ON BABY!!    Was it authentic Greek?  Not at all.  I would consider it more New American, with Mediterranean influences.  It didn't stop there though.  My fellow eating partner ordered the Corinthian salad ($11), which looked mighty attractive I might add - and I don't care for salads at all.   It was gigantic and came appointed with grilled chicken, artichoke, hearts of palm, red peppers, mushroom, feat and capers in a Italian dressing.   Sounds pretty pedestrian until you see the size of the presentation and the veggies used (marinated mushrooms, for example).    Dessert was just as incredible.  That's what you first notice when you walk in the door, btw - the big glass counter full of freshly baked desserts - from cheesecakes to tarts, you name it they probably have it.   The apple strudel was a rather large portion, flaky and not too sweet.  But the runaway winner (that even the server agreed on) was the caramel kiss cheesecake - caramel marbled with dark chocolate.  The texture and taste outdid even the Cheesecake Factory.   While lunch was pretty cheap and basically consists of pitas, burgers, subs and salads, the dinner menu is larger (chicken, seafood, Greek plates and pasta) and seems to run a bit higher at $15 - $20 for entrees.  The space itself lives up to its name with marble tabletops and wrought iron chairs.   It feels very Euro and very cafe inside - with a decidedly boutique feel.  While it's not overly lady-like in here, it would be kind of uncomfortable for a casual everyday Joe used to steakhouses and burger joints.   Good service despite the busy and brisk lunch time crowd.  Romeo's Euro Cafe is really out of the way for me but definitely worth going out of my way for.  I can't wait to return.

Huge portions and long waits are the name of the game here.  It was about 30 minute wait for us - not too bad, I suppose.    They don't use plates here - think PLATTERS, obesity and the answer to why Europeans are more healthy than us!  I ordered the delicious bacon avocado swiss and onion scramble with their crispy potatoes and a biscuit w/freshly made strawberry jam. I recommend forgoing those and trying the griddled mashed potatoes.  I found the crispy potatoes flavorless and boring.  The biscuit and strawberry jam were divine, however.  They have a full bar and feature some Midwestern kitsch - such as Milwaukees Best in a brown bag as one of the menu items.  Love the attitude on the menu.  The server almost messed up the order and gave my scramble to a couple who had just arrived.  It was corrected quickly.   Definitely worth the drive from the Strip, but if you're looking for a good breakfast and looking to get away from the casinos, save your money and try Blueberry Hill.   I think that's a better value.

Holy crap!  What a hidden and lush surprise this is!  I almost don't want to review it, so it won't be overrun by others.   * Sloping hills * Grassy knolls * Bubbling brooks * Flowering lilypads * Quaint Japanese tea house * Towering trees * Splashing waterfalls * Quiet tranquility   Above the Interstate 10 and in the middle of Phoenix?!?!  Yes, and for only a $3 entry fee, you too can enjoy this calm piece of gated heaven with views of pretty office towers and downtown condos.  For 50 cents you can even purchase some fish food from the cute little old ladies inside the gift shop office trailer out front and feed the hundreds of koi in the pond.    The garden is only about 5 years old, but 20 years in the planning and building with collaborative efforts by planners, arborists and landscapers from both Phoenix and a sister city in Japan.  It's one of my new favorite places to getaway and relax - a welcome oasis in the middle of the city.

Unless you're dying don't even think about getting decent service from our city's finest.  After a late-night vehicle burglary I learned very quickly how Phoenix PD deals with its non-emergency situations.  They don't.   Well only during certain hours and on certain days, and if you're hopping on one foot.   A 24 hour police department this isn't.  The irony is I felt like I was in a smaller city, not the nation's fifth largest city.  Actually no.  In a medium-sized city, someone would have picked up the phone and I wouldn't have to hear a computerized loop for 40 minutes.  Realizing this wasn't a 911 emergency I called the non-emergency line and got NOWHERE.  I was put on hold for 40 minutes before finally getting an operator who told me to call back later - at 6 AM!!   I saw two motorcycle cops pass by in that 40 minute gap and could chased one down faster than this phone call.  Turns out they do police reports on the phone these days.  Convenient for me.  Convenient for police.  And convenient for soon-to-be-hired outsourced telephone operators abroad.    The process goes like this.    You call to report your incident.  They take your name number and call you back - a "Don't call us, we'll call you" sort of thing.  OK.  Fine.  You basically have to sit by your phone until they call.    Of course they call back when I'm in the bathroom taking care of bidness.  I call them back only to be told I have to to the back of the 2 hour queue.  Oh yes, and they occasionally close down to "work on their lists" when the queue gets too long - which means that you have to call back for that reason as well.  So after a few times of that nonsense I get through to someone 10 hours later.  I had good service once I got through to a police officer, but getting through to someone IS THE BATTLE.

Getting waitlisted for a trip to the Galapagos might be easier than getting back to City Bakery.  They are NOT open on weekends and are only open for 4 hours, so I had to wait for a time that I was Downtown during the day and hop on one foot.  (It's actually south of downtown in an industrial / semi-sketchy neighborhood.)  These sandwiches are AMAZING, and I mean "amazing" in a "I'm glad City Bakery's location and hours are completely inconvenient, because I would go broke" sort of way.  Sure, they're upscale and a bit pricey, but what's not to like about Arcadia Farms sandwiches ($9), salads ($10) and baked goods?  While other Arcadia Farms places seem to attract a more ladies-who-lunch crowd, City Bakery definitely attracts a more downtown professional crowd, and they cater to them with minimalist modern decor and CNN piped in on TVs throughout.  I couldn't decide which sandwich I LOVED better - the muffuleta, the curry chicken or the turkey brie.  If I were to choose I would have to say the muffuleta - with its nearly perfect ciabatta, savory Italian meats, provolone, olive tapenade and sundried tomatoes (which was a tasty surprise).  Shannon is right on about the olive spread -- it IS addictive.  And there are four sandwich choices for vegetarians.  As if that wasn't enough they have a full menu of baked goods.  Uh, hello, this is a bakery.  With the awesome sandwiches you almost forget to leave room for the cookies, cupcakes and tarts.  I took a chocolate chip to go, because, well, I'm a sucker for cookies, and it ended up being just as incredible and sinfully decadent as I thought.  MINUSES:  The bookstore and Bentley art galleries were closed when we went - perhaps that's seasonal?    We were served by a very cute and adept waitress, but the drinks did take about 10 minutes,  That would be my only complaint.  It's minimal at worst, but everything else overcame this flaw.  I'll definitely be back.

Great beers on tap - Four Peaks and Oak Creek among them.  8th St. Ale - I heart you.  The place was playing mid-90s Radiohead and Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid.  That in itself is pure genius.   Liked the beer barrels showcased through a window.  The outdoor deck looks like it will be a real hit when it gets a bit warmer.   Nice cozy feel, warm avocado walls and kick-ass vintage chandeliers that I want to go back and snag!  The highlight of the decor though, is the oddly curious Being John Malkovich doorway up above on your way to the restroom.   My Chicago buddy with me was unimpressed - but I'm sure places like this are a dime a dozen there.  This place rocks.  It's the downtown bar we've all been waiting for.  EDIT, 9/07 - Dave B is right on about the same music being played every night.  I always hear the same exact songs by Radiohead and Coldplay every time I go to Roosevelt.  WEAK!!!

This is easily my favorite cafe in all of Tempe - and perhaps the Valley - for lunch and baked goods.  The atmosphere is charming and understated from the way you order to the friendly service you wouldn't expect from a counter service kind of place.  I'm always torn on whether to order the croque monseiur or the warm open faced steak sandwich.  Both of the sandwiches are superbly prepared and presented.  You can't go wrong with either.  I always opt for the dijon potato side salad garnished with mustard seed.  The warm open faced steak sandwich is tastefully done with tender grilled ribeye with a cabernet butter and sauteed mushrooms and bleu cheese.  Rich, sinful and bad but in a good way, kind of like sex with an old ex.  Similarly the croque monseiur has me hooked, but their use of de-seeded jalapenos adds a distinctive Arizona touch that I just love.  While waiting for my lunch I can never resist their outstanding macarons (I prefer the chocolate, but both are delicious), cakes and cookies (go for the chocolate truffle) displayed so innocently behind the glass case where you order.  Since I am friends with someone who works here, she doesn't serve us (company policy), so service is usually by the manager, and once we even got the chef, which was a nice surprise because I was able to ask her details on the sandwiches.  And finally, because they use organic and locally grown ingredients you can leave feeling like not-so much of an asshat.

A co-worker just got car-jacked here at knifepoint last night.  Can anyone say Ghetto Fabulous?  Do you have an old car you're trying to get rid of?    Camera ads?   Craigslist?  Ahh, too much work. Bring it on down to Metrocenter, someone will gank it!  According to a law enforcement study done last month Metrocenter is the most popular place in the Valley to get your car stolen.  Klassy!  And according to a Stevey study conducted last month, just a quick look around the skanky store mix, trashy and/or gang-infested clientele and deserted area concluded that this is one scarey-ass, ghetto-fied mall.  (not a scientific study, btw)  This mall is way past its hey-day (1975-1985).  It's a really sad place now.  Visit at your own risk.

8-1/2 is now my new favorite gay bar in Las Vegas.  Finally.  Gipsy is a dump, and Krave is too cavernous and over-the-top, so you can see my preference for 8-1/2.  The interior is sexy and cool with plush sofas here and there.  I don't recall much of the place if you know what I mean, but I do remember it had a somewhat attractive crowd, and that one of our smooth-talking boys talked the door mistress out of the cover charge.  Saweet!  I'll go back and do it again.

Yuck. My friends like this place. Who the hell knows why.   Maybe it's because Gipsy has been there forever. For many years pre-Krave and pre-Piranha, it was the ONLY decent gay bar in Vegas. I use the term "decent" lightly, as when I was there a year ago one of the bathroom areas was roped off because some sicko took a dump there and clogged the toilet that flooded the floor.  Eww!  We went at Midnight on Saturday a few weeks ago and it was dead.  There were maybe 10 people in the entire bar. Apparently, everyone was next door at Piranha/8-1/2.  If they're charging a cover, don't bother.

I usually find myself here when I'm staying with the parents in their timeshare.   I find the Wyndham Grand Desert much nicer than expected, even when it was a Fairfield.  And that makes sense, now that I know (from Susan's review) that it was designed by  the person who designed Bellagio.   We usually stay here in the colder months so I haven't ventured into the pool. The interior of our 3 bedroom suite is especially luxe with a contemporary feel.  LOVE that it doesn't have a casino.  I'm not much of a gambler anyway, but it's makes for a nice and quiet hotel experience.  Shuttles to the Strip make going to a casino relatively easy, and Planet Hollywood and Hard Rock  are only short walks away.  The location on Koval and Harmon provide for stunning views of the Strip if you get a north facing room.  The activities room, happy hour snacks and Internet/computer center were also bonus.

Talk about a steakhouse the crew from Rockford Files or Three's Company would go to.  Like Durant's is to the clubby, rat pack 1950s, Cork N Cleaver is in a 1970s time warp.    The food is solid and dependable and presented in a classic setting. The ambiance inside is old-school mission style from the late 70s with saltillo tile throughout.  Nothing trendy here.  The winner here I felt was the salad bar.  It was rather large and had every toppings imaginable.  My prime rib ($24) was cooked right on (not too rare, and not too well-done) and set over a bed of tasty rice pilaf .  We tried the crabcakes,  which were a good pick to start out.  The crowd here for a Friday evening was busy with lots of families milling about to/from the salad bar.  Not much of a wait however, which was nice.  I will definitely go back - if just for the retro feel and cleaver menus.  Klassy.    Is this the best steakhouse in town?  Probably not, but it's priced right and has tons of retro character.

These pasties are huge.  I mean they're bigger than Janet Jackson's breasts, and they are a steal at $7 or so.   So for value, quality and portions this is probably among your best bets in Tempe.  Punk rock and British pub grub are predictable and go together like PB&J, but Cornish Pasty is probably one of the more distinctive restaurants in the Valley for its niche of pasties in a quick service restaurant/diner setting.  My buddy was in town visiting and staying in Tempe wanted something unique for the area.  Given that he's used to Mexican, I opted for Cornish Pasty since it was nearby.  My friend couldn't finish his Oggie, with steak, potato, onion & rutabaga, but I couldn't resist polishing off the Cajun, blackened chicken breast, bacon, ham and swiss, served with an addictive side of chipotle sauce.  Spicy, but not overwhelming, but a bit on the greasy side as a warning.   The beer selection here is admirable, and had we not had to go back to work for the man that day, we would have certainly indulged.  Kronenbourg, Boddington's and Strongbow on tap, plus your expected hipster brews available by the bottle: Chimay and Rogue among them. The setting looks diner-ish with its long narrow strip mall set-up and open kitchen.  The atmosphere here is dark and weathered, but not dumpy.    The difficulty here is deciding on a pasty.  I could have easily gone for a meat and cheese, a Mexican pasty, or chicken tikka masala. Luckily, our server was very knowledgeable about the different pasties as we couldn't make up our mind, so his recommendations were well taken.

This theater isn't nearly as scary as people make it out to be - it's just a relic from the early 90s when Mills malls were the rage all over the country.  Now they just look dated and have a different crowd.  I was dragged here on a Thursday night to lose a few brain cells watching a mind-numbing comedy with five other people in the entire ghost town of a theater. I'll never be able to get those hours back, but even if they offered refunds for that at the box office I am sure Harkins would direct us to the self-service machine only to have it break down on us.  Melinda's card wouldn't swipe when we were trying to buy tickets on one machine - so we moved to the other machine where the transaction was successful, but the tickets and receipt didn't print.  We then had to go to the box office, which is exactly what those machines were meant to prevent, to tell them our tickets didn't print.  The manager simply just let us in.  I suppose we could have made up that story entirely.  Maybe we will next time.

Fuego is appropriately named, because this place is on fire. I'm not a big fan of Nuevo Latino places, because usually they underdeliver and end being more Mexican than Latin American.   The setting here couldn't be better.  Stop the presses.  Finally a restaurant.....not...in...a...strip....mall.  It feels like it's a neighborhood cafe you would find in New York or something. It's located on a side street off 7th St. and Bethany Home in a cozy courtyard building.  Kind of hidden. About 10 tables in the whole restaurant and a few patio tables.  The food here is outstanding.  For apps, we had empanadas and the coconut scrimps. It seriously had to be the best empanada I have ever had.  The pastry crust had just the right texture of flakes and bubbles.  It was filled with ground beef and herbs and topped with black beans, corn and pepper jack cheese.  Get the Pernil asado.  It's oddly reminscent of the cochinita pibil at Barrio, but better.  Drinks were pretty cheap ($5 Bacardi and coke), and the service was great.  The owner served us.  He was casual wearing a black hoodie, so it caught us off guard, but he was quick and attentive.  I really couldn't find anything wrong with the place, but don't feel it's entirely a 5 star place.  4.5 stars.

* Flamethrowers * Stare-down contests * Cyclist activists sporting pink undies * DJ spinning in a treehouse * Cool beer and wine bars * Oh yes, and art.  Real, organic art made by our local neighbors.    It's not in New York, not in Chicago -- it's all in our downtown Phoenix.  I like to credit Artlink with single-handedly improving the vibrancy of Downtown Phoenix with its First Friday Artwalk.  It's one of my favorite pasttimes about living in Phoenix and is a true testament to the cultural destination our area has become.   I read somewhere that it's the largest artwalk in the country now and is growing each month.   I make it a habit to go every month.  It's something everyone (art-lover or not) should experience.

Since The Arizona Republic disemboweled itself (corporate-style) earlier this year, they took an already weak big-city daily (which relied heavily on AP wire stuff) and are flying downhill.  Never mind the fact that the paper is routinely criticized for being in bed with downtown, big-business and real estate interests.  Very rarely does the paper take courageous investigative approaches - they instead settle for overly focused watered down community reporting.    I rarely turn to the USA Today-owned Republic for my news consumption because the reporting is rarely comprehensive or relevant.  .   When your serious big-city newspaper finds itself having to resort to social networking web strategies to keep the lowest common denominator satisfied, you know your newspaper has lost any shred of credibility.   Next!

Looks like Gregg Edelman (the owner) has expanded his offerings.  I never went to the old gallery (on 3rd St.), but since his move to 7th Ave., his offerings and square footage must have grown.  I moseyed in here the other day (on a First Friday) before dinner next door at Harley's to check out the art.  I found the art to be more diverse - lots of contemporary landscape paintings and flowers, and even one painting of an American Indian.  The entire front half of the storefront features lof of artsy chotchkies for sale -- ala tacky gift shop.  Tons of small prints and assorted gift items for sale.  I spotted some work by an artist who shapes copper wire art into animals and trees for sale.   This place was much busier than expected given it's northerly location for First Friday.  But it's not your typical Downtown FF gallery in the traditional sense.  Another great addition to the 7th Ave street scene.

Aside from debating the merits of what constitutes a four star vs. a five star review with Bonnie G and Erica O (aka Judith Light from Who's the Boss), or the Carrie Bradshaw-like storytelling from Sarah K., I can't really decide what the highlight of the evening was.  Here are the highlights of the Lost Leaf.   . Great lighting,  . Awesome hardwood floors,  . Exposed brickwork everywhere  . Near-perfect sound level at just the right decibel for the late 20s and 30s Downtown scenester crowd inside. . Art created by locals adorns the walls.   . Cool little side patio for smokers. . Diverse bottled beer selection (perhaps that's to make up for the lack of beers on tap - which is zero. . Awkward bar layout - that makes for difficult traffic flow to back half of bar when it's busy.  Yes, this is a hybrid bar - art gallery, and I like it a lot, but not enough to warrant a five star rating.  Why?  Something seems a bit lacking here and I'm not sure what it is.  Regardless, this was a great place to hold the first-ever Yelp event.  It's a great space, don't get me wrong, but I can't say enthusiastically it's five star.  Here's a tip:  AVOID on a First Friday.  It's way too packed and not worth waiting in line to see and do.

Better luck next year guys.  The Phoenix Suns are the pride of Arizona when it comes to professional sports.  Let's face it, we have some pretty sorry sports teams here.    They're the only local team (a star studded team loaded with talent) that actually wins consistently, and they're a class act on & off the court.  Cheers to the Suns - my second favorite basketball team (close second).

Stevey does Chandler, Part Tres.  (The DVD boxed set will be out soon, btw.)  I typically try to avoid malls and avoid treks to Chandler, but if I MUST shop at a mall I like going to Chandler Fashion Center.  I find it to be a happy medium between the mundane average joe malls of the Valley and the luxury malls of Scottsdale.  It has an interesting layout, a respectable Nordstrom, a decent restaurant/theater area - and a mix of typical chain stores you'd find at a mall - but stores that people can actually afford to shop at.  Cheers to that.

Iguana Macks can be a great reality check. If anything, it will remind you how suburbanites in the rest of the country get down. Take any themed tropical bar, ala Rainforest Cafe, that you might find in Bakersfield or Indianapolis, and throw in a dancefloor and some Buck Hunter - and ta da - you have Iguana Macks!  We found ourselves here after a cornhole tournament died down a few neighborhoods away. This place is quite the mob scene on weekends and feels as if half of the singles in Gilbert and Chandler are up in here wearing their evening best -- whether it be from Wet Seal for the ladies or guys sporting black/white caps over their brows ensembles from TapOut.   So you have a few choices: * Try to engage in some mind-numbing small talk with the regulars. * Be among the first (because no one else in the club is drunk enough) on the dancefloor to the local band doing mid-90s alt rock covers. * Or hide in the corner with your friends, and avoid everyone while sharpen your Buck Hunter skills.  We tried those three options in exactly that order until we couldn't take it anymore.

4.5 STARS  This is one of my favorite lunch places.  I have never seen the Arrowhead Paradise Bakery when it's NOT a complete madhouse.  Perhaps it's because there really aren't that many good places to get a sandwich in this neck of the woods.  Who knows.  The service line for this counter-style joint went out the door last week when I was there - but it's still worth the wait, I think.  And somehow, the staff does their job well, and keep churning out happy customers.  I'm not a fan of soup, at all.  It's just not my thang.  BUT, their legendary Fire Roasted Tomato soup does weird things to me.  It is heavenly.  I crave it!  I look forward to it the day before, get cranky if they don't have it for whatever reason, etc, etc.  I usually order it with the turkey chipotle wrap - with it's chipotle raspberry cheese smear - is a tangy mix of spicy and sweet.  And the cookies, while they seem like an afterthought of the tasty lunch, are just as good as you would think.   This is one of the few locations that is free-standing and NOT in a mall, so expect more room, nicer furniture, chairs, tables.  Expect an uppity Arrowhead soccer mom / business casual crowd, and expect to wait  15 minutes to order.

Dang, I'm jealous of this Henderson 24 Hour Fitness.  It's swank, clean, and almost shrine-like in its graphic devotion to Andre Agassi. And believe it or not, I'm OK with that!!  I usually haul my fat ass here when I've overdone it at a hotel/casino buffet.  I find the equipment here to run the gamut, from older to newer, and despite the time of day I never found it difficult or crowded in using equipment.  The facility is large and easy to find in a Pecos and Wigwam strip mall - a quick 15 minute drive from the Southern part of the Strip.

4.5 stars.  There's something weirdly charming about Homme.  Not sure if it's the cheap drinks, the crowd, the converted two-story house layout, the Central Phoenix club circuit regulars, or the fact that it's constantly evolving -- adding DJs/nights seemingly all the time.    I went here the other night for Friday's relocated French Kiss newwave/indie/punk/electro dance party and have to say it was a blast.  I had been here a few times before - once on a Thursday night with Bonnie, once for Tuesday night karaoke, and even when it was a creepy old fogey gay bar a few years ago.  The space is just right for the dance party, and the upstairs DJ/dancefloor area lends itself well to those who are seeking an added bonus - in this case, deep house.  The decor here is OK, nothing special, really - although it is more brightly lit, and brightly painted than it used to be.  Lots of nooks and crannies here and an intimidating narrow spiral staircase, which is good if you get bored with conventional spaces.  The crowd is diverse (gay, straight, black, white, brown, whatevs) and depending on the night it's crawling with hipsters, club kids and electro/new wave/indie/tribal/house/breakbeat aficionados.  These are the types of people who go somewhere for the music and could give an eff about anything else.  With the clientele and music selection, Homme has the feel of a more cosmopolitan LA/SF dance club, but without the attitude.  Homme will be seeing more of Stevey, no doubt.

I was skeptical, but when she asked me if I was coming on Thursday dressed as a pilgrim for free drinks -- that's when I decided I loved Monkey Pants.  Yes, the bartender girl also tried to interest me in a round of goldfish racing, shuffleboard, or some board games, I just about lost it.  This place rocks.  Monkey Pants takes "Campy" and "Kitschy" and magnifies those terms by 1,000.  This place is not pretty in its strip mall glory, and would be considered a dive by most folks.  I was on sensory overload, taking in the fish tanks, bad decor, construction paper turkey/hand cut-outs, grandma couches and grandma lamps, the leg lamp from the Christmas Story, the video-feed fireplace looping in the corner -- all the while trying to envision myself in a pilgrim get-up.  She wasn't kidding.   Some co-workers and I found ourselves here for their $3.95 hot wing night happy hour and had cheep drinks, plus a complimentary grape tootsie roll shot.  Grand total?  9 bucks and change.  Toothless grey haired Willy mocked us "Suits" folks as we left the place, but...  I'm sooo there next week and I might even show my chest for a free shot at 1 am.

I freely admit that I am a cookie whore.  Imagine the Cookie Monster glammed up and walking Van Buren.  Yep, that would be me - doing anything for a cookie.  Or maybe that makes me a Cookie Hooker,  a tried-and-true Cook-ker perhaps?    Anyhow, along comes Urban Cookies on an increasingly cool part of 7th St.  to make me consider settling down for this AZ goodie.  Well, I haven't quite settled down or anything -  I'm still shoppin around.  But, the "Simple Urban" cookie which is their simple milk chocolate chip - is one noble effort.  Not quite the best cookies ever, but a valiant try.  The mix of ingredients and baking on this is really good.  Perhaps a little too soft from the June heat, but not bad.  Besides being 99% organic, it's soft, chewy, with just the right taste of vanilla and wheat.    The owners are a married couple who bake early in the morning and spend the rest of the day packaging the treats for sale, either one-by-one or by the dozen.   They market themselves as the hip, funky alternative to Mrs. Fields - and they're about right on.  These cookies haven't quite made a religious convert out of me or made the Cookie Monster in me give up walking Van Buren - but still good nevertheless.

Wow -- cheap, delicious, OK service, and upscale Arcadia vibe inside.   I'm sold.   I'm aware of the complaints of the Tempe location, so I'm on guard.  Although it's newly opened, I will def. go back to try out some more.   *Cheap* Dinner for two with an appetizer and drinks was $22.   *Delicious* The food was was great.  Cilantro jalapeno hummus?  OMG.  I'm starting to DROOL just thinking about it again!!  Tangy and zesty, but not spicy enough for you wimps out there.  And with grilled chicken and pine nuts?!?  Yum.  Beef and shawarma gyros were dependable and good.   Lots of other choices I want to try next time, esp.  the wraps, veggie burgers, pizza and spicy mango shrimp.    *OK service* This one I will let slide since it is only their second week.  Service was kind of sketchy.   It was crowded and we were told in despair by the host to pick our own table in some kind of confused blather.  Our server was cute and attentive, and quick.  She easily accomodated a change in our order.  It took a while to get place settings and menu, because, well, we were told to seat ourselves and our server wasn't aware of this.  Hopefully the confusion will be corrected over time.  *Upscale hip Arcadia vibe* Gorgeous gigantic dark-wood mirror frames the back wall of the strip mall joint.   Open layout , with full length windows and small sleek dark-wood tables throughout with a handful of patio tables out front.  Clientele of talkative (borderline loud) 30-something singles (some w. young kids) reflects the neighborhood.  A bit more polished than the Tempe location, but still OK to dress casual.

We waited for over ONE HOUR for a Valley Metro bus this past weekend.  No joke.  Phoenix in not a transit-friendly city, and I know that.  I'll digress for a minute.  To take a bus in a sprawling car-dependent city such as ours, most would think that you have no car, are having car problems, are poor, etc.  But in planning for the ultimate wild night out we decided to do the responsible thing and take cabs into Scottsdale.  The next morning I woke up with only $5 in my pocket.  Oops.  It could have been worse -- I could have woken up to a worse surprise. (No snickering.  That is neither here nor there.)  Instead of asking friends to cart me around, the urban explorer in me decided to take the bus.  Why not?  I'm not above it.  I walked over to the bus stop at Scottsdale Fashion Square and waited, and waited.  20 minutes turned into 30.  30 turned into 40.  I called the phone number on the bus stop sign and got some automated service telling me my bus would be there in 18 minutes.  Great!!  A total of one hour.  I probably could have walked the 7 miles home in faster than an hour.   Weekday waits aren't much better.  Your hour wait will lessen to a superconvenient 30 minute wait.  Some express routes (on the freeway and a handful of major roads) run more frequently, but are few and far between.  I've used many bus and rail systems, from the MTA (NY & LA) to the CTA, and BART and Muni.  And Valley Metro probably ranks below all of them. (OK, maybe not that one smelly, filthy Muni bus I rode)     I might actually ride the bus more frequently if it ran more often.  But understanding that Valley Metro probably operates under simple economics (supply and demand) I don't see them budging to run more frequently if ridership isn't there.  But guess what?  I'm not going to ride buses, if they are that inconvenient.  So there you have it.  Other than that, the bus ride itself seemed to go much quicker than I thought, and wasn't as dirty as other bus systems.  Plus it was only $1.25 to ride.  Hopefully more Phoenix citizens will ride transit - I think that's the only way bus service will improve (not to mention improving traffic and air quality :-))  I'm eager to see how light rail works out, but if it is as disappointing as the bus then count me out.  Shame on us Phoenix.  We deserve better.

I got me some Paper denim jeans on sale here for $45, an English Laundry tee and some Donald J Pliner shoes for half off - and ever since I was hooked.   Roka is a small mens/womens boutique in the Arrowhead AJ's shopping center - heavy on the denim with shirts, sweaters, belts and shoes.  The owners are friendly and offer guests water and candy when you're shopping (or maybe it's just me).   Every so often they'll have a steal of sale - including their denim sales in February.  Who says you have to hoof it to Scottsdale for fancy duds?

My hunt for sheet music and music books sent me to this Sam Ash the other day.  The location is a bit bizarre, methinks.  Wouldn't the only Valley location for this make more sense in, oh I dunno, Tempe (and not some non-descript part of Glendale)??  In any event, the location was (oddly-enough) convenient for moi.  It's located in an old grocery store strip mall, all by its lonesome.  But in the middle of the day it was more hoppin than I expected.    The customer service peeps were more than accommodating.  I had no idea what I was looking for, really, but they helped me spit it out.    The instrument, guitar selection was wall-to-wall and went clear from the floor to the ceiling -- no space was unspoken for.  I rarely frequent music stores, but this once they were great -- would def. go back again.

Simply amazing and completely fitting for a 500th review.    I don't know that a more lengthy first sentence can do it any better. I'll spare you from the I went to Spain bullcrap, but I do know good Spanish dining on several different levels and Sol y Sombra overdelivers like a good night in the sack, and to help others this is completely worth the 30 mile drive north for Central Phoenix dwellers.   If you walk away from this review with two tidbits, just know that the Tortilla Espanola (while basic-sounding and all) is the best $5 you will spend on a dinner. EVER.  With its huge impressive wedge appearance, it is more deliciously prepared and more filling than expected.  Also know that the wine list is lengthy and very comprehensive, but in an excellent way.  While I love Lola Tapas in Central Phoenix for its urban and sophisticated simplicity, this is one area in which it can't compete.  While the evening was more delightful because of our mailing-list 50-percent-off skillz, it should be even more noteworthy that such a thing is possible if you get off your duffs and give a brotha your email.   Among other highlights would be the Pollo Colonial (a savory mix of sweet and spicy chicken curry), Grilled Calamari, Spicy Garlic Aioli Grilled Prawns, Grilled Asparagus.  But the most surprising of the night were the grilled brussel sprouts.  WTF?  I don't even like that shit.  But they grilled them with garlic, olive oil and seasoning, and if you do it that way it is ten times better than any veggie a teen would hate.  The Patatas Brava were just ok.  I still ate them, but they were a little more crispy than I care for.  The setting was impressive.  The dining room is grand, stylish and luxe in its understated way -- so symbolic of Madrid.  The layout and colors are complementary, trendy and tasteful all at once.  The patio is incredible if you can swing it.  There is not a bad seat in the house as the views from the second floor at DC Ranch are all great.  The host was accommodating given we were 10 minutes late (and called ahead) and the servers and sommelier were definitely helpful and steered us toward the right white wine we wanted for taste and value without trying to do the whole upselling crap.  The wine was excellent and was so fragrant and inviting that Melissa's purse had to have a taste.  Sol y Sombra is a definite five star destination restaurant that is worth it if you're coming from Central Phoenix, West Valley or SE Valley.

A tree grows in Peoria, uh I mean Brooklyn.  A Brooklyn deli settled in Peoria of all places?  WTF is that all about?     It's savvy business sense is what it is.  This corner of the Valley is starved for a New York / Italian deli - and from the throng of a lunch-time crowd I think my hunch is right.  This Denver-based deli is new to town, but is taking the Arrowhead area and this Golds Gym strip mall by storm.  If you get there between 12-1 you're looking at a wait about 10 people deep.   NERD-ALERT ADVERTISING ASIDE You might recall the two-stage clever billboard campaign about a year ago with with a UPS packaged look to it simply messaged with the words "Something is coming from Brooklyn." A ripped corner on the billboard a few weeks later revealed the logo and location.  Ok now, back to the review.  I had heard about the bread here, but didn't take those comments too seriously.  I swear to God.  I have never seen bread so huge, fluffy and decadent.  These freshly-baked loaves sit at the counter taunting would-be customers with their beauty and scrumptiousness.   The marble rye roll was as big as my face.  The sourdough, wheat and white slices must be an INCH AND A HALF THICK!  You walk up to the counter, place your order with your own sandwich maker - which Heidi's has at about 10 staff members deep!  The sandwich selections are typical of New York or Italian delis and the feel of the place with its clubby dark wood booth atmosphere there evokes Brooklyn alright.  I've had the Transplanted New Yorker and Cajun Turkey Avocados sandwiches.   The TNY comes with five Italian meats, provolone and a spicy chipotle aioli.  Holy crap was that sauce HOT.  I mean, I like my food spicy, but I got a big wad of that in one bite, and WOWEE it made me wince a bit.  Another more popular sandwich there (which I want to try next time) is Hells Kitchen - which silly me, I thought was a trendy Manhattan nabe.  The HK is egg salad, bacon, swiss, avocado and the spicy sauce.   Sounds weirdly decadent yet tasty all at once.  The best named item would have to be the "Make Your Own, But Don't Be a Pain in the Ass" Wrap - a more clever way to put it, eh?  If you're a Nathan's Famous hot dog fan, you can get your fix for that here too.   They don't mess around when it comes to portions - with meats on the heavy side.  But at $7 each the sandwiches aren't cheap either.   So you get what you pay for here.   The desserts are similarly fresh-baked, huge and delicious -- having had both the 5-inch square brownies and cookies.  I spied a delicious cannoli here, so keep that in mind too.   After $9 and change you've got yourself some good deli grub, and probably might consider yourself a newly devout fan -- like I do.  Yes folks.  A tree grows in Brooklyn.  And a Brooklyn deli now grows in Peoria.  P.S. Biltmore and Downtown locations are opening later this year.

Does this bag make my butt look big?  Any store that has that written on its shopping bag ROCKS in my book.  And that's Haus for you.  Sleek, modern, irreverent and witty.   Located over in the Biltmore Fashion Park, this is where I go for off-the-wall novelty gifts - everything from frames, to travel accessories, to funny cards, to "I'm Not a Republican" breath mints.  And this is where I WOULD go if I could afford the expensive 1950s modern Copenhagen-ish (but better) furniture.  The staff has always been friendly, helpful, funny and on occasion even cute.   And when women ask the aforementioned "butt" question the answer is ALWAYS a resounding "NO!" -- if you know what's good for you.

Damn Channel 8.  Why must it be so damn addictive?  Apparently its reputation is impressive nationally, as it's the 7th (or something like that) most watched PBS affiliate in only the 13th largest market.  KAET must secretly hate my friends, because I'm not ashamed to admit that I have flaked on friends due to the following:  * A British sitcom marathon. Yes, that's pathetic, but whatever. * An inexplicably captivating Horizon news episode * A Mamas and the Papas special that put VH1's "Behind the Music" to shame * A Garbage concert and tonight's Celtic Woman concert (complete with hottie songstresses) * An Arizona Highways episode that had me completely spellbound * Being a telephone operator and sweet talking the Sun City crew for one of those pledge drives.  Btw, the studio is pretty nice inside, and should be completely awesome when it moves to ASU Downtown next year.

So, boba isn't that novel if you're from an area with a bigger Asian community.  For me growing up and in college, boba was everywhere.  I never really got into it, so I don't have a seasoned boba palate, but I do know a good boba cafe when I see one and Eba is the real deal.  The little details here struck me as legit.    * The boba flavors and extras are extensive - probably about 50 or so different flavors and way to order. I opted for the vanilla green tea complete with little tapioca balls at the bottom, which satiated my (at the time) liquid diet. * Hot food lunch offerings. When I met Gabi and other Yelpers I noticed I could have even had a full-on rice chicken curry lunch.   *  But the icing on the cake was the karaoke set in the corner.  Hellz YES, how authentically Asian -- Karaoke when you're sober!!  Oh the horror, good thing no one spiked my boba otherwise I would have been strutting on the table singing "Humpty Dance" by Digital Underground much to my and your dismay.  I'm liking you Eba.  I'll warn you next time so you have sufficient time to confiscate the aforementioned karaoke machine.  I will be back.

S'Bistro is every bit as good as Bonnie G says.  And she is a woman of her word because, she SHO did have her birthday here, and I attended.  It was times like these I wish there were a half-star rating, because S'Bistro is better than 4 stars, but not quite 5.   I have not had food this good or attractively presented in a while.  In some ways this restaurant still feels new - although it's been open since Sept. 06.  On a Tuesday night it was just our dinner party and another on a rather barren and eerily quiet part of Downtown Mesa.  The owners were super friendly and went out fo their way to make us feel at home -- even allowing us to choose the tunes and chill our brought-in dessert in the fridge.  We scored the circular high-backed banquette booth in the back - which made us all feel real classy and shit -- as if the tuscan-paint scheme, candles and chandeliers weren't enough.  I felt they were trying to rush us in the beginning, but that seemed to wear off when it was obvious we were going to be a while.  The rest of the evening didn't feel as pushy.   The food here was spectacular.  Everything I ate was delicious, seasoned, cooked and presented with care -- all with an edible orchid on top.  The highlight among the appetizers was the portobello mushroom.  Granted all of the appetizers we tried were terrific (including the salmon cakes with dill sauce and the baked brie, garlic and blueberry compote), but the portobello was melt in your mouth tasty - arriving on a bed of sauces.   I mean - it bests any grilled portobello I have ever had.    For dinner I couldn't help but go for the Las Cruces Spicy Chicken salad.  Tons of different flavors here- the Southwestern rub grilled chicken, spinach, vinaigrette, blue cheese, fresh strawberries, mango and pineapple completed this and I am NOT a fan of salad.  It was more delicious and filling than I expected - and a steal for $16 I thought.  It's definitely worth the drive out to Mesa, if you're considering a high-end dinner with some peace and quiet.    Note:  It's BYOB with a corkage fee because they don't have a liquor license -- yet.

I'm gonna take some heat for this, but I really don't care.  I LOVE Claim Jumper.  Say what you will about chain this and chain that, but I hold this restaurant higher than your average chain and with reason.  It takes everything bad about American dining - huge portions, over-the-top decor incl impressive old-school ceiling fans, fattening desserts and huge tedious menus and unabashedly flaunts it.  I call it the Sierra Nevada version of Cheesecake Factory.  I've been going here for years - so I may be blinded by the nostalgia value, but I think the food is of better quality than your typical chain.  I very rarely come here anymore because every location is far-flung since Claim Jumper is adored by suburban soccer parents from here to Chicago, but my buddy out in South Tempe got me to make the trek last week for his birthday.  My favorites here are: * Tri-tip french dip, which is delicious and classically Californian.   * Rotisserie chicken with red skinned mashed potatoes or cheese potatocakes as an option. * Country Fried Steak - with the mashed potatoes adorned with a red apple. :) * Parmesan crusted chicken with angel hair marinara. * Meatball calzone which is bigger than your face.  If you can finish dinner here AND leave room for the gluttonous Chocolate Mother Lode cake or Mud Pie for dessert, I would like to meet you and shake your hand just to be sure you are human.

Palatte takes the best of its historic house digs (around the corner from Cibo) and its smart gourmet sensibilities and caters to the brunch-yearning crowd downtown with flying colors.    You'll find a creative menu with such things as griddle cakes, but my favorite grub here is the scrambled egg mish mash with beef sausage.  It was melt in your mouth good, without all the artery clogging butter you'll find at Matt's down the street.   The counter-style service here was attentive and quick for a somewhat busy crowd.  I was really impressed with Palatte - it's my new favorite breakfast place now -- up there with Farm at South Mountain.  I'm eager to try it again to see if it warrants a fifth star.

I love this place, so stay away.  It's probably Phoenix's best effort at a NY or LA hipster dance den.  It's in an abandoned strip mall, and is divey, dumpy, gross, but hip, cooler than thou, and sneeringly ironic in a way that befits its clientele.  I mean nowhere else can you find a more fun crowd, lit-up Saturday Night Fever dancefloor, chewed-the-hell-up naugahyde furniture, scary bathrooms, and checkerboard tile walls straight out of a David Lynch film.  Each night offers it's own DJs and theme night - everything ranging from Electrostatic, to 90s night to 70s soul and hip hop.  Faux Show Fridays are the best.  Music here is cutting edge - with a few East Coast electro musicians stopping by here to perform.   The club is tiny and rough around the edges.  Drinks are served in plastic cups, but are dirt cheap and potent as hell.  I can't seem to go here without getting crazy trashed.  One time a DJ went to get me a free rum and coke and came back with 151 and coke.   Damn, alright!    People here come from all walks of life (but it skews similar to the crowd at Rogue) - the aforementioned hipsters, literatis, indies, Downtowners, Tempe folk, skanks, hos, freaks, burnouts, gays, straights, bi's, fashionistas, wannabe jogging suit fanatics, some lost truckers, and other sordid but fun characters.    People watching is almost as good as the Scottsdale clubs, but at least the crowd is more fun and dressed in edgier late-80s inspired duds.  I mean one time, I was Blotto out of my mind on the kick-ass dancefloor and spotted some chick getting with some random dude in a Lucha Libre mask.   God I love this place, did I mention that?

My inner-nerd was excited to hear about NTN Buzztime and team trivia so I was stoked to come down and try this place out.    I wasn't stoked, however, to learn that NTN and team trivia were two different things.  And I wasn't stoked to wait 10 minutes for our server to wipe down our sticky table.  Regardless, this place's parking lot was packed and the bar was buzzing with Thursday night football and baseball fans drinking down pitchers and pints.  Aside from the pool table and shuffleboard, as if that alone wasn't awesome enough - they have FOOZBALL too!!  The food and service was pretty average. I ordered a grilled chicken and ortega chile  sandwich with Monterey jack cheese.  It tasted pretty bland - I ate only half, which if you know me, means it must have been pretty blah.  The fries were the zesty seasoned variety - probably frozen, but were still pretty good.  Rum and cokes here were standard as well.  Glasses were shorter than expected, but neither too weak, nor too strong.   Now to the trivia.  It's team driven and can go kind of slow.  So the bigger the group at the table, the more brainpower (but also, the more likely for differing answers and arguments).  For my friend and I, who thought we were at a disadvantage - we coasted to 3rd place (out of 10).  Not too bad, and we won a gift certificate back to Hazelwoods.  I'll use it someday I'm sure.  Like when I'm in the neighborhood or something.  Not in a big rush.   P.S.  It was Grover who was on the cover of Sesame Street Fever, in case you're wondering.  EDIT: 11/07 Ok, I'm downgrading to a one-star review, which is for the understaffed Saturday when I went to watch Big-Ten football and have some lunch with a gift certificate.  One server to about 30 people in the entire restaurant portion.  To add insult to injury, I paid with a $10 GC and left a $2 tip for an $8 lunch and the server chased me out when I left and couldn't wait any longer.  Service was so slow and the attitude of the server toward me in the parking lot was uncalled for.

Where do I begin?  Bunky is rad -- plain and simple.  It's an edgy urban boutique in a small hidden storefront in the backyard of a house in Roosevelt Row.    If you're a guy and you have a penchant for RVCA (jeans and tees), kick ass hats and fedoras ($50), branded tees from Alternative, Spraygraphic and Phoenician, or wacky cheeky tees featuring an argyle pattern, one with a skater Saddam, or a mustachio tee purchased by my dear Bonnie G -- then this place is for you.  Sign me up!  Oh yes, and the ladies gear is every bit as cheeky, edgy and urban --like the 80s army pattern mini-skirt with chiffon fringe.

If a delicious Thai joint collided with a staid log-cabin interior you would find Tipps 88 Thai at your service.  It's relatively new (almost 1 year) and in a curious setting (a Kill Bill style sushi place?), but no less satisfying.  I was here for lunch recently and had decent food, ok service and an overall good experience here.   The well-designed menu is very helpful for novices, giving ample descriptions and some photos.  The lunch special shrimp pad thai (which came with a peanut dressing side salad) did not disappoint.  The portions were generous for $7, there was just enough shrimp, and even better -- the food tasted shrimpy and almost briny, compared to other restaurants that cook the pad thai and then toss in (name your meat here) at the end.  My dining partner Gabi, had an (add your colorful adjective here) amazing eggplant tofu curry.  The stream of lunchtime diners was steady but cleared by 1 p.m.  I found the food and service to be much more pleasing than Thai Basil and is a reliable choice if you're wanting Thai in Tempe.

I admit.  I have an "in" to these brownies.  I had several boxes of Fairytale Brownies mailed to my home a while back as part of my college alumni club dealings. Long story, but my duty at that time was to acquire an alum donation (yes a DONATION) of, you guessed it - Fairytale Brownies.  Well, damn them. To hell.   Turns out the CEO of Fairytale Brownies is a fellow alum.  Fight on! I would love to meet her to tell her what a genius she is.   Each bite-sized "sprite" package comes in several wonderfully addictive flavors. Despite their plastic-wrapped appearance, they are ever so soft, chocolatey and decadent.  My personal favorites are the chocolate chip and the toffee.  It was one of the more trying episodes with willpower to have just one of these brownies and not devour an entire box -- cardboard and all.  My alma mater thanks me.  And so does my waistline.

I think the piano and the older crowd give this gay bar a bad rap.  My friend Jeff and I like it a lot nevertheless -- probably because it makes us feel 21.  It's become a Sunday day drinking outpost for us. It's a great space in Park Central Mall featuring:  * a granite "J" shaped bar * a living area with black leather sofas, * a bright and vibrant paint scheme,  * a large smoking patio, * plasma TVs playing music videos,  * a huge 100 foot long diagonally sloped skylight - for lots of natural light, and  * a nice piano ringed by tables and cushy bar stools.   What's not to like, right?  Every day features some kind of daily drink special and they do a Sunday night and Tuesday night karaoke thing.  The bartenders pour them strong, and the customers are pretty nice too.  I think the older crowd rap and the Central Ave. location have kept people away, but that's just fine by me.

While most Targets are EVIL (in a good way, for having all kinds of cool stuff), this store takes the cake and is SUPER EVIL! I love it. I think the grocery and extra space has something to do with it.    Typically I am an average and reasonable Target spender (think I will spend $50, but spend $75 without really knowing how I did that).  The grocery area is Ok, but is lacking in choices -- high on the store brand-Archer Farms label, but low on healthy low-fat and premium name-brand items.  The rest of the store is high on other items -- featuring a number of clothing and housewares that wouldn't be featured at regular Target stores.  It's clean for now and like every other large store in the world, features a Starbucks, but will probably be trashed next year...lol.

Runway?  What runway?  Of course, I have no idea what everyone is talking about because I entered Canal through what I guess is the back door (no snickering kids) against the canal complete with dust and earthmovers and stuff.    Walking in through the fabulously designed space towards the back (or shall I say front) with loungey dance mix humming in the background, I spot the Yelp event going in full force.  Arriving more than fashionably late, I completely missed the appetizers, but was able to enjoy the comfortable yet sleek lounge furnishings, good company of the rad Yelpers in attendance and impeccable service of our server who remembered my Zona (tequila and guava juice - thanks for the tip Mr. K) and Bacardi cokes with A-plus student ease.  Four stars for decor Four stars for service Five stars for amazingly easy underground parking (in downtown Scottsdale?) Two stars for ease of locating said establishment  It's my kinda place.  I'm headed back to Canal for sure, hopefully entering through the right doors next time.

If you're OK braving the DMV or Walmart crowd, the October/November tradition known as the Arizona State Fair should be a breeze. Hey, I ain't above these sorts of things.  Shoot, this place oozes nostalgia that we can all relate with.  Halloween night is arguably the best night to check the fair out.  Its usual large crowd dwindles to a small but steady stream as families stay home to do the trick or treat thang.   For singles and couples that means - green light for the carnival and all sorts of artery-clogging junk food. But it also means costumed fairgoers galore, and little to no waits in line for rides.  A few cool observations: * Free parking (as opposed to $10) if you park at the State Capitol and take the shuttle buses that run every few minutes. * Expensive concessions, to be expected of course. * Asphalt-paved grounds are a nice touch for those whose allergies are aggravated by the usual grass and dust of a typical fair. * Intersting people-watching, including the 40-something costumed couple dressed as a matching nut and bolt. * Your normal selection of carnival rides include the gigantic ferris wheel plus the skyride tramway-like ride reminsicent of the buckets at Disneyland. * The Arizona Game and Fish dept. with their interactive exhibit is impressive and done well. * Shrewd and aggressive little old ladies in the culinary arts exhibit who somehow recruited me for the 2008 SPAM cooking contest.  Not quite sure how that happened, btw.  All in all, a fun and klassy time.

This is probably where I would choose to drink pre or post game in sports bar-heavy downtown.  I do agree with Mr. K and Kristin (thanks for the mnemonic device on stalactities, btw) on the decor, but I kinda like the whole variety of different looks of Silver.  Luckily we all scored a future-VIP (until the VIPs arrived, which they never did) section complete with plush leather sofa, pseudo-papa san chairs and wooden coffee table straight from Antique Roadshow.  My first visit here last week our group of 5 were of maybe 20 or so people on a Saturday night.  No DJ, no kind of energy whatsoever, BUT, the bartender came by with a complimentary pink lemonade vodka shots for us - about a $35 value.  The friends I went with aren't wine drinkers, so lucky for us they had a full bar with liquor (like Kazimierz).  Major points for that as most wine bars locally only serve beer and wine.  Last night: A lot more people, diverse crowd...but they played latin rock and salsa, probably to appeal to the Sky Loungers next door.  I do agree with Kristin that an identity crisis is going on.  They just started a boys night on Sundays...so I am sure they are probably just trying to feel out their niche.  Weak spots:  The restrooms.  Nice, but obviously not created for a bar with large crowds.  Secondly, the wine list is meager, and understandably so because it is so new.  Nothing really jumped out at me on their list.  Serious wine drinkers used to Kazimierz, Cheuvront and Postino will probably balk at this list.

Te amo invierno en Phoenix. J'aime l'hiver  Phoenix. Ich liebe Winter in Phoenix.  The winter makes me enamored so, so much so that I want to proclaim I love winter in Phoenix in romance languages.  Let's face it.  We all love this time of year as the 70 degree days makes us the envy of the nation for a few months.  Here are some additional reasons to love Winter in Phoenix beyond the obvious great weather.  * Outdoor festivals galore * Luminarias at the Desert Botanical Garden * MLB Spring Training in March * PF Changs Rock n Roll Marathon * Endless hiking opportunities * FBR Open and the Bird's Nest * Hotties from Minnesota and Chicago who are snowbirding it (I'd hit it)  And best of all... * The hibernation of Swamp-Ass until April.

London, Hong Kong, Scottsdale, people.  Yes, somehow our locale has scored enough to have this latest Roka outpost.  However, in case you didn't notice, Roka Akor is a palindrome.  Yes, I'm a word nerd.  But the food, service and atmosphere here are anything but nerdy.  I brought my friend and her vacationing Snowbird parents here and we had a great time.  The comped food and drink here ran the gamut, from delicious butterfishwhite asparagus sashimi to chicken skewers and pork and scallop dumplings, which were our favorite.  But seriously, of the five appetizer dishes and lychee martinis and French white wine nothing disappointed.  $370 for seven people was steep for my budget, but this is the sort of place my parents would like and would patronize.  I recommend it for that for sure.    Loved the space, even the distinctive restrooms.  The highlight here was the large and airy looking floor-to-ceiling wine collection behind glass cases.  The service here was extremely professional and in case you didn't notice (according to my friend Maya) the women servers here all dress and serve in 4-inch heels.  Damn Gina.

Wine service here was attentive, and table service was just as accommodating with our wishy washy group.  I was shocked, especially considering the pampered-poodleness of my friend Maya and the rest of us wanting the coveted sofa section near the dramatic giant mirror -- which we did indeed score later on at this neighborhoody bar.  You can't go wrong with the $8 La Playa Chilean chardonnay, and so agreed my Chilean girlfriend from Surprise. A Quilmes lager bottle at $6 is a bit more than I'm used to, but given it isn't served very many places is worth the trouble.  Bomberos is way north of Downtown in Sunnyslope, but is well worth the drive.  The coziness of the smallish (former fire dept) main room and the extent of the spacious outdoor patio (especially on Wednesdays) is excellent when they have a Brazilian jazz DJ.

Lame name.  Not so lame sandwiches.    I like it spicy.  Interpret that as you wish, but when it comes down to it -- it takes a lot more than spicy pickles to impress me - say gigantic and decadent choco chip cookies. Don't let the gimmicky name fool you, however, these are some serious sandwiches at Spicy Pickle, a franchise with only one location in the Valley in Chandler.  I found the quality of food and scope of sandwiches offered to be comparable to Dilly's Deli.   I had a lunch earlier this week catered from this place, and since they catered half-sized portions I was able to try two: the Santa Cruz sub and wiseguy sub.  I found the wiseguy (with italian meats and cheeses) sub to be pretty tasty, but I prefer my subs to not swim in oil and vinegar.  The Santa Cruz sub was pretty good though (and my favorite of the two) - with its ingredients of Mesquite turkey, lettuce, tomatoes, avocado, corn relish, cheddar and chipotle mayo.  The highlight of the lunch were these large thick discs that looked and tasted like chocolate chip cookies.  Crispy on the edges and moist and soft in the middle.  Seriously, one of the better cookies I have had in a long time.  BTW, the pickles are sprinkled with some kind of chili powder and are ok, perhaps they're awesome -- I don't know, I'm not a big pickle fan.

Here's why Energy gets four stars: * It's one of only a handful of Dance radio stations left in the U.S.  Phoenix bests LA, Chicago, Dallas and New York on this front.  Rawr!!  They lost their dance stations years ago. * The broadcast area goes clear up to Sedona and Flagstaff on 106 point something if you ever drive up north, you will find Energy to be the only half-decent station up that way.  I rediscovered Energy on a drive to Flagstaff a few weeks ago, and have been hooked on the station since then.   It's weird to me, because I like to hate those "types*" who listen to Energy and nothing else and they do tend to play a lot of the same house and club anthems from way-back-when to now - but that's the beauty of it too.   * I think I just offended half of my friends.  I hope they are not reading.

With the addition of Over Easy last week, 40th Street in Arcadia is becoming more and more of a hip restaurant row. Retro chairs [see photo] and space-age stools dot the interior of the cozy joint owned by Sol y Sombra chef Aaron May.  The place, which is next door to The Vig, recalls a Matt's Big Breakfast feel (and was so alluded in Java magazine) for this side of town and manages to do so in an old 1970s mission style Taco Bell.   I wouldn't have been able to tell if I didn't know. Regardless, the food here is delicious and compared to other places I did not feel like I ingested a tub of butter. I ordered the hearty Wolf Pack with a pancake on the side and I was in heaven.   Two (count them, TWO!)  layers of hash browns [see photo] with two scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese and strips of bacon in the middle. The eggs were just the right consistency and hash browns were browned just right and tasted terrific with garlic salt and pepper. A fluffy griddled pancake with syrup on the side, fresh squeezed orange juice and a complimentary New York Times at the counter also greeted my morning grumpiness and I was quickly satiated.  Altogether the meal came out to $12 + tax.  A bit pricey, but worth it knowing you get what you pay for.  I briefly talked with the chef's managing partner who went into detail about the tater tots with tomato jam (that I missed on the menu) and the bacon reduction sauce that comes with the brioche.  My only complaints would be minor.  Small quarters: With about half of the seats outside on the patio, it's probably a few seats more than MBB.  There was brisk business yesterday on a weekday morning, but on the weekend I can see how the crowds would grow.  A la carte-like menu: This is a trend I'm not particularly fond of, especially for breakfast. Several of the entrees don't come with either eggs or potatoes. The Loretta breakfast sandwich are examples of entrees that don't come with eggs. The Over Easy brioche and omelettes don't come with potatoes. The wait staff just shrugged it off as, "Oh you can just order [blank] on the side."  I disagree, especially when you're paying nearly $10 for an entre or omelette.  Semi-scattered staff:  Everyone was friendly and engaged in small talk with people at the counter.  But after asking twice for my check, I figured it was a small blip in the overall experience.  Delicious breakfast food with a cool hip feel? This neighborhood will be all over it.  I'm looking forward to the next visit.  EDIT: 1/19/08 -- OK, I'm upping this to 4.5 stars.  Service was excellent today.  And the country fries (and tater tots with tomato jam)  were outstanding.  They were deep fried with seasoned salt, parsley...yum!

Thanks to everyone who put up with all the closed roads and driving detours yesterday for the marathon.  As one of the largest marathons in the country it was really cool to see all the spectators, volunteers and bands supporting and encouraging the 34,000 runners. I finished the half marathon yesterday and the war wounds aren't nearly as bad, but I am sore as hell still.   It became clear at the startline  that we really have to do something about the Capitol complex. That area is a disaster.  Thanks for all the carb-heavy food and drink at the start and finish.  I have never enjoyed spilling hot coffee all over myself up until yesterday morning. Thanks to the UPS drivers who hauled our stuff to the finish.  The half-marathon doesn't run through the most attractive parts of Phoenix, but McDowell Road is definitely a step up from Van Buren..  That's for sure. Could you imagine thousands of runners trying to dodge hookers on their way to the finish line?  And also, thanks to the guys in my running corral who dressed up and ran as the Super Mario Bros: Mario and Luigi.  You guys rock.

Westside Girls Need Lovin Too, Part One.   So my Westside girls call me up and want to do happy hour apps and drinks, but in Surprise.  Arrrghh!!  After the initial shock, I hop in the Steveymobile and start looking forward to checkin out Surprise again.  It's been a while.  So 35 miles and 90 minutes later I roll up to an appetizer platter and margarita waiting, a stool cushion fluffed and the bar area hopping with suburbanite foodies in full force.  The bartender was very quick at the gun and seemingly busy or slammed.  He looked put out any time we asked him for a refill, a plate or a cold mug, almost to the point of dismissiveness.  The food wasn't much to crow about either.  The taquitos barely had any meat inside. The quesadillas were average. The guacamole was kind of bland.  It was very reminiscent of an El Torito or something.'  My biggest beef with the place -- a HAPPY hour that goes from 2 - 5 PM?  WTF is that all about??  There are hardly even any workers in Surprise who are able to benefit from this.  Should they rename this the Surprise Unified School District happy hour? Most people in Surprise don't even get home from their Downtown Phoenix jobs until 6.  Those are the most worthless happy hour times ever.  My Westside girls had never been there before (even though it's relatively new) and name-dropped several places there and in El Mirage that are better.  For Westside Girls Need Lovin Part Deux, I have forcefully suggested Glendale or Peoria.  Stay tuned.

Best reverse happy hour in Tempe. 4 stars is only for the bar -- not the food as my liver was in charge that night. Chronic Tacos is one of those places where things can go downhill quickly - but all in fun and cheap drinks. The $3 rockstar/vodkas were our poisons of choice. Busy, but not crowded Chronic at 9-ish was fun and likeable wih their comfortable black leather booths.  Our happy hour last week that turned into a reverse happy hour resulting in free acrobatic entertainment by yours truly on the light rail. At Chronic Tacos, just remember: buyer beware.

I got a curly brown hair in my black bean salsa here at San Felipe's.  I took Pops here for lunch and his lunch special featuring enchiladas, was just that -- enchiladas.  No rice, no beans, no eff you. Nothing.  I opted for the BBQ Pollo sandwich with avocado and "smashed papas"  basically a whole potato chunked up and fried.  The sandwich was pretty average.    The digs here are very Chuy's-like -- like your typical Mexican beach bar with festive chotchkies everywhere.  The crowd here was bleak -- maybe about 5 others in the whole place on a Thursday lunch hour.  Upon telling our server about the hair she handled the situation, but wasn't as apologetic as she probably could have been.  Lunch for us two was about $20. Two stars.

The intricate detail on the action figures of local toy creator Todd McFarlane are amazing.  I checked out the new first-ever store when I was at Westgate in Glendale and was in awe at how much the Cardinals' Matt Leinart actually looked like him.  And I do know these things.    Although the toy store specializes in action figures and looks and feels as if it's a corporate chain, this is apparently the only store and the "U.S. flagship". In addition to pro sports action figures, they also had rock bands such as KISS and the Simpsons.  Roll-up Gene Simmons tongue anyone?  I'm not even into toys or action figures and still thought it was pretty rad. It's definitely worth a visit even if just to marvel and gawk at skillz of McFarlane.

In case you're wondering, you need a passport to get into the FBR Open to prove your citizenship.  The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service recently determined that tanned, plastic looking people have in fact taken over the TPC in Scottsdale on an annual basis only to defect to their ultra-lounge havens to hibernate until the following year.   I'm really not sure what to think of this.  They speak English (but very faux surferish) and look American, but act completely juvenile, foolish and quite frankly, foreign.  Additionally, while waiting for the shuttle bus at Barcelona - ground zero for these immigrants, you can overhear the most ridiculous conversation.  Most of these immigrants started drinking at the makeshift bar in the Barcelona parking lot. One woman talked of her plan to sacrifice her bra and panties on the 16th green in her effort to score Super Bowl tickets.  Another woman (while in the bus) rated men walking down Hayden as we drove by "10!  You're a 9. You're more like a 7.  Ew, you're a 5."  The men were not to be outdone.  Who needs shuttle buses when you can just walk down Hayden, strip down to your bare, over-tanned chest while ladies driving by ask if you need a ride.  In a traditional immigrant mating call, women wore the most appropriate golf course attire they could find. On a cloudy 60 degree day many opted for mini skirts, tank tops, tacky fake Chanels, high heels and gawdy jewelry.  Men meanwhile chose over-gelled hair dos, flip flops or tube socks, shorts and Ed Hardy tees or golfy looking sweaters that they could spill their double-fisted beers all over.  Suffice to say, that was a quick synopsis of some of the crowd at the FBR. Some people actually went to watch golf, enjoy a few $7 brews on a glorious winter afternoon in Scottsdale and watch the rowdiest, drunkest spectators in all of golf boo, jeer and hiss at the 16th hole.  Greenskeeper tix and Corporate Village tix are bonus if you can land them.  This event hasn't become a national attendance breaker on the PGA circuit for nothing.  FBR Open is to Phoenix as Mardi Gras is to New Orleans. Drunken debauchery. This event has come to embody Phoenix for better or worse and as a locally grown event, from its fledgling days at the Phoenix Country Club, that says a lot.  I have a good time every time I go -- plastic Scottsdale immigrants or not.  Five stars.

This is a great hotel bar that wavers somewhere in between the ultra-clubby climes of the Scottsdale Mondrian and the refined Phoenician.  The difference here would be if the Phoenician patio contained a higher ratio of plastic platinum blonde tramps to graying platinum card holders.  Regardless of the disconnect, the element of the crowd is easily ignorable from the plain expanse of the patio bar.  It was definitely more relaxed than I expected, especially since I am very familiar with Rande Gerber's sceney bar franchises from L.A. to New Orleans to Chicago.  The setting was near perfection with an amazing late April breeze flowing through the towering four-story courtyard of the mission-style Scottsdale Fairmont Princess and dictating the night.  Servers in black identical-uniform like cocktail dresses doted on us every 10 minutes or so, refilling our Anchor Steams and pinot grigios by the glass.   While a nearby party stole our cocktail table prior to our arrival, I hadn't really noticed since the servers promptly brought us a large wooden tray to rest our drinks on the comfy white chaises.   The sheer expanse of the Stone Rose patio complete with a moat-like reflecting pool and fire pits really differentiates the space from other Gerber outposts and calms the mood from a more compact raucous surrounding to a more calm relaxing luxe outdoor lounge.

They should change their name to Fresh, Easy and Fatty.  Are you kidding me?  After all the rave reviews of Fresh and Easy,  I waited for the dust to settle and ventured there today only to find it is a major disappointment.  I find this is a view not shared by several of my friends and many trusted fellow reviewers.    From many comments I expected a Trader Hoe's type place where I would also have to stop at a Fry's to get everything else...your basics.  Well, it is that to a degree, just not as good in terms of price, quality or health as TJ's.  I have never cared for pre-packaged fruit and vegetables -- which admittedly is a criticism I have of Trader Joe's also.  I love being able to select and decide which orange is to my liking at a place like Fry's.  My biggest criticism, however, would have to be its incredibly unhealthy take-and-go food selection.  This is where TJ's has them beat.  Sandwiches all weighed in at 50+ fat grams.  An average person's total daily recommended allowance is something like 67 fat grams, so eat the sandwich reeeaaalllly slowly and savor it for the rest of the day.  For a store that prides itself on ecologically-sensitive gestures such as grocery bag recycling, organic foods, priority parking for hybrid vehicles, etc, etc., I was shocked to see how poor their nutrition facts weighed in on many foods -- making a triple bacon cheeseburger look like Lean Cuisine.  Where's the social responsibility in that?   Small 8 ounce containers of chicken salad measured at 88 fat grams and 980 calories are more offensive than slightly higher prices or the absence of ecological gestures would have been.  I mean, seriously, is there any chicken product in that salad at all, or is it just a tub of lard with chicken seasoning?  Perhaps this is some sort of sick joke the Brits are making at their fat-ass American counterparts.  I left the store with some fruit salad, organic lemonade and a spicy shrimp roll (which, btw was just as awful as TJ's sushi).  I found that the pricing was no different on many items and in many instances was more expensive at F&E.  Sorry Fresh and Easy, I don't buy it and I won't buy it.  Trader Joe's, where are you baby?  I'm a coming running back to you.

Biltmore Open, anyone?  When Brophy/Xavier MILFs aren't hustling me on the tennis courts at Granada Park, I cry myself to sleep, dream of better tennis skillz and wax nostalgic about the beauty of the rest of the park here.  Mike and I present a formidable tennis duo to the typical tennis novice, but we lack the shrill catty barbs and mesmerizing tennis skirt swoosh of the Xavier Mom. Even dog walkersby can't help but notice the competitiveness of the courts here.  Re: the rest of the park?  I'm with David on the unique and hidden appeal of Granada Park.  It's large enough to have your own peace and quiet and given its slight slope at the base of Lincoln Drive, southwest of Piestewa Peak, the setting offers a hilly landscape, ducks quacking in the ponds and views of the Central Phoenix skyline.  Quiet picnics are definitely in order here over other parks in the area.  Check it out.

I'm smitten with Maizie's.  This two month old bistro has it goin on.    * Cute trendy space, with a distinctive wine rack * Urban vibe in a Landmark Tower storefront * Neighborhoody feel * Well-rounded menu with something for everyone * Friendly service  4 stars with potential for 5. We went here for dinner on Monday.  Loved the space and decor - everything was tastefully done from the small sectional lounge area to the communal table to the small bar area (beer, wine AND liquor, btw).  It oozes neighborhood café with the small tables (seating about 30 or so) and the fact that we knew people at 2 of the 10 tables - so for a Monday night this place was hopping.  The owner Maizie and her father were a delight to talk to - answering questions we had about the menu and about the restaurant in general and checking up on us regularly.  My dining partner had the  1/2 pound bleu burger with buffalo sauce and I opted for the Santa Fe chicken Panini with a huge supple grilled chicken breast, jack cheese, guacamole and ortega chile.  The variety of sides make it possible to get creative - slaw, fruit, cottage cheese, hand cut potato French fries or noodle kugel (the sweet Jewish dish I opted for which came with raisins, cinnamon and sliced apples).   Service was good, but could be better or more seasoned.  The server who handled us was OK.  We let him know when we received the check that he had forgotten to charge us for the soda and iced tea and he went back to fix the error.  Wow.  That's a first for me.  Typically places I've been to have waived the drinks when they've already given you the check.  No big deal, just unusual and a bit gauche.  I like where they're going with the late night dining (till Midnight) and brunch service (can't wait to try the breakfast burrito).  Bring it on - I'll be back again soon to make it a regular stop.

So the crowds and general euphoria seemed to have died down since the opening of Sidebar six months ago. After more than a dozen visits to this lounge, I'm confident of my four star rating. In agreeing with what Kristin told me once, yes, Sidebar is very much what would happen if Roosevelt and Fez had a baby, at least design-wise.  The environment, decor, and drink offerings rock. A few quick notes to illustrate: * Exposed brick and stairway entry that would make any East Coaster drool.  * Cozy C-shaped booths for lounging.  * Requisite absinthe dispenser in the middle of the bar and TV screens showing old films to indicate urban trendiness.  * Kim Crawford sauvignon blanc by the glass, Anchor Steam by the bottle * White space-age-ish 4-seater tables and multi-colored LED panel thrown in for good measure.  In a few birthday parties here, I have gotten different results. For mine in January, they gladly reserved a booth for my besties and me on a Friday at 9 pm. Of course, no signage or anything, so it was a bit of a hassle to say the least as the owner, Josh, gladly asked people to move. The next month, we ran into some resistance on reserving, but were able to manage it due to our own efforts.  Overall, service has definitely improved. Although, be sure to watch your drink as ambition can get the best of them - they took away several of our half-finished glasses when we weren't looking.  One complaint to the bartender, and this was fixed.   A new and appreciated detail is their drink menu featuring some unique cocktails. One request would be to beef up their appetizer offerings.

I'm a fan.   Turf is what you get when you want an average Irish bar crossed with a high end urban pub with leather-backed chairs. This is nothing more and nothing less and has been delivered downtown to much success.  I do like that they know me and my friends already after one week, and have handled complicated car key situations, Mayor Gordon sightings with grace and easiness. Kudos them.

Camelback Ranch, the spring training home of the L.A. Dodgers and Chicago White Sox, is huge and stunningly gorgeous. It has a much different feel than a typical spring training stadium and the approach with meandering lakes, earthtone designs, elevated concourses and lush landscaping like afghan pines elicited more of an amusement park feel than anything else.  The Jumbotron, which is a welcome sight in a spring training stadium, was kind of hard to see from the left field berm, but hey, at least they have one! Similarly, the team store is spacious with both Sox and Dodger gear and is something you would expect at Chase Field. The berm seating  is sloped with comfy thick grass and sightlines weren't bad at all. So that covers the positives.  The parking situation and concession lines were terrible. The concessions are cash only, and lines that looked deceivingly small were painfully long. Granted, it was their first day and they need time to work kinks out. But they have NO DODGER DOGS! But they do have something called a Chicago Dog, ok....Regarding parking, there is only really one way in and out of their parking lots. It took nearly 30 minutes from the time we arrived at Camelback/107th Ave to when we actually parked the car, and then began a 15 minute walk to the entrance.   I loved the actual stadium facility itself, I think if parking and concessions were improved this could easily be a five star stadium.

This is the closest, newest major gym to ASU. Five stars for that alone... but there's more!  I've been working out here for more than a year now, and I LOVE IT! Having been a member with the chain for more than 10 years and having gone to about 10 or so different locations around the country, I have to say this is my favorite location of them all, and not just for its spaciousness.  Yeah, it's one year new, so of course the equipment and amenities such as the free weights, pool and basketball court are top-of-the-line compared to other 24 Hour Fitness locations. Ellipticals and other cardio equipment are plentiful and modern.  Regarding the chain itself: it's not Crunch, Golds or any of the more fancy chains, but it is accessible to the average joe and more national -- which is important if you like to work out when you travel.  The classes are average, but the Mesa location gets MAJOR points for scoring a few appearances from local Ali Vincent (winner of The Biggest Loser) to co-teach a boot camp.  And did I mention the ASU crowd that frequents this location??

I really enjoy Gallo Blanco, whether it's for brunch or lunch/dinner.  Is it a perfect experience? No way... not by any means. But it is a much better effort than what we all had to endure with C4 , Clarendon Kitchen, etc... Nothing seemed to stick.  I will say I did not enjoy being dropped on by condensation from an AC unit a few weeks ago, but that is neither here nor there, because of our large party, and because I did not formally complain to the server/management.  Every other experience has been how I like it. Servers seem a little new and lacking confidence so far. But overall, I like it. The food is decent. Not excellent, but done pretty well -- everything from the elotes to the guacamole.  I especially enjoy the brunch and the value of it. Are you really serious? $5 brunch with chorizo egg and refried beans, done just right?!  Breakfast and dinner tortas served on soft bolillos are done decently here, although the crust could be a little more tough.  Tacos are priced just right, cooked well and are worth the $2.50 each! Can't decide if I like the fish or the carnitas better. Anyhow, decide for yourself.

When my AC busted a few weeks ago I found myself staying in a suite here for the weekend.  Ok, so it's not how I usually roll, but luckily some out-of-town friends scored a suite here and my bad luck met with perfect timing to equal an over-the-top silver lining for the weekend.  The Arizona Biltmore pools alone warrant five stars, but the service and suite were nothing to look past either. The two room suite was comfortable, spacious and tastefully decorated. The living room and bedrooms had a subtle Southwestern decor that I surprisingly didn't hate.    The architecture and landscaping of the grounds was just as legendary as you would expect. Calling for extra towels was a cinch and took only a few minutes for them to arrive. The housekeeper we flagged down in the hallway gladly took photos of us on the balcony and repeatedly tried to refuse our $5 tip for his trouble. We weren't having it.  Finally, the pool experience was second to none. Like giddy school kids, the Biltmore waterslide became a 20-something playground for an hour. From what I could tell the poolside was a mix of locals and tourists as I recognized some people (incl. JohnJay from KISS 104.7).  The best part of swimming on a Saturday afternoon at the Biltmore?   * The salsa demonstration (with a dozen or so salsas and chips prepared by the sous chef) was so extensive it was our lunch!   * Swim up to the bar (or sneak your own drinks and pass it off like you bought it) and buy a $10 margarita.   * Score a cabana rental if at all possible.  You get your own private shower, bathroom, AC'ed room, umbrellas, TV, patio chairs and server.  And it is well worth it.  And....I just spilled the beans to a perfect afternoon at the Biltmore.

They had a BABY JESUS pencil topper set!!! OMG, I think I died and went to heaven.   Plus they had a photo booth and pirate cupcake wrappers, and oh yeah, they had candy. I found it to be a novelty store that happened to sell candy and other eccentric knick knacks. But whoa, what a bunch of poor reviews I see here. I found Smeeks to be a delight. The scene on a Saturday afternoon was kind of a mob scene -- about a dozen or so people kind of crowded the place.  I spent $5 on my Baby Jesus pencil toppers and found prices on other things to be just right -- it's an independent local business selling specialty goods, people.  So go ahead -- spend your money at another chain to save a buck, kwitcherbitchin and move to Buckeye. Thank you. The End.

Five stars and that's simply for the amazing 1950s formica dining set my friend scored (and that I so covet) at Retro Redux.  My latest visit revealed a magical collection of all things vintage, retro and as Calamari, states so sage-like, campy.  This is the real deal here, folks. I swear, I think my grandma's and mom's 1950s - 1970s belongings came here to die. But that's not really true, because they're getting a second life at this awesome little store on 7th Ave.  I've been to other vintage clothing/furniture stores, but they usually short on this or short on that.  There's a great mix of every style, but my favorite thing about this place is seeing old furniture just like you used to use back in the day.   I'm calling it now.  That polyester three piece suit, the tiki bar cocktail set and the 1970s egg chair are mine!

Their bread is so delicious, and being the carb-conscious nut I am, it's difficult to not devour all the bread (I don't usually). I've been to Jimmy John's in Chicago, so these subs aren't new to me, but I love that it's close by the office. Their tiny space gives an urban feel atmosphere... and it's also open late-night for all the Mill Ave barcrawlers!  I usually order the Beach Club with turkey, provolone, avocado, lettuce, tomato and cucumber. While it's considered a "Giant Club" for which you're charged slightly more, it doesn't really feel giant to me. That's my only beef with the place, their regular sandwiches must be less filling in comparison... almost scared to try them! Best thing about JJ's is when I'm broke, I'm not above walking by for FREE SMELLS!

The price is right for these street tacos, rolled tacos, tamales and Mexican hot dogs at newly-opened Tacos Atoyac. Sure, while taco shops are a dime a dozen in Phoenix, the price point and taste can't be beat. The decor is very casual and spartan for now, but the value for a typical family meal make Tacos Atoyac a steal.  The lengua, cabeza and carne asada tacos were flavorful and at $1 each, quite the value.  The black beans came to our table topped with cotija cheese and the arroz was reminiscent of any you'd find at any abuelita's house.    The "Oaxacan-style" hot dog was colorful and topped with generous helpings of sliced tomatoes, bacon bits and avocado and so very delicious.  Horchata and Mexican Coca Cola are plentiful, and the Coke priced at $1.50 is the cheapest I've seen yet at a taco shop.  Overall dinner for two was about $13, which included six tacos, one soda a spicy chicken tamale, a rolled taco and a Oaxacan hot dog. Not bad...  It's easy to find at the NE corner of Glendale Ave. and 19th Ave., next to 7-11. Can't wait to visit again, and am looking forward to having another lengua taco, hot dog and to trying the tortas!

Target Greatland - Desert Ridge.  You ROCK.  That's all there is to it.   You're clean. You're gigantic.   You're casual, yet stylish. You always have what I need.  The thought of seeing you at the end of the day keeps me going.  Your items sometimes make me laugh.  You're a cheap date.  You're everything I ever wanted in a....discount department store.  For a minute there I forgot what I was writing about.  Damn.    You have probably the biggest selection of housewares (and everything else too) of any other Target in the Valley - even better than the ghetto-ass Target I go to.  I just wish you were closer....  If you could just let me through your check-out gauntlet without spending a minimum $100, I'd LUV you even more.
