Simply put, this place has the best breakfast in Scottsdale. It's tough saying that because I like Butters a lot.   The menu is simple, and all your favorite dishes are there. do yourself a favor and order a hash...any hash. thank me later.  We went on a Sunday morning, having called ahead to make a reservation (highly recommended since they get packed). We waited about 5 minutes past our reservation time due to a large party. No biggie. Service was top notch!   The only reason this place gets 4/5 stars is they couldn't seat us on the patio even though I asked for it in the reservation.

Ordered take out on Christmas Day at around 430pm to avoid the rush. They told us we had to order from a pared down menu which was probably the first sign we should have passed and gone somewhere else.  I could understand having the limited menu during the rush, but there was none.  When we got to the restaurant there was one person in front of us. we waited over 15 minutes past the time our order was supposed to be ready.   We basically wasted about $100 on food that day. All of it had zero point zero taste. it's like they ran out of seasoning or something. plus every protein was over cooked!   I didn't even bother trying to get a refund because they probably would have offered store credit. Since we're never going back there's no point.   I really don't know how this place has an average rating of 4.   the only reason they get a 1 is because the food was packaged nicely.

OMG. This place is a total hidden gem up in Cave Creek. I'll keep this short and sweet.  1. sit outside near the golf course 2. order the root beer braised short ribs 3. order a burger 4. if you're going with a large party get the salsa assortment for an appetizer.  This is a perfect date place. It's quaint, has the ambience of Lon's for a fraction of the cost. IMO, their service is in the top 5 of all restaurants I've been to in Arizona. There's no way you can go wrong with Tonto Bar and Grill.

5* without batting an eyelash. food is amazing, service is amazing! I had the cheesesteak with all the fixins. ridiculous portions, fresh veggies, lots of cheese, fresh bread. other folks had the Italian, and a ham/cheese sub which they all said was awesome. the table shared the calamari which was solid. you know it's good when you get mini squids, large pieces of squid, and not those silly mini rings. can't wait to go back and try the pizza, wings, and pasta!

My wife and I visited this locally owned establishment on a  Sunday afternoon in August prior to a d'backs game.  We had visited Churn several times in the past (an artisan ice cream shop that's connected to Windsor), but never got around to dining at Windsor.  So we got there around 11am, and it was busy...20 minute wait busy.    To kill time we browsed the menu and noticed a couple of things.  First, happy hour...they have $5  drinks until 5pm everyday.  We're not talking well either.  They have a solid selection of craft beers, and eclectic cocktails.    After a few minutes a couple seats at the U shaped bar opened up so we took those instead of waiting for a table.  What a great move on our part.  The bartenders are great people and like to hang out and talk.  Plus when you need help understanding some of the ingredients in their cocktails they're right there to answer any questions.   My wife ordered the No. 22 and absolutely loved it.  I tasted it and although i'm not into the fruity drinks, this one was refreshing and flavorful.    I ordered a Deschutes Mirror Pond to kick things off, and then followed up with the No. 63 based on the recommendation of the bartender.  At first I was leaning toward the No. 87 which i'll try next time.    Food....we started with the cheddar fondue appetizer.  I'll warn you, this is a meal by itself.  It's served with fresh apples, sausage, and soft pretzels.  The fondue had tons of flavor and even a little spicy kick.    After gorging on the fondue we could have stopped, but for whatever reason I was still hungry.  We chose the Grilled Chicken Sandwich with sides of fried okra and chopped kale salad.  If you like spicy you'll love the sandwich.  It has a curry rub, along with a spicy jalapeno mayo.  Plus the bread seemed rather fresh, but I'm not sure if they make it in house (maybe they get it from a local bakery...dunno).  While dining we looked around to take in the full experience.  The restaurant has a rustic feel, but the patio is where it's at.  I can't wait for the temps to cool so we can go back and chill with friends on the patio.  Oh yeah...and grab some ice cream at Churn.  Don't forget to check out the cassette tape wall!

I had wanted to try OTF for quite some time, and finally pulled the trigger.  My initial reaction to walking through the door with all the trainers sitting around was a bit overwhelming, but everyone was welcoming and friendly.  I went around 11am to fill out paperwork, get the lay of the land, and ask some questions about membership/packages.  Anthony was extremely helpful answering all my questions, and I felt very comfortable for when I came back at 315 for the class.  The class itself is intense! In 54 minutes I burned 765 calories spending 22+ minutes in the orange/red zone (According to the instructor the goal is to be between 12 and 20 minutes in those zones).  Anyway, back to the class...we did what's called a tornado where we rotated between the treadmill, weight room, and rowing machine with a focus on short bursts of high intensity followed by recover (i.e. HIIT).  Randy, the instructor, was welcoming and helpful just like the rest of the staff I met.  He was extremely motivational making sure I was getting the most out of the workout, running through the exercises more than once for me, and helping with my form.     What's also great is that the rest of the people in class become a team, and help motivate each other.  At the end of the class the location manager got us all together for a class photo!  It truly is a unique experience.  As of now I'm 20-25 lbs away from my goal weight so there's definitely a lot of work to do.  I didn't want to commit to the month-to-month membership since I wasn't sure how many classes I could do a week so I purchased a pack of 10 classes.  My plan is to go once a week (until the 10 classes are used) as a supplement to my regular gym workouts, and then reevaluate to see if I should do a monthly membership, or purchase another pack of classes.  The only negative I experienced was trying to figure out which direction to go regarding membership.  I asked about price matching promotional rates for the new McCormick Ranch club, but they couldn't do that.  Then I asked about the basic membership (4x/month) which is advertised on the OTF website, but that wasn't available at this location.  There was a bit of a push to go with the Premier package (8x/month), but I didn't want to commit to that right now as I felt that if I didn't go 8x/month that I'd be wasting money.  The process seemed kinda strange to me which is why I went with the 10 pack of classes.    Overall I had a great experience, and the entire staff is fantastic.  I can't wait to do my 2nd class next Friday!

not impressed with the old town location. the service was poor, the burgers weren't cooked to temperature (asked for medium rare, but they brought out well done). really...a burger place that can't cook burgers?!?!   the only good take aways are   1. solid beer selection, both draft and bottles 2. tons of televisions well placed throughout 3. good happy hour specials  the only way I'd ever go back is for happy hour to get a few hard to find beers.

excellent repair shop!  we had them replace a broken iPad screen, and it was done in under a couple of hours for a fraction of the price of other stores in the area.   granted, they don't use Apple screens, but the OEM spec replacement is high quality. we haven't had an issue with function.

absolutely amazing! do yourselves a favor and go to twisted grove now! we started with a bruschetta assortment, and then moved onto the cavatelli, short ribs, and twisted noodle salad.   you know an establishment takes pride in their food when the presentation grabs your eye. bright colors, perfectly cooked beef, fresh pasta, fresh gnocchi, house made bacon, the works. pro tip...get the sunny side up egg on the cavatelli.  we finished the meal with the cookies (fresh baked) and chocolate milk (some concoction of chocolate yummyness). you have to get this! pro tip...don't let your 2.5 year old get a hold of the milk. it was gone in a matter of seconds  we had a fantastic server which made the meal even more enjoyable.   note...they have an extensive beer and wine list which I appreciated.   another note...they have a solid kids menu, but it's not printed. the server will list it off for you. we got the Mac n cheese, French fries, and veggies. it's served on a plate with separate compartments which is perfect for the kiddos.  can't wait to go back!

I'm not a big coffee drinker, and don't visit very many coffee shops. A coworker wanted to try this place out (it's pretty new I guess) so we swung by.   I ordered a medium coffee with cream and sugar, but only got coffee with cream. There is music playing in the background, and the person who took my order couldn't hear me very well. She was super nice though so that made up for the minor mishap. Our order was processed super fast which was nice.  The coffee is really smooth (didn't have the burnt taste you get at Starbucks), and they put in the perfect amount of creamer (remember I'm not a big coffee person).   I was pretty pleased with the experience and quality of coffee. I definitely like it better than the stuffy/smug atmosphere in many other coffee shops around town. It's convenient to my office so I'll go back whenever I need a caffeine fix.
