I don't even know where to begin. Ive never had a bad sandwich. Tried many different ones. My favorite one is the kgb. It's amazing. Try the purple haze beer. The home made rice crispy treats. Oh my God and the drink selection.. they have TANG ON TAP!  LOVE THIS PLACE!

Ive been coming to this place for years. They have taken care if all my rescued pups.  DR. Wendy Holst and staff are super friendly. Out of the many visits, there was only one time that I felt I had to wait. Overall never had a bad experience. My rotties have always loved this place, pitties not so much. I love this place. And will keep on returning when my pups need too.

Excellent sammiches. Plain n simple, delicious. As good as jimmy John's but this place has nothing on CHEBA HUT.   The sandwiches are tasty, price is ok. This place beats subway any day.

Excellent place, super friendly staff. It's under construction.. remodeling it but still much better selection than "neighborhood Wal-Mart" for healthier organic foods.

This place sucks for customer service. Their organic selection is NON EXISTENT! the store closes at midnight I tried to come in at 1145pm one night and they denied me. Lines are always backed up. Avoid this place.

If Im in the mood for wings, I come here. You can't beat their dozen wing, fries, n drink combo. They have some really good subs also. They could upgrade their tvs tho, and play the ufc fights.

I love this place. It's down the block from my job, but it closed down.  Oh sad times. Now the hunt for organic lunches near mesa Riverview.

I've never had a bad experience at a rubios. The fish tacos are amazing. Along with with steak Baja bowl. All in all the service at this place is always quick and friendly. Try taco Tuesdays..

Been to this place a few times now. The food is great. Staff is friendly. I love how the place has been converted from an old gas station to a burger joint. This last time around I had my pups with me hanging out on the patio. Everyone loved them. Ill make it a point, when I'm out in north Phoenix to visit this place.

The place is entertaining. I usually come here cause of the free ufc fights. Food is pretty good. I haven't had anything I didn't like just yet. We usually stay a little after the fights. I'm not very country (from Brooklyn ny) so we usually get some glares cause everyone is usually wearing cowboy hats, tight jeans, flannel button downs and huge belt buckles. It's an ok place every now n then. But a great place to watch the ufc fights.

I've been to these places a few times. Food is great. Staff has been friendly. I love this one because the first Tuesday of every month, they donate 20% of the check to M.A.I.N. (Medical animals in need) a place that rescues  animals from the pound/shelter that need medical attention. So five stars in my book.

I really don't like the service of this place. The only reason I come here is cause of the comedians. The food is mediocre at best and way expensive. Drinks are even more expensive. I usually try asking for a booth rather than sit at a crowded table, and its like pulling teeth. They did change their seating, which is better now. But I still cringe when I think about coming to this place but I do it for certain comedians. I miss the old Tempe improv (before it reopened)

Poor customer service. Waited in line with 5 other customers, while 5 employees didn't even acknowledge one single customer. One of them was the store manager. His name was Ruben. This place is a joke.

Ive been to a few different thrift stores with the girlfriend, and this one smells like the rest of them. We have found and bought a few different items at the epic store. It's the girlfriends favorite.  the  staff  is  friendly. helped  us  load  and  all.

I've eaten here a number of times. Tried a bunch of different omelettes and burgers. The volcano burger was amazing. Their breakfast buffet is delicious also. The bar service was really good, great drink selection.  I must say I was impressed for a hotel restaurant.
