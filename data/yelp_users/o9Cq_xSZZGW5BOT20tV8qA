I wish I would've found them sooner. If you are like me, your "pet" is not a pet, but your family. When my Kaysee became sick, I took her to Banfield just up the street from these guys. Don't do that. The staff here were really quick & kind when I called about letting my fur baby go. She was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lymphatic cancer & her legs and other parts of her body began to swell. She was so kind hearted & strong willed that she wouldn't give up despite her condition. She was so frail, she hardly looked like the same dog. Kaysee was my companion for 12 years. I already miss her, but am glad she is not in pain and finally at peace. It was one of the most emotionally traumatic experiences of my life hearing her yelp and scream, but I knew she was scared more than anything else when she was injected. I wish I would have taken her here initially so that I would have been given more direction as to when to truly let go. Banfield never said she is in pain and not to prolong it. They took $800+ for tests & pain meds. They just wanted to keep pumping her with medications.  Again, wish I would have found these guys sooner. The vet there is a really really nice guy.   Did not talk in circles like Banfield's vet. He was clear, concise, and tried to be as accommodating as one could be in that situation. I am going through tough financial times, but did not want to have her dumped in a landfill. I chose to pay for a group cremation which was $65. The whole process was about $170.00 for the office visit, euthanasia, and mass cremation. I'm happy to eat bologna sandwiches everyday so Kaysee didn't have to suffer anymore.  My heart is so sad but Im thankful that Kaysee isn't struggling to hang on.

Usually this is a good location. I actually drive out of my way past another wendys to get to this one. My chili was not hot nor was the container filled. My nuggets were old and stale. Very disappointed after this visit.

I usually take my pets to an old fashioned small family owned private practice. My older pet (11 years old) has been experiencing some problems so I called to make an appt. I needed to get in fairly quick. I spoke with Rebecca, who was very pleasant and stated she could be seen the very next morning. I arrived at 8:30am, and checked-in. My appt time was at 8:40am, I was kept waiting until 9:10am before I was brought into a room. There are 6 rooms total from what I could see, there were TONS of vet techs walking around and they just seemed "too busy" to truly connect with me or my pet.  A vet tech came in to go over my concerns, it was brief, maybe 7 minutes maximum. Then the vet came in, she was very nice and courteous with my pet. She did a quick evaluation, again maybe 7 minutes maximum. About 5 minutes later the vet tech came back in with an estimate of $740 for blood work and xrays.   I am happy to pay for my pets needs, as she is my family and she deserves the best. I unwillingly decided I would leave my pet there for testing. I returned later that day and was shown an xray of my dogs abdomen. I was told she could under-go an exploratory surgery to find out truly what the problem was, which she is old and I would never do that to her unless there is truly a purpose. I am not ok to surgically open up my elder dog for you to explore. No thanks.  I was told her spleen and/or liver could be problematic causing her symptoms. When I went to pick up my pet, all the staff told me how cooperative and sweet my pet was. And even allowed them to take samples (poking her with a needle without being numbed) with no response, just tried to bury her head next to them.   I was told to wait for the lab work to come back before making any decisions, which at this point. They hadn't even given me a prognosis or any indication of what could be causing this swelling in her tummy. I paid $800 for blood work, a cytology test, 1 xray of her abdomen and 20 pills of medication. (Just to give you an idea of their pricing)  I was given a call today (one day later) and the person who called to check up called my pet by the wrong name. And then said we don't have the results yet, just wanted to check in on her. Nice gesture, but perhaps getting the name right & true genuine feeling behind your voice would be nice during this trauma.  Overall, they are generally nice but I will not continue to utilize this place for my pet  they currently saw, or my other pet. I prefer a place with more connection, genuine care, and heart-warming understanding that pets are not just pets but family.....at least to me. That is the reason for the low star review...strictly based on if I would take my pet back or recommend to others, and No..I would not.

After my first poor experience, I called the vet who initially saw my pet Dr. Thomas. She would not give me a direct answer and told me she would write me an ongoing script for pain meds. I'm SO glad I went to another vet's office right down the street because that vet informed me your dog is REALLY sick. I would never ever set foot or recommend anyone who loves their animals like children to go here.

Love Fez. Their food presentation is beautiful, the atmosphere is very eclectic & unique. The food is always fresh and although it can get busy at times, the waiters do seem to do their best to stay on top of it. Only downfall is parking can be tough!

Love love love this place. Sure it is in an old shopping plaza and nothing else worthwhile is in it besides Phong's BUT this is seriously the BEST nail shop. I have gone to countless and they are all quick money, get you in, get you out as fast as can be. I have my nails done by Phong only, just my preference. Very nice and accommodating. And yes also free water bottle service!

HEALTHY, FRESH, DELICIOUS, & INEXPENSIVE Fresh hummus, fresh pitas, fresh chicken, fresh produce....literally I cannot say FRESH enough. I have been to this location probably at least if not more than 10 times and EVERY time the food is spot on. If I am in a rush, I inform the server and they get me in and out no problem (even if it is during a busy lunch rush). Very accommodating and I have never not one time had an issue here. The server usually always asks me if I want a to-go drink.   I think I maybe had ONE less than desirable experience and that was when the server was too busy flirting with the women at a table for 10minutes. I literally had to get up & say Hi, I need my check. Then he stood there and talked for 5 minutes more which irritated me to all hell. But it has not kept me form going back. If I got him again as a server, I would just ask to be sat at another section.

So I'm a little disappointed to say the least. I got my eyebrows done yesterday by Denise.The lighting was poor in the room that I received my permanent makeup done in, which could have impacted the quality.  My brows were previously done with a hair stroke technique a year ago in California by Sheila Bella (which reviews and photos are posted from that visit as well). Denise went over what was there because it had "blurred" and no longer looked like individual hair strokes, so I decided to just get it redone the "regular way" and save myself a mini fortune.   About 5 hours after my procedure I looked on the mirror after I showered and noticed the tail wasn't finished on my right brow. I asked Denise the following morning if she could complete and she said it would be $30 additional 30 days later. I don't think it's fair to charge clients if the work wasn't finished initially. This isn't a touch up but actually finishing the tail correctly. I bought a Groupon for the service but did tip and would have come back for a touch up and pay if needed, but as a professional whom has been in that industry myself, I would never make a client pay for my inability to finish the job correctly the first time. My employees even commented that they were not even, which was unfortunate.  UPDATE: I spoke with Denise today who stated it was a misunderstanding in communication and that she would fix my eyebrows free of charge. She then confronted me about this Yelp review. Which is an honest, unpaid, and unbiased review from a paying customer. She stated that her friend told her I wrote a bad review about her. I wrote an HONEST review as a paid customer, who tried to resolve the issue before writing my review! Denise had the audacity to ask me to take this review down! I also complained to Groupon about this, and read the other reviews for the Tijuana Tan, which are not so hot. Now, I feel like the only reason I was even offered this "free" touchup was because I did write this review, and I will not let anyone who has ill feelings about me do a permanent service on me.   Every person matters, and every person paid to walk thru the door.

I LOVE this location! I love Chipotle to being with. But in regards to this particular location I felt the need to write a review simply because I drive out of my way to get here. I live near Norterra, and that location is less than desirable when it comes to staff & portions so I drive to this location. The staff are always SUPER nice & the portions are the BEST. They do not chince out like the one at Norterra. They give you a full scoop of rice and beans, not a half like other locations. They are usually always accommodating as well. I usually get a Carnitas Bowl, and had big chunks of fat instead of meat, and put it on a napkin and walked back in and said, "Could I perhaps have a little meat? I got some yucky fat chunks" They apologized and gave me actual meat.  I wish Chipotle would have kept the yellow corn instead of the white because the flavor was WAY better but oh well. I still love Chipotle and love this location. I will go back time and time again. Love Love Love.

Holy Smokes this place is GOOD! No, it is freaking AWESOME! I am a HUGE pho fan, and eat it practically once a week. I noticed this place was opening and came across the yelp reviews. So I decided it was worth a try. For one, the place is aesthetically pleasing. It doesn't look like a shop that was transported from Vietnam, like the usual place with small tables, cheap/poor decorations, and looks run down. This place is clean yet traditional. I ordered the shrimp spring rolls, which I've had in different states all over the U.S. These were the best. My BF who isn't die hard about the rolls ate one and said they were amazing. And he travels to Guam, Hawaii, and lots of other places. I got the Pho, and it was the best I've ever had. Fresh, the broth was delicious and really carried the flavors of the star anise. It was SO good, I just went yesterday and want to go back today! I also got a Taro Boba, which i've been obsessed with since I lived in Hawaii. Nobody here, in my neighborhood, has been able to make an amazing boba. Again, my BF drank half of mine and he doesn't even like boba! SOOOO GOOD! *The only thing I could see them improving is maybe adding a TV in their little bar area. And that's just a personal preference. Their food is AMAZING. The staff and owners are really nice. I couldn't understand one of the waiters but he was still very nice.

Where do I even start? I've been in business for over 11 years, and exposed many different companies in the aesthetics industry. These girls have it DOWN! If you compared (which it's hard to do) Bodify to their competitors in the same format we rate hotels, they would give you the experience you would expect getting a room at The Phoenician. Every single detail did not go overlooked when they created this place.  If you are interested in CoolSculpting, this is the place to go. The are very responsive within 24 hours, without being invasive, demanding or pushy. The exude a warm demeanor, even under frustrating circumstances and project a positive atmosphere for you to receive your treatment. The rooms are beautifully decorated, accommodating to your needs while you would be in treatment, and provide you with a complimentary coffee and/or meal. This is the "world class" experience most places promise you but fail to deliver. And with their results guarantee, you know they are there for YOU, the paying customer. That is ethical and responsible business right there, that you rarely see. Classy, Elegant, Sophisticated, and business smart. Schedule a consult with them, and experience everything I say here.
