The flavors are amazing and you can order to your heat taste.  I have never left there with an empty tummy, actually I always leave with leftovers. And now that I have been to a few local and different Thai places this one ranks one the best. Just down the street is Thai Elephant and I found there flavors were not as enjoyable as Thai Basil. Hit this place up and get the Pad Thai or the Panang curry.

I went with a large group of people (around 13) for a friends birthday party. Our server was amazing and took very good care us. Everything came out at once and all the orders were correct! The food was nothing but perfect! When you go you have to order the sweet potato fries. They come out hot and smelling like Thanksgiving's marsh-mellow covered yams. Sweet and yummy they are a new addiction.  The simple modern atmosphere is a great place to relax, listen to music and sip on your martini. I can't wait to go back.

It's warm, open, and very comfortable. The food is FANTASTIC! Order up the Baked Goat Cheese. You will be asking for a second order of it, it's that good. I loved everything about this place, from the free valet parking to the concept of fresh food cooked on a brick oven, everything was perfect from start to finish. The place was packed and I was there for dinner on a Thursday night. Also try this place out for a great date night. It has a wonderful urban romantic feel at night.

In the middle of the big city it is really hard to find a peaceful outdoor space to escape. But now I know all I need to do is swing by Morning Glory and the rest of the farm.   My group of 6 arrived at 10:30am for brunch on a Saturday. The place was PACKED! Always a good sign I say. We waited about 1/2 hour to get our table but time flew by with conversations and relaxing/taking in the scenery of the farm. Once seated we all pulled out pens and drew all over our butcher paper table cloth. Us 20/30 something year olds turned into 7 year olds drawing all over the table.   Our service was great! For as crazy busy as they were everything came out tasting wonderful! I ordered up the eggs benedict. All of the egg dishes use the farms eggs from chickens you can see for yourself just a few yards away. Yum yum! I also got to sample some of my friends applewood smoked bacon. OMG! This bacon will make you drool for more! In her words "They really smoke it with real apples!" hehe One of the best parts of the meal that really impressed me was that they have a self serve station for water, tea and coffee. I liked not having to wait for our waitress to bring me more water or coffee I could just jump up and get it myself.   Don't try to make this a quick stop for breakfast or brunch. Plan to spend the morning or afternoon there and take in the relaxing outdoors, the restaurant, farm and to local shopping just steps away. Enjoy and relax!

This is a very trendy and comfortable coffee house. I spent hours their today and it was my first time in. The menu is nothing but the basics, lattes, espresso, mocha, and fresh brewed to order cups of coffee. It's unique because they brew each cup of coffee when you order it. It doesn't sit in a coffee still for hours waiting to be pored then consumed, so in other words the coffee never tasted "burnt." If you have some time to kill and need a creative place to sit then stop in.

SO YUMMY! If you want a chance to try it with out fear go for lunch. The portions are smaller so it takes some of the fear out of trying something new and different. Now that is not to say that you wont be going back to the office with an empty tummy, you will be leaving full and satisfied and craving it! My suggestion is order up the #32 and thank me later. :)

It's small, modern, retro, dark, intimate, and at times pretty romantic. Oh and they serve up some mean cocktails! Try the CenPhopolitain super fruity and a great tribute to Central Phoenix. This place played great music and the service was pretty fast for being as busy as they were. Check out this loft of a bar and you'll have a great time!

I usually go to the location at City North but I was in the area and stopped into the ASU location. The vibe is the same but they have a much larger selection of yogurt flavors! I served up the banana and chocolate topped with strawberries and oreos. OMG yummy!

This grade is not biased on the food or service. Both were wonderful. This is biased on the fact that they have an out dated policy that they will not slips checks. Personally it's 2015, you should be able to split checks. It doesn't sound like a big deal but it really is to your customers. So if you're planning on enjoying an outing with friends plan on doing some math, splitting one bill between cards or taking on the whole check yourself.
