The following is honest fact about Carefree by someone with several years experience with high and low end tan establishments in AZ and California.  Note: I am not affiliated with this family or establishment in any way, nor am I receiving any benefit for this review.  Doing the right thing   01)  Honestly best value in area, (and further), friendly quality service, lower pricing, an upper classification look and feel establishment. More than just tanning services ie. cosmetics, massage,waxing and more.   02)  No hidden costs. What they show on brochure is what you pay; taxing included.        03)  Members contract is first 3 months, cancel contract by the the 25th of any month thereafter with  no penalty,  billing 1st of the month.  04)  Going out of town?, 10 dollars a month to keep membership going or just   cancel as stated above and rejoin.   05)  Family friendly operation that will listen and respond to any concerns.   06)  Two office suites of beds and equipment, eliminates chance to have to wait. Ask about busy times, not really necessary, should fit anyone's schedule. My wife was bugged by them closing for a few months during the summer on Sunday's due to slow season for tanning.. You solve that by paying their competition and get less but benefits, but you will have Sunday's for those few summer months.  07)  Soft towels, robes to walk to and from for more than one type session while there.  08)  Three (3) levels of the Automated Mystic,  Members get maximum generous discount on them. Longer and darker results with my findings and skin. They offer qualified experienced persons to  spray you at a slightly higher rate for the customized requests and special occasion needs.This full rate without any discount is" less than half the price of high end Resort Spas" which charge 90+ dollars.   09)  Array of Equipment which seems and claims to be kept up to or above industry specifications.  10) Clean sanitized environment, bathroom included.  11) Current Industry-certified persons qualified and available to answer any concerns or questions.  I don't know what else you could really want from a tanning store, but I'm good with it, I am sure if you ask they may have a good answer.

Everyone has their own life experiences. My dealings with them might be different than yours. In not leaving feedback as a benefit for them to grow since i havnt found management to be involved anyway.

Terrible service is what I hear and concur, pushy bad attitudes, and workmanship! On Facebook in Anthem the walls are flooded with dissatisfaction and complaints. People are so mad they don't even want to take the time to notify top of pyramid management and owners because it would be doing them a favor to know.  Let them sink slow. If you go I hope you come out undamaged. Alot of others haven't  I hate giving bad reviews but Im doing it for a good deed to others that will be inconvenienced going to another wash.
