Great experience! Saw Kelly, Owner, and he was GREAT! I love my Brazilian blowout. Kelly had great attention to detail and took time to explain the steps as he went through the process since it was my first one. A nice added bonus was the cut was included in the Brazilian Blowout. As for the salon it has a fun, funky, 70s rocker vibe. The staff was very friendly and I will definitely return!

I love love this place! Eyebrow threading is my preference and the girls here do an amazing job. Not once have I had any issues. Toni is my favorite but they're all really quick, precise and good at what they do.

I'm very upset at the way my parents were treated here this weekend.  If you want to be racial discriminated and treated poorly this is your place to go. It's embarrassing to have them visit (from out of state) our home here in Phoenix  and be treated as though they're not good enough to get quality and timely service. You would think in this day and age that a black man and white woman would get the same respect as anyone else. To make matters worse no one bothered to apologize or even at least comp their meal. I cannot believe that my daughter will have to be prepared to face this kind of behavior. I will NEVER eat here in the future and hope no one else supports them either.

The location and patio are great but I had poor service. We had to go find our own napkins and silverware. Our waitress would disappear for long periods of time not refilling our drinks. The food took an hour to get out to us and was poorly put together. Overall I was disappointed.

Went to Rachel today for a trim and blow out for the first time. She's great! She was right on time and was super friendly. I was very pleased with my cut and Brazilian blow out! I would definitely refer my friends to check her out and look forward to seeing her again in 6 weeks!

Kayce is an amazing person and trainer.  I went to her last year to get into shape and feel my best. She actually cared about my week to week changes and diet as much as I did. She kept the workouts fun, interactive and ever changing so you were never bored.  Not only did I see results and improvements within 2 months but she had completely changed my views on health and fitness.  I would highly recommend Kayce to anyone who needs a little push, great diet advice and a new perspective on working out!
