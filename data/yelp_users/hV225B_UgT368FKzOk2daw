I have been in many different storage companies units since moving from NJ to AZ in 1998.   I have to put it out there and bless these people as this place is the best of the best.  choosing therm to protect my stuff, I was in a bubble of God's love being there.    ~My stuff was completely safe and accessible.  ~Their structures are maintained all the time so there was no surprise flooding, bugs or damage.  ~They worked with me when I hit a low in my life to stay current on my rent.  ~They treated me like family.  ~They do very low and predictable rent increases annually so I wasn't ever burned like ShurGaurd and others have done to me.   ~They cared about my needs and gave me a unit near an electrical outlet so I could be in my unit and have extra lighting to see all my fabrics and trims.   It is a huge endeavor moving my stuff into storage. I learned how vulnerable I am by  being burned by bad valued, greedy storage facilities and it made me aware of those things that bring peace to the heart in this decision.  Connie, Steve and their team rock in my book!

I JUST LOVE THIS PLACE! It smells incredibly GREAT!  It's the only organic hotel I know here and I feel healthy being in it. The colors are beautiful and zen-ful. It is so cool that this hotel embraces all the elements... Earth, water, wind and fire. Being the Chief Pet Pamperer of Arizona I give it a huge thumbs up for bringing your pet there. Their chef is AMAZING and he cooks special meals for your dog or cat. The people food is out of this world wonderful too!    This place is a hidden gem and a must go to!

Our family is so disappointed in the downgrade happening in Fresh and Easy. Nothing worse than a price increase and a quality decrease at the same time!   I got my fiance hooked. I loved Fresh and Easy. I started shopping at one by my high-rise in Central Phoenix and then relocated to Greenway and the 51. We love high quality products and found some great ones at Fresh and Easy.  This morning I gagged drinking my coffee. We have been buying their half and half for about 8 months. We were buying 5 quarts a week. It tasted like I used whole milk instead of my creamy wonderful coffee. I looked at the label and sure enough. The label now says milk with cream. My guess by the taste is they waived the cream over the top and added a tablespoon.  Last week they reduced the size of our favorite coconut cookies. We were buying 2-3  a week to a package that is 75% the size of the original one. Last month they changed their sour cream and put the words "all natural ingredients" boldly on the cover  and it couldn't be farther from the truth. It barely has any cream in it. They were charging $1.15 for the longest time. Then jumped up to $1.35 and then down graded from Cream and culture to a chemical blend.   We loved their tortilla chips until they another could be oil Canola oil which in research was the cause of mad cow disease and is a bug killer and totally detrimental to your health.    Check this out.  RAPE IN A DIFFERENT GUISEhttp://www.living-foods.com/board/read.php?f=1&i=21641&t=21641 In looking at the ingredients through out Fresh and Easy they are downgrading rapidly to low quality no reason to shop there but to say hi to the great staff kind of place.  One door is closing for us and Costco is regaining our business back by offering high quality organic foods and to die for half and half for only pennies more than were were paying Fresh and Easy.   We are very bummed out for the layout, staff and selection verbiage at least is aligns with our family mission statement.   So I write today with hopes they put the skids on their down grading quality. I want the world to know their products are tasting weird. Even their whole milk is tasting compromised. It doesn't have a fresh taste.  Sadly many of Fresh and Easy's products that once were great are getting gross.  Our family would really pay the price increase and have the same great quality and quantity.  We feel downgrading the quality and raising the price is deceitful and dishonest not to mention a potential toxic addition to our all ready overloaded with toxins world.

Being from NJ I am always on the prowl for my hometown pizza and Italian food. They have absolutely the best cannolis like my grandmothers!  The pizza droops like Ray's Pizza in NY. I'm not a big fan of sauce that has any sugar in it which most do so to many their sauce is awesome. I prefer unsweetened everything.  The service is great and they are from New Jersey!  It's a great place to grab their special 2 slices and a coke for $4! YUM!

Looking a cutting edge, wanting the best for everyone type of pet boutique you must go to Oliver and Annie's.   Chris, the owner is amazing! He knows his stuff and has the best of the best. There is no pet boutique like his. Urban chic and healthy top draw. He is an amazing supporter of local artists and designers and an absolute delight to know and do business with. His loving nature is endearing!   It's no surprise he just received the "Best of Phoenix" award.

We ate there last night and it was so delicious, fresh and hot!   My companion had a hamburger  with cooked green chilies, pepper jack and the works.   It was on one of the Fudrucker like buns. Smooth, dome like and perfect to melt in your mouth. He was break dancing eating it. I ordered their excellent fried chicken I am sure Chef Ramsey would like! I picked homemade mashed potatoes and beans which were excellent.  It is a great very reasonably priced rustic down home place. They have a million TV's going and last night I watched 2 football games, poker, Nascar and something else, I forget.   If you have been dragging your feet like I have to pop in, don't delay. They are on the fringes of closing after a rough summer.  I would hate to see this wonderful landmark of Arizona with their fun signs, log-ular furniture, great food and love filled great customer service, fade away.   The owners of the Bell location are the original chef and waitress of the Original Satisfied Frog founded in Cave Creek. They put it on the map up there.

All eyelash places aren't equal and this place is a 10 in my book!  I have been obsessed with wanting eye lashes noticing them on many of my clients for a while now. They make everyone so pretty!   So I tried one place and they put on clusters which lasted less than a week that were so painful from too much glue.   I found @ Lash and they save the day! They removed the few sprigs left which I called shooters, LOL! and put on individual ones with surgical glue in 2 phases. I had the first application and 2 days later a fill of shorter ones to make them look natural.  I cannot believe how my prettier I look and feel. They are holding up really well too! The gal that does them is such an upbeat spirit too! I cannot wait to go back.  I think their prices are great.  They offer a package of 4 fills ($25 each) for $100 which is excellent!  Their salon is super cozy and cute too. Black and white in animal prints with red accents.   While I was laying there 3 different clients dropped in just to say hi because they were in the neighborhood. What great Karma I thought.   Warning... do not open your eyes to see anything during the process like I did! The fumes of the glue will get you!
