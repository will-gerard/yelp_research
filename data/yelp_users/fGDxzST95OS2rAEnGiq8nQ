Decided to try this small Hawaiian spot. Walking up to the counter the ladies were all super friendly. I got the teriyaki chicken to go, which service was surprisingly fast and great portion for the price. The presentation even for the food to go was really nice, not to mention everything tasted super fresh!!! I will defiantly be back!!!!!

It was a Saturday about 5pm when My wife 2 boys and I walked in and there was only a few other groups in the restaurant. We asked if they had margaritas and the waitress said they only had margaritas In a pouch which seemed odd. We ordered our food and 30 mins later we noticed they were just bringing out another group's food. We asked the waitress about our food and she said it was going to be another 15 minutes. We told her that was too long and we would just leave. The owner walked it and didn't say one word to us. As we were walking to our car we noticed the owner taking to bags of food out to his vehicle. I would suggest never going here!

I was there for business and staying across the street at the Hard Rock. It was our last night and we finished up at the trade show and needed a place to eat. The Bell Hop told us to go here. I had Salmon which was honestly the best I have ever had. My coworker had filet minon and He said it was incredible. The waiter was knowledgable but seemed too busy flirting with a couple girls instead of checking in on us. I would recommend this restaurant.

We were staying at the HardRock and decided to go down and eat here. I had some many tacos which seemed reasonable but once I started eating I felt something odd and realized it was a fingernail from my taco. I showed my coworkers and they all wouldn't finish their food. Once I showed the manager she wasn't even really apologetic. They comped my main course but made me pay for everything else. I understand things happen but what turned  me off was the lack of customer service

The girl that helped me today was not helpful and was super rude. I will not come back to this location.

My wife and I had a break from the kids so we came here for a late lunch. It was relaxing and as always the food was so good!!! We ordered the cherry blossom roll, jalape√±o roll, and the sushi creek boat,which were amazing!!! This is for sure our local favorite for sushi!!! Jeremy was our server and he was great!!!

My wife, kids and i have tried giving this place multiple chances but every time we have been disappointed. I was shocked that the management would allow the hostesses to dress so provocative for being a small town bar and grill. Also- the girls were playing on their phones while we were waiting for them to find time for us The food is over priced and the servers always seemed stressed out. I'm glad there are a lot of new restaraunt a opening in town.

I had picked up a couple cedar boards to cook salmon earlier this summer at this location. I went back tonight to pick up a few and couldn't find them. I asked multiple employees who looked at me like I was nuts. Really frustrated!

My wife was having issues with her IPhone so we went in and were told it would be 20-40 mins. We were called within 15 mins as our specialist was Karen. She was super helpful!

I was needing pizza's for a customer as close to 11am as possible. I called around to 5 other pizza places who had no interest in helping me. I called them and told them my predicament and they were more than willing to help me. Not to mention their pizza was very good!!! Thank you!

I was put in charge of choosing a caterer for our open house which we were expecting 200-300 people. There were a lot of caterers to choose from but after communicating with the owner and reviewing his quote, I knew Jeff was my choice.  On the day of our event he was on time and dressed appropriately. The meat was fresh and super hot! All the sides were amazing flavor! He kept all the containers full.   Jeff we will recommend you to everyone!

The food was good but I have had way better, especially for the price. All their sauces were prepackaged, not impressed. Probably wouldn't go back.

I see so many great reviews but they are only open for dinner. There are a lot of  pizza places in the QC and can't believe they wouldn't be open for lunch. Super disappointed.

My family and I are passing through Vegas and found this place. We were hoping to sit down and relax but it's more of a take out type of place. We were about to leave and the owner ran out and gave us a menu. I felt since she made that effort we would take it back to our room.  Super nice family owned place! The pizza was super fresh and the salads were amazing.  The owner was appreciative for our business and gave our boys a bottle of Sprite. Please support this business!

This is one of the better car washes I've used.  I have a monthly subscription and go almost everyday. Well worth the value!

My wife, kids, and I were going to try another new restaurant in Queen Creek but the wait was an hour long, so we decided to try the Manhattan Vine instead. We sat in the lounge which had a relaxed yet classy vibe, where there were several TVs displaying various sports games and shows. First, we ordered a Meat & Cheese Platter, which had a delicious variety of specialty meats, cheeses, fruit, olives, and nuts. We also had the bruschetta, which was my wife's favorite. For our entree we ordered the Manhattan Special Pizza which was also very good. We would definitely recommend this pizza if you aren't sure what to order. To finish off our night we had the Dessert Trio, which came with a Cannoli, Cheesecake, and Tiramisu. Our waitress, Brooke, was helpful to answer our questions, provided perfect service, and was super friendly. The lounge vibe was very relaxed and we felt comfortable having the kids with us. Thanks Brooke for making our first time at the Manhattan a great experience. We will definitely come back again!

My wife, kids and I were so excited to eat here, but at 6pm there was a 1 hour wait. I know this places deserves more stars but I'm disappointed in the wait for being a Monday. We will give it another chance in a few weeks.

So I wanted to give Oreganos another chance. I called in a mini stuffed pizza (sausage and pepperoni) around 11:15am today 10/16 and they said it wouldn't be ready until 12:30pm. I pulled into the parking lot and it was totally packed, but thankfully there was to go parking spot available. I got back to work and tried the mini stuff pizza and it was so good! I can't wait to take my family.

The staff and management are very friendly. I came tonight to watch UFC 199 which they are one of the only bars here in QC showing it. This will for sure be my go-to for the fights from now on.
