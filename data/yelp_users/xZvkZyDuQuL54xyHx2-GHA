I was excited to try this restaurant as cheese, bread, and wine are my favorite food groups, and I have to say, it didn't disappoint.  Thankfully, my friends are similarly like minded and we feasted on bruschetta, cheese plates, and assorted dips.  While not the most balanced of dinners, it was incredibly delicious.    I plan on coming back here and gorging on cheese the next time I'm in the area.

I can't comment on the sit down portion of the restaurant, but it's a great place to stop in and get bagels. The bagels are definitely better quality then your average bagel place, and they have a nice variety of toppings for them. I ordered a veggie delight, and while I wish it had had more avocado, it had the right portions of everything else. My friend also had a great idea to get a few sides of breakfast potatoes to accompany the bagels. The home fries were awesome, saut√©ed with onions with the perfect amount of seasoning. Warning though, anything coming from the actual restaurant takes much longer than just getting a bagel, and the portions are huge!

I thought the Good Egg was mediocre.  I got a veggie omelet with brie.  The brie was really thin and sparse and the veggies were definitely not fresh.  Also, my plate came with the toast on it and it still had empty space.  If I'm paying money for a meal, I want my plate to be full.    Service was fine.  They kept my coffee and water cup full throughout the meal.  But, unfortunately the best service would not make up for the poor quality ingredients.

I have family in Scottsdale and I think that I've eaten here literally every time I see them.  Last night was no exception, so off to Ra's happy hour we went.  They've recently changed their menu, so the happy hour offerings were different as well.  They have a few more drinks on special, but I went with the white sake sangria which is always a favorite.  Edamame was good per usual.  But, the new offerings are what blew us away.  The shisito peppers were probably my favorite part of the meal.  They were simple, but every bite was spicy and filled with garlic. Also new and garlicy, were the garlic sugar snap peas.  These were cooked well and very good.  The dengaku tofu is an old favorite.  I have to praise Ra for the amount of vegetarian dishes on their happy hour.  There were more options than we ended up ordering and that is extremely rare on most menus.  My only complaint with the new menu was the vegetable roll.  They seemed to have gotten rid of a standard veggie roll with cucumber, carrots, and avocado wrapped with nori.  The new roll is wrapped in rice paper and had artichoke hearts, and iceberg lettuce and a few other things mixed in.  I like that they tried to give it a new spin, but sometimes you really just want the classic.

This place has great ambiance, but the quality of food does not match.  First off, you have to pay for chips and salsa, which is fine, but I find pretty annoying for a Mexican restaurant.  I do expect if I'm paying for chips though, that they are made on site.  These tasted bagged and almost stale, though the salsa was good.  They are definitely trying to offer more upscale Mexican-influenced entrees, but the menu left something to be desired.  I ended up making a meal of sides.  The veggies were cooked fine, but the garlic mashed potatoes were gummy, and had absolutely no flavor.  For a restaurant that was a bit pricey, it's sad to walk away disappointed with your meal.

The Valley Ho is an experience.  A friend and I stayed here a few weeks ago, and I could not have been happier with our stay.  Our room was clean, had a feel that was a mixture between vintage and modern, and I loved the balcony that was attached to the room.  Our room was facing the pool, which made it convenient for the pool party on Saturday, as well.    The pool party added an extra dimension of fun to the hotel.  There was music, drinking, and mingling by the pool, and my friends and I were able to hang out and have a good time.  They have buckets of beer for $16, but all the rest of the pool drinks seemed pricey.  And while two guests are free for each room, every other guest is $25 dollars.  Depending how much you want to drink, the prices can definitely add up.    I would stay here again, but only if I'm able to spend a day hanging out by the pool/enjoying the hotel.  There are cheaper options in the area if you're only planning on sleeping at a hotel.

Had breakfast here this morning for the first time and upon arrival I was impressed.  The restaurant is open and bright and there was free coffee in the lobby, definitely a kind of place that I want to start my morning.  After being seated, a coffee pot and water pitcher were brought to the table.  I really like this as I tend to drink water faster than it can be refilled and it prevented me from drinking too many cups of coffee, which tends to happen when someone else is pouring.    The food was good as well.  I ordered the greek fetish omelet.  It was overall tasty, but I felt like they skimped on the filling.  I like a full omelet and this was far from it.  The english muffin was normal and the side potatoes were good, but nothing remarkable.  My Aunt had the chikichanga and she loved it.  I would probably try one of their more specialty items if I came back again.

Chompies, I wanted to love you, but you missed the mark. I grew up surrounded by Jewish delis, and had been sincerely missing that being in Arizona. They have classic Jewish favorites and the matzo ball soup, and bagels were hits for our group. However, the quality of food and the service were not consistent throughout the meal. We had to ask multiple times for the complimentary pickles to be delivered to the table, and they arrived as we were finishing out meal. The dish I ordered, someone in the kitchen decided to add bacon to, which very much upset this vegetarian. I was offered another meal, but when I didn't particularly trust anything coming from the kitchen at that point. The meal was comped, which was appreciated, but it didn't change the fact that I was extremely let down by a meal that I was looking forward to. At this point, I have no desire to visit Chompies in the future.

Holy, yum.  I was able to have brunch here, when I was in town for a wedding, and I'm sure glad I did.    For brunch, my boyfriend and I both ordered omelets. The omelets were pretty standard fair, but with big portions and cooked well.  This place really excels in the details more than anything else.  The water is infused with cucumber, which makes it refreshing and just that much more special.  With your meal, you get toast, potatoes and your choice of side, where most places make you opt out of potatoes if you want something else.  The meal came with a side of rosemary creme fraiche that was absolutely delicious.  I love rosemary and the condiment meshed well with both the omelet and potatoes and infused a rosemary tang.  The potatoes were cooked well, no soggy home fries here, and the fruit was a nice mix of watermelon, grapes, and pineapple.  But the real star of the show, and the reason I hope to eat here again is the jam.  Oh my goodness, this jam was homemade and absolutely excellent.  It was filled with fresh berries and elevated a normal piece of toast to epic proportions.  I want some more just thinking about it.  The food is solid, the staff attentive and friendly, and the jam phenomenal.

5th and wine was incredibly accommodating to a large group of us on a busy Saturday night. The food took a while to come out of the kitchen, but the waitress gave us the heads up that they were backed up, before we order.  There were good deals on wine, and I enjoyed both of the wines I tasted. I ordered the burrata caprese, and the kale Caesar to split with a friend. The burrata was great, but the cinnamon pine nuts in the salad made it too sweet for my liking. The portions were small, so if you're a big eater be prepared to order several dishes.

I don't have any revolutionary thoughts on this place, but my friends and I had a great meal here when we were visiting the Scottsdale area. First, what everyone says is true, get the pretzels. The pretzel bites on their own are well made, and when you throw in the provolone fondue, they're just stellar. I could have eaten these for a meal and been happy. Our group had already done happy hour snacks before hand, so I stuck to a side salad for my main course; I needed some greens after loading up on pretzels and cheese.  There's not much you can say about a side salad, all the ingredients were fresh and the buttermilk ranch dressing had such a tang that it blew my mind. I also had a specialty cocktail made with blueberry moonshine and cucumber, that shouldn't have worked, but it did.   Our server was friendly and the right amount of attentive. There was a guitarist at the perfect sound level. I thought this place had good food, and really excelled at the details to bring it to that next level.

RnR has a great brunch during the weekends. I came here with a big group and we were all impressed by the party atmosphere, paired with efficient service. There's a great deal on bottomless mimosas, and our server, Cassie (who was phenomenal) kept our glasses filled. They give you a wristband for the mimosas, so you can float around the restaurant, and can get a new drink wherever you are. The dj was great, and I appreciated that he took requests and played them quickly. I would definitely come back here for brunch when I'm up in Scottsdale.

Went to local bistro for Easter brunch, and the food, and service were great from start to finish. They have a diverse brunch menu and my group enjoyed eggs benedict, pizza, and the hamburger. The ingredients on everything tasted fresh, and everyone walked away satisfied from the meal. They have a bottomless mimosa deal during brunch, and our waitress kept them flowing and plentiful, which was extremely appreciated. There were even little details like allowing us to pick which citrus fruit we wanted in our water. This restaurant clearly cares about their customers, and the quality of their food. I will be back when I'm in the area.

The Herb Box is my kind of restaurant.  Everything on their menu looked appealing, and fresh, with lots of veggies.  My friend and I split the mezze and the brussel sprout flatbread sans pancetta.  Both were excellent, but the real star was the flatbread, the combination of cheese and roasted garlic was delectable.  We also had mimosas along with our meal, and with mango instead of orange juice, they felt extra special.    The service here was great, and they had a nice outdoor patio to enjoy your meal on.  The location in the middle of Scottsdale can't be beat either.

I got to stop in here recently for lunch while visiting Phoenix, and I was definitely impressed. Thankfully, I was with a large group and I got to sample a chunk of the menu because everything was delicious!  I definitely suggest starting with the bruschetta. The ingredients were fresh, and the portions were large. I also had the arancini and the asparagus pizza. It's hard to go wrong with the arancini, balls of risotto in a nice red sauce, and the pizza had a good crust and ingredients with the egg on top also making it unique. Add in some red sangria with this and you have all the making for an amazing lunch.  In addition, we had a large group and the service was always prompt and friendly. I'm so happy I got to try this place!

I really liked O.H.S.O.  My friend and I came in on a Monday for lunch, and had our pick of the patio.  Pitchers of beer were half off, and they have a great selection of local and non-local brews.  Our server was incredibly attentive.  We split the green chile dip to start, and it was awesome.  We literally devoured it to the last drop.  The housemade veggie burger was good as well, and didn't fall apart which is a complaint I have about most veggie burgers.    All, in all a great place.  Nice patio and good beer and food? A new Phoenix favorite.

I visited this place on Easter Sunday night, and this place was packed with bros sporting their best pastels and girls wearing bunny ears. The mission statement of this restaurant is clear, get their customers as drunk as possible and let them do whatever they want. Let off party poppers in the middle of the restaurant, why not? Dance on the table next to customers that are eating, sure! Only visit if you're three sheets to the wind and want to go to a place where no one cares if you embarrass yourself.   They're only getting two stars because the margarita I had was quite good, and I'm picky when it comes to margaritas.
