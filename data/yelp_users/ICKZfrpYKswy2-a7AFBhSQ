Scarlett does the best hair cuts I ever had!! Highly recommend to visit her! The way she holds the scissors is really fun to watch

I am a client of the Skin of Dream for more than a year. Sandra is really professional and fast! That is really important to me, and I think for every lady that likes to wax.

Since I was a little girl I always loved to wear dresses, Lana makes one of a kind gorgeous dresses. As a photographer I love to work with her. She has such a great, stylish and creative vision in clothing.

That was the worstEST restaurant I have ever been! Service was horrible. They made my handicap aunt to get out from the scooter and walk. They didn't cook the food the way we asked. And instead of recooking they just brought it back with the bite on it. The manager called my husband sweety twice, which no-no in a restaurants!! This is my first bad review ever!! NEVER EVER COME TO THIS PLACE!!!
