Love this place - one of my favorite places to run, a great place to walk the dog, check out nature with the kids, a walk at dusk with the wife.  We have seen some amazing wildlife from brightly colored love birds to coyotes.  The rentable camp sights are clean and and designed in a way that gives you a real desert camping experience, only a quarter mile from the nearest Walgreens :-). Great date place, family fun place, and a retreat from city life right in the middle of the city.

This is a staple breakfast stop for my wife and I.  The Food never disappoints - the staff is mostly great (get a bad apple in the bunch every so often) - but I can only give it 4 stars because the wait can be quite long...  Mostly because the food never disappoints.

Good Starbucks - speedy inside service but the drive thru can get bogged down a bit in the mornings, good coffee, friendly staff, one of my favorite Starbucks !

This place was great... Well as great as a doctors visit can be.  They called us (my son was the patient)  back within 5 minutes and immediately saw a doctor.  She was kind and took her time - asked a lot of questions and did not hastily diagnose and fully explained to us what was going on with my son's health.

The best Gelato ever...EVER!!!  Yeah I said it.  What?  Seriously, the best customer service I've experienced since the '70s.  By the time I ordered I was nearly full because they encourage customers to try everything - easily 20 different favors to sample and choose from.  My favorites are the dark chocolate, salted caramel, peach champagne, and black cherry.  We've visited multiple times and have never been disappointed - same quality service and deliciousness every time.  My kids referred them to a friend and he owner gave my kids free gelato on their next visit - they appreciate their customers.  If your looking for your next vice, check this place out!

MAYBE THEY RIPPED ME OFF!!!  Long story but could save you in the end - I needed a specific tire replaces and they replaced the wrong one on purpose without consulting me the customer - I found out the next day when I woke up to a flat tire again and saw that a different tire than requested was replaced.  Their explanation was that they believed the tire they changed was in greater need of replacement - even though we looked at all four tires together and agreed that only the tire I requested needed changed.  To prove their point they pulled out an old tire that looked like it was machined down to the steel in a very isolated 3" area that looked nothing like the ware on the rest of the tire.  My fault - should have checked the work immediately, but instead, assumed that their smiling faces and well wishes while I paid them meant all was done according to plan.  So did they mistakenly change the wrong tire and then grind it down to the metal to cover their rear ends? I think so, but maybe not... What they did do was leave enough room in my mind to speculate and feel responsible enough to warn others of their poor practice.

Food was just okay, but too pricey for what you got.  I like restaurants with the kitchen open to the dining room (Pei Wei / Arrogant Butcher) - it's fun to watch the chefs do their thing like a rehearsed dance.  What's not fun is watching the staff bicker and frustrate one another.  This made our visit more stressful than entertaining.  Wait staff was slow and not very attentive - thought about giving it another try, but it looks like this is all pretty common according to other reviews.

I have used Signature West multiple times over the past 5 years for both commercial use (a church property) and my personal residence.  I couldn't be more pleased with the quality of service they provide nor with the professional manner in which they provide.    The church property I managed had the unfortunate experience of a flood - our hot water heater burst - ON A SATURDAY NIGHT!  1.5 inches of water across the entire facility.  They stopped the water flow, sucked up the water, cut out drywall, and got the building to a place where we could have church service by morning.  All the damage was completely repaired by the following week's church service!   Fast!  High Quality!  Reasonably Priced!  CALL THEM!

Love the concept of savory, clean eating.  4 visits layer and I'm finally convinced they are not able to provide a good consistent dining experience.  The first time the food was good service terrible.  2nd visit (early on a Friday night) out of flat bread... What restaurant runs out of one of their signature items before the biggest dinning out night of the week?  We got bbq beef sandwiches which were awesome... but they brought out sweet potato fries that were burnt black.  One thing to burn them another to serve them.  You can see our dilemma... They showed promise but never delivered.  3rd visit more of the same.  4th visit I thought I'd try for breakfast.  An hour past opening time, the door was open, no sign off a breakfast menu, nobody at the counter, not another person dining, staff see me but ignore me for 4 minutes.  As I leave someone finally says "good morning. we are open".  Too late!
