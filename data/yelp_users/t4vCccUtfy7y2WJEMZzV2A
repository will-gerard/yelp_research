We got 18XX in HoneySuckle 5 building, and it didn't disappoint. We went on our timeshare exchange with RCI. I was a bit skeptical since we usually stay at the standard 5 star strip hotels (Palazzo, Aria, Delano, etc..). But the finishes rivaled those hotels and the space was larger. It's definitely for families as it has a full kitchen with granite slabs. And on top of that it has a double stack washer and dryer! The only things that got me to subtract a star was the check in process. You have to find the building which is hard to find at night and upon entering it looks like a timeshare check-in. No grand lobby - so it throws you off and lowers your expectations, which is good, because (like I said above) the rooms are awesome. Good thing is that it's organized and well staffed. The slight annoyance is you have to go to another counter to get your parking permit, which is staffed with timeshare folks. I declined everything, and got my permit. Make sure you ask the front desk to double check the room number, we were told 80X. So after a drive across the lots and buildings, it's a good 10 min walk. Also parking is free here but a nightmare. I suggest the adjacent garage. We had to call the front desk only to be told she gave us the wrong room number. Luckily it all worked out. Glad we saved money and ended up with a luxury suite with a full kitchen.

If you want great quality burgers and are willing to pay the price then this is the place for you. I got the Nom Nom burger and it was excellent. It has a Kobe beef patty and thick layer of cheese and a slight creamy layer of 1000 island dressing and to top it off crispy potato chips, which makes it not only savory but also texturally stimulating. My wife got the "Urthbuger", which is a vegetable patty and other green stuff... Lol.. I'll never understand women. I personally didn't think it was good but she loved it. The server also asked if she was vegan to check if she wanted cheese. I thought that was good and paying attention to detail. The service was also top notch, my water was refilled. Also if you check-in on yelp you get a free 12oz draft. My daughter got a cheese sandwich meal which was decent but the mini fudge sundae made it worth 6$ (see pic). It was large, and yummy with a big scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. Easily fed the 3 of us and we didn't even finish it. All said with tax, tip... It was worth paying 55$. I'd still prefer In/Out but it was Thanksgiving and the only establishments open are on the strip. Only minus a star for the price.

Stopped by at 5:15pm on Saturday for my wife. I walked in and it was only staffed with 1 person who doesn't even give a massage. I asked how much it was and she stated 60$/60 minutes. I was shocked since it looked like a standard Chinese reflexology. Usually it's 20 or 30$. She asked if that was ok and since we were in a rush I said OK, but then she said "wait, let me call since the lady is on a break"... I waited and could hear her say she'll be back at 8pm!!! What 3 hour break is that? And she didn't even seem happy about it. Luckily she wasn't there. Who wants to be given a massage by unhappy staff? So I yelped and we went to Magnolia spa which was close by and it was cheaper. If you plan to go make sure to call ahead of time. We won't be back again.

5 stars for service... We got immediately seated. Initially we had intended to go to Carlos Bakery but the line wrapped around the corner, it had 3 different lines! So we decided to check out Buddy's restaurant instead and it was the best decision as we got to sit down. The restaurant is clean, large and well designed - it has elements of a modern Italian restaurant and they have pics of Buddy and his family on the dessert menu. We ordered the cannoli, tiramisu and large lobster tail. Since we ate lunch, we weren't hungry and thus didn't try the entrees. But the lobster tail dessert was worth 15$ and it can easily feed 4 people. The tiramisu was not good and the cannoli was sub par.

Some of the best doughnuts I have had. The  best part is eating them fresh and piping hot.

Lovely ambiance and modern and clean restaurant. Service is very attentive and it's also suitable for large family dining, we had a group of 25 people.  The Penne al Samone is heaven along with the Pollo Della Casa.
