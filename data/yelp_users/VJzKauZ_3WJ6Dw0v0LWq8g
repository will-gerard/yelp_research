Cozy, good selection, clean toilets, monthly change of wall decor. I'm content.

I considered giving Z Pizza one star but I thought I would be more generous than one of the staff members was to me.   In New Times there used to be a coupon for a free slice of pizza.  I saved my coupon as it did not have an expiration date.  One day I sauntered into Z Pizza and presented my coupon and ordered a soda to go along with the pizza.  I was told by the clerk that I could not use the coupon because "too many homeless people" were using the coupon and they no longer honor the coupon.  I am not homeless nor do I "look" homeless.  Instead I was told I could order a special that included two slices of pizza and a soda.  I won't ever forget the woman behind the counter who so coldly denied me my slice of pizza.  I promised myself that I would never return.  Few months later...  I thought to myself "Self, you should really give Z Pizza another try.  Maybe it was just a bad day."  I called Z Pizza and asked for a delivery of a half soy and half regular cheese pizza.  In the past when I had ordered such a pizza, someone from Z Pizza was kind enough to mark which side was soy and which side was regular.  I thought the same would happen. I was wrong.  I received the pizza with no indication as to which side was soy and which side wasn't.  I called Z Pizza and asked about their soy cheese pizzas without telling them my predicament.  I was told "Our soy cheese pizzas are so good you can't tell the difference between regular and soy cheese."  I proceeded to explain that in this case, I needed to know the difference and asked why it wasn't marked.  The woman on the phone asked "How are we suppposed to do that?"  I stated that in the past the soy side of the pizza was marked by a white piece of plastic that served as both to keep the pizza box from caving in on the pizza and it also served to indicate which side was soy.    I asked to speak with a manager after I realized I was getting nowhere with the woman on the phone.  She told me I would need to call the following day if I wanted to speak with someone in charge.  I then asked them to send me a small pizza with only soy cheese as a replacement at no charge.  I was told that they would call me back once they got the ok to make me another pizza.  They called me back and stated they would give me a small soy pizza but that it was on the bottom of their delivery list and insinuated that it was not a priority.  It took another hour for them to deliver the small, soy pizza.  Customer service at its finest?  I think not.  Not only did I have to think for them and offer my own form of compensation for their inadequacy but it was the second time that I had been treated in poor manner.    Save your money.   Come to think of it, I think I give Z Pizza just one star.  I will not bother ordering from Z Pizza ever again.

Hana never fails us.  The service is excellent and the sushi is fresh and melts like butter every time.  One of the main reasons we continue to be patrons of Hana is the fact that they most always have Uni on the menu. Alert:  BYOB.  Stop by at the AJ's on Camelback and Central for some sake to go with your meal. Hana provides a chiller for your cold sakes.

Anytime I have a hankerin' for a burger and fries, I head here.  When I'm feeling extra adventurous I order a chocolate shake.  The burgers taste like you grilled them on your own outdoor grill.  They even smell smoked.  Good buns, huge portion of fries, crispy outer meat layer.  Skip the corporate fast food joints and head over to Lucky Burger.

I'm done with Lucky Burger.  The second to the last visit, I took my out of town relatives to Lucky Burger because they wanted a "good burger."  Between the three of us, we ordered quite a bit of food.  My cousin wanted to bring in a diet (?) Dr. Pepper can that she had in a cooler to enjoy it with her burger and proceeded to ask for a cup of ice.  The owner denied us a cup of ice and said we were not allowed to bring in outside drinks.  I found it to be a bit unreasonable since we ordered lots of food AND drink.  How was one can of soda going to hurt the man, financially?  I was embarrassed as I had recommended Lucky Burger to my out of town guests.  A few months later, I returned and ate a burger, fries and soda.  I think the prior experience left a sour taste in my mouth and I was no longer able to enjoy the meal (followed by a stomach ache).  I will no longer eat at Lucky Burger nor will I recommend the location to my house guests.

I've always had a good meal here. I'm not sure what there is to gripe about. I think as a Yelper it's important to focus on the food and overall niche that a restaurant serves to it's community.  If you're looking for a red sauce kind of Italian restaurant (lasagna, meatballs, spaghetti) this is not the place for you.  As a matter of fact, not ALL Italian food consist of red sauce dishes.  My suggestion is to attend La Piccola for lunch as there are a plethora of excellent sandwiches.  While you're doing so, sneek a peek at what a potential dinner might look like.  Take some time and speak with the owner, you'll find he's an educated man and takes great pride in his restaurant and  fresh food.

My pets are very fortunate to have Just Around the Corner as their caretakers when we are out of town and need someone to feed them in our home or have an event at our home (remodeling or maintenance) which requires the dogs to board at the Just Around the Corner.  Just Around the Corner is a family-owned business and conducts their business out of their personal homes.  This arrangement is not for everyone but works perfectly for us.  More often times than not, we require feedings/watering/medicating for our dogs.     I generally speak with Mara, Theresa's daughter, and she is able to accommodate our needs and set our minds at ease.  Jessie, a Just Around the Corner family member and employee, is remarkable and is the one who provides us with house visits while we are away.  She is extremely competent.  My pets are on several medications and the written instructions I leave are followed to a "T."  On days where we travel with our dogs, I can also ask Jessie to feed and water our chickens, water my plants on the patio and water my garden.    In addition, Jessie takes the time to really get to know our pets and their idiosyncrasies.  Once I have arrived from our excursions, I am comforted to know that she took care of my dogs because she "picks up" on their personalities.  She gives me a distinct description of their behavior which makes me realize she pays close attention to their individual characteristics.  Although I have never used their transportation services, I do know that they will pick up your pet from your home and board them for doggie daycare.  Furthermore, we do not require that JATC walk our dogs but I do know that service is available, too.  I do not hesitate to use Just Around the Corner and I do recommend them to others.

Finding someone who can make better mole than I can deserves 4 stars.  My absolute favorite is the chicken mole burrito.  The chickens mole burrito is just that- loaded with lots of shredded chicken, minimal rice in a flour tortilla.  The burros are gigantic and the drinks are gigantic.  I cannot comment on any other items as I am extremely satisfied with the mole and don't venture far from it.  I think you can order chicken mole tacos but I am unsure.  The salsa bar is tasty, too.    Apparently there is a Happy Hour on weekdays.  I noticed Tequila behind the bar but didn't see any beer and am unaware of what the Happy Hour entails.

The Summer Time Roll is a deliciously refreshing roll and the highlight of the evening. The Godzilla Roll is super chunky so bring a big mouthed companion with you and it is big in price, too. I would pass on the Crab Roll. Salmon nigiri tasted fresh and the portions were reasonable.  The Karatumba sake was good, as well.   So why the two stars? Mostly it was based on service and the fact that Uni was not present (just like many other sushi restaurants in town). It took well over 5 minutes after being seated for the server to come around and introduce herself and take our drink order.  It was not a busy night.    Throughout the whole evening our server only took one empty dish back to the kitchen.  I am fully aware that in some restaurants there are "servers" and there are "bussers" but I think servers should communicate with their bussers if the servers are less inclined to bus their own tables.  I understand that some servers want their bussers to work for their tips if the servers are "tipping them out."  We were left with empty plates at our dinner table for the whole evening.  Our server constantly asked us if we needed more to drink and we might have been more inclined to stay and order more drinks if our table had been bussed.     Earlier at throughout the dinner, when we asked for soy sauce she grabbed the soy sauce container from an unbussed table that was dripping sloppily with sauce on the outside of the container. Later, because she chose an easy solution, we quickly ran out of soy sauce and she actually had to go inside the kitchen and bring us a filled, clean container. Overall, the impression we received is that of a lazy server.  We most likely will not go to Stingray again unless it is for a quick bite of a Summertime Roll.

Today I ordered the Signature Bread Salad. Dee-lish! If you're looking for more greens of a kind of salad (i.e. lettuce, kale, spinach, chard) this is not the salad for you. This perfect and refreshing salad included mozzarella balls, warm pieces of bread, various types of olives, MANY tomatoes, slivers of red onions, balsamic vinaigrette and was worthy of a picture. The salad reminded me of a very large bruschetta as a salad. Be sure you compliment it with a glass of wine. Unfortunately, I couldn't but I did drink it with an Arnold Palmer.   One more thing-I've read a lot of reviews about Brick that provide criticism regarding the wait staff. My server was wonderful. I got refills when I wasn't even asked for it and felt that my server, although a "vampire" by some of your assessments, was very attentive and helpful. I look forward to trying some more dishes at Brick in the near future.

Stopped by to grab a quick iced coffee and a piece of quiche/bagel/breakfast sandwich.  I was pleased with both items.  I didn't ask for anything fancy as far as coffee goes.  Just an iced latte with vanilla flavoring and soy milk-small.  The best part was the Quiche Lorraine-dense and loaded with onions.  A cup of rasberries and pineapple on the side.  Took it To Go.  Give yourself some time to eat here and don't rush it like I did because the food takes a little time coming out of the kitchen.  Glad to have a neighborhood coffee joint, again.  Good luck, Perc Up!

I was first introduced to Green through a friend who had her birthday dinner catered by Green and later visited the Scottsdale Road location.  This was over 2 years ago.  Soon after, I learned that Green was opening a location just down the street from my home in Phoenix.  This is by far one of my favorite places in Phoenix.  I have yet to try everything on the menu.  The service is always friendly, the drinks are always refreshing and the bathrooms are always clean.  If you Like Green on Facebook, you can stay up to date with the specials that Green has to offer and at which location.

I've always been pleasantly surprised by White Sage. The food is so delicately prepared and scrumptiously flavored. Today, I had the red potato, leek and mozzarella quiche with a side of sweet red grapes. This is one of the better quiches I've ever tasted. Probably one of the more memorable things about White Sage is the customer service.

I was looking forward to their opening and now I feel I need to wait a few months longer before I try again.    On a Friday night, a hostess/server greeted us after a good 5 minutes of waiting by the door and asked us if we would be ordering food since the kitchen was backed up.  If we were to order, our food would arrive well over an hour of our arrival.  Naturally, this was all the information we needed enough to say "No, we're just here for a beer or two."  Soon after, we were seated and placed an order for 3 pints.  We waited a good 15-20 minutes for our beers.  During that time, we noticed lots of servers standing around one POS (point of sale).  It looked as if servers were waiting in line to put in their individual orders.  Our suspicion was confirmed later that evening, only one working POS.  I wonder why they didn't have a backup plan-paper tickets?  I would think people would be more inclined to walk out on their tab because of the excruciating wait than management have to worry about losing money with paper tickets.  Our waters were refilled twice before our first round of beers arrived at our table.  Two of my buddies call this place the "Water House" because that's all they got when they visited Angel's Trumpet Ale House.    Once we received our beers, we asked her to place another order for another round of beers because we figured that we would receive our 2nd set of beers just as we finished our first ones.  It worked!  If ya plan on having another beer, be sure to place an order as soon as the first beers arrive so that you don't hafta wait long for your second beer.    I think the night was best portrayed by a sneak peek that I got of the owner- he was rubbing his temples and obviously under stress.   I am inclined to give them a star or two more once the timing has improved.    Great building, good ambiance, wonderful patio (hope it's pet friendly), excellent location and a good selection of beers.    Oh, I like the idea of three bathroom choices instead of the typical two.
