I used to go here all the time 10 - 15 years ago.  It was mediocre to okay.  Nothing to write home about but not terrible.  Thought I would give it another chance last night.  BIG MISTAKE.  Chicken fried rice had almost no chicken in it.  Hunan beef medium spicy was bland.  Beef Egg Foo Yung was unidentifiable in the container.  Only once I stabbed into it did I discover the egg patty which was disgusting at best.  Fried dumplings were way too doughy and the sauce was way too bland.  Appetizer order of BBQ spare ribs were 4 pieces cut through the bones - not even full bones + meat.  And the "free" sesame chicken" that came with an order over $35 came smothered in sweet and sour sauce for some unknown reason.   I know I still remember good Chinese food from my San Francisco days but I have adjusted my expectations the past 20 years in Phoenix.  This was just over the top awful.

Carman has been my go-to person for 12 years now.  We have an agreement:  She doesn't tell me how to do my job and I don't tell her how to do her job.  I just say "fix it" and she is off to the races.  I have followed her through 3 salons and now on to her own place where she has truly blossomed.  You will not be sorry to check her out.
