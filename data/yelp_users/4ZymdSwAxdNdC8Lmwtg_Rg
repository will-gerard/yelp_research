This place has good food, but can't ever seem to get an order right. When you mess up my order 3 times in a row, I'm not going to come back. Well, oops, I did come back and they messed my order up AGAIN. No cheese. Simple. I personally don't care how good your food is if you can't get te simple order right.

Came here for happy hour with my Moms and was taken back by how great everything was!  Food was great and fresh! Ordered a spicy tuna roll that was actually a bit spicy unlike other places (I dig the heat!) Also had an order of potstickers that seem to filled with a homemade sausage that had a great bite to it! Excellent flavor and completely different than most other places. Lastly, we shared an order of Wor Wonton soup that was filled to the brim of the bowl with everything you'd expect!  Arvand, the bartender/server has a personality and customer service as unique as his name!  He was clear and concise with helping me choose some happy hour options as I had not dined here before. He also presented us with many options as to sauces and sides..he REALLY knows how treat customers!   With so many great options around Autumn Court, it was an easy explanation as to why I had never been inside before, but after today I will DEFINITELY be back and tell my friends!  Thanks Arvand and Autumn Court!

This place is doing many things right. Great food and killer service!  Walked in ten minutes to close (without realizing it, honest) and was still served in a professional manner. The manager on duty (who I later found out is the GM) Adam, definitely takes serious care of those who dine at squid ink! Your food is great and with such rad staff, I will absolutely come back for more, much thanks!
