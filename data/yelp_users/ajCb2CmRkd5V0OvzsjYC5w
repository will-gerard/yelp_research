This is the best Todai I've ever been to - quality fish, tasty sushi...A much better idea than going to a $250-a-head steak dinner.

Positives: - Nice lobby - Expansive Arizona parking  Negatives: (in the order I found them) - Rest of hotel is ancient and beat - Rooms not updated - the fake brass around the mirrored closet doors is awesome - Ice machine was broken - Phone was broken - Bizarre process to sign in to free internet - And the big winner: the HVAC is incredibly loud. Even with earplugs it kept waking me up. - Not that the hotel can do much about this, but Mesa is pretty crappy...
