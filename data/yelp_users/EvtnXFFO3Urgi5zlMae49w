You can get a manicure and pedicure here, hence the 1 start, but I advise that you do not. The technician that did my toes was very sloppy with the cuticle clipper and callus shaver. He removed layers of my skin on the top of my big toe above the knuckle, so much that it stung like the Dickens when he applied alcohol to dry my toes. The callus shaver got the back of my leg a couple of times too. Both technicians were rather aggressive. The first with add-on packages that I had to refuse three times. The second disagreeing with my request that my nails only be buffed wth a buffing spong and not grinded with a dremel. The gel manicure did not include culticle softening or pushing back the cuticles. My cuticles were cute dry after the manicure. At the end a third technician messed up one of my toes putting on my flip flops and just brushed a quick layer of polish over the top. It looks terrible. Go anywhere else.

I'm so happy to have Smoothie King in the 'hood. I'm not so happy about using so much styrofoam. I purchased a Smoothie King blender bottle for the sake of sustainability, but when it's crowded, it's hard to know when to offer my reusable bottle. Maybe this is a corporate issue, but please pass the feedback along. We need recyclable or compostable cups.
