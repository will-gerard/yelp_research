Nice little hole in the wall bar! Has a really neat atmosphere on the patio. Our server was awesome! Very attentive and friendly. And our waters were never empty. I gave this four stars instead of 5 because the food was alright. Pretty good for bar food though!

They tell you you're a couple sizes bigger so you HAVE to get them tailored when your order comes in!!! Me and 5 other girls ordered our bridesmaids dresses from here and went in to get our measurements before we ordered. The girl told us all our sizes and we were confused by the drastic difference from our normal size but were assured the sizing for that designer ran small. I am usually between a 4 - 6 and was told to order a 10?! We just got all of our orders in the other day and were shocked to see the extra 3-5 inches of fabric hanging off of us. The dresses literally fall off of us. One of the bridesmaids was told to order a size 20 because of her bust!! Which in turn they made her pay extra for the larger size and then when she got the dress in and saw it in no way fit her at all (you could fit a watermelon in there with her) they told her it would cost extra to do the tailoring because of how much extra fabric there was!! Really?? RIDICULOUS! If we all had ordered my normal size we would have saved a trip to the seamstress. Needless to say... none of us used theirs. A scheme to get people to spend more money at their store?? Sounds like it to me!   MAKE SURE YOU ASK THEM YOUR MEASUREMENTS AND ASK TO SEE THE BOOK FOR SIZING. It'll save you $70-$100!  I will never order/shop from this store again.

Seriously. This place is awesome. I have never once had a bad experience here. They are always nice, accommodating, and genuinely friendly. They offer you free granola while you wait for your food, which is homemade, and when you get your meal, it looks like a piece of art! A gourmet dish! I almost didn't want to eat, it looked too good! I had the lemon drop crepe, and the lemon curd and raspberry sauce was painted onto the plate. Seriously beautiful. Keep it up crepe bar! You're doing awesome!

We fell in love with this restaurant before we even ordered our food. And then fell a little more when we actually ate our meal. The decor is on point, especially the Christmas decorations. So cute and cozy. We would have loved to sit on the patio if it weren't so cold outside. They do have fire pits though, so maybe next time. The service was great, awesome wine selection and really good pizza and salads. We love our pizza so we can get a bit picky. They passed the test. This could possibly be our new favorite restaurant. We'll be back for sure!!

It was $16 for a slice of quiche and lemon bar. And when I walked in and stood at the counter, no one said hello to me even though they all saw me walk in. I stood for another minute before the lady behind the counter quite rudely said "well do you need more time to figure out what you want?"  Great greeting. I was clearly ready to order when I walked in. She made me feel like I was in convenience because they were "understaffed" for the day. With a little nicer customer service they could have had me come back another time. Although, come to think of it, not sure the food was worth the $16. That's a bit expensive.

Went in around 11pm on a Saturday night and this place wasn't very busy. Our server only had one table (ours) and completely disappointed us. We ordered a couple of beers and took about 10-15 minutes to get them to our table. Then we ordered the snack size wings for me and the buffalo grilled cheese for my husband. When we got our food (which took longer than should have for only being about 5 tables in the entire restaurant) I noticed that I only had 4 wings in my basket when the menu specifically says "at least 5" for the snack size. So I asked the server politely about it, because I understand it's not always the servers fault. He responded saying "on really? Well the number changes every week."... Then why does your menu say "at least 5"? He then told me he would get me another one. As for my husbands food, it was cold right off the bat, and only had a few small pieces of chicken. Time went by and we finished eating what we had. Our server brought our bill and I never did receive that last wing. Pretty disappointing service for being his only table. I can only image what he's like with a full section. I wouldn't have minded if he had just told me that they were out of wings for the night (if that were the case) by laziness doesn't fly in my book.   Ps. I gave this place 2 stars because it was the nicest bww I've been in so far. But that's not all you need to make a good restaurant. Hire some hard workers, Buffalo!
