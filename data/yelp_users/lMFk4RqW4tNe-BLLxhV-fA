Old, dated, but some seats have outlets for charging your devices.   The most decent food joint in the C wings is the Mexican place way down by C9. Pretty standard airport food (and fast food) either way.   The security staff here is always in a bad mood- demanding, bossy. I travel often and the checkpoint staff here could either use a motivational pep talk or some kind of training on connecting with or directing citizens who are not criminals. I feel like I'm getting ready for lock-up every time I go through the line in this place. Terrible way to end (or start) your trip.

We were referred to this place by a close friend who had eaten here the night before. She gave a great review to us, and we weren't feeling picky so we made a reservation and looked forward to a good meal.   Good meal doesn't come close to the real experience that happened at this establishment. I was blown away by the service, food, and ambiance. We had an incredible meal of the veal, bass, spinach, and peas along with the delicious starters of garlic bread, zucchini, and bruschetta.   I look forward to eating here again as soon as possible!

What a shame since this area is so beautiful. I wanted to enjoy these easy trails with my pup, but there is glass and trash everywhere. I hope the park staff or community put more into security here or a clean up crew- probably both are needed. These trails are not good for dogs or children.

So many poor reviews on here, IMO this is a decent gym. I've been going to this (McCormick Ranch) location and Shea interchangeably for about 6 months. The staff at McCormick Ranch is always pleasant. It is most definitely crowded, but hello folks you are going to a large gym in a busy, popular neighborhood. The location is great especially for a smoothie at One Stop afterward, or a sandwich at ToGos.   If you're worried about the "vibe" of the other ppl there and whether or not they are college age or middle age, flexing or eating nachos, then you my friend are not at the gym for yourself and that's on you. This place always functions as I need it to, machines are 98% in working order at all times, bathrooms are clean, hand sanitizer and paper towels are stocked.

I have used this service several times for airport trips. The drivers have always been on time, rain/shine/sleet/snow, always friendly and professional. I'd highly recommend this service.

Our dinner wasn't perfect, and I can't wait to come back here again. I highly recommend CPH.  Went here with some out-of-town guests as a kick off to their visit. Some of the food was served cold, and the lamb was served undercooked from what was requested. We mentioned it to the server and requested the lamb to be cooked a little more, as he asked how our meals were. He went above and beyond to make sure we were satisfied with not only our food, but our experience at this restaurant. Everything was exquisite.   I've never felt more appreciated by a restaurant for our patronage. With all that was done I can't bring myself to give less than 4 stars, even for an imperfect meal. Hopefully on our next visit it will be a solid 5!

We love rehab burger and eat here every couple months. The staff is nice, great, cool, on top of their game, and everything else positive you can say about a team of servers and bartenders. The food is out-of-this-world good, especially the side sauces and sweet potato tots. I try to have something different each time we go.  I don't know what else to say other than you'd be doing yourself a disservice if you didn't come here.

I have been here a handful of times over the past couple years, and Butcher has yet to disappoint! You cannot beat the ambiance, it's dark, transitional design provides an almost eery setting, but the music, lighting, and full on energy in here makes it incredibly lively.   The fried brussels will change your life, and the Moscow mules are one of the best I've found in the Burgh. If you're a whiskey drinker though, this place is surely for you. The wall behind the bar is stacked with dark liquor for two stories, complete with an old school wooden ladder on casters so they can access any kind at any time.

This is a really great idea for a private group. Though pricey, we had plenty of beer- but no food until some trail mix at stop 3. Plan accordingly, thank goodness we brought snacks.   The 3 breweries we went to were a great mix of large to small, all with different vibes and types of beer which was great. The three stops were Phoenix Ale Brewery, Wren House, and The Shop.  The main point holding me back from a better rating is the transportation. The van was TIGHT for seating 14 (and we only had 13), I mean we were practically on top of each other, and the AC was not working in 100 degree PHX heat. Everyone was uncomfortable.   Phoenix Ale Brewery was the largest facility and had a great variety of beer, but heads up no AC. They also gave us pint glasses which everyone was excited about. Wren House was so cozy we instantly felt at home and started playing jenga at the table. This was the best presentation of beer as everyone got a 4-beer flight. Our best stop on the tour was at The Shop (formerly Cartel Brewery) because a brewery employee came in the back with us and really gave us some personal insight to the company and the process. She was so personable, and everyone appreciated the hospitality they offered us at this stop.

I chose to stay in the SLS because I feel their food selections are above par in comparison with some other resorts or hotels close by (for an affordable rate). Cleo was no exception, service was decent to good, food was delicious. I had the lamb schwarma, spanakopita, and brussel sprouts. All were amazing except the brussels cooled off so quickly. It would be better if they were served in a hot skillet or something to keep them at serving temp.

I cannot wait to return. I came with two other women and we shared three small plates (all veggies) just to nibble while we chatted for an hour or so on a late evening. OH my goodness, each plate was to die for- literally the best "side dishes" I've ever tasted. Great job, chef. Looking forward to returning for an actual meal.  Also love the modern atmosphere and feel of the dining space.

This place doesn't look like much, but it's a little diamond in the rough. The service is great. You can tell its family owned with the same couple people in there, and so excited to talk with you about recommendations and what goes well with what. I've had the lamb gyro, chicken gyro, grape leaves, and hummus- all delicious. The side salads don't disappoint and have been fresh and crisp every time.

This review will be short and sweet, just like this menu. There are only a handful of choices: full chicken, 1/2 chicken, full rack ribs, 1/2 rack ribs. This is a no-fuss, all eats type of joint and it was amazing. The decor and ambience is not the main attraction, but honestly once you have these fall-off-the-bone ribs you could care less where you are at because your eyes roll to the back of your head in ecstasy anyway! Perfectly done, perfectly seasoned. The classic corn and slaw sides are a nice compliment. This is comfort food at its best.

I won a prize, so automatic 5 stars! Jk. This was my first Yelp event, and it was exactly what I was looking for.   Sauce gave us a great spread of bruschetta, salad, pasta, and pizza. Last but not least, dessert! All of the above were delicious and our service was really great as well.   As far as the event itself I felt very comfortable immediately sitting with a group of strangers, and being new to the area this was the perfect way to meet other Phoenicians and get to explore a new restaurant menu at the same time. Thanks for having me, I hope to start seeing you all around the scene more often.
