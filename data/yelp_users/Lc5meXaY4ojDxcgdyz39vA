If you need a haircut, you need to come see Boris and his crew. Very cool old school barber shop. If Boris, Ruben, or one of the other guys isn't cutting your hair, you're doing it wrong

This place says they have both DirecTV and Cox to draw people in who are interested in watching football games on the Pac-12 network but they're lying because they have to "re-wire" their TVs so you can't watch anything on Cox. It's amateur hour over here.
