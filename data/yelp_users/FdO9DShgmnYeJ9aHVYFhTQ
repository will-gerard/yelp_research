I have been going to this salon since it opened.  Ann is the absolute BEST!!  I have never had an issue with lifting...ever!  My nails are always nice and thin and look natural.  No funny edges when they grow out like so many salons.  I LOVE this place.  I went to many other nail salons before I found them, and now I would never go anywhere else.  Give Ann a try, I promise you won't be disappointed!

I got a Groupon for my daughter and I to try yoga.  Went to Joyful Yoga, and I have to say they were so welcoming, never made us feel awkward even though we were new to the studio and beginners at yoga.  The instructor made sure we were doing everything right and gave us lots of options throughout the whole class, but she never singled us out.  She would just come by and silently but gently help us with a pose...all while seamlessly instructing the class.  It was great.  And WHAT a workout!   Today my muscles feel like I did a high-impact aerobics class yesterday.  It was a great experience, and I would highly recommend them!  They also have a very extensive class schedule for every day of the week.  It really helps to be able to fit the classes into your schedule.  All the other studios I checked didn't come close to the amount of classes as Joyful Yoga.  Check them out online.

WARNING:  Beth lives in Crazytown!  My fiance and I have 4 houses, and I have used this company 6 times in the last 3 years. NEVER AGAIN!  The last time they came to my house for a service call, three days later my son was having the same problem.  After talking with them a couple of times, they finally said they would come back and redo it and only charge me about $40.  I was happy.  I gave them my credit card number since I was not at that property and they said they would charge my card.  I thought everything was done.  Several days later, my son called me and said they had charged his card for both services, AND had charged MORE the second time they came out than they had originally charged.  It had overdrawn his bank account.  I called Diamondback and they argued with me about the quote I had been given for the second appointment, and also admitted they had charged the wrong card.  They talked to a supervisor, called me back and said they would fix the charges.  I thought they were going to take the charges off my son's card and charge mine, but I'm not sure what they did.  TWO MONTHS LATER, I get a call from Beth (who is apparently the VP, and owner's wife).  She had first called my fiance and told him she was taking me to court because I owed them money and had I had reversed the charges on my credit card. HUH?  I called her myself and asked what she was talking about, I had never reversed anything.  Her response was "Oh, you never reversed your charges?  You never reversed your charges?  Well, I'll see you in court!"  Then she HUNG UP ON ME!!!  What?!?!?  My fiance called her back after I talked to him and she said that I had been yelling at her and used the F-bomb!  Then he just wanted to get this whole thing taken care of so he said he would bring them a check.  They said if he came to the office they would call the cops because they felt threatened!  It went on and on...needless to say, it was the craziest phone call either of us had ever received from a company, and I would never do business with them again, and will tell everyone I know the same.  MOST UNPROFESSIONAL BUSINESS EVER!!!!!!!

She is a great family practice doctor.  Whenever I needed to get in to see her, they always worked me in that day...which in my experience is almost unheard of with most practices in Phoenix.  She is very nice and easy to talk to.  She listens to what you have to say and I never felt like I was being rushed.  I would highly recommend her if you are looking for a doctor in the North Scottsdale area.
