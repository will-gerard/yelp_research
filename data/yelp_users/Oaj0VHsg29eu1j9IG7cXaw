I was in there to get a pair of glasses with my prescription. The two sales guys seemed helpful when I was the only one in the store, however, after a few women walked in they walked away without a word. They proceeded to wait on the women without any sign of returning to work with me. Guess I didn't have the right look. I don't have vision insurance so was planning on spending cash. So I went around the corner to another store where I received great customer service. I won't be back to Paris optical.

I've known Ivan for a while and every time I see him with his Chihuahuas they look so beautiful. He's told me many times that he could give my Miniature Australian Shepard's a great natural looking cut. Since, OMD grooming fees are higher than what I was already paying at a groomers that came highly recommended by a friend I hesitated to change.  However, Last week I had to have the dogs out of the house due to home repairs and their regular groomer wasn't available so I decide to take them to Ivan, at Oh My Dog. Max and Lily look phenomenal!!! They have never looked so good and totally worth the little extra money. I love the experience at Oh My Dog!   Everyone is friendly and helpful.  The homemade dog treats and merchandise are fantastic!

The food and service are beyond exceptional! They had a nice selection of wine. I had a red that was delicious. The creme brule' with fruit was maybe the best I've had. I'm looking forward to going back soon.
