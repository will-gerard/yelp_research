Hands down the best Pho in Phoenix! I'm a regular customer usually go about twice a month. I've tried other pho restaurants in Phoenix and they don't come close.

this location is absolutely horrible when it comes to customer service! i would never buy a pair of glasses from this place ever again.  actually don't go to any nation wide location, everyone is rude and talks back when it's not needed. when a company does not know how to use their own fax machine and it takes 4 hours to receive a prescription that is absolutely ridiculous.  when you are waiting 3 week for glasses and have not heard any thing and have to follow up yourself. then you come to find out they don't even have any order that was to be placed!!!!!!!!

I'll make this short and sweet.  I went to Orange sky for my anniversary after reading all the great reviews. The staff was friendly and very inviting, the views were quite spectacular. I would recommend if you are going for a special occasion to ask for a private table. The food was spot on the waitress was very attentive and kept a smile on our faces all night. Special kudos to AMY for being a fantastic waitress.

My dad and I stopped in here a couple weeks again to get a quick bite to eat. This place has become one of the most popular and talked about breakfast spots in Phoenix. Now that I finally got to try it I can taste why it had so much hype. From the customer service to the good and the decor everything was great. I can't wait to go back and try a different dish.

IOne of my co workers loves this place and decided to bring us some tacos. This has to be one of the best fish/shrimp tacos I ever eaten. I will defiantly be visiting this place in the near future.

My dad and I stopped in for breakfast this morning. We ordered two chorizo burritos and I must say this has to be some of the best I've eaten in a while. From the customer service to the food I would defiantly be back again. The women at the cash register was kind enough to bring us samples of the green and red chili. I would defiantly be back for both!

Decided to stop by this Vickie's before making the long drive back to Phoenix. I must say the food was great and so was the waitress, very tentative. I will defiantly be back when I visit Vegas. Thanks Vickie for the great service!

I have to say this is the cleanest and most professional barbershop I've been to around the Phoenix area. They offer quality haircuts at an affordable price with great customer service. Everyone in the barbershop does great hair, but Junior is my go to guy. If you are in the downtown area looking for a great hair cut stop in you won't regret it.
