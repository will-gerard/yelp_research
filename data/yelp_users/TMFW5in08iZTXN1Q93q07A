We shopped at numerous stores and ended up buying  at R&S Mattress! We continue to be happy loyal customers buying another mattress online from R&S! Thanks for providing a comfortable nights sleep and a custom mattress to fit both our needs for two people that like different comfort levels!

Love this wash, convenient and good value. My car always has water drops so the dryer works on about 90% of my car. I don't expect much better than that for a non-towel dry car wash. Vacuums really suck up all the crap! Thx roadrunner!

Jerk salad is small and not good. Maybe try a wrap? I am sure this place is best for wraps and smoothies not salads.

Most of the the furniture we received we did like although it was overpriced. We ordered custom tables and they weren't made correctly. We asked the owner for a refund or replacement and he said 'absolutely'. After talking to the owner a few times and a promise to replace the tables, we have yet to receive anything but false promises. Overall customer service was poor. We are in the market for new furniture again and plan NOT to shop here.

The steak was fabulous! I also recommend the beat salad (I prefer with no goat cheese), brussel sprouts and mushrooms! Watch out for the Parmesan bread- it's makes your mouth water! Also, if you are into dessert then our group loved the mini s'more and it's great for sharing!
