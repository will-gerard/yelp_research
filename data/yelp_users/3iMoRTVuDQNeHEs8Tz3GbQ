Great environment, the little Nanas are simply adorable as servers, food is actually pretty good too. This is my 2nd visit here and what SUBTRACTS significantly on what could be a GREAT EXPERIENCE, is the waiting & frustration that you sense from Restaurant  Management because they are not efficiently managing traffic -EVEN- when there's very little to no traffic.

Just stumbled upon a new favorite spot. This hidden little nook is 10-Stars.  Great food and ambiance. Kinda like a little secret you wanna brag about. Awesome!!! Family owned with a kick.
