I think this is the best BBQ in Arizona!!! I go to Texas all the time so I have had some great BBQ and I think that Bobby Qs is just as good if not better than Texas BBQ.

If you have Thyroid cancer run away from this place as fast as you can!!!!!!! This Dr is HORRIBLE!!!! If you ask me she is a scam artist who is trying to get as much money from her cancer patients as she can!

I read about Scramble on line so I thought I would go there for brunch and I loved it!! The Santa Fe eggs Benedict are amazing! The staff is friendly and the ambiance is incredible. I would highly recommend this place to anyone!!!

I am so stoked to have this place in Downtown my roommates needed to paint something last min on a Tues night and didn't feel like running to Home Depot and I had remembered seeing some at the Bodega so we ran there and it was so much easier than running to Home Depot. On a side note the Teeth painting are uber creepy me no likey!
