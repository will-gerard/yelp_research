Purchased a Groupon for Taps and I'm glad I did. For 3 people, our bill came out to be just a little under 5.00. We enjoyed the cool weather and sat on the patio (they could use a bit more lighting for when it gets darker). We ordered the bruschetta appetizer which had a nice tang to it from the balsamic vinegarette and lots of fresh cut tomatoes. I really enjoyed it! For entrees, we had the BLT, Chicken Ranch Salad, and Mushroom Swiss Burger. All delicious and priced well. The BLT and burger came with seasoned fries. My chicken ranch salad came with a bbq ranch that was amazing! Will definitely be coming back here! Our waitress was friendly, but just know that it is self seating. We stood around for a minute or two before the waitress came out and told us to feel free to sit anywhere we like.

I don't work far from here, so I like coming here once in a while for lunch. I always call ahead to order and when I get there, my food is always ready and waiting for me. I always take some of the lemon chicken and rice soup to go with me. I haven't had anything other than their Greek salad with gyro meat, which is delicious. The meat isn't dry nor fatty. It compliments my salad nicely and I love the soft, warm pita bread that accompanies my salad!

I was at a car wash place when this guy from this company asked if he could repair my chipped windshield. Having complete coverage I told him sure. He "filled" the chip and told me they guarantee their work and if the chip were to grow, they would replace my windshield. A couple weeks later I go to the same car wash and another guy approaches me about my chipped windshield. I told him not to bother because I had just had it repaired not too long ago. He flat out told me it didn't look like it had been properly filled. Fast forward one week later and my chip has now grown in to a 5 inch crack. I didn't bother to call this company to come back out and fix my windshield because of their shotty work the first time around. Instead I went with Safelite.

Came on a Sunday for lunch. Place was busy, but service was still great and timely. I like how the owner came around to make sure we had enjoyed our visit. Everything is made fresh when you order, so for two of us, it took about 15 minutes for our food to come out. The waffles are thin, but I think perfect sized for a sandwich...I wasn't sure if they would come out really thick and make it hard to eat my sandwich. I got the southern hospitality sandwich and my fianc√© got the Backyard BBQ. Both were delicious and I especially liked the spicy coleslaw and spicy syrup that came on the Southern Hospitality. We also tried the Asada fries which were perfectly paired with delicious gauc and sour cream. We will back again to try more!

So I have been coming to Sparkle Nails since they opened last year and it's always been my go-to nail salon. I came in today and found out new owners took over last month in December. All I have to say is wow! Tom, the new owner, is so funny and very personable! He really knows how to make his customers feel important and he did a fantastic job on my mani and pedicure. AND, this is now the first nail salon to offer complimentary margaritas, wine, and Pepsi while you are getting pampered! I love it! They also offer a reward program (which the old owner did not) as a customer incentive...so build up your points and when you reach a certain amount, you get $20 off your service. I'm very impressed with the new ownership!
