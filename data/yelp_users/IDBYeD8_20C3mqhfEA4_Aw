Very clean, polite wait staff, and manager was very nice. One of the cleanest Denny's in the valley and I recommend this location.

Had a great experience tonight even though it was rocky at first with a switch in server. Food took a while but they got busy pretty quick! It was delicious and good as always. Kristen took care of us after our first waiter did not come back and she did a great job! Attentive and great people skills. Thank you. We always continue to come back.

Completely unsatisfied with the service and food. The chili queso is thick and clumpy. As for the food, it had no taste! Will not recommend this place or go back.

Love this place! I just found out they are owned by PF Changs and that they are a fast food version. The mongolian beef is spectacular and Im very happy with the quality! The portions are perfect and the staff is always friendly.

What a wonderful bridal shop Azteca is! This is a family owned bridal shop and it is filled with beautiful wedding dresses and bridesmaid dresses. The staff was warm and welcoming while providing a friendly tour. Our stylist allowed us to pick out beautiful dresses and helped me get in and out of them. Their are [hundreds] of different dresses with so many styles and all different price ranges. When comparing this bridal shop to others they offer a wider variety of dresses, reasonable prices, all different famous designers, and top quality dresses. This shop deserves more wonderful reviews and you shouldn't steer away from them when finding your wedding dress! Give them a call!!

My fiancé and I come into Ajo Al's monthly. He enjoys the chicken and steak fajitas while I like the chicken enchilada with jalapeño cream sauce over the top. The hot salsa is his favorite and he asks for the larger one. The spinach queso dip is an awesome appetizer that everyone usually enjoys. We will continue to make this place our go to and we plan on coming here for the years ahead!

We will be back after a night of great service, delicious food, and a wonderful environment. Thank you to Tiffany (I believe), the manager for making sure my steak came out correctly. The medium wings were a perfect appetizer along side there brown bread. Lastly, the asparagus and broccoli were the perfect combination with my sirloin steak. We didn't leave hungry!

Talk about fresh orange juice, this place has transitioned into a very nice breakfast joint. It is remodeled with a very rustic feel. The customer service was great and the food had wonderful presentation. Keep it up First Watch, we will be back!!

This location deserves five stars! I dined in tonight for the first time and it was very apparent that they have a team effort going here. They were all enjoying each other and providing great customer service.  I believe the store manager was there and he was very nice also. The food quality over the years has gotten better with Mcdonalds and there presentation definitely showed that. This location was very clean and picked up. I enjoyed eating my dinner and watching the news on the TV. We will continue to come to this location!

The grooming salon is fantastic. Make sure you specify what you would like your pooch to look like. Kara does and exceptional job! Also Banfield Pet hospital does a great job, watch out for unnecessary medical costs and up selling. Veterinarian (Foster) does an exceptional job and truly cares about your animal and you as an owner.

I am absolutely satisfied with my first time visit. The place is very unique, well kept, and they make good quality sandwiches. I got the turkey breast and cheese and it was delicious. My next visit I will ask for more lettuce and extra pickles.  They only received 4 stars because the employees were not very friendly and they seemed very preoccupied with other things. With it being my first visit I was hoping for a Hello when walking in the door since the cash register is right there and for the lady making my sandwich to see my confused look and ask if it was my first time. Regardless, I will be back because they have great quality products.

This restaurant was very disappointing. The food was bland, the vegetable choices were limited, and the restaurant appeared to be very dirty. Id love to enjoy some Mongolian close to my home but for now I will drive all the way to YC's.

Been going to this place for a few years now and they do a phenomenal job. There food is fresh, hot, and delicious! Ive passed on the name of this restaurant to friends and they have also continued ordering from here. The Mongolian beef and peeking beef is very good. The chicken egg rolls and beef skewers are to die for! Don't miss out any longer, order!

The service was great as always! We started off with 3 pew pew platters. And we all shared entrees. The food was great, plenty left over, and we had no room for desert. The hot tea was perfect for a cold evening!

What an awesome restaurant to enjoy some time with friends or family! The vegetable items are fresh and they have a huge selection. The board of flavors has some wonderful selections and I would recommend the teriyaki sauce flavors. Don't forget the customer service is great! We will continue to drive 40 minutes to this place.

This morning was my first time hiking North Mountain and it was absolutely beautiful. I am very pleased with the trail and I liked that it was paved. With a few breaks to breathe, I made it to the top. I will definitely be back and hope to make it a routine to hike here.

I have plenty of mixed feelings about this location. I usually come through in the morning and ask for an iced coffee with french vanilla sweetened, one cream and NO sugar. Therefore, the fact that the last four times I have been here and got to my destination and had to throw my drink away is a little irritating. It seems to me like the drive thru worker can't hear me properly and the drinks come out different every time regardless if I order the same thing. All of there employees need to be on the same page about measurements because from here on out I will be trying every drink to make sure it is made properly before I leave.

My fiancé and I came in the other day to find him some new jeans and we received great help from Ryan. He was very attentive and was willing to help him find his size while folding the ones he did not like. This location is very nice and the staff has always been very friendly.

There is not a time where I am not disappointed with this place! The employees are rude and it wouldn't be normal for your food to come out right. Last night I received a chicken strip basket and it was missing dressing and the texas toast. I will be finding somewhere else to go!

I will never come back to this Dairy Queen and will continue to pass along to the public the horrible service I received 4 times. After discussing issues with a manager and her being completely incompetent this restaurant needs help. I feel bad for your future customers and will steer people away from going here.   -Cold Food  -Wrong Items  -Workers using profanity in the back -Unsanitary  -Unprofessionalism -Poor Management

This is a cool little spot! The food is delicious and all homemade. Happy hour has some awesome deals with half off appetizers and plenty of alcoholic beverages to choose from! The killarney chicken is my favorite entree and the corned beef and cabbage taquitos are a great appetizer also. You wont be disappointed so give Tim Finnegans a shot!!

Now I know why I do not come to this place. My fiancé just came home with our food and I ordered a rueben with bread to be extra toasted with an extra side of dressing. The bread was soggy, with barely any 1000 island on the sandwich, and no extra dressing. I will not be ordering from here again. This was horrible.

My second time here was another awesome experience. The ambience of the restaurant is whats so perfect! Which is followed by there delicious beef & broccoli entree and egg drop soup. The lunch portion is 4oz of meat with broccoli and rice which was perfect with chicken lettuce wraps as an appetizer. Our server was a very nice female who asked us about what we were doing for the holidays. She encouraged us to get desert and  we discovered that the raspberry cheesecake was awesome. We will definitely be back.

What a wonderful first time! The server was very nice and he was attentive an very suggestive with orders! The spicy chicken thai bowl and the chicken tacos were great!! The food is of great quality, fresh, nice presentation, and portioned nicely. I will definitely be back with some friends and what an awesome happy hour menu.

I have been here about four times and I would like to finally write a great review! Genghis Grill is a very inviting place with a laid back atmosphere. The restaurant is clean and the staff is very friendly. The quality of the food is very good and the final product is delicious. They have cards that will help you achieve the flavor you are looking for and they have a wide variety of vegetables, meats, and seasonings. I will be back because it is the closest thing to "Hu Hot Mongolian Grill" that is located in the midwest.

I have been wanting to come here for the longest time and this morning we had such an awesome experience here. The cafe is designed so cute and the staff is all smiles! We were sat right away, the waiter was very attentive and friendly. The mimosa's were delicious and strong. :) We ordered biscuits and gravy which were phenomenal and a side of french toast to share which was also delicious. You get a big portion and the food quality was great. Thank you too Sean for stopping by our table to make us laugh and make small talk, he was so nice! I definitely recommend this breakfast spot and I will be back! You won't leave hungry.

What an awesome experience at Federal Pizza! We came around lunch time and just had a 10-15 minute wait which wasn't bad. The server was very friendly, suggested great items, and food turned out great! I was hesitant because I just had an unpleasant experience at one of the restaurants next door but I am happy that I tagged along to try it out!! I will definitely be back :)

This was our second time at this location and it was such an awesome experience! Our servers name was Brandon and he was very friendly and explained things thoroughly. He suggested their "fireball" shot and it was actually pretty good! The place was extremely busy on a Saturday night but our food came out fast and we were never without a drink. The yard area was busy also but we made connections with others to get the gaming material when they were done. You just have to be friendly :) Anyways, you should definitely give this hopping spot a shot! And try out there delicious meatloaf and grilled chicken club sandwich!

This place is slowly crumbling. There are homeless people dumpster diving, riding around on their bikes and the hallways reek of marijuana. After living here for three years, I don't recommend this apartment complex to any individual. The front office lost a great employee after a couple years and its unfortunate that there are no more monthly newsletters like Veronica took the time to do. There needs to be some serious interventions at this apartment complex. Definitely, don't plan on renewing our lease. To end this on a positive note is the fitness center has greatly improved over the years!

A month back some girlfriends and I came in for breakfast we enjoyed our visit. We had to wait a while to be seated and the bloody marys could have been a little better but the service and food was great! A girlfriend picked the multiple types of pancakes and she thoroughly enjoyed all of them. I would recommend this place. They also have a huge breakfast burrito if your really hungry!

I didn't think I would ever have to write this but after coming here since the first day open to now the food quality has greatly decreased. After having many thing's off the menu and always giving it another shot, today's biscuits and gravy was the last straw for a while. The gravy was bland while adding so much salt, the potatoes had little flavor, and the biscuits were to hard to even cut with my fork. The atmosphere is great and I will give it another shot after the new year but my experiences continue to be no good. Hopefully other peoples experiences have been better than mine within the last year. I can't say I will recommend this place while I continue to see poor reviews, I am sure others are seeing what Im seeing after being a such frequent customer.

For a first time customer I was a little surprised and disappointed with my group of 6. We came at the beginning of happy hour (3PM) and sat on the patio. We ordered multiple appetizers, dessert, and multiple rounds of drinks. Our first round took 10 minutes and once the server saw us looking around she told us the bartender was short handed so drinks would be out soon. During our visit we had 4 different servers, one of them told us their name, and the others proceeded to help when they could. Once we received our tabs they were out of order and not correct.   -I asked the server why we were continuing to get different people, she said we came at an awkward time so everyone will be taking care of us. I am not sure if that was an appropriate answer.  -There was no visible manager on staff checking on tables. -The server laid our checks down before we were even done, one of the girls said are you trying to make us leave? The server replied with no I'm just giving you your checks, sorry. (When do you drop checks if we still have half of a beer?)   I do not plan on coming back any time soon due to the poor customer service and unfriendly staff. But thank you for good quality food and a great menu. Also, maybe consider getting beer that is allergy friendly.

I rate top golf a 4 out of 5 stars. We went there with a group of people and we had a two hour wait so we played the outdoor games by the bar/dj. It was Saturday night and it was packed. When it was time for us to golf and grab our spot the server came right over but could of been a little more attentive. We were charged a 1$ more for a margarita on the rocks, weird.. But it was a good evening and a lot of fun.

This location was well kept and the front office staff was friendly. The wait has been 45 minutes to an hour the last two times I have been here. You will also sit in the room waiting for the doctor for at least 15 minutes. One of the physicians did not knock on the door, she just flung the door open which was quite rude. I have not seen any other physicians in this office but I was happy with how my problem was handled. I recommend this place but just be extremely patient with them.

I want to clarify that I am not an employee or acquaintance of any owner when writing this review. I went on opening day and I was very satisfied when leaving. Yes there is music playing but it is an upbeat place full of employees who are enjoying themselves. The employees were very friendly and helped communicate with you when designing your pizza. The ingredients are fresh, the gluten free crust was delicious, and the place was clean. I will continue to tell people good things about MOD and I will definitely be back!

It is so exciting to finally have a Pei Wei by our home, yay! We came to this location for pick-up for the first time last night and it is so nice. The landscaping on the outside is beautiful, the inside is clean, and modern looking. We ordered our food online and it was ready at the time it said it would be. The food quality was just as good as any other location and it was still good by the time we got home. We will be back.

I was looking forward to eating here and I was thoroughly surprised by there quick ticket times for how busy they are and the quality of there food. I ordered the chicken sandwich was very good with a side of cheese fries. You must try the cheese fries!! I will definitely come back and i look forward to trying a burger and some ice cream. The only thing I would knit pick is the size of there small soda which is like a kids cup and the fact that they don't carry ranch dressing.
