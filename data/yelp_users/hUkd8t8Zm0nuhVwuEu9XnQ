I'm not a member of a gym but I wanted to take a look around and see what this one had to offer. When I asked the girl behind the counter if I could look at what they have she would not let me go in without filling out a bunch of BS paperwork. I'm sure it was so that some guy could walk me around, waste my very precious time talking about things I already know, and try to persuade me to join their gym. That's not what I wanted. I already had my decision made that if I saw the equipment I wanted to use that I would go ahead & join. I just wanted to run in & out quickly while I had a free minute to do so and check it out. Oh well, I figure I just saved myself some time and money with this place. I used to be with LA Fitness. They are wonderful! I think I may check out the Gilbert Rec Center & see what they have. I'm sure they won't mind me taking a look. If not, I'll head back to LA which I highly recommend.

Terrible. Terrible. Terrible. In every way this place is a hell-hole and it's terrible. Do not buy meat or produce from here. Take my word for it, you will be sorry. Customer service is non-existent. Cheap prices but it is never an easy in & out at this place. Over crowded with trashy people. I'm so sick of this place I just cannot go back. I've been to other Wal-Marts that are not this terrible.

I love Ned's Krazy Sub! There must be something about the bread that keeps me coming back. The place is clean and the food is awesome. My boyfriend really likes the old-school arcade game they have there. If you are into getting deals like I am, you can text their club number and they will send you coupons via text message from time to time. They do it regularly.

I'm not impressed by Ned's choice of staff lately. The last few times I've come in the ladies at the register have been rude and totally uninterested in what they are doing. This is the reason I haven't been in as frequently as I used to.

I've been going to Paws for over 10 years. Everyone is wonderful! Dr. Wendy Holst is amazing. I'm the type to be skeptical of if I really need all the tests etc but I trust them 100% which really says a lot. They are very reasonable on their fees which is a major plus! I have never found a better vet. Great care, prices and very trustworthy makes this place the very best in my book. It is also very clean.

This is not the same salads n such that I went to as recent as one month ago. They have raised their prices and changed their menu and a big way. I can understand raising the prices but what they did to the menu I think was a bad idea. They took my favorite sandwich off, got rid of sprouts completely, and the biggest problem is that you no longer get to choose two side items but only one. This place no longer stands out to me. There are too many other sandwich shops that I can go to. The decor is not good, I've been going to this place for many years and it never changes. At the end of my dining experience I tried to redeem my 10% discount for checking in on yelp but they said that that coupon shouldn't be on there. They did go ahead and give me the 10% discount though so that was nice. That will be my last time at salads n such because really they offer nothing different than any other place and now their prices are higher. Just not worth it.

This is my new favorite place to grab breakfast. On the weekends (both Saturday & Sunday) they have a breakfast buffet for about $10. It's a pretty awesome buffet that includes eggs to order, bacon, sausage, hash browns, corned beef hash, biscuits & gravy, pancakes (blueberry & plain) with a hint of cinnamon, French toast, bread pudding, yogurt, cereal, fruit, & donuts. There might be more but I can't remember right now. The place is clean, service is good and there's a great view of the airplanes & jets taking off & landing. There are also many model planes hanging which are pretty cool to look at.   The flight deck cafe is north of the terminal. I would definitely recommend checking it out if you're in the area.

This place has the longest wait times you will ever experience. Don't even attempt to go through the drive-through because you will spend at least 15 minutes waiting. There are plenty of other places nearby for me to go.

This place is a dive bar, as everyone else has mentioned. You should expect from this place what you would expect from any other dive bar: The bathrooms are not fancy or even nice, there are some old-fashioned TVs, the place could use a makeover, it's very small and gets very crowded at times. Will I come back to Champions? Hell yes! The beer is cheap and the people watching is fantastic. The people are so nice to talk to. It's within walking distance from me and it's right in downtown Gilbert.

Best dive bar ever! The service is always great and the beer is cheap. I have a special place in my heart for their fried shrimp. I will keep coming back here to watch football, chat with the regulars, play some pool or darts & relax.

This place is very small and gets crowded very quickly. It is a frustrating experience every time I go in there. People are standing around since there is little seating and the line goes right into the dining area. Too small! They are also pretty slow at getting the food out to the customers which is surprising since it's just a bagel shop. Their coffee is terrible, too.  The actual food is good. I get the Lox and haven't been disappointed, I just hate going in there to get it.

After living in these apartments for a year here is what I discovered:  I really like the area around here. I was able to walk to Freestone Park which was really nice, it is walking distance to a pretty good sushi place & a couple other restaurants, and there are lots of things in the area that make living here convenient. The apartments themselves are not much to speak of. The kitchen countertops are white and made of a material that absorbs ANYTHING wet that gets on it. Stir a cup of coffee & put the spoon down - stain, if your counter happens to be slightly wet and you put a grocery bag on it the ink from the bag will stain it, fruit stains it, some vegetables stain it, just about everything stains it. So if you're the kind of person who actually uses your kitchen for cooking then this may not be the place for you. The bathroom countertops are the same way. The carpet looks bad despite taking my shoes off on the tile entry and being very careful. I think it's just really cheap carpet. I've had water in my storage closet for about 6 months. They supposedly fixed the issue but I know it has not been fixed. I told them but nothing happened. I only keep a bike in there thank God or otherwise all my belongings in the closet would be destroyed. One day a maintenance person was walking around and asked me if he could look in my closet and I let him in. He said the whole wall needed to be knocked out. He said he would do it the next day and it wouldn't be an issue. Well, it never happened. So my mold-infested wall is still there, getting moldier. I also do not think there is a playground in the complex. If you have kids you may also want to rethink this place. Unless you don't mind them playing with the other kids in the complex who ride their bikes and scooters in the parking lot (be careful if you plan on using the parking lot to drive your vehicle in because they do not look out for cars), and who climb on the dumpster and the wall surrounding the dumpster. When I called to inform the office that there was a safety concern with the children playing in the parking lot WHERE CARS DRIVE I was told there was really nothing they can do about it.  I'm no genius, but I thought maybe they could inform the parents that their children are in harms way by riding bikes where 3000 to 5000 lb vehicles drive (some of which whip around the corners pretty quickly).

The prickly pear chicken sandwich, oh my God! So delicious. This place has great food. I always get the jalapeño and cheddar mashed potato pie as a side. If you like spicy food (really spicy) then you should definitely try the mashed potato pie. Sometimes I find myself craving the sandwich and potato pie combo. The service is pretty good. The place is clean and the people are friendly. Sometimes I just call ahead & get it to go. This place rocks!

I love this place. The food is awesome! I usually get the Country breakfast burrito. It has gravy & is pretty amazing!   The place is nothing to look at. I never actually stay and eat. I just order and go. To make it faster just call ahead to order.   The burritos come in smaller or shack size. I always get smaller and can never finish the whole thing. They are quite a good size for being smaller. The prices are really good, too. I usually get the hot & mild sauce with my burrito because I can't get enough. The hot doesn't have heat (it takes A LOT for me) but it's pretty good.   If you want something delicious for cheap & you're ok if the place isn't fancy then I recommend the shack.

I stopped in here for lunch today with my boyfriend. I haven't been here for several years because I moved away but now that I am closer I will be sure to stop by more frequently.   We ordered deep-fried zucchini for an appetizer which came out before our entrées. Our waitress wasn't satisfied with how they looked so she gave them to us for free. To me they looked fine and tasted pretty good. Either way, that's just damn good service.  My boyfriend had a half pound bacon cheeseburger which he said was really good. It was two beef patties on a toasted bun, super awesome crispy bacon and fresh veggies such as tomatoes, onions, lettuce and pickles. It comes with a side and he chose potato salad. He was not disappointed.   I had a club sandwich that came with a side as well & I chose the potato salad.  The club sandwich was really good and the potato salad was excellent. Their bacon has the perfect amount of crispness  (not soft & flimsy at all) that makes you want more! I am a bacon snob & they know how to do bacon.   We were the only customers in there but we were having a late lunch. The person who sat us at a table was also our waitress and she was very kind and attentive.  The decor is a western theme which is somewhat outdated however the restaurant is super clean and the bathrooms were clean as well.  We will definitely be back and will probably visit the sports bar/lounge that's right next-door and affiliated with this restaurant. On the receipt it said they have a hamburger and beer for six dollars. You can't beat that deal!

Their service is terrible. If you have the pleasure of having Kelli as your server then good luck. She made us feel like we were a burden to her so we left. There are way too many places to have a beer and watch the game with great service to have to deal with that.

Stopped in for dinner on a Friday evening. There was about a 15 minute wait for a table. They had an area out front to wait so it wasn't bad. The place was really busy which is a good sign I think. The service was wonderful. I had the mac n cheese and it was seriously the best I've ever had. I used to go to the House of Brews for mac n cheese but they are closed now and I'm so glad I decided to have it at Teakwoods because it is THE BEST! I will definitely be back soon.

whenever i visit this location my ice cream is always runny and melted. it took me less than 5 min. to drive home after ordering a banana split and by the time I was home it was melted. this locations sucks.  the one on Gilbert between Elliot and Guadalupe is much better. Never had problems there.

I bought my tickets through groupon for $14 each. Good deal! My family & I were going on a Sunday. I googled the waterpark to find out the hours. It said it opens at 10. As I was checking the website for what I can bring into the park i noticed it said 11. Then I checked the yelp reviews and yelp said they open at 10. I wanted to be there when it opened so I could get a shade area in the grass. At this point I was thoroughly confused so I decided to call and listen to the message. The message seemed to be updated since they posted the date and time their summer weekend hours started, which was 10. So we got there at 9:45. The parking lot was empty so I went to the front to see if hours were posted. On a chalkboard it said they are open at 11. As I was walking back to the parking lot someone who was operating a leaf blower told me it opens at 10. I explained that the sign said they open at 11 but he assured me they open at 10. I don't think he works for the company so I disregarded what he said. When I saw someone in a golf cart I asked him. He was wearing a big surf shirt so I knew he would have accurate information. He told me it opens at 11. I told him that I checked the phone message and that it said they open at 10. He shrugged his shoulders at me and said, "well, we open at 11."  He absolutely didn't care about the inconvenience that I had experienced even after I explained it to him. He was actually very rude to me then drove away in his golf cart. The general manager, Bob, is in serious need of customer service training. He does not care about the customer, customer satisfaction or his job.   Besides that, as soon as I entered the park I noticed that the trash cans were already completely full. It looked as though things were not cleaned up from the day before. The bathrooms were just disgusting. It was out of toilet paper but there was soap and paper towels. Each time I used the restroom I never once saw people wash their hands. They just walked out, which doesn't have anything to do with Big Surf but it just added to the feeling that this is a dirty place. My boyfriend told me that the men's bathroom was out of paper towels all day. No one went to clean or check on them for the entire day. The park looks like they need to do some major renovations.   The lines are not as busy as other water parks, so that's a plus. But there is also a reason why I suppose. I won't be back.

I've been going to Oregano's for years. It has always been fantastic. The wait can get ridiculous at times so I plan accordingly. But the last time I went it was less than stellar. To avoid the wait for a table (it was rainy and cold this day otherwise we would have taken the faster option of getting seated with first available) we chose to sit at the bar and eat. The waiter took the order of the couple sitting next to us and then took ours immediately after. Our neighbors received their order in the expected amount of time, however, our order did not come out until our neighbors had eaten and paid. This was a bit annoying since we were quite hungry and the orders were taken at the same time. They ordered a large pizza and salads. We ordered a small pizza and a order of wings (their wings are terrific fyi). So I didn't see what the hold up was. When we finally received our order I was not at all satisfied with the pizza. It didn't have the same crispy, delicious crust I was used to, but I am not the type to complain about the food unless there is something seriously wrong. So I just dealt with it. I went to the lady's room to sufficiently clean up the wing sauce and when I got back I overheard the waiter/bartender and my boyfriend talking. He asked how everything was and my boyfriend said the pizza was ok but the wings were great. The waiter left and we were visited by whom I think is the manager. She was an older lady and looked in charge anyway. She came, made some small talk and laughed with us for a moment, and then asked us about our experience. She heard our pizza was only "ok" and wanted to know what it was that only made it "ok." So I explained to her and she took what I said seriously. She also took the price of the pizza off the check which was not necessary at all. Although it had been a less than stellar visit to Oregano's I knew that I would be back again because all the other times I've been there have been wonderful. I was completely delighted with this experience because they really showed that they care about what their customers think and they care about their experience with them. I recommend checking it out! Also, do not pass up the pizzookie (pizza cookie), it is to DIE for! yummmmm!

This is the slowest pharmacy ever. They go from one phone call to another completely ignoring the customers who are waiting in person. They quote wrong wait times which are often doubled. I'm not sure what makes them so much slower than other pharmacies.

I like this location because they always get my order right and if I park and order they are usually really quick. The drive-through tends to take a little bit longer so I always just park instead. I try to come during their happy hour between 2-4 to get half price drinks. I always order a cherry limeade with easy ice. Most places will throw a ton of ice in even if you ask for easy ice but this place doesn't!

My friend and I met here for a drink. I'm the coffee drinker so I ordered from Coffee Rush and she got something from Jamba Juice. As we were talking and drinking our drinks one of the employees gave my friend a cup and told her she either had to drink the rest of her drink quickly & throw away the cup or pour it into the coffee rush cup so if his boss came in he wouldn't know it was an outside drink.   Wow. Is his boss a Coffee Nazi? This really seems to be such a trivial thing to do to your customers. I'm sure It's A Grind won't mind the added business & won't care if someone brings in a smoothie to drink with their coffee-drinking friend. I will not be back.

I love this place. I feel like everything is fresh and it just feels good to eat good food. I have found my favorite thing on the menu so far is the Roast Beef & Gorgonzola sandwich. It is soooo good. Also love their tea. Always clean, food comes out promptly, and I love to sit outside and say hi to all the doggies that come to sit on the patio.

This is my very first Yelp review and I'm writing it to save others the experience I just had. I just ate at Teharu for the first time. Everything was going well, the sushi was pretty decent considering their awesomely cheap prices. The service wasn't the best for sure but my boyfriend and I were totally enjoying the experience....UNTIL....a nasty cockroach crawled right up the wall in front of me and made its way onto a ceramic jar sitting on the counter in the kitchen. No one noticed it, not even when the sushi chef stood in front of it to wash his hands. It crawled in and out of the jar and all over the counter top. My boyfriend and I took pictures of it and still no one noticed. Since our appetites were completely gone at that point (there was no way were going to finish the rest of our sushi) we asked for a manager. There was no manager working so I asked for a supervisor. A lady came to us and asked us what we needed. When we told her she just walked away from us and told another employee to come talk to us. He came over and I told him what happened and he just said, "Oh, really?" So they gave us our check, we paid, and that was the end of it. There was no apology or anything. It was disgusting to say the least. One would think that having a kitchen open in everyone's view would tend to be a little cleaner, but after closer inspection I noticed that the glass surrounding the kitchen was very nasty and obviously hadn't been cleaned in some time and I could only imagine what the floor looked like beyond the glass right where the roach came from. I wouldn't have even given them one star but I guess Yelp requires at least one star.  Take a look on Maricopa County's Environmental Services website regarding this restaurant. http://www.maricopa.gov/envsvc/envwebapp/tabs/results.aspx?navigatedFrom=businessResultsDrillDown&mc_perm_id=217877&business=HARU%20SUSHI&address=9845%20%20%20S%20%20PRIEST%20DR&permitid=SG62199

I see that this place is still as filthy as it was when I wrote my first review. It made CBS channel 5's dirty dining list tonight! In fact, they were the dirtiest of them all with a whopping 12 major violations from the health department. Wow. The news said if they do not correct they may get shut down. I think this would be a good idea and could keep people from getting sick.

What a joke! It's 4:30 AM and I went through the drive-through at Krispy Kreme's because it's the only thing open. Being that it is 4:30 AM I am in serious need of coffee right now. So I go through the drive-through and I pull up to the menu. There is a paper sign taped to the menu stating that because of machinery malfunction they can only serve glazed doughnuts. Fine. That's usually what I get anyway but lame for anyone who wants something different. Then when I put my order in for a large latte I am told that they cannot make any lattes because their machine is down. Okay, very inconvenient. I asked if they could make any iced coffee drinks at the moment. She said they don't have coffee right now it'll be seven minutes. Absolutely unacceptable! I drove off and found a QT.

I went here to buy a couple things and ended up getting some baklava as well. The sign said $8.99 per pound or $1.99 per piece. The man who runs the place told me there is about 6 pieces per pound so I decided to go with that. He said that it's cheaper going with the pound rather than buying piece by piece. After picking out my 6 pieces I did some more shopping. When I came back to pay he told me the baklava costs $13 and some change. I asked him how it came out to that price and he said it ended up being a pound & a half. I never saw him weigh it. The price he charged me was even more than the individual price. He's not the nicest guy to deal with and he's the only person I've ever seen running the store. The baklava isn't that great to want to come back for it. There are many shops in the same area to go to that won't rip you off. I won't be back.

I'm still thinking of this place a month after my first experience here. I absolutely loved Fogo de Chao! If I could change anything about my experience I would have skipped the salad bar altogether and just eat the meat and the sides they brought to the table. My absolute favorite was the petite filet and their house sirloin. The service was top notch and could not have been any better.   I was here for my 2 year anniversary and they gave us a dessert for free. We had the Tres Leches cake which was phenomenal!   I can't wait to go back!

I've been coming to Higley Hotdog for at least eight years and the quality has always been awesome! I have never been disappointed. The place itself is like a small little shack type joint, definitely not fancy. The food is fantastic as well as the customer service. It's been the same people every time and they're wonderful! It's cash only!

I called in an order tonight for a pesto lavish turkey wrap and spicy chicken wrap. When I got it home I realized that I did not get the turkey lavish wrap but something different and my boyfriend's spicy chicken wrap was a complete mess. Getting an order correct is very important especially if people are picking it up to go and won't realize they have the wrong thing until they are already home. Very frustrating. We won't be back.

This is the best ice cream place I've been to. The ice cream is so creamy. The flavors are great, too. My favorite is chocolate birthday cake batter. They make it there from their own dairy farm, Superstition Farms. They also have random flavors that they create like Lays potato chip. You can try all the flavors!

I really like their happy hour specials here. It is really reasonably priced and delicious. The only thing that sucks is having to look for a table yourself in the bar area. The bar area is the only area you can get the happy hour specials. Get ready to throw elbows for a seat.

I came here for my birthday dinner and was sat after only a two or three minute wait. Then we just sat at the table while nobody noticed us whatsoever. I ended up leaving because no one would even acknowledge our existence. I called them up to let them know that I had left and that no one had even asked us what we wanted to drink and the man who answered the phone just said, "ok." No apology, nothing at all. Their prices did were not great either. Needless to say I will not be back because I don't care for being ignored.

This place is usually my go to place if I want sushi. It's good sushi at a good price. I always leave full and satisfied. They bring you miso soup and a salad before the sushi comes out. At the end of the meal they also serve you free dessert. The service is always good, the place is clean and the food is good. Damn, I think I might have to go tonight. Yum!

This place has great food at a good price. The portions are huge enough to share which makes it super cheap. I had been here several times and the only complaint I had was the iced tea, it was terrible. They could also add a little more heat (spice) to their dishes, but not a big deal.  The last time I went in was a really negative experience. I ordered the orange chicken with white rice and an extra order of the white rice. All was fine until they brought out the orange chicken with no rice at all. They said they didn't have any white rice. I'm not sure why they didn't tell me that from the beginning especially since I asked for an extra order of it. The problem was this, they had plenty of white rice but since so many people call their orders in and pick it up, they gave the rice to them. They had the rice that I ordered, I know this because my sister-in-law (whom I turned on to this place) actually came in when my food was delivered to the table without the white rice. I ended up just leaving the place after paying for my crab puffs and I text my sister-in-law to see if they got white rice. Yep, they sure did.   It is not good business to do that sort of thing. They are a Chinese restaurant...you would think they would have enough white rice, but I guess not. It didn't seem like they understood the problem. They said sorry and that was the extent of it. Haven't been back since.

This place is really inconsistent. You might get a decent job one time, but the next time it's crap. Lately, the crap jobs outweigh the decent jobs. If you do go here, buy the Groupon first which makes the price more reasonable. The last two times I've been here I have asked for no Armor All to be used. They guy told me they could use a towel that's damp with water. They ended up putting Armor All on it both times. They do not respect the customer's wishes. I called and talked to the manager, Mario, about it and he said I could take it back in and they would use soap & water to wash off the Armor All. I expected he would at least offer some type of compensation for their mistake on two occasions but not so. I told him that I would take it off myself & that I was not close to the car wash anymore. I didn't think it would be worth it to drive all the way back just to have them clean it with soap & water. They charge extra to vacuum out the trunk on my car which I found strange. I told Tyrone that I didn't want the vacuum on the trunk but he sold it to me anyway. When I got to the cashier she told me he put it on the slip & I told her to take it off. My boyfriend bought the Groupon & got his car done a few weeks ago. They didn't even touch the dash. When we got into the car it was dusty as hell. I've decided I won't be back, not even with a Groupon. I think it will be better if I just washed the car myself, then at least I'd get exactly what I asked for.

ZERO stars! Seriously, do yourself a favor and find another imaging center. I was told by my doctor's office to call this place to schedule an appointment for my ultrasound. I did so and was on hold for 29 minutes before I hung up. I called back, selected a different option in hopes of getting a hold of an actual person which worked; I got a hold of someone at their central office.  I explained my situation and she said she would try to call them. She waited for 27 minutes and then came back on the phone with me and said she didn't know what they were doing or why they weren't answering and she didn't know what to tell me. She said she held the line until it actually hung up on her. I told her I guess I would have to go to a different imaging place and she agreed and apologized because she said there was nothing she could do for me.

I've based my 5 stars on one visit to Zinburger. I had the best turkey burger I've ever had. It was so juicy and delicious. My boyfriend had the Zinburger which he said was also delicious. We also had two shakes. The Zinbar shake was awesome and the bananas foster shake was thick and so yummy! The service was good and the deal (2 burgers & fries for $20) was great! I wish there were a location closer to us in Gilbert.

I come here for the buffet and it is always on point. The service is great and they never leave you needing anything. The price is about $10 per person which is not a bad deal. The mango lassi comes with the buffet so I usually drink some of that and water. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves Indian or to anyone who wants to try it for the first time.

Went in for lunch today. Ordered the curry chicken for takeout. This was my first time here but I saw the good Yelp reviews so I knew it was safe.   Dayum dayum dayum! I like my food spicy and they did it right! The curry chicken is pretty fabulous. There are pieces of fruit in the sauce, the chicken tastes great and the rice was so delicious and fragrant. Can't wait to go back!

My boyfriend and I stopped in for some subs one night. We had a coupon and it was a good deal. The place is clean, the staff are very friendly, and the food was pretty good. The bacon on my sandwich was actually crispy which I don't often find at other sub shops. The guy who rang me up at the cash register was super nice. He threw in a couple free cookies when I told him it was our first time there which was pretty cool. I think more places could benefit from having someone like him working with customers. All in all, I will be back!

The staff is friendly and the place is clean. But the sandwiches...oh dear, they are so so yummy! I honestly don't think I've had a better sandwich than the ones at this place. The one I get is the Firehouse Hero.

Tried to have Jimmy John's delivered tonight. Their delivery radius is so small that even being 1.34 miles away is too far for them. That must be how they have such fast delivery. They also lose customers quickly since they won't expand their delivery area. I'm sure another place will appreciate the business.
