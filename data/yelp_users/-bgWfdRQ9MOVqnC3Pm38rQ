Best old dive in town! Those lights during the holidays! The bartenders are great. Drew is great! Charles is great! Just an old fashioned bar in the southwest! If you end up in the Phoenix area, visit Scottsdale and get in there!

Just go and have the best coffee in town and shut up about hipsters, uncomfortable chairs, not enough wall outlets, and the fact that they market specialty coffee. That is why they don't want to put flavoring in your coffee. They take pride in the unadulterated product. If coffee isn't your thing, go to Dutch Bros.

I walked in and felt like I was in the bar scene of The Gremlins. Chaos.  Started my order. First, out of boba. Ok, fine. I'll have a Thai tea. Nope, the whole tea bar is closed. Why? She didn't tell me that to start. That would've been a little more ok.  Ramen order. Out of egg. Why? That's ridiculous. Who is managing this place? There was a written list of items that were not available taped to the register. Weird.  Counter help walked away to do something else while I was in the middle of my order and with a line of people behind me.  Saw the kitchen from the counter. Looked like a disaster with a couple of guys working that looked like they had not a clue what they were doing.  Ended up walking out. Will not go back.

This place ruined the Deltron show. The venues shape can't support a show this size, despite adding a second show. It's just going to be a repeat of the same problem. The sound is awful. There is nowhere to sit, which I was forced to do because the show wasn't enjoyable for the reasons stated above. The only place to sit is a solitary couch. Not kidding. WTF? This place should be banned from booking shows like this. I gave it a chance because Deltron 3030 was one of my favorite records ever released, but after experiencing it first hand, I'd rather skip the next show that comes through here, even if it's an artist I absolutely love. Thanks for nothing.

Joyride has been a staple in our Lyft driver community! The food is great and has been able to accommodate our large group on many occasions with ease! We all appreciate your excellent service. I enjoy all of your other restaurants as well!

Lyft is an absolutely amazing transit solution in any city, especially phoenix. At the click of a button, you can have a friendly ride at your side in minutes. Much faster and more efficient than any other mode of transportation, including owning a car!
