Super nice staff and they are really good with the pedicure. I enjoy this place and would def come bAck again. Clean establishment and lots of staff here to cut back on the wait time.

My nails were amazing and so were my eyebrows. The only complaint is that staff were not talkative even when I initiated the conversation. Would still go back since they did great with my nails. Maybe a different nail tech.

Great experience for sure. Christina is an amazing optometrist and has a background in billing/coding. Very nice and personable. My insurance is an all inclusive and she worked with me and the insurance for the best rate. Go here and she can help.

The first time my group and I went it was a blast the owner was super nice. We went again this past Friday and the service was terrible. He was rude. We paid 10 bucks. Person the first time and then he upped it to 20 bucks saying "i was being nice". We asked for water and he said "go get it yourself". Was in our faces for no reason and we just left. Because of the wishy washy service we left and went to Hubbly Bubbly in Tempe and it was amazing and great service. Not to mention no wishy washy service.

I just recently moved to Maricopa and was told to try this place and that it was amazing but in reality it was not. I ordered my meal with a side salad that was very old, whilted, and on its way out the door. The waitress knew and still served it to me and when I asked her she said "oh it did look different". The meal my in laws got the bread was rock solid and the food was cold. We overheard the waitress telling another customer that " we just reheat the food here". To top it off we all got sick. This is not a place that I would recommend nor ever return to.

I love this place. This is a local owned place and his son also does the work. Muralt was so amazing and extremely helpful in making sure my ring fit my finger. The price was reasonable and I would highly recommend that anyone who needs all Jewerly repair or even purchases to come to this place.

Customer service was amazing. Waiter was super friendly. With this place you can special order which I liked. The sushi was "okay". I would come back if I was in the area. I def did not have to wait 45 minutes like I did with another sushi place so it was worth it.
