As I am now learning from reading other poorly-rated reviews, my experience with this location was similar to others'.  A girlfriend and I bought this Groupon together, as we expected to enjoy a relaxing time following work.  We had difficulty booking our appointments in April, and ended up having to reserve a slot from a month out.  I am religious about writing everything in my planner, and had specifically recorded the appointment at 6:45pm.  However, the day prior to our scheduled time, the salon called to confirm, stating that their book recorded "6pm".  As my girlfriend does not work in the area and would be unable to make it by this time, I stated that I was certain the time was set at a quarter to 7; the woman on the phone did not budge or apologize.  I decided to keep my appointment to attend without my girlfriend, as it was so difficult to get the slot in the first place.    The day of the appointment, I was called at 9am and told that the books had gotten mixed up and the woman on the phone wanted to know if I could move my time that day up to 5pm.  My schedule was flexible that day, and my friend had already confirmed she would not be able to join me for the earlier appt., so I agreed.  When I arrived at the location, I was shocked to find that it was in a strip mall, rather than the resort I had expected. An  $87-value seemed congruent with Hilton, however, the business title is merely derived from the owner's surname.    I was sat at a station promptly, and a  woman who was not my nail technician (I am presuming it was the woman who had called me to reassign my appointment time earlier that day) thanked me for my flexibility with the booking mishap.  I have had many manicures- all of which included soaking of my hands, massages, lotioning and cuticle oil.  Krystal was my nail tech and did not attempt any of the above.  During this time, a man selling candies and trail mixes arrived and brought all his products out.  Krystal was so uninvolved with my service that she excused herself for several minutes while she decided which items she wanted to purchase.  She returned to complete my manicure and made little attempt to connect with me as her customer.  I found the polish to look satisfactory when she had completed it.    I was led to another section of the salon for my pedicure and instructed to fill out new customer paperwork while she worked on my feet.  My leggings were not the best choice, but the bottoms were not close to the bath.  Krystal insisted on tugging them up my calves until that point that I found my circulation was limited.  As I was filling out the requested paperwork, I mistakenly smudged a not-yet dry nail (it had been 20+ minutes, and though it was not Krystal's fault, it was not mine, either).  When I brought this to Krystal's attention, she attempted to fix it, but to no avail.  I was told I could wait in the chair for my feet to dry and Krystal would tend to her next appt.  I was never instructed when would be appropriate to move, and soon Krystal returned to tell me- hurriedly, "Sorry, but I need to clean this bath!"  At this point, I was still flustered over my smudged nail and feeling like neither a customer or a priority- I felt too frustrated to ask again for it be corrected and considered just leaving.  Fortunately, Courtney- a stylist, and self-proclaimed "perfectionist"- took the time to remove and repaint the polish.  I did not see Krystal for the rest of my appointment.  I've since noted that all other negative reviews for Compliments correlate with having purchased a Groupon.  If, indeed, regulars do attend this spa, certainly it is not noteworthy enough to receive a higher rating, as none have been given for the services described. After my stressful experience, I would not consider returning, nor would I refer others looking for a relaxing occasion to this establishment.

I stumbled upon this treasure using my AroundMe app one night when my boyfriend and I were looking for delivery Chinese.  My family and I have been frequenting Shangri-La in the Metrocenter area for over 20 years and this may have topped it! Queen's Bowl checked all our boxes: option for delivery, authentic taste, soup available, and at a most valuable price.  We will make this a regular spot.  An absolute must!

Happy hour here is absolutely incredible! My sister used to work here in high school (I know, I know. Token Caucasian server)- needless to say, I have been coming here a long time. Blue Flame and Super Mussels are unlike anything I have ever eaten! Today I was planning on meeting a friend here and she tried to cancel on me. Because I had been looking forward to it all day and he had given me sushi blue balls, I went before happy hour ended, ordered amazingly-priced rolls and convinced my friend to come meet me. Probably the fattest thing I have ever done but I'm sharing with you to prove a point- the food and the deal here is just THAT worthwhile.

When I began wedding planning 13 months before our nuptials, the goal to create a unique party atmosphere, resembling that of a club.  What I thought I had invented- music video backdrops and state-of-the- art lighting effects- we found in The Beat Booth.   My husband and I met Erica and Nathan at a bridal show, and immediately joined in my excitement for a techno version of "Hava Nagila" for our Jewish Hora and obsessive amounts of Britney Spears tracks (which I wanted played every 5 songs, so that I could just stare at the screen and oogle). Once we had decided that they fit the vision for our Desert Botanical Garden winter wedding, they were flexible with our budget to provide us the extensive equipment needed for an event of 250.  Additionally, they were prompt in responding to emails and met with us several times to go over specific details- including at our venue, where they took copious notes. They went over-the-top to help us save, by providing microphones for our service, speakers for our cocktail hour, speaking with our event coordinator for our venue to link the projector, and connecting my husband's keyboard to their system for a very special performance of his vows that he wrote in a song.   The aspects that we would have changed worthy of 5 stars were probably unnoticed by the guests.  We were specific about our expectations going into coordinating, and it seemed that Nathan and Erica had full understanding and we trusted they would match the types of music suggested. My husband provided Nathan with independent music for our cocktail hour and dinner, none of which was mainstream to the point of hearing on the radio, however, during dinner, I did hear some Top 40 songs.  In watching our wedding footage, we recognized that some of the older music to open the dance floor was cheesy (i.e. "Oh, What a Night," and "Twist and Shout", when we would have preferred more Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston, and Lionel Richie).  Our middle-aged guests looked to be enjoying themselves, and we may have been more specific with our expectations when talking about what we did not want.  Additionally, a country song was played as a slow dance; this did not fit our demographic that well, as our families are from Boston and Minnesota. Lastly, when we were introduced to dance our choreographed song as husband and wife, the wrong Jason Mraz song was cued.  Nathan and Erica both apologized and amended the situation quickly.  Our large crowd required more assurance from our VJ with making announcements and maintaining time specifications, for example, no one was aware the we were cutting the cake as it was not presented in the most assertive manner possible. Our guests had much positive feedback and stayed later than we would have projected of a Sunday night wedding, and I wholeheartedly believe this was related to our unmatched entertainment. My biggest regret was that because we were running behind with speeches and dinner. we didn't have more time to dance and party with our guests!
