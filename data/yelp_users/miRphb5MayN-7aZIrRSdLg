I'd say pretty average Mexican food. You do get bean dip with the classic chips and salsa. We had a brand new waitress, so service was pretty slow and our bills were wrong. Overall, meh. I probably wouldn't rush back to this place if I find myself in AZ again.

Maybe I'd appreciate this place more if I drank, but I don't know. The food was very average and to be quite honest, overpriced in my opinion for what we got. I get that it's Las Vegas and right on the strip, but to me, I didn't think it was worth the money. We got seated right away and waited quite a bit of time each time the wait service came to our table to order, deliver food, bring checks, etc.

We went here twice on our short stay in AZ. Bowls were a refreshing and healthy option on a hot AZ day. Lots of bowl choices and the menu outlines exactly what's in the bowl and what each bowl is topped with--that was nice. I had the Blackberry Walnut and Raspberry Lime. Both good. Bowls are huge, and I'm pretty sure they're bigger if you choose to stay. We got mediums both time but one time to go and one time to stay and the bowl seemed to be way bigger when we stayed and ate in the store. Prices are average for an acai bowl.

The menu is incredibly small, like three types of tacos small, but the tacos were filled with flavor. The set up was kind of weird--there's a drive through as well as walk in dining, and the same person was doing the drive thru orders and taking orders with walk in customers (it was pretty confusing and weird). However, staff was really friendly, prices were reasonable and service was fast.

This hotel was a pretty convenient location when you need to be in Phoenix, Gilbert and Tempe all within the same weekend.   I booked it through Expedia so prices were fine. I requested an early arrival and when I got there they said nothing was available and to check back in an hour. My friend and I went and got lunch and an hour later when we checked back there still wasn't anything available, so I asked if I could leave my phone number and if they could call us when a room was ready and they said sure but we can't guarantee that we'll call you because that "isn't a priority". So we left (again), came back an hour later, nothing was available, so we waited in the lobby until our guaranteed booking time. I get that a lot is dependent on an early check-in, but the staff was pretty unhelpful and aloof.   It's pretty obvious that this site was not originally a Double Tree, but rather they took it over and didn't really upgrade it much. There's no overhead lighting in the rooms, only a few dim lamps. Hardly any outlets, so if you're traveling with people and they each have one or two electronics, plan to charge in shifts. AC unit is incredibly loud but since it's AZ you need to keep it on or you'll roast.
