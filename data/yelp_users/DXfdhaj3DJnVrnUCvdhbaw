I loved this cute breakfast/brunch place!! The service was outstanding and the servers were very nice and helpful. I tried 'the princess' omelet and it was really tasty. I don't really have anything bad to say about this place. I would definitely go back.

I went with my parents on a Tuesday night around 8 pm and it was not very busy. We were seated right away and the hostess was very nice and made sure we got seated where we wanted. The server was very helpful and answered all questions we had very effectively. He was an awesome and  very polite guy with an outstanding personality. The food was very fresh and tasted very good. The great atmosphere of the restaurant made us have a wonderful time and we would definitely go back.

DON'T EVER GO HERE FOR ANYTHING!!! ITS TERRIBLE!! I got a regular oil change here and they broke something while doing that and didn't tell me. When I checked my car a couple days later I went back to complain and he finally admitted to me that he knew it was broken and he forgot to put it on my receipt!! What liars !!! AVOID This Place !!!

Best sandwiches ever! I tried The Earls Club and it was bomb! I had to wait in a long line at 4 am but it only took 10 min to get my sandwich! Would definitely recommend !

My fianc√©e has been getting his hair cut by Lawrence for 3 years and he is the best male haircut in Phoenix.  Not only is he a personable guy he is helpful and is willing to listen to the way you want your hair.  He works around my schedule and has a nice studio at his house.  He has also cut my hair and has techniques I haven't had other stylists use before!
