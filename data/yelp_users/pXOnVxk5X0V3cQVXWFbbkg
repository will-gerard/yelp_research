Today was my first time here,  it's quite a drive from my central phx home,  but it's worth it.  The pizza and wings are delicious, the hot and honey hot wings are delicious and crispy.  This will be our new to go place.  I can't wait to try the happy hour at the bar.  :) I'll be definitely going back.

If your looking for cheap drinks & long boring drag shows,  well Charles is the place to go. if you live close to the light rail,  just get off at 7th Ave & Camelback.

One of the best hole in the wall Chinese food Resturant. The egg drop soup is delicious & the orange beef is to die for,  if you haven't tried it do so.  The kung pao chicken & garlic shrimp are so delicious.

This is still one of the best places to come and grab a good lunch  or dinner. The prices have gone up but it is good and worth it. If you want to eat a decent price go for there lunch hour specials .

Okay from me and my spouse opinion,  the wings and pizza that we order here were not good there are a lot better choices out there to get wings and pizza.  The staff was great and nice tho.

Great place to grab a good burger.  The lobby is always open and usually clean.  But just like every other whaterburger they take a while to cook your fresh food so it worth it :)

i do enjoy going to fuddruckers, the food is good and the staff keep the place clean. I like how much condiments you can put on your own burger. i have not had a problem in the past 4 years that i have been going here.

The deep dish pizza is pretty good,  despite the reviews I guess it's one of those places that you have to try you either like it or you don't but in my opinion it was pretty good.

This Costco is great and clean. The only thing that sucks is the parking I wish they also had more shaded parking.

okay, let me tell you about Fogo De Chão, this Brazilian Stakehouse is the best piece of meat I ever put in my mouth. OMG this place is beyond delicious. Me and my friends ate here for lunch on Monday 1/18 for my birthday. We were all amazed on how delicious the food was, they also have a great salad bar.  I dont know about everyone else, but i will defiantly be back to eat here at Fogo De Chão.  FYI: The host and staff were great and friendly.  also keep in mind they charge per bottle for coke products, my friend found that out when he got his bill for drinking 4 cokes lol....   Note*  1st time eating here, try out the lunch hour because it is decently price for about $30 a person, dinner goes about $50 a person, but it is worth ever dime for unlimited choices of meats that came around our table during the entire time we were there..  :-)

This rallys had bad service right now,  hopefully the service improve fast people have been waiting 15 + min for their food & make sure to check your orders before you leave,  they gave me the wrong order when they said it was the correct one.

the rally's employees need to learn how to step up their game & work together and get food out timely. It's just seem like they don't have very bright people working at this location
