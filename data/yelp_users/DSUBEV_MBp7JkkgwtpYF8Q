I am in love with this place! I always tell people about this place and the thing i tell people the most is that beyond the food, i really enjoy the people who work there. I have been working near by for the past year and every time i go in i am greeted by everyone! Everyone is so warm and welcoming! It keeps me coming back and taking my friends. Once they messed up an order and the next time i went in they had a free sandwich waiting for me! Everyone knows my name and i feel more than just a customer. On that note, there is one person in particular who has gone above and beyond for me. His name is Jason and many who have seen us interact think that we have been friends for a long time. The truth is that we met at the duck. Not only do i trust him as barista but now he is my confidant. When my day gets overwhelming from work, i go visit him and he does not hesitate me whip me up an herbal tea blend or a special coffee to always put a smile on my face. He is an escape from my daily routine, its almost as if i am visiting an old friend. I highly recommend this place, and i will continually return. Thank you to all the staff who strive for excellence.

By far the best ever!! Took my pug in for surgery and I know my girl was well taken care of. During the surgery they found baby teeth that needed to be taken out and when I told them I couldn't afford it, the vet took them out anyway at no extra charge!! They gave me all the post operation information I needed. They offered on call information.. I can't even describe how above and beyond this place is!! Thank u to all the wonderful staff.. Me and my pup are grateful!!

Service was absolutely horrible. The waiter barely spoke to us. I felt like I had to beg him to do anything. No one asked if we wanted water.. Had to flag the guy down. Then I made the mistake of ordering more chips and had to ask several times for the waiter to bring them out. When he finally did he looked annoyed w me. He never asked us how our food was. The final straw was when it came time to pay, I told him we were paying separate and then he let out this long sigh that included his lips flapping loud as if I asked him to do the hardest thing in the world. I didn't want to leave a tip.. Because that's how bad it was.. But ultimately I couldn't do that. I just won't come back. I didn't feel welcome in the first place.

I really like this place but have always had crazy experiences there. In November I took my dad there for his birthday, my sister who is vegan ordered a salad without cheese. They bring her the salad with cheese of course. She asks them to take it back, they finally bring it when everyone is almost done.. And she takes a first bite and finds a bug in her food. After that she didn't want anything. There was no discount offered at the time of our service either. So last night I give it a try again. And again everything came out wrong. The server offers different hot sauces and my friend orders one only to have their server come back and say we only have this one. They brought us our pizza and they didn't even slice it for us. I ordered Mac and cheese and it was all burnt. The server apologizes and says the cooks are trying to close up... We were the last ones. Like I said I really like this place.. They are just always messing stuff up. So because they mess up all the time and we found a bug in our food and no compensation u get 2 stars PPP. Try and get it together!
