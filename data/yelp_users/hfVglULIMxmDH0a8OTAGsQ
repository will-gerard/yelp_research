The desk clerk at the Courtyard Marriott recommended this place. I told her I wanted local and I got local. I nearly screamed with delight when I saw the menu. Red Chili Menuedo, Calabacitas, and Albondigas Soup. I cannot wait to get back to Phoenix to take eat more of the delicious morsels. I had the Albondigas Soup and I really enjoyed the extra surprise of carrots, zucchini, and squash.

Was in Phoenix this week on business and had my favorite soup.  It is still YUMMY!!!  I love this place!

I am very picky about salads since most salads I had from restaurants have been very flavorless or the veggies were sub-par.  I went to Sauce today with high expectations...a good salad.  I ordered the Chicken Pinenut Salad which was great.  The workers were courteous, and it did not take too long to get my salad.    On my next trip to Gilbert, AZ I plan to pay them another trip and try one of the pizzas.

This Marriott meets my needs based on its location to the business sites I need to visit. My only issue id the parking which can be sort of iffy and unsafe at night. I particularly do not enjoy parking in a poorly lit, unsecured parking lot and then walking to the hotel.   Nonetheless, the staff is friendly, and rooms are clean.

Love, love, love this place.  The menu is fantastic.  They actually have steel cut oatmeal!  Wildflower Bread Company is following the same line as Panera Bread, Paradise Bakery and Atlanta Bread Company, but better, exponentially better.  They have the best soups!  I love the Portabello Mushroom and Tomato Basil Soup.  The salads are fresh, crisp and have an abundance of veggies.  One big plus is the salads are not overpowered with dressing.  I will be back!

Lots of cool shops.  I am happy to find another location of Lucy, Ann Taylor and some great eateries.  Everything I need is right there.  I am coming prepared to do more shopping when I am in Mesa next month!

I have just arrived in town from Austin, TX and was starving. I spent about an hour searching for restaurants on my GPS, when I drove by this little gem. I decided to give them a shot and was completely amazed.   I ordered a Makers and Coke with a lemon and found out the bartender is a bourbon fan and made point to visit this place on my next trip to Mesa. I had the calamari which was stir fried without breading (scrumptious) and the Salmon Salad with asparagus. I love everything about this place, from the friendliness of the staff to the food and the live music.   Plus it is located directly across the street from the Mesa Arts Center where the Chorus Line is playing.

Items are a bit pricey, but seems well worth it based on the eclectic mix of color and quality.  I would rather purchase clothing than home decor.

I love this place!  This isn't your typical airport restaurant food, the food is fresh and delicious!  They have vegetables and amazing salads.  The food doesn't taste like it's been sitting around for awhile or some prepackaged mess.    Chelsea's Kitchen makes my visits to the Phoenix airport pleasurable.
