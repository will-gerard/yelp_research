Dear Karim,   I was sooo excited to find your place. My BFF's favorite dessert is cobbler and she loves the whole soul food vibe, so for her Christmas present it was decided i would treat her to lunch at your restaurant. We planned this before Christmas and your website stated that you were open 11am-2pm and that worked perfectly for us. So on Sunday Jan 3rd we arrived at your place at 1:15pm, appetite in tow, craving what you had to offer and you know what ? You were closed??? No freakin explanation.. nothing! Your sign even had the audacity to say open "11am - ??" Really? WTF kind of crap is that? If you're going to be so casual about your signage, why don't you update your website to mirror your lax hours of operation. You completely ruined the day and her Christmas present which we were both looking forward to. We ended up going to Hard Rock, satisfied yet still disappointed by the day's events.

After being let down by Karim and his cobbler deli..My friend and I walked to Hard Rock Cafe. Service was prompt and friendly..how could it not be.. there were only 4 tables occupied. The whole reason we ventured out was for cobbler (see review on Karim's Cobbler Shop & deli for debacle)and lo and behold Hard Rock was offering Apple Cobbler. The day was not wasted. I opted for the spicy chicken mac 'n cheese and I was not disappointed.. it had a kick to it. It is rare to experience true flavor at a chain so I was extremely pleased. They could have thrown in a bit more chicken but in their defense I did order the side not the meal. But the side was plenty filling. Onto dessert. oooh the fabulous cobbler crunchies....imagine me squeal with delight. Apple wouldnt  have been my first choice but it was damn good. Revenge is mine Karim! Thank you Hard Rock for saving the day.

Ive been here a hundred and one times and I still don't think ive ever had their pizza??? I ALWAYS get "The Lady is a Scampi", it's amazing and the shrimp are more than few and freakin' Chernobyl sized! Can't beat the pzookie either..Be warned though.. you will expand on site, thighs will fuse together etc... it's not healthy (not even the salads) is what im trying to say but oh so good.

Still awesome..for the very first time I tried their pizza. Had a friend in from out of town and we ordered the Chipotle Chicken Pizza. Holy Crap..awesome. Crust wasn't doughy like I love it (personal preference)but it wasn't  Lavosh like either so I was pleased. The pizza had the perfect chipotle kick..it won't disappoint the spicy lovers but won't intimidate the spice shy. One word of advice though..don't bother taking home the leftovers if you plan to eat next day. Lettuce does NOT save well and neither do avocados. Ended up throwing 1/2 the pizza away :(

This review is not for the food.. I LOVE the food..this review is for the service I received today and your ridiculous policy for takeout orders which doesnt accomodate the working class.  Today I called in at 11am to place a "togo" order and was informed that the next available "pick up" time was 12:45pm. WTF? Umm when did you start taking take out orders in increments? Whose brilliant idea was this? It seems that Oreganos must have had a meeting.. "How Can We Throw Money Out The Window".. I know! By not allowing people to call in and place take out orders to be picked up within 30-40 minutes! That person needs to be fired. seriously, you lost a $100 order this morning..who knows how many more you lost today or will continue to lose with this kind of  business practice. This would have been repeat business no less. I guess we'll take our repeat lunch business elsewhere and make sure we get the word out to all companies that enjoy ordering from Oregano's that you can't accommodate multiple togo orders at lunch time during the week M-F. You can't be oblivious to how many other restaurants can and will gladly accommodate? Can You? Good Luck to you.

Okay here it goes..while their food remains consistently delicious.. their service leaves a LOT to be desired. This issue is with the bartenders. A group of us showed  up for a birthday dinner. The regular wait was an hour.. for us (party of 11) was 1 1/2. My friend Carlos and I walked  up to the outside bar and no bartender to be found.. ok? No problem..inside we went. Okay so we approach the inside bar. We stand there and are unnoticed  by the 3 people behind the bar. Finally a woman greets us..imagine Janis Joplin and Joan Jett having a love child and now she's in her 40's..She takes my order a single Amstel Light...she takes Carlos' order.. 2 drinks. She cards us.. I show her my id and he shows his. She explains she needs to see and card the person he is buying the drink for. Okay that's a pain.. but fine. So what does she do. She leaves me at the bar while she goes with Carlos out to the crowded patio to card his wife.. really? How about you take care of me since I have met all the requirements? okay? so while she is gone..another bartender comes up and takes my order. As he is about to grab me a beer Janice Jett returns and says something to him he looks at me and I say the beer is for me Im on my own tab he turns back and he walks away?? WTF? What does it take to get a friggin' beer. So Janice Jett gives Carlos 2 drinks then I finally get mine and what does she do? She puts it all on Carlos' tab? Are you freakin kidding me? Janice Jett you are the WORST bartender ever. You did nothing right in this transaction. Needless to say we ended up with her as our server.. Murphy's Law..and she tried to card me again! I clued her in that she had done it just 20 minutes ago and her memory kicked in. Then we ask for more drinks. Half the table received theirs..and she made the rest of us wait as she doled out waters. Waters are great but we ordered beer..give us what we ordered! THEN give us waters..Ive never been so frustrated or irritated. It was almost laughable. Needless to say I didnt bother to order any more drinks after that.. what's the point..I wouldnt get it in a timely fashion anyway.

Okay Ive been to Qdoba, Chipotle and now here. Qdoba i wasn't impressed, Chipotle, you get your money's worth but Baja Fresh blows them out of the water! The first time I went (Monday) I had the Shrimp Diablo. First let me tell you, I like spicy.. like nose running, tongue swelling spicy, got me? im not saying it was that hot but it packed a kick that none of the other 3 came near and that's without drowning it in available hot sauces. Not only was the spice level sensational the shrimp are not little canned geisha shrimp, they are "multiple chews" large and they don't skimp on them either. Last but not least they pack that burrito with an equal amount of everything.. not 80% rice. This burrito is as heavy as a bar of gold and it's defintely worth it's weight.  P.S. I know my rule is go 3x before 5 stars but that doesn't apply to "fastish" food.

FYI this place is closed..it's now Bluewater Grille. But looks like the exact same place pretty much..add a couple booths and take out a wall. Decided to try the 5 entree choices for $5 deal that they had going. The Sourdough bread is AMAZING!!! My friend and I tried the Fish & Chips.. It was good no doubt, and many will enjoy. But it just wasn't unique enough or amazing for me. There are too many restaurants in Az that DO fit that bill.. to return to "decent". The fish is good, it's fresh but it's just that.

Okay so a sports bar is the LAST place I expect to find mouthwatering deliciousness. But this place is undeniably a must eat. Ive been here a few times and I have never been disappointed, but what prompts me to write about it is the Acapulco Shrimp Quesadillas. They are out of this world, the spicy jalapeno creme sauce is genius! My coworker ordered the pesto pasta and it smelled heavenly. The smell is that smell that even though you're stuffed beyond belief you still want to keep eating because it smells so good smell. Does that make sense.  Other than that its a great place to people watch..off track betting spot.. need I elaborate? You will NOT be disappointed by the food in fact it will trump any bad service experience you may have.

This place kicks ultimate butt when it comes to HH pricing! Martinis are about $6 which is decent but it's their version of bar food that is fantastic. I'm talking $1.95-$4.95 range for high end bar food. I had the Fried Chicken Biscuit sliders with Honey Jalapeno Mayo and it was freakin amazing & filling. I didn't need another thing to eat and it was only $1.95!! Im telling you the money you spend on food will free up the money for you to drink, and not have to drink on an empty stomach..and we all know that never ends well.

I love CPK and Im not afraid to admit it. Favorite dish is the chopped salad..its tossed in dressing when it gets to you..and the perfect amount as it should be! None of this dressing on the side crap which I hate. They never give you enough and its impossible to mix it evenly.UGH.. pet peeve. Anyway, back to CPK..great variety of pizzas if you're into foo foo pizzas like Ham & swiss, scampi, BLT, etc.. Ive never been disappointed.

We ordered in for work and it turned out great. The Gyros are not overloaded with Tzatziki sauce, just the right amount..but my favorite the Greek fries. Holy crap, they were nothing less than awesome. A Lemony kick with a smattering of feta...so good. we will definitely go back!

Okay I finally ate on site. Service was beyond fast..every table that sat near us including ourselves.. exclaimed "wow that was fast" when the food came. Im talking not even a 15 minute wait. I had the grilled chicken pita and it was delicious...pita was fluffy and doughy and chicken as grilled to perfection. Greek Fries are a must have.. you will eat them first before you even get to your pita they're that good. Its delicious, fast, inexpensive, you cant beat it.

Okay, so i had a friend in from CO and she wanted Southwestern cuisine so I suggested Sam's even though I hadn't been there in 10 years.  First they serve you with their version of chips and salsa and I don't think I will ever settle for regular chips and salsa ever again after this. There were 4 different chips..2 had various spices, one had the taste of powdered sugar and the last were sweet potato. Each combined with the salsa was a bite of culinary delight. I ordered the Ahi tuna sandwich and was satisfied with my selection. However my friend ordered the black and blue quesadilla and it was beyond fantastic! Defintiely recommend even if just for cocktails and their chips. Oh I almost forgot.. you get a stick of white chocolate wrapped in a husk with your check! So either way you WILL be having dessert. ;)

I flew in from a chilly gray day in San Antonio to a gorgeous day in Phoenix. Had lunch on the patio here.. just wanted something light and this was perfect. Assorted Bruschetta, caprese salad and chilled Riesling. Everything was perfect, the food, the service, the atmosphere, the weather. I can't believe I had lived here for 8 years and had never been!

OMG. If you're afraid of flavor stay away because this place has the market cornered. Papa Rellena ,one of my favorites. But my absolute top pick so far is the Gallina Frita. Its just perfect. But there is soo much to choose from. The Paella seems to be a huge hit on Friday nights when it's only $20. Oh and if you want a potent drink that will make you giggly but not sloppy. "Pussy's Painkiller" Yeah.. I know..its fun just to order it.

Okay so last night 6 of us came here for dinner. Its the 3rd time I have been to this location. The first time I thought it was AMAZING. Couldnt get enough of it. 2nd time was "ok", my drink (Pussy's Pain Killer) tasted off, not like the first visit and the food was somewhat bland. Chalked it off to being an off night. So last night I ordered a dish I had at the Bell Rd location which was phenomenal-Gallina Fritta. Last night it was almost dry, bland, you couldnt even taste the garlic or lime. So disappointing. My Pussy's Pain Killer tasted better but not even close to the "wow" factor the first time I had it. For this I dont think I will ever return, its far from consistent and has changed from "Amazing" to "meh" in 3 years time. Its time to find a new Cuban/Puerto Rican restaurant to get my fix.  As for the service..our server was extremely pleasant but scattered. He took appetizer orders from 4 of us and completely forgot to ask the other 2 at the table! Then the same 2.. their food entrees didnt even come out within 5 minutes of the rest of us.?? It is not a big restaurant and we were not a big party, so there was no reason for the service to be sub par.  In the poetic stylings of Guns -n-Roses." I used to love her...ooh yeah.. but I had to kill her"..is my final word on this place.

I have never actually sat down inside but Ive ordered out from here 2x. I think they're the best pizza in town..not for the crust..( I myself am a fan of doughy crust not deep dish but not thin either)...but for the sauce. It's fantastic. It has a hint of sweet to it which just makes it unique and delicious, I could drink it. Im not really a fan of the standard Heinz tomato sauce. THIS sauce has flavor and add garlic and spice, friggin perfect.

I can't get enough of this pizza. Tonight I took my friend there for her birthday..started with the house salad which was crisp and refreshing.. the ranch was ranch and didn't taste like seasoned mayo.awesome. I ordered the lil margherita and couldnt wait to taste that sweet goodness they have for a sauce and lo and behold the margherita is a white pizza???? You know what? It didnt matter it was magnificent without the signature sauce. This place is the best pizza place in Phoenix...hands down

Pure Fitness as a whole I like. No contracts, the people going there are actually there to work out and not to be seen, (ex. LA Fitness). Plus you get complimentary training sessions. However, this location I will NEVER return to and its all because of their new GM Adam. I had a free pass and he was the one that I had been assigned to for my fitness test and 1st training session. I had already explained that I planned to join but he wouldn't stop the full court press of selling which I didnt like at all. I wanted to use my weeks free pass THEN join. He wanted me to give him money right then and there when he hadnt so much as given me a tour yet! Anyway, I told him I wanted to wait and then he starts asking when I get paid, is it a money situation, etc..if made me VERY uncomfortable.   I went ahead with the training session and he knew in advance that Im not inactive but going to the gym is not something Ive done on a consistent basis in a very long time. Now I enjoyed the workout but from what others have told me..he pushed me way to hard for my first time out of the gate. My arms weren't sore, I know sore, Im okay with sore but they became weak for FIVE days, that I had trouble sleeping they had that irritable and restless feeling, and it hurt to use a freakin' date stamp at work!   But the reason Im not going back..I was surfing them online and saw how easy it was to sign up online so I did. That way I wouldnt have to worry about remembering voided checks etc.  Well I called Adam to let him know and he went off on me.. just short of yelling. "Great, now I lose the commission the gym loses the points.. you can understand why Im upset right." and he went on for about 5 minutes. I was stunned at how unprofessional he was and he's the GM??? If they work on commission they should give you a heads up "hey I know its easy to sign up online but we work on commission so I would appreciate it if you went through me if and when you choose to sign up". I would have respected that. OR if when you sign up online it allows you to put in the name of the person you have been working with so it doesn't circumvent them. But I was floored and pissed that he came at me like that.   Ps. Of all the Pure Fitness this one is the smallest, visually unappealing and has the worst customer service. I did sign up and I love the one I go to now...but this one I will never step foot in again

If I could give a nostar rating for my very first experience here I would. I decided to try them out since everyone gave them a great review and they are doing the 4 garments & 1 comforter for free deal. Well upon my arrival I mentioned  the "Yelp" deal and they said that only applied to the Tempe location?!! I wonder f you go to Tempe, they tell you it only applies to the Scottsdale location. Not impressed on first contact. I walked out.

I have always wanted to go here. It looks so fun from the outside. FINALLY the time has come. The staff was extremely friendly, food was above decent and decent portions. Only two complaints in that area....No splenda, only Sweet n Low  and I asked for spicy and it wasnt even close.   I would have given it 3 stars but I can't because of the following: The bathroom: It was funky but filthy. It's 1120am and the trash cans are overflowing, there are empty toilet paper rolls scattered about and it smells. It was like a dressed up gas station bathroom. The garbage can next to our table was full and was dirty. There are tons of  things hanging from the ceiling that will catch your eye. the one that caught my eye was the giant chinese food container near the entrance and not far above from where we were sitting.. while cute and fun it was also filthy. This place needs a power wash..

So I drove around a few weeks ago to find my new nail salon. I moved to this side of town in January and well now its flip flop season. I stopped at some place next to sushi brokers on Bell/Scottsdale Rd and it looked run down. I even went so far to sit in a spa chair and the chair massager didnt even work and the nail pictures were old and faded.I wasnt happy.. so I said I forgot I had something to do and left. Drove up to a place in the Harkins 101 and it was jam packed..they guy yells out 5 minutes even though its clear there is a 30 minute wait. Faked a phone call and left..well I didnt want to be rude?? Used my navigation system to check out this place right in the same plaza as my grocery store. OMG..it was heaven. The smell of the amazing candles they burn (and sell) is inviting. It has modern funky decor.. great music, its busy but not too busy..just right. I had a pedicure that was great. Hot bubbly water, fantastic leg massage. Also I had picked a color but the nail tech next to me had even better color on her toes. I asked her where that color was and she said she had just bought it for herself at Walgreens and offered to let me use it. Hands down my favorite nail salon. Friendly, customer service is fantastic, color selection extensive and it doesnt smell like a nail salon.. it smells like a spa!

Ive been here twice and my favorite item has been their version of tiramisu. It's not soaked in espresso or whatever the local italian eateries are using these days..it's made with champagne! It's light and fluffy..it's like eating a cloud from heaven. Very much a date place.. It has a "romantic" atmosphere so don't go there if you're not trying to give off that vibe. Otherwise great for a group setting..... Oh and for any potential cougars the waitstaff is delicious eye candy. ;)

Yummm. Love The Lady is A Scampi.. it's all I ever seem to order from this place. Can't get myself to stray. HUGE shrimp, pasta i perfect and full of flavor. As for everything else.. service was spot on, wait was only 30 minutes on a Friday night which is unheard of. One complaint.. ordered a dirty martini and there was no olive garnish :( But if that's the only problem..we're in pretty good shape.

Between TX and AZ I have lived at an Archstone for 5 going on 6 years. The management company is fantastic is what i want to say right off the bat. Transfers via Archstone are beyond compare.. 30 days notice NO TRANSFER fees or lease break fees and you can move to any Archstone as long as it's 30 miles + away. There are 4 Archstone's out here.   Gilbert - has the most gorgeous it's like a freakin resort..worth the money. I almost moved there but Gilbert is far from my work and my friends and unfortunately prettier isn't always better. The one in   Tempe is the least appealing.. in an industrial area, not to be confused with a hip warehouse district. No assigned spots, and it doesn't come with a microwave? This one is not worth the money compared to the others.  Glendale - Great area in Arrowhead, close to the 101, fairly quiet, maintenance is superb, fast, friendly and efficient.. My AC went out and b/c it couldn't be fixed they put me up in a hotel for 3 nights. You will be hard pressed to find a property management company that will do that. Great deal for the money.  Peoria - compared to Glendale their floorplans are better but there is a LOT of construction going on around the complex. A new complex just went up right next door and it's practically on top of them..so no longer a great location.  One thing you should know...Archstone is like an umbrella. The properties that are doing well financially support the ones that aren't doing so well. This is a GREAT thing. I worked for a property company where each complex, even though under the same management co. they each had their own investors and it was a nightmare. The properties that weren't doing well had their power shut off, vendors were suing  and/or threatening to file liens on the property to get paid, etc... This is one of the reasons I am afraid to leave Archstone.. If I do it will be for a Camden or an Equity for sure. But no matter what I will recommend Archstone until I am blue in the face.

Should I start by saying I despise going to the gym? Ontop of that I had a crap experience at the 32nd St/Greenway location (see that review).. But I must say I am very happy here. You get 2 Personal Fitness consults when you join and they put me with Alison. #1 Its a good idea to put someone with your frame but in better shape than you..its like working out with the future you. lol She was cute and bubbly and she pushed me, wrote down the number of every machine, the number my seat was, the weight, the reps and sets on my little blue card. The purpose of this is so when you come in on your own, you can grab your card and easily find the machines you need and the settings without having to spend a bunch of time trying to figure it out again. LA Fitness and Golds Gym will NEVER pay this much attention to you unless you are paying for the Personal Trainer pkg! Pure Fitness just seems more invested in their clients. They do try to encourage you to utilize their personal trainers by buying one on one time but it's not an overbearing hard sell. The prices are fantastic though. At least half of the other 2 gyms I mentioned. I hate gyms but I can't complain about this one, not at all.

Saw {Title of Show] last night..freakin hilarious. Its like Will and Grace meets the Seinfeld concept.. set to music? Hard to explain but it was great and I have raved about to my friends now Im raving to you. Its worth the trip downtown to check this out. Oh yeah I dont advise bringing kids.. this musical drops the "F" bomb quite a bit among other suggestive commentary. So I wouldn't say it's fun for the whole family if your family consists of anything younger than highschoolers. Otherwise. good times.

Im not a huge fan of Mexican because what so many consider "authentic" is bland and tastes like retirement food. When it comes to Mexican I prefer the frou frou such as Padre's or Barrio. So when the Urban Spoon app picked this place I was a bit reluctant but I go wherever the Urban Spoon App takes me. I had preconceived notions about what this place would be like. I figured order at the counter, they make it ,you sit down and eat it. I wasn't even close. It definitely would be what most consider "divey", dimly lit, tons of booths and dare I say "adorable" with full service inclusive of bar. Tvs in the corners with various sports going on, menus with pictures (awesome)..everything is numbered so you dont have to make an ass out of yourself trying to pronounce something you know damn well you have no idea how to.  Service was fast and with a smile, no complaints there. Now for the food. Im not a fan of the corn tortilla..possibly because Pink Taco was the only place I ever had one and it left me with the wrong impression. So I ordered their Taco Siberia (double wrapped in corn tortilla) and now I understand the fuss. It opened up a whole new world and I am no longer a corn tortilla hater! But what I really want to rave about is the side of potatoes and onions I had. OMFG. Freakin awesome. They were like perfectly seasoned non french fried french fries?Its the best way to explain.. trust me, order and you will understand. This place is true authentic flavorful Mexican food and the prices were ridiculously inexpensive. Such a find.

Hmmm. Macademia Nut Chicken I will push on people till i am hoarse. It's fantastic and if you like mashed potatoes with lumps.. you'll be extra happy..Its the perfect dish! Beware though it's heavy so i don't suggest it for lunch. Their HH is excellent.. LOVE their scampi pizza. Salmon Wasabi sashimi & jalapeno Yellowtail sashimi ain't too shabby either.

I don't get to go very often but their Happy hours are well worth it. The food is bursting with flavor and always great with presentation. You can't go wrong..Its not pretentious but I suggest you up your game a bit in clothing department...after all it's not Giligins. Great for a girls night out or a HH with coworkers.

Im not a huge wine drinker but I love the novelty of this place. #1 It doesnt have the most obvious entrance. #2 I call it the hobbit hole..because of the entrance and the dimly lit, underground-esque feel. It's very hipster yet swanky. Regrettably i have never eaten here.. per people's posts it seems to be items ffrom the Cowboy Ciao menu next door. I have had the "Kazimierz" shot though and I it's tasty. It's worth checking this place out, just to see it, and have the shot. You'll love it if you're a wino! ;p

After going to Toni & Guy (which is a crapshoot), Carsten (they make you stand to get your haircut..WTF?) and Atmosphere..I ended up at Vidal.. after all their motto is "If you don't look good,we don't look good" How could I go wrong right? Most expensive haircut Ive ever had ($77) but let me tell you Mark is worth it. I LOVE him. Such a great cut i don't have to go back for months! Only drawback is it's departmentalized..meaning one person does cut and someone else does color. I had my color done once and never again. I wanted to cover the ever emerging grays and she did for the day! The next day the color was gone???My dream would be find a salon with both an amazing stylist and colorist and have them be one person! But until then Im loyal to Mark.

Okay so I bitched that I wanted a salon that does both cut and color. I went to Root, ended up with damaged hair..(see separate review) and I went to Main Attraction and ended up with "Texas Hair" (see separate review). Well its about that time to go back to short and sassy and well trusting someone to do that is a much bigger trust than trusting someone to trim. So without a second thought I returned to Mark because there is just no one I trust more and no one I have found even close to comparable. I ended up not going as short as I had prepared myself to but nonetheless he turned me from blah to sassy with his magical skills. Mark rocks the scissors like no other. No one can compare, he is a true wizard. Trust me when I say there are a lot of salons out there that are overhyped for mediocre service. This salon is the perfect example of practice what you preach.. "If you don't look good, we don't look good".  P.S. The girl that colored my hair in my previous review.. is no longer at Vidal..

I was excited to check this place out. Having lived in AZ off and on for 8 years, the time had come. I had reserved in advance and our table was out on the patio, as the reservationist had recommended as the temp dropped to the 80's. For our table there was one umbrella and the sun, if directly on you was hot! We had to gather umbrellas and position them ourselves..it was quite a comotion. Our server even saw this and didnt even offer to assist!  The server, didnt seem to care about the service, after all the 18% was already included.  It took forever to get our drink orders and even longer if we wanted to partake in the bloody Mary Bar.. because he had to bring us glasses.  The Bloody Mary Bar, was on a teeny tiny filthy table next to the bar...the garnishes were extinct, the table was dripping various ingredients. It looked like the remnants of a rager the night before. One of my friends asked for an olive, since none were provided and the bartender (who wasn't busy) rolled her eyes and scoffed! WTF?  I have to say the food was good.. at least the lobster croissant was but it wasn't worth coming back with all things considered,

I hadn't been here in 2 years and they dont have them in San Antonio. Booo. I was craving their Garlic Fries.. what can i say? You know when you build something up in your head and it just let's you down? Well that just didn't happen! LOVE their garlic fries. Also tried their Cajun Fish tacos and they were overstuffed deliciousness. Not at all spicy so the "cajun" in the title isn't really necessary but tasty all the same.

I have both my cats on one of the Wellness Plans that Banfield offers. I pay $46/mo (both cats included) and it has been worth it. Shots, teeth cleaning, comprehensive exams..all covered. Ive checked into pet insurance and it was more expensive..Plus they're open on the weekends and it couldnt be more convenient. They have always been great with my cats so I have not a single complaint with this location and recommend them.

I know this is a burger place but they really should be praised for a freakin amazing grilled cheese! As far as their burgers go...I have created my own..burger with sliced tomato, cold mozz and vinaigraitte. I call it the Caprese burger and it's amazing if I do say so myself!

Went here last night as my final blow out before I jump on the Fat Smash train. Amazing burger, I couldn't have asked for a better send off. I had my creation I love so much..the Caprese Burger, see previous review. Friggin' delicious!

Four people within 2 weeks mentioned this place and one of them had seen it on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives..so Ive been dying to check it out. Today was the day. We arrive and it's in a little strip mall in an area that I have never had to drive through to go anywhere.Meaning  had it not been for word of mouth I would have never known this place existed! They ask if it's your first time and when you say yes they proceed to give you samples of their top dishes. I ordered a combo: Black beans, jerk fried rice, pollo diablo and emerald chicken. I can't even explain the flavor explosion that erupted. Emerald Chicken cannot be beat, it was dare I say orgasmic. In addition to the flavor fiesta you get a free freakin big ass doughy cookie!! A Snickerdoodle was this weeks cookie...not many even know what a Snickerdoodle is let alone make the best Snickerdoodle ever to be devoured. This place is beyond words! Just go..GO NOW!

Arrived here about 6pm tonight and it was already packed with 2 parties waiting ahead of us. Cute little historic home converted into a restaurant, tons of charm little space as is the norm in downtown suburbia. Main entrance..11 o'clock 3 two tops..bam right there not 5 ft from the door. 12 o'clock kitchen, 1 o'clock bar, 3 o'clock  two 2 tops lining the wall. We were offered one of the 11'oclock tables but there was no way. There is nothing I hate more than sitting on top of another table. They were so close even Nicole Ritchie couldnt squeeze between them. This space would be better served by 3 small high bar tables, allow for more traffic space and you're not forced to dine with strangers. Needless to say I would rather wait for a table that avoids the potential of being bumped and or drinks/food being spilled on me. We were seated in a side room and it was perfect, not too close to fellow diners yet still feeling a part of the energy. From the seating to departure was excellent. Service, was impeccable. Pizza's take a bit but they're made from scratch and worth waiting for. I ordered a white pizza (Salsiccia con Patate) and it was perfection.. My friend ordered a red pizza which I tried and you can taste the fresh tomatoes, no canned sauce here. Although extremely tasty Im still loyal to Spinatos on the red pizza. But white pizza they have my vote. Made sure I didnt gorge because I was dying to try their dessert. I am a HUGE fan of Nutella and they have 3 or 4 variations on Nutella crepes..I had the banana/nutella concoction with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and Im salivating being reminded of it. Nice call on the dessert Cibo, if not the white pizza I will return for the dessert. Either way I will be back.  P.S. We let at 8pm and there had to be at least an hour wait. If you have somehwere to be on Saturday night and this is your first stop. I suggest you get there upon opening at 5pm to avoid any interruption in your plans.

I don't know how many times I have driven past this place and never noticed it and that seems to be common place for this restaurant. It truly is a jewel staring you right in the face! Everyone I know LOVES Barrio..but the wait is pretty long on a regular basis. This place is just as good if not slightly better and NO wait. Last night I had the Lobster Thermidore Quesadiilas and they were fantastic! I would call the place cozy not cramped. Great date place. Truly a secret that is worth spreading.  P.S. 80s music was playing in the bar and you could hear it in the dining room but it wasn't overwhelming..just background..I noticed people were commenting on the music and their dislike of it. You dont go here to listen to the music..it's not a club after all or a live music venue. It's a bar/restaurant.. the music is inconsequential and should be viewed as the soundtrack to your life being played as you go about your business

Okay the first time I ever went i had a dinner entree and it wasn't that great. Second time I had the Bernaise sliders and I fell in love. Can't seem to order anything but them, since. However I did try the Ahi Steak sandwich once and that was amazing as well..Not a big beer drinker so really can't comment on that.. But the music ...if you like classic rock and/or 80's rock.. this is the place to be!!!There's just something about hearing Boston being played....

There is no restaurant better than Hash House! I went to the one in here and then to the one in San Diego. The food is consistently excellent. It never lacks for flavor, quality or presentation. So much to choose from that its easy to go back and try various items. I like to bring people who have never been just to see their expressions when the food comes out because their portions are ridiculous. Its almost as if it regenerates as you eat it!!!! Highly recommended. I wish they would multiply to out here in AZ!!!

Their Filet Mignon Cobb is my all time favorite there, its already perfectly tossed in dressing and is a meal.. not bird food by any means. I have also tried their mushroom/chicken crepes and Im not a crepes fan and I was more than impressed. Great place for a date or just meeting a friend out for a bite. Its swanky yet you won't feel uncomfortable dressed down. Not pretentious and the waitstaff is fantastic. My only complaint is on their mashed potatoes..too much oil and they're whipped to death.. but hey i like mine with lumps..so it's a preference thing.

Labor Day weekend we stayed here. Id never been but always wanted to try. 50's retro.. very cool bar & rooms and GREAT location to cab it to the local restaurants and bars.  HOWEVER... Labor Day weekend it was nothing but a Jersey Shore Casting Call. GTL dudes with tribal tattoos and stupid drunk "woohoo" girls.. you know what Im talking about. The pool was comparable to Hard Rock Rehab..just fog machines, base & chaos.   The walls although brick do not muffle the sound of drunk beligerent dumb asses breaking shit and having food fights in the hallways.  The experience was not worth the money that was spent.

ok.. so the owner persuaded me to come back and try again and I did. This time we had a different room which came with a bathtub placed in the middle of the room with curtains that could be drawn around it. Very cool. There seemed to be quite a few events going on (wedding, reception, etc) simultaneously but it was still relatively quiet. Nothing like the ridiculousness I had experienced Labor day weekend.  This time it was a completely different vibe..a good vibe. I would definitely stay again and recommend to others..I just recommend you call first to find out what's going on that weekend (ex..pool party)so you know what to expect.

This place is a lot bigger inside than you would think and it has 2 floors. We arrived at 445..HH is 4-6. Prices arent bad as far as HH goes but.. FYI kitchen doesn't open until 5. I started with the Almond Margarita which I though was unique. The first 2 sips you can definitely taste the almond..but after that it tastes like a tart lemonade..their drinks are NOT watered down. We tried the fingerling potatoes and it they were fantastic.. but its the lemon aioli that puts it over the top. The Goat cheese/bread also fantastic...I enjoy softer bread, but thats just personal preference. We also tried the ahi tuna sandwich and it was good but the apps blew it away. I will definitely return to try other things, especially a dessert!

So I LOVE my guy at Vidal but I HATE that it's departmentalized (cut & color is split btwn stylists), so I have been on a mission to find one stylist that does it all. So like everyone else I stumbled upon the reviews of The Root and went to get a consultation last month and Roxy was who I met with. It's a stressful decision  to A) cheat on your current stylist and B) trust a new one, but Roxy made me feel extremely comfortable with her skills and ideas that I was confident in booking an appointment. ...  Yesterday was the appointment.. I had my mind set on the cut and color I had wanted when I arrived but it all changed once i flipped through one of their hair magazines. I have dark hair and I was dead set on doing something funky in the "red" realm and she seemed confident I could pull it off, so we went with it. As for the cut, my hair was almost shoulder length and I was going to go back to almost pixie short but decided that was a change I couldn't handle all at once, so we took a lot off, back up to just above the chin. I drank two glasses of wine during the 4 hour process and was pleased when it was over but didnt really absorb or judge the change until this morning....  the verdict...I woke up and almost didn't recognize myself. The color change is so drastic (to me) It wasnt even close to the color I had picked out which was disappointing. I had wanted a deep chocolate with dark red highlights and this was dark chocolate with a LOT of caramel.   As for the cut, it's a great cut I cant complain. Maybe not quite as angled and edgy as Im accustomed but I came into work and received compliments left and right from people I dont even know, if that tells you anything.   Summary: If you're looking for a 20 something Emo razored rockstar look I would probably go elsewhere but if you're looking to rock a do that's sexy, feminine, classy and stylish you've found you're home.

Okay so it's been almost 4 months since I was here and I will never be back. Because Roxy felt the need to lift all the color out of my hair  in order to get the color I wanted.. which didnt happen. She overprocessed it. I have had nothing but breakage for 4 months and my hair feels like hay. NEVER has anyone had to lift my color to strawberry blonde in order to color my hair chocolate/deep red. For godsake my hair is already chocolate you are half way there???Plus as noted below...my hair didnt even become the color we discussed. not even close.  I have to say this has been the worst hair color experience I have ever had.  The one good thing Ill say about it.. their hair color lasts forever!!!!

Since my last review the owner contacted me. She was upset, not in an angry way, concerned and has offered a full refund. I must say this salon gets an A+ when it comes to making sure that the client is happy and/or rectifying the situation if you are not.  So for that  I will give them 4 stars because not a lot of people care as much as I believe this owner truly does.  One more thing. This was MY experience, it doesn't mean this will be anyone else's. I do not speak for the masses. I have no doubt that Roxy will be successful with or without my review. She has a great personality and I stand by the great cut I received.. I just had a bad experience with color and I could be a complete fluke, after all no one else has said a negative word in her direction.  So please Jennifer M..I dont know if you're Roxy's friend or an actual client  but there was no need to email me in Roxy's defense. This was just my experience, no one else's. Please respect that.

I had dinner  there last night.. I had never been. Service is great, atmosphere hip. Complimentary valet..(you can't park anywhere in the neighborhood). I ordered the Blood Orange Bellini and it was not your typical bellini..not frozen and frothy. It was champagne in a flute with a sugarcube dropped in. Still good, but not what one would expect..just an FYI. I had the Caprese salad and the Mozz was not served "classically". Cold and sliced in rounds or in balls. It looked like marshmallow fluff and was kind of tangy. I was almost sure I was eating something that may have gone bad. I do not recommend to any Caprese lovers. However, the Organic Chicken with pan seared gnocchi was fantastic. Granted i asked them to add some spice for fear it might be bland.. Spiced it was perfect and Im glad because it probably would have been a bit too bland for me. My dinner date had their signature Pappardelle and that was excellent as well, although a bit soupy which made it messy. Olive oil cake we had to try and I can assure you it does NOT taste like Olive Oil in case you are wondering. Its like a lemony bread pudding but not quite as moist as bread pudding. Delicious. All in all great neighborhood spot but not too much of a variety to eat there repeatedly if you like to try different things, which is my style. Too many restaurants in Phoenix to return only to eat the same item over and over.

I am really surprised that this place has received such awful reviews..maybe Im just getting the right things? ill be honest Ive never had an entree, only appetizers(ex. dbl stugged potato spring roll and philly cheesesteak roll) and dessert (ex.banana choc chip bread pudding) and nothing has ever been mediocre. Nothing but tasty morsels. I will tell you that I HATE their sister Cheesecake Factory, their food has no flavor (worst Sheppards Pie ever!) and it's consistently awful. I call it "retirement food"..That's why i was so surprised by Grand Lux. Until I have a bad meal by review stands..they've been consistently excellent at least 3 times, for me at least.

PF Changs has gone downhill. Pei Wei is great for "fastish" chinese but for real sit down dining. Eddie Chan's has all chinese food locations beat! Food is consistently phenomenal, portions are perfect, flavoring is far from too little or too much..just right. Unfortunately it's pretty far out there if you live anywhere other than N Scottsdale..but it's worth the trip for a taste. I live in Glendale and will drive for a craving.

First..they have Happy hour 7 days a week. WooHoo! 1st time was on a lazy weekend afternoon for Happy Hour.  The sushi rolls on the menu were decent but not all that elaborate, your basic rolls..so I think I would prefer the extended menu. However what I wish to absolutely rave about is the $2 Roka Burger offered at Happy Hour.  Best freakin burger,I can't even tell you.. but I will try and at a sushi place no less!! The meat tastes like it was soaked in a broth that is unbelievable, with a hint of wasabi. Topped with avocado..it's just amazing. I will be back for the burger alone and I want to try this Hamachi Chili Roll that everyone's talking about.  P.S. I won't give any restaurant 5 stars unless Ive been there at least 3 times and they remain consistent.. hence the 4 star.

I have nothing but good things to say about this place..so let me start with the only thing I don't care for..the fries..theyure the only thing that rates a "meh". They're skinny like McDonalds fries but not golden or crispy...does that help? Anyway other than that SCORE! The shake choices are extensive and freakin delicious. Yesterday i had the Blackberry Cobbler one and it was excellent. I managed to suck down the whole thing before my "My Bleu Chicken" showed up. There's nothing wrong with dessert first right? The chicken was sooo tender. That is the 3rd time Ive been and before I had a build your own burger and a build your own grilled cheese. You just can't go wrong here! There is something for everyone! Service is great and fast and food is delicious.. what more do you need?

Best cupcakes I have ever had hands down. They may not be the most moist but they are the best. The frosting & the filling blows everyone out of the water. Sprinkles are moist and they are chocolatey goodness but that's great if you ordered the chocolate cupcakes. If you order hazelnut, etc.. it should taste like something other than just chocolate, all their cupcakes taste the exact same no matter what you order and this is where Let Them Eat Cake succeeds. We ordered the "Strawberry Delight" for a coworkers birthday and OMFG they were amazing. Strawberry jam filled cupcakes with this amazing light and tasty strawberry frosting. Not only do they taste fantastic but they look fantastic. I am devoted to you Let Them Eat Cake!!

So I was really excited to check out this place when I visited Phoenix at the end of July. Went straight there from the airport.. Love the swanky hole in the wall that Phoenix seems to have a niche in. Our server was very nice and the drinks were great...but now the disappointment begins...Appleton Rum Sea Scallops app was pretty good, couls have used more flavor but what's awful was there were only 2 and our food took forever!. Not worth it.They should definitely change this into a main dish add scallops, more seasoning & rice, and increase the price to make it worth it. I ordered the pork with polenta and it was boring! My friend ordered something else.. dont remember what but she wasn't thrilled either. So I recommend this place maybe for a Happy Hour but for dinner's there is better out there. If you're looking for Carribean food downtown.. I suggest Ticoz.

This is only my second time here in 2 years and then it was funky yet chaotic because it was so new. This time was very laid back, great music great Happy Hour prices, food was excellent and had a great variety of appetizers to choose from. My date ordered me the pikachu..tasty..not too sweet..just right..Goldilocks would be pleased. Bartenders were friendly but not stalker like. All in all a fantastic experience..highly recommended especially for Happy Hour. Oh and how can I forget...their toilets are interactive..you'll know what I mean. ;p

OMG! I finally checked this place out a few months back and can't stop talking about it! It's like a freakin Goya warehouse!  Asian, Indian, Jamaican food..The only place I can find pre made Jamaican beef patties. There are tons and tons of  refrigerators filled with an unlimited supply of various potstickers. It doesn't get any better than that! Also all sorts of fun cookies and wafers from the orient. This place is freakin awesome AND it's not expensive in the least bit to boot!

This review is long overdue.. for me anyway. Came here Labor Day weekend, we were itching for some sushi and stumbled across this via the Yelp App. We were NOT disappointed. Sushi rolls were unique and delicious.. we had ; Red Zeppelin (good but not my fave), The Deep V (fantastic) and Peanut Butter and Jellyfish. The PB & J was ridiculously good and could easily be considered dessert sushi. The place was hip and fun and great to people watch. Lot's of 20 somethings wearing nothing but black attire, its like  watching a casting call for Jersey Shore. LOL  But it was fun, not overpriced, good portions and unique rolls. Definitely will return to try some of the other rolls!

I have moved A LOT..and it's pretty hard to find a moving company that you will use a 2nd time. Some I swear could double as a methadone clinic. I had one team of movers show up.. teeth missing, etc.. Not that they werent nice people but they were sketchy and a bit careless with my stuff  but they did bring me my stuff so I guess it could have been worse. However..Camelback Moving was AMAZING. I have confidence that none of their employees will end up on the show Intervention.   They were a little late but they called early to tell me which makes all the difference when you're tyring to plan your day. They arrived 1/2 an hour after my window which wasnt bad at all.  2 young guys showed up.. clean polite and freakin fast! I I was moved within 2.15 hours.. a 1 bedroom from Glendale to Scottsdale. Nothing was scuffed or broken and there were no surprises. I wouldn't even bat an eye if I was asked if I would use them again. There is no question that I would and I would recommend them to anyone and everyone. Prices are reasonable and you can move without worrying something will go awry!

Well I had to take away a star..From the attachment from my receipt I was under the impression that I would receive a $50 referral fee for my referrals. When my friend booked with them  (and they didn't ask who referred her) I called them. It turns out they only give out referral fees for state to state moves. Well that sucks.. I know A LOT more people that move within the state than move out of state. Too bad if there was a $50 referral fee I would go out of my way to recommend. Now Im left kind of disappointed.. I had another referral for them,.. but now i just dont feel like making the effort.

Okay where to begin? Urban Spoon App pick. Clean, plenty of places to sit, indoors and outdoors. Already its blowing any Sub/Grinder shop Ive been to out of the water. All the sandwiches I saw being made looked ridiculously good! I had the Big Kahuna which is their Philly Cheesesteak with mushrooms and jalapenos added. Now I dont understand the people complaining about not getting your money's worth? Are you kidding me?? This isnt Taco Bell?? Its a friggin sub shop. $14 for 2  well endowed subs is expensive? If this is too rich for your blood. try the dollar menu at Jack in The Box. Or are you one of those that prefer the entire animal in your sandwich (ex. Miracle Mile/Jason's Deli) Ridiculous! Their "regular" size is approx an 8 inch sub and they're far from stingy. One average sized person will be more than satisfied with a "regular" sandwich???. Seriously to have to order a Large or have chips on top of your regular is just unnecessary spending and overkill on the food front. It's like people are brainwashed into thinking you have to have a side with everything you eat.. Im not cheap Im just not overeating...If you can eat a regular + add ons....you're either planning for leftovers, an athlete, a grown man, trying to gain weight,  or are friggin stoned !  As for other comments about it being soggy. Yes it was a bit but not falling apart or seemingly dipped in au jus soggy. My "grinder" was fan freakin tastic! It reminded me of D'Angelos #7 for all you East Coasters that may be familiar with that chain. LOVED it!

We took a trip on our lunch hour to grab some grub for work. I had the burrito special "Chicken Piccata". umm as long as I have lived, chicken piccata consists of: chicken breast cutlets, dredged in flour, browned, served with sauce of butter, lemon juice, capers, and stock or wine. Right? This was none of those things.. it was more like a chicken fajita burrito and bland at that. It was decent and hefty but Im sorry Baja Fresh blows this place out of the water.

Sooo disappointed. Arrived here yesterday with a friend at about 4:15pm. Seated promptly. An over bubbly petite girl approached our table.. (you know the kind.. TGI Fridays "flare" type) speaking in cheerleading tones, we'll call her "bubbles" letting us know our server would be with us in a minute.. right as our server arrived.  There were maybe 5 tables sat including ours in all areas of the restaurant and Ill be damned if our poor server wasnt waiting on every single one of them.. which explains why she wasnt very attentive. Not really her fault..Our food did arrive in a timely fashion delivered by "Bubbles". My friend had ordered the squash casserole and had asked if bread was available for her to order and the attitude and outright snottiness of bubbles next comment decided the gratuity and the fact we will never go back. She said " we dont have bread.. this isnt the Outback." You should have seen the looks on our faces.  She then catches herself and says we have pita and my friend staes "nevermind, that's not what I was looking for". Bubbles goes away and comes back with an order of pita anyway. We sat in silence for a good 5 minutes.. apalled at that little bitch's outburst. As a manager I would have fired her on the spot for speaking to a patron in that manner.   After the "incident" and our meal was finished, the plates were cleared and we sat...and sat while our server tended to the rest of her tables. Meanwhile there are 5 servers doing sidework right in front of us.. including Bubbles (who mind you was leaning over the sidework table laughing and not helping her coworkers at all). We made eye contact with several of them hoping they would notice we were looking for our server and nothing. We had actually wanted dessert but by the time our server finally showed we just wanted to leave. Im sure our server would have been great had she had any form of assistance from her coworkers. But the snottiness of the self righteous self entitled Bubbles was inexcusable.  Im sure you're wondering about the food.. it's decent but not anything amazing..too many restaurants in Phoenix to come back here for their food, let alone to be talked down to by the staff.  Oh and also, we were told their tomatoes are flown in from tuscany.. Seriously? In this economy you're flying tomatoes in from Italy and not supporting your local markets..FAIL

BEST Creme Brulee in the world.. well at least so far..that I have tried. It had banana and the bottom was lined with chocolate. Pure unadulterated heaven!  Came here via the Urban Spoon App..otherwise I would have probably never stumbled upon this gem. Shrimp cocktail fresh and excellent. Mahi mahi tacos, tasty! Service quick, friendly, efficient. Tiny little place..size of a large living room..walls cluttered with badly framed movie memorabilia and such. 2 Large screen TVs, nice lighting. Its like someone turned the man cave into a dining room. lol.  I will most certainly be back.. if just to force the creme brulee on all that I know.

Such a Disappointment! I love Fox Restaurants so I was uber excited to finally check this place out. We started with the Guacamole. It looked amazing but was bland and flavorless. I ordered the ahi tacos and they were "meh". Now my guy and I LOVE desserts but were so disappointed with what we had.. why bother hitting a disappointing trifecta? Great decor, great service, boring flavorless food.

I love this place..something for everyone. For Garlic Lovers - the garlic dip will NOT disappoint. You will ward off all vamps guaranteed. Philly cheesesteak/chicken lovers...unforgettable. Lemon chicken salad amazing (HUGE grilled  chicken strips), tuna pizza..odd maybe..but delicious all the same. Need I go on? .the only thing i didn't care for was the veggie burger oddly enough. For an exceptional veggie burger I would steer you towards Four Peaks Brewery. But other than that they are spot on everytime all the time. Can't go wrong!

Okay Akai Hana or Mr. Sushi? Who gives a crap what the name is, it's not going to stop me from tyring a place because of the name. First thing you should know they have HH EVERYDAY from 4-6pm...om the weekends 3-6. My friend and I checked it out a few months back on a Saturday to see what this place was all about. It was day time, in a strip mall..large windows so I don't know how it could possibly be considered dark if you went in the daytime. Its not a fancy place, it's not a RA or Kyoto..so if you want atmosphere and pretentiousness, yes by all means stay away. For the sushi however...they have the most unique rolls I have encountered thus far in AZ.   ex:  MEXICAN -   Tuna, cucumber and habanero,topped with masago  AUSTRALIAN OUTBACK- Mackerel, tuna,tasmanian abalone, avocado with mango sauce  BUTTER ME UP  -Tuna tempura, avocado,seared salmon, topped with garlic wasabi butter  TODD (Volcano) 15.00  Baked spicy tuna, cucumber,avocado, with shredded crabstick, sits on top of orange,with special sauce and lit on fire   I kid you not.. they have some crazy rolls and we ordered 4.. which included the Butter Me Up listed above. The presentation was phenomenal and so was the food.  We did not experience screaming kids or squeaking fans?? Anyway I was so excited by this find that I sent my boss there and he LOVES sushi. It was him, his wife and their 3 kids (who are very well behaved i might ad). They went for the HH and they loved it. They walked out of there spending less than $50 for the 5 of them..That's numerous appetizers and rolls.  Seriously you can't beat this place for unique rolls and prices. Who cares where it is or what it's name is. This place was freakin fantastic .

Best Italian food I have experienced in Arizona and I was surprised because it's a chain. My guy and I were ooing and ahhing throughout the meal. I had the Lobster and Shrimp Ravioli with Crab insalata and it was a perfect portion, perfect flavoring and al dente! AMAZING. The only thing this place needs is Spumoni (minus the candied fruit)!!! Our server didn't even know what it was! What? i know!

If you're not willing or unable to spend high end money ($60 - 70) for solely a cut but demand a high end result.. THIS is your safe haven. I had my hair cut AND colored for less than $100. That's unheard of, well at least from the salons that I have confidence in. The color is fantastic and the cut is the exact cut that I had had at Vidal, well close.. I had them tweek it a bit. All in all worth the drive my friends, worth the drive!

Hell Yes. There is nothing i dont like about this place. It's relaxing yet hip, nice booths, great outdoor space. It's nice and spread out so you're not forced to dine on top of others. The waiter was great, attentive yet not pushy. I had their version of the Caprese Salad with Roasted Chicken added and it was a burst of deliciousness. My friend had the pepperoni pizza and that was crispy yet doughy perfection. Portions were perfect. Dessert I tried the pistachio crusted cheesecake and it was smooth, not too rich..dare I say refreshing and light? Ive never really had a "stomping ground" but this could be it!!

Okay so Ive been here 4 times now this month alone which is unheard of for those that know me. I never go to the same place repeatedly, let alone in the same month. 3 of those times I was lucky enough to be waited on by a delicious waiter named Andrew. He's attentive, knowledgeable, humorous and definitely nice to look at. The perfect server..not one complaint.  Last night was the real test. My birthday dinner, eleven of us, they do not take reservations, so this could have been a disaster. We put in our name at 7pm, and were told a 30 minute wait, we had prepared for at least an hour. Saddled up to the bar at the perfect time..as we approached, others were leaving so we had tons of room and didnt have to wait for drinks. Hostess even gave bartenders heads up to start closing us out because our table was coming up..definitely well organized.  We were sat well within an hour. What I like about this place is that it is sooo spacious. Every table is sat but it never feels crowded. We ordered appetizers, of which I sampled the salami and homemade mozz with Rosemary Flatbread. Their flatbread is unspeakably good. For the my entree I went for the Spring Pea Risotto with crispy prosciutto (added roasted chicken) and although it looked a bit excorcist-ish, it was excellent. I don't know that I would order it again, but I wasn't unhappy with my selection by any means.  For dessert as the birthday girl, I was offered the chocolate cake with cherries and whipped cream or the gelato. I went with the cake, and I'm not a big chocolate fan...but this was fantastic.. it wasn't too rich, the cherries and whipped cream were a delicious addition. It couldn't have been more perfect.  Thank you Parlor.. you made my birthday dinner a flawless event to remember!

First time I ordered out from here for work.  Drawback.. the salads aren't pre tossed in the dressing. Obviously to keep from being soggy upon pick up but the dressing they supply is more than what they would toss with if you ate on site. Unfortunately I trusted the portions they gave me would recreate the "on site" salad and I ended up drowning my poor salad into a soggy mess. Also I had to tell the boy packing the order not to put the burgers in with the salads. Hello? Isn't that "Working in a restaurant 101"  n'est ce pas?

First time here last Sun (02-28)..discovered it via Urban Spoon App. My friend and I arrived for lunch. It reminds me of a cigar bar w/o the cigar smell as far as decor goes. Hip & swanky, with a heavy emphasis on glass with large leather half moon shaped booths lining the walls.. Dark but not too dark. Service was great no complaints.. Now for the food.  Ok so we ordered burgers (what their draw is) and half & half fries (sweet potato & regular). The fries were excellent, sea salt on the sweet potatoes and thyme on the regular. Delicious..My one complaint is they came out 15 minutes before the burger?? In fact I wasnt even hungry by the time the burger arrived.. but I managed. I ordered a Turkey Burger with jalapeno bacon, onions, tomatoes, american cheese and Lemon dill sauce. The burger was friggin huge and needless to say I only managed to devour half of the thing before tapping out. It was a great burger and this place has an unbelievable selection to build your own. The only thing I dont care for is their description of cheeses.. it made them sound unappetizing. Plus even with the descriptions it doesnt give you an inkling as to what it tastes like. My suggestion.. let the patron ask and maybe offer samples if the patron seems reluctant.. Plus if you put the knowledge on the servers and having them be able to describe the cheeses in laymen terms it would really be quite impressive. If they do know their cheeses already then you should really have them offer to explain the cheeses..otherwise i guarantee you will receive a majority of American & Cheddar orders since the others are so non mainstream..ex..Midnight Moon, Red Hawke, St. George, Burrata, etc..  Overrall I would return with or without the superior cheese selection. The burger was damn good and if you add sauce, you're not going to taste the cheese anyway.

Okay so I went back today and wasnt in the mood for a heavy burger but they offer this yellowfin tuna burger with spicy aioli and crispy onion strings which sounded yummy. So I ordered it and it was fantastic. Filling but not heavy and packed with flavor. I dont know that I would order anything else, it was that good. Im dying to try their breakfast but alas this is the last weekend for that until summer is over.

Came here for a final "farewell to Phoenix" lunch with 10 of us. It was hot outside and the wait was an excruciating hour. What was nice was they had coolers of drink for the people waiting. Once we were finally sat, the service was fast and friendly. I ordered Kool Aid since well.. everyone else did. When I received it I remember why I dont drink it...its too damn sweet! Ick.Anyway I ordered the Tre Tre and i was freakin delicious and the perfect amount of food. I could not have been happier to have this as my final meal in Phoenix. I definitely recommend this place, just be prepared to wait.

I have tried everything.. Gyms.. always found an excuse to not go, I would get bored. Running.not a fan. DVDs after 3 weeks I would imagine I was too busy. Then I stumbled upon this gem. I got in on a great deal for 4 weeks. The deal lets just say was to good to not pass up that if I didnt use it, no regrets. But I went all 4 weeks, never missed a day. I lost 8 lbs in the first 2 weeks and I am sooo much stronger. I enjoy it because Im held accountable. Trust me you will get called out by your peers if you are not pulling your weight, so to speak. Its so fun and so worth the effort and I feel fantastic after its over. I loved it so much I signed up for another 12 weeks! My trainer is Lisa at the Thompson Peak/Bell location and shes funny and tough.  She doesnt yell at you and lets everyone go at their own pace unlike some of the other military style trainers but dont be fooled her class is not for the lazy. Your ass will be kicked... the results are there for the taking but you're not going to get them if you dont push yourself. LOVE LOVE LOVE BOOTCAMP!

Formerly The Fish Market..looks like the exact same place pretty much..add a few booths and take out a wall. Decided to try the 5 entree choices for $5 deal that they had going. The Sourdough bread is AMAZING!!! My friend and I tried the Fish & Chips.. It was good no doubt, and many will enjoy. But it just wasn't unique enough or amazing for me. There are too many restaurants in Az that DO fit that bill.. to return to "decent". The fish is good, it's fresh but it's just that, nothing to rave about.

I lived right next to Sears Auto in Glendale and found that not only was their service good but their prices beat everyone out. So since I just moved to Scottsdale and  my AC is on the verge of going out and I decided to check Yelp for finding a new "go to" for my Automotive needs. The one I decided on was Kelly Clark Automotive. I told them my AC situation and they said it would be a min of $60 just to check it out. Well called Sears (at the location Im reviewing) and they said it would be free to "eyeball it". I drove in this morning and they did a full diagnostic, discovered 2 O rings were leaking and it needed a charge. The discovery was FREE as promised. I dont know about you but that beats paying  a minimum of $60 any day!! I remain loyal to Sears Auto!

I didnt know what to expect since this place replaced Pink Taco. Pink Taco looked like a cross between the set of Nacho Libre and an Elks Lodge. Well CD kept the Elks Lodge part and married it with Z Gallerie and I like it.  The waitstaff kind look out of place though..they look like they work at a country bar? Their gear doesnt really match the decor.   Besides that.. service was great and the food.. OMG. Ill be honest there wasn't a whole lot that really called out to me.. but what I ordered.. who cares what else was on the menu? Started with the pretzel fondue. Doughy deliciousness dipped in cheese and good cheese.. NOT nacho cheese. My guy is STILL raving about it 2 months later! Then I went for the Sweet Corn Canelloni and it was good. Im talking "Last Meal" good!  This place is worth checking out, without question!

Anytime Im near a Hash House its a must that I visit. I especially love to bring friends that have never been, just to see the looks on their faces when their food comes out. This time I managed to eat their 2x and tried something new each time. The salmon scramble was decent, however, the salmon was somewhat "fishy" and more like dry tuna than a moist salmon. So this particular meal I was disappointed in my choice. Upon my return for Easter Brunch I had the BEST Bloody Mary I have ever had and I tried their Meatloaf Sandwich (The Kokomo). The meatloaf was amazing! Best thing Ive had yet though is the Sage Chicken Hash.but Im going to keep trying something new everytime I can go! Love this place!!!

OK, so this place is perfect for kids birthday parties or someone that's never been on a horse. Ill give them that. But for anyone that has ridden this was the most uneventful and boring trail ride to go on. There were so many people on our ride (approx 20)..all we did was walk.. no trotting, nothing, Just 2 hours of slow pace walking, even the horse I was on seemed bored out of his mind.

I have been dying to go here since I saw it on the Food Network's "The Best Thing I Ever Ate". So this place was my Birthday Request. I ordered the Hazelnut Milkshake which was perfectly cold and surprisingly light and frothy, not heavy. My choice for the Main Course was the Spicy Chicken Pizza, although very good.eh..I could have picked something better like the Macaroni and Cheese. The waiter had actually suggested it..not realizing it wasn't on the Brunch menu. (Note: If its not on the menu request it!) This was the best mac and cheese in the world I am certain! "Really Cheesy - Really Crunchy Mac n Cheese - marinara, fresh tomatoes & bacon". You know in the movie in Seven..the gluttony crime scene, where the guy ate himself to death? That could easily occur with this dish. Its like crack..no joke.

Okay...so I lived in Austin from 2000-2007 and had unlimited access to Rudy's. Loved their brisket and sauce, gas station set up and the fact they market themselves as the "worst BBQ". I moved to Phx for 4 years then back to Texas in 2010. San Antonio this time and yes we have Rudy's but they're not nearly as accessible as they are in ATX. So I think Ive been once in 2 years. Went for a wkd trip to Phx at the end of July and low and behold what do e drive by in Chandler? A Rudy's! My friend had never been so I insisted we go there for breakfast. Unfortunately my friend wasn't a fan of the sauce.. too peppery for her liking. I loved every second..not so much the brisket/egg taco but the potato egg & cheese with the sauce. OMFG! Delish! Well now Im moving back to CT so Im sure Rudy's is in my pat but Im glad I got one last taste. Ill miss you.
