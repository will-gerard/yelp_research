ABC is the Home Depot for the baker or kitchen gadget junkie. They offer unique cake molds, cake toppers and my favorite- solid color cupcake liners.   They host a number of different Wilton cake decorating classes.  They close by 3:00PM.

What I like about the downstairs bar is that you get very limited cell phone service. So if you're with someone who happens to be additcted to their crackberry- then this is your place. The food is rich and awesome- I especially like their seafood selections.

Not only is it Happy Hour, but they have the REVERSE Happy Hour too. The menu changes about once every quarter, but you can always count on the hamburger and fries being there and they mix in some tasty treats too like Ahi tuna nachos and shrimp cocktail.

There was time in my life that I was at Keegan's at least once or twice a week (don't judge me!) and here's the scoop on what you should order:  Sliders and a Stella. They have prime rib sliders, with a zesty horse radish Dijon mix that's outstanding.  Look at the menu board, but Thursday nights should be Yankee Pot Roast night.   Potato Skins. Big plate and good enough to share.

Everybody needs a local watering hole and the Famous Wing provides the perfect- no fuss environment. It's under new ownership as of April 2007, so some of the greasy spoon legacy should be working itself out. But if you want a nice cold beer, good friendly conversation and WIRELESS INTERNET ACCESS AT A BAR- then you should go.

Kemta and Al were my sushi chefs last night at Shimogamo and they were very friendly and hospitable. I finished work last night around 8:30PM and was hungry for sushi. They close at 9PM Mon-Thurs.  They welcomed me in, let me know it was no problem to serve me and were so great about it. What great attitudes they have.

Ambiance: The restaurant is very pretty and when you walk up there is a huge fountain out front. Typical AZ, a nice restaurant in the middle of a shopping strip. I was turned off that the bar wasn't really separated from the dining area and I could see and hear the bar TV from my table.  The booze: We ordered a Kir Royale to start dinner and it was tasty. I was disappointed in the wine list that was separated by Italian and American choices. I didn't recognize any of the Italian and all the American wine choices were options you could buy at Basha's or Safeway. The options didn't offer anything really wow and special unless you jumped to the $100/bottle options.  The menu: There were a lot of options, but I was disappointed to still see so many Winter options and it didn't seem that there were a lot of Spring updates other than an Spring value menu inserted into the main menu.  What we ordered: We ordered the crab cakes, they were good, but not amazing. We then had the Lobster bisque, it was delicious. He ordered the veal ravioli and cleaned his plate! I thought he was going to slop his bread in the sauce. I ordered the seafood risotto. My seafood was chewey and the one lonely prawn on the plate was so over cooked that it looked like a knuckle. Most of my shell fish didn't have meat in the middle and there was so much calimari that the dish should have been called calimari with risotto. The dessert we ordered was a ricotta cheesecake, the menu read with cherries. I was excited because cherries are coming into season and I thought it would be fabulous. What was delivered to our table was a chocolate strawberry cheesecake. Which was disappointing in taste and simply disappointing because it's not was we ordered. The waiter to make up for it compted our coffee :/  I've experienced better for $150. Off hand, I'd recommend Cork in South Chandler instead.

They have a real grill. With FIRE! Take cash, because that's all they accept. I did it up right with a dog basket and vanilla milk shake.  The line seemed long, but they've got such a system that it moved really quick.

I ordered a hot dog. Surprise. It's hard to review a hot dog. Let's see there was a bun. It wasn't soggy. There was a frank and chili on top. It was ok. I ate it. In a pinch, I'd go back.

They're smart about their wine list and serve a good cocktail. I think that's a great place to start. I've been here several times and the last time was when they offered a preselected menu with Justin wine pairings.  They created a great atmosphere and were really informative about how they prepared the dishes and why they choose the wine pairings.   Go there for dinner or to hang at the bar.

The name does suggest some competition and what's funny is that you can't have better than sex cake without having the thoughtful discussion around is it or isn't it.   I'd dare say there's more sex being discussed at the little cafe tables than on an Oprah show.  My thoughts, it is good cake...

It's not just a bakery. You can get freshly made tortillas and the best breakfast burritos in town. They're open Tues-Sat early. Lot's of Gilbert police officers eat here, so you know it's good food for a good value.  My favorite is the potato egg and cheese burrito.   Whatever group owns El Zocalo in downtown Chandler also, owns El Sol.

Tiramisu so thick and creamy you'll think you've died and gone to heaven. That's usually the sign of a good Italian restaurant and I'm glad this place is in downtown Chandler.  This place is still a little sleepy on week nights, but is really busy on Friday and Saturday nights.

Whoo hoo. I guess you can guess how I spent my Saturday. In Chandler you don't really have an option of taking DD online. You have to actually appear before the judge and plea your case.  As far as DD goes, this one wasn't that bad, for what it was. Lt. Mike Burns was my instructor and he was very interesting and ran a tight ship.  My class was in the community room at Chandler Fashion Center. The class started at 7:45 and the air didn't kick in until 8:30 and one wall was on the other side of Paradise Bakery. And the music in their kitchen was really loud and someone in there was just singin their heart off. It was distracting and funny at the same time.

For a buck every Saturday from 11am-3pm you can make your own from scratch card. Nicki (I think she's the owner) creates a new card every Saturday, she sets out the supplies and coaches you while you make your own.  Nicki was really friendly and helpful.

Bugger Bagels. That's gross right? But that's what I call this Bruegger's on AZ Ave. This is going to sound super mean, but everything about this place is gross- like gag me with a spoon gross. The kitchen isn't clean, the tables are never bussed and the bagels are always a little crunchy and I can't tell you how many times I've seen the staff here handle food without gloves.  Exhale. Ok, I feel better.

Grumble. I would hate to be measured by my worst day at work, but come on "B-Dubs" I had a horrible lunch, errrr, almost lunch. I arrived at 11:45AM, before the rush, placed a simple order, only to have you forget it and not even realize it. I walked out after 35 minutes waiting for a chicken sandwich. Give me a break.  The only reason I would come back is that I've had good Happy Hour experiences with y'all. $2.00 drafts.

Monkey pancakes- not since cup cake came together has there been a more flavorful union! OJ is fresh, the baristas actually know what they're doing and the serving sizes are HUGE.  You might be put out that the tables aren't as orange as the name suggests, but it's easy to get over it.   Get there early to avoid a wait, it you hit this place at brunch time on a weekend, you'll wait a bit.

Is your name Onita?  No?  Do you like wicker chairs? No?  Do you like fake ivy? No?  Then you really shouldn't go to the Quilted Bear. It smells like old people. Honestly, I can't even remember what I got. Maybe a chicken salad sandwich.  I was so overwhelmed by the 70+ average age, the wicker chairs and fake dusty ivy everywhere that I couldn't hardly stand it.

I punished myself by getting dessert! The fact that I licked my plate clean, drank gallons upon gallons of iced tea wasn't enough. NO! I had to, had to get the peach cobbler and peach cobbler can not, can not be served without ice cream.  What makes Monti's different for y'all looking for something more 'local' is that it really is a place with history and it's written all over the walls.  Eat here, walk it off with a stroll down Mill and don't forget the peach cobbler!

Tequila and guacamole. Start off with a good tequila and be prepared to wait. On a weekend night you'll find yourself waiting for a while, but the food is worth the 45 minutes.  Guacamole is an event and they make it right at your table with pomegranates. It's delicious.

A patio that doesn't just make you look at cars! That's the first thing you'll notice when you get here. On a weekend you can wait about 45 minutes, but just get a designer margarita and enjoy the view and the action. FYI, it's a lot of food. I usually just order an appetizer as my main course.

I think the Gelato here is delicious and they've got a huge selection. My favorite combination is peanut butter and stracciatella. It gets a little traffic heavy around 8:00PM with teenagers finishing up dates, but get there just before or a little after and it should be easy to find a seat and visit comfortably with your friends.

Nutella, bananas, chocolate- I know I shouldn't start with dessert, but their crepes are so good I can't resist. Everything here is good, the patio is great, the owners are on site and very friendly.

Reviews in America West Magazine are always a shot in the dark- and this one I hate to say was a miss for me. There are a lot of cool, swanky, throw back elements. The place looks cool. BUT, some things have got to go:  1. The little ottomans in the living room. They're squishy. Problem if your date is about 250 lb. He took one look at how much it squished when my 120 lb sat on it, smiled and said "You've got to be kidding!"  2. Cold food. The meatballs are supposed to be fabulous and I'm sure they are when they're hot. I could have gotten past it if they were just warm, but they were really cold.  3. Wine knowledge. This hurts to say because they are a wine bar, so I'm sure it's important to them that they get good reviews here. BUT, when I asked about the characteristics of some different chardonnays on the list, I didn't get a lot of details. Just their year and where they were from.  Sorry Lisa G. I really want to like this place, but for now, my opinion is that this little cute place still needs some work.

Driving by, there's something about Zest. It's not in the best part of town, the building isn't that pretty.  I remember when I first moved to Phoenix driving by and thinking it was a center for gospel singing. Then hearing a friend mention it as a place he and his wife were going for their anniversary. My suggestion, if you're not a fruity martini drinker, make an exception at Zest. They really do great citrus combinations with their bar menu.

My parents would love this place. What I mean by that is that they live in a small town, so the build your own, watch them cook it is something different than what's offered in smaller towns.  For me, it was fun the first time. The second time, there's really nothing special about it. Take your big appetite friends, it's a good value for the amount of food you can have made.

Big smiles and welcoming personalities greeted us at the door. I was so relieved. I've been to other restaurants from this group and have hot and cold experiences. So, this was a great start out the gate.  Our server Brandon was attentive, full of life and kept calling me Love (which I swooned about).  We ordered a few different margaritas, the enchilada special, the fish special and appetizers. All around the food reviews were the kind where your mouth is full and you shake your head up and down and smile while pointing at the food.  Friday at 7:30PM got us seated quickly, but the place was filling up when we finished around 8:45PM.

$2.00 BREAKFAST- WOOT! Eggs, bacon, potatoes, crepes and lingonberry jam and a diet soda.   Here's what you do, on a super hot day, you get to Ikea for breakfast, stroll for a while in 70 degree climate controled warehouse and test every chair in the store. That should take about 3 hours, go get lunch  $5.00 LUNCH- Double WOOT. Swedish meatballs, lingonberry cheesecake and another diet soda.  Sneak into one of the bedroom displays, take a little siesta, creep out some customers and call it a day.

For the first 4 months I lived here, I drove past this Sprouts, another 15 minutes to get to Whole Foods. For an out of towner who'd never heard of Sprouts (and if you notice the neighborhood this one is in you'd understand why I drove by it).  Then one day, I stopped in and I was so happy. So here's what you should know: *They've got the best coffee selection in town. *Produce is healthy. It's not all organic, but it's crispy! *Cheese selection is pretty sad. *Wine and beer selection gets the job done.

This place is all about customization and fresh ingredients. They have a newer house blend they call WAKE UP and it really does! What I like about their standard coffee is that they have different blends, so that you're not stuck with the flavor of the day, but rather if you like a milder cup of coffee, they'll get you what you want.  The owner makes a lot of the breakfast pastrys too. When you can get it, the Pineapple Upside Down cake is delicious.  They have music on weekend mornings and FREE wireless access.

4 stars because they carry Blue Bell Ice Cream (which is odd for a place trying to mimic a real NY deli). I had the Brox Bomber (corned beef, pastrami, provalone, mayo and mustard) with a side of mayonaise potatoe salad. It was good and quick.  Downtown Chandler has really won me over.

I'm glad I didn't review this last night after an amazing wine tasting hosted by the Chandler Wine Enthusiast group (although it might have been more entertaining).  The food was excellent and I have to say the staff wasn't the most educated on wine BUT they were so helpful, and truly friendly.   The wine list looked like it mainly focused on French wines, but there were a few California stuck in there too.   Fun lesson learned: French wine is made to go with food. You won't find many people drinking it as a standalone beverage. The flavors really come out when you compliment it with food. Neat huh?

Still my most favorite hot dog ever and I think the magic is in the presentation. They've got the best hot dog sleeve. It perfectly holds the dog, lots of chili and it's not messy.  Another must have is a Cherry Lime Squeeze; Sprite, Cherry flavor, squeezed limes and maraschino cherries.

Swoozie's is very hot pink and bright orange and it's amazingly sweet. The store is set up into different party theme sections. So you want ideas or something easy to coordinate, they've got all the different pieces you can put together.  If you've got a "tween" this is a great spot to get extra girly fussy stuff.

"you've got to go to kandy" that's what my friend rob kept telling me. I've spent the last 4 years going to get my hair done monthly to Elizabeth Arden Red Door Salons. In texas and then in arizona. I didn't like Arden in Phoenix. It was old and uninspiring, but I went there, because of habit.  I made the change and it's faboulous. I'm hesitant to post this mainly because she's very popular and a one woman show, but sharing helps my karma and Lord knows I need some help!

It's so important to walk away from a restaurant feeling like you go value from your experience there. I did. I felt like the restuarant was romantic, sleek and I loved the open kitchen. They had the windows totally opened and it was cool, breezy and fresh.   We ordered: Limoncello Martini and Gin and Tonic $16 1 bottle of Cabernet $31 Breaded Artichokes $10 Mushroom Meatloaf $12 Spaghetti and Meatballs $12 Olive Oil Cake $9 Espresso $3

Good salsa and super crispy thick chips, with that alone Mangos (along with the other De La Cruz restaurants) is worth it for breakfast, lunch or dinner.   Their Comida Norteno is typical with cheese, refried beans and tacos. The portions are a good size, the food is flavorful, but not too greasy, cheesy or saucy. I think it's all quite delicious.   Expect them to be busy at lunch. So if you can swing an 11:30 or 12:45 lunch slot you'll have less crowds to deal with.

Arizona inspired architecture; circles and triangles, and Arizona inspired elements; water, fire, zeroscape, dominate the Tempe Center for the Arts.  They have a full Fall 07-Spring 08 schedule posted on their web site. Go for a show, but it's beautiful enough to enjoy walking around Tempe Town Lake at Sunset.

The hot dog 'hops' at this place are super cute. They wear the funny dome shape hats that look like circus tops.  Hot dogs served traditional or corny dogs and fresh squeezed lemon-aid.  They use Heinz yellow mustard, which is my favorite, and a great compliment to a really good hot dog.

The Urban Tea Loft in Downtown Chandler can compete with any chic Downtown tea shop anywhere. I swear.  The Look: Is hip, trendy, and ultra cool and inviting at the same time. Resin table tops, high back sofas and soft lighting  The Digs: Private "party rooms" for booking a client lunch or friendly birthday party at night. The rooms have a flat panel tv, IPOD plug ins and comfortable seating.  The Tea: You can brew it, buy it, sample it or you can have it loaded! That right, pay attention. You can get Tea-Tinis! Like a martini, but one of the mix-ins will be a flavored tea. I had a High Rise Tea Tini and they brewed in coconut tea.

This is as good as it gets. The sensory and educational exhibits are well organized and thought out. I suggest going to the web site to check out value packs and group rates for admission.   As of June 08, food selection is only snacks (chips, candy) from the gift shop, so plan to eat somewhere else.  My favorite exhibits have to be the CD glittering wall and the Noodle Forest.

Hurray for happy hour! 98 South has an awesome happy hour and you should totally go.  Get a dirty martini, red red wine and half price appetizers. Usually on Monday nights they have an awesome couple playing jazz. They're really cool man.  Cheers.

Chipotle in Phoenix has gone organic, hormone free with their meat! Yay! The stores in California have been using Niman Ranch meat for quite a while (they're a group of humane organic ranchers).   I don't know that AZ stores are using Niman, but they made an announcement today that they are going organic, hormone free. So your prices might be a few dimes higher, but BRAVO, Chipotle!
