I was quite surprised when I walked into the Bold Roost for the first time.  Its quaint, simple and friendly.  I like supporting smaller businesses, especially coffee shops.  I was a Starbucks employee for 4 years.  The first time I came in here there was no one here, my first impression was that it was a new place, without a client base yet.  However the owner was super friendly, and suggested the Huevos Verde sandwich after my workout, because of the protein content.  It was a delicious sandwich, and the black iced tea that I ordered was perfect.  After about an hour, there were a couple of other students in the shop studying.  Its definitely a college atmosphere.    The second time I came here, a gentleman working suggested the TTBA sandwich, and again, a win!  They really prepare their sandwiches well.    The music here is different depending on what employee is working, which I really enjoy.  Right now some trance music is playing, yesterday was Sublime and Bob Marley, 2 days ago was country.  If you are looking for a friendly coffee shop, where they bring your drink to your table, and actually try to learn your name, The Bost Roost is the place for you.  (Also, your 10th drink free isnt a bad deal either).

Was a loyal customer until a friend went in right after me and overheard the guys talking about the "queer" who comes into their shop.  They also stopped giving me military discount after this incident.  This was brought up when I was talking to one of the barbers about AZ SB 1062.  He indicated that he thought it should be legal for a business to kick out people based on their sexuality, religion or other reasons.     Haircuts are good, not the best.  When asking for skin the barbers wont go closer than a zero on the sides.  I will never go back to this place full of closed-minded pundits.

I followed Tony from his previous shop.  Top quality haircuts for an affordable price.  I am x-military and still like my haircut to be high and tight with skin on the sides.  Tony excellently executes haircuts while maintaining a friendly environment.  Its nice to have someone who remembers you and asks how you and your partner are doing, or how are classes going.  Very clean shop, and a nice BIG TV to watch!

This place is really nice. Good parking for moving trucks. Great manager; he brought us ice cold water while moving stuff out of the unit. In the 100+ degree heat, this was going above and beyond. Air conditioned hallways for storage. Would definitely recommend this place to a friend!
