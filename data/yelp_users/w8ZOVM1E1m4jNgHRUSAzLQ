Costumer service here is great, this is not one of the typical LV when you came inside the're gonna look at you from head to toe. So I would recommend this store to shop if you like shopping at LV.

People here are so mean especially the workers, when me and my boyfriend came here they were making fun of us cos we' re gay. I would never ever come back here anymore.

Ok first of all I'm moved from San Francisco to Scottsdale, I always thought that San Francisco has the best Chinese food ever, but last night I looked up for Chinese delivery places and I found this, at first I don't want to order Chinese because I'm in Arizona but I did it anyways so it turns out this Chinese food is so good and cheap. I would totally bring my family here from San Francisco for Chinese food. Definitely 4 stars:3

I love this mall, it's huge, fancy and it has a nice ambience. This mall is totally going to be on my favorite mall lists.

This hotel is amazing! The staff is very friendly, it's very  clean and it has wide space for a hotel room, nice swimming pool with a heated pool. They have free breakfast and free dinner:) and it's pretty much near with everything you need: mall, restaurants and bars:)

we had our valentines dinner here at Indian paradise, were so excited that there's Indian restaurant here in Scottsdale since we just recently moved from San Francisco. I only gave 2 stars because the food are way to expensive for what you get and thee food isn't that great either. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant at dinner time.

I always love star bucks but honestly Internet at all star bucks are horrible it's so slow and it sucks coz one of the reason I hangout in the store is to enjoy my iPad and drink my good coffee since Internet is slow then i cant to that. I wish they would update their Internet specifically this store:3
