Good food! But they keep getting the orders wrong! Went there twice! Shame! Ordered a meal and it was without fries! Ordered a nerds slush drink and recieved a slush drink without nerds! Get the order right and I'll change the stars!

The food is great and cheap. Cheaper than panda. You can't go wrong with the rice bowls, they're around $5. I always pick up so I dont know about deliveries. I recommend it.

Brought in two camera lenses to have them repaired and cleaned. This lady in charge of the repair section told me that I needed to buy another lens and/or talk with the original manufacturers and that my lens were pretty much good for paper weight. What's the point in a local camera shop if they can't even provide adequate service? Or even attempt to? Her overconfident attitude didn't help so much either. I'd be wary of this place.

Went to this shop for an allignment. The price was approx 50 bucks and months later, I had the same tire wear issue! Like I basically gave them money for them to drive my car around! Will definitely be going to another place.

I had a pleasant experience here at Discount! At first, I was skeptical to bring in my sports car for tires but I'm glad I chose this place! They do offsets and you can pick tire sizes different from the manufacturer. I had an issue with my car, but they helped me above and beyond! Ask for Eric, he knows tires!

These guys know how to cut hair! I recommend getting a haircut with any of the guys! I think they're all good personally, just avoid the lady (she isn't good compared to the others) and you should be good. Very good price for the amount of time and effort they put into their work. Average haircuts go for about 30-45 minutes. Come in when there's not a lot of people because the wait can be long due to their time in cutting hair (which is not a bad thing for quality haircuts). Way better than the big chains around here for the same price! I definitely recommend this place!

My date and I came in on a weekday so nobody was eating at the time. We were greeted by all the people that worked there with a smile and a welcome so that's awesome! The environment seemed appropriate with music and decorations. The menus were a bit faded on the back though. The servers were on track and always focused on the customers and their needs. We had a guy with a ponytail and he was awesome and funny, took the time to talk with us and recommended some items to eat! In terms of the food, we ordered crab puffs, veggie lo mein, and honey sesame chicken. The food was delicious while not bland nor over greased like other typical Chinese restaurants! They provided enough rice to balance out the meal which is normally a complaint of mine since most places don't give enough rice! I love rice since I'm Asian! Actually there was more rice than food in the end! The chicken was crispy and white, just right! The crab puffs were great too with a side of sweet and sour. But my favorite was the lo mein, it wasn't greasy and the taste was spot on. My date loves lo mein and she said it's one of the best she tasted! As for the drinks, they were never emptied since they had awesome staff! Will definitely be coming back for more! Thanks!

The burgers are sub-par. The service is questionable and is mixed. The thing that bothers me the most is their dishonesty. We called in to see about waiting times and capacity. They said there were lots of seats and no waiting time. We even told them to make sure and they insisted! When we came, the place was full and had a waiting time! I don't support any kind of dishonesty in any profession/work area. Hence the 1 star. Cheers!

Don't park here. The garage spaces are small and I scratched my car on a guard post trying to park, and I know how to park cars!

I decided to try a new barber shop in the area because I was getting tired of my old one. I came in right when they opened on a weekday and there were two people getting their haircuts already. This should give you an idea of how busy they can get? This place has a more quiet atmosphere with the news on their tvs so it was nice to get updated on the local news. I was seated right away since there were three barbers at the time. Juan was my barber and this guy takes his time and effort into making sure you have a good haircut! You know you have a good haircut when the barber spends almost an hour cutting your hair! He really focuses on the details and angles of your hair to make sure it is a good clean cut! I asked for a fade with a comb over and part, it was spot on! Not only that, you get a warm moist towel around your head and a shoulder and upper back massage with this hand device they have. The experience was pleasant from the beginning to the end, I almost fell asleep from the comfort! I will definitely be coming back! Keep it up!

Food sucks! And they charged guacamole which was not asked for! Absurd and a thief of a business! Close down now!

Terrible place! Don't ever go here! I've seen their rushed and imperfect work. Definitely not worth the money you spend here. By all means, come here if you want to waste your money on some hack job they call service here! Anyone, ANYBODY, can do a better job than these moronic fools! To the employees, if you don't like what you're doing, which is providing service to uplift your customers in terms of nail aesthetics, then don't work here and do something else with your lives. Common sense! They honor no respect to returning customers. If something is flawed in their work, then they WILL NOT fix it for you! I've been to many businesses that will make the customer happy by fixing anything THEY did wrong! Barbershops, restaurants, car washes, you name it. They would give their service for free, fix the problem, and/or provide free service in the future! Quite the opposite in this estate. This is exactly how you lose customers and eventually the business will go underneath. They deserve it as any bad business should. Pretty much a place to scam people out of their hard-earned money. Good luck, you'll need it. More like "Scam Nails & Spa". Don't bother replying to me here, owners. Trying to cover your true nature, psh.

They get the job done. The only place closest to Chinese food in this area. The workers seem like they don't really care. And my main gripe is that they served the shrimp way too soon one time, tasted like fish than honey so I knew it was undercooked. And I'm not a picky eater!

This is during the late hours. The MANAGER was very rude and said some very inappropriate things along the lines of "Thanks for ordering a big order, we only have three people working and that made our day so thank you for that!" As of this date 12/26/15 at approximately 12am, the guys needs to be fired for this. Will probably be calling for complaints about this. You should be professional wherever you work at regardless. Most terrible service ever! Worst of all Jack in the Box! Never got the name because he left right away after throwing the food at us.

Great place for a fast and inexpensive car wash! Done in minutes and the car looks clean for the amount of time used! Just follow the steps and you'll be fine!

The place looks not so clean and the food tastes bland compared to other buffets! Look someplace else.

The food here is cheap and decent amount of portions. But what they lack is customer service and a genuine one at that. I don't know if it's the Asian culture, but they don't really acknowledge you here after leaving food or refilling the water. A smile or a "You're welcome" would be a start but they don't do that here. They almost failed my refill drink test where I was out of water and they didn't refill the water till I complained. You guys serve the people with food and service as this area of the business/restaurant REQUIRES it, or don't serve anyone at all.

Pretty good food and selection overall. Came in during a weekday so it wasn't busy at all. Some of the entrees are good, some are a little less than expected quality for the price. The environment seems a bit subpar and a typical generic Chinese restaurant. The food will get the job done and satisfy that hunger! Try it!

Hello all! First off, this place was recommended to me. So I brought in my phone to get repairs done on the screen as well as some "software issues" I've been experiencing. The staff were very helpful and professional. They were upfront and truthful about the costs and services I'd be paying for. I accepted their service and they were finished faster than I'd expected! My phone looked like-new and they cleaned up my software which turned out to be something minor! Impressive! I definitely recommend this place for anyone looking to get the repairs done for their Apple stuff! Very competent technicians! I would not go anywhere else! Thanks guys! PS: They have accessories as well!

A small secluded but great estate! What a gem! They have multiple options and their ice cream is superb! Definitely use their Yelp promo to gain a discount! The employees are attentive and patient to newcomers and will let us trying any ice cream in order to have an awesome experience with them. I definitely recommend this place! 5-Stars.

So this is my second experience with Mac I Am. This is a semi-recent location that happened to be near where I live! This place is a mini-version of the other location. Don't let the size of the shop fool you, just as effective and competent on their repairs and services. This location is pretty unique compared to its sister location: it is shared with a small boutique shop so you would either have to go through the front of the store entrance or through the back which you should find the repair place to the  left right after this entrance. Actually, I like how this works because 1) you are greeted with friendly people and unique Scottsdale merchandise of the boutique and 2) you shop around the area while you wait for your repairs! Look for their sandwich sign to find the location!  Anyways, I brought in my one of my family members iPhone because it had started acting up and the screen was pretty banged up! The associate of Mac I Am Mel was helping me get the repairs done! Very professional and kind, he helped through every step of the repair from the cost estimate to out the door content on their services! Repairs were fast and the costs were very reasonable to even cheap! I peeked a few times during the repair and he seemed to know his Apple merchandise. Very focused and passionate! Not only that, I had a few questions about my macbook pro and he helped me answer and solve some of my issues with it! We tested the iPhone to ensure its been fully repaired and it worked great if not even better than before! I picked up an iPhone case, charger, and headphones to complement the phone! Left with the stuff repaired, more knowledge about my stuff, and content with services and items I paid for! Thanks Mel and Mac I Am for another pleasant experience with your business! I'll definitely come back again! No other place can't even compare! Hands down, come to this shop.

The boba drinks are all right at best. I usually get the Thai tea drink at other places but it tastes like it's watered down here. Shame.
