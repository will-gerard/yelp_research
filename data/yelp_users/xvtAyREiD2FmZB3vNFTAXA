Roommate raved about this place so I had to check it out. Happy I did. Had the Artichoke and spinach dip appitizer. For dinner the Jambalaya. And for dessert the White Chocolate Brownie. Service was spot on for a Saturday night. (They were busy) I will return cause this place made my tummy Happy.

Yum yum Spinach Dip. Like the Tacos there as well and the Wings aren't bad either. Will return for more good eats and beer specials.

Very disappointed in the service and the management. Never been here before. Went with a friend. We arrived and were seated. Ordered our water. And took some time to look over the menu. (couple got seated next to us) We finally get our order in. I have 2 rolls and my friend wants 2 rolls. We wait....the couple next to us orders and gets their rolls first. Then my rolls arrive. Figured my friends rolls should be up any second. 5min go by, nothing. We ask someone what's taken so long. Our server returns and says she forgot to put the order in but it should be right up. 10min go by, then 15min. The couple next to us pays and leaves. We have now been here 45min. Was suppose to be a quick bite. My friend goes to complain to the manager, at this point no rolls yet. She nicely informs him of the situation and his response is, "What do you want me to do about it"? Very poor manager skills. Never have I had a manger respond not my problem to a customer before. My friend said when her rolls did come that she shouldnt have to pay for them because of the long wait. The manager refused and even got upset about it. (Not sure why?) What happened next was just crazy. He says he's going to call the police because it is robbery. How is it robbery? The rolls aren't on the table. When they did arrive he wanted to take one away cause he said he would only pay for one. But two where ordered. So why would you take it away? You never want to think it is because I am a person of color and this is why you are acting this way toward me but in this case it really seemed that was deal. Why else call the cops because you provided bad service. My friend and I did nothing but be patient and wait for our food and express our dislike of service. It was pretty simple fix. But it escalated to something it should not have been. Shame on you-Not to mention they are overpriced and the food isnt even that good. I wont be given my business to them again.

Went here spur of the moment. They did a great job. I just got a plain pedicure. My friend got a more advance one. But we still sat together. Great job by the staff. I would return.

This is my favorite Sushi Place. I really like the fact that they dont feel the need to place that krab stick in all there rolls. Perfect Happy Hour prices and all my fave rolls are on it. :-)
