We had family in town and I didn't want to cook. I get tired of pizza or subs for larger groups (10 of us) and wanted something fairly healthy. I thought of Rubio's and wasn't disappointed! Everything was ready on time, and our burritos and salad were delicious. I'll definitely use Rubio's again for my catering needs.

I love Copenhagen furniture. I love the style. We looked high and low for the perfect sectional for our family room and Copenhagen had the only stylish one we could find. We loved the built in recliners and cup holders. We had good service during the ordering process, but they told us it would take four or five months and it took like 9 months. We kept having to call and check on it, too--they never called us first.  Then, when we finally got it -- it kept breaking! In the year that we've had it, it's never been fully operational. The furniture repair shop that they use can't get the parts from Italy, it takes months to get the parts, then once they get them the furniture repair company can't get us on the schedule for months.   We are not hard on furniture. We don't have little kids jumping on it. It's for sitting on and watching TV. A sofa should be able to do that without being broken.

We were looking for someplace to watch the Sounders game and figured this was our best bet, but unfortunately, they weren't able to show it. Despite that, we stayed and had a great time. Food was awesome...shepherd's pie A+, corned beef and cabbage A+, chicken curry A+, fish and chips A+ (and, since we are from Seattle, we are seafood critics and this was DELISH). But the best of all had to be the candied bacon on the cheese board. FANTASTIC! We are going to try to replicate at home, and I'm looking forward to the challenge. Great service (our server's 2nd day!) and best of all, best place to see the Seahawks and Huskies!

Not sure why this place only has 3 stars. We have been here probably 10 times and every time the service is great and the food is delicious. On special, we've had amazing scallops (I don't even like scallops, but they were to die for) and a fantastic gorgonzola steak (my son was dissapointed tonight that it was only a special!).   The beet salad is my fave and I have tried to recreate it to no avail. The white mushroom truffle pizza is INCREDIBLE. The pulled pork sandwich...delish!   The owner is always there. He always comes around to see how your dinner was. Can't think of another restaurant where this is so.  The have nice indoor and outdoor seating for watching the (always amusing) Scottsdale Quarter crowd.   Sure our server tonight was new and brought cokes instead of pibbs, but there is not much they could improve upon here. I'd give it 4.5 if I could! The prices are great for the food you are served. It is a fun, friendly atmosphere. We love this place!

Yum, yum, and more yum! We ate outside on a lovely evening. Started off with the pork belly (not to be missed) and the artichoke/goat cheese dip. Great starters! There we three of us: my husband had the skirt steak with to-die-for truffle mac n cheese, I had the pork osso bucco, our friend had the "Kitchen" burger. Note: Skip the burger and go for the other stuff.  Ignore the fact that their wood door makes the place look like it's closed and under construction (and the hostesses will tell you that they hear that multiple times every night). Once you get inside, the decor is hip and comfortable.  We will definitely be back! (I'd give it 5 stars if it wasn't for the burger and the door!)

I had been craving ramen for a while, but haven't found any good ramen places in Phoenix, so pho was the next best thing. After a Yelp search, we were in the area and decided to try Pho Viet. Man, we were not disappointed! But we didn't even have the pho! I had the egg noodle soup #41 and my hubby had the rice noodle ham hock soup #36. Both were delicious and filling. It was pretty busy for a Saturday afternoon so that was a good sign. Everything they brought out looked so good...I will definitely be back because I want to try one of everything on the menu. Peter introduced himself as I was paying the bill--nice owner and wait staff. Highly recommend!

Oh man! This is our GO TO pizza place! We always get the same thing...hubby gets The Italian Stallion, I get the Pizza Bianca with spinach and mushrooms, and we share the caprese salad. Love that I can order online and it was 15 minutes EARLIER than the estimated time we were given. Also, love that I can choose thin crust. The Party size is HUGE and so fun with a crowd. Love that they are in our 'hood!
