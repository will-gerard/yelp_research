There is nothing wrong with the units themselves... other than the fact that if something doesn't work, or if there is an inconvenience, you will have to live with it.   The problem with this place is the INEPT or NON-EXISTENT CUSTOMER SERVICE. Most, if not all, of the staff there either claim to have no power to help with your situation (the constant smell of drugs from a neighboring unit, for example), or flat-out refuse to help altogether.   In addition, we scrubbed the entire place from top to bottom (my girlfriend is a neat freak), and they REFUSED TO GIVE THE DEPOSIT BACK. We changed units  halfway through, and in both cases of moving out, they cheated honest tenants out of $200.   Moving in here would be playing Russian Roulette- if there's nothing wrong with your unit, or if you don't mind losing your deposit money because you're going to trash the place anyway, this is the spot for you. If you plan on getting quality for your money and having people care about your needs, move along.

Wow. Really great hash! I appreciate that this brunch place gives you a seasonal menu outside of their regular fare.   The benches in the place are a little shallow, and I'm a big guy, so there was slight discomfort; however, the quality of service and food quickly made me forget any tweaks I would make to the seating situation.   The portions are great, and even an arugula salad was elevated and tasty. We'll definitely be coming back!

This place is great. Super easy to work with, very personable service and great scenery! They flew the actual bar in from Ireland, so the whole establishment itself is a conversation piece!   The food has been consistently great, and the servers went out of their way to make my guests and myself feel at home.

I'm a big fan of Thai food, and I've been to the others surrounding Mill. But this one wins. By far the best tasting Pad Thai in Arizona!   It's atmosphere is great, their staff personable, and hours are amazing! If you want the best Thai experience in town, make this your first stop!

This is a terrific, terrific bagel spot. Man oh man. The bagels are fresh, the service is quick and helpful and the food is delicious. Feels family owned and authentic. If you're in Mesa, look no further for a great breakfast and support a local business!   I love a lox bagel. This morning (my third or fourth time here) they gave me.... This (photo added)! I mean... That's just impressive. Thanks guys!

This theater us the best discount cinema you will ever visit, period. Management has invested a lot into a quality movie experience, from projection to excellent seating. It is affordable, centrally located, and has a terrific professional staff. I love coming here!

Marvelous. Unique. Filling and accommodating. Would go here so so often if I could, or if I could eat this much all the time!   Fair warning- places like this are usually a flat $50 + alcohol, so if you are on a date plan to spend at least $150.   If you haven't experienced Brazilian steakhouse before, you are missing out on a terrific culinary experience.   The salad bar is terrific, and gives you an opportunity to load up with the greens, the fruits and the starches. It is a top notch salad bar.   Then when you sit down, you are treated to a cavalcade of delicious meats being served to you, one at a time, to accompany your meal. You can have as many as you want, and as much as you want. The quality of the cuts and their preparation is of the calibre you would expect at the nicest steakhouse- but this is all you can eat.   Truly a great place for celebration, I'll be returning!

A disappointing grooming service that makes many promises and delivers on very few.   We took our airedale there today after confirming with the receptionist that they were in fact familiar with the cut of the dog.   When we arrived the groomer looked incredibly nervous about the task, and we ended up having to show her multiple pictures from Google on how the cut was supposed to look. Still visibly uncomfortable with the task, they got another groomer who assured us that she herself knew how to handle it.   We left with the promise it would take 2-3 hours. It ended up taking 5 hours and 15 mins. She had loose hairs on her when finished, and clearly hadn't been relieved.  She also had the WRONG CUT, and we learned the nervous woman was the one who actually did the grooming, not the one who reassured us about their competency. The eyebrows and general cut of the airedale was made to be closer to a jack russell (very different groom). When asked if we could get it fixed they hemmed and hawwed and basically told us no it would be too much trouble.   At the end of the day, our dog's nails were done well, and she did get her hair cut (so that's something); but the quick promises to get us in the door and poorly delivering on them was very disappointing and disruptive.

This is a decent middle eastern place (Lebanese I believe), but I have a few problems that keep me from coming back regularly.  * the place is a little dumpy. I'm typically OK with kitschy furnishings if the building is a small space or a dive bar, but this is trying to look nice and really only coming across as cheap.  * the food is OK - but everything on the menu is a little too fried.  * their portions are always huge. If you like taking food home, this is great; otherwise, you'll either eat way too much or waste food.  * their service is pretty dang slow. I always get the feeling that they'll come around to me when they want to. I think most of the staff are family, which may explain the complacency.   The pros are that is has:  * other than the fried stuff, the food is very good * good location, and next to a hookah lounge * authentic cuisine  Give it a whirl, but keep the expectations down. Also make sure you have lots of time on your hands, because they certainly do.

Yuck. Terrible pizza. If I want bad cheap pizza, I'll go to Little Caesars. There is nothing special about this place, other than it makes pizza... Just like everyone else.

I love this place. They deliver on a trendy cool place to eat, very broad selection, and everything's good. I've been going here for close to a year to have brunch and I always walk away feeling well fed, never gross or bloated.

This place is my JAM. Both my wife and I's Jam, actually. This place has everything. Burgers, sandwiches, salads, entrees, deserts, beer and cocktails.   It is bar food at its best and most elevated at a reasonable price. Want to go to Chili's? Think again--- think Thirsty Lion. Want to get some great brewskies at a great price? Thirsty Lion. Want a place where you want to watch the game and enjoy great ambiance with friends or clients? Thirsty. Fucking. Lion.   Also, they have the BEST spinach artichoke dip. E-VER.   James out.

This place has pretty dry and bland food for the price (for two people you WILL spend at least $20). The food isn't bad... It's just that it's pretty uninteresting. But if you want to pay a premium for a health moniker this is your place. Not for me tho.

Service was fine-  place was fine but the pizza was okay. It's good pizza. It's just not the best we've ever had. I would expect more from a brick oven pizza place and the price that they charge.

This was close by where I work so thats why I gave it a shot initially. I got to say it's not much to look at, and a little bit of haggling is expected if you're spending more than $100. They will take a little longer than hey estimate, depending on how poor your car's condition is.   But what I can say is no one has ever, ever done a better job cleaning and detailing my car. All the buttons on my console, every detail was covered and better than new. The outside of the car was as smooth as butter and more lustrous than I ever remember it.   I wasn't going to tip on account of how long it took them, but when I looked at the job they did, how thoroughly they waxed and sealed, I couldn't help but be impressed.   I'm definitely coming back. I will be bringing a book though!

Wow. Every time I come here I leave full, excited about the food I ate, and with a great feeling in my stomach.   My friends and I came here to the restaurant after a night of canvassing around First Friday, and while it did take a while to get a table, once we sat down... It was all good. The appetizers were hearty and flavorful. The drinks were cold and fresh. The food was inventive and fun. It's always terrific to try new things here.   Our service was from someone who was busy, sure, but really worked hard to make sure we had everything we needed to have a great time.   I don't always eat in downtown Phoenix, but when I do, I prefer Short Leash.

Super mediocre food and very slow service. It took the grill 30 minutes for the most basic burger on earth and my beer was kind of warm. Only eat here if you don't care about money, time or quality.   It's one thing to have slow service. It's another to try and woof down your food 5 minutes before you board, when you got there 45 minutes before your flight, and the waiter placate you and tell you it isnt actually boarding yet. Yuck.

On reading my prior review, I was contacted by someone from Snooze and they offered to pay for me giving them another shot at their Benedict. They sent me a handwritten note, which impressed me- few people do that!  I returned and everything was perfect. The dish was seasoned very well and cooked to perfection; the atmosphere was buzzing and the servers very prompt and friendly. Such a cool location too.   I'm stoked I found another terrific brunch place in Tempe!

I came here for my birthday party, and the place looks nice (more like a nightclub than a traditional bowling alley). However, my fiance and I did not feel welcome at all for our party of 16.   First of all, we called ahead to see if lanes needed to be reserved. We were advised to just show up at 7:00pm on a Friday night and ask for two lanes. Upon arriving, we were met with a very standoffish manager, who flat out sneered when we asked if there was a chance of getting three lanes next to each other (which again, we had called ahead to ask on the best way to get them). When we settled for two lanes, the manager rolled his eyes and said that it would be a 30 minute wait, and then went to doing something else. We asked if we needed to give him a name, as we'd all be hanging out in the bar section. He said "no, I'll come get you when we're ready."  After an hour of waiting at the bar and having other people's names (again, they took names for other people) at the bar called for their lanes, we went back over to the manager to ask how much longer it'd be, to which we got the condescending reply that "oh, they have lanes ready now." We asked why he hadn't notified us of this, and he replied again "well they're ready now."  Fine.   He asked how many people were bowling, and at that moment there were six, to which he said we could only have one lane if that were the case (again, not new information for him). So we got an extra person to bowl so we could get two lanes. Again, an eye roll from this guy.   Afterwards, the wait staff and service from the rest of the establishment was acceptable to great (hence the two stars, not one). Our lane did keep glitching and knocking over random pins on the reset (which is OK for us- we're all casual once-in-a-while bowlers and not extremely competitive). It was also a little weird that the music videos playing on the 12+ screens never once matched up with what the DJ was playing.  We were very surprised about the price. For appetizers, three pitchers of beer, and three games of bowling amounted to $375. For us, being used to AMF and Brunswick-style lanes, this was much more than expected.   Overall, it was a good time for us because we had each other's company, beer, and food. But it was definitely in spite of some staff management that treated us like lepers (and none of us were leprous... that I know of).   Don't come here unless you want to pay way more for bowling than you ever have and want to be looked down on as a big inconvenience while you do it.

My wife and I wanted to try something different for lunch on the way home from church. Yelp brought up this place and we decided to try it out.   Really delicious! It's a very different take on the burger- so be prepared for a place that serves them completely differently than normal.   They stuff their burgers. This means exactly what you think it does. And yes it works! They cut their burgers in half and serve them almost like hotdogs, serving the fixings on the side so you can assemble them to whatever style you'd prefer.   Their signature outrageous sauce is pretty good.   They bring out the fries to your table before the burger, treating them like appies which is kinda fun. However, it is a very salty meal, whichever option you go with, so be prepared for a very fast food tribute!  Would go again!

Great spot for sandwiches in Mesa/Gilbert. The quality of the meats they use is phenomenal, and their  breads are really soft and substantial.   The atmosphere is typical modern chic- smooth cement pour structures, astro-turf grass that feels good on the feet and nice picnic benches and places to sit and eat- both in and out of the shade.   A good refreshing place!

This is my GO TO spot for takeout!! These guys do American Teriyaki right. Really sweet dishes, friendly people, and a clean place. I go here about once a week when I have a night in and want to grab some great lo mien noodles, steak or chicken, and some egg rolls. Savory and filling!   Basically the Smash Burger equivalent of chinese/asian cuisine. Don't expect world class food... Just really good comfort food!   Definitely recommend!!

I was really surprised at how nice this place was. The food was really good, reasonably priced, and the concept is really fun! I'm definitely coming here again, because I originally drove to this location for the Smash Burger next door; however seeing a fish type place looked more healthy and refreshing, and boy did it deliver!   Their sauces are amazing! And it's a great place to sit down and chat with friends!

This place is great, at a great price. The atmosphere is very modern yet accommodating. It's located in the nice, chic historic district of downtown Gilbert, and serves pizza.   The wait staff was impeccable. We were very well attended to, and Katie, our server, was very efficient and pleasant- rare to see in any profession!   Our food was also very good; the meatballs were very well put together and seasoned (I noticed a few other patrons using them as additional toppings on the pizzas they ordered.   The pizza is made naples-style, and is fire-kilnes in a certain manner leaving the crust on the outside crispy and soft in the middle. This was great, but my only note is that the pizza I ordered (the Pomo)... Seemed like its toppings were pretty lop-sided. However, the ingredients used on it were top notch and tasted great.   We left filled and happy.

The building is awesome and caught my eye on my regular commute. A big fan of breweries in general, I was excited to try fate out.   The interior is beautiful and the menu is interesting. The poutine was pretty good, even though they were pretty sparing with the toppings.  The food, however, was very, very mediocre. Bland and a little dry. They burnt my date's pizza a little bit as well, and it too was fairly bland and unsavory. They took a long time to get me the beer I ordered, and I could tell it had been sitting on the bar waiting for some time, so it wasn't really that cold.   We did wait a little while for service, though nothing out of the ordinary for a place this busy.   Mostly the food is just forgettable and disappointing.

THEY HAVE GREEN RIVER SODA O MY GOSH THEY HAVE GREEN RIVER SODA!!!  Ok, so outside of the fact that they have Green River Soda, which you can tell I'm a fan of (a crappy but sentimental Chicago tradition), this is a SOLID SOLID SOLID Ice Cream spot. A perfect way to top off your downtown Gilbert dining experience.   It's a smaller venue, so you may want to get your order to go or spot a table you think you might want to sit at.   I ordered a double scoop of chocolate chip cookie dough, which is by far my most favorite ice cream... Of all time. They are generous with their portions (bring it on) so you'll never feel skimped (one scoop was... Probably all I needed in hindsight--- but Ice Cream, amiright?).   Their staff is friendly, and the place was clean, without the typical sticky syrupy ice cream countertops and tables. Great job guys, I'm looking forward to coming back!
