Let me just say I have attended this church since I was around 7-8 years old. I love the sermons so much that I can get through the music. They have progressively gotten more and more like a rock concert. Some people may like that, I prefer a little more traditional/humble music in church. Don't get me wrong, my favorite band is system of a down. I really do enjoy hard music. I attended the Christmas eve service and after watching a lip sync battle my family and I walked out. I get that they have to appeal to a changing generation. I happen to be in the age range of the generation that they are trying to appeal to. This does not appeal to me. After 20 some odd years of attending this church, I'm sorry to say I won't be returning. I hope this gets to the right ears because I can't imagine I am the only member who feels this after watching probably one of the best nae nae dances I have ever seen (yup they really did that in a chistmas eve service).

Had my spare ball drilled based off of my first ball. Love the fitment. Cost was competitive to others, but for the quality this place was perfect for me. Also am in the process of having an old balled filled and redrilled. Looked at the balls he had in stock and seemed like the cost seemed lower than comparable balls at other places.

He came over to the girlfriends house to re-key the rear sliding glass door as well as the front door to the same key as the security door. The locks required different kinds of keys therefore they had to be replaced to be able to use one key for different locks. He had all hardware in truck necessary to complete the job on the spot. I even got to choose the finish of the knob that would match the security door. Being the boyfriend of the homeowner I had a budget that I had to stick too because she was at work and unavailable to change it.The locksmith work with me on price. On top of the great work he did, he was also a very personable guy. I ended up just chatting a bit not even about locks. Would definitely use him again and would recommend to anyone.

Catfish is definitely great. They have one of the best baked Mac and cheese in town. Food is all prepared fresh right when you order it. Wait time is a bit long, but well worth.

Been here a few times. Very convenient location to my home. Love their torta's, however the fact that they come with ruffle chips is a little strange. On some of the larger tortas you could probably get away with splitting the meal, or bringing it home with you. Salsa is spicier than many other Americanized mexican food restaurants, which is an added plus.  At the end of the meal they give you a dum dum lollipop. Only gripe would be the fact that their margaritas are non alcoholic. They should really splurge on getting that liquor license.
