Came here for some drinks after a rehearsal dinner. I can't speak about the food but the bartender and service was great. I expected a Friday night in downtown Charlotte to be busy and hard to get drinks but it wasn't that hard. Yes, it was busy but the bartenders were on top of it. They seemed to get to each person quickly and made the drinks quickly. I was very impressed. The drink prices seems on par for what you would expect  as well. I liked it and the atmosphere of the bar.

So I will say the service was impeccable. We came for lunch and it was surprisingly not busy. We had a baby with us and instead of using high chairs, they have one that connects to the table. I like that so much more because then the baby isn't sticking out in the aisle and they can feel included in the meal as well and right by mom/dad/whomever. They offer a very large bar with some craft cocktails. Only 2 of us were drinking and only one get a cocktail. It was a moscow mule. The drink itself was good, nothing over the top and it didn't come in a copper cup. They do have a good wine selection, somewhat limited in by the glass options but I made due and got a really nice Sav Blanc from New Zealand. I will say the pour is a little heavy and I love it! As for the food, 2 people split the Hawaiian ribeye as per the recommendation of our server. The portion was large for one person so it was perfect for 2. They asked for medium and it came medium with some parts a little medium rare so they were very happy. The char on it was perfect. My husband got the famous french dip. It was enormous. I think it was about 6 inches thick and mostly meat. It also looked like it was freshly sliced meat because it didn't have that dark brown crusted edge to it but was pink and clean cut. It was excellent. The portion was also huge, he struggled to finish it. Finally, I got the Thai steak salad and wow! I can't wait to go back and get it again. The amount of dressing was just right, it had a great spice to it but not enough that I wanted to grab water every few seconds. The portion was very large but I had no problem finishing it and basically licking the plate after. I would highly recommend this one. We finished the meal with their famous ice cream sundae. Before you laugh, it was more than enough for 4 of us to share and they give you a gravy boat of hot fudge on the side. Did you hear me- a GRAVY boat full of fudge. Yes, we used our spoons and finished the fudge that way. Definitely worth the calories.

This place definitely deserves all 5 stars. We came here on a recent trip to Scottsdale and this was recommended to us. We sat down and were promptly met by our waitress. She explained the menu to us and how the menu is set up. They have a great beer selection for Asian fusion and they were more than willing to let us sample a few that we haven't heard of before. Also, if you check in on Yelp, you get free Edamame. The portions are very big and the service was great. Below you will see what we ate.  Food: Edamame: done just right with a good amount of salt Potstickers: You can tell they are homemade. I wasn't a huge fan but I like the store bought ones. The other 2 people I was with really enjoyed them. Lings Seafood Hot Pot: Fantastic- the curry and coconut milk go together perfectly. It had a lot of mussels in it and it was really good. Just spicy enough but the coconut helped calm it. Budda's Feast with steak- steak was done perfectly and the portion was huge. I got mine with the brown rice and it complimented it well. The veggies were cooked to perfection and the sauce was awesome. I am so sad I left my leftovers at the place we were staying. Surf and Turf- Again, another excellent dish. The portion was great, steak was cooked just right, lots of veggies and the shrimp was not overcooked at all. We got the fried rice with this one and wow- best fried rice I have ever had. It was fresh and you could certainly tell.  I very much recommend going there. I wish there were one closer that I could go to again. The only tip I would give to people going there is: don't order too many apps because the portions are big and you will get full quickly.

Oh my WOW. So very good. We came here with friends that have been to Scott's restaurants in New York and LA and loved them both. And our food was amazing! First off the bread they give is amazing. You get various traditional Italian breads including stromboli. The olive oil butter was fantastic with it. We then got the endive and apple salad and polenta. The salad was fresh and delicious but the polenta was heaven!! Even the mushrooms (I only tried the juice from them) was great. I could eat that polenta everyday. As for dinner, we tried various things but most of us tried the spaghetti. It was funny because my friends recommended it and I almost laughed with them recommending the most basic dish on the amazing menu but I listen. Glad I did- I now have dreams about the spaghetti. I actually asked to go back the next day and get it again but we didn't have time. I have now scoured the internet to get the recipe. Very very highly recommended. We also tried the Pici and Agnolotti. Both were to die for. The agnolotti was actually a huge hit at our table. It is heavy and rich but just melts in your mouth.   This place was great and the service was very good. Honestly not a bad thing to say about it. I live in So. Cal and am planning a trip to go back to his LA restaurant as soon as I can.

We came here because we have been to the San Diego one and loved it. Beware, they get very crowded at all times. But that is pretty much the same story for any good food place in Vegas. The menu is a little smaller than the normal Hash House but the food was delicious. I got the Farm Scramble with tomatoes, goat cheese and basil. I really really enjoyed that. The goat cheese was the perfect pairing for it. We also got their bloodies- the bacon one. I liked it but it was pretty spicy which I did not expect. It didn't say it was going to be spicy on the menu like some of the others did. It was harder to drink for me. Also, their bloody mary menu is very tiny compared to the normal Hash House which was a little disappointing. All in all, the food and service were really good just don't expect a great selection when it comes to bloodies (something they are known for).

We came here for a later, lighter dinner. We had a person in our group that wasn't a fan of fish so they wanted more of the vegetarian type rolls. We had a large lunch so we decided to split 4 rolls between the 4 of us instead of each getting 2 rolls like we usually would if we were eating a full dinner. So we ordered the Dragon roll, spicy Dragon roll, veggie roll and california roll. Personally, I don't like the California roll because it's a basic roll but theirs is good and fresh so I appreciated it. I really liked the Dragon roll. The shrimp seemed to be a little small for it but then again, I am used to huge fresh shrimp due to living in Cali. It did offer large pieces of eel on top though so that definitely made up for it. And the avocado that tops it was very fresh and not browning at all so you know it was good. The portion was the normal size, I think we got about 6-8 pieces from it. I didn't try the spicy Dragon simply because my husband did and said it would be too spicy for my taste. He said the topping and sauce was very spicy but loved it- get this if you like spicy! The veggie roll was interesting because it had a salad like quality to it. It has lettuce and kale in it. I thought it was very clever that they did it. I actually would get this one again and use it as a pallet cleanser between bites of a heavier roll. The service was quick, took about 20 minutes for all of them. We took it too go so we didn't get enough soy sauce or chopsticks so double check that if you get a to go order.

First off, when you get here you wonder if you are the right place. It looks like a hole in the wall from the outside and it isn't in the safest of places (late at night). But once you walk in, you are greeting with a delicous smell of BBQ and walls of true Razorback fans! The inside is completely different the outside. This place is true BBQ. Everything was fantastic and the owner is really, really nice. We all got something different and there wasn't one back thing. I got the beef ribs which were literally fall off the bone. We also got the smoked meatloaf and pulled piggy sandwich. The piggy sandwich was very tender and moist but the star of the meals really was the meatloaf. I don't like meatloaf but I liked this one. It isn't your traditional meatloaf, it is smoked and BBQ. So very good. The portions are huge as well! You really don't need too many sides if any but if you do get some, the greens are good, yams and mac n cheese are good! I bet the rest are as well. I highly recommend going here! Yum!

The service and food here was fantastic! We came here because of the reviews and it lived up to them entirely. We actually were surprised to find out they had a $30 prix fix style menu I believe. You got a few choices for starter, dinner and dessert. I HIGHLY recommend doing that. Below is the food we got: -Corn chowder- creamy base, very good, lots of corn in it -local greens- who doesn't love goat cheese on a salad? Yum! -Salmon (we all got it)- fantastic, nice crisp, flavorful, the soy vinegarette complimented it well, cooked perfectly -white chocolate cheesecake- very good and dense- just like a cheesecake should be -red velvet torte- good but didn't have that "bam-red velvet" taste -s'mores trifle- the favorite hands down. It tasted like a s'more with a warm brownie base! Yumx3!  So the food and service was great! My only complaint was the bathrooms. The ladies bathroom downstairs has 2 stalls and both were out of toliet paper- no biggie- I asked the hostess for more. She looked and couldn't find any, so she asked the manager who also could not find any. They then sent me upstairs to use that bathroom. The manager walked in before me (which I thought was strange as it was a man) and I walked in to find a single stall with no one in there. There is a second door that was unlocked going into the kitchen. So basically I was using the employees bathroom and boy did it stink!!!! It smelled like dirty wet gym socks that have been locked in there for a week. It was awful. And on top of it, it was awkward because how is the kitchen staff supposed to know that someone is in there so I locked that door- probably locking the staff out of the bathroom (oops- but I didn't want someone walking in on me). I later overheard the manager saying something about  not having any toliet paper- which I thought was very strange. So loss of a star for the facilites not being kept up.

I hadn't stayed at a Hyatt House before but thought it's a Hyatt so it should be good- and it was. The staff was very friendly to us, they offer fruit at the front desk and specialty water for free. We stayed here twice in a week period. The rooms were alot bigger than we thought- almost a suite size. It had a sitting area and small kitchen area. The rooms were very clean and the staff was very attentive. And they offer a fantastic free breakfast complete with an omelet station- YUM. They also have a bar with a decent selection of local beers instead of the usual miller, bud, etc. And the price was not only competitive but actually a bit cheaper than those around. I'd stay here again.

This is probably one of the worst Starbucks I have ever been too. The service wasn't good, the place was a mess and very dirty (see pictures) and they only offer pictures of food (see picture). When you walk in you see a counter full of empty boxes and stacks of paper, next to it is an empty glass case with pictures of food and signs for food but no food and below is a nearly empty cooler that should have additional drinks and food. Once you get to the counter, you barely get a greeting and have to order. I tried ordering a soy latte but they said they were out of soy. How are you out of an ingredient like that in a coffee place? Either way, I ordered something else, they were slow in making it and we left. It's unfortunate because the location is great.
