Best Mexican food we've found so far. Great bakery, sometimes they have trays of what I call Mexican sliders. Small round sandwiches, one has ham, a sliced jalapeno pepper, and shredded cheese. If you order the fish dinner it comes with the head on. Very tasty. Meats you won't find anywhere else, cabeza, lengua.

The Bakery is closed. Sign says they are looking to open next week, and another says they are looking for a baker. No idea how old the signs are.

Went to register and file title on used vehicle we purchased. No muss, no fuss. So much nicer than the Arizona  MVD Zoo.  Don't mind paying a little for the extra service.

We love this place. Been going once a week for a few months, the staff knows us and are very friendly. Always the same faces, usually a good sign. We had stopped going there a few years back because the food was not the best.  They have improved a lot. Yesterday the staff was wearing orange t-shirts to promote a new menu based on the Lorax movie coming out soon. Tried the Green Eggs and Ham with Rooty Tooty Bar-Ba-Looty Blueberry Cone Cake, "a fluffy pancake with blueberries in a crispy waffle cone, topped with blueberry compote and sprinkled with powdered sugar". It was actually pretty good. My wife had the same with truffula chip pancakes consisting of "whole wheat pancakes filled with rainbow sprinkles, topped with more sprinkles and a creamy strawberry yogurt sauce".  She thought they were too sweet,. This menu seems to be aimed at kids, and it was working. We go early and seldom see kids, but the place was full of them Friday.

Got there about 5:30 left at 7:00. Very slow service. Our waiter seemed to lose interest in our table when we didn't order cocktails or appetizers before dinner. We didn't see him much after that. Other staff took care of the table. We just wanted to eat dinner. The salads were good; my spouse upgraded to Classic Caesar, the waiter said it would be a "slight" extra charge. $4.00 is slight at the Stockyards. The 12 oz. Ribeye was good, but not worth $36, I've had better. My spouse ordered the salmon and our friend the walleye. The waiter disappeared for a long time leaving us sitting with empty plates waiting for the check. I'd thought about dessert and coffee, but it took so long for the waiter to come back we didn't order any. It was my Birthday, so it was kind of a special evening for us. Sorry we went to the Stockyards to celebrate. The last time we were there during the summer, the service was excellent. We won't be back, too many good restaurants in Phoenix.

First trip, very good. Service was excellent. Had the Traditional salad, and being Sunday the Fire House Chili was being served. Probably the best chili I've had.The entree was Seared Ahi Tuna cooked to perfection.

We've been eating here at least once a month for years. Family run business, very friendly. The Dad gets a little grumpy at times, so do I. The Gyros sandwich and Falafel sandwich are good. The french fries are the best we've found in the area. Like the BBQ Ribs and Chicken. The sauce is not real spicy, but good. They have lunch specials that come with fries and a drink.

The food is very good, service is too.  I had the Steak and Shrimp bowl, my wife the Mango Chipotle Chicken Salad. Both were excellent. Great fresh salsa bar with Mango Salsa, jalapenos, and several types of hot and mild salsa. We will return.

Hadn't been here in a while. Place has been remodeled and is very clean. Andrea was the perfect person to have wait on us. She seemed to really enjoy working there. Had the Special, grilled cheese sandwich with a side and a sundae for $7.95. Everything was good. The ice cream is made on the premises, and they have special flavors, like Licorice. Peach will be available in July & August. Kids 10 & under eat free Tues and Thurs 4pm - 8pm.

We've been purchasing their rolls at various grocers in town, but they are usually sold out by Sunday. Went to the Bakery today and it was fantastic. Huge selection and baked fresh daily. Picked up some Hot Cross buns for Easter and they were the best we've found since we left San Francisco. Pumpernickel bread, Granola, and they make sandwiches. Try some hand-crafted baked goods made from quality ingredients. Friendly service, too. Closed Sunday. Buy twelve loaves get the 13th free with Loyalty Card.

Went back for our 4th or 5th time, the new Summer Lobster menu lured us in. All three of us ordered the Lobster and Shrimp Summer Salad. Big disappointment. As we drove away I said " maybe I don't really like Lobster". My companions felt it wasn't really lobster. The Shrimp wasn't that good, either. The vegetables were great, but at $22.95 for a salad, it's not worth it. My salad had half a dozen small mushrooms, my wife found only one in hers. If this had been our first visit, we would not return. We may not anyway. Suggest if this is the best they can do, 86 the salad.

The place started out well, a young woman at the counter offered to help us, before she could take our order, the phone rang. She got involved in a long order with many questions, the man at the counter finished helping his customer, glanced over and walked away without saying a word. We had never been there before, so he couldn't have had a bad experience with us, but that's how he acted. Maybe we resembled someone he hated. He wandered aimlessly around the restaurant while we waited. Ordered the Wrangler, the eggs and potatoes were standard quality, the pure pork sausage seemed good when hot, but as it cooled down seemed to be full of soy filler or something. The sourdough toast was good, although I suspect they use margarine, not butter on it.  There were tables outside, as we left someone was smoking there. First and last visit.

This is a local, family business, the type we find has the best food and the friendliest people.  Everything is cooked to order, so it takes a little time. No microwave in sight. I was told some of the recipes were handed down from the Grandmother., a  lot of it seems to be Guadalajara, Jalisco dishes. I like the Calamari Tacos and Lobster Enchiladas. They don't have Lobster every day, usually Friday, and only if it looks good to them. There are a few breakfast items if you go in earlier. Everything I've tried here was good, and the staff is great!] The flan is also excellent for dessert.

Dr Tran is very good and her staff are wonderful. Her office is like home. watch TV, have some cold bottled water, they have a small office set-up if you need to work while you wait. Very accommodating. They have the latest equipment, you can watch TV while they work on you if you want.

The service is very good except the coffee was a little slow to get refilled. Give them the benefit of the doubt, they may have had to make a new pot, and they were busy. Ordered the Hash with 3 eggs, it comes with biscuits and gravy. This is the gravy I've been looking for, many places can't seem to get it right. The decor was 1960's diner, booths and pictures of Marilyn, even a jukebox, but it didn't seem to be working. The coffee was Arbuckle's Ariosa, the coffee that won the West, very good. I'm tracking it down to get some for home. Roasted in Tucson.

Took my car in for coolant leak. They found the water pump was leaking and replaced it at a reasonable price. Gave me a ride home (about 2 miles). Had car ready when promised at the price promised. Very friendly folks. Would recommend them to anyone looking for a good mechanic.

Really liked the service, friendly folks who make you feel at home. Prices are very reasonable. Got the $3.99 weekday special and for $1.00 more got biscuits and gravy. The sausage was very good for a deal like this. Good food, good people.

We love this place. The Sushi is very good. The staff is very friendly. We try to go every week. Like the Hawaii Fried Rice, lots of shrimp. Lots of pictures of the food so you can see what you're getting. A real neighborhood feel. My wife wanted the Berry Roll and they were out of berries. They offered to go get some. Next time we came she remembered and told us she had berries today. It was very good.

Used to go to the YMCA and before that Pure Fitness.  Koko lets you use just one machine to do the whole work-out. No waiting for twelve machines to do it. The staff is very helpful. The machines keep track of your progress and add weight and repetitions as you get stronger. Treadmills and ellipticals for cardio. I've lost weight already in a few weeks and I'm in much better shape.

Visited aprox 5:30 PM Friday 05/20/2011. An employee was mopping the whole floor with something similar to Pine-sol. Glad we weren't trying to eat inside, gave my wife a headache. My wife's salmon was overcooked as were the Gyoza (potstickers). The salmon was supposed to come with tempura, the receipt was correct, but no tempura. We were already home when she discovered that. The Arizona Bowl was mostly white rice with a little fake(?) crab on top. If you order "to go" check the order before you leave. We will not return.

Waitress was very prompt and friendly. Service was good, food not so much. The food was was you'd expect from a chain restaurant. Probably buy white sauce in 55 gal drums. A lot of folks seemed pleased with the food, but maybe because the prices were low.

We live in the area and were pleased to see a new breakfast place opening. It seems to be a locally owned small business and we find the best food and service in this type of establishment. To borrow from William S. Burroughs writing about the Rio Grande Valley; ""In the Valley, restaurants are not operated by people who are cookers and purveyors of food. They are opened by somebody who decides that "people always eat" so a restaurant is a "good deal".""  The owners may have restaurant experience, but it's not apparent. The staff is young, and doesn't  seem to know how sit-down breakfast works. They probably grew up eating from the McDonalds drive-up window. We got coffee and placed our order, and never saw the waitress again until she was ready to give us the bill. Our coffee was gone long before the food came, someone in a black uniform (one of the owners?)  brought the food to us, but didn't see our coffee cups were empty. The waitress never came over to ask us if everything was OK. She did ask if we wanted the check when she saw our plates were empty. At that point she asked if we wanted more coffee. A quick fix would be to take the owners and waitstaff across the street to I-HOP for breakfast so they could see what they should be doing.

Love the Lobster enchiladas; not on the menu, special item usually Saturdays. The flan is excellent. Family run business, very friendly people. Recipes have been handed down for generations.

Tried this out for Restaurant Week and was very glad. Service was excellent as was the food. Had the 12 oz Sirloin and  the others tried the Salmon. Had the Canadian Bacon appetizer and it was good. We also had a half dozen Oysters which were not on the Restaurant week menu. Everything was perfect. Our waiter Jare was a real pleasure. We will be back for special occasions.

5 pm Saturday and they ran out of ribs. This kind of threw the whole experience off. We were with another couple and hungry or I'd have been for leaving right there. Ordered the Brisket sandwich on the Kids/Senior menu. Deal of the century! Sandwich wasn't that big, but it was good. Huge pile of fries and a small drink with free refills. Served on the tray covered with butcher paper. Paper plates were available. They advertised three kinds of BBQ sauce, but I only saw one bucket. "All over the place" is a good description of this establishment. It does remind me of the State Fair, including the customers. They had real hot towels to clean your hands afterward. Maybe you'll find them. No place to put the used towels, or sign to tell you what to do with them. "Leave them on the table" was the advice from the funnel cake chef. We'll probably return to try the ribs, they also have all you can eat ribs on Thursday. Some kids who came in were fascinated by the whole pig roasting on a spit.

This is the fourth incarnation of this restaurant site we have visited. This one is head and shoulders above the others. I had the $4.95 week day special 6:30 - 10:30 am. Didn't really expect much for that price, what a surprise! I ordered the sausages, which were very good quality, and the pancakes that were thick but very fluffy. The quality of the food is apparent. The coffee is organic free trade. My partner had an omelet she really enjoyed, and I tasted some of her whole wheat toast and jelly which was wonderful. We will be putting this one in the rotation.

Individual size pizza, they have a few house combos or you can pick your crust and ingredients. Dough is made on the premises. They also have salads. Great chocolate chip cookies. Very friendly staff, glad to help with your order. Fast service.

This place is closed. They could have made good money selling coffee, but they were too greedy. This is the result.

Breakfast was great. Senior Menu available with big portions. Ordered the Arizona Omelet with a biscuit.  Possibly the best biscuit I've had. Huge and fluffy. Portions were big. Food was good. Waitress was very nice. Coffee was good, but they could use one of the good Local Roasters to make a better experience. They serve real cream, not those plastic containers of questionable ingredients.
