The food is absolutely fabulous in every way! What I appreciate most, especially as a chef myself, is the consistency. Good food shouldn't depend on the chefs mood and here, it doesn't! I ALWAYS take guests there and they are pleased every time. Switch is one of the few places where, when you look at the menu, EVERYTHING looks amazing. That's key. I also frequent their weekend brunches which are a hit every time. Drinks are only $1.99 for brunches! Overall, just a fantastic dining experience.

The prices, at first glance, look decent but that's just how they pull you in. They nickel and dime you on everything else. What started as a $12 order of 20 wings turned out to be a $19 order. All we ordered was two drinks and two ranches in addition. I ordered the Garlic and Parmesan and my partner ordered the Cajun. His turned out ok, but mine were a wreck. I expected a wing sauce with garlic and parmesan. All I got was my group of wings doused in parmesan and just a light brushing of plain garlic. No sauce whatsoever. When I say soused I mean DOUSED. I had to ask for a little side of plain wing sauce to make them edible, for which they charged me 69 cents! Bottom line is this place was very disappointing when for the same price I could've gone to Little Caesars and bought three pizzas AND an order of wings. Very overrated.

Everything we tried was excellent. If you want a GREAT surprise, get the chicken lollipops. They are their version of regular wings but they're oh so different. I wasn't wild about the sliders but the chicken and grilled cheese sandwiches were amazing! The waiter accidentally made a mistake on my order, which wasn't a big deal, but he still saw to it that I got a free drink! We've been driving by for awhile and bottom line is I'm so glad we finally stopped!
