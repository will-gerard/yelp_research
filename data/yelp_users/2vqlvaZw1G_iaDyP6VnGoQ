I have been going to Sub Factory for years and years and its by far the best sub shop in arizona. Terry the owner is the Best Business owner ever and the employees there are  Great they get to know you and know what you order. They area all extremely nice. I recommend you try this location off broadway and hardy you will not be disappointed...

We have taken our dogs here since they opened and LOVE this place the STAFF is extremely friendly and My dogs don't home terrified like they do from other places. Prices are very reasonable and if you need just to have your dogs nails trimmed they do it fast and while you hold your pet.. My dogs don't bat a eyelash coming here.

I know this is kind of odd reviewing a Mortuary but I have to say Tempe Mortuary has been the most compassionate, caring place They have treated my family with such respect and love. Thank you for making this experience very easy on my family and caring for us.

My husband and I LOVE LOVE this location for some reason we feel at home at this place. The staff are very friendly and the food is amazing I love the GRITS. It's usually very busy when we come but it's worth the wait.  TRY the Kool-Aid  they have a Scottsdale location but I really don't care for that location

I've died and gone to Fajita heaven this place is amazing. You can't get enough of the Tortillas homemade and fresh  the flavors of the beef and chicken are very tasty and the SHRIMP AMAZING.. was there for a dear friends birthday and the waiters kept up on chips and drinks for us and when our food came out they made sure we had everything. It was a great experience. I love this place. Just wish there was one in the east valley

I have lived and grew up down the street from this place and never been to it.  Until one night my friend and I wanted something to eat.  Was craving a burger but not from fast food. I have to say this is hands down the best tastiest burger I've had in a long long time.  Juicy grilled right in front of you.  Omg. Just make sure you have cash they are cash only.

My husband surprised me one day taking me out to Chinese food Whe nwe arrived I was like what the heck is this place. I have lived in Tempe my whole life and never knew about this place..It has 80's decor`e but thats a given for a restaurant that has been there over 22 years who just wants to serve yummy food. Although when I am there I want to redecorate for them so so bad. BUT HANDS DOWN ITS THE BEST CHINESE FOOD AROUND...They are so friendly and attentive to your needs. Everything is good that I have ordered so far. Just writing this review makes me want to go there right now.. IT'S A MUST TRY

This place was amazing the food was so yummy and the chips and salsa amazing ..Its a casual dining place you can tell its been around for a long time and that's whats good about it. It was packed when me and my husband went but that's how it is there all the time. People love real food and a real dining experience. Its not a big place but I think its worth it even if its small spot. The enchildas are to die for.

Gene has been our family mechanic for years and years our family will not trust anyone else to do repairs on our cars. He is 100% honest and does it right the first time. Never have encountered a issue with his work. Gene's family works there and they are completely honest and friendly. I can't say one bad thing about this place and GENE..

The reason we love this airport is because it's small and friendly. Allegiant Airlines flys to small more rural areas especially from Rockford which right where we need to be rather than hassling O'hare and driving 2 hrs. I was so so happy today with the service we got when we arrived with my Grandparents who are in their late 80's who came to visit for the Holidays. There was a volunteer right there the whole time getting their baggage checked and just took them ahead of the lines so they could get them to the gate area without worries and being lost. They even sat with them the two hours they had to wait for their departure made sure they used the restroom and had water.. Its cheap air fare but the only high prices are the checked in luggage and paying for a reserved seat.. other than that KUDOS to this Airport and Airlines...

Always will love this place no matter where you go in the USA there's always a Cracker Barrel somewhere.  I always like getting the fare and fit breakfast from here the yogurt is yummy. I'm not a pancake fan but I decided to get some for the first time here and OMG to die for. The pinto beans are always my favorite at lunch or dinner.  Oh and the shopping in the lobby your always going to find the cutest stuff and some good candy.  Never had a bad customer service experience here.

I grew up on this place as well as worked there in high school the Owners are personal friends of ours and I LOVE THIS PLACE hand breaded onion rings, shrimp and all the other breaded food done fresh everyday. I am not really a seafood person but I will eat pete's and this place is legendary to Phx  fast food seafood plus the many other items they have.. I really surprised at all the negative reviews When I worked at this locations in High school I remember famous people coming through the drive thru all the time Alice Cooper loved this place.

Burger was pretty good other than a hard bun kind of hurts your jaw to chew. Butone thing that WILL NOT bring me back is a employee was putting ointment on his obviously new tattoo where people could see him and HE DID NOT WASH HIS HANDS  so gross just imagine the blood borne pathogens and skin he put on stuff. NEVER AGAIN will I be eating here.

This place has gone to pots since they have changed over to the new improved look they seem to get my orders wrong every time the food is cold and just doesn't taste like Mcdonalds food. The drive thru menu is hard to read since they changed the background to white and if you go at night prepare yourself for extremely rude employees and just over all bad service. I have been attending this location since humm I was born.. I had my birthday parties there in the 70's and 80's.. now its just not the same.. I really just have to say the food does not taste the same as it did before they changed it over to the new improved look. Although I love the look maybe its the coldness of the employees whom you can tell really don't want to work there but they have too. NEEDS EMPLOYEE Training there on how to be kind and smile

Matta's has been a family favorite since My father was a young boy. We were sad when the original location closed in mesa on main street. Then they opened up a few years later at Mesa Riverview I have to say we are happy again this has been the most favorite place that my family loves to gather at. The food is excellent the staff are very friendly and some of them are the originals from the old place. I will certainly miss going with my father when ever we say Mattas he was ready to leave the house in less then 5 minutes. My father passed away in April but we will go on and always go to mattas in honor of him. BEST CHIPS AND SALSA EVER we can't eat there without eating at least 5 bowls of chips

I'm really not a donut fan but this place makes me My husband can't resist going here every weekend to get donuts they are the BEST. Forget DDonuts ...Their donuts at bosa are so fresh and yummy.  The donuts do not lack flavor at all the cake one's especially when they have just been made melt in your mouth. A MUST TRY AT THIS LOCATION   not a fan of the phx location on Indian School

Okay this place has a odd selection of food but I guess it's to accommodate the area of the type of people who come in there. I never been to a Chinese Buffet that has enchiladas with sushi and Chinese food. over all it was good, a lot better than most buffets in phoenix. It was very clean and the waitress was very attentive to refilling your drinks. I would go back especially for the fried shrimp and some other Chinese food items..

Second time trying this place. Not pleased with the customer service.  And it's odd when a employee is sitting in the pedicure chair eating corn on the cob and sun flower seeds. Don't think I'll be returning. So far the nail salons in glendale suck.

Okay so I tried to attempt to surprise my husband by going here again after our first adventure there and did not have a pleasant experience. But once again we were disappointed we went on Feb 15th waited 45 minutes to come sit which was fine but when they called us to go sit  there was tons of seats open the nightly traffic had slowed down a bit so you could see they were not to busy especially in the section we were seated in. On to our waitress. Very unfriendly so unfriendly I can't even remember her name. It took her 15 minutes to even as us what we wanted to drink then we order the OH SO Yummy Guacamole but again it took 10 minutes to get that and she was in a hurry and added way to much lime juice but it wasn't even worth complaining about cause we never seen her around. And when ordering our food we had questions about the food and the waitress refused to even explain it was like she was in a hurry. I was very frustrated and just ended up ordering 2 taco's and my husband just a burro. We waited a very long time to even see our waitress to get our check . I don't know why we have twice now received this type of treatment from this place. I am not complaining about the food just the service treatment. Very disappointed again.

Why I tried this place a 3rd time idk... Maybe because I like their table top guacamole but not this time the girl making it didn't know how to even pit the avacodo way to much lime juice and salt. But that's not the main compliant my friend ordered the soup with pork in it. She barely could eat it. The pork tasted like it was old and over cooked.  This was her first time here I really hoped to wow her with the guacamole but no and very disappointed with the food again. Waitress acted as if she didn't care of we were not satisfied she was more into the bigger table she was serving.  Last time ever for me. Had to give 1 star doesn't even deserve a star

I can't believe the reviews on this place. We recieved big jimmys flyer in the mail so we thought we would stop by and try them out.. First off it was gross watching people cooking the pizza eating while preparing the pizza's and answering the phones  Not once did I see someone wash theirs hands and its gross to be eating while you have customers in the store watching you but they didnt seem to care.. We got home with the pizza's and bread stick  EUCKKKKKKKK the pizza was doughy  the sauce had a horrible taste to it.. My husband ended up throwing it all up we wasted a whole and half of pizza no one could eat it.. the crust had so much garlic on it you could not enjoy it at all. This place is a knock off of hungry howies which I am not a fan of but I'd rather eat howies than Big Jimmy's.. The reviews from others they must not have taste buds at all......NASTY NASTY NASTY....we were so looking forward to a good pizza but this place ruined it for us..

I had tried Gigi's in Vegas in 2010 and they were so freaking yummy. So every time we go to Vegas we would get them. In July of 2011 My fiance and I went to Vegas for what was to be our Wedding at the Chapel of bells due to some unforeseen incidents that happened Our wedding cake was not to show up :( Gigis cupcakes saved us big time with their Wedding Cake Cupcakes OMGOODNESS they were they best ever and life saving. I will always support Gigis Cupcakes. And I am so super excited that they are here in Phoenix now. instead of us trying to bring some home from the drive from Vegas we now can just share them with everyone here. We love the minis to try and share the different ones. Thank Gigis for being super good and yummy to your tummies...so much better than the competitors...

I love Nando's we drove from Glendale to this location just to have the Pollo Rico and Let me say this the food was good but The service from the time we entered til we left was horrible.  No greeting from the rude hosts who kind of threw our menus at us because we were trying to sit down and she seemed like she was in a hurry. was not busy at the time we went 3 different waiters came to our table none took the order until about 15 minutes later then the waitress checked on us once the entire hour and half we were there. The food is always delish but this time the service sucked big time.

The food was average.. But the waitress was nice but very inattentive took her awhile to check on us then she disappeared for 10 minutes. It smelt like a farm in there. I got the Stuffed potato with chili and cheese not very good. Probably not going to return due to lack of service. Took them almost 15 minutes after giving us our order to bring out the rest of the order they forgot.

OMG REAL CHICAGO FOOD FINALLY IN ARIZONA.. Got the chance to met the owner and she was the funniest person ever. Amazing Hot Dogs and THE BEEF ugh what can I say so so yummy. The salads are pretty good too. Can't wait til the one at Tempe Market Place opens closer but I will have to wait til the lines go down before I head off to that one. BUT THIS IS MUST VISIT PLACE...

This place over all is really good love the loose burgers and the coney dogs.  Never had food from Detroit nor experienced the attitude of someone from there but one compliant and the girl who works there is so rude not professional waited a minute before she or the other workers even came to the front.  I've always come in when the owner guy is working he's awesome.  But not sure if I want to come back when she's there.

Pretty cool donut place as you come in you get a order form to pick the donuts you want made fresh. Crazy good combinations of ingredients on the donuts.  Chocolate chips mint frosting to die for.  We got a dozen and they were all good. The only thing I really didn't care for was the fried taste but you get over it with different flavors. Over all good experience here.  Will be returning
