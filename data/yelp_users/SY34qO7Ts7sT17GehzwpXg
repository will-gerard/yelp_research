This was our 1st time @ Ronnie's. Great food & BIG portions. If you're looking for home style food, this is the place.  The staff was awesome too - friendly & informative.

My regular nail spot.  Great for kids too but get a polish change for them only if your trying to save $.

Much prefer Ramiros!  Two times they have messed up my order.  :-(  This time, I order a side of rice (from 'sides' on the menu) & got a micro-side...like 2 tblspn.  Seriously!  They just don't seem to pay attention.

Always accommodating & friendly.  We bring our kids & they love it too.  If you prefer lo-carb, order the Lollipop Roll - Yum! Great, fresh food!

Nice staff but completely unwhelmed by the food.  For the prices, the food was very "eh".  This was a first & last visit for us.

I completely take back my previous review. Haymaker is definitely a good place. Our breakfast was fantastic & the staff was good. I also LOVE how Haymaker gives back to their employees  (they're holding a benefit  night to help one of them out)  Visit the Haymaker - you will enjoy the laid back, comfortable atmosphere & delish food.

Authentic!   The shrimp rancheras is awesome,  salsa rocks & servers are fabulous.   Definitely coming back.
