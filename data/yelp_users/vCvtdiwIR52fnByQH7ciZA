So far this had been the best CB I have been to. The wait is shorter than the one on bell and 101. I love the cheesy hashbrown casserole and it is highly recommended. It is always pretty loud in CB, but is still enjoyable. I love to go Sundays after or before church.

I am a regular here. Everytime I have been here the service has been wonderful. All of the employees are friendly. Chris and Jerrod are hard workers. The 2 for $20 deal is awesome. Become a rewards member to earn free dinners!! Highly recommended.

I used to work here so it had to be good;) Honestly, I would say it is the most friendly place I had been to. Cashiers are willing to except all coupons and work with their customers. The prices are great and the gas rewards system is very useful. I just wish it was a Marketplace instead.

Not a good experience......The people working at customer service acted like we didn't exist and acted like their job was sooo hard. All I wanted to do was exchnage some ink cartridges for some coupons. I was new to this myslef and they expected me to know everything about it. I will not be coming back to this location.

Lines are still very long and slow here even after 9pm. Shelves are not stocked, and the water I buy is never on shelf.

This is one of my favorite VS they always have more selection than arrowhead. It is also less crowded and is more spacious . I love the pink section :)

Ryan usually is our server! I love the chips and salsa and queso dip. It is not too expensive. There is never a wait and it is always clean.

I love the SSB (soup salad breadsticks). You can for sure share the dinners it is enough for 2. Sometimes the lobby smells a little odd, but other than that, the service is great as well as the food!

This is open 24 hours which is perfect for people with busy schedules. There is a private aerobics room with mats and other equipment. You can really get a full body workout here with all the free weights and machines. Wifi is also available.

BDUBs used to be one of my favorite places to go, especially on Tuesday nights with my boyfriend. But recently, service has been slow and prices have gone up. Even though the wings are now "bigger" I am not sure if it is worth the extra 20 cents they added without telling us. I'd rather go somewhere else.

This place is super cute and relaxing. Prices are not too bad during happy hour and the food is tasty. I love to go here with a group of girls and just talk. There are many nice chairs and couches to just hang out on. The waitresses are very socialable and do not rush you. It can be quite crowded when an event is being help. This could be the place for a blind date if you are single and ready to mingle.

I really like the cake batter, and cookies and cream. Staff could have been more friendly though. Not the same as Yogurtology.

Many great items you wouldn't think would be $1. I love going here for school supplies. They have many posters, books, activities, notebooks etc that I use for my classroom. Perfect for teachers who don't like to spend lots of money at the teacher stores.
