I used Yelp to pick a restaurant to go to lunch with my mom.  I should've paid closer attention to the bad reviews.  One word: yuck. The dish that we had was void of flavor.  Even adding a sh*t ton of spicy mustard couldn't help save it.  We sat at our table for 20 minutes before I went to the front to find out why no one had come to take our order.   I will never go back there and I would advise others to avoid this place.

So.Bad. If I could give them negative 5 stars, I would.   I will never go back there, nor will I recommend them to anyone I care about. Here are some facts about my experiences there:  The front office is fine - a little plain, but fine.  The exam rooms, however, are ganky. I have seen broken wire, gauze, and other trash on the floor.  It feels old and dirty.  The dentists are very unprofessional.  For example, my most recent dentist was talking about me with another patient and then sighed impatiently before he came back into see me.    The work that is being done by the dentists feels rushed and it isn't the best quality either.   My husband ended up going back 5 times to get something redone because it wasn't done properly in the first place.   Another experience is that I had a root canal (which I paid $500 for out of pocket) and the dentist did not seal it correctly and now I have to get that tooth pulled.  One dentist I had was in a rush.  He stabbed the needle into my mouth so hard that my jaw is swollen two weeks after I went.  He didn't want to have to wait for the anesthesia to kick in, so he sent me away (numb) and wanted me to make an appointment where they could put me under.  What???  I found a new dentist, who is amazing.  Do yourself a favor - save time and frustration and stay away from this place.

Great!  Very friendly, super clean and very relaxing environment.  Wendy did my gel manicure and I am very happy with the way they turned out.  I will definitely be back.

This place rocks!  Everything at Gala Nails is perfect.  I have been in several times, to a few different techs, and they all have the same incredibly high standard.  They spend the time to make sure your service is just right.  The facility is pretty and very clean.  They always have some sort of good music on and it isn't too loud (but loud enough to sing along, if you want).   I will keep coming back and telling everyone I know to come here.

This review is mostly about the actual event and the organizers.  We purchased the VIP package and were extremely disappointed.  Here's what we found:   There were *maybe* a 1/3 of the number of trucks promised.  Not all of the trucks offered samples, which is why your purchase tickets in the first place. The lines were crazy long and no one honored the VIP wristbands.   Probably 1/2 of the trucks that did offer samples "ran out" a few hours into the festival.   When you buy a VIP package, you get a drink ticket used to get a can of soda or a bottle of water.  They are not chilled and, because they have been sitting in the sun, are actually warm.   The whole thing was completely unorganized.    I have heard that the Cave Creek festival is much better and will go there next year for sure.  Save your time and money - stay away from this event.
