Superior service from reception to the service tech Sean (sp?). You can't beat the spring time rate of $110.00 people! I was shocked at the amount of soot that fell out!  This company fit me in right away, the tech called me a half hour before his prompt arrival, and deftly set up and cleaned out the chimney in a snap. Five stars for a company this impressive!

Let me just say I was highly disappointed.  3:00 on a Friday (no Happy Hour btw) and the place was empty besides two strange people practically doing it in the bar.  The waiter/bartender, WOW.  He's one of those guys who looks like he just rolled out of bed, superficially overly-nice but really doesn't give a crap.  After seating us, he decided it would be a good time to bus some tables instead of getting us a drink.  Then he decided it would be a good idea to mess around with the television, again, BEFORE asking us if we wanted a drink or even water. Finally we got a Corona with an old lime and ordered. We asked for a side of sour cream to go with the HOT salsa that they are so proud of, BEFORE our late lunch arrival.  He takes our order and poof, disappears for about ten minutes (I suspect he might have also been the cook) He comes sauntering out with our plates in a snap and exclaims "Oh, isn't this plate beautiful?!?" and then gives us the side of sour cream that was supposed to come out first. My girlfriend had a bean burrito enchilada style and said it was pretty good, I have one more good thing to say before I shred this place to bits.  The sour cream is the star of everything.  It really is wonderful.  I don't know what they do to it (probably piss in it) but it is tasty.  I had the most god-aweful taco salad (ground beef).  Not only was the plating lacking, so was the lettuce and vegetables, practically non-existent.  The meat was very salty and that's all you get on a little pile of pinto beans. Disgusting. DO NOT SUPPORT OVER-RATED PLACES WHO DO NOT GIVE A #$%^! !

Wow! I needed a few electrical items fixed on a Binzer for a house I am selling, and I needed it done fast. Michelle came out THE SAME DAY and rocked out the items for me in a professional manner with very competitive pricing! HIGHLY recommend!

First of all, we knew it was going to be good when we drove up and noticed the great smells from the parking lot! Let's start with the building and decor. Urban hip all the way, clean with a great vibe. I noticed and loved all of the recycled materials used so creatively in the decor. You can tell there are smart and creative people behind this business and it shows.  My girlfriend has been a vegetarian for 30+ years and while I am not, I do all of the cooking in our house and have developed an appreciation for this type of cuisine and am always looking for creative ways to spice up our meals. Most of the meat substitutes found in stores do not measure up to whatever they used as chicken-less chicken in their spicy buffalo wings. They were so flavorful, had a great meat texture, and the ranch dressing to cool it all off was delish. I can't wait to have them again! We then tried the Green Hummus. Again, very flavorful, the green part coming from a creative use of Poblano Peppers and drizzled with a little sesame oil. I thought the pita chips were a little greasy and since I try not to eat fried foods very much, I thought it would be cool if they offered and un-fried option but they don't. Then again, I didn't ask. Whatever they used to season the chips with was also very good and very flavorful. We then embarked upon the crabless-puffs. Nothing remarkable but for a creamy fried (Ughh) little puff, it was great. The "Green" salad was kind of blah compared to everything else we had, but it was fresh and organic and made me feel better about myself after munching down all the fried stuff. The service was super fast and friendly. I thought the pricing was dead-nuts. Even the bathrooms were cool! We can't wait to go back and try more things! We have a great appreciation for restaurateurs who actually pay attention to detail and take the time to develop a creative and super flavorful menu like this. Worth the drive, worth the money, worth our time = Five star review.

RED FLAG, RED FLAG, RED FLAG!  I wish I could give this place a quarter star! None of the food is restaurant quality! Frozen broccoli, re-heated potatoes that were cold in the middle and the "Mystic Cheesesteak" was rubbery and also re-heated somehow.  Maybe that's the mystic part. My girlfriend had the vegetarian kamut pasta, also sprinkled with frozen vegetables and BLAND as bland can be. Our choice of red or white wine was red and it came ice cold! The menu is bizarre and third gradish stemming from the owner who clearly does not give a crap and doesn't know what the hell he is doing. Hopefully by the time you read this they will be out of business and I will have saved you $$$. The server was nice and as sweet as could be but gives you the most bizarre excuses for everything.  Were it not for her and my girlfriend not wanting me to make a scene, we would have walked out.  Please trust me when I tell you that I do know what I am talking about and if you go with the five star reviews don't say I didn't try to tell you.

Wow! I don't normally give 5 stars but I was really impressed with this salad! I had the saganaki with gyro; super fresh greens, garbanzo beans, kalamata olives, radishes served with warm and fluffy pita bread... Mmmmmmmmn!!!  Really delicious. I don't know why it took me so long to try this place as I live in this neighborhood, but I'm sure glad I did!
