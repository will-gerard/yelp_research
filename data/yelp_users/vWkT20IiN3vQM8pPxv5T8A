I love this place! I started going here because I was given some free car wash vouchers. The guys that work here are so friendly. I always feel like I get the VIP treatment even though I'm just sitting in my car and vacuuming my own car. I have even had the guys give me a free windshield out of the vending machine when another guys got stuck and last time j was there he asked if I needed more time on the vacuum. Last time I was there I even literally almost ran into two of the owners (at least I think they were the owners). They were also super friendly and made sure I had everything I needed. I mean it's no glamorous car wash so if you are lazy and want it all done for you then this isn't your place but if you are just needing a car wash and don't mind vacuuming yourself and wiping down the inside of your car this is the place! Remember to tip the guys for all their hard work. Thanks Weiss Guys!

Beware... They pretty much require you to have an appointment to be seen here. I stumbled upon this salon a while back and they did a great job on my toes. Recently I moved to the area and needed a new salon to naturally I went here because I had a good experience. My toes chipped within days. The next time I went back on a Thursday in the middle of the day, they claimed they couldn't even fit me in for a pedicure because they were booked the rest of the day. There was nobody waiting and only 4-5 people getting their nails done. I asked the front lady "so you guys are basically appointments only?" And she said yes but if there is time we take walk ins. I find it hard to believe that at 1pm on a Thursday they are booked solid for the rest of the day. Definitely rubbed me the wrong way and did not feel like they cared at all.

I went to this place for the first time today and they are awesome! The staff is very nice and I didn't have to wait at all. Not to mention that have a bazillion gel colors to choose from (sorted out by brand, which someone OCD like me can appreciate). Also a wall full of regular polish to choose from.  Lee did my gel manicure and she's great. She took her time and made sure they were perfect and even asked me if I wanted a 3rd coat instead of assuming or disregarding it. She made certain that they were done how I wanted them to be done, rather than how the nail tech thinks they should be done. I am very picky with my nails, but I was a very happy customer walking out of there today. She actually did them square, which most don't. This is a second location from the original salon on Scottsdale. They just opened about 6 months ago. I would recommend them! Oh and prices are great. $25 for gel and no charge to take off current gel.

It seems like recently in the last 6 months or so Juicd Life has been out of stock of their produce to make their "made to order" juices. There's always an excuse that their shipment is late or hasn't come in yet. I really don't understand how is this an acceptable way to even open your store for the day. Go to the Fry's down the street to get produce to hold you over. They've lost my business since True Food is a hop skip and a jump away. Won't even waste my time on Juicd Life anymore.
