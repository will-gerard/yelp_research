Aaah, the familiar blast of air conditioning fans my face as we walked out of the gate from the plane...   Why is it that just one to two days before arriving in Arizona, it was 60 degrees?--the same degree of coolness as the bay, but when we touched Phoenix ground, it's all of a sudden 90 degrees??  And of course, when we leave next week, the temp will plummet back down (at least, according to the news).  The Gods have it in store for my fiance and I to somehow *enjoy* the heat as we visit friends and family twice a year in Mesa.  Anyway, back to the airport..there was this lady parked on the loading zone for 15 minutes waiting for her party.  WTF??  In Oakland, they'll sic the security on you when you so as much touch the curb for 30 seconds without picking or dropping off someone.  I once nearly got into a car accident trying to avoid their palms from hitting my trunk..

By far, way better service than the ones in the Bay Area!  Our waiter, Rachel, was very warm and friendly, and anticipated all of our needs...from drink refills to when our entrees will be ready ("just a few more minutes"), she was never late with anything.  And if you're on a health kick / lifestyle change like me, order the Linguini Marinara.  Even the version with whole wheat noodles was deliciosoo!!

After our flight into Mesa, our friends decided to grab a quick lunch to go from Arby's.  I chose the specialty on the flyer found at a my friend's house--a pastrami sandwich with curly fries.  Nothing beats hunger from: 1. Waking up at 5 a.m.,  2. Being holed up in a plane for nearly 2 hours with LOUD, obnoxious baseball fans coming to watch Spring Training,  3. And being blasted by 90-degree weather at 10:30 a.m.  ..Except, of course, pastrami on rye, with melted cheese on sauerkraut with a handful of curly fries, Diet Dr. Pepper, and Jalapeno poppers with raspberry sauce!  I must say, this is some good junk food, my friends, good junk food!!

Spacious, comfortable seats, and cheaper than the movies in CA....it was the perfect spot to watch "300" (which also gets a 5 star in my book).

Mmmmm, their mongolian beef one is really good.  Tender meat, perfectly salted peanuts amongst flavorful noodles!!  Can't wait to try this again!!!

This store has a very organized layout--it was easy to find the different sections!  Their prices are very comparable to Best Buy and other electronics stores.  Some DVDs weren't labeled right though...which isn't necessarily a bad thing considering they were cheaper than was what stated.  Check out was fast--they have so many cashiers and one guy whose only job was to tell the customers which checker was free.

for now, it's my most fave hotel to shop in!  from louis vuitton to dior, it is like a disneyland for adults as sue u. said (see previous yelper).  i love the main floor, where balls of colorful flowers hang like xmas ornaments on trees.  too bad it was too crowded to take a picture where the trees formed an arch.  the floor was also very beautiful, marble but decorated with lovely tiles!!

just from a "tourist"'s point of view...this is one of the hotels i love visiting in vegas.  their decor is amazing...from the realistic sky to the backdrop of italian boutiques.  it was photo galore!!  i definitely took many pics here.  next time, i'll stay here and maybe try the gondola ride--it looks ultra romantico!!

Decor is a big thing for me!  Enter the circular hallway to find a sensual collection of tubs filled with orchids and candles floating on water---very upscale.  The main room is filled with buddhas and other zen-like motif.  Very relaxing.  The bartender / security weren't very friendly though.

Compared to other TGI Fridays, this one has the best decorations.  When you enter, you see a gigantic poster on a wall full of wacky and artistically placed quotes.    I forgot to mention that some of the staff were outside greeting guests, which was very welcoming.  They also had awesome teamwork when another waiter served our drinks.  Our main waiter was rather slow and just friendly enough, but to her defense she was pregnant.  The Zen chicken potstickers hit the spot.  It was neither too greasy or "too American" (considering this wasn't a Chinese restaurant).  I loved the mixture of spices in the chicken topped off with the soy sauce dip.  Order a Mai Tai for a truly fruity, yummy drink.  Another friend ordered the Lava Flow, and we swore we felt like these drinks were from Hawaii!!  Mmm, mmm, good!!

As far as Buffets in Vegas, they say this is the best.  So I had to check it out for myself.  Surprisingly, even if you're trying to watch what you eat like i am (and I went to a buffet?), you can find many options.  I give it a 4 stars rating because of the crab!  Delicious!  And definitely we got our money's worth!    I also like the hazelnut italian ice cream and the dim sum was heavenly!!  Hey, if i'm gonna cheat on my diet, i might as well go all out!!

The only reason I gave this more than a one star was because of the bouncer who let us in--some of the guys had sneakers on.  I guess it does have eclectic decor, like the website said...and the dancers were fun to watch.  What negates these good points were 1) the waitress was soo slow, we waited 15 minutes for our order and she still didn't get to us.  2) the crowd was a little older than what we wanted.  3) it was very small, therefore, very packed on a Saturday nite.  4) their damn stamp on my hand was a bitch to take off.  Too bad the Pussycat Lounge was too crowded....

People can make fun of Mesa all they want.  I know I did.  I mean, it's out in the boondocks.  Try driving the 12-14 hours it takes from the Bay Area, and all you'll see in the last 5 hours is a stretch of dessert.  But I have to hand it to them...they have a freakin' Super Walmart!!  Equipped with enough warehouse room to house a grocery store AND its own Self Check-out station.  Fiance and I bought all we need on this trip--eggs and little Smokies to cook for breakfast, Hair conditioner, Jodi Picoult's new bestseller for some reading time, and Decithin diaper cream for our new nephew!  But, dude, I was the only Asian in the whole store!!
