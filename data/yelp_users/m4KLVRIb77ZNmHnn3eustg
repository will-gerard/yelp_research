I love this restaurant for when I crave soupy Japanese noodles. My favorite  dishes are the Ika Mentai, hot udon and champon. However..... this review is about their fruit cream cake my boyfriend  and I had about 2 weeks ago. I am not usually the dessert type  but we decided to "go all out" and order dessert and we were NOT disappointed. I am not sure if their desserts change daily but all I can say is that I dream about this cake. It is not  too sweet, is moist and has fresh oranges, kiwi, strawberries, etc.

I love the atmosphere, coffee, and food at Lux. My friend got the mac n' cheese and loved it. I usually go for the iced coffee which never disappoints. It's always pretty packed though so I wouldn't recommend going for a quiet study session.

Sushi  Ken is wonderful. I have been here numerous times and have never been disappointed. The most recent was when I brought my parents who were visiting from out of town and they loved it! Sushi and sashimi are always fresh and their combo deals are great. I think they have great ramen and have also heard good things about their chirashi bowls (Korean or Japanese style ).

The coffee is great but the real winner are the scones at Urban Beans. Most scones I have tasted from coffee shops are dry and a bit chalky but Urban Beans has perfected the art of the "scone". They are moist and savory yet sweet. My favorite is the pear, brie(?) or gorgonzola (?) I highly recommend it for a quick on the go treat.

I went to Greenfield Nails & Spa after seeing that it had the highest and most ratings on Yelp for a nail salon in the Gilbert area. There is a reason why this place is rated so high! My mom owned a nail salon back in Denver and I have pretty high standards when it comes to cleanliness and quality of technicians and Greenfield had both. Kathy worked on my nails and was very meticulous and thorough. I recommend this nail salon to anyone who is in the GIlbert area... and to anyone willing to make the drive to one of the best nail salons in the Valley.

Mmmm. I went here for dinner with a few of my girlfriends and we all enjoyed the ambience and the food. They are labeled as a "Modern Italian" restaurant  and serve food that is very unique and different from other Italian joints.  Food was served family style so we got to try a variety of dishes. My favorite was the squid ink risotto and the raw albacore dish. Since it was a girls' night, we all had their cocktails which were all delicious as well. I highly recommend this restaurant if you are looking for a place to take a romantic date or just a night out with friends.

After calling many moving companies for a local move from Gilbert to Phoenix, Moveaholics was the last company I called and their price and Yelp reviews were hard to beat. Most of the moving companies were charging an average of $350 for the move (2 hour minimum labor and additional trip charge etc). Moveaholics gave me a quote of $175 for a 2 hour, 2 men move including a trailer!! I have not found any other company that can beat this price.  Punctuality:  They called me and were right on time. They got to work right away. The trailer: I was concerned with how a trailer was going to both fit all my stuff and get all my stuff safely but the guys were DEFINITELY pros at wrapping all my furniture and making sure all my belongings were safely secured.  Overall, the move took 2.5 hours total which included the 30 minute drive from my old place to the new apartment.  The ONLY complaint I can give is that once it came time to pay, they had forgotten to pack the square for the credit card and had to wait about 20 minutes for the problem to be resolved. Not a big deal....  I definitely would recommend Moveaholics and use them for my next move.

This family owned Korean restaurant  has, in my opinion, the best Korean food in the Valley. Great menu choices, generous portions and tasty food. Service can be a little slow but I think that they have worked out some of the kinks and I do see improvement in this area. I am definitely a regular at this establishment and will recommend to anyone looking for decent Korean food.

The broths are so delicious and the add-ins are always fresh. We had the spicy broth and the house herbal broth. The broths are so good by themselves and somehow get even better by the end of the meal after  all the add ins simmer and marinate in the soup. I also don't  feel guilty after eating at Shabu Fondue because  the broth is not greasy and the ingredients are fresh. There were a lot of new customers around us and they all seemed very satisfied with their meal. If you have never tried hot pot, you need to try it now... at Shabu Fondue.

Oh Otakumen. I had such high hopes for this place. The people working were not rude, nor overly enthusiastic. Their morale seemed to be deflated, maybe from reading yelp reviews. Either way, I went to Otakumen having not read the yelp reviews. I had wanted to try this place on opening day and had my Top Ramen in hand, only to find out that they had sold out. Understandable. Tried to go a week after only to see the store was closed. Ok. Let them work out the kinks, they're a brand new establishment. So yesterday, I decided to try this place out. There was one other table seated and a couple more parties came in while we were there. Then while I was waiting for the ramen I opened up yelp and got worried. My fears were confirmed as I went up to get the ramen. I got the shio tonkotsu and my boyfriend got the miso. Both were incredibly oily, and there was absolutely no flavor in the broths. How can there be so many ingredients and no flavor? I am not an expert on noodles so I won't comment on their quality. I'll just state that there were 2 different kinds. The temperature of the ramen was also on the warm to luke warm side which to some might aid in speed of consumption but I like it steaming hot. Anyways, I  was disappointed. Hope they read their reviews and improve because I want them to succeed.
