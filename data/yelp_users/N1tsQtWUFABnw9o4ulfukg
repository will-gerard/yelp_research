Great authentic Mexican food! Jalisco style. I had the tacos with rice and beans. 2 pastor tacos and 1 carne asada. I liked the carne asada better but both were VERY good. They serve both salsa verde and salas rojo. Very reasonable prices... Wish this place was close to home!!

Rules. Rules. And more Rules!  No cell phones. No incomplete parties. No credit cards. (cash only) No firearms. No outside drinks allowed in. No to go orders on weekends & holidays. No smoking. (which is a city law) So if you can handle all of this, the food is pretty good. oh yeah... btw.. if you would like to try the blueberry syrup then be prepared to pay $1.75 for a 2 Tbsp. serving of smashed blueberries mixed with pancake syrup... They didn't tell me it was extra and I found it quite disappointing to pay so much for so little.

Good beer.. That's about it!  Had wings for an appetizer... Pretty good.. But too tangy for my liking and not spicy enough even when ordered HOT.  I had chef salad.. Who can't make a decent chef salad? Blue cheese dressing wasn't the best by any means. The chicken strips and fries were actually pretty good!  They were out of the beef wellington... So my boyfriend ordered the filet... What a joke! Sauce was horrible and the steak didn't have a great flavor! Service was horrible.. One girl took our drink order and another one took our food order who was brand new and didn't have a clue.. And another girl checked in a couple of times who seemed to have been training the other girl...the bartender dropped our food and replenished our drinks.. R u confused yet? Because that was exactly how our experience was.. Should have went to chili's!

We orginally set out in search of another bbq place but it was closed so we ended up at Bobby Q!  Thinking it was going to be a chain-style restaurant.  Boy, were we wrong!  The building and atmosphere was true to the BBQ tradition.  SUNDAYS at Bobby Q!!  $28 got us a family feast of Smoked Chicken, Smoked Brisket, Smoked Ribs(St. Louis style), Smoked Pulled Pork, 2 sides (We chose Mac & Cheese, Mashed Potatoes), Cornbread.  The cornbread was slightly sweet, buttery and very moist!  All the meat was very tender.. but I am partial to brisket which really impressed me the most...  My boyfriend loves ribs and said on the ride home that they are better than his favorite.  The spicy BBQ sauce was a little too tangy for me and needed more kick.  The server Jon was very informative about the menu and knowledgable about BBQ.   We left very full and happy with alot of food to take home!  It was worth the drive across town!

This is a great "scene" but the food was not that great... I had the filet and it was not  very tender and didnt have great flavor... but the wings were great... I think the apps are better than the dinner menu!   The patio rocks!!

What a great neighborhood family owned place!!  The spring rolls are very fresh and delicious.  The Pho is amazing...when i am sick it always makes me feel better.  I get brisket only Pho :)  The brisket is a little more tasty than sirloin.  The pork fried rice is tasty! and healthy portions!  Tamarind soda is nice quench thirster... if you have never had it or heard of it... its a must!  The service is a little relaxed but very courteous and nice.   Only downfall is they do not serve alcohol and they close a little early...8:30pm.

A client had referred me to this place.  I orginally thought it was a casual place but when we arrived our expectations rose but was let down by the whole experience.   Every dish we ordered tasted like we were licking a salt block... we could hardly eat our entrees. When we told our server he did nothing about it.  No manager came to see us, we got no new entrees.  But instead they brought out a chocolate dessert.  We didnt want dessert.  We wanted a meal that was edible.  Overall poor customer service and horrible food especially for the price.  If I was eating at Houston's they would have sent over a manager and sent out new entrees.  Now that is a level of service!  In fact I talked some friends out of going there for their annv. and I myself will never return there.

Very friendly staff... I had a Mai Tai.. which was very good.. sometimes they are too sweet but this one was perfect!  For appetizers we ordered the ahi sashimi and spicy seaweed salad.  The salad had a nice kick and the ahi was awesome.. so good we had another order of it.  It was better than any I have had at a sushi place recently.   For dinner we had the butterfish pan fried with a mushroom sauce, rice and subsituted sauteed spinach for slaw.... very yummy and not over cooked.... also had the ribs.. pretty good too.   The patio had a nice atmosphere and misters :) Great experience all the way around.

Price was def reasonable!  Food -- great quality!  Not just a typical burger!  Nice bar with plenty of TVs. Scalloped potatoes were awesome!  Michael, the bartender bought us the doughnuts!! Very nice sweet treat to end our experience!  We will be back!

Pool Daddy came highly recommended from a friend... I am so thankful I called him! Our pool was green (beyond green..lol) and he got it straightened out quick!  It's great to be able to trust someone with the pool!  I won't be doing the maintenance myself anymore.. It's so worth having someone who knows what they are doing! Thanks again Pool Daddy!

Ventured down to Old Town for Sunday Breakfast only to be disappointed!  It's the middle of summer in the desert and like fools we agreed to sit on the patio as it was packed and hoping it wouldn't be miserable.. Given that I am almost 7 months pregnant we had to be asked to move inside mid-way! The hostess handled our situation with a pleasant grace and our original server was very sweet about the change.  When our food arrived they forgot my husbands toast and then he realized that his omelette was not the one he ordered.  So I are without him and then waited for him to eat once his correct omelette came. He also had ordered hash browns but got country potatoes. Both of our egg dishes needed seasoning.. All in all it was pretty bland breakfast.  I highly doubt we will ever return!

Dr A revised my daughters tongue tie when she was a week old. It made breastfeeding work for us! If we wouldn't have done it I know I would have not been able to breastfeed! I am a first time mom and I was super emotional about it. Dr. A gave us all the necessary information along with emotional support. I love that he is very passionate about the importance of breastfeeding as long as possible!

The ultimate experience.. From the minute we walked in.. Greeted by Vanessa who had a friendly upbeat attitude.. Seated and served promptly with ice water, chips & salsa! Exactly what you want when it's 109 degrees outside on a Saturday. She told us about their $5 drink happy hour- we were IN! Serrano Cucumber Margarita, blood orange margarita, pineapple mojito, & high roller marg! All the drinks were outstanding!!! We had a cup of the tortilla soup and added a spoon full of salsa.. So delish! We each had the 3 tacos with a side.. All of our tacos were fabulous! My husband is mexican and he was even impressed!! So you know it's good!! The service was top notch!!! On point, period!  All in all --- a Hip Mexican joint with Great food!!!  Cannot wait to go back!!
