This place has just gone down hill, we keep going back in hopes the "traditional Macayos" is back.... No such luck. Drinks took 20min, fish taco was burnt and came out 10min after the rest of the meals. Lots of items forgotten on the dishes we ordered. The manager didn't seem to be concerned at all. The food is just not good. I would suggest Rio Mirage if your looking for good Mexican food in Surprise.

Very slow service, was not busy at all. I eat sushi 4-5 month all over the valley and country, this was probably the worst.  Rice tasted days all and hard, and tuna & spicy tuna had NO flavor. If you like Sauce.. They Drown rolls.  $90 and first time ever we didn't clean the plate!

New owners took over-- sushi went downhill-- hibachi grills are same good food. But I do not recommend their sushi

My husband loves the salmon- the house grilled chicken is good too. There's not a lot on menu for GF-- I tried the curry chicken/rice bowl-- flavor was amazing, but the chicken, peas and carrots where all previously frozen. Don't understand why!?! If this dish was made with their house chicken and fresh peas and carrots it would be amazing!!
