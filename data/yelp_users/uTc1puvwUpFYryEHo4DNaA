Noon and I'm starving!   hadn't eaten since the night before... i could feel my stomach slowly eating itself! after picking up some stuff on my way back to work i saw Blimpies... as usual... seen it a million times but never stopped in.   there were a few folks inside... looked cozy enough..   the lady behind the counter wasn't very social... just what do you want.. and that was it... :(   i had a toasted 6in with roast beef/ turkey/ cheddar...  They didn't have very many veggies to choose from..... not even pickles...   for some reason the sandwich was really small and was not filling at all... i was still hungry...   It left me wishing i had chosen subway instead...   and just for that dinky sub i spent $4.75...   Not worth it in my book...

Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm........................   Just thinking about this place makes my mouth water!!!   The Atmosphere just puts me in another time ... the interior/exterior.... the staffing attire... the music.... uh its great...   the service is nice... they are very nice, out going and attentive... but give you your space... its perfect....   the food was awesome!!! i had a burger... OMG i couldn't even finish it, it almost felt criminal...it was sooo good! and their fries are yummy too...  i have this insane obsession of eating almost everything with BBQ sauce and usually i would pass on ordering it in most places because... well it always tastes funny or really watery... but in case you looove BBQ sauce to... it was great! lol   The pricing on their menu is a pricier than Denny's.... but not by much, and the shake up in our reg Dennys routine is defiantly worth it :)

Mmmmmm   My roommate and i showed up around 8pm.... it was pretty busy....  but we were seated right away.. and our waitress.. Barbie Doll (according to her name tag) was so nice!   my roommate had a pumpkin shake... AMAZING!!!! also had the biscuits and gravy with eggs and bacon... she didn't like it all to much.. (shes a very picky eater) the B&G would have tasted better to me if they didn't put paprika over if...   I had their Hound Dog... a pretty nice sized hot dog, the bun toasted... and you could add on chili, cheese or sour kraut!!! I had extra sour kraut and mustard on it! :) mmmm hit the spot... and their Fri's are sooo yummy!! and their BBQ sauce is super good too :)   we both decided to have a slice of their cheesecake.... I had strawberry topping.. it was alright.. i wish they had had cherry toppings... mmm.. but this cheesecake was amazing!!!!!!!!! so creamy and a really nice sized piece ... i cannot wait to have it again!! :)   Barbie Doll was very attentive and helpful... no where near annoying... at all!! i loved it... and all the other waiters that passed by were lovely as well.. all smiles.. but not the fake kinds... i liked it..

The Employees were very cheerful and up beat... but not in that annoying cavity in your tooth sweet....  the store is very clean and organized...   The dog toys are always having some kind of sale :) which makes my little ones very happy :)   and it has a benefield (vet) inside... i had to take my pups their once or twice... the vets are very kind, knowledgeable and patient!  and the pricing for care isn't half bad.   I would recommend this location! :)

Thank You Amy D.   If it were not for her, i would not have brought in the new year the best way i now know how to...   by doing YOGA! :)   the lady at the front desk was amazing ... she was very calm and welcoming... that made me feel more comfortable since i don't ever go anywhere alone... and i had never done yoga ever in my life... two new things in one night... I'm on a roll :)   i met Amy D.... she is so nice and welcoming too :) it made things way easier...   the instructor was a very nice gentleman... tall with a little ponytail... and an adorable little white chihuahua that stays up at the front of the studio in his kennel during the session.. :) i thought it was cute lol   the instructor had such a calming voice and was very easy to follow...   meditation is NOT my forte... even though it was relaxing and interesting... i guess i need more practice since half the time i had my eyes open (yes, i had my eyes open during meditation... i know now ... that's a no-no) and was watching everyone else to see what i was doing wrong.. why i couldn't just relax and think about nothing... hmm.. yes definitely need more practice...   the bathrooms were very spacious and clean... and i loved the little cubby holes for your shoes and things :)   the studio was very calming and clean... and clean makes me calm... lots of space.. and the dimming light action seriously helped in the mood setting...   this has been one of the best "new" experiences Ive had yet this year... and i cannot wait for more...   Thanks Again Amy...

i have ordered To-Go... alot! and ate in... i love it!!  its a little red house.. you cant miss it... I'm pretty sure its family run... and its a cozy little place... the sweet and sour chicken/pork is great!!   i always go for their lunch specials.. its no more than about $7 total...  and you get a lot of food!! you get their soup ... then the entree!  i always get their sweet and sour chicken or pork... a nice sized helping of egg fried rice.. chicken and bell peppers, big chunks of pineapple, onions in just the right amount of S&S sauce... a spring roll... its sooo good... and these little fried won tons.. so yummy...   if you get take out.. you get all of it but the soup.. but that's alright :) when you get take out you always get more food stacked in the box :) yum!   this is a great lunch spot down town :) its a hidden treasure...

SO after working all day... then going to school.. first english...and then a TWO HOUR MATH class... i start craving some horchata like no other!! the entire drive home all i could think of was that luscious creamy rice milk.... mmmmm.....   i get home and its 930pm already.... we don't go out much... so we kinda drove around until we found a Mexican food restaurant that was open and pulled in... there were still a few people inside so were thought SCORE!!!! we walk in and the guy at the cashier was super nice... he seated us...   i of course ran to the ladies room... mmmm i give it a 3..... its didn't smell to pleasant.... and yes i do expect a bathroom to smell good... you don't wanna your customers to loose their appetites right??   by the time i got back we already had our drinks and some chips and salsa i love so much! right away i order some horchata!!! but they freeze theirs.... i never had it like that before... but it was good : )   I Got a beef Tostada... oh it was shredded beef.. and they were very generous : ) and my roommate got a Quesadilla it was the size of a med pizza!! it looked sooo yummy!!....   the service was supper speedy but our waiter seemed a little irritated... and then the bar turned off its lights... lol we were those annoying people that come in 5 minutes before closing!!!! i felt soooo bad!!! especially after hearing tid bits of what the other employees were saying to our waiter before they left.... (they were speaking Spanish... i know very little)   we tried to eat as quick as possible... the cashier guy came over and finished being our Waiter... he was so nice... they closed at 10pm we were done and out by 10:08..... i don't think I've ever only spent 18 minutes in a sit down Restaurant before! lol   ahhhh the things we do for our horchata cravings....

Last Time i visited this place i dropped in my business card (finally a good use for them lol) and with in that next week i got a coupon in the mail for a free meal! HEYA!!! I have been itching to use it for days!!   The best part is that it is only a block or so away from my school, class gets out right before 9... and it closes at 10... just enough time...  math makes me crave Mexican, i cant help myself....   last night i had the shredded beef burrito with cheese and sour cream inside... and beans on the side... i was in heaven!!!  Their beef is soooo goooodddd!!!!   i think they are starting to recognize us.. lol   Mmm I'm In love with this place!!

7pm... Wow He is right on time ... great....   All dressed up for once in my life... Stilettos, LBD, and makeup...  its new for me ... I'm usually in jeans on a date :P   walks me to the car... unlocks the door and walks around... doesn't even bother to open my door while I'm already there? O..K...   As soon as we start walking up to this place I'm automatically excited, i can smell all the good things from inside :)   the lighting is really calming and warm... we were seated right away.. it took a minute for them to get to us for our drink orders ... they had so many take out orders it was insane... so i figured it had to be good right?!   in the mean time i learned that my date is a vegetarian... well that's cool and all but somehow it turned into me defending my right to eat meat... i was really calm about it and just let it roll off but i was annoyed...   as soon as we ordered our food.. like the second the lady walked away he looked at me with the weirdest look ever and said "Aren't you going to go and wash your hands?" WTF!!!!!! like he expected me to just get up and make a dash for the restroom... do i look like I'm 6yo? "um well dude... I'm sure we have some time... ill wait a little before i go and wash my hands... " he continued to look at me like i was gross or something.... weird   he got a Thai beer and i got my usual water with extra lemon :) and the beer was really good... I'm not sure what its called but if you translate the title to English it means brother... (he igoogled it) it had a nice flavor... and its the same price as a soft drink lol score!   once we got our food i was soo excited! i got the sweet and sour chicken .. with steamed white rice... they had the pineapple, onions, green bell peppers and a new one for me... TOMATOES!! and it was delicious!! just amazing...  he had something vegetarian... with noodles and broccoli...   so the whole time throughout dinner he proceeded to laugh out loud with his mouth FULL of food... and talk really loud at me with his mouth still full of food... and i mean its about to fall out of his mouth... it almost ruined my dinner... to bad i was too focused on the bell peppers! mmmm   then he proceeded to pick food off his place and put it on my mine to try... which would have been cool... if he didn't use his HANDS to serve it... I'm glad to know he had just washed his hands but still... really?!?   once we were finished he got the check... then showed me and started bitching about it! it came to a total of $22 and some change... um two dinners plus a beer... man that's a great deal in my eyes... plus I've never had a date show me the bill before... isn't that like a man rule? hmm i thought it was... so he takes care of it and we leave... still with me opening all my own doors... :( and as the drive to the next destination he continued to belch out loud without covering his mouth or saying "pardon me or excuse me" or anything.... and kept talking about how he had to go to the bathroom ... i was horrified!   End Result....   Good Food... Nice and clean bathroom..the soap leaves your hands SUPER soft and touchable :)  The Service was nice...  Nice atmosphere...  Horrible date...  Wish i had had better company :(   oh and i Tossed out his number...

Ive driven past this place on the freeway about a million times and has always vowed that one day, i will try this place!   and out of complete randomness.... it became my Saturday night dinner :)   As we park the car, we could already tell this place was packed! we walked in and there were parties waiting to be seated ... lucky for us... we were seated right away... I'm sure we deemed ugly hungry stares for it to... hey its not our fault their are only two of us....   right after we were seated our drink orders were taken by a very welcoming young gentleman. :)  and out chips and salsa were brought out promptly too!  The Salsa was amazing... and the chips were fresh ... and hot!! that could have been my meal i was so content....   this place has great lighting.... not to bright or too dull... just how i like it.  in the middle of the place there was a huge area where they cooked all the food... or at least some of it... it looked like fun....   we shared the beef Fajitas... they were amazing!! grilled on top of bell peppers and onions... red and white... mm served with rice, beans w/cheese, guacamole and a tray of salsa, sour cream and cheese... it was SO good and they brought out your tortillas in a little bowl with a cover to keep them warm.. but they tasted more like pita bread... either way everything was hot and fresh and out in a very timely fashion.. especially since this place was packed...   i like this place alot... i would love to come back again and maybe sit near the chefs area :)

OKie dokie... so who's has ever been to a bar that served shitty food?? ME!!! But not this place.... I've been here twice... and had their take out a few...   I've never really been much of a wing eater.. but their mild wings are SO good!! I've also had the chicken strips and fries... and today the Cheeseburger and Fries... Wow SO good... i can never finish it all.... the beef patty was really thick and tasted like i grilled it myself...   There is an open patio that is nice and private from the traffic on 35th ave... and is completely shaded so your not burned in our summer sun ... if i were a smoker... i would love it!   The Bartender Amy is amazing... she is like a bumble bee going going all the time... and always has a smile : )   The Bathroom is small... but its clean, doesn't smell and its has all the proper essentials...   Ive only been here during the day so i cant say anything on how they are during the evening.... but if your around the neighborhood on your lunch, i would highly recommend this place : )

I only stayed till about 930 on a Tuesday... and it was pretty full for a Tuesday I'd say :) i cant wait to go back for the Halloween party :)

So tiny.....TOO TINY   i was introduced to every-ones butt or frontal parts and they walked past me trying to get the the bar...   there was a dance floor... but only one couple could dance at a time...  I know country bars very well and well if there is good music you'll wanna dance... well... i couldn't...   It was a Thursday night... so maybe i should go on a slower night... like Monday...   the band was pretty OK...   the security guard was the hottest thing around... :)   and the bathroom was super clean :)    your call

Thursday... sniffles... a little itchy in the throat...  Friday... same plus being more tired than usual.. and now my throat is hurting a little more :(  i get vitamins and Tylenol sinus... take it religiously till Sunday... but by then i feel like i had been dragged through hell by the devil himself! but as stubborn and bullheaded as i am ... i don't go to the doc.. till my mama yells at me over the phone to go... lol you kinda have to after that.. so i come here... from what I've heard it has the shortest wait times.... i go in a little before noon... lots of space... not to many people in their... the front desk folks were really sweet and concerning... it took only minutes before they pulled me back for my vitals and such .. they tagged me with the damn bracelets and i waited not much longer... maybe 10 minutes... i sat in that waiting room longer than i sat in that hospital bed... i was in and out quick... turns out i have an ear infection and strep... i got the work excuse letter and meds... and i was good to go... I'm not much of a hospital lover but ill make an exception when i don't have to be there very long : )

Being sick and nearly alive.. the last thing you ever wanna do is wait in a damn pharmacy for for pills right!? all you wanna do is take some and pass out!  I LOVE THIS PLACE.... even though there were old ladies bout to throw down in line... and only one pharmacy tech on hand (damn economy - cut backs) all in all i only had to wait about 20 minutes ... the cashier and the tech were absolutely lovely and sweet.. even though they were just about to get jumped by an 80yo lady with a hot little temper! this place tops walmart any day .... : )

After hitting up Club Cream.. We walked over to this joint.... never really been around Scottsdale... especially not for the club scene... but that quickly changed over the weekend   you could hear the music blasting from across the street... people pouring out of the doors and the front patio... looked like a great time...   and No Cover!! :) we were happy to try it out....   it reminded me of a pub... it was really crowded with people so i couldnt really tell what was on the walls or anything like that... but the bar was wooden and there was alot of seating :) that made me happy :)  i didn't drink so I'm not sure if it was cheap or not...   but they played great music non stop... and there were really chill down to earth people hanging out... with is hard to come by out in Scottsdale.... so it was fun...   i even got to see a grown man grind on the stripper pole in the back by the DJ stand... haha WOW... yea wow explains it all... he was doing the robot at one time to... i should have told him to go over to Club Cream lol....   the bathroom was decent... but could have been cleaner... (paper towels were the decor')   it was a fun time... i would like to go back in the future :)

OK... so i think i have a thing for bars that are parted into multiple rooms... lol Just like the light house, long horn and so on this bar is separated into the Jester room and Pranksters too....   The Jester room is amazing... It has a full stage... *kinda tiny but it works lol* Tons of seating and a full bar... and some pool tables in the back... the Bands that played were fun, entertaining and it was seriously just a great time :) every night they have several bands signed up to play... and some regulars from what i take it...   we ordered some potato skins... fully loaded... soooo goood!!! the atmosphere was great! not to lite up and not so dark you cant see your own hand in your face... i liked it... the waitresses/bartenders were sweet... didn't really talk to them too much... i was only drinking water.. **DD**    i didn't really spend too much time on the other side... except for the bathrooms... wish i give a 4... they weren't all ritzy or anything but they were clean, with paper in the appropriate places ; ) if ya know what mean....   i am looking forward to going back there asap!! maybe check out the other side while I'm at it :)

At about 7 pm we arrive... a bunch of pilots, flight attendants and mechanics/maintenance ... about 14... they were able to seat us with in 10 minutes... i was stoked!!  we are all seated outside... it was such a beautiful night last night... it was soo nice! the waiter comes up... and says hi... but WE had to ASK him his name... and he was way to relaxed... not very outgoing at all... he gave me the feeling like we interrupted his "Smoke" break.... my bad   while we were waiting for our food i asked for some bread... they brought out a little plate of maybe 8-10 pieces of bread on it... keep in mind we all have not eaten since before noon that day... and we all looked at the plate like um.... o...k...   when the food FINALLY came i was soo excited... the whole place had smelled amazing since walking up from the parking lot!! (which was kinda small and packed) but i was quickly disappointed... the pizza was soo thin... the toppings fell right off the pizza.. and there was virtually no sauce at all!! :( the crust was the best part of the whole thing...   my friend and i decided to get a piece of cheesecake to hopefully save the meal... NOPE... not even close... i almost wanted to cry... cheesecake is my all time most favorite dessert and it was ruined!  the crust was waxy and just gross... the cake part tasted a little weird... kinda like the crust and to mushy.. like they didn't give it enough time to set.. it was awful...   their menu has salad appetizers, pizza and calzones... and desert.. that's it... no pastas or anything else so there isn't much to choose from... :( their water with lemon was my favorite part of the meal.. sad..   Over all.....  The bathrooms were decent..  Parking was not to great.. The food Sucked....  Service could have been WAY better....  and it was WAY OVERPRICED!!!!!!!!!!   if i ever go back... I'm just gonna order Water with extra lemon...

Ive been here twice... in the same week.(guilty....)   the first time i walked in and it smelt heavenly!! i could smell the grills smoking away :)   i love the retro interior... the silver and white tables and walls... i guess us blondes just like shiny things... who knows...   i ordered a regular burger and a drink... the service was quick and orderly... i liked that there was a lot of room for people to wait and for those of us already seated don't have to have butts in our faces while we try to eat... that's a perk for sure...   the location isn't to bad either... and like i said its huge for being a burger joint on such a busy street....   the Second time i went i had the turkey burger.... it was AMAZING!!!!!!!  it didn't make me feel like i wished i hadn't .... it tasted in some ways better... and my favorite part of these delicious burgers is that they put RELISH on them as well and PICKLES!!!!! yum!!!!   if i could... i would so eat here everyday.... mmmmmmmmmmmmm   ::drooling::

Hmm... ok.. great music... i liked the big screen music videos going...  aside from that... ugh.....  no where to sit... unless you get a VIP... which is CRAP... its like two step away from sitting the floor! wtf....   the go-go dancers were cute and enthusiastic...   the club is split into two rooms... cool and all but they were exactly the same!! no where to sit when your tired and way to crowded to function.... whats the point of a dance club if you don't have the room to DANCE? right??   their were body guards at your every move.. and it was seriously kind of creepy if you ask me.... before i went to this place, i was all hyped up... hearing all kinds of great things... it was poppin... fun.... so much dancing and cool people.... um correction... every guy there was busy having a dude fest... all interested in themselves.. its was weird... no interaction... people crowding the dance floor... that weren't even dancing... hmm...   over all... it was totally ruined for me.....

Wow... i don't think I've ever been in a more narrow place.. ever!   but it was just perfect in ever way!!!   They have tables along one side and a bar with tall stools along the other side... you can watch them make your food....  its like the food network... but live and you can smell it :)   my coworker and i sat right in front of the oven... every time they would open the oven i would only get hungrier!! :) we could see all the fresh and yummy ingredients!!   i had the Reuben (Pastrami, corned beef, homemade sauerkraut and Swiss with a side of 1000 island dressing)   WOW... it was amazing... for their sauerkraut they use red cabbage... it was more sweet than bitter... and the crust of the pasty was flaky and buttery... so delicious!! and i honestly forgot how much i love corned beef! over all it was very rich... but great to share....   My Coworker had the Italian.. (pepperoni, salami, ham, mozzarella, basil, tomatoes and marinara sauce) it looked great... he loved it... you could see the fresh basil and tomatoes... it smelled divine   we didn't speak for a full 20 minutes... just barley loud enough mmmmmmmms and o-m-g this is amazing... said quietly to ourselves....   all of the employees were so outgoing and laid back at the same time... just really cool guys... i loved the atmosphere and the attitudes that filled this place...   i cannot wait to come back!

Johnjay and Rich in the Morning is absolutely Amazing!! i love it....   they are so funny, out of the box original....  I've honestly not laughed so hard in my car driving to work ..alone... in a long time...   i started listening to them regularly about 4 months ago and i have yet to regret it.... the topics they come up with are great, and the callers are ...well... they make you laugh for one reason or another... that's on you what for lol   the only downer is the occasional repeat of the same songs throughout the day... but its radio sadly it happens....   On the other hand the mix of the music is great and helps me get through my day :)   Take a Listen ....

I have been a pure fitness member for almost two years, and have worked out at almost all the locations... and this has so far been my favorite!!   --The Trainers/Employees--   They are all Very out going and Eager to help anyone out with any kind of problem or question you might have. Very knowledgeable about the equipment and their attitudes are always they best.   They offer one free workout, measurements and reevaluation a month... to help keep you on track with your goals... it doesn't take long to build a relationship with the employees here.. they are so active with all the clients... its a great and comfortable atmosphere :)   --Equipment--   a wide range of assorted machines. they are rarely crowded... except for the peak hours... which still its not that bad. most of the cardio machines have TVs (for headsets) on them, with a bunch of great channel's.... (helps a long cardio workout go by faster when you forget your IPod lol). The equipment is new and reliable.   The People that attend this gym varies in age and its great... very polite and great people to work out with.....   The child care is great... The care takers are attentive, sweet and knowledgeable :) which is a great breath of fresh air.   The locker rooms are clean and spacious... including a nice sauna :) always a plus!!   Over all i LOVE THIS GYM... and would recommend it to everyone!

This place had a dividing wall... one side pool tables and darts... and the dinning area (for normal restaurant hours) and the other side was a full bar with a dance floor....   Well wall no more!   This place is one huge wide open room... its much more spacious and as always lots of seating and tables... it awesome....   Outside they have built more to their outdoor bar... laid down more cement for a larger patio.... its a little too cold to be hanging outside for too long.. but once summer hits its going to be the main floor... guaranteed!!   The bathrooms are clean as always... be careful, the hot water is extremely hot... right away .... ouch...   The staff is friendly and fun as always.... :)   Cant wait to get another chance to come back out for a visit! :)  Oh and Kareoke is on Thursdays....

I received a yellow post it note on my desk written in black ink..   DINNER TONIGHT @ 6 SHARP!   DILLONS....   twice underlined....   that being said i must go right?   we walk in and people are leaving with smiles and laughs... the atmosphere was so warm and welcoming..   I love the Decor... little cows all over the place... some with wings.. and pigs too... it was adorable! reminds me of walking into my friends grandparents house...   their menu has a nice selection... :)   our waitress was very bubbly and attentive...   he had smoked sausage and brisket.. he raved over it... but i didn't want to try it... he had the HOT BBQ sauce.... i didn't have my tums...   i had the pulled pork with the sweet BBQ sauce... oh my... it was amazing... the pork alone was so tender and just fabulous! and the awesome BBQ sauce just topped it off...   their potato salad is great to.. i think they used red potatoes... which are my favorite...   i like that they have a veggie of the day... that day was Broccoli... it was tasty!   their bread roll was wheat.. so i was excited... but it wasn't that great.. maybe next time....   the lemon Water was fabulous as always...   Over all...   service ... AWESOME  Food.... Cant Beat it  Bathroom... Clean and Tidy  Atmosphere.. homey and relaxing...   I cant wait to go again :)

I have been to this location a few different times... and its a very relaxing, comfortable and enjoyable atmosphere.   Its small and homey.... the Bartenders are friendly, helpful and really down to earth.   The Stools! Ugh... i would say that's the worst thing about it! lol I'm constantly repositioning myself... in kind of embarrassing when your in a skirt! lol oh well.....   For it being a down town up scale-ish bar.... i think the pricing is alright... it could be worse...lol   The Bathroom is CLEAN!!! a bar with a clean bathroom... if your doing well.. you spend half your time in their anyways.. lol it should be clean right?! 120% in that department! :)   ...and the great part is that there is always parking!!! i don't mean out and around and up the street a mile... its right behind the the bar... off the street!   I love it... anyone wanna go again?? :P

THANK YOU to all my fellow yelpers...  i had looked this place up before hand.... and knew it was a dud... but failed to notice that this place played TECHNO!!!!!!!! and that's it!! and not even decent techno this night.... they had a special DJ in from Germany... and well i was bored... there was a group of like 14 of us... just standing there... we were gonna leave so they bought us a bottle... oh grey goose vodka... well i didn't care either way... i was DD   the atmosphere was pretty cool... the lighting was fun.... NO seating almost... which was lame... if I'm dancing around in 4.5 inch heels all night... I'm gonna wanna sit down at some point....   the best part of the night is that my friend i hadn't seen in forever was the bouncer!! It was good to see him and Chat...   i would go again... only because now i know i can get on the list.. lol  and i here Saturdays are best.... they play the top 40..but still techno... if you like that sorta thing... then this is your place

i have some muscle spasms that i use to go to physical therapy for.. and when I'm really stressed i can feel the knots forming.. its horrible...   well i started here not to long ago.. and I've had a different person each time... the therapist are very well trained and know what they are doing.. which is a breath of fresh air!! the rooms are so clean and relaxing with nice calming music... all the personnel are very calm, helpful and respectful to all of your needs :)   they have this ''Relaxation Room" that you wait for you massage in.... and it has comfy couches and dim lighting.. and the relaxation music... i love it!   when they take you back, they ask you what sort of massage your looking for, relaxation, deep tissue, Swedish or if you have any special issues.. like injuries and such... that way you get a custom massage each time you go! and its always amazing!!!   after your massage they leave the room to allow you to dress and are waiting in the main hall for you with a fresh cup of water! :) and then they walk you out :) its charming!   the bathroom is fully equipped with mouth wash, lotion, hand sanitizer... and so on... :)   over all i love this place... going for a two hour massage soon... ill be sure to do another review :)

This is some goooood pizza.... and the customer service is just as good :)   i got there early waiting for my friend... so i sat down and right away the little blonde girl came over from behind the counter and asked me if i wanted anything ... (water with lemon lol)   from what i saw you order from the counter.. pay.. sit down and they then bring you your food... i thought it to be a nice gesture :) especially since she didn't have to :)   my friend finally showed up... it was grub time !!   i had the Hawaiian and pepperoni and a side salad with ranch...   first off the salad was amazing! red onions chopped up in it and carrots and other stuff too not like a normal side salad with iceberg lettuce and some croutons.... i was happy :)   the pizza slices were huge.. and they were generous with the toppings :)  the pineapples tasted awesome and my favorite part of the pizza was the crust.. :) (and that goes for any pizza.. i love bread! Italian for sure )   and their menu is huge... lots of choices and i like that... especially since i change my mind alot lol   they had a bunch of flat screen TVs on the walls... with different channels on each one... i like that... who wants to watch the same game on every TV you see..!!   i really liked the food and the atmosphere and especially the employees... they were friendly, helpful and very prompt with out food :)   i will be back for lunch again in the future :)
