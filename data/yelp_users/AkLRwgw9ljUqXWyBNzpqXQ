Sure do love some Honey Bears!  Cheap tasty eats for us carnivores.  Luckily for me, this location is 5 minutes from my work making it one of my favorite lunch break spots.  I would give it an extra star if it had the cool ambience of the Van Buren location but alas, it feels like a 1980's fast food joint.

I crave this place, I dream of their Peking Duck. Better than sex, well maybe not better, but a close runner up. Went here with J.W. and a number of other friends for my birthday; great fun, fantastic food! Don't let the hoody decor scare you off, experience the Gourmet House!

I go here once a year for a super mega dorkathon.  Going by the name IG-88, I have cleaned up on Stef (AKA Wedge) numerous times.  Here's the key to winning, shoot little kids.  I know it's harsh, but they're such easy targets!  The only danger is that they sometimes gang up, there's nothing worse than Children of the Damned hellions with laser guns!

I'm not going to judge you for eating at PF Changs, after all, I did eat at Pei Wei two nights ago-thus the 2 stars, not just one. However, I did wake up the next morning with the shits.. maybe I oughta rethink that extra star!

Ahhh, teen angst!  My student Kelly works here and she rules so I have to give it 2 instead of 1 stars.  No one understands my pain, I cut myself so I feel alive.  I wear black on the outside because black is how I feel on the inside.  Mom and dad just don't get me. I am too original, my style absolutely has never, EVER been done before!  Punk is NOT corporate!!  Seriously though, I have never shopped here.

My wife and my first kiss was in the Roadhouse!  She accused me of overly thinking through things, at which point I had drank enough beers to spontaniously make out with her.  We made others uncomfortable and I had her lipstick smeared all over my face, FIVE STARS!!

This is the premier contemporary art gallery in the city.  I almost want to take one star away just because it is in Scottsdale, but I won't do that, it is just petty of me, kind of like most (not all) of the people who live in Scottsdale.  Anyhow, my wife works there, so it must be cool!  By the way, the opening for "The Border Film Project" is this Friday 10/13, you should all go, there will be booze!

I wanted to get an Arizona half sleeve to cover up a crappy tattoo that I had gotten done while 15 so I went to some cheapo in Chandler.. bad move.  So, I came here after and asked Alex if he could "Awesome this up" he did, and now it's rad!  Good price, great work, this is where I'm going from now on!

I LOVE the Delux burger!  Plus it has Kolsh on tap which is awesome by me!  The rest of the menu.. not so exciting, but damn that burger is good!

My absolute favorite local bar, stylish but not pretentious. Has a diverse jukebox, a great scotch menu and Stella on tap. Love it!  Also, I have a secret, totally plotonic (cuz I'm married) crush on the bartender Julie.

I drive all the way across town, from Arcadia to Tempe for Restaurant Mexico's green corn tamales. Alright, it's only a 15 minute drive, but I'll tell ya, I'm drooling the whole way. Rumor has it that "the man" is going to tear down the whole block to build a high rise, I hope and pray that Restaurant Mexico relocates to the empty ice cream joint over on 38th street and Indian School so I can just walk across the street for its yummy awesomeness. I had to take away one star because the salsa is inconsistant, when it's good, it's awesome but when it's not it resembles watery soup.

It is absolutely refreshing to find a mechanic who is honest and doesn't try to push unnecessary repairs on you.  I trust Joel at Az Imports, if you're looking for a good mechanic in Tempe I couldn't speak highly enough about them!

Little food for alot of money.  It's definitely good, and I would highly recommend it for a date, but it will hurt your pocketbook.  The ambience is fantastic, a little more conservative than Bar Bianco, but has a similar vibe and reflects the same time frame.  Not for vegitarians, if you're green, don't even try it.

The name of this place sounds like it should be a secret swingers joint, but I do believe it is not although last time one of my buddies was here, he got hit on by a cougar.  Instead, it's a sweet little hole in the wall bar serving delicious New Mexican cuisine and yummy beer.  It's dark with limited room at the bar and few tables however that just adds to the ambiance.  Dicks is a great place to watch a game if you don't want to go to some lame ass sports bar or just a fun place to grab a brew with one of your friends.  Rock on Dicks.. hmmm, that sounded really bad.

Matt's (of Matt's Big Breakfast) new bar.  Located in a cozy vintage home, this is my new favorite bar.  Handpicked beer and wine selection make this an excellent destination for downtown snobs (not rippin, I tend to be one of those)  Best of all, Matt has jumped on the smoking ban before it even takes effect, this means you can enjoy your beer without having to breathe in all that nasty ass poison you smokers keep pumping into the air.  Seriously, Lesley and I went to a dinner party recently filled with smokers, in a non ventilated home.  Jesus, God, how do you people stand it?!?  Smoking is gross, The Roosevelt is cool.

Best shop in town for your indie rawkin needs! Kimber and her staff know their music and are aware of their customers preferences. I dare you to leave this store without something interesting and exciting

This place takes everything that is lame about Scottsdale and wraps it into one neat little package in Phoenix.  I was so excited for a new bar in the hood, but then this showed up.  Bad food, plastic people, crappy music, too sterile.  Pretty poopy.

I'm about to blow my secret.. I know I may be making a huge mistake but here it is..  THIS THEATER IS NEVER CROWDED!!  I know that posting this info is totally going to screw this dynamic, but I figured I'd let you in on this little secret.  I've seen so many opening night flicks here because of the lack of crowds; Star Wars, Spiderman 3, Cloverfield and I have never had to struggle with lines.  Ooooohh, also-they have this fancy ass kiosk that you can access outside to buy your tix that noone uses.  Utilizing this gizmo lets you not wait in the ticket buying lines!  One more thing.. on the off chance that there is a line waiting to get into the opening night screening, take the elevator to the second level and enter through the secret door at the top of the theater!  If they give you grief, do what my friend Diana did and pitch a fit "IT'S NOT POSTED"  then they'll let you in!  Primo seats!

I went 4 months without a haircut just so that  Ali could cut my hair when she got back from filming the secret reality show that she's in.  Love these folks, I would hang out with all of them outside the salon.  I have a cold and my brain doesn't work well enough to write a good review, sorry.  I'll write more on decongestant.

THIS is the place to go if you want to break your collar bone!  Miles of competitive course- ups, downs, berms, jumps, technical, FAST!  I took a buddy of mine out here the first time I went mountain biking with him, we were on the Long Loop for no longer than 10 minutes when we came to a STEEP drop.  I took it and it was fine but there was some sand down in the ravine, he took it and unfortunately hit the brakes when he hit the sand.  My friend (let's call him "Mike") went FLYING!  Stop, drop and roll.  "Mike" stood up and said, while rubbing his shoulder, "something doesn't feel right" So we walked our bikes back to the car and ran into some hippies with "whiskey".  "Mike" said, "Go take the 3 mile sport loop, I'm gonna hang with these guys"  So I took it.  DAMN, that was 12 TONS OF FUN!!  (I am in love with capital letters today, the coffee just kicked in!)  Took "Mike" to the emergency room after, his collar bone had multiple breaks.  A few weeks later I brought another friend, we'll call him "Eric" out there, took the Long Loop but made the mistake of telling him where "Mike" busted himself up.  "Eric" ended up walking down Collar Bone Gulch instead of riding that spot.  I highly recommend it, wear your helmet!  ***  Hi, this is "Eric."  I may not be a GIANT COCKSWINGING STUD like Aaron, but at least my collarbone is intact.  Fucker.

I hadn't been to the climbing gym in years and it was time to start back.  Went on Saturday and had a blast; varied routes, fun bouldering, helpful staff and a few automatic belays in case your partner wants to check something else out while you go up a route.  Seriously considering purchasing a membership.  My forearms are still sore.
