Ok...change if heart here...Well...if you have a party of eaters and not big afternoon drinkers you will get told to move to a less desirable table.  Even if you're a fat tipper...or would have been prior to being told to move so the alcohol party could have you table in front of the big screen. Hmmmmm...and you can reserve a cabana if you -commit to spending at least $200 if you fall sorry of the $200 you must purchase a gift card to make up the difference. Seriously?  Id rather just rent it out than be told what I have to spend to sit there.

Incredibly delicious menu, many choices from gourmet burgers to seafood, pasta and salads.  Something for everyone. Extensive wine list & signature cocktails.  Exceptional atmosphere, indoor outdoor seating.  Highly recommend whether a special occasion or just looking for a great place to dine and socialize!

OK...I have found the jewel in the desert GURLS!!!  I went to Primp and Blow just to see what it was all about as I live in the neighborhood...I was greeted by the kewlest staff who made me feel welcome immediatley, I was offered the red carpet, white glove treatment for an amazing deal to check out what they offer.  I have gone back a few times for a "Feel good" and have discovered the answer to the "unruly fuzzy hair blues" ...KERATIN TREATMENT Baby!!  Are you serious???  This treatment is amazing, my hair (Normally takes forever to style) is silky smooth, looks amazingly healthy and takes about 10 minutes to dry and NO ironing needed!!!  The staff was so kind giving me all the options prior to my treatment to make certain it was EXACTLY what my lifestyle and hair needed!!!  I LOVE this place!!  Treat yourself and call, thank me later ;)

Absolute best me time!  Service is friendly, staff is so talented in making you look and feel your best!  I am taken such good care of everytime I am here and have never loved my hair more than I do now!  Primp and Blow hair extensions are my recommendation to anyone looking for a change to sexy, full, beautiful hair!  Unlike others I have seen, these have no damaging glue, wax or heat, they are so low maintainance and last for up to 2 years!  Highly recommended!  this place!

I frequent the newly remodeled Grayhawk location. Whether you are looking for a great spot for drinks and sports or have hunger pains, you can always count on a great experience here.  Monster portions, delicious burgers, salads, appetizers, sandwiches and more!  Indoor outdoor seating, patio heaters for brisk AZ nights!  A favorite local spot!  Highly recommend.

WORSE WORSE WORSE CUSTOMER SERVICE IN THE UNIVERSE!  Lisa in the front office billing is as rude as they come.  I called for a brief Q & A regarding my bill.  I could not even explain my situation before being repeatedly cut off and told it did not matter what I thought, the bill is what I owed.  WHAT?  I asked to talk to the manager and someone else got on the phone and did not even ask me what the situation was.  She just stated that she heard what Lisa told me and that was correct.  When I asked if I could explain my concern she told me no, call your insurance company.  Further more, when I took my son in for an appointment, they told me to come back for a follow up...I waited 45 minutes for them to put us in a room, come in and tell us we were good to go.  WHAT????  You did not even do anything???  They asked us to pay the office visit and they would bill our insurance company.  FOR WHAT???  TOTAL SCAM services here and no pleasant way around this...business must be good because they certainly do not need mine and they padded the bill and did NOTHING to justify what they charged me for. You know that funny feeling you get when you are in an office as a new customer that you just can;'t put your finger on it...NEXT TIME...i'll go with my gut.  Ridiculous.  Making money hand over fist by over charging and under delivering.  They should be ashamed for the way they do business.  ROTTEN.  I'd go anywhere but here for this type of services.

Best Cadillac dealership in the valley.  Formerly Legends bought by Earnhardt.  Most of the same employees.  Exceptional customer service, not your typical car buying experience.  Not pushy, very helpful and they listen to what you want.  Highly recommend!
