Clean, great food, and a great family restaurant. I like to go as an adult, but I can take my niece and nephew for a day as well.

Harkins theaters vary greatly in quality. This is one of the finest Harkins I have been to in several states. I highly recommend the trip to this location.

Very fair prices. A lot of seating, cool music, and the drinks are the best part. The service is terrible with a lot of grumpy employees. If you can get past that, the drinks and atmosphere are why you should go.

The food is only a one star. It's usually burnt when you get it. The service is two stars. Slow service even when not busy. A lot of TV's and great interior. I just wish the owners would bump up food and service.
