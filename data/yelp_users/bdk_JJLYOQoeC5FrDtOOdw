I lived in Colonial Grand North from 2012-2014. These apartments are okay. Yes, the location is great for Old Town. The golf carts are close enough to come pick you up. I had a roommate so the rent was fine to split between two people however the one bedroom apartments are expensive. The actual apartment was a little run down. Our dishwasher was broken when we moved in and our washer flooded our apartment numerous times. We did not have a working washer for a good two months, which is not okay when you need to wash your clothes! Our microwave was broken for a good six months and then a month before we moved out, we got a new one. The biggest problem with the place is that the appliances are old and it takes forever to get them fixed. Also, the fitness room was disgusting when we moved in! Half of the machines were broken and we didn't get new equipment until about  two months before we moved out.   This place does party so if you are young this is a fun place for you but I would not recommend this place to families or someone that needs peace and quiet.  Another thing is that the management company needs to figure out the online payment system. Roommates need more time than the day of to figure out payment. The fact that we can't do two payments was ridiculous and I would have to write a check for my roommate to cash early so she could pay our rent on time.  I would also say that the customer service from the property management team needs help. I would come in to pick up a package and would not even get acknowledged. If you try calling the office, almost 100% of the time would get a voicemail and may not get a call back until the next day.  Overall, this complex is fine for a short term or if you are young and need a safe place to live. I never felt unsafe. However, they need some big upgrades and a new customer service team. The maintenance team is very nice but I think they need to hire more guys to get the jobs done faster.

I'm not really sure what happened to Firehouse. I used to love coming here with my friends to dance and have a good time but now it's not worth it. You have to pay at the door and it's really trashy. A bar that was once very casual and friendly is now just a rip off of a club with fake people. Welcome to Scottsdale.

I really enjoy going to Spanish Fly on Sundays. They have an awesome mimosa deal from 11am-2pm unlimited mimosas for only $10! It's definitely worth it. Every time my friends and I go, we always ask for JJ. She is awesome and always comes around to fill drinks before we even ask. I have eaten the chicken quesadilla there with grilled veggies. It's to die for! Definitely worth checking out. I highly recommend it if you are tired of not being able to sit anywhere and being too crowded at the new beach club, Maya. If you want a chill afternoon with cool people then I'd recommend bringing your suit and hanging out at Spanish Fly.

I absolutely love their hot dogs! Very friendly staff and the food was out in a flash.
