Super knowledgable, great set up. A little out of the way for me, but still loved the place.

Ill premise this by saying I was incredibly optimistic about trying this place out! I called to make an appointment. After being told I had an appointment in 30 minutes, I arrived. I checked in and was told I was going to have to wait 15-20 minutes (even though I had an appointment). Frustrated, since this was the exact reason I originally called. I waited patiently. While waiting I was then told 5 minutes later that would be 30 more minutes. I thought about waiting but then called another place I know I love and they could get me in right then. When I left there was no one who even noticed when I got up to walk out. I was hoping to give this new place a chance. While it is beautiful inside-I don't think I'll try again or recommend it to anyone. I am incredibly disappointed with the service.
