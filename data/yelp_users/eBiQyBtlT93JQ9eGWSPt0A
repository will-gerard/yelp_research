Wow. I went here today with a couple dozen knives that I needed sharpened. The staff was super friendly and knowledgable. They did a tremendous job and got all my knives razor sharp. I would suggest this place for all your knife needs. They specialize in Japanese knives and a chef would be in heaven here. They can also sharpen your cutco (even serrated) and henkels without voiding warranty.  Worth the drive drive from anywhere in the valley. I will be back !

If you like bland food, slow impersonal service then this is the place for you. Just left the "Mother's Day" lunch. We don't know our servers name, we had to ask for drinks to be replenished, and left a tiny tip which I rarely do. But it is the reason I hate "posh" places. Blah. Spend $70+ elsewhere.

Office and restrooms are very dusty and dirty. Staff is rude and to busy with inside gossip then to help or be even cordial. I was referred by my primary so I drove all the way from the far west valley. To be treated like crap. Love it.
