I think the first time I came to this place I had on some serious beer goggles. Second time... definitely worse than the first.  Fair warning: DON'T COME HERE FOR ROLLS. Because every roll on the menu (and specialty rolls not on the menu) are all glorified California rolls. The only difference between any of the rolls is the sauce or the extra ingredient. If you get a roll, you can pretty much expect it to have Krab (yes, Krab with a K) salad (translation: fake imitation crab meat packed with mayo), cucumber, and rice.   We came on a Friday night craving sushi. I got the sake nigiri and the whitefish nigiri. The fish was okay quality- definitely okay for the desert.... but this was on a Friday night (when they most likely received their freshest fish)... so any other night could possibly be a bust.  Service was good. The place inside could definitely be improved with more tables and more intimate lighting.   And the edamame always seems to look brown. boooooooooo.  Prices are decent... but you definitely get what you pay for.

It's so promising. Great specials. Awesome space. TV's everywhere. Full bar. Good food. Great place to grab some beers before and after a spring training game.  But service sucks. I don't understand why I have to be carded at the door, carded at the table, then carded at the bar. There were 3 groups in the entire place, and we still got slow and crappy service.   I wish I had better things to say. But really.... the experience completely sours the good things about this place.

$3.50 you call its on Thursdays! YES PLEASE!!!!!  Okay... so it's hooters. So the quality of food is hooters quality (aka greasy, not great quality, and can be pretty bland).  But the girls are hotter here because they actually TRY. The service is always great. The managers know what they're doing and it's clear that they work their butts off to make this place an awesome place to hang out and to come back to.  Would love to see more TVs though. I understand that people come to gawk at girls, but I come to gawk at games.

Hiking Camelback is something that I itch for now that I'm not in Phoenix.  It's challenging, and you feel it for days after your hike. Seriously? Any time you have to climb rocks for a 1.2 miles and need a handrail on a hike, you know it's tough.  But this hike is not for the faint of legs or for quitters. Because the hike down is just as rough as the hike up.   Make sure your shoes have some grip. I prefer to wear shoes that stabilize, or shock-absorbing shoes for the jump down. And bring lots of water, because that heat will catch up to you as you climb higher. EAT beforehand because you will use a LOT of energy. If you have space, bring a camera... because if you make it all the way up, you will want to record the moment!!!  AMAZING views from the top, and there always is a gratifying breeze to welcome you.   I miss you, Camelback. Hands down, you are the BEST short hike in without feeling making me feel fat.

Be warned: Their sweet potato fries will haunt your dreams. They're so delicious and perfect and will call your name whenever you smell a french fry.   Actually... I think it's safe to say that everything on their menu will haunt you in your dreams. I've never had anything not delicious and craveable. Throw a dart at the menu and I will guarantee that it is delicious. Don't even think about splitting something with a friend because you will destroy your friendship.   The service is always on point, their bartenders are hilarious, and the ambiance is amazingly energetic.  I LOVE THIS PLACE. Please move it to the Bay area. But until then, I will have to fly to Phoenix just to get my fix.

Every Phoenix visit, I make it a point to come to Matt's. BUT... once a year is just not enough. And though my time in Phoenix is always limited, that hour and a half wait for a table is worth the wait every single time.  If you're here for breakfast, order the special. You will never be disappointed. It's usually some sort of scramble, with fresh local ingredients. The potatoes with rosemary always hits the spot. Do yourself a favor and get the LARGE freshly squeezed orange juice. The small is a tiny little thing, and if you're gonna spend the money, spend the extra buck and get more.  My favorite lunch item is the Rueben. BEST RUEBEN EVER. And I've had my share of reubens. This sandwich is magic in your mouth. The last time I had one, I decided that I also wanted breakfast, so I had them add an over-easy egg in the sandwich. That was heaven in my mouth---- I still dream of that particular sandwich.  A majority of the items on the menu are made with local ingredients (jam, bread, and coffee included). The service is ALWAYS fast and friendly. And as tiny as the place is, they turn tables quickly and keep everything immaculately clean.  I love Matts. Best breakfast in the entire state of Arizona. Oh yeah. I just said that. And I meant it.

This place makes me want to come to Phoenix more often.  We came here after an A's Spring Training game because it's right down the street and close to the freeway. I half expected a third of the park to show up because it's one of the closest bars--- and it was happy hour on a Monday. And there was a check-in special. And there's plenty of space.   The place is a bit hard to find. There's not much else around, so it looks like just another office building. Unless you are actually looking for it, you'll completely miss the place. WIN for us!!!! We walked in, and there were 4 other people there. The bartender was the only one working, so we sat ourselves. Then we realized.... it's a bar.... of course you're gonna seat yourself.   The bartender was nice enough to come over with some menus and to take our drink orders. She was SASSY! and I loved it. We ordered a round of beers, our $5 pitcher of liquor (check-in special), and waited. And waited. Other people started meandering in and our bartender got slammed. BOO. But lucky for us, her counterpart came in shortly and helped out.  We ordered Tot-chos (jalape√±o tots w/ nacho toppings)- YUMMYYYY!!!! I totally am still craving these. And had to order another order shortly after. I also had the corned beef sandwich---- HOLY CRAP it was the best corned beef sandwich I've ever had in my entire life. So tender. So juicy. And came with tots! The chipotle sauce they add on it was the perfect complement! This is the sandwich I've always dreamed of.   We stayed for a few hours- drinking beer (great beer on tap, BTW), playing pool, playing shuffle board, and taking $1 kamikazes. 'Twas a wonderful monday night.  I will be back.

Sorry, had to deduct a star because it's freakin EXPENSIVE for lawn seats. Really Glendale? You're gonna charge $13 for lawn seats?   It's a BEAUTIFUL facility! Plenty of grass, plenty of seats, plenty of shade, and a plethora of food choices... all which perfectly align with the baseball experience.

It was our last day in Scottsdale and had a long day of travel ahead. We decided to stop in at the Herb Box because it was a beautiful day out, it was walking distance from the office, and the food looked yummy!  Thank you Yelpers, for this place did not disappoint! We shared the cilantro crab dip - creamy, crabby goodness that had just enough acidity to get our palates going. The plantain chips were an excellent touch - the perfect vehicle for all of that crabby yumminess. I had the burger (medium) on ciabatta. It was cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly, and had the most amazing apple coleslaw to add crunch, bite, and contrast. These came with sweet potato chips which were absolutely addicting! We also shared a side of the gouda mac and cheese - very cheesy, but surprisingly not heavy at all!  Our server was fantastic! Our waters never emptied, our soda/tea stayed full, and he always checked in at appropriate times. This was the best possible way to end our short trip :)

Our group of 3 wandered in after 10pm looking for something to soak up the booze. Luckily, one of our 3 just happened to be the Duke, and boy were we treated well!  I ordered the pork belly appy - and it was everything I've ever wanted in a small bite. Pork belly pastrami. Rye spaetzle. Brussel sprout sauerkraut. Mustard jus. I will never look at a Rueben the same way ever again. This took something so comforting and elevated it. My mouth still waters just thinking about it.   Service was great! Definitely looking forward to my next meal here!

My first experience with Wildflower was when I asked a friend to get me anything she would recommend on the menu. She came back with a chicken pesto pasta that knocked my socks off! The basil pesto was not oily, the pasta perfectly al dente, and the chicken was still moist. The spinach and roasted bell pepper was the perfect addition to the party in my mouth. After that, I was hooked.  Fast forward to March of 2013, when I have moved 700 miles away from the nearest Wildflower Cafe. The BF and I were in Peoria for Spring Training, and I had a hankering for a light snack, a refreshing tea, and a place to hide from the blazing sun for just a few minutes. We were heading back to the hotel and happened to pass by this location on the way. Excited... I quickly made a U-turn and breathed a sigh of relief.... as I just found my relief.  I had a melon green tea, the chopped salad, and a cookie. All were delicious. If we were there before the game, I would have had much, much more. The quality of food at this location mirrors the location that I am used to (Avondale). It is still relatively new, so the booths are fresh and everything still shines. The staff was very friendly and the food came out very quickly.  Hoping that this new location is a success so that they can slowly make their way to California!
