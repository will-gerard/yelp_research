I think they are fantastic. I have had for at least 12 years. They have replaced or fixed the air conditioners, hot water heaters, appliances, garbage disposal, pool filter, and a lot more. Read the contract.

We recently purchased a used car from them. They advertised it at this fantastic low price. Then we get there and they add on about $1500 of "dealer" options. We were not given the option of declining the etching, cloth warranty, and lifetime tinting. They gave us this paper something to sign and it said it included gap. Wow. They zapped us with another $800 and started the extended warranty at $3000; however, we agreed upon $1400 but we canceled it. The car is in great shape but we should have been given the option of purchasing those additional options. We got our own financing and warranty ( literally the warranty and gap with the credit union did not equal the cost of their warranty). Had we understood that the paper we were signing (which made it look like gap was included), we would have never bought that car from them...regardless of the condition and low mileage.   They appeared nice, but overall, the dealership is a ripoff. If you can go elsewhere, do it to avoid all of the hidden costs.
