The staff at San Riva is terrific. It's nice to know that I can count on them to take care of any issues quickly,  professionally, and with a smiile! I just renewed my lease for the fourth time without reservation. The property is well maintained, clean, quiet and safe.

I've been a patient at Arizona's Vision since 2007, and I'm very pleased with the care I've received. The office has the most state-of-the-art diagnostic equipment--it's actually a really interesting process now! I've seen both Drs. Page and Yamamoto and recommend them without reservation.  My only criticism is that I wish they carried  a wider variety of styles of knock-off/off brand frames (they actually do have many reasonably priced frames--but they're all pretty similar).  I've purchased several pairs at AV over the years that were $400-500 (just for the frames), but I'm on a much tighter budget now. I can get a complete pair of really stylish glasses for under $150 at Warby Parker (online), so I'm finding it increasingly difficult to justify paying such high markups elsewhere.

Fantastic service all around. The front desk staff is friendly and efficient (and I've never had to wait more than five minutes for an appointment). Very comprehensive eye exams with state-of-the art diagnostic equipment. Dr. Yamamoto is wonderful. The frame selection is so good, it's hard to choose, and I appreciate that the range of frame styles has improved to include some great styles that are affordable. My daughter just got her second pair of glasses from AV and loves them!

If I was just rating my stylist, Kelly Reid, I'd give five stars.  She is fantastic at what she does, and it's always a pleasure to sit in her chair.  She does beautiful work (I would know; I get nothing but compliments on my hair).  That said, I find the salon's style itself not to my tastes.  It's a bit lacking in personality, or maybe just trying too hard to appeal to ladies that lunch.  That said, the front desk staff is very friendly. The product lines are top notch.  I have no complaints about how the salon is run. Overall, well worth the money for the level of service.

Update:  I am very happy to report that this location was recently renovated and the new interior is a huge improvement.  It no longer looks like it was designed by one of the Real Housewives of Wherever (mishmash faux Tuscan, etc).  The space now feels fresh and energetic.  I'm still waiting to see if anything will come of the "coffee" wall--a geometric arrangement of bright K-cups.  I was told that the plan was for the salon to use that space for their coffee service, but so far, it's just a colorful wall, and when I visited yesterday with my daughter, I was brought a cup of coffee from the back of the salon.  Next time, I should remember to stop at Starbucks first.  About this visit:  stylist Katie does an outstanding job managing the ten tons of hair on my daughter's head.  (seriously; it's very long and very heavy)  I have watched Katie evolve from apprentice to stylist, and I'm very impressed with her work.  In fact, if I ever couldn't get an appointment with Kelly, I'd ask for Katie.  That's how much I trust her!  It's a bit of a bummer to have to pay $45 for my ten year-old's haircut, especially since she doesn't even get it blown dry.  Still, it takes a very skilled stylist to handle her hair properly, and this is definitely a case of getting what you pay for.  Furthermore, I feel it's my duty as her parent to teach my daughter to hold businesses to a high standard.  No one should accept a mediocre product, regardless of the price.    One more thing: I cannot recall the name of Kelly's current apprentice, but that young lady recently gave me the BEST shampoo I've ever had.  The scalp massage was greatly appreciated!

Don't confuse this restaurant with the one in Ahwatukee--they're nothing alike, thank goodness.  This place is located in the ASU Tempe campus area but is blessedly *not* a student hang out.  Since Chef Payton came on board recently, the quality of the food has gone from mostly good to consistently very good.  My only qualm (and it's a small one) is the three-dollar shared plate charge.  I find such fees incredibly tacky.  The bar has always been great--excellent selection of wines (including those by the glass), very good happy hour prices.  Between 5pm and 7:30, the smallish bar area fills up with faculty and local business folks, so if you're hoping to grab a seat, come early. Alas, my favorite bartenders Matty and Jamie are no longer working there (the former moved to Postino, the latter out-of-state), but Ian is still on board and the other bartenders *seem* to be good, if not as interesting.  The last time I was there, one of the bartenders had to find another one to make my drink (a very simple champagne cocktail), so I think they still have some training to do.  I haven't come for the Saturday INDULJ party brunches, which look incredibly pretentious (as its name would suggest) and cheesy.  The event bills itself as something to get dressed up for, but if you look at the photos on their FB page, you'll notice that the guys in attendance think that wifebeaters, tee shirts, jeans and sunglasses covers that.  That's okay, though, because the target audience for the event seems to be about 10 years younger than I am. (so I'm probably just being old and snobby)  All in all, I generally love coming here after work.  Have a glass or three of wine, enjoy a half-price appetizer and some interesting chats with other guests.

Just to clarify: this review is for the Elliot Rd. restaurant in Ahwatukee. The only way I can make sense of the glowing reviews here is to conclude that those diners don't get out much or they're friends with the owner. They also obviously really appreciate that the staff pays attention to regulars (who wouldn't?).  However, in the past four years, I've eaten here probably a dozen times, and experience was such a let down that months would go by before my husband and I would say, "Eh, let's give it another shot."  Okay, no more.   Everything about this restaurant is consistently inconsistent.  The service is friendly but inevitably the server screws up our order.  The ingredients seem thoughtfully chosen but the preparation is way off (overcooked, undercooked, something left off of the plate, etc).  One of our dishes may be really good and the other barely okay.  Even the space is confused.  Half of the dining room faces the bar, so diners are forced to deal with whatever game they have the giant TV tuned into.  I don't know about everyone else, but I don't usually pay $75 for a bottle of wine at a sports bar. Which leads me to the wine.  By the glass? Forget it.  The offerings are no better than what you'd find at a nice pizza joint.  Bottle offerings are pretty unforgettable, too, and I get the sense that the owner is counting on his patrons not realizing that they're paying too much for what they get.  Much of the wine list looks like it's taken straight from the shelves at the local Fry's market.  But why would I want to drink Rex Goliath, Rodney Strong, Bogle or even Lindeman's at a restaurant that bills itself as a "Euro-style bistro and wine bar"? It's true that the dining experiences in Ahwatukee are mostly limited to chain restaurants and modest mom-and-pop joints, so it's nice to see someone trying to up the ante. Now if only Caffe Boa would actually do so...  One more note: I know there's an ongoing grudge between this restaurant and the Mill Ave. establishment of the same name.  I'm familiar enough with both to say this: the Mill Ave. restaurant far exceeds this one in terms of ambiance, food and wine.  Alas, it is also run by someone notorious for not treating his employees very well.  I've never heard one bad thing about this Caffe Boa's management.

Love Shady's.  It's a small space with an interesting crowd, excellent bartenders and liquor selection.  Check out the jukebox.  This would be my neighborhood hangout, if I lived in this part of town.

This was my first visit back at the Clarendon since 2006, when the hotel had recently changed owners, and I was really excited about going back.   Much has improved since then, particularly the space (room decor, public areas--pool and rooftop, even the elevator) and the on-site restaurant.  The Clarendon still has very friendly service and decent amenities.  I also appreciate the little touches like having an iPod dock on the clock radio, Philosophy soap and lotion, low-allergen rooms, etc.  However, the hotel has some real liabilities.  One is the noise.  Good god in heaven, don't stay on a weekend night unless you want to be kept up until 4 a.m by people drinking in the outside hallways.  I expected noise from the pool area until midnight, as that's when it closes, but after that, the hotel staff needs to pay attention to what its guests are up to outside of their rooms.  Several times during the wee hours, I looked out my window to count how many people were outside drinking.  Sometimes four or five, an hour later, ten or twelve.  *sigh*  Another problem is the $20 "service fee" which covers parking, wifi, unlimited local/long distance calls, gym access, two bottles of water, "free late-night munchies minibar," a Keurig machine in room,  morning paper and four pool passes.  The owners of the Clarendon argue that parking and wifi alone would cost that much at other downtown hotels 1. While It IS true that resorts around here charge a 20-dollar resort fee, and some downtown hotels charge up to $18 per night for parking, that usually means access to an actual resort and valet service with your car in a garage, someone to help with your bags, etc..  As for wifi, typically, hotels downtown catering to business travelers (ie. most of the hotels downtown) provide that service for free; if not, the guest has the choice of paying for it or not. And the wifi at this hotel is sloooow.  2. At the Clarendon, a covered parking spot is not guaranteed (we had one when we checked in, but when we left around 7 pm to go to the store--see below--, the covered spaces were all taken upon our return), but you still have to schlep your bags inside and up to your room yourself (and I saw no baggage cart in the lobby).  When it's 100+ degrees outside, trust me, these things make a difference.  3. I doubt many guests actually take advantage of the room phone, since most folks these days have a cell phone. 4. The small bottles of water were your garden-variety cheap stuff, and the in-room Keurig?  It came with only two coffee pods (the others were decaf and tea), paper cups, Sweet 'n Low (hello, cancer warning) and "non-dairy" creamer.  Seriously.  Even the cashier at that Fresh 'N Easy up the street where we went to buy a couple of coffee mugs to use said, "At the Clarendon?? How un-gay!"  We all laughed at that one. But seriously.  4. How are the munchies "free" if you're paying for them with this service fee?  And 5. The promised morning paper and four pool passes never materialized, nor were we told anything at check-in about the gym access.  In any case, we couldn't enjoy the pool because it was literally PACKED with 20-somethings whooping it up from the moment we checked in. And it's certainly no "sea of tranquility" after dark, either.  Now, I should add here that my stay last weekend was free (I won a night via a FB contest), and I was really looking forward to a romantic evening with my guy.  That's not really how it went.  *If* I had been paying, I would have been seriously pissed off at being kept up all night by rude guests and paying for amenities that either should actually be free, cost less or be worth the expense.  So my advice to people considering staying at the Clarendon is this: during pool season, stay away unless you're okay with a LOT of noise.  But if you're under 30 and looking for a party, you could do worse than to stay here on a weekend night.  It's a cool place full of hip people.  It's like Hotel Congress in Tucson, but with flat-screen TVs and slick decor.

This review is for the Foothills/Casa Paloma location in Chandler. If I was just rating my stylist, Kelly Reid, I'd give five stars.  She is fantastic at what she does, and it's always a pleasure to sit in her chair.  She does beautiful work (I get nothing but compliments on my hair).  On the other hand, I find the salon's style itself not to my tastes.  It's a bit lacking in personality, or maybe just trying too hard to appeal to ladies that lunch.  That said, the front desk staff is very friendly and the product lines are top notch.  I have no complaints about how the salon is run. Overall, well worth the money for the level of service.  I have never left there disappointed and continue to recommend Kelly to all of my friends.

After doing lots of research into Miele vacuums (online and in local stores), I wound up purchasing my top-of-the-line Capricorn canister vac here.  I knew exactly what I wanted and brought with me a list of accessories and best prices I had found online. Jackie was great to work with--she matched the deals I had found AND threw in one of the pieces for free because I would have to return a day later to pick everything up (some things had to be brought over from another Valley location). Because of her willingness to close the deal, I was able to save about $200 dollars.   The sale included an extra year on the parts warranty and two years of free maintenance.  This on top of Miele's seven-year motor warranty. As I said, I shopped around locally before coming here, and from the minute I stepped inside 35th Ave, I knew I was in a great place.  There was no pressure, just great service. If my vacuum is ready on time, I will return and bump up the rating to a five. ps.  This store is mostly a sewing machine and fabrics dealer, and I was so impressed with what I saw (gorgeous selection of batiks) that I'm considering signing my daughter up for sewing lessons there this summer.

Delicious food, great service and inviting dining room!  My husband, six year-old daughter and I just tried Kabab Palace last night after having read a positive review in the AZ Republic.  (Glad I saw that review, because the uninspired name and strip-mall location alone would not have tempted me.)  This is no ethnic dive, so don't go expecting a cramped space with dirt cheap food.  Instead, what you will find is a nicely decorated dining room with real tables and chairs (and linens), a full bar, and professional, friendly service. Although we have experience with Afghan cuisine (hello, Helmand in Baltimore--we miss you!), we mostly encouraged the owner to make suggestions for us.  Good idea!  Our starters, the aushak (ravioli) and kaddo (a roasted pumpkin dish) were too good--I had intended to just sample but the sauces were so fabulous, we scraped the plates clean with pieces of bread.  When our entrees arrived, I was already stuffed.   Still, I had to try everything and wasn't disappointed.  Even my daughter's simple chicken (Murgh) kababs were hard to resist--the meat was charred beautifully yet perfectly moist inside.  The cilantro chutney accompanied it well.  My prime rib was tender, fragrant and seriously tasty with the red pepper chutney.   The husband's Dwopiaza lamb must have been fantastic, too--it disappeared quickly!  I did scoop up some of his challow (rice) with the leftover sauce.  Delicious. Our sides included spinach (subzi) and the pureed yellow split peas (daal).  The spinach was simply prepared but very fresh tasting.  The daal was complex, with just the right amount of heat. For dessert, I wanted the homemade mango ice cream but, in a failed attempt to get my picky child to try something new, ordered rice pudding topped with cardamom and pistachios.  Oh well, more for me!  I highly recommend that you try this restaurant for dinner.  It is the sort of place to take people you would enjoy sharing a leisurely meal with.  And while the 10 dollar lunch buffet appears to be popular, too, you cannot expect the freshest of the kitchen to be found on a steam table.  That said, I believe we'll head back soon for lunch, too!

Note: this is for the Indian restaurant located in the former Afghan restaurant.  Also, to clarify, there is NO alcohol served here now.  I was very sad when the Afghan owners sold their restaurant--the food was fabulous.  That said, I love southern Indian food and was pleased the first few times I ate here under the new ownership, even though they had NO chutneys, lime pickles, etc on or off the menu. Sadly, the quality has been sliding down with each visit.  When I went this week with my family, the meal started badly and continued that way.  The pappads were awful, stale.  When I informed the waitress, she went in the back, then returned saying, "Oh, we tried to keep them crispy but the kitchen must be too humid."  She didn't take ours back or offer us an appetizer.  Instead, they sat there on the table, untouched, until we requested that she take them back to the kitchen.  For the rest of the night, I listened to her warn guests that the pappads were a bit "off."  Good grief.  Still, we didn't come for the pappads, so onward.   As usual, we ordered a LOT of food: chicken and paneer pakoras, poori chana, butter chicken, lamb vindaloo, and more.  Alas,  everything seemed like reheated leftovers.  Not horrible but certainly not what I expect when I pay someone else to cook for me. It's not every Indian restaurant that serves dishes like dosa, utappam and idlis, so I'm sad to see what could be a good restaurant going down the road to mediocrity.  Next time, I'll drive the extra ten minutes and go to Dhaba.

I've eaten at La Bocca on countless occasions and figured it was past time that I posted a review.  This restaurant is a fairly safe bet if you're looking for tasty food, relaxed atmosphere and a good selection of wine.  Some of what they do is terrific (especially the pizza), other things less so.  The service is always friendly but is inconsistent in terms of quality. On my most recent visit (two nights ago), my boyfriend and I split a salad and a pizza, plus a bottle of wine, which was half price (Monday night deal).  The bill totaled $42.00, which I consider very reasonable for what we got. Here's how our visit went: We were first seated at a very unfortunately located two-top, crammed next to the large serving board that dominates the dining space.  I probably would've overlooked that, but the table was also far too close to another one that was occupied.  I sat down and literally had no room to move without bumping into the diner behind me.  Since there was another two-top along the banquette seating, I asked our server if we could move.  Luckily for us, he said yes.  But I was still annoyed that the hostess put us there in the first place, since there were clearly better seating options available.  Strike one against the service.  My mood improved when I was reminded about the half-price wine that night.  I don't usually order an entire bottle when there's just two of us (yes, we could easily drink the entire thing, but one of us was going to need to drive afterwards), but when I calculated how much it would cost us for the two martinis we'd been considering, the half-price wine made more sense.  Our server suggested I might like two of the whites, and when I requested, he happily brought us a taste of each.  We went with a pretty good albariño, which normally runs $35 a bottle.  ($22-25 would be a more appropriate price, so if you're going to try this one, do so on a Sunday or Monday.)  Side note: the wine service was really odd and inconsistent. First, we'd clearly just tasted the wine, so pouring a taste and then offering it to my boyfriend was just ridiculous, not to mention insulting because I'm the one who knows about wine, AND I was the one buying dinner.  Seriously, these outdated, sexist rituals have to go. Also, I'm glad they provide a chiller, but it's weird for the server to recap the bottle after pouring the wine.  If there'd been a cork, he naturally wouldn't have even tried to.  It was also odd that the he stopped by once to refill my boyfriend's glass, but for the rest of the meal, it was up to me to refill our glasses. Strike two.  The salad I ordered was the "harvest chop."  I have no idea why the kitchen decided that a sprinkling of tubetti pasta on top would add anything--it doesn't.  The little tubes add no flavor, color or texture, so...?  Nonetheless, it is a very tasty salad; the mustard vinaigrette is delicious (although the kitchen needs to be more careful about not overdressing the greens--ours were practically drowned).  Another thing about the salads: the menu says that the restaurant will happily "split" one for an extra 4 dollars.  I didn't intend to split mine and was worried when it arrived from the kitchen with two plates.  So I was relieved later to see no such charge on my bill, even though my boyfriend did wind tasting it, since they gave him a plate.  I'd barely begun my salad when someone from the kitchen arrived with our pizza.  This is what *should* have happened: he holds the pizza in the kitchen until we've finished the first course.  OR he gets to the table but then apologizes and offers to hold the pizza.  Instead, the young man just stood there looking at us, as if we were supposed  to clear a space on the table.  Seriously?  Strike three.  So my boyfriend moved the salad dish and his plate, while I said, "We clearly are not ready to be served the next course yet."  Almost instantly, however, our main server rushed over to apologize and offered to hold the pizza until we're ready.  I replied, "No point.  It's already on the table."  Now, you may think that I'm being a bit harsh, but the truth is, this was a major service mistake.  At PIzza Hut, I'd expect that kind of cluelessness.  Not at La Bocca.  After this, I paid very close attention to see how long it took for someone to clear the salad bowl once I'd emptied it.  The pizza, thank heavens, was outstanding.  We'd ordered the sicily (schreiner's sicilian sausage, sundried tomatoes, parmesan and goat cheese, shallots, xvoo, herbs).  I generally prefer my crust to be thin and crackley around the edges; this one was puffier and chewier, but I still loved it.  We passed on dessert, although we had a good laugh with our server over the silly and confusing "banana fosters."    So we enjoyed our meal and won't hesitate to eat there again.  I'm just lowering my expectations regarding the service.  Sign of the times, alas.

We went here for the first time because of the Groupon offer.  I cannot believe that in the four years I've worked at nearby ASU that I haven't been here before!  The space and service is warm and inviting.  But it's the food that will have us coming back.  Fresh, delicious, you can tell that they toast and grind their own spices.  My daughter always orders chicken pakora, which I usually find very blah, but at Dhaba it was fabulous--moist, tender white meat fried perfectly in a light crispy batter with just the right amount of spice.  And the paneer pakora was even better.  From the appetizers (try the bhatura chole!) onward, our meal was the best we've had in any Indian restaurant in the SE valley so far.  Oh, and it's a plus that they have white wines by the glass that compliment the food.

I first learn of this place while at Lifetime Fitness, where I met SS employee Flash at an event.  He gave me a 10% discount card, and I was considering getting more serious about running, so I thought, "Why not?"   Flash was working that day, and helped me get the correct shoes.  He did a video gait analysis (I'm pleased to note that I don't have knock knees or pigeon toes or run like freak).  I tried on a series of shoes, each time running up and down the sidewalk outside to determine what felt best.  I went with Asics Gel Nimbus, and I can't live without the now.  :-)  Thanks, Flash. I have to admit, I was pretty nervous going in--I like exercising but I'm no jock.  I feared that I would find myself face-to-face with a bunch of running snobs who would make me feel like an idiot.  Happily, I promise you will not have such an experience here.   I recently returned to bring in my stepdaughter, too,  who has also decided to take up running.  She had a similarly excellent experience, and I am sure that she'll get great use out of her new Mizunos.   Now, if only I had the money to buy my running clothes here, too.

I went with AZ Interlocks because it was the only company on Yelp that didn't have a bunch of negative reviews. So glad I did, because so far, the service has been terrific, and the device is super easy to use--just blow for four seconds. No sucking; no humming. (I've only had it for about a month, so I'll update my review later at the end of my contract.) I go to the Tempe location.  Including tax, I pay 80 bucks a month and have no fears of getting nickeled and dimed to death by hidden fees (btw, if any company tries to lure you by saying, "But we don't charge an installation fee," move along. NO one charges an installation fee--it's a BS sales tactic.)

During my most recent visit to Citizen Public House, I sat at the bar with a friend and sampled several dishes from the late night menu. We had initially planned to wash down a bowl of Tender Belly bacon fat popcorn with our outstanding drinks (Richie Moe and his bar staff are the finest I know--but that's for a different show).  The popcorn was, as always, a real treat.  Crispy, fragrant, savory, salty goodness.  But then the gentleman beside us was served a pork belly pastrami, and the amazing smell was driving us crazy. So we placed an order for that and Chef Bernie's Original Chopped Salad (which he first introduced while at the helm of Cowboy Ciao and which I also find I cannot resist).  The pastrami is made of melt-in-your-mouth pork belly, and the sauerkraut provided a terrific tangy balance to the richness of the meat.  Typically, the menu at Citizen is stocked with dishes that are familiar but have their own particular twist.  In this case, the sauerkraut was made of Brussels sprouts instead of cabbage. And rather than pile the combination between two slices of rye, it was served with fantastic rye spaetzle (I learned to cook these dumplings in Germany, so I am usually leery of ordering them in American restaurants--but Citizen's were outstanding.  Chewy but still tender.)  After we finished the pastrami (and restrained ourselves from licking the plate), we dug into the salad.  It arrived on the platter in carefully arranged in rows (basically, a salade composée) of Israeli couscous, chopped arugula, tomatoes, smoked salmon, toasted pepitas, and Asiago cheese.  The dressing, which comes on the side, is a sort of slightly-garlicky Green Goddess, very fresh and light.  The friendly gentleman serving us offered to toss the salad.  It seemed a shame to destroy the lovely arrangement, but this is definitely an instance where making a mishmash on your plate is the way to go.  None of the ingredients lost their integrity, but the combination of flavors (sweet, salty, smoky, green) and textures was outstanding.  The crunch of the pepitas with the crispy greens and delicate couscous is as close to salad heaven as a girl can get.   I love desserts but rarely order them at restaurants because it's a course that can be pretty iffy.  However, I know that Tracy Dempsey does amazing work for Citizen, so I had to take a look at the evening's offerings.  I saw chicory ice cream and salted chocolate caramel sauce with chicory streusel, and any remaining self-restraint went out the window.   What a winner--again, excellent contrast of sweet and savory, perfect portion size for two to share.  My only quibble, and a minor one at that, was with the ice cream, which could've used a bigger boost of chicory.  But then again, not everyone loves chicory coffee as I do.  I'd be remiss in not discussing the actual space of the restaurant.  It would be fairly easy to pass Citizen by on the street; it fairly disappears into the bland exterior of a white building on the corner of 5th and Craftsman in Old Towne Scottsdale.  The signage, above the entrance on Craftsman, is not easily seen after dark. In fact, when standing out front once, I was stopped by a couple who asked me if I knew where the restaurant was.  The interior, while understated, is far from nondescript.  The center of the dining room is dominated by a large, stainless steel bar and the vaulted ceiling above with its exposed beams.  Seating options include freestanding tables for four, leather banquettes along two walls, an alcove that accommodates larger dining parties, and my favorite, the very comfortable barstools.  The color scheme is very simple--white walls with dark accents and clusters of artwork hung gallery style.  Still, there is no shortage of warmth in the room.  The staff is exceedingly welcoming and the service professional but friendly.  On peak nights, the acoustics of the space mean that it can get a bit loud, but noise fits right in with the idea that you are in a contemporary "public house."  Citizen's combination of a lively dining room with an outstanding, innovative menu, top-notch bar and superb service will keep bringing me back.  Side note: some people seem to be confused about the difference between a "public house" and a sports bar.  If you want to watch television while you drink, I suggest you seek out the latter, as Citizen mercifully has no TVs.

First, let's get this clear: Los Dos is *not* a "Mexican" restaurant.  It is "New Mexican."  So if you're expecting whatever your idea of Mexican food is, you'll be confused and disappointed.  No soft tacos, no fish tacos, no big piles of tomato and lettuce with a side of sour cream.  Even the chips and salsa are different--the chips are thicker and crunchier, and the salsa is thin.  And there is no *mild* salsa.    I do not recommend this place for vegetarians,  nor is it for folks who don't like spicy food.  I also do not recommend their margaritas, unless you're okay with paying 10 bucks for a weak, too-sweet drink--to be fair, I like my margaritas the real, old-school way: tequila, triple sec, lime juice.  That's it.   But beer lovers should find something they'll like.  If you're smart, you'll steer clear of the pedestrian fare on the a la cart and combo menus and order from the "chef's specials" section.  I highly recommend the chile relleno with adovada and the chile plate with machaca.  Of course, you can customize several of the dishes by selecting whichever meat you want--chicken, adovada, machaca, etc. The only non-spicy option here is the carnitas, which I never order because I love the adovada too much to pass up on it.  The plates come with beans (very good) and rice (okay), and the servings are huge. The tortillas served on the side are thick, chewy and the perfect vehicle for sopping up all the spicy, gooey goodness on your plate.  I always end up needing a to-go box, which I invariably send home with my partner--one "cheat" a week is plenty, thanks!  The servers have always been friendly on my visits.  Last night, we had a very sweet young man who was as attentive as we would want.  The kitchen and the bar can be slow, though.  So don't expect to get in and out quickly.  The only thing that I totally disapprove of is the way the bill is sometimes presented.  Depending on how busy they are, sometimes the waiter brings you an iPad sort of device, and then stands there while you sign your bill.  I don't have an issue with going digital.  My problem is that the screen basically demands that you select from one of three pre-set tip amounts--I think it's 18, 20 and 22%.  I find that incredibly tacky, presumptuous and very awkward, since the server is standing there, waiting for you to finish with the device.   So I hope that the owners of this location are listening: Some of your guests may not know how to calculate a tip, but please don't insult those of us who do.  Do not impose upon our judgement of the service.  If you're *really* worried about your servers being screwed over by angry/cheap customers, make sure your employees do their jobs well, and/or pay them better.  Thanks.

I went last Saturday for the first time while celebrating a friend's birthday, and it was an all-around lousy experience.  First of all, I find the whole "velvet rope" thing incredibly tacky, pretentious, childish, etc.  It's one thing to be "at capacity" and another entirely to treat potential customers as if they were in a cattle call.  One member of our group, a male, was let in immediately because he knew the door man.  The rest of us stood in line for 30-some minutes. Setting aside how very rude it was for that "friend" of the birthday girl to ditch her like that rather than insisting she be admitted with him, it was clear that the door man was lying through his teeth about the place being full.  When I called him on it, he said, "I can only let girls in now--we have too many guys inside."  Wait, what? It was not as if we were dressed inappropriately for a night club--we'd just come the rooftop at the W, for pete's sake (another place I've no intention of frequenting by choice)  To add insult to injury, my boyfriend and I were DYING to go to use a restroom.  Of course, two minutes after we stepped out of line to see if we could find one, the rest of our group got in.  No way in hell was I going to stand in that line all over again, but the dick at the door couldn't have cared less.  Luckily, the folks waiting at the front (who had been behind us earlier) took pity and let us get in front of them. Eventually the door guy got tired of hearing me say, "Look, you already let our party in" and let us in. Once inside, I thought, "Jesus, what do all of these people see in this place?"  Whoever designed the space has clearly confused gaudy for classy--ironically--given the name of the joint, everything looked really cheap, and the employees' dress didn't match the image I believe the Mint aspires to.  Oh, and I forgot to mention that we had to pay ten bucks just to get in.  And after all of that crap, we had to leave five minutes later because one of our friends felt ill. (No wonder)   In sum, I'd say The Mint epitomizes everything about Snottsdale that people rightly mock.  If your sense of self depends on being cool enough to get past a velvet rope, then you'll be in good company at this place.

Best food I've ever had at a pub.  Outrageously good burgers and salads.

I'm a Southern girl who grew up eating Carolina-style pulled pork BBQ and has spent years in the Phoenix area trying and failing to find the good stuff. Well, at last my search has ended! Folks, if you want the best pulled-pork and coleslaw sandwich west of the Mississippi, look no farther! No gross mouthfuls of fat, this BBQ is lean, moist and has just the right amount of smoke. And I absolutely love the tangy, mouthwatering sauce. The combination of soft bun, crispy coleslaw and tender pork is really heaven. And better still, you can also enjoy an excellent glass of wine (yes, my friends, there are several wines that go great with pork BBQ) and friendly, knowledgeable service.  My only complaint is that Tom's Thumb Fresh Market is a loooong haul from my house in the Ahwatukee Foothills. But that's probably a good thing, or I'd be eating here several times a week!

I love the staff (super friendly and genuinely interested in their clients), very clean, comfortable salon. The prices are on par with other businesses I've been to.  Just a heads up, though--they can get really busy, so if you don't have some time to kill, it's best to call ahead (even if it's only 30 minutes notice) and book an appointment.

I'm happy to see that a business seems to finally be making it in this location after so many have failed. Ahwatukee, the Foothills in particular, is in dire need of more dining options that aren't pizza or a chain.  As a rule, I avoid new restaurants until they've had a couple of months to iron out the kinks, but I'd been hearing good things about Perfect Pear for a while, so last night, my daughter and I went for dinner. I really wish that I could say that I'm excited to return, but in truth, I probably won't dine there again.  We encountered the first glitch of the evening as soon as we entered. No one was at the front to greet us, nor was there a sign indicating that we should seat ourselves. So for five minutes, we stood there by the entrance feeling a bit foolish. I passed the time by looking at the laminated menu (which gave me pause--I understand the practical aspects of lamination, but, gosh, they really evoke places like Dennys, not a restaurant that clearly is trying to be much more than that). While we waited for someone to direct us, I made eye contact with someone working in the partially open kitchen, but he just ignored us. I told the young lady who eventually seated us that it was our first visit, and that I had no idea whether or not we were supposed to seat ourselves.  I don't think she took my point.  To my relief, our server arrived almost immediately to take our drink orders. Yay!  The menu is limited to starters, salads, pasta and sandwiches, which seems perfectly in line for a bistro, and each category has good variety of offerings. On our server's recommendation, I ordered the Tukee Pear quesadilla to begin the meal.  It came out to the table fairly quickly and was really big. And delicious looking--the tortilla was perfectly crisped and puffed up and contained just the right amount of its filling of pear, bacon, arugula and pepper jack. It was so good, I even convinced my ultra-picky child to try it. The spicy dipping sauce (sour cream-based, I believe) complemented it nicely.  So our meal was off to a really good start.  For my dinner, again on the server's recommendation, I ordered the Wild Chop salad made with their baby green blend (kale, spinach, arugula) with salmon added. I should add here that I LOVE salad. In fact, it's kind of my litmus test for restaurants. I don't care how good the rest of the meal is, if the salad--even just a house side--is some depressing affair thrown together like an afterthought, then whoever is running the kitchen isn't paying attention to the details. That never bodes well.  When the salad *is* the meal, you should expect that just as much care goes into it as any other dish.  This salad landed with an absolute thud. Sadly, the two smallish pieces of salmon were so overcooked, desiccated and hard. This poor fish had been done a grave injustice. Still, I decided to give the rest of the salad a try before throwing in the towel.  I suspect that whoever made my salad doesn't much care for them. What a mess. The greens on top were dry, making me wonder if someone forgot to dress them. There also appeared to be no thought put into the composition of the dish--the greens were randomly topped with a tablespoon or two of plain quinoa, a few long pieces of soggy cucumber and roasted bell pepper, a sad lump of crumbled feta... I took a bite of the greens and couldn't taste any pesto dressing. When I dug down, though, I realized that it hadn't been left off after all--it was all just at the bottom, alas. So some of the salad was under-dressed and rest was drenched. At that point, I just put my fork down and said, "This is pitiful."  Meanwhile, my daughter was pigging out on the huge side of seriously good crinkle-cut sweet potato fries that came with her (not) Perfectly Grilled Cheese, which, like my salmon, was terribly overcooked. We could both see that one side of it was pretty charred, but, hey, charred bread can still be tasty. Just not this time. I don't know if the spiced pear bread was a little stale to begin with or if it just suffered during cooking, but the sandwich was really tough and dry. None of the ooey gooey lusciousness I'd expected. My daughter had gamely eaten one half, but abandoned it for the fries. It wasn't until I tried a bite that I realized how bad the sandwich actually was. I let her open up the remaining half and eat the cheese and bacon. I ate some of the bread, anyway, because I was hungry.  To the restaurant's credit, our server handled the salad problem gracefully, apologizing and removing it from the bill. I had a bowl of okay tomato soup instead. I didn't bother complaining about the sandwich, since most of it was eaten.   I'd hoped that the Perfect Pear would become my go-to neighborhood place for dinner. But I just don't have faith that the kitchen is paying attention to everything that comes out of it. That's a shame.

I've been to Unwined several times now, so I feel like I have a pretty good sense of what it's about.  If I could give it 2.5 stars, I would. It's between "meh" and "ok."  On my first visit, shortly after this place opened, I just came in to take a look and check out the bar. And I'll admit it, I have pretty high standards when it comes to drinks, but the woman who was bartending that night was awful. She acted like I was inconveniencing her when I ordered a Manhattan and couldn't tell me a thing about the "tincutures" used in the house cocktails (more on that later). So I ordered something simpler. However, because I haven't seen her working at the bar since that visit, I won't waste any more time on her.  The second time I visited, it was about 8:30 pm on a Tuesday night, and my friend and I were hungry. So we decided to give Unwined's food a try. The place was empty except for a couple drinking beer at the end of the bar, but I could see two employees by the register behind the bar, so we approached to ask if the kitchen was still open. No joke, it took almost five minutes before anyone acknowledged us. I know that the manager (I found out later who he was) saw us, but he said nothing until he was done at the register. Then he turned around and said, "Ok, what can we get you? Sorry for the wait, but I had to deal with *that*" (indicating the other employee). I found this man's aggrieved attitude pretty unprofessional, but the kitchen was open, and we were starved. So.   Our meal was a surprisingly good experience--my friend's Big Tukee burger was perfectly prepared and delicious. I gambled and ordered the Smoked Salmon cakes (I am really, really particular about my seafood).  They were also very good.  On this visit, I also decided to take a look at the wine menu; after all, Unwined refers to itself as "Ahwatukee's premier wine bar."  I was underwhelmed. But given the lack of good restaurants in the foothills area, it was a relief to know the food was good, even if the menu is very limited. So I knew I'd be back another time to try their other offerings.  So flash forward to mid-December (four weeks ago). I accompanied some friends to Unwined for dinner. They'd never been before, so I recommended the burger and the salmon cakes, for sure. I decided to try the warm kale salad.  Except for the salmon cakes, the meal was a bust. The burgers were way overcooked and dry (which made me embarrassed and disappointed for recommending them), and the kale salad made us laugh. It wasn't "warm" in the least, but the funny part was how enormous the pieces of kale were. I mean huge. As happens sadly often in restaurants, the salad appeared to be made by someone who doesn't even eat kale. My friends and I agreed that the vinaigrette was tasty, but I had to cut up all of the leaves up so I'd have a chance of getting one in my mouth. Honestly, I felt silly. We had fun catching up with one another, but none of our party is ready to go running back to Unwined to eat.  Remember my comment about the bad bartender and the tinctures? Now I get to the part about Unwined that really, really bugs me. First of all, they have no business trying to sell craft cocktails, because as far as I can tell, this place does not employ a qualified bartender. I am crazy about top-notch cocktails (Hello, Citizen Public House!), but I'm equally happy with a simple glass of Woodford. Unwined needs to either stick to the basics or invest in a real bartender--not the manager making weird Old Fashioneds, and whatever you do, don't order the Sazerac. It is downright terrible.    Now, I'm not exactly an oenophile, but I do know quite a bit about wine, the characteristics of varietals, etc. Let me just put it this way: the wine list here is unimaginative. For example, the whites by the glass--there are 14 of them BUT it's so pedestrian and formulaic. 3 cheap sparklers, 3 chardonnays, 3 sauvignon blancs, 2 pinot grigios. You get the picture. As another reviewer pointed out, the manager likes to put on a big show about "educating" his patrons about wine. Maybe he thinks we're kindergartners? *sigh* Even the reds were nothing to write home about. I can appreciate owners not wanting to lose money on uncorking an expensive bottle for what may only be one or two pours, but the selections here are either $5, $7 or $8, with one red at $9/glass. I love a great, inexpensive find as much as the next person, but every wine I've tried so far has been just ok, which is what I would expect, given these prices.  There's nothing wrong with "ok," but this place is pretending to be something it's not. The owners need to go hang out and take notes at places like Postino, Cheuvront, Kazimierz, 5th and Wine, Vintage 95, Terroir Wine Pub (especially the latter, since it's very close in spirit to Unwined), and so on. Until then, I fear that Unwined's reach will continue to exceed its grasp.
