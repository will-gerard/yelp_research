Radio Maria is trying a little too hard to be trendy, décor-wise--it's the kind of place you walk into and expect to be treated with a bit of a condescending attitude by the staff. But thankfully this was not the case! We made our way to the bar where we were greeted by a friendly barman who presented us with a very nice cocktail list while we waited for a table. I chose the Dark and Stormy, which was ridiculously delicious with fresh ginger grated into it! (I ended up having another that I really didn't need, just because it was so refreshingly awesome.) Unfortunately Radio Maria's website seems to be down currently and it was about two weeks ago that I went here on a trip out to Des Moines so my memory has faded as to the specifics of what we had, but we ordered off the tapas menu and everything was above average. I'd definitely return here on a trip to the Twin City area.

Wonderful! Hailing from the Midwest, I've always loved desert flora and fauna because it's so radically different from what I grew up with. A few hours at the Desert Botanical Garden really indulged my fascination. Grab a sunhat, a camera and set aside a few hours to wander the trails here. It's truly a delightful experience. Besides all the amazing plantlife, I saw myriad birds, a lizard, a jackrabbit and some other kind of tree rodent thing, though I sadly did not catch a glimpse of desert tortoise. I guess I'll just have to go back!

FLW FTW! If you have any interest in Frank Lloyd Wright, it's pretty much a no-brainer to take a trip to Taliesin West if you're in the area. I took the 90-minute tour and had an excellent guide, Dierdre, whose knowledge of FLW's life and works, as well as the minutiae of Taliesen West, made it a very informative visit. Well worth the $30+ price of admission.

If you don't want to go to bed drunk on an empty stomach while staying at the Valley Ho, I highly recommend the fries with the sriracha aoli! If you're still not drunk enough, order a dirty martini while you wait for your fries.

Vegan vittles have never tasted so good as they do at this bright cheery cafe. I went here on my birthday after reading Yelp reviews and was not disappointed. The waitress told us that the recipe for the sauce on the Dragon Bowl was a secret and it wasn't hard to figure out why--it was amazing! It tasted like the love child of tahini, sesame oil and several other things I'd love to identify. With a pile of veggies and rice, it was a party in my mouth! We also tried a Thai peanut salad with tempeh, which was also delicious, and their "Tonique"--a blend of apple, lemon and ginger juices. This was probably the best meal I've had in a long, long time. Why can't making healthy choices always taste this good? I plan to try and replicate the dragon sauce and Tonique at home, but it's hard to imagine my own efforts would stand up to the amazing Aux Vivres. The rest of their menu looked as enticing as what we had. I'd probably be in danger of going here 2-3 times per week if I lived in Montreal. Happy birthday to me!

This cute café on the outskirts of the main tourist area of old town actually seems like it's patronized by locals and regulars. This was a lovely place for lunch if you're in the mood for crepes. The ambiance was a little fancier than I expected, but it wasn't pretentious at all. My "Delicieux" crepe was excellent, with eggplant, cheese, tomato sauce and veggies. The other crepe we had was a bit over-the-top, with some kind of creamy cheese and veggies. I can't recall the name of it. You can choose salad or frites to accompany your crepe. Tip: If you order the frites, you'll still get a little salad as well. I was only disappointed in the fact that we didn't have room for the dessert crepe with Nutella, strawberries and bananas.

Cafe Monarch has atmosphere in spades and excellent food to match! Having just rolled into town for a work trip, we showed up before the day's menu had yet been written on the chalkboard. We were content to enjoy the serene ambiance over cups of cold water and a mug of chickory coffee as the chef chose the day's offerings and began prepping in the little kitchen that juts out into the dining area. The chef was friendly and fun, chatting with us and the other patrons that trickled in as the morning grew longer.   Of the four or so dishes, I chose a grilled cheese with gruyere and a tomato basil salad, my companion a salad with roasted pears and prosciutto. I can promise it's not hyperbole when I say that this was the most wonderful meal I've had in a long time! The tomatoes were divine, the basil abundant and I don't even know what was in the dressing, but it was amazing.   The greatest feature of this restaurant--besides the delicious food--is the chef, who is also host and server. He gave me a little tag with a butterfly stamped in blank ink as a souvenir on my way out the door. How could he know this is just the type of thing I save in little boxes or tuck into books to remember my excursions?   I also enjoyed the charming decor with its the blue-tinted Ball jars, casement windows and pewter plates mounted on the wall. It felt a little French provincial--cozy and casual, yet elegant. Truly, there's some kind of magic about Cafe Monarch, which you'll have to discover yourself.

I didn't expect to hear people speaking French in Arizona, but I also didn't know I'd wind up at the Sandwich Club. Lavazza espresso--just like a Parisian cafe! It's all "madamoiselle" and "monsieur" and "voila" at this simple, cheery restaurant. Excellent savory crepes--mozerella and basil, goat cheese and tomato. The spinach salad (sans bacon) was also very nice. We returned for a sweet crepe with Nutella and bananas. You could probably put Nutella on a shingle and I'd love it, but I digress. This appears to be a family operation, with the father and son standing out front, soliciting patrons like carnival barkers, while mama makes the crepes. I could be totally wrong about the familial relationships, though. Either way: bon appetit!

Wow, could Enterprise make its business model any more excruciating for the customer? The whole experience of renting a car from this Enterprise was something akin to interacting for an extended period of time with children dressed up in suits, playing business. Okay, maybe not children, but imagine that annoying kid on your high school debate team who talked incessantly about his plans to attend Georgetown law school even though he was only 16. That was my Enterprise representative. He actually reached across the counter to shake my hand, asked me probing questions about the nature of my trip and made sexist remarks about the fact that I was traveling for work.   Anyway, Enterprise appears to mistakenly believe that its customers will welcome scripted faux-friendly chitchat with its silly employees, an excessive amount of paperwork and being forced to combat pressure to buy various insurance policies and upgrade, even when it's obviously unnecessary. UGH.   All that said, the little Nissan or whatever they gave me was fine for a few little trips around town and I had no hassles returning the car.
