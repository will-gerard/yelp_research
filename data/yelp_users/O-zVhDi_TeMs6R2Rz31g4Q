LOVE LOVE LOVE James Elliot Jewelry!!!! My fianc√© and I looked at engagement rings for years before I found the THE ONE.  It is literally the most beautiful piece of jewelry I have ever seen. I get complements on my ring almost every day and I always reccomend James Elliot. I also have a pair of really gorgeous earrings I just got a few months ago. They are a blaze cut, which is something I have never seen before in any other jewelry store. His designs are so exquisite and timeless. I can't wait to add more pieces to my jewelry collection. Even if you arnt looking for anything you should go and check out the store. Its so much fun going in there and just looking at all the sparkly jewelry.

Green is probably the best vegan restaurant in all of Arizona. The tsoynamis are AMAZING and their vegan "Ranch" dressing is the best I have ever had!! Most of the time when I go the lines are kind of long, but not too bad, Definitely worth the wait!!

I Love Heidi Boutique!! They have the cutest stuff and are always getting new product in. The prices are a little high, I can usually get the same designers/brands for a little cheaper at Juicy Couture, Nordstrom or other stores, But they are not too bad.   The only reason I am not giving them 5 stars is because they are either very friendly and helpful when I come in, or they are rude and do not even acknowledge me when I go in there. Customer Service is a huge thing with me, so normally I would give them a lot lower score for this, but since I Love their stuff so much I will give them a 4!! I would recommend more sales and specials!!

I am a very loyal customer to pure sushi and have been for over 2 years now. Up until about 6 months ago I would have given this place 4, possibly 5 stars, but with the horrible service I have encountered the last 6 months I'm only giving it 2. Normally I order my food to go at the bar and just take it home and eat it. But the for the last 6 months when I go in to order my food at the bar, its always the same bar tender working and she is rude. The last 3 times I have been into order food I ended up just walking out and not ordering anything. She is always taking to what seems to be her friends at the bar. I always know what I want right when I go in, so there is no need for a menu, she greets me and hands me a menu totally ignoring me telling her that I already knew what I wanted. Then she precedes to talk to her "friend" or whoever at the bar for 15 minutes before taking my order. I know all of her personal business and even what she plans on wearing to her friends wedding in a few weeks. The food is good, but considering there are so many other really great sushi places with so much better customer services i would not recommend this place at all. Now I totally understand if this happens once in a while, but it has happened every time I have gone in there for the past 6 months. I feel almost as if I were betrayed, I was such a loyal customer and referred so many people to Pure, I just hope they don't receive the same kind of service I do.

The fried imperial rolls and the fried rice are pretty good. The last time I went in there the guy told me that there are a few of their items that arnt actually vegan, so if you are looking for something vegan make sure you ask. Its not the best vegan food ive had, but its still pretty good!!

I went to bronze a few months ago with a friend in hopes of a nice manicure/pedicure. Lets just say that this was anything but relaxing. The person doing my friends nails kept answering his phone and the lady who was doing mine was rude, rough and made me bleed on several of my nails. My nails were very sore for about 4 or 5 days after getting them done.  I got the gel nails which consisted of several coats of polish and then for the glitter part, it was Martha Stewart glitter that you can purchase from a Wal-Mart or target, and then several more coats of polish. When it came time to removing the polish, I had to chip off the polish, like you have to do with fake nails. My nails hurt and were very weak for about a week after I removed the polish.  When I called to explain my experience to the Manager, he said that they would send me a gift card do try and "make it right". I waited about 3 weeks and never received the gift card, so I called back again and had to explain the whole thing again. Finally I received the gift card in the mail, but was surprised to find that it must have been a used gift card. There was an amount written out and then crossed off with a new amount written on it. It was very unprofessional.  The only good thing about this place is its location, right across from Barneys and next to sprinkles. I recommended this place to a few people before I had even gone there, I sure hope their experience wasn't anything like mine!!!!

Love Love Love this place!! I go to babycakes and other vegan bakeries in California and Treehouse Bakery is soooo much better than all of those. They have a wide variety of flavors and my fiance (who is not a vegan) even loves their stuff. They are even way better than non vegan cupcakes!!   My favorite is the red velvet cupcake!! I HIGHLY recommend you try it!!!!

I went here a few months ago, well I guess when they first opened, whenever that was (the fall of 2010 maybe). Anyways I am a vegan so asked about their vegan options. They said that pretty much everything was made with lard (I didnt know that people really still used that) but they said that they had a vegan burrito. I was assured that there wasnt any kind of un-vegan ingredients (such as cheese) in it. I ordered the vegan burrito with much skepticism. Once I got home and got about half way through the burrito I got a big mouth full of CHEESE!!   I was so upset because I was assured that it was vegan and did not come with cheese. But even worse,  I think that they started putting cheese on the burrito and then realized that it was supposed to be the vegan burrito with no cheese and they just kind of picked what cheese they could off and left the cheese that they couldnt easily pick off on there. I am not positive thats what happened but im pretty sure.  Anyways aside from the fact that they REALLY messed up my order, the burrito was just okay. It was really pretty greasy. My fiance on the other hand seems to enjoy this place, he gave it 4 stars. He said that it is a good place for greasy mexican, and on Wednesdays you can get a huge burrito for only 5 dollars.

My fiance and I drove all the way out from North Scottsdale just to try this place for lunch today. I was NOT impressed. The salad bar/food bar looked like food that had been sitting out all day and the Falafel bar looked disgusting and had little nats or some kind of bug all over the food. The people working there were nice and friendly and the food was pretty good. I would go here again (if I were in the area, I wont ever make a special trip out there just to eat there) but I will NEVER eat anything from the salad bar or the falafel bar.

First of all, if you are a vegan they don't understand what a vegan is. The manager asked me if I wanted to try the horseradish sauce, I asked him if it was vegan and he said "yeah there's no meat in it" I asked him what all was in it and he said, sour cream, horse radish and mayo. I said, oh well thats not vegan then, and he once again said, yeah it is there is no meat in it. I told him that dairy, such as sour cream and mayo is not vegan. He said oh and walked away. They said that their buns and the veggie burger were also vegan, but I would not trust them.  I had the sweet potato fries which were okay. The smell when I was in there was okay, because it is a coal oven it has kind of a different smell. But when I got home I knew there was going to be problems. The smell of the coal oven got on my clothes, skin and hair. It stunk so bad I had to immediately take a shower. Even after taking a shower and sleeping for 8 hours, it still stunk so bad that I had to take another shower right away when I woke up. My clothes stunk so bad that I had to wash them twice.   The friends that I went with said that their burgers were just okay. The service however was very good. It was their grand opening day so we had alot of people approaching our table asking about the food. It was a little hard to carry on a conversation with everybody interrupting  us, but I understand that it was their first day and they were just eager to see how we liked it. I would never go back just because I dont want that awful smell on me or my clothes again, and the fact that I am a vegan. However the customer service was so good that I will recommend this place to others, with a warning of the smell.

My only complaint is that they only have brunch on Sundays.

Loved the 3 day juice cleanse. Their salads and bowls are SOOOO good. They are 8-10 dollars for a pretty big portion of the freshest healthiest food out there.  Make sure to try the strawberry warrior milk and teriyaki bowl.
