This was the first Thai food I had since my trip to Thailand and it was very good.  I liked that they have Thai servers, it made the food more authentic.  It can get very busy and loud especially at lunch time.    I would recommend the Thai Tea, all beer they have is tasty, and everything i've ordered food wise was delicious.

A couple friends took me there Saturday.  It was very tasty and affordable.  It's a very small place and they cook right in front of you, if you sit inside (like waffle house but not as greasy and more delicious) and very friendly staff and atmosphere.  We had beer and mimosas with biscuits and gravy (comes with bacon/sausage or mushrooms and an egg), blackberry ricotta lemon pancakes, and a chicken sammich with cheddar, apple butter, on a homemade biscuit.

I have been eager to try this place after several recommendations. Green chilli burro was amazing!  Probably the best I've had anywhere!  It was spicy enough I didn't have to add any salsa, the chunks of meat were tender and the perfect size, the sauce was runny but I didn't mind.  Their salsa is quite enjoyable as well.  I will be back.

Very traditional and delicious.  I enjoy the atmosphere better than Pho Thanh.

We thought it would be the best spot on Main Street but it might actually be the worst.  We ordered wine, fresh tofu summer rolls, and Siamese kisses off the happy hour menu.  The summer rolls were mediocre, over portioned, and loosely wrapped.  The Siamese kisses were filled with chicken and bits of shrimp, loosely wrapped, and had the consistency of a meat ball.  We will not dine here again.

Three of us had dinner last night due to a friends recommended. We arrived early around 630pm and were one of maybe four tables so it was very quiet.    We started with the board appetizer, which was amazing.  My friend ordered the pollo piccatta (again), my mother ordered the fetticini alfredo, and I ordered the gamberi cappellini.  My friend was satisfied with his choice (once again), my mother's entree was bland, as was mine.  I expected there to be more than 6 small shrimp in my dish since the plate was $17.  We took my leftovers home to spruce up and try to enjoy for lunch at work.    Unfortunately I will not return to or recommend this establishment.  2/3 entrees we tried were not worth the price.  Service was okay but our waters were not refilled.

This little restaurant is amazing.  As authentic as it gets (as far as I know).  With cheap prices and traditional food, you cannot go wrong.    Chicken Shwarmas, babaganoush, hummus, falafel, pies, and kabobs are delicious.  Baklava from the bakery area is amazing as well.  I do suggest covering up your shoulders and wearing pants, as there are a lot of Muslims who frequent the store and restaurant.  I felt uncomfortable wearing shorts and a tank my first visit (which was during the summer) but it was my mistake.

I decided to try a new local coffee shop this morning to start the week off right but unfortunately this was the wrong coffee shop.  Very slow service and over priced.  No one in line and only one employee.  I ordered an Americano and a turkey pesto panini which came out to $10 +change.  For the price I did not expect the panini to be premade, gross, and still take 10 minutes to heat up.    If you are in search of a local coffee shop I recommend Jobot, Lola's, Cartel, Lux, or Songbird.    Avoid Terra Java.

Loved the purple rice.  The rolls are beautifully arranged and at a good price.  Sushi in this area are usually overpriced and small.  My friend and I ordered two rolls each, miso, and edamame (miso and edamame free with yelp check in!).  Way too much food for the two of us.  I will be back for sure!

My favorite spot for coffee and thai tea! They stick to local products, offer an impressive array of options including the latest coffee fads (like butter coffee), and keep frequent customer cards at the register!  I haven't ate anything here but always feel welcome and leave satisfied.  My favorite drink is the Thai tea with almond milk!  Their iced toddy and lattes are delicious as well.  If you do stop in check out the shop next door and the art displayed throughout the place!

I love this place and have been a returning guest for years now! I have not ordered anything that I didn't enjoy. My favorite is the Greek salad bowl (only served at the bar). It has gyro meat, feta, tomatoes,  cucumber, and kalamata olives.  Their drinks are always amazing as as well.

Great concept and service but the sushi is mediocre at best.  The sushi is made from pre-sliced packaged fish, squid was very chewy and hard in some spots, baked calamari did not taste fresh (I could not finish), seaweed salad had a lot of liquid and needed to be strained more after defrosting, the cream puffs looked like they came from Costco, we could see the carrot cake deconstructing every time it passed us, and they may mix up your check with the person next to you!   While our check was cheaper than expected (from mixing up checks) and they did run out the door to return a phone someone left, we will most likely not return. Great service but mediocre food.

I decided to have a healthy lunch and heard about kaleidoscope online, so I biked over. I decided on a bottled kale spinach juice and the kale salad. The juice prices were not on the menu,  wall,  or bottle. The total ended up being $20+ for the two items which is a bit much especially for lunch. Note: they do not offer half salads either.  When the employee delivered the salad, I noticed it lacked most the ingredients listed.  I thought maybe they were at the bottom of the bowl.  So she left and I started mixing the salad.  The salad only contained kale and lemon dressing. I confirmed with the menu to make sure of the ingredients. I returned the salad and asked "aren't there supposed to be pumpkin seeds,  hemp (?) seeds, and other ingredients? This is what I ordered,  yea?" (While pointing at the menu). She said yes, apologized, and offered an add on item at no cost which was nice.  She returned with the same salad with my fork in the same spot with the seeds and add on but the quinoa was still missing.   It alarmed me that she returned with the same salad she took from me because usually if an order is wrong the restaurant brings out an entirely new dish or a side of the missing items. I didn't want to interrupt the boisterous conversation between her and the baristas at Cartel again to get the salad I ordered. I will not return.  For a $20+ lunch of a mediocre salad and juice I expect employees to know the menu.
