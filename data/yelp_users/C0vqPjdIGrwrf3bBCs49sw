Omg. It took an hour just to get to me. The last half an hour, I was the only customer. This was after they told me it would only be 15 minutes and I only have an hour lunch and it took me 15 minutes to get here. I am beyond upset and no I don't want any more services! I'm late to work! /sigh/ this jiffy lube should be renamed "when-we-feel-like it lube". Do yourself a favor and don't do here.

I love Bob. He tells you like it is and he understands if you are so broke and works around it. I love the lovable cats...he's got names for all of them and kind of lessens the blow of the money you have to spend on fixing your car (which is an inevitability! They don't last forever!).  He is super knowledgeable and will answer any question you might have with no ulterior motive. He really just wants to help people while running a pretty smooth business.  I feel like he's a part of the family! I love this place and you will too!

I went to this place once before and enjoyed it (I had a second interview here). Maybe it was the fact that I was extremely hungry being out of work and needing a full meal or temporary insanity because when I went back today, that was not the case.  In short, here's what was wrong:  In our party of 8, the service was slow & not very attentive.  It took a long time for the food to come to the table. The food was not cooked as ordered, which was fixed but afterward, the food made us physically ill. We ate at 5 and still feeling the effects of the bad food at 12:20am.  I will probably never eat there again and I only had the lobster bisque which tasted nothing like lobster.

This is the mechanic you want to see if you are mechanically-challenged or if you are a girl who knows a little about cars! ;) Greg is honest, trust-worthy, and really easy going. He will get you back on the road in no time AND tell you what you need to watch for down the road. He's a good guy! If you're in Mesa, I highly recommend him (and believe me, when I say I've been through the ringer with car mechanics this year and this is a HIGH recommendation!)! I will coming back to him in the future most definitely!

I can't even bring myself to star this place but since I have to, it gets a begrudging 1! Sure, the prices were reasonable but I feel sick after eating there.  I asked the cashier if the fish was battered and she gave me a blank, mouth half opened stare, before she said: "uh huh."  The fish was breaded not battered. Strike one.  The battered is so prickly it cuts the roof of your mouth. Strike two.  Biting into the brick o' fish was just biting into a brick of breading.  It didn't even taste like fish!  Strike three.  I will never go here again.  Please do yourself a favor and save yourself the stomach ache I had to endure getting this review to you.

These guys are amazing. The food is great, they're so friendly, and they go above and beyond for me which I so appreciate! I had come off a 14 hour shift, too tired to make anything, and they all took care of me right at/after close! Thank you thank you from the bottom of my heart!

They are kind of pushy with the add-ons but as long as you are firm with what you want, you'll get whatever you want!

If you are tired of the same, humdrum, Mexican food place (and let's face it, AZ has a LOT of them) I recommend trying Fuzzy's Taco Shop on Mill Avenue!  I read the previous reviews on here and couldn't be more dumbfounded with the response.    This place was: Friendly? Check. Helpful? Check. Tasty? Check.  This is a regular stop for me when I'm on Mill.  I love the food, the happy hour gives you huge cheap drinks (if you drink -- I do not, but I recognize the appeal for everyone else), the service is with a smile, and the comfortable seating  (inside and outside) really does it for me.  Their salads are amazing, tacos (soft tempura shrimp tacos are my fav) are out of this world, and their burritos are HUGE!  You can really taste the freshness of the ingredients and the flavors blend well.  The one thing that I will say is that one time, I got a beef burrito that contained a lot of fatty meat.  Other than that, it's been pretty yummy.  So, please, do yourself a flavor and check this place out! :)  You won't regret it (coming from a girl who usually avoids tacos or burritos, I think that that says a lot!)  Yay! Fuzzy's! :)

Product: I was really happy with this place for the first week. Since I had a variety of e-cigs, I went into this place upon suggestion from one of my friends. After the tank broke within a week, they offered me no refund, no replacement, and then was only going to give me a new mouthpiece instead of a whole new tank that didn't leak (basically all the inside was destroyed from basic use and only refilling once).  I'm really upset that if there was no guarantee of parts after a WEEK, that wasn't mentioned to me initially (an nothing is posted) and it seems that something that doesn't last for a week should at least be replaced as faulty (especially since the girl helping me said: I see these break all the time -- if that's so, why wouldn't you sell better product or guarantee usability after a week?!?!)  Customer service: The girls look at me with blank stares as if they do not understand how to properly deal with the public except for the one girl who initially helped me, but she was on her way out of the store to go to California. Also, they seem friendlier to men than women (this is just a comparison of "warmthness" between my interactions and their interactions with the males in the store). They only seen moderately knowledgeable on the products at hand.  Atmosphere: There's a place to kinda hang at the front with leather couches to sit around and smoke; the sales area is pretty open with a lot of room to move around. It's clean. I wouldn't say it's inviting, but it's definitely accommodating but the feeling is "get in, get out" really.  Cost: I've found other juices that are cheaper elsewhere, however, you can taste test the juices here. The parts are less expensive elsewhere. I was trying this location because it was convenient for me.

Here's the thing. I have been looking for a couch for 3 years...yes, literally 3 years! This was supposed to be Christmas present and haven't been able to find the right one. My mother told me after I had all but given up hope, to go to this place and check It out.  First of all, it's not a large shop. If you're looking to walk for miles and miles, this isn't the shop for you. They do, however, have a cream-of-the-crop selection that within about 10 minutes, I knew what I wanted to investigate further. (Yay for not spending so much time in a furniture shop!)  Secondly, this is a family-run store! Hooray for local businesses! They are low pressure (which is nice because I've been high-pressured to death) but also very personable.  To the untrained eye, this may look like they are hanging out with friends and not taking care of you (as per the reviewer Anon A. seemed to think) but it's actually just ONE person manning the store, MAYBE two on a busy day but talking through options because they are THOROUGH.  Thirdly, because they are so personal, they aren't going to BS you. I got told by Ashley furniture that they warrantied their leather for a lifetime and I took the salesperson at their word. When I called and spoke to Dan, he laid it all out that they were trying to pull the wool over my eyes. No one, he says, would do that past one year in the industry.  I know what you think, he said, she said, right? Well, being resourceful, I looked up Ashley's written warranty and it states that it is only good for a year.  The big box store had lied to me to get the sale while the small business, who told me the truth and RISKED a sale, didn't.  That means a lot to me.  Fourthly, they worked with me to give me the best quality for the best value. They not only have financing available but are willing to work the numbers for you if you have cash.  As someone who is a pretty tough nut to crack, these guys gave me sanity in a new couch (FINALLY!). Thank you so much!

Linh made my monster feet into beautiful, delicate feet. She was very nice and friendly and willing to make her customers feel at home. She introduced me to Jan who was also working and they asked me where I was from and talks to me like one of their friends. That's one of the things I enjoy seeing is their regulars coming back and talking and gabbing to the workers. That means that people feel comfortable here -- I certainly did. I came with an open expectation and will leave feeling amazing.  There's 8 pedicure stations that will massage you into putty and 6 nail stations. It's a small space but it's well lit, maintained, and clean. It doesn't have that awful chemical nail smell that some salons have. I am definitely coming back here over and over! Thank you sunset nails!
