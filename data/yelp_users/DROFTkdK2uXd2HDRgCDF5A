I don't like giving negative reviews but this week really got under my skin.  I went twice in one week and both time they screwed up my order. The first time they forgot my bagels. The second, it was bad. I ordered a pretzel bagel, with veggie garden schmear, avocado and turkey. Sounds amazing, right? What I got instead was a pumpkin bagel. Talk about a disgusting mess. Sorry Einstein's, I won't be back for a while until you get your affairs in order.

This is such a great hidden gem. The service was phenomenal and the food was amazing. We let the server take charge and plan our meal for us so everything was a surprise. We got the house bread, meatballs, gusto bb salad and the triple P pizza. All of it was delicious and just kept getting better. We even had dessert, house made cheesecake! The server was well versed in the menu, wine and any questions we had. It was such a wonderful experience and cannot wait to go back !
