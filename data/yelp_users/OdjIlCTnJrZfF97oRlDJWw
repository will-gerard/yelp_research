A great local pizza, with a thin foldable crust and an interesting choice of cheese. Still not quite 5 star worthy, as this pizza does have more than its fair share of grease, but worth repeat business.

This is quickly becoming one of our favorite places to eat. Service is great, pasta and sauces are almost perfect, and ambiance is surprisingly great for a strip mall. They want to put mushrooms in everything, and their wine list is slightly out of date, but those minor annoyances can be forgiven with everything else being right.

This place is amazing in a way that makes it's glaring faults meaningless. The Orange Chicken, Walnut Shrimp, Lemon Chicken, and Honey Chicken are all what great Americanized Chinese food should be. The fried rice and white rice are both always just right, and the soups are always hot and delicious. Their crab puffs have just the right mix of cream cheese and crab, and the egg rolls are pretty darn good as well.  I mean, sure, the people who work here obviously don't like you, but they at least put in a TV recently, to replace the old creepy year round Christmas music. The tacky carts they bring the food on are off-putting at first, but after a few trips and a few delicious meals, the cacophony of sound from the old cart creates a Pavlovian reaction. Now the sound of a rickety cart across a hard floor makes me hungry!

Great people here who work with you promptly and shoot you straight. Had my wife get in a little kerfuffle with a wall, causing tire, rim, and slight bumper damage. It was driving funny, but we didn't want to use our insurance and pay a deductible if the problem costed less than the deductible.  They stayed a little late, and gave us two options. One was under the deductible amount, the other over. Even though they knew it meant less money for them, they were cool doing the cheaper option so we could avoid the hit to our premiums. And I tell you, the work they did was great! They paid attention to detail, washed the car... all for a measly 300 dollar job.  I couldn't recommend these guys enough.

For meetings at work, these pizzas are often ordered. I have come to look forward to such meetings. This pizza is thin but not too thin, and somehow foldable and crispy at the same time.  There are also dessert things I saw once, and they were ridiculous. Like dough with powdered sugar and a jam like substance to dip into. I'll need to investigate these further, for your sakes of course. I'm a giver.

This is a clean place with good service... But the food is just not great. The breakfast and Carne Asada burritos were not bad, just nothing to write home about. However, their chicken tacos had some sort of dehydrated chicken or something. The wife had a hard time eating it.  I debated giving a third star, but when eating your food is an unpleasant struggle, you get no third star.

Efficient and effective, they actually had time to do an oil change quickly on the Friday before Labor Day, while everyone else was trying to schedule me for the next Wednesday (as if that made sense for anyone but them). The waiting area is cool, with TV and a couch and wifi and decent coffee. I'll likely take my car here quite often after this experience, hopefully just for oil changes (which are decently priced when you check the website for specials, and when you check in on Yelp).

Had a phone start freaking out on me two weeks after I bought it, and honestly expected to be given the runaround about the warranty. I scheduled an appointment at the Genius Bar and showed up to a packed house. Around me were many tales of woe leading to Genius Bar appointments on a Saturday night, but everyone was seen and addressed fairly quickly.  I heard patience with the less technically astute in the crowd, and was seen within 10 minutes of my appointment time. The guy saw I knew what I was talking about so he pulled the diagnostic, saw what I suspected, and gave me a new phone on the spot. I was up and running in 10 minutes.  While I wish it was under better circumstances, and that I'd had a fully functional phone/camera while camping, I've got to hand it to Apple. This experience didn't suck.

So this place gets a bad rap for being unhealthy. To be fair, they have a menu that could be mistaken for a small book, and it is filled with unhealthy delicious options. My friends all loved their unhealthy food and I looked longingly at them as I ate my salad.  And there is our headline. There is an ENTIRE MENU of healthy options, and I mean seriously healthy. Kale is involved, and when Kale shows up, you know healthy is about to throw down. The options included a lot of sandwiches, which didn't work for my carb-averse diet, so I requested the most obnoxious thing on the planet: a lettuce-wrapped sandwich with a side salad.  They served it, and it was what health nuts would describe as "delicious". I am working my way there, so as of now I can affirm that it was "food". Still, I was impressed with their response to the bad rap, and the many options on their healthy "Skinnylicious" menu. You can have very green meals here.

This place looks like a giant conglomeration of garage sales and clearance racks. It was empty and sad, obviously on its last legs. I left quickly, and went to better stores with some semblance of design flow.

I hadn't gone to Olive Garden in quite a while, preferring the local Italian scene over the corporate monster. So when we came here for a friend's birthday, I already had a bad bias coming into the experience.  I gotta say, this was actually a pretty good experience. The service dealt with our party of 10 and split checks quite well, and were very attentive. The place still had the cheesy OG look, but it worked for the occasion.  The food was also decent to awesome, of course with the huge quantities you'd expect from an olive garden. The calamari was good both spicy and original, and my Tour of Italy was reliably decent, though I wish I'd gone for a pasta dish. They had some great specials, too, and by the end of the evening the wife and I were planning a future date night here.   Well played, Olive Garden.

This restaurant has a lot going for it. We celebrated our anniversary here before seeing Phantom of the Opera, and they definitely kept the night classy. They fell short of five stars, but in ways that made 4 stars an easy decision.  It started with a reservation. Perhaps we just aren't regulars, but people would come in after us and be seated before us for the exact same reservation, exact same time. This is the moment I knew we'd have time issues.   However, we were wished happy anniversary by everyone as we sat, and they signed a card and gave a small box of chocolates. The service tried to be great, and nearly succeeded. The place was loud, but in a festive kind of way. Not quite romantic, but fun nonetheless.  The servers took great care of us, making solid recommendations and being generally humorous and engaging. Unfortunately, they also brought out the calamari appetizer AFTER the steak, and only after being reminded. Yet I can't completely throw them under the bus, because they took the calamari off the check.  And that calamari. Amazing. And that New York Strip. Perfection. And that chicken. Total win. Even the gnocchi was great. The salad sucked, but it was a basic Caesar. Just wish they'd used something other than hearts in there. But the rest was amazing.   Again, overall amazing food, and a solid recovery that kept this a four star experience even with the blunders. I still left wanting to come back. And come back we will.

This place looked like it would be amazing, and there was definitely fun to be had. However, so many of the games weren't working right that it took the fun out of the day. If I were a little kid and I had saved up just to play a game where you can't aim the gun right, or get your tickets, or strum the guitar, it would be heartbreaking!  I was standing in a section full of games either turned off or broken, on a Saturday in the summer in Arizona, when I realized that this place is likely literally dying. Half full, no one really happy, faces full of disappointment, and they are grasping at straws with the groupons and free offers (and they didn't make me want to come back, so it was all for naught).  In a past life, I would talk to small businesses about their reviews, and they would always be insistent that the bad reviews weren't their fault and weren't real. Well, in this case a quarter of your games were off, another quarter were not working properly (yet taking money), and that isn't anyone else's fault but management.

I've been here twice, for Sufjan Stevens and the EVMCO Christmas Concert. I was impressed both times. This is a beautiful venue, like a smaller and nicer Gammage. It is still large enough to be epic, and the acoustics are stellar. Parking in the area isn't awful, though finding your entry door can be a bit stressful.  Still, this is one of my favorite big venues in the valley, and a big reason why Downtown Mesa is a thing now.

The food is decent, with both a passable Mexican menu and a better "American" menu. The prices are reasonable, and the facility/location is pretty much the only decent thing about the otherwise stabby "Heritage District". The old school force is strong in this one.   The service is awful, though, especially if you have no "old Maricopa" in you. The place is understaffed, and the staff often seems inconvenienced by your mere presence. We've given this place numerous chances (wanting to have a great local place to bring visitors), but been disappointed one too many times.  This place has tons of potential though, if they can get their act together.

This place was best summed up by their biscuits. Different than you'd expect, yet still pretty good.  See, when I think old school diner, I expect a crowd of old people and a waitress who has... well, who has been beaten down by life and is still standing out of tenacity and spite. Instead there are young, attractive ladies (a friend called them hangover hotties) serving us, and a mix of young trendy kids and old bikers enjoying the food.   The coffee was typical diner coffee, maybe a little pricy.  Then the food came. Both my wife and I come from breakfast loving families, so we have high standards. The biscuits were at first disappointing, looking like dinner rolls. But they tasted right, and were actually not bad. The chorizo and egg was definitely gringo style, but some cholula fixed that. The omelette wasn't her dad's omelette, but they were dang generous with the bacon. Beans were good, but the potatoes were like a blank canvas, in need of your ketchup, hot sauce, and salt and pepper accents.  Overall the experience was teetering between 3 stars and 4. It was pretty good overall, but the great service gave me that extra push. They live up to the four star rating.

Nice ballpark, a little too big though. The top seats are never taken so it always feels empty. And the fans tend to half be for the other team.  Food is also quite expensive, and it's really silly to charge 9.75 and other non-full dollar amounts for the concessions that the hawkers carry.  The fireworks are great on Fridays, though, and again... The ballpark is really nice.

What can be added to what has already been said about Joe's? This place is an institution, and is about the best you can get of "Arizona BBQ".  So why just 4 stars? Because so many of us are from other places, myself included. This place is paid the highest compliment when people from Texas (myself), the midwest, and the south all give it decent marks. My Texan tastes are pleased with the brisket, the sausage (which doesn't hold a candle to the sausage found in Elgin, TX), and the ribs. The sauce is pretty good, and the sides are good for what they are. You can't really mess up potatoes or mac and cheese.  That cornbread nearly takes this to 5 stars, but I can't give it on principle. Still, Joe, you are darn good for making me consider it.

Have a tiny car, a tiny ass, and enjoy paying the highest prices in the valley for the privilege of watching a movie at a reasonably convenient time? Well, have I got the theater for you!  I mean seriously, whoever drew these lines used SMART cars and Fiats to gauge the proper space size. It's comical to see people try to park anywhere near the theater, especially large vehicles. I suggest parking in front of men's warehouse.  Bring more money while you're at it. That 7pm date night movie sets you back 12.50 a piece. The popcorn is more expensive, tastes worse, and is smaller than any of the other theaters within 20 miles. The drinks are on par with the competition. They have an icee machine, which is why they have two stars.  By the time you've gotten your tix, popcorn, and drinks, you've paid about 8 dollars more than at the theaters 4 miles down (either direction). Luckily, it's worth it when you get in the hot theater with smaller seats than everyone other than Pollack.  Oh, wait. No it isn't. The only saving graces for this theater are the events they host (like RiffTrax) and the Icee machine. Which they probably stole from Circle K.

Love these people! They do whatever they can to help you as best they can, and are friendly doing it. The ice is cheaper and better than any other store in town. The idea of "water and ice" as a store sounded ridiculous to me until I found myself needing a ridiculous amount of ice. Now I get it. Well played.

This place is always quite helpful, and the prices aren't as awful as you'd think being the only hardware store in town. They somehow fit almost everything you'd need in their undersized location, and their tool and plant selection are higher quality than Wal-Mart. The free popcorn is a nice touch.

The food lags far behind even other Native New Yorker locations. They don't have everything on their menu, and their service is lazy. Everyone seemed unhappy working there. Honestly, we haven't gone back there since March, and considering the lack of other options, you have to be pretty bad to get out of the Maricopa rotation. Congrats, Native.

Plenty of healthy options, never a real wait for anything (including the pharmacy), plenty of parking, great prices, good produce, good meat... if I didn't live right next to Wal-Mart, I'd probably never go anywhere but Fry's.  Their Rotisserie Chicken is awesome, too!

My wife and I were wanting something different, and had never really given The Duke a try for dinner. Their lunch is always decent, so we went for the Friday fish fry. Originally I wanted to get steak, but all you can eat fish is a solid idea if done right.   I was unsure if I could do the fish thing, as I am currently unable to eat a ton of carbs. Fortunately, they were very accommodating when I asked for a mix of grilled and fried with a fruit cup to replace the fries, as well as when my wife asked for a lettuce wrapped burger.  And that food was still darn good. It came out fast, the fish tasted fresh (in Maricopa that is rare), and the service and drinks were excellent. Before this visit, this was a 3 star place in my book. That changed tonight. Great job, we will be back!

They have a clean, efficient setup, a selection of decent (flash frozen) meat, and plenty of fresh veggies and sauces. If the meat were fresh or the price a bit lower I'd add the fifth star, but ultimately everything else in your experience comes down to your skills. I get 3 tasty meals out of my visit, and here is my strategy:  1. Get some butcher paper and repeatedly crush down your meat to create a secondary "meat bowl" effect. This allows more meat and less mess.  2. Spices: don't be shy.  3. Veggies: feel free to have a small pile, and use butcher paper to scrunch it down.  4. Noodles: gotta do the trifecta, but end with a big pile of wheat noodles. They weigh everything down.  5. Sauce: if following these instructions, double the recipe on the board, pour a few scoops on the noodles themselves, and add some hot chili oil for good measure.  6. Cooking: don't miss the crunchy and sweet things at the end. If you like those things, they are available.  7. Tips: tip the cook. It's hot back there.  8. Post-Game: You will not finish this. You will have extra sauce on the bottom. Get 2 bowls of brown rice to soak up that delicious sauce and get two to-go cartons worth of awesome leftovers. They will be better the next day after soaking up flavors overnight.  9. Label your cartons. People are crazy.  There ya go. Happy eating!

I had heard of people going here for lunch. I wondered what the heck they ate.  The answer is "Every Good Thing On Earth". It was like a cafeteria for grown ups. Pizza is great. Chicken is delicious. Macaroni is spot on. The salad area has stuff to make you not hate your salad. It's a great place, and I haven't even touched on the Asian foods or actual store. I'll let you know when I get there.  Bonus points: They didn't judge the overweight guy for daring to step foot in their Granola Empire. In fact, they were downright friendly! Although I felt like Hagrid at Hogwarts.

The alley is a run of the mill 90's era neighborhood joint. It is the epitome of average, with absolutely nothing special about it except for decent prices on certain nights. The prices are paid for by your feet, which are destroyed in 15 year old shoes that double as torture devices.  In fact, this place might just be two stars except that the cookies are good, the music isn't annoying, and the a/c works.  Why five stars then? Customer service. These guys take their piece of 1998 and rock it. Good people can make up for a... well, less good facility.

Now, first of all, I am giving this place 5 stars KNOWING that it isn't all that "authentic". The guy making the sushi is named Juan. The sushi is going in circles. There is awful K-pop on the speakers.  And yet, the place is where I go when I want sushi, and it never fails to deliver. It has a good mix of "real" sushi and "American" sushi, and everything is fresh and delicious. The conveyor belt is a fun way to pick and choose what you want to eat.  Even my wife, who is quite picky, has found a couple of things she now eats at all sushi places (cali roll, spicy crab and shrimp roll, edimame).  You can order specific rolls if you don't see them coming up (Baked Scallop Cali Roll), and count on delicious Las Vegas Rolls and Mountain Potato Rolls to kick the flavor up a notch.

This theatre company is known to do things off the beaten path, and the Stray Cat production of Heathers lived up to the billing. This was their first musical in a while, from what they told us, and you could tell from the occasional sound issues. It may be the venue (somehow both too small and too cavernous for the live, often rushing, band), so I'm excited to see what they do in different valley venues (as they become a traveling company this year).   The performances could definitely fill a bigger venue! The Heathers were all played well, and the jocks were a great fit as a comic duo. Cole Brackney was a serviceable voice and sizeable (albeit rather small) presence as J.D., but Brittany Howk was on another level vocally and emotionally as Veronica. It reminded me a little of seeing Chris Mann in the traveling production of Phantom Of The Opera: that girl could be something big.  The band, as mentioned before, tended to rush the tempo significantly, leading to some songs losing their most powerful moments, but they definitely had talent and could be significantly better by the time you are reading this. I've run sound before so I'll have some Grace on the tech crew (that size a production going through three 15s isn't gonna cut it, unless your sound guy is a minor deity). This is a 4 star production/company. They are darn good, entertaining, and have the potential and talent to be the best live production in the valley with a bit more development.

I've heard so many amazing things about Grimaldi's, which is both a good thing and a bad thing. It's good because ultimately the good word led me here, but it also gave me unrealistic expectations.   The salad options are delicious and generous, and so is the wood fired, thin crust pizza. We had the white pizza with spinach, a pepperoni, and a spicy chicken sausage. The white was creamy crunchy delicious, the pepperoni was solid, and the spicy chicken sausage lived up to it's name. It was all pretty darn tasty.   It is expensive compared to other local pizza joints, but the quality is there. The drinks are overpriced, but that isn't unusual. I suppose the problem is that I was told this would be the best pizza out there over and over again. I expected too much. Instead I got a pizza that can hang with the other great options in the area, in a cool environment, which was somehow both a win and a disappointment.

The first time I came into this place, I felt like they wanted to throw me in the wok. And yes, this is a 5-star review, so let this be a lesson in perseverance. The place is unassuming on the inside, although much nicer than it once was. The food is served on paper plates, the soup in Dixie bowls. In short, it is as unpretentious as possible, and they aren't going to win you over with personality (although they warm up to you once you get to know them, and they're actually pretty awesome).  That being said, even if they insulted my grandmother, I'd keep coming back. This food is that amazing! There are two local chinese places me and my wife frequent, and this is my personal favorite. That Dixie bowl egg drop soup with the bag of crunchy noodles is the best I've ever had, and they have Sriracha hot sauce at the table just to kick it up a notch. It is a huge serving, and it comes with all of the combos. My work friends swore by the Cashew Chicken with white rice, and my wife prefers the Lemon Chicken with white rice (and both are quality options), but I go here for the best Orange Chicken in town, with the best pork fried rice. This stuff is to die for, and the servings are so big you will never leave hungry.  Of course, the crab puffs are amazing, and some of the other options have been good as well. I don't know that there has been a meal we've been down on while we've been here. They do everything right!

I expected a lot from this place. Everyone in my group raved about it, and I got excited as I saw how delicious their plates looked. My own food came, and it looked and smelled amazing. I was excited to start the meal.  However, the pizza was missing... something. The flavors just didn't pop. I put some peppers and cheese on it, but it was still just edible. They did that thing where they put extra flour on the crust to make it seem more "fresh", but I think it muted the flavors even more.  The mac and cheese was also lacking flavor, which was really disappointing. Everyone ate happily and loved their food, and I'm sure that my meal was just the one bad meal in the bunch. For that, I'll give sauce a 2nd star. Still, for 13 bucks, I was quite disappointed.

Had this thing on my, um, upper back part of my leg where I sit. It hurt a lot and needed to be lanced and drained. This place is five minutes from work so I gave it a shot.  Checked in online for both visits (there was a follow up) and showed up with my insurance card and I.d. Ready, and waited less than 5 minutes each time. I was seeing a P.A./doctor in less than 15. Everyone was friendly, and understanding about my rather embarrassing issue. They were skilled, and cared enough to follow up on the issue two days later (they just told me to come in whenever so I was able to fit it into a busy day).  I'll definitely come back to this urgent care in the future. They are first class.

Good wings, great happy hour specials, and a chill vibe. The outside area is cool. The only thing keeping this from being a five star experience is the TV placement. It was rather awkward to watch MNF the way the place is set up.

I was quite pleasantly surprised at how good this place was! I am a big fan of their happy hour, and their rolls are quite generous as well. This place is a step above the revolving sushi set in terms of quality.  The space they are in is tiny, and they fill every bit of it. If you are waiting for a table, you are likely doing so outside. I know there isn't much choice in this matter, or much else they can do, but it still detracted from the experience.  Nevertheless, this place is darn good for a small town sushi joint. We will definitely do date night there again!

This is the best place to eat in Maricopa, hands down! Now, that's like being the classiest Kardashian, but still... this place is good. I enjoy the Rigatoni Basilico, and anything else with their Pesto sauce. Their pizzas are fantastic, and the atmosphere is about as classy as Maricopa gets.  Still, can't give them five stars, because their 10 dollar calamari is way too chewy, and almost soggy in texture. It was a huge disappointment that only Pesto could make better.

Not too bad for a little Arizona aquarium. I had only ever gone to the Texas State Aquarium, which of course is much larger, but this one had nice touches. There are certain limitations, being based in an existing mall, so while the lack of larger sharks and dolphins disappointed me, I commend their responsibility.  They had a few really cool touches as well, including the different views available of the tanks and fish. Our favorite, of course, was the ocean view tunnel, where we saw their collection of stingrays and small sharks. Great photo ops there.  We came in at a discount, but I can see how full price can seem high for the size and scope of the aquarium. However, when you live in Arizona, you've got to pay a premium for good fish. Great experience overall.

Unexpectedly awesome. I'd never been here, and bought a groupon on a whim. A buddy from work came with me, and gave me the rundown. I thought this place was like Blimpie's (yeah, that old place). It's not.  We sat down, my buddy ordered a half sandwich with fries, and I went Breakfast (heck yeah, all day breakfast!). By "breakfast", I mean Chicken Fried Steak with Gravy, Eggs, Hash Browns (really good), and a blueberry bagel (choose the bagel here, it's awesome).  Our big worry was that we would end up late for our meeting after lunch, but they got us our food pretty quickly.  The Half Sandwich was pretty much the size of a Toddler's head. The meal in front of me nearly made me nod off in the aforementioned meeting, being so huge and delicious. That sausage gravy set the whole thing off, and the bagel ended up a nice dessert.  After that awesome meal, we ended up only a dollar over our 20 dollar Groupon (both went with waters), and got back in time for our nap... er... meeting.

This is a tiny place inside of a strip mall that I had never known existed. My in-laws actually suggested it, and we met there for dinner. They raved about it, and the place was tiny but packed. I had the yellow curry, and wife had something with peanut sauce on it.  Everything was delicious, and arrived quickly. They have the typical 1-5 scale of hotness, and I ventured a 3 while everyone else stayed at 2. 3 was perfect for me, but they were all complaining about their "2+" dishes. I concluded that they were all wimps, but if you are also a wimp know that 2 is "wimp hot".

Amazing wait staff, and the great interior almost makes you forget that you are in a fancy strip mall. We were celebrating an anniversary, so the chef came out and personally gave us a little ladle of fresh caprese salad.   The flatbreads are a must, and the draft beer selection is surprisingly decent. I had the Shrimp and Grits (surprisingly good for a nice place like this), and the wife had the roasted chicken. Both were generous, under 20 bucks, and incredibly flavorful.  I didn't expect to be full and happy at such a well appointed restaurant, but the overall mood is casual enough to put someone like me at ease, while being nice enough for an impressive date night. That is a rare combo, and deserves 5 stars.

This place just oozes nerd-cool. The movie theatres are nothing too impressive; really just projectors connected to blu-ray players and a decent sound system. But the seats are large and comfortable, the drinks (only beer and wine) are reasonably priced, and there is often live music either in the lounge or in an actual theatre.  In fact, the Seryn concert was one of the weirdest, yet somehow coolest, experiences I've ever had at a concert. They didn't have lights for a concert, so they instead projected a documentary about a rural, seemingly aboriginal tribe. If you know Seryn, you know that the natural beauty of the shots in the movie paired ridiculouosly well with the music of Seryn. In fact, they should provide the soundtrack for movies more often.  Of course, at the end they switched to this crazy documentary of baby chicks on a conveyor belt, which put a damper on the whole thing. But most of the experience was great.  Anyway, this place is a little weird but pretty darn cool. If you find a movie that intrigues you, this is a great place to watch it.

Oh my friggin stars, this place is ridiculously good. After my first bite of Alfredo the Dark, I became angry at the entire valley for not forcing me to try this place earlier! But my anger was quickly overcome by my newfound love for diced tomatoes.  Seriously, I hate tomatoes in non-sauce form, but I love these tomatoes. They danced amid the noodles like little red morsels of pure joy.  I couldn't finish my meal. I'm a 300+ lb. man. But I had to save space, because I was about to be introduced to the Pazooki.  Me and my tiny female work friend shared the Pazooki. She devoured it as fast as I did. We tore that thing up. Usually I'd care about things like whether someone else's spoon touched a certain piece of food, but not today my friend. Not today.

I've been going here for a few years now. This fro-yo is quite good, and the selection is decent as well (although it can be rather hit or miss). The price isn't bad, and the punch card can fill up quick if you go with groups.  The real star of the show, though, is the toppings bar. Brownie chunks, candy pieces, gummies and sour gummies, sauces, and a bunch of other stuff make this an amazing opportunity if you know what you're doing. If you don't... well... since it's self-serve, the only one to blame is yourself.  I like the atmosphere, too. Extremely kid-friendly but not annoyingly so, and with a couple of spots outside to enjoy as well. The place stays clean, which is a miracle in the presence of grubby-pawed Maricopa children.

They have always struggled with service, but at least the food is consistent. Even the employees who give good service will openly tell you they are wanting to leave. Not sure what the issue is, but it's a bummer to visit this place. Always.

Super friendly owners and staff, awesome crepes, good coffee, and occasional concerts. This is an awesome place, my favorite in Maricopa! I'd find some way to hack the system and give them 6 stars if they'd stay open in the evenings.

Love their breakfast burritos. Service has been good all but once. Decent prices, fresh ingredients.

They improved over the years, and are now the best burritos in town. I'd say more, but I shouldn't talk with my mouth full.

We have used this service twice, for our two dogs and cat. When we have a friend check on them while we are away, stuff is destroyed and the animals are restless when we get home. When we have Kim and her people (who I found here on Yelp) check on our animals, they are happy and healthy and our stuff isn't ripped to shreds.  One of my dogs is deaf, and the other has some "emotional baggage" from her previous owners, so we are quickly learning that a service like this is crucial in planning our trips. If you have special needs animals, you can trust these people.  Yelp is still telling me to write more, so allow me to sing to you the song of my people... I seriously have nothing else. The price is reasonable? They give treats?

This place looks amazing. Great layout, manages to be it's own place inside of the UltraStar complex. The TVs are well placed, the projector is a nice touch, and the lounge is a great place to watch a game. The food is pricey but decent. It fills up with the older singles often, so if watching 40 somethings try to make something happen isn't your scene, this might not be your game.  I find it entertaining.  The service is good now that they've gotten in their groove, and the beer selection is probably the best in Maricopa other than Fry's (which doesn't say much). It would be nice if you didn't have to pass screaming children in the lobby area to get to it (kills the Lounge vibe), but hey, it's Copa... if you haven't passed a child, and old person, or a toad in the past 10 minutes, you've probably been in the bathroom too long.

This place is amazing! There is so much to do here, and everything is nice! Bowling is awesome, although service can be a bit slow. The food is decent, the arcade is pretty awesome, the movie theater is SPECTACULAR and rarely crowded, the Laser Tag arena is small but the space is used well, and the Luxe Lounge is pretty darn awesome for watching sports and getting drinks!  The weak link has been the 347 Grill, but I think they are getting better. The food side of this place is the only thing keeping my review at four stars instead of five. Still, the Lobster Mac and Cheese was pretty amazing, so there is reason for hope!

3.5 star food, 4.5 star service. Everyone was super friendly, and this had the feel of a local favorite rather than an assembly line steak joint. The happy hour appetizer (chips) was solid, though the on tap selection was lacking. The steak and chicken were both good, though I should have gone with the ribeye instead of the filet. The sweet potato was tasty, but the fries were average and the salads were meh.  But you don't go to a steakhouse for salad and fries. You go for meat, and the meat was good. I'd recommend this as a good local place to eat, especially if you don't want to fight Roadhouse crowds. You won't be wowed, but you won't regret your night either.

We went to this place when it was mostly empty, so I was concerned. But the beer selection was pretty good, local craft and other interesting and solid choices. 15 in all. The waitress got a kick out of the appetizer that involved balls, but it was really just mashed potatoes in fried balls. Nothing to get excited about.  They have this giant bacon burger with bacon in and on top of the burger patty. It has a fried egg on it as well. It was the bomb. It was huge, like a child's head.  Staff seems pretty fun, a little weird but that's OK. I'm weird too. The prices were a little high, with three of us spending close to $90 on three meals, one appetizer, and a few drinks. To be fair though, we went with entrées and not the lunch specials. Those were six dollars I think.

This is the most I've ever paid for a lettuce wrapped sandwich. It is also the best lettuce wrapped sandwich I've ever had. I added steak to the Patino D, their daily special. This is one of those places where the special is the most expensive thing, and that's without the steak. 16 bucks later, my sandwich ruled all. Beat the heck out of a five dollar foot long.  I can't get over the fact that I paid that much for a sandwich. I'd do it again though.

Cool little spot for some pick me up drinks. The space is small and off the main strip, making it a little less crazy. The staff is friendly and the drinks are decent, if a little inconsistent.  They need to do something about the hours though. I can only visit on Saturdays since they close so early during the week. With the Bucks in town, this place will miss out on a lot of customers without being available to those of us who commute, which is more than half the town. I'd love to hang here on a weeknight with some tea and a couple of friends.

This place is literal heaven during the summer in Phoenix. Everything there tastes whimsically amazing, and the staff is super friendly and helpful. That Sea Salt Caramel is the bomb, and don't you dare skip out on the waffle cone!  They also offer you water every five minutes, which is important here in this vicious hellscape, this monument to man's arrogance known as Phoenix. They are making sure you don't die.

This is a great, family-friendly-without-being-lame-or-childish venue, filled with talented improv artists meeting that same dash-filled description. Well lit, well run, and the right mix of personal and professional, with a great audience participation element.  However, it does get super quiet in there, and if you happen to privately meow to your wife, the entire audience and performers may hear it and wonder what the heck just happened. Not that I know from experience or anything. #thatwouldbeweird #Iamnotweird

This former Teakwoods location still sports the same light fixtures, but the cheesy Mexican-ish decor effectively sets the mood for a cheesy Mexican restaurant, replete with a giant sombrero for birthdays, gaudy tile tabletops, a creepy painting of a stereotypical mustachioed melancholy Mexican man, and the iconic sizzling fajita plate.  You've heard the old adage "judge a Mexican restaurant by its chips and salsa." The salsa was not at all spicy, but it had a decent, slightly sweet flavor. It wasn't my wife's favorite, so if you like more spice with less sweet, you won't like it either.  The service is at the same time frenetic, polite, and terse. The combination is slightly off-putting, but functionally they are quick and thorough. Just don't expect the waiter to be your new friend. Also, they brought out my wife's tacos before our meal, and her meal was an appetizer. Weird.  We had the fajitas and a quesadilla. The tortillas were decent, as were the sizzling fajitas, rice and beans. It was a solid meal, though nothing truly special. One oddity was the 4 dollar charge to get a combo of beef and chicken. My wife's quesadilla was just chicken and cheese on a tortilla because she requested it that way, but they were accommodating and she was happy.  Overall this place is a 3.5 star place (but I'm nice so it's 4), and considering the alternatives for sit down eating under 30 bucks, this is likely your best option in town unless you want to open your wallet a bit at 347 or Brooklyn. Not the best Mexican food, but the best place that actually serves you the Mexican food. Which I suppose translates to "better than Penascos."

Revolving Sushi!!!  We love the original location in Ahwatukee/Tempe, so when we saw this had opened up by our friend's place, dinner was decided. The sushi was just a shade below the original standard (still good), but the location was more spacious and less packed. Also, the service was much more personable.  The prices are still crazy low, and my wife and I ate ourselves sick with too much sushi for under 30 bucks. We will be back, and you should stop in too, even if just for a snack (ya know, like anything under 8 plates).

Great concept, impressive array of systems, pretty good bar, and a friendly staff. This place has potential, but it's still rough around the edges, with sad wasted space and random weird lighting.   It isn't quite a barcade, as most of the games are on systems (old school and new). It isn't quite a LAN party, as perhaps too many of the games are of the anti-social, 1 player, old school variety, which feels somewhat awkward in a public place. Perhaps having a purposeful area of these games, with the group games in separate areas, would work better.  But I'm nitpicking for the hypothetical person who isn't me. I personally love the place and wish it were further south.

First class establishment. I am not a golfer in the least, and was lucky to drive the ball 100 yards, but there were two targets right there. Heck, I might have gotten decent at aiming straight playing here.   The drink selection and food are on point, and the service was excellent. I thoroughly enjoyed myself here. I'll definitely be back now that I have that membership.

Having been to the one in Scottsdale and waited 30 minutes for a burger, I warned my friends that this place may take a while. I had even less hope while trying to get a parking space for lunch (I ended up parking behind the Karate place). Pro tip: Make your own parking spot along the little road that goes through the shopping center, if you know how to parallel park.  Coming in sweaty and last among my group, I was led outside to the back patio.   Woot. More sweat.  But it actually wasn't bad. The misters did their job in the shade, and we were all quite comfortable. The service was 10 times better than the Scottsdale location. When I couldn't decide between fries and sweet tots, I ordered the fries, but they brought me out a tiny thing of sweet tots to try. They were, of course, delicious (I mean, they are sweet potato tots). So I got an order of them as well, adding on to the Open Pit Burger and fries (I shared).  The place is a bit spendy, with no real lunch menu to speak of. It was about 20 bucks with tip, more than I usually spend for lunch (but that did include the tots). The burgers are large, but the flavor is average. Nothing really pops.  But they know what to do with a potato, and their beer selection is on point (I was there for work, but I perused). That, coupled with great service, made this a pretty good experience. I'll probably go back. On payday.

Nothing super special, but solid. The best donuts in Copa by far. No supermarket aftertaste, and somewhat affordable. Odd location, but I like the irony of a donut shop next to my gym (that I haven't visited in a few weeks).

This place is the sort of trendy, locally sourced, free range crunchy paradise that just begs you, dares you to hate it. You look at the ridiculously bubbly show off at the counter effortlessly tossing the most delicious looking salad you've ever seen (seriously, I'm not even a salad guy) while taking your order and apparently running the whole show, and you consider punching him... except that he stands between you and sandwich paradise, so you play his game like he's the upbeat cousin of the Soup Nazi.  Then you get to the soup, and are tempted to eat it straight from the serving pot. But you can't. Not allowed. Rules are stupid.   So you sit, with your soup and sandwich, and you black out over the next several minutes, and then you look down and your food is gone and you are ludicrously satisfied, forgetting how much you hate these people. And this makes you wonder...  Could all the world's issues be solved by a Soup and Sandwich? Would we all love each other more if we were bound together by the bonds of Chicken Enchilada Chili?  Perhaps, my friends. Perhaps.

This place is like, if MTV came into town, and Xhibit came and Pimped My Ride, except my ride was a Starbucks. Way nicer than the stores in the Chandler area, big interior and plenty of outdoor space, as well as that cool new coffee machine that pretty much fills your drink with extra deliciousness. Much better than the Kiosks in the grocery store, and honestly the local shops are going to need to step up their game to compete.  I hope they do, because our town is more awesome with 3 coffee shops than with just one or two.

This is an awesome charity and an amazing experience. The atmosphere is fun, the work is incredibly organized, and the hosts are passionate and personable. Of course, the cause is amazing, and their solution is downright novel!  I hope they have night events. I can see this being a cool way to spend an evening giving back while having fun. I am also going to be giving here, as they are incredibly efficient with the donations they get (91% goes directly to feeding starving children).

We came here for a team builder, and had an awesome time.  This place is non-descript... like seriously, it feels like you're going to need to escape the waiting room. Instead, you are led to an intricate "study" built with such detail that you soon forget the unassuming exterior. The clues are complex and interesting, and the "reveals" are downright exciting. It requires teamwork and serious thinking, but flows really well overall.  They don't leave you in there forever. It took us a little over an hour, which is very fast for this room. If you need help, they will give you clues (we did not allow them to), but try to do it yourself.  See if you can beat our record of 1:06.

If you frequent the Maricopa Facebook forums, you know just how quickly everyone turns against a new place. Tried this location about a week after it opened, and was already expecting disappointment and the worst food ever. The lesson here is this: Don't listen to the Negative Nancies on Facebook. This place freaking rocks.  They were crazy busy, but incredibly efficient in getting us through the line without feeling rushed. We had great service even as training was obviously still going on, and the food came out quickly. My wife ordered a lettuce wrapped burger, which was pretty good according to her. My bacon cheese steak burger was extremely delicious, and my mom's meal had her raving (same burger, with a chocolate shake). She is a South Texan who likes this place more than the Corpus Christi Whataburgers (they are best in their home city), and that is crazy. The fries are tiny but flavorful, probably the weakest part of the meal. They were still the best in Copa.  The custard (like smooth ice cream) was the perfect ending to the meal, and we shared a big sundae. It was enough for two people to be questioning their life decisions upon finishing.  So yeah, you need to go here. Now. Don't let the Negative Nancies on Facebook tell you otherwise!
