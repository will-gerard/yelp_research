Like I get it.. It's Applebee's and I shouldn't expect a lot but our food was awfulllll. The 13 dollar salmon portion was less than half the size of the picture and all of the vegetables that came with it were obviously frozen with no flavor and a gross feeling in your mouth :/ I would only go here for a cheap drink!! (They aren't strong though so.. Maybe I won't be back)

Went for the first time today and was pleasantly surprised to learn it was a Italian Japanese fusion. I ordered the chicken katsu which was really tender. The salad was also really good. We will be back !

First time expierience here and I enjoyed it! I had the buffet and tried a little bit of everything. The food was pretty good although some of it seemed somewhat bland. Really loved some of the dishes and the dessert. Service was alright, but you don't really need help with a buffet, right? Anyway it was pretty good, but seemed kind of expensive to me? Maybe if I ate more it would seem like a better deal. I'll be back I'm sure.

Original review: So I saw the sign that said "$16.89 spa pedicure" and I knew there was a catch. Feeling risky, I went for it. The catch is that it's nothing fancy and this will no doubt be the fasted pedicure you have ever had.... The massage was so fast that I almost started laughing because of how quickly she was running her hands on my feet and legs.... But it's really not bad if you're cheap like I am haha. So I would recommend only if you need to fix your crusty feet for under 20 dollars and less than 20 minutes! Otherwise I would go somewhere else

Wish we had gone to our regular thai spot. Went with a group of 4 (Asians) and none of us really liked our food it was such a bummer. We left more than half the food on each plate and didn't ask for boxes. They added gratuity so we ended up paying 100 dollars for about 4 plates of food we didn't really enjoy. Bummed about this place!

Food is always good. Service is a little slow but they are super friendly. Thai hot is actually hot! Better then the thai restaurants down town for sure

Really impressed with their food! Tom kra gai thai hot is a must! Also had eggplant with chicken and tofu, also delicious. The only thing I didn't like were the prices? Seems pretty high compared to every other thai place. 15 dollars for a pot of soup?? And another 15 dollars for a normal sized entree? Not feelin that

I'm so confused that I've never written a review. This is my favorite place for coffee and serious chilling or serious homework cramming. All the drinks are fabulous and the food is also really great with options! The wait is usually crazy long so be prepared for that. My favorite part is the decor and ambiance; I love the old little vintage plates they use and the mason jars full of iced coffee while you sit with a friend in big puffy pink chairs. This place is the best. Thank you lux never change

So bummed, heard about this place for years and finally went. Was not a fan of how dirty it was I actually didn't want to put my purse anywhere than my lap! The bathroom is padlocked lol and was so small I just decided it could wait. The food was pretty cheap but still not worth the price. They gave me something different than what I ordered and I know mistakes happen, but once they gave me the correct one I realized the mistake was better! I was really unimpressed and actually a little annoyed. Only reason I give it two stars is because they handled my mistaken food nicely and quickly. Don't recommend

I remember when this location first opened when I was in high school and it was the best forever21 in the valley at that time! I came today after probably a year and was disgusted. Not dirty... Filthy. Gum everywhere, stains, straight up trash and makeup smeared on walls. What the hell I don't feel good about myself shopping in an environment like that. And after spending 45 minutes shopping around not one of the 100 sales people ever greeted me. What happened!!!

After an expensive repair to my vw beetle last summer, I was more than bummed when the dealership service department told me it was going to be a grand to be able to drive again. A couple months of saving and some mechanic shopping, I stumble into this really clean facility where they fix all of these problems for only 488.88! And writhing about 5 hours!    Not only that, but they were genuinely friendly and relaxed and the shop was clean and didn't smell(like all the other ones seem to). They gave me prices of everything else I asked for, so I could save to purchase a new 700 dollar timing belt. I just felt really good about this service! I will definitely be back whenever I need a service done!   HIGHLY recommend this place

For 22 years I was convinced I hated Thai food. Until I ate here and realized I was never eating the right stuff before. Sala thai changed my mind about thai food and now I crave it constantly!   My first visit I was greeted by the server with cool hair who recommended the drunken noodle and it was unbelievable. Now I am obsessed with their yellow chicken curry and thai iced tea. So the food is most important but this is a family business and one I feel great supporting. The guy with cool hair works every time I come in and always has a huge smile on his face. It's nice to see people enjoy their jobs. I only have positive things to say about all of their food, the cleanliness of the restaurant, and the staff. If you haven't been here yet... What are you waiting for?!

Holy shit my mouth is so happy. Tacos were excellent and authentic, not to mention loaded with meat and cheese. The aguas frescas watermelon was so good I swear I heard angels sing when I drank it. You should definitely go try it, all these reviews are no joke man this is the place to get down on some Mexican food

Every time I go to this location they have everything I want in stock, aren't too pushy, and even if the store is packed they are happy to help!

This place a a 5 minute bike ride from my house and really satisfies that bike workout hunger. We had a umrah room and Gouda burger! Say what?! Gouda on a burger??? Yeah I'll take it. It was cooked perfectly how we asked And the sweet potatoes fries really   Made my stomach and soul happy. They had a bunch of crazy deals, and they have jazz Thursday nights! Check it out if you're in the area!

Out of school and starving boyfriend and I headed to thai esan with high hopes and empty bellies. We eat thai basically daily and we happen to work at a really delicious one.   When I saw the outside, I wasn't expecting much. The place looks pretty divey and you would easily miss it. Inside is way different!!! So much decoration! Really interesting to look at everything!   The service was helpful although when my boyfriend ordered thai hot, she assumed he couldn't handle it and said she would give him a level lower hahaha. The food definitely wasn't spicy enough!! But everything was reaaaaallly great. Prices seemed to match the quality and portion we received.   It's on the way home, we will definitely be back again!

Ahhhh why did I not go here sooner?! I've heard about it and seen instagrams about it, finally went today and was not disappointed! It's set up with each little section being a different seller and style. This place felt more selective though, so much of the stuff intrigued me and was begging me to buy it! The best part was the prices were really good for an antique/vintage store! There wasn't anything I picked up to see the price of and thought "what no way" like all the other antique stores out there! The gentlemen at the front were friendly and helpful. I will definitely be back!

Went here for valentines day and it was such a let down :(. I had high hopes with the interesting decor and expensive menu prices but overall I was disappointed. We came late so they were no longer busy but the service was sooo slow. We had to ask for water 10 minutes after she brought us cocktails. Then we had to ask for soy sauce when she brought the sushi. As a server myself, I could tell she was not overly busy just not really on the ball. The kiwi Collins was great but for 10.50 it had little to no alcohol in it?? Same situation for my boyfriends drink. When the food came out 20 minutes later it was really tasty! Unfortunately not worth the high price for the dishes though. I wanted to get dessert but the service was so slow I didn't have time by the end of dinner because they were closing soon and I didn't want to have to stay past that time to eat some sweets. I don't think I'll be back. Such a waste of 60 dollars and a valentines date.

Wow first time eating Cambodian food and this seriously hit the spot! Service was relaxed and helpful and the food was soooo delicious, tender, and well presented. The basil seed drink was pretty good although the guava juice my boyfriend got was better! I highly recommend the chicken wings they are sweet and tender and perfectly crispy! They know what they're doing!

This place is the best when it's cold, but I've had it on a hot summer night and it hits the spot just the same. The crispy chicken rolls are where it's at for appetizers and the half order of pho is generous! Over everything the ambiance here is really chill and relaxing, perfect place for a date or hey pretty much anything else

The line is always long, but it's so worth the wait! I usually try a couple and the flavors are always delicious and unique! The staff is young and very genuinely friendly. The best part is the outdoor seating on a really nice phoenix day and the atmosphere.

Thai basil was closed for an hour, we walked down to my moms thai which was also closed(reallllll annoying) then some guy said there was another thai place around the corner. So this was our 3rd choice and my hope weren't high. The food was really good though! Thai tea was creamy, tom kra gai was full of veggies and the thai hot was actually spicy here. The staff was a little slow but nothing too bad. Glad we stumbled upon this place

Beeeeerrr. This is beer heaven. They have a huge chalk board with all the different beer choices listed. You can also get flights and choose 6, but you can ask your server to fill it out if you have no idea what to order like me haha. The IPAs are really good and strong. The food is tasty and pairs perfect with the beer. The only problem is the service is sooooo slow, I get that it's really busy but we had to wait way too long I between seeing our server on more than one visit! Still staff is friendly, drinks are incredible and the people are a good mix.

Heard so much about this place and finally went with some friends! They were really busy on a Sunday night so we sat outside to sit faster. I would recommend sitting inside unless it's a nice day out, because I felt like we lost a lot of the atmosphere.     The food was incredible! We got 3 pizzas and shared them(and also took home lots of leftovers). The sweet potato pizza and the prosciutto pizza were the best and I would highly recommend them!! The service was really attentive even though they were clearly very busy and the price seemed to match the quality!

I feel bad writing a one star review but come on! I went in today after wanting to try this place for forever. There was no line and nobody waiting. The lady in front of us ordered two bagels and we waited for probably ten minutes. Then someone came in and asked if they had started making the bagels they ordered 30 minutes ago(for 2 asiago bagels!), we already waited 10,so we just walked out. The service was way too slow! Hopefully next time I go it will be much faster and I can give this place a better review!

I had a terrible one star first experience and went back to give them another try. I was not disappointed, the service was fast and efficient and the food came out so good!!! What I like most is a bagel sandwich is less than 5 bucks and full of good stuff!

We ordered and waited for our food and after two different tables were seated, placed their orders, received their food, paid and left and we still did not have our food yet. Although when it finally arrived it was really worth the wait! The name Omg French toast is very fitting as my boyfriend said "oh my god" after the first bite. The Bella Bella Benny was superb and the apple juice AMAZING. I was going to give this 4 stars because the wait, but before we left our server brought us a complementary hot chocolate for being so patient and that small gesture really turned by review around!

I like this location much more than others I've been to. The staff is really friendly, it is kept clean and all the equipment is brand new. I think the best part is it's usually pretty empty in there!

Officially a regular at this spot, I have tried multiple dishes by now. It's pretty authentic and delicious! The lunch specials are great you end up getting a lot of food for like 9 bucks ! Everything I've tried is good and the service is also really friendly and as efficient as they can be in a tiny place like this.
