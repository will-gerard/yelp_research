I hesitate to write this review because as much as I want success for some of these culinarily perfect grub spots out in Phoenix, I also don't want it to get any busier than it does. I like that they're placed in a neighborhood, it's just a little diner that seems like it's always been there. With the community dining, eclectic patio furniture and the always engaging staff this place really exemplifies what food should be. Good, local and comfortable. It's one of the few...actually ONLY respectable restaurants that I can walk into on a Friday and Saturday at 7pm without a 2 hour wait or calling ahead for a reservation. I hope welcome diner is preserved forever, it's definitely my favorite part of Arizona food culture.

I haven't had a night out like this since Living in SF. These ladies had so much vibrance and personality! The show started slightly after 10:30 and I went in on a Friday to celebrate a friends birthday it was worth the wait! Drinks were cheap but the performance was not. The dive bar ambiance gave it a very comfortable feel, don't expect anything fancy except from the ladies. Small parking lot but lots of places to park nearby though! Kudos to the staff! We had a great night :)

I've loved this place since I was little! Other than it being my first job their quality of food has never ever changed. Everything is made fresh every single day. In over 15 years coming here every bagel I've had has been delicious. I always see them involved with the local schools, employing the local high school students and always friendly faces. I love seeing pat and Michelle every morning. Support local business go to Lox Stock!

THANK YOU Poor Boy Termite, not only did I find myself with pesky termites but I had dry-woods AND subterranean (just my luck) I called and tried to price match with other companies just to make sure I was getting a good deal but Terminex never came out for the appointment I set, Action told me there is no way I could possibly have 2 types of termites and Bills Termites never even called me back. Poor Boy came out within 48hours and showed me exactly where the termites were in my wall with their thermal imaging camera so cool! So they knew exactly where to treat and almost 1 year later still no termites! They are very knowledgable about the pesticide thy use and answers allllll my questions if yore looking for an Eco friendly service and don't have to worry about pets or other critters getting into it call poor boy!This is a great family business I definitely recommend calling them, termites like bed bugs are something you don't want to mess around with or cheap out on. Totally worth the money and got a great deal on a 5year warranty. Thanks Poor Boy!

We came here (22 of us) to surprise my mom for her birthday. We already love Charleston's for their food and service but they were able to accommodate my huge family and Brittany and Kevin did a wonderful job! I've been a server for many years and they did a top notch job dealing with such a large group. I never saw an empty glass all of our dishes came out right, plates were cleared in a timely manner and they even cut the cake, served it and washed the cake holder for me! Normally chain restaurants tend to let me down with poor customer service and unprofessional servers but Charleston's truly impressed us. Thank you so much for a great evening!

If I could rate this hotel 0 stars I would. I do not feel safe here security and evacuation procedures are not in place. On Monday September 8th around 4:15 on the 28th floor the fire alarm went off. After trying to call the front desk (got put on hold) we got dressed and left our room about 5 minuets later and ran into a frantic woman in the hallway with no idea what to do. We proceeded to head down the stairs (which were not labeled well very small exit sign. There was no alarm in the stair well, no signage for emergency procedure and no way to know what was going on. No security in the stair well, nothing. Once we got down to the 2nd floor we hit a dead end there was a locked door and one that led to a roof again not very much signage, yellow arrows on the ground not very visible with the 2in of rain flooding the roof. After much confusion we reached another stair well and got outside. We got downstairs and the first 3 hotel employees we spoke with had no idea there was an alarm going off. This includes a hotel manager. She offered to change our rooms gave us $50 to spend at the hotel and passed us off to another front desks assistant Melinda who was very nice and undertaking. After continuing to voice our concern, worry and still shaking she informed us that it was a false alarm (which we would have known if there were alarms and speakers in the stairs). We asked to speak to a manager again because the first woman had gone home. This is when things took a turn for the worse. Ryan Ramsey came our flat faced and dry nodding quietly to my friends concerns only escalating our frustration. He interrupted her, told her we weren't getting an upgrade and said he didn't know what else to do, it wasn't his fault there weren't enough security guards. We were trying to voice our concern about security procedures and he made us feel stupid. He didn't smile apologize or even try to de escalate the situation he gladly handed over his "managers" business card and seemed glad to pass the burden along. All we were trying to do is show our perspective in the faults in security and emergency procedures at the hotel and he didn't seem to care. The bell hop and house keeping manager we dealt with were very nice and understanding. Obviously this hotel is not equipped for any sort of emergency situation I no longer feel safe staying here and after multiple calls and attempts at voicing our concerns yelp is the only place we can be heard.

They did a wonderful job of putting on a show, attending to all of the guests and making sure everything was running smoothly. We attended to celebrate my friends birthday, they took care of her gluten sensitivity so well. They made her feel special and all the other guests who were celebrating. We had a lot of fun!

Reasons why I hate Dutch bros:  Customer service: No this does not mean asking me how my day was, it Means SERVING me my drink. Most of the time the person taking my order is too involved with asking me about my nose ring than making sure my order is right. It's usually wrong and I don't have the time to wait to make it right. Not my job - your job  Time management: I have worked in retail, coffee shops, restaurants etc. I get you have busy days, someone shows up late, you get a rush..whatever. The lines are Dutch bros are not just long they are SO SLOW. The counter is worse. Management is spending 0 time training these employees they are literally just making shit and throwing it out there and crossing their fingers you're happy. Implement systems it's business basics.  Answering the phone: This seems pretty easy, except it's not. I recently had a client who really likes Dutch bros she wanted to place a large order for an event ahead of time. I called and called and called. I called 5 locations and not a single one had a working phone number OR ever answered. OR returned my voice mails. Guess who answered their phone? Starbucks. Sorry I'm not sorry!  Management: Or lack there of. I physically went into a store to talk with a manager (if they even have those) attempting to get a phone number, name or contact person to place said large order. The "girl in charge" said "we kind of just text each other so like I can't just give you her personal number". So this "manager" texted the other "manager" my request for a large amount of K cups and coffee and assured me it would be there and ready to pick up the next day. Even though I crossed my fingers and toes guess what? I went to go pick up my order and they had absolutely no idea what I was talking about. Guess where I ended up? Starbucks. They took care of me in under 15 minuets without disrupting their other customers or making anyone wait longer for me and my large last minuet order.   I've tried so hard to give you guys my business but instead of texting this to one of your managers I had to result to Yelp.   See you never Dutch Bros!

Go see Daniela! This girl really knows what's she's doin. I came in a few months ago desperately in need of a cut and really wanting some purple in my hair. She found the perfect balance between subtle but PURPLE. She blended it perfectly and gave me an easy to manage haircut. When my roots started to grow out I didn't have to freak, she fit me into her schedule super quick and fixed me up. I love my haircut even more than I did the first time and I didn't even think that was possible! She has so many talents definitely give her a shot if you're lookin' for a new style she's amazing :)

Tried the new location tonight. I probably wouldn't have come in if I knew it was their very first night open. I was a loyal customer at their old location but I don't know what happened to their stellar servers. We sat down quickly, were greeted and brought drinks our server was very nice, we ordered within 10 minuets of sitting down. Unfortunately for the next 45 minuets we waited and waited for our food. First their server told us they were making new waffle batter, then that the chicken tenders were made from scratch so the reason we had to wait longer for our food than the other 5-6 tables that sat down before us was because they ran out of batter and chicken tenders take forever. I don't know for certain if that was the truth because a manager never came over to talk to us or let us know what was happening. It was frustrating seeing people who ordered over 15 minuets after us get their food and almost finish. Unfortunately we ended up leaving after no real explanation or eta on the food. We still paid for our drinks though but unfortunately we won't be back for awhile. Hopefully lolos gets it together. I saw the manager adjusting our bill but no effort to come over and apologize or anything. Being in the industry so long myself I feel like someone dropped the ball tonight not sure who but we were very disappointed.

They always provide top quality service! Fair pricing and they are a pleasure to do business with. They explain things clearly so I can really understand the information they are giving me.  I'll be back :)

Julie and her employees are wonderful. I have lived in this area for years and I've learned my lesson, every time I try and go somewhere else Julie always ends up fixing them. No where else will you get such attention to detail, polite customer service and 100% customer satisfaction. She truly cares about every single one of her customers experience, I am so happy for them and their re-model. I don't mind spending the extra twenty minuets here or paying an extra $5-$8 from the cheaper places in the neighborhood. If you're ever disappointed with something (nothing's perfect!) if you mention it Julie will do everything to make sure your satisfied.

Ella Ella Ella! She did a wonderful job this past Saturday with my hair! This girl had so much passion for what she does she explained to me everything about the service, stayed within the quoted time, made sure I was comfortable and made me look like a rockstar. I love that this place is smaller than other dry bars in the area. It was quaint and peaceful, exactly what I needed last Saturday. They even have happy hour pricing during the week (BONUS). I did get there a little early and she hadn't quite gotten there yet, when I realized it was a small operation I totally understood I work for a small business myself. Call ahead and book an appointment with Ella she will make you shine!

This place was amazing! I came here with a friend for a business trip and as soon as we got into town and they got us in quickly on a Saturday! Not only did I get a gel manicure and pedicure (at the same time) I also got a waxing all under 45min! The service and quality of the services were not comped. These guys did a great job and I got to my appointment with time to spare. We will definitely be back here next time were in town!

I have frequented this place the past few months. As I was finishing dinner with my mom an employee walked up to us and informed us we had ordered too much food and that there would be an extra charge.  I was completely taken aback. At an all you can eat restaurant there is a penalty for having leftovers?  He continued to explain that they discourage people from ordering too much food and that next time I should pace myself because there are third world countries...I politely cut him off and asked him where the notice of this extra charge was.   I have been in the food service industry for almost 6 years I have never experienced more disrespect and outright terrible service. I was embarrassed (everyone in the section looked over at us) and I will never come back to the restaurant ever again.

I'm gonna be honest I solely came to this place because of the bacon popcorn. I couldn't help myself I had to try it. Although it's not really set up for dinner per say with the minimal dining areas not intended for groups and the terribly loud mediocre band. But I didn't expect too much. We tried the pigs in a blanket (hard to mess up) but delicious and the poutine fries (delicious but hard to mess up). The flatbread was a different story...pre-packaged frozen pre cooked chicken, gross. The whole thing, stay away. Although it was very slow (about 20-30) people in the whole place including the staff. We were greeted promptly, taken care of well and never ignored perfect steps of service (Thanks Serena you were awesome!) and delicious drinks (I tried the Clyde). Also the popcorn was exactly what I expected bacony, sweet and delicious.

My boyfriend and I have been so excited to try this place! We are loyal customers at Welcome Diner and couldn't wait to get over here. We got here about 25min before they started serving chicken. We ordered the maple bacon donut (duh) and the blueberry cream cheese donut. Maple bacon was deeeeelicious. The frosting (especially the blueberry cream cheese) was super sweet, one bite at a time, we barely finished them. The fresh coffee helped wash them down! We ended up waiting until the chicken was being served (ThankGod we did). I don't know where to start or end on this stuff, the outside was fried to perfection without being too greasy, or salty it was seasoned to perfection and fried at the perfect temperature (I really appreciate the love they put into their chickens). Once you get inside, the chicken was so tender and moist it melted in my mouth! We tried both the Japanese bbq and Vietnamese sauce (on the side) they were very good but very strong in flavor I loved the chicken so much I didn't think it needed sauce! This was definitely worth the drive we will be back!

Attention: The dough dilemma has been fixed. You can now resume your regular donut consumption!  But really, I read and heard some reviews about the dough being a little off, technically since they weren't really open yet I won't hold it against them. Located right where kingdom donuts used to be (1000ft from my house) these guys know local food! I have to say there are some holes in the design (pun intended?), they're working on getting some of their proverbial shit together but all in all A for effort (and taste). I do suggest you do something with the chocolate glaze cause that just wasn't happening for me today but other than that I can't complain! For your first official day open   I'll definitely be back, and if you guys started out this good I can't wait to see you when you're all grown up. Props for the  customer service everyone was warm and welcoming in the teeny tiny little shop can't wait to try more flavors!

Delicious meal! I understand the the higher prices come at the cost of eating predominantly local fresh ingredients. I am 100%ok with this! We ordered the bacon onion tart with delicious tomatoes baked on top. Amazing. Our meals were delicious, both the pork loin and catfish were tasty. Beautiful set up, not too crowded and loved the booths. Can't wait for the full patio to open up. Great job, we will be back!
