I haven't been to many Souper Salads, but I wasn't too impressed by this location.  I understand they have a lot of customers, and not much staff, but but they should find some way to improve some things.  First of all, there have been several times when I have walked in, and no one is at the counter. Once, when my family arrived, we had to serve ourselves, then find the cashier afterward to pay, because they didn't arrive at the register until after we had sat down to eat. Because of this very lax staffing, I've seen several people walk in through the door, and go straight to the seats or the bathroom. I don't know if they were trying to sneak in a free meal, but there was nothing stopping them if they were.  Secondly, they don't clean the tables too often. I'm sure it's related to the small staff, but it's also not usually a problem because there's so much seating.  Usually you cut staff to save money, but if you lose customers to dirty tables, no one being at the register when they arrive, or simply too many people sneaking in to steal food, it might be more profitable to have sufficient staff.

A very good place to have lunch with a friend or some co-workers. Our office eats here often, and let me tell you how commendable it is to be able to get orders right when you have 9 or more people ordering at a time!   They have a fairly good selection, and they're flexible with alterations to your order. The daily soups and specials are also always changing, and are great for adding variety.  I've met the owner several times, and he's a very nice and friendly guy. You can tell when someone is being nice just because you're a customer, and when they're just a good person who happens to run a restaurant, and he's definitely the latter!

One of the best locally owned sandwich shops I've been to in phoenix. I've been coming here for years, and they have always had quality ingredients.  They're fairly quick to make their food, even with large orders during lunch hour. They will not hesitate to whip up a custom order as long as they have the ingredients for it. They're equally zippy with their catering, and the food looks just as good as in the pictures!  I order through their website so I don't even have to pick up the phone. I sort of wish they didn't change their soups daily, but I do admit that I enjoy the variety (same for their teas). They always have chili on hand, however, which is one of the best I've had.  For what you pay for, you get a sizable sandwich, and if you order a drink, they are generous with the refills. It's difficult to order from here and not be both full and happy!

Let me start this off by saying that I am not a coffee person at all, and even if I was, I would not be a Starbucks customer. With that being said, I often run to this location to get drinks for my boss and co-workers quite often since it is so close, and have been going for years.  First off, the the outside area is large and spacious, and is kept clean just like the inside. Secondly, the staff there are very kind and courteous, I've become familiar with many of them over the years, and some even manage to remember my boss's "special" drink order, out of who knows how many orders they see every day! They are also very hard workers, as even when the line of customers reaches all the way to the door, they still manage to move the line quickly, and I've never had to wait very long to get my order.

Good variety, and very high quality food. I come by for the all-you-can-eat buffet just about every weekend and I am in love with the Chicken Tikki Masala. Good selection of imported ingredients from India in the store next to the restaurant shows that these people know their stuff!

Do not come here for their salads! They are very small, and the toppings are extremely meager. There was around only an ounce of chicken. I could have easily confused it with a side salad. The wait time was also almost 45 minutes for 8 orders, which is very inconvenient if you take into consideration that they don't do pick-up orders from 11am to 2 pm!

Strike 1: Does not pick up their phone promptly. Had to call three different times after the first two calls rang 8+ times while trying to place a pick up order. Strike 2: Either does not understand English well or is hard of hearing. Have to repeat almost half of my orders even after speaking slowly and clearly. Strike 3: Order is not ready by their pick up time, and even then, they didn't even get some orders right  Very sloppy service, sub-par ingredients. I wouldn't have returned if it wasn't for a co-worker who wanted to specifically order from there again, but I ran into the same issues both times.

Just got off the phone after attempting to call them five times in a row. Each time the call just ends after the the 8th ring. But that's not the only problem:  I've ordered for my office several times, and it's rare for them to get an entire list of orders correct without mistakes. On top of that, I ask if they can put names on the orders, so it's easier to tell who got what without having to open the packages or peek inside the sandwiches themselves. They tell me that it's something they'll have to do when I pick it up, and sure enough, they make me wait while they try to figure out what each item is so they can name it. Why they don't just do this as they make them is beyond me  For how long we wait for the food, and for how much we pay for it, they quality is average at best. The quality ranges from sub-par to so-so.  The store is also very tight like other reviewers say. You have to squeeze through the line as you enter the main doors, and if you wait for pick-up as I do, you'll have to continually move out of the way of people trying to get down the tiny corridor in the middle. Combined with the very limited parking, this place crowds very easily, and is not recommended for the claustrophobic.

Great greek food with fast and high quality service. Everything I tried was delicious! The food is reasonably priced, and they have a good history of getting all of our office orders right, which is a rarity nowadays it seems!
