Great family experience!  Most knowledgeable eye doctor I've ever been to.  Dr. Ryan was great with the kids and very accurate with all of our prescriptions.

Had whole family of 5 for breakfast.  My son had a hair in his burrito, they simply took it back and remade it.  It came out when the rest of us were all done.  My son lost his appetite and they didn't even offer to take it off the bill.  They have punch cards for a free desert and wouldn't punch it per meal?  We had 6 meals and two deserts and received one punch on the card.  When I asked, they said one punch per visit.  Live in the neighborhood, won't be going back or recommending it to anyone who lives around here....

We've been using Duke's of Air since they started, everytime we call them they go out of their way to insure the problem is solved and check for any additional issues.  They are one company that hasn't forgot about customer service, thanks for taking care of your customers!

Great store, tired of going to Leslie's where everything is overpriced and high pressure sales people.  These guys tell you what's up and give you the cheapest option.  They price matched my cartridges $100 less than what Leslie's was charging.  Recently my in floor cleaning valve broke, Leslie's $232, NPS-169 (price match).  It's 3 miles farther away from my house but worth this place has already saved me a few hundred bucks and they don't annoy me when I walk in the door.......

Rip off....5 year old 42" LG tv $322 to replace the power supply after the $85 estimate fee.  Can buy a brand new 42" for $299.  Do not use this company

Best dental experience ever!!!  Professional, friendly and will actually work with you to take care of your dental needs quickly and efficiently.  I needed a crown and they were able to do it the same day, no temporary crown to deal with for three weeks and hope the permanent one fits.  The staff explains everything thoroughly and are very personable.  Time to bring back the whole family!
