For my second to last day of vacation here in Phoenix, I decided to try this place for lunch and let me tell you, this is a must visit to this place. I had the lunch portion of the Alfredo in the Dark pasta and it was filling. I wouldn't dare to order the dinner portion for lunch unless you are REALLY hungry. I highly recommend this place when visiting or living in Phoenix.  The staff is very friendly and helpful. They are excellent with their service and great waitstaff.

This location for Supercuts is not the best experience I had.  The stylist that shaved my head was not knowledge and was too afraid to use the hair clippers to shave down to stubbles.  He was not that great but friendly and nice guy.  I would hope they can shape things up to have better stylists and knowledgeable.

This place is completely off my list.  The atmosphere is OK as it looks dim and not the best area to wait for a table when they should be on the look out of guests waiting to be serviced.  Even the hostess walks back into the kitchen when she CLEARLY sees there is a line waiting.  Anyway, the waitress sat us down at a table with grill and we ordered BBQ combo for 2 as it was little worth the money plus an appetizer.  You would think they bring out the appetizer first BEFORE the main entree.  Then, we started grilling and about 10 min later, the grill stopped working.  Hmm....guess they don't do enough maintenance on the grills all the time. They offer to move us to another table or fix the grill....why do you offer to fix the grill in middle of dinner?  The waitress took the food inside the kitchen and cook it but guess how long that took.....15 to 20 min!   This was a very disappointing experience for Korean BBQ grill as I had only been living here for 6 months and this place is for sure going down the drain with the customer service they provided and the hostess not being there to greet customers as they walk in.  Sorry, OHYA you lost business and continue to go down no matter what.

I have been here twice, once for dinner and once for brunch.  I do like the ambience of the place because it provides that great welcome feeling.  The food is pretty good here and I haven't been here enough to try out other things on the menu so am planning on visiting here often.  The parking lot is easy access plus some street parking and I like the fact they are next to an awesome ice cream place when you feel the need for a big dessert.  Going to be at Windsor a little more to try out other things.

Well this would be a good go to place for something quick and easy for lunch especially when you work around the Via De Linda area.  The price is decent for lunch when you can get Curry or Pad Thai around $8 when getting either chicken, beef, or veggies but a little more for seafood and all.  I usually get either yellow or green curry as it has good flavor and medium spice is good but I feel they are lacking something in their flavor altogether.  Overall, the staff is nice and accommodating and the decor is not bad for being a small Thai restaurant and quick service.  I would recommend for ones who needs something quick for lunch when working around there but going there often, it would be better off to find a place that offers a little better flavor in their food.

You can't go wrong with this place as it is literally up the street from my apartment.  The flavor of the broth on the Pork Ramen is very similar to my mom's cooking and it's just perfect!  Loved the soft shell crab they have as an appetizer and it taste similar at an authentic Chinese restaurant with slight alteration to the taste but still LOVE IT!!  I would go there at least once a week if not twice since I can be a little lazy to cook at home after coming home from work late.  I recommend this place to anyone.  The staff is amazing, they know my name, and always excellent service every time I am there!  :-)
