The prices are high (even with sales and coupons) but the selection is great. I'm used to being at the whim of whichever store I buy from when it comes to sizing. Here? I can get as much as I want but the prices will get you.  The staff is top notch. Everyone is friendly and helpful. I will say that Harbor Bay's stuff seems to shrink significantly even when we are doing cold wash and line drying. So it may be worth getting a tall size even if you are not tall. Other than that, I limit myself to a couple trips per year because otherwise I wouldn't have much of a paycheck left!

My wife and I are experimenting with biking. The store looks like a toy store for cycling enthusiasts. They offered to do a maintenance/repair package that we would have used had we been able to fit out bikes into our car.  In the end we both came in simply to buy helmets (I'll never understand people not wearing helmets on motorcycle of bicycles especially if you are riding outside of just subdivisions). They staff never pressured us to look at new bikes. They were helpful. We got nice helmets for a reasonable price. And they didn't try and upsale the helmets either. A year from now when we are ready to commit to new bikes, we'll definitely consider coming back.

It has been a few months and the bike bug has taken hold. My comfort bike was leaving me wanting more speed and power but my weight is currently above the recommended max for most road bikes including the Domane 4 or 5 series I'm drooling over.  So I sold my shift and picked up a used hybrid to keep me losing and exercising. It was not a manufacturer that SWB sells but I've learned to like this store so my wife and keep coming back. Jeff has helped me with my 10 year old Sirrus twice including giving me only what I needed. Once I just needed a puncture resistant tube instead of a higher quality tire. Another time my chain kept dropping when I'd switch to the lowest ring on the chainset. If Jeff wanted he probably could've sold me a chainset but instead just kept me riding by making a simple (for him) repair.  While coming in he helped me with sunglasses when I was tired of cheap frames breaking. I came in looking at a pair of Tifosi glasses but he suggested another pair.  My saddle was a bit too narrow and I was looking for a change. I was staring at a Bontrager saddle and he handed me a Serfas that was cheaper and will hopefully fit my body and riding style better. He even told my wife to try adjusting her bike first before replacing her saddle.  This is not a store or an owner out to make a quick buck. This is a local business and an owner that wants lifelong and happy customers. Currently I am down 22 lbs. I need to drop at least 47 more to get under the suggested weight limit for a carbon frame bike. There is a part of me interested in a particular bike that SWB does not carry. But after the past few months I am more interested in buying from here. So in about 20-30 weeks I hopefully will get to try out a Domane 4 or 5 series and start doing things I've always thought were impossible.... like hopefully a century ride next spring.

I haven't bowled in years but always loved to. Since the last time I was in a league, one thing has changed to make the experience far better: No more smoking in bowling alleys. It is amazing how much more enjoyable it was without the smell of smoke.  Now for this location. Everyone here was friendly. The place was spotless. The computer system offered suggestions on making splits (yeah... I'm totally going to hit that 7-10 by doing that) and it was just a fun environment. It felt lively and upbeat but our group could all still talk comfortably.  The food was the best I've had at a bowling alley. I used to be in leagues all the time as a kid, teenager, and even 1 or 2 after moving out here. So I've had my share of alley food. And this was the best. The only thing I missed was fried mushrooms. We always got those on one of my teams when I was young. So I always associate bowling with friend mushrooms. But no, dice here.  Decent number of taps and fair prices on drinks. Contrary to popular belief, a couple large Kilt Lifters did not improve my score later games.  Best location I've been to in the valley and I'd consider going back again with a group (even if it is a bit of a drive).

REI is always full of staff that knows the products, is helpful, and all without being pushy. We went in to ask some questions about bike maintenance. We had our questions answered without ever having anyone try and push us into a pair of new bikes that just aren't in the budget right now. In the end, we tried someone else to do our repairs but will keep REI in mind in the future.  We've bought shoes and camping equipment from REI stores. And the garage sales CAN be worth the trip of members. The last garage sale I went to at this location is the only reason I'm not giving this store a 5. That was a clusterfu... clusterclump.

I remember growing up with parents that loved Best Buy. They had a Best Buy card. The store was always a cool place to just wander. The staff was helpful and plentiful. The prices were pretty darned good.  Nowadays? Finding staff is almost impossible. The layout of the new store is a royal pain. You need to ask for directions to checkout. The staff that is there rarely seems to be able to give specific and useful information about products. And they are constantly upselling. We ask about a tablet and are told about a "better" more expensive model. Geek squad? Hah! I will admit that I've used them in the past. And it generally seems like there is 1 person that really knows his stuff. But then there are 4 more that seem like they are reading cue cards. And the work is shoddy. I was stumped by issues with my old PC at one point. When I got it back, they forgot to reconnect one of the connections to my video card (or maybe forgot on purpose so I'd come back?) and the ties that I had on all of my wires to help air flow did not get reused. Wires were all over the place. And this was a full sized tower. Prices I can't really blame them for. Amazon and Newegg don't need a brick and mortar store. But if I'm going to pay a premium, I expect better service. I feel that I get better service from Newegg reviews than I do from paid Best Buy employees.  If I really want to get my hands on something electronic, I'll just go to Fry's. At least there is a bigger selection there and the layout (generally) makes sense. I'll just try and remember Best Buy for the store it was when I bought my first PC from them. From when I got my copy of Diablo 2 from them. Not as the store it is today.

This is our odds and ends shop.  At Joe's we tend to buy:  Olive oil. Several different brands. I've heard that Trader Joe's brand products are simply other companies with their label. But after our old go-to olive oil raised their price 1 too many times we decided to buy one of each of their brand and taste. The Spanish oil seems to have enough flavor for me (I tend to like stronger oils. My favorite is picual when I'm heading to a specialty store) but keep a decent price.  $3 Chuck. I've heard that this isn't the same stuff that used to win awards. But the shiraz is pretty good and most of the varieties seem work great for cooking. The wife tends to like sweeter wines and I tend to favor either a beer or a gin and seltzer (gave up pop a while back so no tonic for me). So we don't buy Chuck for drinking usually.  Pasta. The pasta selection here is pretty good. They have a variety of shapes depending on what you need and many cost $1/lb.  Those are our Joe staples. Other things that we get include chocolate (damn you impulse shopping!), basil, occasionally cream, and occasionally cheeses (nice cheese selection!).  The store is clean and organized. The staff is friendly and the lines usually move pretty well. There is usually some sample for food (or wine on weekends). And our cats love when we bring home paper bags.  The only bad experience we ever had was when we walked up to someone that was doing a wine tasting. At the time I believe both me and my wife were 29. The lady in charge gave us a dirty look and stared at us for a few seconds. Eventually, she asked if we wanted to taste (this was after we said hello and waited for her to convince us). She carded us (Yay! I didn't look 30!). But the look she gave us made it seem like she "knew" we were underage. She was friendly to the person that came behind us so we must have given her a bad vibe or something. But it was the only bad experience I've had at this location since moving to the valley.

We came with a group of Yelpers and this place delivers. Get the spring rolls. I don't know which but just get some. They were amazing. The phos were good. Probably the second best I've had in the valley.   The place is popular and deserves it. But just keep in mind that it can get crowded and chaotic. Definitely one of the best pho experiences I've had around here.

Chris knows his stuff, is friendly, comes to you, and offers great prices. Oh and he obviously has a great first name.  The Bike Doctor came within 24 hours of our call. He got my ~30 year old Huffy and my wife's ~25 year old bike up and running. The had been sitting in a hot, Phoenix garage through 10 summers with no use, and no maintenance. They were purchased at a garage sale before that in Michigan before coming here.  And now they run great. Chris replaced our seats with something far more comfortable and told us about the bikes. And all told the price was lower than bike shops that we would've had to travel to.  He accepts Paypal, cash and check. If you need to use plastic, have a paypal account ready. If you need a tuneup, seriously. Call this guy!

Wong's service some of the best Chinese food I've had in the valley. My wife loves their garlic chicken while I've tried many dishes and enjoyed everything I've had. Their sizzling rice soup is a bit lighter than some other places but still serves 2 as an appetizer.   The prices have gone up over the years but are still not overboard. I agree with others saying that the water can be, at times dusty. But I usually drink the tea with dinner anyway.  Wong's is never backed up out the door so you can get in any day, even on Valentine's which has turned into a silly tradition with me and the wife. And the service is always friendly.  Overall I think 4 stars fits the bill. Not "You have to go" but definitely pretty darned good.

Best Greek food I've had in the valley. Whenever I order a gyro anywhere else, I'm disappointed. The only reason I'm not giving a 5 is nit picky items:  This is a family owned restaurant that has many regulars. If you are not a regular, you may not feel quite as... welcome? That said, the staff is great when you get to know them but it may be a turn off for new customers.  I love grape leaves but thought Golden Greek's was just mediocre.  I'll take a gyro dinner here over a many other more expensive meals at "nicer" restaurants. And after going here for 8 years I still have never tried any of the Italian... maybe one day.

I was shocked when I first moved to the valley and saw Fry's for the first time. The place is huge. If you are a computer nerd or any kind of electronics nut, this is a wonderful toy store. If you are in the market for a desktop, consider buying parts from Newegg or Amazon and paying the staff to build it. Chances are you will still get more power for less money than a prebuilt tower!  The store now price matches online retailers. Between that and Amazon finally charging Arizona state sales tax, there is no longer a huge disparity in price between Fry's and Amazon.  Now for the 2 star part. One of the big complaints people have about Best Buy is lack of floor staff. For years, that didn't seem to be a problem at Fry's. But my last couple of trips are now mirroring Best Buy. Today we went to get a Roku box. We stood in line for about 20 minutes with 2 people in front of us to ask for help finding one. They were not with the DVD players, the TVs, or even the Google boxes. Several employees walked by but none were the "manager" on the picture, none offered to help anyone waiting for help, none even said anything to us.   Eventually someone asked if we needed anything. We told him we were looking for a Roku box. He asked how much we were looking to spend and we said about $100 and that we were looking for the Roku 3. The first thing he said was to double our budget and we could get a Google box. Eventually he told us where to find the Rokus (other side of the store... with internal PC hard drives for some reason).  To anyone at Fry's that may read this. I appreciate that your prices are as good as anyone else's. But why would I drive halfway across the valley to go to your location, be ignored, wander around aimlessly for half an hour, and then have to drive home? That lack of service is what is killing Best Buy. I'll just sit at home and wait for my from Prime shipping if this is the service I can expect. Which is a shame because this store really is just a giant toy store and is tons of fun to browse. But it's full of frustration to shop now.

This review is a comparison to other take out places. Ming Gee is one of the best Chinese takeout restaurants I've ever eaten at. Whether I'm picking up or ordering delivery, the staff is always friendly and the food is great. In all of the times I've ordered, I have only ever had 1 mistake which they fixed. My wife loves the sizzling rice soup and the fried rice is a major weakness of mine.  A slight warning. They will deliver outside of their area but there is a delivery charge for each mile outside of the area. That said, the prices are fair and the food is good.

Great prices. Great food. Friendly staff. I love their tomatoes, corn, watermelon, etc during the summer. Those funky looking cucumbers are great when I want something crunchy. Last year they had apples for a couple of days. I wish they could get more!  Parking can be annoying at times. And I've heard mixed reviews about some of the activities. But the produce stand is exactly what I want. The brandywine tomatoes ALMOST makes the summers here worth it. Almost.

Starbucks has done 1 thing I'm thankful for. My parents' generation had to deal with cheap diner coffee. Robusto beans which were cheap, high and caffeine, and make awful coffee. Starbucks helped to popularize higher quality beans in this country.  That said I am not a fan. I gave up drinking pop 3 years ago. Black coffee is my replacement. That means I need something that has good flavor and is not too bitter. That requires light to medium roast and fresh beans.  This location? Or all Starbucks for that matter? Dark roast. Very dark. It is great when you want an espresso drink or something sugary as a desert. But when I just want a plain and tasty coffee in the morning or afternoon? Thanks but most diners these days have better plain coffee.  Come here if you want desert or need a pick me up and have no other option. Otherwise, not so much. The staff at this (and most) locations are nice. But it is not quite the experience I remember from even 5-10 years ago.

I came very close to giving this place 3 stars. I went with the wife and some friends during reverse happy hour. Friends made reservations. We got there, were seated and asked for a happy hour menu. At that point, we were told that we had to be at the bar for the happy hour. Thankfully, they managed to get us some seats. If we could not get seats, then that would've been the 3 star review.  Now for the good. The sushi was great. The location looks and feels like a ton of fun. Check in on Yelp to get some edamame. Friends with Benefits rolls were good if you like a little heat. We had a drink, 4 orders of sushi, and edamame for $45 after tax and tip for 2 people.  The bar does call out drinks. They have Hendrick's Gin which is always a selling point in my book. It was a "super premium" which means that a gin and tonic was $7 but I did order 1 and enjoyed it. They were not skimpy with the alcohol. It tasted as good and strong as anything I would've mixed at home. A friend ordered a red bull and vodka. The drink was clear. Seems like they gave her vodka with a splash of red bull. The bar's prices can be pricey but they are generous with the booze! The bar experience was 4-5 stars. The teppan tables looked entertaining. We may have to try them next time!

I've been here twice with the wife.  The first time I ordered a couple spring rolls and loved them so much that (for a while) we started making them at home a few times per week.  I also did the make your own spring roll for the dinner and... it was filling. Fair price and can easily feed 2 people. The staff came and offered to show me how to roll them (I've done it in the past so I declined).  My wife's noodle dish was great. She may have got pad thai but I forget. And the boba is great and has many flavors to choose from.  On our next trip we ordered the firepot soup to split and again... filling. Fair price. Good food. Definitely worth a trip into downtown Glendale.

It's a supermarket. 5 stars? Really? This review is about the service and staff at this particular Sprouts.  Every single employee here acts professionally and is very helpful. People seem to actually enjoy their job and it gives this store a vibe that I haven't felt at other locations.  As for Sprouts in general. The bulk pantry area, spices, and coffee beans are a great place to get some of our staples that cost far more at other stores. And the sandwiches are a great deal if you want a filling lunch that isn't a grease bomb. If more grocery stores were like this Sprouts, I'd enjoy shopping more!

I started shopping here about 6 or 7 years ago. I'd come in during lunch breaks to look at a couple of 40k minis and talk to one of the employees. One day I came in with my wife and we asked about a board game night and found that they meet every Thursday.  Since then I've met many friends and had years of great times at IOG.  I've been going to gaming stores for about 15 years. The owner of Outpost, Darren, is the friendliest and one of the most knowledgeable that I've met. Darren has a huge selection of board games, minis, RPGs, and even helped the neighboring Magic store get started. Him and his staff are always there to answer questions, recommendations, or just chat.  The store has hosted events, worked with local conventions, and even helped with a food drive for families of children with special needs. They focus on growing the gaming community. In the past, Darren has organized demo days to show off new games and run leagues for some games.  The location is about as good as it gets in the west valley. It's across the street from ASU West. And close enough to Central Phoenix that anyone in the west valley can get there easily and some people from the east valley can make the trip quickly enough.  If you like board games come in on Thursdays. The regulars are usually happy to teach new games to all players.

I'm not sure about everyone else. But I hate buying cars.  Last week our old, reliable 2004 Elantra basically died. It started making awful sounds, the AC quit (it is July in Phoenix), and was just not running great. We took it in to our favorite repair place and we were told over $1000 just to get it in decent shape but almost $4000 to really overhaul the thing. Basically 3-4 times the trade in value to repair a nearly 10 year old car? And my wife does home visits which means that she NEEDS a reliable car. And she needs it now.  So we did the dumbest thing imaginable. We went into a dealership when we were desperate. Thankfully, a few people recommended Avondale Toyota first. Because we may have been taken at certain dealerships due to needing a solution that night (wife already took that day off while car was getting looked at and a second day off in a row was going to start getting expensive).  When we got there, we started looking at the Prius's first. Someone came out to greet us and sent a sales person to come talk. My first thought was that I heard that the sales staff left customers alone until they had questions. So I was a bit worried, that maybe things have changed since our friends visited this place.  But the salesman was not pushy. He patiently walked through both new and used sections of the lot answering questions, finding us the lower end models of 3 different cars (Corolla, Camry, and Prius). He explained their philosophy, and told us what the actual price of a car would be if it did not have a tag hanging from inside. He let us know that that price was final, there was no negotiating.  In the end, we test drove a new Corolloa LEP (lowest end because we need efficient and reliable and not much else). There was no "actual price" sticker but he guessed it and was right. The price was right in the ballpark for "fair" prices for a new '14 Corolla in this area according to KBB (which I looked at before going so I at least had SOME idea)..  Next came the really frustrating part. Financing. We planned to replace our car next year. But due to the massive repairs happening now, we were not able to save for a down payment. Toyota is offering 1.9%/5 year financing on new cars (0% for a Camry) even with 0 down payment. He had to check our credit score and showed all 3 numbers (one common game is to just show the lowest of the 3 if it puts you below the threshold for the advertised interest rate).  We were doing a trade in. He did not take our Elantra keys hostage. In fact, he never even took them until we saw all of the numbers and offered us an initial estimate on our trade (which was higher than what I saw on KBB). This same person was with us every step of the way. No manager back and forth, no financing manager, nothing.  We were never pushed into more expensive warranties, services, upgrades, etc. The only thing he ever did was say that he generally recommends getting a service plan that is as long as the loan (normally it is 2 years for maintenance, 3 years for repairs, and 5 years for drive train). We declined because finances are tight now but will get better next year. He did not push for window tinting and said if we wanted to get it later, it would be the same cost then... no markup just because we waited. No pressuring for GAP. Anything.  My wife was still a bit nervous about the monthly price so he pumped up our trade in value another $400 (which brought it to 50% higher than what I saw for KBB with that mileage and year and in that condition).  At no point did I feel that this was a car salesman. It felt more like he was coaching us through the process. That we hired a consultant that was working for us rather than the other way around. Either Kris was great at his job or the philosophy of this dealership is working. No matter what, I strongly recommend this place to anyone. They MEAN it when they say no haggle. I have not been to the Toyota service department yet but do plan to update this review then (I've heard they can be slow but our salesman Kris said appointments help).

The food is great and the prices are reasonable. The portions are large so come hungry.  The food here is a bit more "home style". It isn't trying to be some fine dining experience and some dishes are pretty heavy. But the flavors are great and I walked out feeling like I was visiting an Italian family member rather than some stuffy restaurant. The beer selection is pretty nice. As weird as it sounded, the Moose Drool was great!  A bit of a warning. From what I've heard this place gets packed during the weekend. Be ready to wait if you plan to walk in on a Friday night.

Amazing tea selection. Great staff. Fair prices. And just a perfect hangout. If you want to go in and try a cup of tea they will brew you anything from the store (even the "gold tins"). If you buy at least 100g after tasting the tea, you get a discount. That darned deal worked well since we walked out with 100g of some high end black tea.  My wife loves the gingerbread blend and I'm a fan of the pumpkin. But there are plenty of great unflavored teas and all of the gear you could imagine to brew it.

Check in bonus of a tasty cookie. I'm not above accepting bribes!  This was my first (and hopefully not last) visit. Sandwiches were great. Prices seemed fair. And the system is great for grabbing office lunch. I was skeptical going in. But this place really does seem worth any higher prices compared to other sub shops.

Bevwhat? Okay I'm not going to insult them. But Total Wine seems to just be better in every way.  The selection is great. It does not matter if you want wine, beer, spirits, or other things (like cigars according to some friends).  The prices are nearly always the best in town. And it is not uncommon to find an online coupon to make things even cheaper.  Friday-Sunday they do free wine tastings and will offer discounts on any products in the tasting. On Saturday you can usually taste a few other products. In the past they've offered samples of tequila, rum, whiskey, or even introduced my wife to a brand of flavored vodkas that does not taste like alcoholic fake candy. The people conducting the tastings are always friendly, professional and friendly.  There are numerous events featuring beer, wine and spirits. Some are free, others are not.  The website, while not great, is competent and does allow you to play a pickup order. If you are like me and just want to be in and out (or don't want to be tempted to browse), place an order and it is usually ready within an hour. And the best part is I always get a new cardboard box. Drinks for friends and a free toy for the cat.

My first trip I would've given it a 3. The fish and chips were good but the batter kept falling off. But we went two more times and each time it was better.  There are plenty of types of fish to have. The drinks were fair and tasty. And the atmosphere is nice. A few more trips and I may change my review to a 5. I'm not sure if the place is just getting that much better. Or if our first visit was a bit of an off day.

This review is about the food at the diner, the samples of olive oil and vinegar, and the olive bar. During my trip with my wife and some friends that was what we tried.  The sandwiches were tasty. Naming them after olives can get confusing but just read the cheat sheet. the apps were great too. Eating a meal off of sandwiches and apps can get pretty pricey but it was a fun treat.  The aged balsamic was great. Just give me a straw! I'm not a fan of flavored oils so I avoided those. But some of the single source olive oils were making me want to throw together a salad right there.  And the reason that I would consider the 45 minutes - 1 hour to go back... the olive bar. Growing up I hated olives. About a year and a half ago I gave up soda and some things that I used to hate are turning into favorites. Good olives are on that list. The staff will happily walk you through some samples. And at $9/lb the olive bar is comparable to supermarkets. I ended up with a 1 pound container that had a mix of nicoise, kalamata, and my favorites... I believe they were Castelvetrano olives. They are large and very bright green. They are mild meaty and have almost no bitterness or strong briny flavor to them.

This park has one of my 2 favorite trails in Phoenix. The other is at South Mountain. I love the steep incline while walking towards the peak that looks over Arrowhead Lakes. I like how clean the park is.  My first trip up here was on Veteran's Day. It was a nice surprise to get to the top only to see a flag waiting up there.  Walking down can be a bit tough at times. But the way the trails connect, you can pick and choose your route far easier than some parks.  It is not as scenic as some places but is a great combination of interesting, offers a "modular hike", a nice workout, and the lakes are at least an interesting view for Phoenix.

The staff here is usually friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. I've seen a few things from some of the wait staff that made me think it COULD be rude (overhearing other tables) but I've never had an issue with my experiences.  The prices can get quite high but there are options for people on a budget.  The food: The Vogue Burger is one of the best burgers I've ever had at a restaurant. They will cook it to the rarity you ask so if you are a fan of a bit more pink, go for it. I'd avoid rare because it may fall apart on you. This is a big burger. The frito misto is a personal favorite. If you like a bit more heat ask for the chipotle aioli too. Don't expect to get tons of calamari with this side. But the combination of carrot, ginger, calamari, and aioli is usually one of my favorite parts of the menu. The lemonade is crack. Stop asking me if I want another! The wife loves the salmon appetizer. I usually steal her caper berries from it. I'm not a fan of lox but even I like it. We've tried the mac and cheese once and I could totally order that as an entree (and then probably spend the next 5 hours on a treadmill).  This is one of my favorite places in the west valley when it comes to just wanting to try new things. My and the wife can order a burger each and a frito misto and get out for a decent price. Or we can decide to just order a handful of apps and treat it like a tapas style meal. I've heard some mixed reviews for this place but I haven't had any issues after about 5-10 visits in the past couple of years.

When I want pizza in the valley, this is what I want. The pepperoni at Grimaldi's is amazing. And I'm normally not a fan of it. Why white pizzas are great. Combine the two and I'm going to need to haul my butt to the gym because I'm downing half a pizza.  They have a decent selection of beer and wine. Maybe not as good as some places but not bad. And the seasonal cheesecakes are great. Assuming that were are ordering less than 1 pizza for every other person, then I usually have room for the cheesecake and never regret it. If you do overdo it at dinner... just do some jumping jacks and pack it down!  The staff is friendly and I've only ever had 1 issue with anyone here. Also don't forget to sign up on their website for a free pizza on your birthday.

There was a time that I swore I'd never go back to Olive Garden again. There are many great and local Italian places in the valley. Olive Garden's prices were going up, their portions were huge, and the quality was either dropping or my tastes were maturing.  And then recently we went with some friends. I have to say that there was a time that I loved Olive Garden before getting to the point I mentioned before. Our last trip reminded me of the good times here. The salad was great. The breadsticks had more flavor than just butter and salt. And a better texture than my last few trips. And the pasta dishes were great. Suddenly this place is higher on my list than 1 or 2 of the local favorites I would've recommended  a year ago.

After years of going I guess I'm burned out. The festival basically is the exact same each year. If you've never been, it is worth the trip. Gone before? Maybe.  Highlights of the weekend: A chance to show off some of the cooler businesses in old town Glendale. Chocolate. Some guys that come each year with homemade root beer (worth it for them alone). OTG (one of the pubs) generally has at least 1 chocolate beer on tap. Great restaurants in downtown Glendale. Haus Murphy and Pizza al Forno are two of my favorites. Lenny's is okay if you want a burger, fries, and malt.  Downsides: Parking. All Glendale events have this issue. It's not awful, but not great. It is the exact same each year. Unless you are a real chocoholic I'd say it is worth going once or twice. But after a while it's got a bit of that "been there, done that" feel. I don't know what would help but this year we basically just did a loop around and had some root beer.  Go once. Go with friends or kids. Hit up some of the local businesses. But I'm not sure it is a year in and year out thing.

There was a point where I was considering giving up on Blu Burger. Apparently when they first opened, the place was quite upscale and pricey. My aunt told me that you could get some really high end burgers here but to expect to spend $20-30 per person.  If that is the case, we never went when it was like that. The current menu has been in place for a few years and I'm a fan of that. I will say that the American Kobe (which is a pet peeve. Kobe is from Kobe, Japan! The breed of cow is wagyu. I wish restaurants would call it wagyu!) was good but I didn't find it worth the increased price. The selection of toppings is great but some of the upgrades do cost extra. I personally wish caramelized didn't cost extra but that's not a huge deal. The fries and onion rings are both great. The sweet potato fries are not bad. For a while all of these sides were pretty bad. Everything tasted mushy. I have not tried the fried zucchini since the last time I ordered it. But that was back when I was thinking this place had gone downhill.  My last 2 visits were far better. I'm not a fan of the 50s decor but the food has gotten back to the point I remember when we first started going. My favorite burger is med rare. I like goat cheese, lettuce, caramelized onions, and whatever aioli strikes my fancy that day.

When I want a big bowl of comfort food and am in the east valley this is one of our favorites. The soups are great. And I don't have to do any work (I'm the cook in our house). Sometimes I just want a hearty bowl of pho or another Asian soup. And this place can kill that craving. And the prices are high but the portions are huge. I do think that some of the side dishes are a bit expensive for the portion size but the soups are great.

If I've got to have some fast food, I may as well get something I enjoy. Chipotle always seems to hit the spot without being a grease bomb. I've had some issues with using the order ahead on the site and coming to pickup (showing up at or after recommended time and they didn't even have the order in front of them) but they usually can still have me in and out in a few minutes.  I haven't tried too many of the other things but everything I have tried, I've liked. My drug of choice? Black beans, sour cream, lettuce and pico, hot, and corn salsas.

Glendale has 3 well stocked libraries. My wife always gets her fair share of audio books (she drives 1-3 hours per day to do home visits with young children). I've gone through the Alera series and am currently working on Wheel of Time. We've managed to even (eventually) borrow season 2 of Game of Thrones.  The area outside has several interesting hangouts. I just wish the little coffee shop would come back!

I buy my beans from a roaster who is a friend of a friend in Michigan. I've been looking for a local roaster for a while and Press Coffee ALMOST replaced my usual.  As a coffee shop this place deserves a 5. If you need a coffee fix then come here. As a roaster it was so close to replacing my go to place. If the selection were a bit better or the prices were a touch lower I would have made the switch.  Definitely worth visiting and if you want to take some beans home, you will not be disappointed.

In the past I'd say the other location is better. But overall I think both work just fine. The other location seems to have specials more often. But here you don't have to deal with that back parking lot like on Indian School.  If you are looking for great salsa, fair specials, a decent margarita, and pretty good food Popo's is always a good choice. The food is a bit heavier than some places but definitely better than xyzabertos.

This is my favorite yogurt place in the valley. The staff is friendly, especially our first visit a few months ago. The prices are fair. The yogurt is tasty and there is a good selections of addons. If you are next door looking for ice cream it may be worth stopping in to at least taste some of the yogurt.

My aunt raved about this family that used to cook amazing Mexican food out of their house years ago. After she heard that they opened a restaurant, we decided to go one night. The food was decent but the service was almost nonexistant. After being there for about an hour I managed to get 1 refill of my drink.  The fajitas were good but they only gave 2 small tortillas. I ended up eating most of it with just a fork. Didn't feel very fajita-ish to me.  The salsa was good but my family complained that even the mild was pretty hot. I like heat so I enjoyed it.

The good? Well it is better than Pete's.  When my mom was in town this Spring I decided to buy her dinner at Culver's after a few people recommended it. My aunt strongly recommended the seasonal walleye so I went for it.  First off this review is partially my fault. I'm an active Yelper. It is usually my fault when my expectations are off. I expected a casual sit down place like Denny's or Big Boys. So it is my fault for not doing my homework.  Second, it is less fast casual and more fast food. I got the impression from a few people that this was a fast casual place. But it felt more like McDonald's with a few seasonal specials to me.  Third. The food. My wife thought her friend chicken was okay. My walleye was better than Pete's and other fast food joints. But on par with decent fish and chips? No. And it cost more than my last trip to our favorite fish and chips joint.  The restaurant even looked messier than most McDonald's I've been to.  Next time, I'm going to remember to check before offering to treat family to dinner even if I have a recommendation. Because this place was disappointing and I would've rather spent the money to buy some fish, oil, beer, potatoes and make dinner for twice as many people for the same price.

Great selection of olive oils and vinegars. I always come to get my traditional balsamic vinegar, maybe some picual olive oil, and sometimes sesame seed oil. It is a fun place to come sample, buy some stuff, and talk to the owners. If you've never tried good olive oil give this place a whirl.  And before going crazy on the flavored vinegars, try the traditional balsamic. Just once. It is worth it!

Black Cat was a great rest stop during a long bike ride. The wife and I made the trip over to OHSO from Peoria and ended up coming to Black Cat after seeing the long lines. The shop made a good cappuccino and great sandwiches. The staff let us refill our water packs (sorry we cleaned out your water twice!) and we were on our way home. I can easily see this being a rest stop for my 50-80 mile rides when I'd rather have light bites instead of a heavy meal.

Amazing selection of beers on tap. Great happy hour specials. Good food. Friendly service. And a nice patio area during the months that we don't use the phrase "It will only be 105 degrees today".  You can get pitchers of on tap local brews for $6-11. The pitchers are plenty generous. The burgers are great. The fish and chips (which in my opinion is the best way to judge any brewery) taste great. It's always a good sign when they bring out malt vinegar without being asked. I prefer the texture of cod to mahi but the breading was tasty and it wasn't a pile of breading with a sliver of fish. The tartar sauce had great flavor and it looked made on site (I've never seen store bought with pickles diced that large).  The only real issue here is the parking. If you show up during busy times, it can be a nightmare. The valet helps. The guys out front are friendly and do not push hard for tips (which of course makes us want to tip them more than we would have had we felt pressured!). It can be a frustration but in the end it is worth it.

There are not many taps at OTG. But they get rotated frequently. The bartender is always friendly and just the right amount of helpful while letting the wife and I chat after working too often.  The selection of bottles is top notch for such a small pub. The run specials often and have plenty of events and even do fun things when downtown Glendale is running an event. They recently started serving app style food but I haven't tried anything yet.  If you want a nice casual hangout for a couple of friends after work, this is the place to go.

I know I'm in the minority here but I just didn't get it. The sushi was not bad but it was nothing to write home about. I didn't think the conveyer added anything to the experience. But I can see coming here if I worked nearby and had a sushi itch but not a lot of time for lunch.  If I could I'd go 2.5 stars but not quite a 3 for me. Not bad enough to say avoid at all costs. But just not somewhere I'd go back to except with friends if they wanted to go.

This place is how you define service. The guys here are great. They are helpful. They are not in your face, pushy, give you the feeling of trying to upsell you. The prices are high but they are selling good products.  If you want to try something new: hiking, running, minimalist running, different styles of sandals, etc. The staff here will answer your questions. The selection of specialty socks is great too. I wear 12W for most things so I can't really buy shoes from them. But I do grab a few pairs of socks per year here since I love smart wools. And I always shop here first, hoping they have the something that is right and fits well.  The only problem is many of the shoes here are made with Vibram rubber. Which means your shoes will last far longer. So you won't need to go back as often. But the smart wools!

Why does this place have to be so far away? The brats are amazing. The pretzels are the best I've ever had. And the beer cheese... one day I will learn how make something that tastes as good at home. And then have to start running weekly marathons.  The beer selection is great. There is plenty on tap and the prices are pretty reasonable. Where else can you get a German Oktoberfest on tap in March?  Pretty much everything is made on site. The pretzels, the brats, even the sauerkraut is made here and from local ingredients. If you end up sampling a lot, the price can get high fast but if you just come in for a brat it can be a reasonable lunch.

Morning Squeeze hosting a Yelp event and threw a nice party. Great breakfast joint. A bit spendy but it is more than a greesy spoon. I'll definitely want to try this spot again since the event had a buffet and sometimes those aren't the best way to show off your food. But what I did sample seemed interesting.

5 star decor. I imagine this place may be a bit of a nightmare during the weekend. Both the restaurant and the bar area look like a nice, casual hangout.  We showed up on a Tuesday when trying to find some place that would have Thai or Vietnamese food around 8pm. Easier said than done in the west valley this time during the week. It turned out to be a good thing.  Tapas Tuesday was an enjoyable experience. Wife wanted the bacon wrapped lychee. The lychee had a nice texture and... well... bacon. I wanted the Korean short ribs and was not disappointed at all.  I could totally see going back on a Tuesday and ordering 3 orders of that for dinner with a couple of friends :p  Portions vs prices were a bit off unless you came in for a special. The food is great but unless you are sticking with daily specials, it can get spendy. Also entrees do not come with any form of starch. No rice, noodles, etc.  That said the food was great and 3 tapas and 1 entree was plenty filling for 2 people.  As for the drinks. I ordered 1 martini. If you are a James Bond fan (aka vodka martini) you'll be fine. If I want a traditional one, I prefer gin. So I ordered something sweet (I think Blue Winter?). It was interesting, different from anything I've tried before, and not overpowering. That said I'm a big guy and 1 of them did give me a bit of some tipsy for a little bit. When the menu says that the drinks are strong, they are not kidding. Which is strange because it did not have any of that vodka bite to it. Martinis are $10 or $11 but one of the daily specials has them $3 off and we didn't look at the happy hour specials (we were on the restaurant side).  Overall, I'd definitely go back. Tuesday seems like a great day because the tapas were enjoyable and that's a good way to get some variety. If I want more of a main dish style or a big bowl of pho, though, I'd go somewhere else. Hangout, drinks, or tapas seem to be their speciality!

This is a great casual restaurant. The food tastes amazing. The prices are fair (and don't forget that check in bonus). The staff are always friendly. I've been a loyal fan of Golden Greek for years. And I may have found a new favorite gyro in the valley. If only they could have GG's puffy pitas!  The Greek fries are amazing. The reddish/pink dipping sauce is addictive. And the rice tastes great. I do kind of wish that the shwarma wraps had a sour pickle in them but that is probably just a personal preference.  I'd recommend this to anyone that wants casual Mediterranean food in the west valley.

The setup, location and offerings here look promising. I'm looking forward to making another trip in the future. I was here with my wife and some friends for a Yelp event so my experience was limited but promising. I'll definitely add more detail if/when we make it back to that side of town to try it again.

Let me just start by saying that when it comes to coffee I like great coffee, fresh, and simple. I generally brew my own in a french press and grind beans that I buy from roasters and drink it hot and black. So most coffee shops aren't usually my cup of tea... err coffee?  But this time I am comparing it to the giant. Assume that massive chain from Seattle is a 3 star. I'd consider this place to be a 4. If I want a blended coffee, this has to be one of the better options in the valley. Their blended options have 2 shots and more of a coffee punch than I've had in other places.   Also walking up to the counter, the service was reasonably fast even though they were swamped and the staff was friendly. If you're on the go or want something cold and caffeinated, this is probably the place I'd recommend.

The staff at this outlet was worth the trip. They patiently (and helpfully) helped my wife while she was looking at bib shorts and tri suits. There was a large selection and the prices were right. Pearl Izumi splits their gear into 3 tiers: Select, elite and pro. All with 3 different price points to accommodate most people. The women's section has plenty to choose from (you'd be surprised how hard it can be to find women specific kit for women cyclists). There are clearance racks and plenty of sales.

Is it just me or have the prices recently gone up? Either way the food year seems good and affordable to me.  If you are going for a combo, the prices can get pretty high. But for 2 people, we just split a regular fry and skip the drinks and it really isn't any different than other fast food places. The fries are good. The burgers actually taste like meat.  My only complaint with the free peanuts is it seems like the turnover on them must be pretty slow. I get quite a few rancid peanuts. But those are only a free snack while waiting for my burger.

I walked in during a Yelp event and this place... this place. The owners are very friendly and they know their stuff. The brownie was ridiculous. The next time I am in the east valley, I'm going to make time to stop in. This place was amazing.

Thank you for this one, Yelp! All you will see outside is a nondescript sign from the road that says "Sushi". Something that generic seems like the kind of place that you would want to avoid. Thankfully, Yelp to the rescue.  I found this place while looking for ideas for my wife's birthday. 4.5 stars, in Glendale, prices seem reasonable. Let's try it! Great call.  The portions are standard. Expect 8 pieces when you order your maki rolls.  Happy hour is all day. Want to scratch the sushi itch without dropping too much money. There are plenty of good rolls for $3-5. We went very hungry and planning to sample plenty. We ordered 6 orders of sushi (2 were not from happy hour specials) and a large sake and it came to $58 after tax/tip.  The atmosphere was perfect if you want a more casual environment for sushi. If you are awful at using those wooden instruments of torture (like me), sushi is finger food. It seems strange to feel like you should be dressed up to order food that you may eat with your fingers. The music was quiet enough to easily carry on a conversation and was not the stereotypical Japanese background music you'd expect to hear at many restaurants. My preferences are more classic rock/metal but at least it didn't feel like they were trying too hard with the music.  The staff was attentive, friendly, and not pushy. They greeted us at the door and offered us a seat immediately. Our waters were never empty. I asked to have the sake come with our first order and they waited. I've heard that they will bring fresh wasabi if you ask (we didn't think to) but they did at least let us exchange our low sodium soy sauce for the real stuff (if I'm going to have soy, I'll have the real stuff!).  Our orders:  Las Vegas Roll. Fried. Tasted good. Not too much cream cheese. Rainbow roll. Nice size cuts of fish on these. Spicy tuna roll. Strangely enough this was my least favorite (normally they are my favorite "basic" maki rolls and the ones I make when I'm doing homemade). The tuna was a touch cold (I realize that expecting fresh/never frozen fish is unreasonable in the valley but that really did feel like it needed a bit more time to come to room temperature). And I would've liked a tad more heat. Spicy garlic and salmon rolls. More of these please. I can't remember the name but the spicy scallop rolls (not happy hour special but they were $6.95). Again, more please. And casey roll. This was my personal favorite.  The spicy ones were a touch spicy to my wife who is a bit sensitive to heat but edible. The sauce that the casey rolls came with was good enough that I started dipping my other makis in that.  At the end they brought us the mochi ice cream (we were debating it but deciding to save that for our next trip). It was a nice touch. Have us leaving on a great note and after trying it, we KNOW we will order it again next time.  The fish didn't smell at all fishy. The food stacks up well against any other sushi I've had in the valley (and generally at a cheaper price as long as you stick to happy hour specials). The restaurant was very clean. And I watched the chef wash his hands numerous times. Obviously a clean kitchen and work environment is important to him. This may not be the absolute best sushi I've ever had. But it was darned good and the price was right. We will definitely be back.

In terms of fast food, Chipotle is one of my favorites. This location used to be "Moe's" which was much the same. Food was a bit heavier and greasier but burritos came with all you can eat salsa. Chipotle does not and their chips and salsa is rather expensive. So if you haven't been to this location in a while, you may be disappointed.  But overall the food is good and the staff here is friendly.

This was a Groupon find and I am glad we found it. First off, getting in was not easy. We ended up parking at the mall and walking.   The food was amazing. My wife is normally so-so with meat and cheese plates but even she enjoyed everything on that app. The pizza was among the best we've had in the valley. The deserts were generous though not huge.  Now for what really stood out. The service. Our waiter was the most helpful I've ever met in a restaurant. He gave us advice but was not just pushing the expensive items. He was always there when we wanted a refill or had a question but was never there when we just wanted to talk.  There was live music and the singer was good and fit the ambiance of the restaurant perfectly. Overall it was a prefer dinner out to relax and enjoy some great food. This was one of those times that Groupon put a place on our radar for the next time we are across town.

The food I felt was 3 star. The beer was 4 star. And the service I felt was 5 star. The staff was friendly even when we were there for a company Christmas party, we showed up late, and it was getting chilly so we asked them to adjust the fire in the patio area. There are other brewhouses I'd pick normally. But this was a pretty darned nice place.

This is among the best sushi I've had in Phoenix. We came in hungry and tried... about half the menu it felt like. All of the sushi was great. The purple rice was interesting and I liked the texture. The only dish I had that I thought was mediocre was the fried rice. But the sushi was good enough to overlook that 1 slight hiccup.  Downtown parking can, at times, be a problem. But it is worth the trip. We will be back in the next time we are downtown.

We were here for a Yelp even and I have to say that I was impressed. I know that the staff and management will be on their best behavior during these events (after all they are basically a form of marketing) but still. This was the best service I've had at any Yelp event. Including some fine dining establishments.  The district managers (former owners before they went corporate) really seem proud of their work and their locations. The staff knew their stuff and they do temp their meat rather than rely entirely on a timer (which means that it is possible to get something that is not as overdone as most fast food locations).  The food all tasted great and there is a huge variety including interesting looking salads. And don't forget about the hidden menu items including... friend pickles.  In my opinion, this is one of my favorite fast casual places in the valley. I'd place them above 5 Guys and In And Out. And the prices seemed a touch lower than 5 Guys and you can get something from 4 Peaks if you want a drink too.

We went with a groupon. The bartender was friendly, funny, and helped me pick out a great drink. If you like games, come here. I even saw a copy of Cards Against Humanity in the back. That game is perfect with a few drinks!  If you want a huge selection of beer and wine and some decent food, give it a try. I didn't see any taps but the selection of bottles is so huge that I was happy just trying something new.  The specials are very fair. And while the chalk and wall can be intimidating I did not find it that hard to browse.  It can get crowded and parking can be difficult. But it is worth it to visit this nice hangout.

The salsa bar was fun and interesting. Maybe not quite as tasty as I had hoped. But it was amusing to try so many different styles of salsa.  When people say get the horchatta, they mean it. Get that thing. Lots of flavor. Not too sweet. Overall very much worth the price.  The tacos were wonderful and this was the first time I had mole that I really liked it. So much deep flavor. Give this place a chance. It is not like the stereotypical heavy, greesy food that we've come to expect. But the flavors are amazing.

This is a fun, relatively new park that has been a welcome addition to myself and my wife. My wife works with children 0-3 and has often met families for outdoor time. We meet here at least twice per month as part of a cycling group. We even had a graduation party here. The park is clean, well lit, and has plenty of options. People looking to rent pavilions can get a fair price and there's no nonsense.

Cuff offers some interesting food in old town Glendale for a reasonable price. My wife ordered a burger that she pegged as the second (or third) best she's had in the valley. I had the brisket which had a nice little kick to it.  The meat and cheese plate felt a bit underwhelming. 1 cheese, a couple VERY thin slicers of a couple cured meats. Almonds. 3 pieces of bread. Mustard and some kind of preserve. We had to ask for the olives separately. That meat board is probably the main reason why I'm thinking 4 stars instead of 5.  Service was friendly but a tad slow. The bartender served us and he was friendly but when he had to tend bar, things got a bit slow. The restaurant is attempting to hire more staff so hopefully the speed will get better in time.  Restaurant has a nice decor and was clean. They have a full bar and the prices seemed reasonable. I would wish for a couple decent local brews on tap but I guess there are other options nearby for that.  Overall the West Valley could use more places like this and I'm looking forward to trying more food and hopefully they are able to get fully staffed in the future.

My wife and I have been cycling off and on for a bit over a year now. We took the plunge and bought new comfort bikes last fall and then temporarily upgraded to used fitness bikes this past spring.  We have been preparing to buy endurance road bikes and narrowed our selection down to 3 manufacturers. We ended up selecting another one but that is not a knock against this shop. There are plenty of reasons to buy from Giant and especially this shop:  Women cyclists: Look into Liv cycling. Liv works hard for women cycling. These are not pink it and shrink it bikes. They even have ambassadors across the country that try to help the female cycling community. Look for Cindy if you need help with fitting. But the entire staff knows their crap.  Disc breaks: Giant is moving all bikes towards disc breaks. If you want discs, chances are any bike you can buy from Giant 2015 and onward will have them.  Part swapping: If you want to change out parts on your bike, the shop will work with you. They offered to trade in the lower spoke count wheels for something higher since my weight is still too high for race wheels. They offered to swap saddles for my wife. They even looked into the price to upgrade an Ultegra bike to Ultegra Di2.  Remember my bit about Cindy? She organizes weekly rides over at Meetup. You can ride with her and probably get more questions answered.  The overall feeling of the store: Huge selection. Clearance models if you need to look for a deal. Friendly staff that is not pushy and wants to work with you. And Giant as a manufacturer offers some of the best bang for your buck. My decision to get a different bike has nothing to do with the shop and is all about small decisions based on the bike I eventually bought. In the end, location may have been a tiebreaker for me. Had I lived in Scottsdale, I probably would've ended up buying a Giant Defy Advanced Pro 1. And I'd highly suggest that to someone looking at an endurance bike with a full Shimano Ultegra groupset and disc breaks.  For men we can get Defy which is the endurance bike. It is good for long duration in the saddle and rougher roads. Propel which is an "aero" bike. And TCR which is lightweight. Defy goes from 1-5 it is an aluminum frame and the number mostly has to do with the gear shifting and breaking, lower is better. Advanced 1-3 are carbon fiber. Advanced Pro is basically Advanced 1 with a couple of upgrades. Advanced SLR is pro level and probably has electronic shifting. They have a good selection most models in various sizes. And those are road bikes in a shop that does a lot of work in mountain cycling. I have no idea how great their selection for mountain bikes is since that's not my area of interest.
