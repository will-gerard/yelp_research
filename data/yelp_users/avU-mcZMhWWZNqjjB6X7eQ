The staff is always polite and friendly and are quick to fix any problems you might have.  The portion sizes are great if you want to do family style dining, or get something just for yourself and have plenty left over for lunch the next day.  Not a place you want to go if you are looking for a quite night out, but otherwise the atmosphere is romantic enough to take a date to on a Friday night (just be sure to make reservations!) .  Personal favorites are Chang's Spicy Shrimp and the Banana Egg Rolls.

Been looking for a good Indian restaurant for awhile now, and it looks like I am going to have to keep on looking.  The staff was very unfriendly, not even saying welcome, or how are you today?     The food itself was okay, nothing worth going back for, but not something that I wanted to walk out over either.  The only real redeeming item was the Rice Pudding that my husband had for desert.   Overall not a place that I would tell people to go to.

A fun place to go with a group or a date!  Be sure to order something flaming cause that's a real treat.  The food is great, I love the gyro platter, and the gyro salad.  The portions are surprising, since if you get a large salad you would be amazed and their idea of "large".   The deserts are okay, but I haven't had many of them since by the time it comes around I am ready to be rolled out the door.

The prefect beginning to a romantic date.  The Compass Room is atop the The Hyatt Regency in downtown Phoenix.  The restaurant rotates and if you go during sunset will give you one of the most breath taking views of the valley.  You end up paying for the view though, as the prices on the menu are rather high.  The food is good quality but be prepared around 80-90 dollars for two people (salad, dinner and desert) as well as drinks.  Fun place to go for a special occasion.
