I really love the spacious suites at RI Hughes Center. The room rates were very reasonable - about $120/night during the week for a 1 bedroom suite with a kitchen and living room. The rooms were well cleaned each day and they had plenty of dishes, cups, ice, and utencils.   RI Hughes Center offers a delicious free dinner during the slower nights of the week (Tuesdays for sure) and has a delicious complimentary breakfast each morning. I'm not talking about a Continental breakfast that teases your taste buds - I mean a real scrambled eggs, waffle, toast, bagel, cereal, sausage, etc. breakfast.   The service at RI Hughes Center is impeccable. They were there for everything I needed. My room key kept getting demagnetized because I accidentally placed it next to my cell phone and the front desk was quick to fix the key. I also had forgotten my keyboard cover and they mailed it back to me after calling to make the request.  RI Hughes Center is within walking distance to the strip, but it isn't so close that you have to deal with traffic near the suites. The pool has a crazy amount of chlorine, but that's to be expected in the ultra-hot desert.  I'd recommend RI Hughes Center to families visiting Las Vegas.

I'm so glad that I visited Upstairs. The vibe is laid back, the service is friendly and helpeful, the food and beverages are reasonable priced, and the live jazz entertainment is terrific. The pianist that was playing the night I visited is an accomplished festival jazz player in the Northeast area.   I'd recommend that you visit Upstairs and enjoy a great night out in Montreal.

This place is pretty cool. I was craving a wrap and searched through downtown until I found Anton & James. The folks working at AJ were very helpful. I asked about many of the items on their menu and they took time to pleasantly explain the ingredients. I eventually ordered the Tuscan sandwich converted to a wrap. Very tasty.  The prices are decent and I like how  you have the option to take ready-made food to go or have it made fresh. AJ has plenty of good seats along the windows so that you can people watch along Rue Stanley.  The only downside is that it costs $6 to add chicken to their veggie wraps. That seems really excessive considering that you can buy a cooked rotisserie chicken from Costco for less than $6.   At any rate, I'd recommend AJ for good food, service, location, and prices.

Mister Steer has lots of seating and reasonable prices. The food is okay - I had a western omelette. However, the service is horrible. I waited for about 30-40 minutes for my order when folks around me were getting served. When they finally brought my order, it didn't have the side dish that I had asked for. The server was friendly, but clearly over her head even though the restaurant wasn't full and they had help.

Yummy, I loved Sunsational's iced coffee. The owner made the reasonably priced treat for me and included just the right amount of half n' half and sugar. Sunsational actually makes the coffee fresh for their iced coffee so it's just the right strength and ultra fresh. In addition to great coffee beverages, Sunsational has a wide selection of baked goodies, free wi-fi, and a laid back desert vibe. Head on over to Sunsational Coffee and you just might get a pleasant Surprise!
