From the second I walked into the office, I was greeted with smiles. I found Dr. Carr on yelp and decided to go to him after seeing all of the pleasant experiences. The whole staff is extremely nice, and professional. It turned out that I had to get my 3 of my wisdom teeth out. I was nervous because of an experience that I previously had at another dentist. But Dr. Carr made it very painless. I definitely recommend you coming to him for any of your dental needs!

I have been to cien agaves many times. Last night was extremely disappointing to me. My boyfriend pulled a long black hair out of his fajita, which, our waitress had her hair down, and had long black hair. We informed her about the hair, she said, I will be right back. Only to go see, that she put her hair up before speaking with her manager about it. He comes up to the table. Is completely rude to us. Asks us to show the hair after my boyfriend had flinged it to ground in disgust. Needless to say, after how rude they were about it, I will never be going again

This used to be my go to place. Unfortunately, times have changed. There are a very select few that do a good job, but the majority of them are lazy and rush you.    Today when I went, the girl who did my nails had to be physically woken up from a chair she was sleeping in. She came over, didn't say anything. I told her I didn't want them cut. Next thing I know one is cut super short. Then I told her to stop. But she insisted they be even and kept cutting. So now I have short stubby nails. Then comes the paint job. She gets it everywhere! I have her clean it up and there still are spots on the edges of my fingers. She doesn't bother to even file the ends of my nails. Next thing I know, she is getting up and moving to give someone a pedicure. I go up to the front and say I guess I need to pay, and they look at me like I'm crazy. They go over to the girl and I finally get to pay.   I have been a loyal customer here for over 4 years. I was able to look past a few things in the past, but today was the final straw. Unfortunately they have lost myself, as well as any of my girl friends that ask where to go.

If I could give them a zero, I would... Today I spent over 4 hours to try and make an appointment, and no one answered the 3 times I tried.. This is outrageous.... I went into the office also before needing to reschedule because they lost my paperwork..while on crutches, and they said.... Well maybe we might have time within 3 hours that they can squeeze me in... Like I'm going to sit for three hours in hours in hopes that I get "squeezed in" just terrible ... Never would recommend them

Amazing! My dog had repeated symptoms after a few months. All I had to do was call in for the meds to get them refilled and they didn't even make me bring her in, which would have been a waste of money. Love this place
