Although the golden medium wings are delicious, the service is probably the worst I have ever experienced. The servers stand around talking and don't even notice when a new table has sat down. Then no one checks on you. The service was truly an abomination. Totally bummed because really...the wings were tasty.

First off the street tacos are sooo good! Their carne asada is tasty and they have told me its a super secret marinade. Be sure to get the purple onions.  The place is family owned and everyone is kind and helpful. Thumbs up! The location is deceiving by the looks of the strip mall....do not be fooled its 5 stars!!!

This was such a pleasant experience. I had the special. It was a sandwich on 12 grain bread...uh yeah, its good...with turkey and chilies and strawberry cream cheese, lets see there were field greens and melted jack on there too. Nothing but a slice of heaven!  I asked for a recommend between the special and some other good sounding salad and the staff was friendly and smart about his tip. He said he tried the special, it was really good and not a lot of folks had ordered it. He recommended I get that since I could have the salad next time. Lucky thing it was great and yes, there will be a next time!

I have visited all of the east valley locations of Pita Jungle in my many years here in Tempe. I am super impressed with the management of this location. The staff is super friendly (which is typical of all the locations), they look hip (of course) but the best part is they are on top of it! I have not had to wait long here. There always seems to be enough employees, even when it is super busy.  The actual restaurant is artful and visually pleasing, full of fun and whimsy. The bikes on the ceiling are fun and the colorful wall above the kitchen are my favorites. There is a lot of room which is helpful since I have small children.   I enjoy the menu, which is consistent with all locations. The hummus cannot be beat anywhere. It truly is the best available I have ever had.  The kids meals are so nice. I love the options for the kiddos. It helps kids feel like they have a say in what they eat but all of the options are healthful. I don't have to lie and omit options from their choices. It's great! The most touching thing about this location is the management went above and beyond to consider the families with kids and had a small basket of toys the kids could pick from with their meal. It actually was a "happy meal" for all. Just such a treat.   Thank you for providing a wonderful dining experience!
