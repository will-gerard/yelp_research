I was skeptical about going to tanning salons at first because I always pictured pretentious, snobby people and it would take every ounce of my being not to snap on them the first second I sensed attitude, but Desert Escape is the exact opposite of that.  Friendly staff & moderately priced monthly packages are great. My only gripe is that there always seems to be something being maintenanced and the carelessness of sloppy customers lotion splatters on the walls that seem to go unnoticed. Other than that, I love this place and would recommend it to all.

I wish it was still one of West Phx best kept secrets, but anyone who knows better knows this is the beginning and the end of authentic mexican cuisine. I could hook their red sauce intravenously and be totally happy.  One gripe: Some of the hostesses are kind of young and inexperienced. I came in to order to-go once and instead of a normal greeting, she looked up and said "Wha happen?"  Dude... come on.

Ive been a customer here for almost a year now and I have never walked away unhappy. The staff are very accommodating and the atmosphere is edgy with the open, gossipy feel of old school beauty salons. No matter what I do to my hair within the days or weeks leading up to my appt (I get antsy when my roots start to show!) my girl Elsa always takes care of me properly and never forgets to remind me to use leave in conditioners to keep my hair healthy between visits.   One thing I like that Ive seen them do a hundred times is that they remind customers whats realistic and whats not. You can walk in there thinking you're going to go from jet black to bleach blond, but they advise you it will be a gradual transition instead of over-processing and ruining your hair. Ive had a horrible experience at another place because no one advised me that what I wanted done was unrealistic and my hair ended up falling out in chunks. I'm glad these women are educated enough to tell you whats up.   I'm giving a 4 out of 5 star rating ONLY because the decor of the salon itself needs a little sprucing up but that is my only complaint.   OH, and don't go in hungry. You can smell the fresh baked bread from the Subway next door... while intoxicating, never fails to make my stomach growl.

I've come here a million times for the pizza, which is awesome, but today I tried the baked ziti for the first time and it did not hold a candle to the pizza. There was something about the sauce that I personally did not like. Please take into consideration that I am a picky eater, so do not let this deter you from trying it yourself.  The soda is nice and crisp. You can tell they clean the machines routinely, which is also awesome.   There was also a woman behind the counter who I had never seen before. The two regular guys are nice, but this woman's constant smile and sunny disposition just makes your day automatically better. If you don't go for the food, go to see her and have a brighter day for doing so.

Literally writing this as I've waited 30 minutes for the waitress to come back so I can ask for my bill and get the hell out of here.  We were the first table here, accompanied by 2 other tables shortly after. Food took a little while, which doesn't bother me, but after the food was dropped off and the side of ranch came 5 minutes later (really?) The waitress was never seen again. I finally had to flag down the hostess to find her for me. What the deal was, I was too annoyed to ask, but I've realized this place is notorious for poor service. I used to love coming here, until they inserted the big bulky booths smack dab in the center of everything.    After today, I'm pretty sure my relationship with Native New Yorker just went from slim to non-existent.  As a waitress, I usually have sympathy and slightly more patience than most, but this place breaks all the customer service rules and THAT is a no no.

I could talk a blue streak about the terrible food and drinks, but other Yelpers already have and I don't like to beat a dead horse.   The service.... the service.  6pm on a Tuesday and it was wall to wall vacant. We were there for 2 hrs and saw the server maybe 2 times after our food came. We sat with cold plates and empty drinks for an hour. We kept seeing him somewhere near the kitchen, but could not flag him down for anything. There was a table behind us that sat, ordered and paid before we even saw our server again, and these ladies had an app, cocktails AND entrees. The margaritas were also 95% triple sec. I wanted to get happy at happy hour and this place did the opposite.

I have been in this store a handful of times and while the giant selection of products was outstanding, that staff was not.  Everytime I had a question about a product, I either couldnt find a sales associate or they were all too busy gossiping with each other to mind the customers.  I once wandered around the perfume aisles for a good 15 minutes before anyone even took notice.  I dread going there unless I absolutely cant find a certain product elsewhere.  Not recommended unless you feel like being ignored.

Go for the pleasant demeanor of Theodore and his eagerness to be of assistance to anything you could possibly need and also refusing your tip jar money (nice try, you get a fiver) and stay for the food anyway.  Free soup, fresh baklava and Theodore.   You're welcome.

Wow. I called this place three times, only to be hung up on the first two times. Driver did not follow instructions to not ring the doorbell, but to leave the food on the doorstep but found my note AND food missing, so I called the restaurant to only get attitude from the man answering the phone for him to hang up on me twice and accuse me of hanging up on him the second time. WOW. Also told me his driver tried calling me when he was outside... never happened. Not sure why I was lied to. Never had a problem with this place until tonight. Totally done with this establishment.  Clearly, I'm not the only one to that feels a one-star review is warranted. Get a clue, guys.

My little brunch crew and I have visited twice now and our experiences were insanely different.  First visit: -Sunday morning, few patrons. -Party of 8. -They organized the table and sat me so I could get a drink and some apps out before rest of my party arrived. -5 separate checks, no issues.  Second visit: -Sunday morning, few patrons.  -Party of 8.  -They told me I couldn't be sat til at least half of my party had arrived, so I had to wait 20 minutes with 3 of my friends til we decided to finally lie and say we were a party of 6 just to be sat and get some drinks. I get that's how some places do it, but it wasn't a packed house, so I don't get why that had to be an issue.  -Drinks were slow to come out because the bar was "backed up." Again, the place was deserted, so that was a little off to us. But, the second round was free due to the slow first round, so that was very nice of them.  -Steak and eggs were overcooked. Rare and under-easy? Nope.  -We ordered a vanilla brioche for a friends birthday, only to be told they don't have it, even though its on the menu. Not that they were out of it, but they just didn't have it.  -5 separate checks were needed, but we got 3 because she said that's all the computer would let her do. We know this not to be true, as that was not the case a month ago. I don't know what the strategy was, but she didn't pair up person to person, so everyones check had someone elses food/drink on it. She also gave us our checks before we were ready to leave. Don't do that. You didn't need that table because there was any sort of wait.   We came for the cheap mimosas and all we got was a reason to find a new place to brunch.

Little pricey, but totally worth it.   I received a menu on my doorstep 3 weeks ago advertising "natural" pizza. Thinking it was just going to be soylent green hippie crap, I didn't think anything of it until the mood struck me one day to order online. I was sick of being reminded on my calorie counter how completely horrible a single slice of other chain pizzas could be, so I thought I'd give it a shot.   I'm never ordering from anywhere else again.   Despite the sauce being a teensy bit bland (what could you really expect after they take away the chemicals?) this was seriously really, really great. To top it all off, they serve Jones Cream Soda. JONES. CREAM. SODA. I'm a fan forever.

This place is pretty much only good if you're half in the bag and desire greasy food down your gullet.  Ive tried several different menu items hoping that the next would be better than the last aaaand I was sadly mistaken.  The calzone was giant and greasy, the pizza needed to be dabbed with several napkins, the wings were dry and it was like chewing on rawhide... you cant really win with this place.  Furthermore, I'm a night owl that works late hours, so when I want something that isn't a drive-thru burger, I'll call for a pick-up order. The last time I did this (around 1am-ish and the place was packed),  I approached the counter to see 4 people standing there... one was on the business phone, the other three were texting.  Nobody even looked up to acknowledge me.  Not a single one. Really, guys??  Its called customer service. Try it sometime.    Yup. I think I'll have to stick with drive-thrus from here on out.

I've been here twice and I really don't know what to do with this place.  The food and service is great, but one time I came in for lunch, the chef was yelling at the staff about an order that it turns out HE screwed up (I was within earshot). Also, shouldn't a chef be behind the line instead of just lining up orders to go out on the floor?   Second visit, I was at the bar for happy hour waiting for a few friends. There were some gentleman next to me that seemed to hone in on a very inebriated woman and again, within earshot, I heard one ask if shes ever tried GHB and "that its amazing, if she wanted to try it with them." Hi. Thats the date rape drug. I flagged down a server to grab a manager to intervene on this poor woman and 5 minutes later she comes back and says the manager said those guys "spend a lot of money here." Thats it. Nothing else was done whatsoever because those men have money. Thats disgusting. Shame on management for caring more about money spent than guest safety and satisfaction.

I used to come here a lot when I lived in the area because I clearly didn't know any better. Half of the time when I had a minor problem, everything was fine and work was quick and easy. When it was something more than an oil change, it was a disaster. The last time I went, which I made the absolute LAST time, they couldn't figure out why my fan wasn't kicking on and literally told me it would take NASA to figure it out. Real professional, guys. Which is hilarious, because I took it elsewhere 2 days later and it was fixed in 4 days, only because the part had to be shipped from overseas. I also recall a time where one of their grease monkeys walked me under my car and pointed out something to do with my brakes, so I scheduled an appt to handle whatever it was he was talking about and was told there was absolutely nothing wrong and they didn't know what I was referring to.  I could never decide if they were just lazy, uneducated in their craft or thought I was an easy target because I'm a woman, but this place is a joke.  The employees also use their only loaner car as a personal everyday driver. Proof of this was the amount of paperwork and briefcases left in the backseat, and when I brought it to their attention that the previous customer might have left personal belongings behind, one of the guys just chuckled and said it was his stuff. Very unprofessional.

I Yelp'd a new auto repair shop after I ripped apart the last one, and I found these guys.  First off, they have a woman in the office, which made me feel better right off the bat. I've never seen a woman working at any repair shop that wasn't male dominated that I didn't feel totally snowed when I left, so this was nice.  I needed an estimate on repairs to pass emissions, as well as an overall estimate for everything else I need done in the future (brakes, oil change, etc.) I left my car there and didn't hear back for over 6 hours. I thought that this was really good because they were taking their time and not rushing themselves, or this was really bad because it was more serious than I thought and maaaybe they just threw their hands up at my devilmobile and took a long lunch to clear their heads. The former seemed right. They called me and gave me the rundown about my emissions and while I wasn't planning to get anything done today, they quoted me an extremely reasonable price when I was expecting to pay triple. I told them to take care of it when they have the time since it was already there, again, expecting to get it back sometime tomorrow since it was already mid-afternoon.  Again, they called me a quarter to 6 and said it was ready.  I went to go pick up my car and waited approx. zero seconds to have the keys handed back and... SURPRISE... they took my car to the emissions testing station for me so I wouldn't have to. If that's not customer service, then i don't know what is. They also have a customer loyalty card (that I am going to use the HELL out of), 2% cash back (or something like it) on services and rewards offers for all referrals.   Keep up the fabulous service, fellas. Every business should model their ethics after yours.

Love love love this place. Its the cleanest, quickest tanning salon I've ever been to. 9 times out of 10, I walk in and literally keep walking to the room Christine tells me is open. No stopping. Thats it. Also, she is the sweetest thing in the world. She always asks me how my session was even though I razz her for it.  They used to have a can of spray deodorant in the booths to freshen up after a session. Maybe do that again? That was an unique touch since I've never seen that before at other salons and no one really wants to face the rest of their day smelling like sweat and lotion.
