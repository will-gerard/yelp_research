As a former Starbucks manager, I hold Starbucks stores to extemely high standards. I frequent SBUX a lot. By a lot, I mean more than the average Starbucks freak. With that said my input is based on what I know the founder of Starbucks wanted out of each store, and how close the store is to achieving that level of quality service. If any of the points below has an "N/A" next to it, that simply means I was not able to form an opinion based on our interactions.  1-Below Standards 2-Meets Standards 3-Outperforms Standards  Store Review  Now that I live in the North valley, this is my regular Starbucks store and I feel very fortunate to have such a great Starbucks in my neighborhood.   Avg Visits: 4-5 times/week Partner Friendliness: 3 Partners smiles, cheery, strike up conversations Partner Appearance: 3 Always look professional (some are well decorated!) Partner Knowledge: 3 They knew my drink, know coffee well, and since they know I'm a former barista, they love talking back and forth about coffee in a way only Starbucks nerds would talk.   Store Appearance (decor): 2 Standard Starbucks cookie cutter appearance that Starbucks so desperately does not want. Store Cleansliness: 3 This store is always very clean.  Store Comfort: 3 Comfortable setting and furniture for doing work for long periods of time.   *Either 1 or 2 for this section. Its either right or wrong* Beverage Taste: 2 Iced Single Venty Hazelnut Breve Iced Coffee, Dirty Chai, or Triple Espresso Beverage Consistency: 2 Never had funny tasting drinks Beverage Temperature: 2 Always ice cold or steamy hot. Beverage Preparation (I watch): 2 No health hazards, shortcuts, etc. Beverage Mistakes: 2 Never had a wrong drink made but watch out for customers that accidentally steal your drink!   Will I return?: YES  I personally don't care for Starbucks food and do not believe that is what Starbucks is about. Therefore I do not review their food offerings.

I am a regular at this place and there are few places I can say that about. The food is excellent, authentic, and inexpensive. The waiters and waitresses may put you off at first by their casual appearance but it sets the comfortable atmosphere of this place. Inside is a little cramped but step out to the patio and you you can eat at the shore of a beautiful lake. The ducks are fun at first but as a regular, they can get annoying. Fortunately Pita Jungle has taken measures to stop them from visiting your meal. There Hummus is incredible and I also recommend their beef gyro and pesto pizza.

As a former Starbucks shift manager, I hold Starbucks stores to extemely high standards. I frequent SBUX a lot. By a lot, I mean more than the average Starbucks freak. With that said my input is based on what I know the founder of Starbucks wanted out of each store, and how close the store is to achieving that level of quality service. If any of the points below has an "N/A" next to it, that simply means I was not able to form an opinion based on our interactions.  1-Below Standards 2-Meets Standards 3-Outperforms Standards  Store Review  Let me preface this with two things. First, this store is not perfect whatsoever. However, this store is the busiest store in the state of Arizona in terms of revenues so in light of that, I'm cutting them some slack with the 5 stars. Second- The clientel that this store deals with is sometimes less than pleasant and they do a fantastic job at turning around bad situations. So lets begin!   Avg Visits: twice/week Partner Friendliness: 2 Partners smile, cheery, initiated conversation, although there are a few bad apples  Partner Appearance: 3 All looked professional without exception Partner Knowledge: This crew is very experience and knows coffee and Starbucks well  Store Appearance (decor): 1 Could use some work Store Cleansliness: 3 despite being the busiest store, it is always clean from my experience Store Comfort:1 This is by far my biggest complaint. I used to frequent this store every day for lunch when I worked in this area. 3 out of 5 times, I could never get a seat and during Arizona's summer's, there was no chance I would sit outside. I often either had to give up finding a seat or wait 15-20 minutes to get a seat.   *Either 1 or 2 for this section.

As a sales person myself, I was wary about my quest with my fiancée to buy a couch for our new apartment but finally decided to start looking. I am very opposed to IKEA for many reasons and did not even consider going there which left me wondering where people go to buy furniture in Arizona. After checking Yelp, I decided to check three different places; The Room Store, Mor, and Wholesale Furniture.   My first stop was Mor in Paradise Valley. I was surprised at the size of the store and the quality of the selections. Even more surprising was the extremely low pricing compared to what I had seen in my research online. Then the real surprises started happening.   Furniture sales people have the same reputation as car salesmen in my eyes. The only difference is less money at stake. As we walked into the store, I saw one of the salesmen mobilize and heading right at us. I instantly put on my defensive/offensive sales jacket to combat this guy's sales pitches. However, this elderly gentleman simply approached us asking if he could help us with anything in which my fiancée told him we were looking for a couch. Stephen (our sales rep) took that opportunity to simply explain how Mor's pricing works since we were first time visitors, and then let us know to ask if we need help. I was shocked. That was it? No let me sign your life away to our high interest credit cards? No up selling me into spending three times what I originally planned?   We walked around checking out every couch in the store but we fairly set on the very first couch we tried. After joking with each other about how we had just become the easiest sale ever, we approached Stephen to buy the couch.   Stephen, who I later found out is also the GM, was a witty, knowledgeable, and had a great sense of humor. He made me feel like I could trust him (a big deal as someone who also works in sales). I was then waiting for all of the pitches on extended warranties, services, and everything else that I would think shouldn't be necessary if the furniture was of good quality. The only thing Stephen asked (not pitched) was whether we wanted damage protection which we opted out of. When we said "No Thanks" he said "No Problem". Easy. We wanted to have the couch delivered since we live on the third floor and would not be able to lift this big couch alone. He asked us when we wanted it and my finance jokingly said "Right now?". His response? "How about between 7pm and 9pm tonight? I was floored. Same day delivery? For no extra costs besides the delivery fee? Keep in mind, this was 5PM when we purchased the couch. We jumped on the offer.   Later that night, we got a phone call from the delivery driver stating he would be there in 30 minutes. He then called a few minutes later apologizing that he was running late and would be there in an hour. I was impressed that he would call to update me on his ETA.   Once they arrived, they carried the big couch up the three flights of stairs, dropped it off in our living room, removed all the packaging, and drilled the legs into the bottom for us. When they left, the couch was ready for us to plop down and enjoy our movie for the night.   I highly recommend Mor and will always be going back to them in the future for all of our furniture needs. Thanks Stephen!
