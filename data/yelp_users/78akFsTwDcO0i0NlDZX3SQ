I dig Cheesecake Factory. I've been here a bunch of times and never had a bad meal there. My last visit was for lunch with my friend and her 3 year old daughter. As soon as we were seated our server brought us bread and fruit for the kiddo. Portions are ginormous -- we had the Asian Chicken Salad and the fish tacos and went home with a full bellies and doggie bags.  The cheesecake rocks - I recommend the chocolate chip cookie dough. Yum!

If you're looking for a vet you can trust, I'd definitely call Dr. Stacey Ryan. She's been taking care of my dog Mikki since I moved here a year ago. Dr. Ryan is caring, compassionate and very knowledgable. When Mikki was sick this past summer I brought her to see Dr. Ryan and a few days later Dr. Ryan called to follow up on how Mikki was feeling. If you take your pet to Blue Cross you'll be in good hands. The staff is really great too.

WOW! This place is cool. Furniture Affair is a model home furniture resale shop. They've got everything from furniture and art to lamps and accessories -- and all at really reasonable prices. The get new shipments in regularly and I was told their stuff sells fairly quickly.  One catch -- no returns or refunds.

Pasta Brioni was one of the first restaurants I tried out when I moved to the valley last year.  The bruschetta appetizer is a favorite and I've never been disappointed in the spaghetti and meatballs. My only gripe is that they don't offer Chicken Vesuvio, which happens to be one of my most favorite Italian dishes. I'd probably visit more frequently if they did. The service is really great. The waiters -- yeah, they're pretty cute -- are friendly, attentive and accomodating. Two thumbs up for Pasta Brioni!

Diagnosis: Delicious!!   I've heard this place was really good but I was still suprised with how great the grub is. I recommend the secret bbq chicken sandwich. The thyme fries are killer and the fruit salad was yummy too.  Prices were reasonable. Cool vibe. Can't wait to go back and try something else!

I'm obsessed with Oregano's. I've had their pizza a bunch of times but on my recent visit I had the Oregano's Favorite Salad which has sundried tomatoes, feta, roasted red peppers, pine nuts and red onions in it. LOVE it.  The Bistro Classic pizza is my favorite -- it's a white pizza with tomatoes, basil, and four cheeses on a super thin crust. YUM. I had to finish my meal off with the much talked about pizza cookie. It was RIDICULOUS. Don't leave without trying it. Trust me.

I can't believe I waited this long to swing by Fez. I went here last night and am hooked. I started with a pomegranatini and the garlicky hummus. Five stars for both. I had the strawberry/blueberry cashew salad. Again, five stars! Of course I had to finish my meal off with the warm chocolate nut brownie with vanilla ice cream. Another five stars for Fez. We sat at the bar -- I think our bartender's name was David -- the service was great.  Good times!

I've been wanting to try Chelsea's Kitchen for months now and finally made my way over there last night. Wow. I officially became a member of the clean plate club. I had the vegetarian nut burger -- delish!  I had the key lime pie for dessert and I'd definitley have it again. Our server, Christina, was super friendly and helpful when we were trying to decide what to order. We were there early evening so it was a little quiet but the restaurant has a warm, homey vibe. Looking forward to going back soon.

No one seems to like this place and now I know why. Maybe I'm giving it 2 stars because I'm a fan of their sangria. The chicken tacos are standard. My sis had the chicken skewers appetizer and said they were pretty dry.  I was there for happy hour on a Friday night and it was pretty quiet. Our bartender was nice but not super friendly. Um, I think that was my last visit to Pink Taco.

This is a really cool place to hang. Went here last night and had the roast beef sandwich with carmelized vidalia onions. YUM. My friend loved the grilled cheese and homemade tomato soup. If I Iiked beer I'm sure I would have been impressed with the beer list -- it's pretty extensive. They had nice choices of wine as well. Funny thing though, the only have root beer, ginger ale and bottled water. I was hoping for a diet coke but that's okay, after all it is a bar. Cool vibe, good service, great music. I'll be back...

I wanted something light when I went here with friends recently so I ordered the fruit plate. This fruit plate was GINORMOUS -- nice!  It seriously lasted me for a few days. Besides giving a thumbs up on the portions of my meal, our server was really friendly. Next time I go I'm definitely gonna go for protein pancakes.

My first experience at Pita Jungle was mediocre but my friends were raving about it. I just didn't get it. I had a veggie burger that wasn't too exciting. On the next few trips though I changed my mind. Try the hummus starter -- it's the best in all the land. You can't go wrong with a wrap or pita. I usually eat tackle the one thousand beans pita, which is a huge portion and you'll definitely have left overs.  Pita Jungle is always packed. Good, friendly service. Great for take out.

Two thumbs up for Jeff at A 1! I called him this morning and he was at my service by early afternoon. Jeff was very knowledgable and friendly. Good prices too!

Pharmacy service sucks. Takes FORVER to get your meds. The staff seems really unorganized. Not writing anymore. They took too much of my time up already.

Ashley Scott ROCKS.  I found her on yelp (thanks Gabi!) early this year and I've been bragging about her to everyone I meet ever since. I mean, seriously, this girl has a gift.  Other stylists have given me a color too light or too dark and funky haircuts with styles that I couldn't duplicate on my own. Ashley, however, gives me exactly what I was looking for everytime I see her.  Salon Ami is really cute.  Ashley is sweet, fun to talk to, always on time and the prices are right. I highly recommend!!

It seems like everyone had a better experience here than me. Maybe I just went on a bad day.  My biggest gripe about this place is that the veggies didn't look good. I had to pick through the carrots and tomatoes to find ones that looked relatively fresh. The sweet and sour sauce was kind of bland. Service was good though. Our server was friendly and checked on us regularly. Maybe I'll have better luck next time.

Now this is what I'm talking about.  I've been waiting for JA to open since I used to frequent the one back in IL when I lived there. My girlfriends and I had lunch there today. Not only was the meal delicious but the service was off the hook -- thanks Luke!  The ladies and I were all jonesin' for the rotisserie chicken. Loved it. I substituted the mashed potatoes for the vine ripened tomatoes. Yum!  And get this -- I wanted some of their skinny french fries and jokingly (well, sort of) asked Luke to snag a few for me from the kitchen.  After a couple of minutes he showed up with a plate of fries for all of us to share!!  And, not that I wasn't full already, we shared the white chocolate cheesecake with raspberry sauce for dessert. Incredible.  Five stars all the way for J. Alexanders. Looking forward to heading back soon.

OK, Sushi Roku has, in my opinon the best sushi in the Valley. It was ridiculous. Loved it. I went for happy hour and it was pretty quiet but I wasn't expecting it to be bumpin'. As a matter of fact I was hoping to avoid the snobs and I guess I did. (I hear they show up after 9 pm, FYI). I sat at the bar, enjoyed the edamame hummus and the spicy tuna rolls. The spicy tuna rolls were seriously the best. The service rocked too. Our bartender took great care of us. I'll be back.

Yay! Karve Studio finally made it to Scottsdale and I was there for opening day! It's a great workout that is basically a combination of ballet barre work, core conditioning and stretching. It's a one hour class that is challenging and a lot of fun. I totally dig the music -- I usually snag a song or two at the end of class to add to my ipod playlist. :)  Also, the Scottsdale studio will have a kids room and a locker room and showers. Total perk!  Can't wait to go back...
