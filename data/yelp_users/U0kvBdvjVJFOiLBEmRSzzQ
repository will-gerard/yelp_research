I had heard that this was a good fancy restaurant to go to so I took my parents here when they came to visit town and I must say that I was dissappointed. The cost for 3 people was exorbitant for the quality. We are not a family that minds spending a little for excellent food but this meal did not meet the standard for the amount our meal was for three people.  The portions of the appetizers we shared were tiny. I think we had three pieces of ravioli in the ravioli dish which was not much. My steak left a pile of inedible gristle that filled a quarter of my plate and I don't even usually mind a little fat which adds flavour.  It was clearly not edible but the waiter asked me 'aren't you going g to eat that?' 'Uh..that's a no.' For the price I would not go there again. Too expensive for mid level quality. I would prefer somewhere like the keg where I have had far better food at a better value.

This review is about my second experience at Tottie's. Our waitress was super nice and cute. She was also helpful and when she didn't know the answer to a question we had she went and found out the answer very quickly and didn't try to just make up some nonsensical answer to appease us which I appreciated.  I had the Pad Kra Pao with beef with level 7 Thai hot which is the top level of crazy there (no biggie). The basil on top was all in a big bunch that I had to off the leaves myself which I didn't love having to do but I think was part of their presentation with a big cabbage leaf underneath as well so it was not a huge deal. I enjoyed my meal much and liked the heat. It was a good mix of veggies and I especially like the red peppers and bamboo shoots in there. The waitress didn't check on us till near the end of the meal and I generally like them to see how we like everything a few minutes after we get our food so that's where the service surfaced. She was willing to bring all the Tice we wanted to with our food free of charge and gave a bunch more extra rice in the boxed up food she gave to the people I came with who did not finish their meals.   Overall really good meal and I'll most likely be back sometime relatively soon.

As you wish is so much fun! I've been here a few times to paint and it's a good chance to be creative. I always spend a lot more time here than I mean to. Feels like I've just starting painting and next thing I know I've been here for 3 hours.  There's lot of different kinds of pottery to paint and canvas and glass works that you can do as well. I've made food things here for my kitchen which are fun and a few other decorations to have around my house. I like being able to show people something I did when they are at my house.

I had, possibly, the longest wait ever at a Chipolt. Of all time. However, every bite was so good! They had the red peppers in the roasted veggies instead of green which made it sweet. Excellent heat level and really great smokiness. My faith in Chipolt is renewed. #blessed

I'm crazy for Mika's Greek. So far i have had the Caesar and the  diablo Caesar pitas. They are both so yummy. The pita bread always tastes so fresh with  grilled chicken that is seasoned just so.  For sides i have had the rice and also paid a bit more for the Greek fries which are topped with chunks of feta and drizzled with a vinaigrette (which they put on the side for to orders so they don't get soggy in the bag- smart). They are so tasty and different then #BasicBitchFries. I've been telling all my friends to go for awhile now so needed to write a review to tell the Yelpians to go!

Matt was great. When I initially called about my power problem he told me it might be something that the electric company could fix. I appreciated this very much because if it was something they would have fixed it would have been free. While another person I called told me it would be close to 200 hundred dollars just for them to come out and they did not tell me about the possibility of the power company fixing it. So, this same night I had someone from the electric company come out and found out it was something they did not cover so I called Matt back and he agreed to fit me in the next morning before I went to work.   Matt came ahead of schedule which I appreciated because he knew I was working later and would not be home. He investigated and determined what the issue was and how to fix it. He gave me my options and let me figure out what I wanted to do. He said he would have came back that day but I decided the next morning would work better so I could be at my job on time. He came the next morning bright and early as I requested and fixed my electricity up lickity split.   The main reason I would recommend Apollo is because Matt was honest which is the number one quality for someone working on your home.  He was also timely and efficient. I would definitely use Apollo again if I need an electrician.

Stuffrageous is so delicious! OMG! It is probably my favorite casual burger place. The workers all seem generally helpful and want you to enjoy your meal. Stuffrageous offers the yummiest stuffed burgers around with about 10 preset options such as the Mac n Cheese which has mac n cheese, jalape√±os, and bacon stuffed into the patty. All the burgers can also be made with chicken.  There is also the stuff your own burger option to make something exactly suited to your tastes which is what I usually do now that I have tried many of the menu options. I prefer my burger with Swiss cheese, bacon, and mushrooms on the brioche bun. They also have a few bun options. I also get the outrageous sauce,  which is kinda like a spicy mayo, on my burger.  All the burgers are served with lettuce, pickle, tomato, and onion (but I don't prefer the last two so I skip them).  The fries are definitely some of the top fries around.  They are battered, seasoned and always hot and served with a side of their outrageous sauce which brings me to my last main point about what makes Stuffrageous great. The food is ALWAYS made fresh to order and is hot when you get it.    TLDR: The food is yummy, made to order, with lots of options for customizing to your tastes and good service.

I just needed to do a quick update to my review because in my first review I did not mention the excellent price point. The cost is more than reasonable and i would pay significantly more for a comparable meal at lots of burger places.    Also on my most recent visit they remembered my exact order that I wanted which made me feel pretty special.
