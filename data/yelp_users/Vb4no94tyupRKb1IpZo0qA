Well shame on me for not looking at Yelp before I rented a limo for my family. Clearly their horrible customer service is widespread. The limo over heated, no a/c on a hot AZ day and then the owner tried to sneak in an extra hour charge the next morning. When I talked to him about it, he called me a b*tch.  Horrible owner, horrible company go to any other limo company.

Marcos, Nacho, Martin, Chris, David and Frank were the awesome crew that helped my family of 6 move this past weekend.  They were beyond fabulous.  They were so nice, professional, efficient...they did not make one mark in either house and they took the stress of moving away.  They were nice to our kids, extremely well organized and took excellent care of the 2 truckloads of furniture we had.  We are so grateful to them and we highly recommend them to anyone with moving needs.
