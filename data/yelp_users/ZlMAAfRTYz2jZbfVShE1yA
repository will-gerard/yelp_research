I am Rating by quality of the pizza. I came in just for a soda and decided to try the pizza. I sat in the cafe area and not the bar. The guys were really nice when they did make it over but i was left alone a bit. The bar, obviously the main focus. Im sure there was better service at the bar.  The Pizza.   I, like every one, love pizza and eat it a lot. But i don't like cheaply made commercial crap pizza. If you like Taco bell, Berger king, Dominos, Pizza hut and other low grade food thats fine. There is a time and place for that. When i eat pizza i want a nicely risen crispy crust, an appropriate to conservative amount of sauce and quality cheese.    What i received was loose doughy crust, not crispy. I don't know if it was pre bought, pre made or frozen. It was wet with tons of over sweetened sauce and had a little cheese. The cheese swimming in sauce. I really wanted to like this pizza because the guys were so nice but i left sincerely believing i had just tried the worst pizza i have ever had in Phoenix. Wait it was the worst pizza I've had anywhere. I was only able to eat one slice of a small personal pizza. I think the closest i could compare the pizza to was time a friend took me to hungry howies.     I am posting this for the pizza connoisseurs. If you are going for the bar it looks like they were doing a great job.

So many times i have been driving to or from the lake and had a discussion with someone about how good we have heard the burgers were at wild horse west. Last year a friend and i stopped in to try it out. This place is a bait shop and bar. Dirty boot cheap beer dive bar. You can sit at the bar or on picnic tables inside possibly next to other patrons. cash only. Chips only, no frys. BUT the bugger is awesome. Thick greasy patty, melted cheese over mushrooms and thick crispy bacon (my way). One bite then you know why you came. I dont care for bars at all so this is what we do. Call ahead and be a bit patient it is a loud crowded bar sometimes. leave the family or friends with the boat and truck outside and grab every thing to go. Then its only a few minutes away from the lake. Now you can enjoy your awesomeness at the shore or on the water.It solves the problem of whats for dinner at the lake while setting up camp the first night. cheap regular hot dogs for the tikes.  No more storys of good burgers.Now its time to eat good burgers.

Mr Cheese In respects to your cupid shuffle. You should be dancing with the perspective of the children. When the song says move to the left and you move to your left, in the eyes of the children you are moving to their right. Very confusing for a kid.Think about it from an audience perspective. I know its going to be hard to get, being a Rat. But when you say move to you left you are actually going to need to move to your right. Dancing Dad.
