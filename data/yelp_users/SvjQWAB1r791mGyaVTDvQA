I really enjoyed this place. You get some great Thai food with fresh ingredients for a great price. One of the ladies that runs the place was very friendly. Her personality made the meal all the more enjoyable. I'll be coming back.

Top notch doctors and super friendly staff. I have been seeing Dr. Christianson here for two years and my life has been better for it. He was able to find things that have been adversely affecting my health for years and had long been under the radar of conventional medicine. I go in once a week for a nutritional IV and feel so much better each time I do it.   I took an 80 foot fall in January. I was very fortunate to have survived it and now I'm using this place to get back on my feet again. I've been going in for electric acupuncture which has been helping me regain some sensation from what was once my paralyzed lower right leg.  I'm looking forward to the next time I walk through their door. I know I'll be greeted with a warm smile and sincere interest in how I've been.

I feel like I'm home here. Perhaps it's because it was once a home. This big beautiful bungalow is owned/managed by some of the most sincere and friendly folks I've met in the valley. This shop is so cozy.  The whole place has unique and inviting ambiance. The furniture is unique and comfortable. If it's nice outside there's a beautiful courtyard with comfortable outdoor seating for relaxing.  Awesome little place, I'm a regular now!

Kyoto is now one of my favorite restaurants. I took a date there late on a Saturday night - it was perfect! The food was delicious, the cook entertaining, and the ambiance unique. I will definitely be coming back.

I just had the best mocha in my life! Great location off the light rail near Campbell. Unfortunately my first visit was during finals week and the place was swamped. I waited 10 min for my mocha and then found that no one knew of my order. But they responded well and quickly brought it right out to where I was sitting.

These folks are sincere and friendly. I stop in when I have appointments in the area and upon each visit I'm impressed. For one, the coffee is delicious (Americano) and the food is good with a great selection. This place has everything you need; if you'd like  to relax on some comfortable furniture or if you're there to pull out your computer and get things done. I think the shelf, a few inches above the tables and just a few inches wide is ingenious, it's just great for getting things up and out of the way. I pulled out my Nikon D800 and took a few shots here that I'll post.

Awesome little place. Freshly brewed coffee and tons of teas. Really friendly service too. I hope to see the atmosphere spiced up a little more (ie paintings, photos, or any other sort of art).

I really liked this place. The staff was very friendly. The food was amazing. The relaxing atmosphere on the patio was sublime.  The prices were slightly more than I'm used to but given the quality of food and the memorable experience it was well worth it.

Simply delicious! I love the noodle soup (Pho). I like the side plate the comes out with sprouts, fresh mint, and a lime wedge.  The place is operated by a hard working family and each dish I have there reminds me I made a good choice coming in.   The chairs are hard, and since I lost 40lbs. following a hospitalization, I really need a cushion. Perhaps I'd go with five stars if I was a little more comfortable.

What this place does, they do very well! Perhaps I should say he does well. I've been in a few times and each time it's a friendly Italian man. The place is authentic. Like a little piece of Italy. The espresso has a bold and smooth flavor and in just a few ounces - like an espresso in much of Europe. The Gelato is the big feature though. It is so creamy and smooth. It has become my go to cold refreshment.

Delicious food and friendly staff. They serve complementary chips and salsa and they're salsa is about as good as it gets. Today I had a shrimp burrito which included avocado in what seemed to be a home made tortilla. The indoor seating is colorful and the outdoor seating is along a south facing walkway - perfect for that winter sun.

This place has some of the freshest food in the valley and their prices are unbeatable.  It's a non-chain place for a quick and tasty bite.

Compelled to write an interview after 15 visits. I just finished a delicious piece of Quiche. Perhaps the best I've ever had. Even the crust was delicious. I've been coming to Echo ever since I ended up in the Phoenix Valley recovering from injuries following a traumatic fall. I've come in with my wheelchair, walker, and now a cane and I've found the place to be handicap friendly and the staff help me out. The bathroom door is a bit heavy to push in a wheelchair. The only thing keeping me from the fifth star is that there is not a pitcher of water and cups set out. After finishing a delicious entree, coffee does little to quench the thirst.

Review update. I still love this place and I love their coffee, but, today, something changed... I love sipping coffee using their classy white mugs - been doing so for years. Today, even after I was asked, by the cashier/barista and said "yes for here", it was served in paper cup. Not a fan of sipping hot liquids through cups with plastic tops and whatever they're lined with.  I love their coffee too much to have it that way, so, I went out to my vehicle, grabbed my camping mug, and paid for another one. Please bring back the nice white mugs when drinking in house... A little frustrated about paying for that second(replacement) cup...

Ceramic mugs, delicious coffee, and awesome baked goods. All that satisfies the tongue and tummy. The great ambience and comfortable environment also make it a great place to meet friends or get some work done. I also love the accessibility. I started coming here a couple years ago. At that time I was in a terrible accident and was getting around in a wheelchair. The ramp up to the plaza, the open space, and the roomy bathroom with bars to grab were an asset! Back on meet feet and still loving it here!

Great food! Great prices! and nice and clean. My parents normally stay away from Thai food and other food deemed exotic but I have sold them on this place. They have a great lunch menu with around 15 options and they're all $7.00! What would bump it up to five for me is if their servers were Thai. I've asked two who appear to be East Asian but they're not Thai. I've spent the last few years learning the language and love having the chance to practice it.

Great food and great beer selection. I can give it that fifth star after I check out the bathroom and eat inside. The patio was cooled ceiling fans and misters. They had Mirror Pond on tap - one of my favorites! I ordered a Salmon dish that included leaks and asparagus. It was delicious!

I am so impressed! I thought everything out here was just strip malls and chains. It made finding the place a little difficult. I didn't expect one large free standing building surrounded by desert, trees, and picnic tables.  I walked in and was even more impressed. This place had options. The coffee shop is simply under the same roof as an olive mill. In one corner there are outstanding breakfast and sandwich options, gelato and pizza in another, and locally pressed olive oil sold in the center.  The coffee, was great and the ambiance superb.

I was happy to find the Ranger IPA on tap. Went to watch a football game with friends and found the tv screen side of things to be just right. The reason for 2 stars is the food. It reminded me a lot of cafeteria food in Junior High. I ordered a burger and found the quality of meat to be a bit low. I like that the fries still have the edge of the potato on them but they were far from crisp.
