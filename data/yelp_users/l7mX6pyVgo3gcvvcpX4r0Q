Chino Bandido.  Very unique restaurant.  You wont find anything else like it.  Fusion between Mexican and Chinese cuisine.  And with practically all the entrees or combinations available, you will be aware of the mixtures of tastes when you eat.  Maybe I appreciate the concept in a personal way, as I am a creation of a Jewish father and Indonesian mother.  When you first walk in - you will quickly note that ordering procedure is goofy.  Fear not because they have a special side station where they take in new people, offer tasters of all the dishes and help you with the process.  Thinking like a good process engineer, I can envision better efficiency but I suppose this works for the staff who I'm sure have been working there for a long time.  Rather than thinking about a thousand possibilities, I figured out that I will take #1 & #7 (jade red) with some sort of fried rice w/o beans, every single time.  And I suppose there isnt too much Mexican about that choice.  So why do I give it a 2/5 star rating?  First, I can always count on enduring an MSG bomb moments after absorbing the meal.  I hate that.  Second, after seeing the Food Network "Diners Dives Drive-ins" special about the restaurant, I now have seen what makes the food taste so good.  Lets just say lots of the saturated fat content that I typcically try to avoid.  Finally,  its not cheap.  On the positive, at least after eating the entire contents of the silver pie tin, no one leaves hungry.  ps.  If big, cheese, greasy, and tasty is what you are thinking - I suggest having the #2 chile rellano.  You wont be disappointed.

Oh how I love the new Movin 97.5 - I think it was when I heard a great amount of 80s Freestyle jams on this station, I stopped in my tracks and froze the radio dial on this frequency.  I may be a very extreme case, as I have made listening to Movin into a lifestyle.  I am an MVP listener where I score Bonus Codes at practically all the opportunities, email the DJs about Nina D's silliness or Robert's cheesehead devotion (ok i have a lot of freetime), and most even created my own spreadsheet and MP3 library at home of the itunes playlist complete with album art.  The music?  Lately, they have taken the pedal off the metal with the amt of Freestyle / Disco tunes.  But I love the dance lean & I'm always in a good mood with whatever choices the DJ makes.  Today and back in the day!  And whats more awesome, on the weekends, they alter their programming with the "double play" weekend where you hear tunes that you cannot hear anywhere else, only if you had a time machine or cassette tapes.  The programming?  When its a local DJ, they are great.  But I was heartbroken that they put Ryan Seacrest in syndication from the 1-4pm hour.  It was a real problem with me for the first couple days, they treated the DJ AM plane crash news like a national story of interest.  Like most people of Phoenix, I have no idea who this guy is and would rather hear about more relevant local news.  Besides mental tuneout with "On Air", I love hearing the DJs interact with the listeners.  The highlight is in the morning directs many morning topics and hands out giveaways for the *most extreme* circumstance.  The creativity of various talking points make listening to Lukas & Nina's banter very entertaining.  Its definitely a huge improvement daily frustrating stale morning brain benders.  Interactive with the listeners!  Since I first started listening, the station has found more ways where listeners can participate and this is more fun.  Probably the most famous is "Pick your Purse, Choose your Shoes".  I fantasize about having my name called, grabbing a huge bag and tall boots and telling Nina that I am keeping them for myself.  And hopefully they will host more listener events so I can participate in person.  This year, they hosted an 80s party at Wrigley & Singles Night at Chase Field.  And most recent, they have become more involved with promoting the Phoenix Suns - my favorite NBA team!  So I will give the new Movin 97.5 a 5/5 rating.  Definitely a highlight of my week on Monday afternoon when Robert Lewis starts his slot, he reminds the listeners that the Green Bay Packers are America's team.  Win or lose, he's speaks about his pride in the Pack.  But I cannot forget after a most crushing overtime loss in the NFC championship game to the New York Giants nullifying a cheese Super Bowl in Phoenix, a party for our lifetime.  With great anticipation to hear Robert recap that game, he chose instead to promote the upcoming Hannah Montana concert.  Yes, I guess it hurt that bad!

When I want to hear the music from the old school, Mega 104.3 is the answer.  Only being born in 1977 and recently becoming a fan of R&B, I really appreciate having this choice of frequency.  The music?  Spanning from the Chi-Lites / Spinners of the 60s to the Mariah Carey / Next of this decade.  And I love that a majority of the music is from the 70s - 80s.  Recently I heard a tune by a group "La Flavour" called "Mandolay".  An old retro track that I have never heard before - despite my love of disco music and euro retro.  I really love this radio station for playing the retro tracks that I discover and the songs that I love.  The DJs?  The morning guy Alex is solid, less of the goofy hijinx then the previous manic hispanic.  The beatiful Angie Gomez is very informative and pleasant on the ear.  And later on, the station becomes more participatory with the listeners, old school fool Raoul like having his "mega moment" and taking the 104th caller for prizes.

Those who have been lucky enough to stroll into the Dark Horse Sports Bar in Chandler (SE corner of Ray / Rural) have found a real treasure.  I know when I came in for the first time, I felt like I had come home.  This has become my preferred sports bar to watch the big game and yes I am giving this a sparkling review.  The TVs?  Just as everyone likes.  Flat screens-a-plenty.  High-Definition standard.  And the premier TV is a giant featuring the game everyone wants to see.  NFL Sunday Ticket, ESPN Game Plan, ESPN Full Court, Big Ten Network, MLB Extra Innings, NBA League Pass, Mega March Madness.  You name it, theyve got it.  Within the first few moments when I stepped in, I saw someone flop the nuts at the Main Event WSOP.   Speaking of - Poker Night is hosted every Tuesday.  Also for the musically inclined, theres a Rock Band & Karaoke night staged later in the week.  Happy Hour specials offer many discounts.  And during any football game, its nice to know these specials are always honored.  The menu fare - order any entree and you wont leave hungry.  I recommend the bacon avacado cheeseburger.  The drinks.  You will find many beers on tap, all the spirits, and wine.  And my greatest sense of comfort with Dark Horse is when I go into my favorite bar & ask for "the usual" - they know what I want!  My only complaint about the bar, is there is no Ms. Pac-Man tabletop console.  Since I am the best player I have ever met at that game, I regrettably cannot leave my unbeatable high score mark at Dark Horse.  Where the Longshots are the Favorites.

Bar Louie is my go-to bar.  Having been into this bar dozens of times, I have built a great rapport with many of the staff and regulars.  In my mind frequenting all of the West Gate bars and restaurant, this stands head and shoulders above all the rest.  Why?  The food is the best quality, the pricing is the best value, and the entertainment is the best!  The food.  I typically order the same thing each time because it really hits the spot.  The California Club.  And if you are like me where you choose not to eat delicious french fries, its nice they offer substitutes.  I would also recommend the Pot Roast Sliders, very few places and very few items can be found in the valley as nice as this!  The pricing.  As a Jew living in the Avenues side of town, I am always on the hunt for a bargain.  Not only is the cost for your food and beverage reasonable, it is much more fair than the places that surround it in the immediate vicinity.  I cannot lie, this is a big reason why I will keep returning.  And on Tuesdays, you can enjoy their delicious burger for $2.  No Joke.  And wings are $0.25 on Mondays.  Entertainment?  There is a Latin Night on Wednesdays and everyone in the Westside knows you better get inside before 9pm on the weekends or else wait in a line more than a hundred feet long.  Those who frequent the place get VIP privlidges where they can forgo the wait and cover.  And as much as I love the cholas, I love to mix it up in the dance floor.  I've found that everyone is friendly, I feel comfortable making conversation with everyone.  And if its AZ Cards home game, I am here before and after the games.  My favorite thing about Bar Louie.  Is that I can walk home when I'm crunk.  I cannot say this about 99% of the bars in Phoenix / Scottsdale.
