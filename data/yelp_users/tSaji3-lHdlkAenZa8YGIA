When I moved to Dallas in 05, one of the first things I looked for upon my arrival was a Rubio's. Imagine my shock and total dismay to find out that the Big R had not migrated out here to the Big D yet......   So on a visit back to see the fam last week, I made multiple stops at Rubio's and stocked up on the magnificent fish tacos and the shrimp burritos. One of my friends asked me (on the third visit) if I had gotten sick of Rubio's yet....I looked at him like he was from another planet. Sick of Rubio's? Could he really be serious????  Besides the great food, reasonable prices and friendly staff, this fast food joint sells Corona beers...what more could one ask for?

I finally realized I was addicted to the shrimp burritos when I dreamed about eating one.......if loving a burrito is wrong, I don't wanna be right.  PS - If the Big D does not open a Rubios soon, I may have to consider relocating.

When I lived in Phoenix, I usually prowled around North Phoenix, Tempe and Scottsdale; avoiding venturing anywhere south of Broadway, west of 7th Avenue and east of Alma School. Yes, I admit it...I was a North Phoenix Snob......but I have reformed my ways and on a recent trip back to the desert, a group of friends suggested Si Senor for a great "New Mexico style" Mexican meal.  All I can say is Booyah!!! Si Senor (despite the cheesy name) delivered respectably as promised.   I had the sopapilla stuffed with beef and covered with a not too spicy red chile sauce, and my friends all got the sampler platter, or as they referred to it, the "pig platter". Their description would prove to be accurate and it was a sight to behold...three strapping men who could NOT finish everything on  their plates. For desert we had cinnamon and sugar dusted sopapillas (okay, I had them since everyone else was wallowing around in their chairs miserably) to which I added copious amounts of honey, of course.  I would have given five stars here, but according to my local piglets, Si Senor has raised their prices recently, and now charges for refills of chips and salsa. In my book, bottomless chips/salsa are a requirement  for any Mexican restaurant.

Four Seasons resorts, in general, are five star kinds of establishments. I, on the other hand, am not a rockstar who can always throw down the moolah to frequent said five star establishments. That being said,  my best friend and I dropped by the bar on a Saturday night and enjoyed, well, let's just say NUMEROUS, chocotinis.    We sat out on the patio and enjoyed the beautiful view of the Phoenix skyline twinkling in the distance. The hotel staff were friendly, courteous and attentive. Magically appearing when needed and otherwise invisible when not. When the temperature started to cool down and we said we would like to remain outside, our waiter brought us a couple of comfy blankets to keep us warm.   My friend had her wedding here in 2005 (and it was nothing short of perfect), and she comes by at least once a month for dinner or drinks. Given the level of service I have seen the times I have been with her, it is easy to see why.

My family has a long history with the town of Wickenburg, but that is not why the Horseshoe Cafe got my five stars....oh no....they earned every single one of them. Let's break it down, shall we?  One star: Reasonable Prices Clarice is right - you can get a hearty breakfast or lunch for a group of 4 and only be 30-35 dollars lighter when you leave.  Two stars: Variety of Vittles Available Omelets? you got 'em. Breakfast burritos? You got 'em. Biscuits and Gravy? You got 'em. I think you get the picture  Three stars: Portions are LARGE We went in for breakfast and I ordered a half order of the biscuits and gravy, with two scrambled eggs. That half order covered a plate the size of a turkey platter. Try the quarter order if you aren't ravenous. It's not on the menu, but they will accommodate your request with a smile.  Four stars: Local Flavor This cafe is definitely a favorite of the locals. We arrived early, but by 9AM, every seat in the place was occupied. There was teasing and humorous banter between the wait staff and the customers, and between the customers themselves. Norm had his Cheers. Wickenburg has it's Horseshoe Cafe.  Five stars: Service, Service, Service There was one waitress, hostess, and all around caretaker handling all the seats in the house. Deb Thompson knows how to work a room and can whip out the one liners better than Chris Rock taking on a heckler. She exudes warmth and comfort, and the cafe was full of happy people as a result.

When I lived in Vegas, I often sent a silent prayer of thanks to the franchise restaurant gods for plunking an El Pollo down minutes from both my house AND work! Chargrilled chicken served in a variety of ways, along with a surprising number of side dishes (for a fast food chain, anyway) that is tasty and good for you AND your wallet.   My personal favorites are the Pollo Bowl (chicken, beans, rice, pico de gallo, onions and cilantro all done up nicely in a bowl) and the Twice Grilled Burrito.  Muy Bueno!  Now if they would just open one here in Dallas.......

Blueberry Hill is a Las Vegas staple and for good reason. Open 24 hours a day, you can always find great food served in giant sized portions. Although there are several locations across the valley, I have always preferred the one on Decatur for two reasons: it was close to my house and I liked the wait staff, especially after stumbling in at 2AM after a night of revelry on the Strip. Although they serve breakfast, lunch and dinner, in my opinion it is the breakfast dishes that steal the show.   For those hankering a carb overload, try the Stuffed French Toast or the Butter Cream Waffles. Cream cheese, whipped cream, fresh fruit, powdered sugar....sheer bliss! If you like your breakfast hot and spicy, the Chorizo Omelet will should do nicely. Don't expect any sides with this baby, it's made with 4 eggs and is stuffed to the gills with chorizo, peppers, onions cheese, rice, beans and the kitchen sink if you want.  Although the prices have increased a bit over the past few years, you will be hard pressed to find a place that can match the quality, serving size or quick and efficient service that is found at Blueberry Hill.  FYI - If you are planning on going with the fam or friends on a Sunday morning, get there early or be prepared to wait awhile. And yes, people WILL wait.......

Comedian Brian Regan deserved better....and so did my friend and I. Perhaps I should have thrown comparisons to other similar venues out the window, but there are just certain staples that are found (and should be) at most places that host live entertainment.   Let's start at the door: Talk about unorganized. No lines just a sea of bodies, people doing the push and shove (which is unacceptable unless it's at the Nordstrom Rack), and harried and cranky ticket takers.   Clear and visible signage to direct you to the correct location: Negative. We walked halfway around the darn place before we realized we were on the OTHER side. Good luck trying to find someone to ask directions (see the note about the ushers below).   Ushers: Here is a quote: "Um, yeah, your seats are over there (points in a general direction and then turns away). " My companion and I looked at each other perplexed since we had just came from "over there" and that was not the right area. Bad usher, bad.   Seating: Appropriate for individuals the size of two year olds, not for the average size adult. Every time the woman next to me took a breath, I could literally feel her inhaling and exhaling. Only her doctor or significant other should be that close to her, and I am sure she felt the same way about me.   Cherry on Top: I wanted a glass of water. Nothing fancy, just water. My companion got up and made his way out to the lobby. When he came back, he had 1 beer and 1 glass of ice cubes. The line he got in did not serve water, and when he asked for a glass full of ice cubes to compensate, they got all pissy with him. I guess I should be glad they didn't make him pay for it.   Dodge gets one star automatically for having Brian Regan grace their location. The other star is for the pre-show rolling text messages across the video screens. It is an interesting concept and great way to keep the audience entertained beyond the usual onslaught of advertising material.

Location = Convenient. The brewery is literally a hop, skip and a jump from Sky Harbor Airport (well, when you are not in rush hour).   Atmosphere = Trendy College Kids with a sprinkling of Trendy Grown Ups. By 6PM, this joint was hopping and people were spilling out of the patio onto the sidewalk.   Beers = Tasty. I am not particularly fond of beers, but the Arizona Peach was a winner. I then graduated to the Kilt Lifter and that's where my memory goes fuzzy, but I hear that I had a great time.   Parking = Nonexistent and the only downer to an otherwise great time with good friends.

I used to travel frequently for business, and being based in Vegas for a number of years, I spent a good amount of time at McCarran International Airport. The Big Mc gets 4 stars from me for several reasons:  1.   This has got to be one of the BEST places to indulge in my secret pastime of people watching. It doesn't matter what time of day or night, there are always INTERESTING folk either coming or going into Vegas. There is also an over abundance of celebrities (A-list through D-list) and in January, the airport is overrun with porn stars in town for the annual AVN Awards.   2.   McCarran has continually evolved; adding amenities not found at other  airports (hello, there is a 24 Hour Fitness center on site), some pretty decent cuisine (Blue Burrito Grill, Gordon Biersch, Uno Pizzeria, Wolfgang Puck Express),  and a plethora of places to get loaded while you wait to catch your flight back home. The Jose Cuervo Tequileria is a favorite. 3.   The airport is surprising neat and clean (relative term) compared to other places such as O'Hare, LAX, Hartsfield, DFW or Denver. 4.   If you are in a gambling mood and want either one last shot at the big money, or are just arriving and can't wait until you get to a casino, McCarran has slot machines EVERYWHERE. For some reason I found the ongoing chant of "Wheel of Fortune" strangely comforting when waiting for my flights.   NOTE:  Just a hint for those out of towners, though.....I lived there for 5 years and never heard of anyone hitting the jackpot at the airport.  One downside can be the long waits in the security lines, but then again, this IS an airport in one of the most visited destinations in the world. Expect that travel in on a Friday and out on a Sunday or Monday will require more time to get through the security checkpoints. My advice to those cranky after 3 hours in line? Hit the Tequileria once you get to your terminal, you will feel better immediately, I promise!

Yeah yeah yeah....I hear you.....the food is not the best I have ever had, but you gotta admit that the guacamole they make to order at your table is downright heavenly. I am not sure why the other reviewers felt the drinks were sub-par...maybe I am just a lightweight when it comes to alcohol but I thought the margaritas were yummy.   Bottom line: Cozymel's is getting 4 stars from me for the patience exhibited when myself and a group of girlfriends held an impromptu bachelorette "pre-party" party in their bar. Take 6 drunk, LOUD and obnoxious girls, add a naughty bachelorette cake and assorted naughty party gifts, and you could potentially have a 4 alarm fire on your hands. The bartender and waitress were good sports, and he even came out from behind the bar for a bit to wish the bride-to-be well. Awwwww......  PS - Plus they gave us some free appetizers too!!!! Ummmm, maybe that was to help soak up some of the alcohol.....?

Oh. My. God. Capriotti's is da' bomb!!!! Hands down, the best samich is The Bobbie. Think of the best Thanksgiving turkey meal you have had, and then put it between two fresh pieces of sourdough bread. NOTE: Get it toasted if you are really feeling frisky. I would seriously get on a plane and fly to Vegas just to have one. The tuna is a close second (IMHO) and the Sausage comes in for the bronze medal. The 20" is enough for two hearty meals, and a warmed up Bobbie tastes even better on the second day.

Flashback to the 70's....picture Henry Hill, Jimmy Conway, Tommy DeVito and Paul Cicero crowded close together in one of the red circular booths in a darkened corner. Can you see it? This is how I felt when I walked into Durant's the other night after seeing Brian Regan at the Dodge Theater.   Red velvet flecked wall paper, dark carpeting with a design straight out of a casino and bartenders in ties......this place was the bomb. Our waitress was professional, attentive and efficient. You can tell that some of the wait staff have worked here for years (but not like in that "I work in a dive diner because I have no other choice" way). These people CHOOSE to work here, and you can tell they love their jobs. This attitude comes through in how they treat their customers.   While I was not that hungry and only had a salad and baked potato, my dining companion ordered the fillet mignon, scallops and garlic mashed potatoes. When he said the scallops were the best he had ever tasted, I skewered one and gave it a try....the rush must be what heroin addicts feel when they shoot up for the first time. It was perfect! Although the fillet was tender, the flavor was a bit off; however even at less than 100% it beat most steak places hands down. My baked potato was anything but ordinary...twice baked and stuffed with cheese and other gooey goodness, it was a meal in itself.   For dessert we ordered the strawberry shortcake for two. When the waitress pulled up in the crane to drop it on the table, we realized this thing was really for five or six people, not two. The strawberries were covered in a sweet and light glaze, which did not soak through and make the short cake soggy (I hate that).   We ate in the dining room in front of the bar, which afforded us a delightful view of the incredibly diverse crowd that came in that night. It was both a culinary and visual delight.   The cherry on the top? Exiting through the kitchen. As I left I thought I could hear the faint sounds of "Layla" drifting through the air....or maybe it was my imagination.

Once upon a time on a lovely September day, my best buddy and I booked facials, massages and spent an entire day at the lovely JW Marriott.   I was immediately impressed with the sheer size of the spa facilities and the hotel grounds in general. Prior to our appointments, we donned our workout gear and hit the gym on site, which had a nice mix of treadmills and elliptical machines, as well as a couple of contraptions I had never seen before. We worked up a good sweat and headed for the showers, which were well stocked with all the toiletries and assorted bathroom sundries you could ever need. The waiting areas for the treatments were nicely appointed and had some of the most comfortable lounges I have ever lounged in (and I like to lounge around, trust me).   My massage was immensely relaxing and my esthetician Del was an absolute doll. The only teensy weensy minus was the somewhat slow service at the spa cafe and the expensive gift shop. Candles for 70 dollars?   I came in feeling like a washed up dollar bill and left looking (and feeling) like a million buckaroos. Speaking of money, If only I had a million, I might have been able to afford one of those snappy t-shirts from the aforementioned gift shop.......

Four words for you: Don't. Believe. The. Hype.   Happy hour on a Friday night seemed like a sure bet for a fun time. Guess again folks.   Music = ear drum busting and sucky Drinks = Margaritas overpriced and underweight Food = Bor-ing Service = Um, hello...is there anyone here? Crowd = The freaks come out at night   I'll give Loco Patron two stars for the drunken monkey antics of  the people out on the patio. At least they were entertaining.

The current incarnation of Sonio's Cafe has been revamped since a raging fire burnt the original one down in late 04 (or was it early 05?). Fire be damned, Sonio's is hands down one of the best rotisserie chicken cafe's I have ever visited.   As noted in the last review, this is a very popular lunchtime destination. If you are not there by 11:15 AM, expect a full house with a line out the door and around the corner. Thank goodness the wait staff are experts at moving the crowds through, so while you may have to wait, it is usually for not longer than 10-15 minutes.   My all time favorite dish is the Mexican Caesar salad. Served up in a bowl the size of a large kitchen colander, you get a mountain of greens and roasted chicken, all done up with just the right amount of a spicy version of a Caesar dressing. Add in a couple of handfuls toasted pita bread crumbles, and you have the perfect salad/meal! I have also had several of the pitas and wraps and was equally impressed and satisfied with the portion size and quality.   Even if you don't work (or aren't staying) anywhere near their location on the corner of Charleston and Valley View, this is one place that makes a trip across town or away from the strip absolutely worth it!

A hungry group of girls (most from out of town) + Pure  = Yum!  We could not have picked a more beautiful day to have lunch out on the patio at Pure. For those of you who have read some of my previous reviews, you know that sushi is not necessarily at the top of my list of lunch choices, but when in Rome.......  The atmosphere was cool and chic, but not pretentious or overbearing. Our waitress was very friendly and within minutes of sitting down, we had popped open a bottle of champagne and were toasting our resident birthday girl.  The lunch menu was extensive (and not all about the raw stuff - yay for me!) and we had a hard time deciding what to order. We finally selected the Edamame for starters, then had several of the Creamy Bake Lobster rolls (sheer perfection , I tell you!), the Shrimp Tempura roll and the Sashimi platter. I ate heartily from the Lobster and Shrimp rolls, but left the Sashimi to the hardcore sushi worshipers.   Overall, the food was 5 stars, but the service became somewhat lax throughout the meal. Our waitress was nice enough, but it appeared that she might have been overbooked with tables.

When one thinks of the Wild West, the state of Arizona is usually close to the top of the list. Playing an important part in the development of the Southwest, Arizona has some wonderful places with historical significance for all you history buffs.  The Vulture Gold Mine is one of these places. Just outside the town of Wickenburg, the Vulture Gold Mine was discovered in 1863 by Henry Wickenburg. Although Henry sold the mine after a few years, the mine went on to become the most productive gold strike in the history of Arizona and sparked the development of Arizona and the city of Phoenix.  The fee to participate in the tour is $10, but it is a small price to pay for the sheer volume of information and artifacts that are on the property site. The tours are self paced and on-your-own. When you visit the tour center, you receive a comprehensive overview of the mine and it's history from the current caretaker, as well as a map that identifies the points of interest.  Most of the buildings, while in various states of disrepair, are still standing. Many contain original furnishings, machinery and reminders of everyday life such as cooking utensils, cans and bottles for coffee and such. One such building with a large variety of these items is the Assay Office, where the gold was stored prior to shipment.   There are some areas of the mine that are not open to the public, but since my grandfather worked at the mine, the caretaker gave us full reign to wander all over the property. The schoolhouse where my Uncle John attended school is still standing and contains a piano that we are certain he played as a child. The swings, slide and teeter-totter are still there and my mom could recall memories about those days despite the fact that she was just a toddler when they lived at the mine.  If you ever have the opportunity to visit the Vulture Mine, take it. I am an Arizona native with family ties to the mine and I still learned a ton of information about what an important part the mine played in Arizona's history.  PS - While you are there, don't forget to scratch Olive the burro's ears!
