I have been here a lot as I lived almost walking distance of it for years.    Unfortunately I haven't been back since they added some new beers, I've heard they now have an IPA which is great to hear.  KO's is a true family owned bar and restaurant which is now run by his daughter.  This is something that I value personally because in Scottsdale everything is corporate.  KO himself is a great guy, and as I result I like spending my money there.  They have poker nights which are always fun along with trivia night which is surprisingly fun.  In terms of food, this is one of those places that has a rather large menu.  Normally I would criticize this but in KO's case I love it.  Often times my girl and I can't figure out what we want for dinner and in those cases heading to KO's is the best option.  You can get Mexican, American, Italian, or whatever you want from the menu.  I've never had a bad meal here and I've ordered just about everything off the menu at this point.  The honey hot wings are my favorite of any wings I've had in the valley and surprisingly the pizza here is very good too.  The sandwiches are great, my girl's go to menu item is the Turkey Bacon Swiss (TBS) which I would recommend myself.  The sweet potato frys here are probably the best I've had in the valley, it one of the few places that actually get them crispy.  The patio is great here, KO allows and sells cigars which I like.  It almost like hanging out in someones backyard but you have all the food and beer at your fingertips.

They deliver a higher quality service than Danny's but take much longer.  I won't knock them for that because it's to be expected with the higher level of service.  But you should be aware that you're going to spend at least 20 mins for your $15 wash.    Fortunately the facilities are excellent so grab some BBQ and watch the game while you wait.

I have been shopping at various Fascinations over the years and its always a great experience with the staff, this company has done a great job recreating the image and feel of a sex shop and mainstreamed the whole experience.  However my issues sits with this one location as I have now had two bad experiences at this store.  This weekend we my girlfriend and I stopped by to pick up a mask for her mother who was going to a Halloween party that evening.  They had a large selection of mascaraed masks so we took a picture and texted the one we liked to her mother.  Out of no where this beast of a slob comes running out literally yelling at us that we can't take pictures, in pure shock of the situation I asked (genuine curiosity, not being a dick) why we can't send a picture text of the product.  She proceeds to talk down to me by explaining that I'm in a "sex shop" as if I was 3 and didn't know shit from shit lol.  So we went on there website and texted the same image from there.  As if anything was different by doing that, the dumb bitch was satisfied and I was turned off to spending anymore money or time in this place.  I just took the mask and checked out where they proceeded to try to up sell me on every fucking product in the store.  Great sales model, offend the customer then beg them to buy shit they don't want.  I would spend money with this business in the future but never at this location as I have now gone 2 for 2 with bad customer service here.  I wish I caught her name, because the other girl working was very nice.

This was my first trip to Tap Haus and I didn't quite get the same experience of shitty service that many have been complaining about.  Our server was good, always on top of our table as we were there to do some drinking and a little eating.  However the managers on duty were a different story.  We arrived and were being taken to our table by the hostess when a manager stopped her and pulled her away to give her some random task while we just stood in the middle of the restaurant like two idiots.  I'm sure whatever he had to tell her could have waited the 45 seconds it was going to take to seat us but I digress.  I'm not Mr Important by any means, it was just awkward.  The food wasn't pure shit but it wasn't anything to write home about.  We ordered the chips and salsa which was definitely Pace Picante from a jar.  The hot wings weren't hot and had an odd taste of game/fatty that I couldn't put my finger on.  My burger was ok, don't bother ordering to temperature though as my medium rare came out well done.  I opted for the sweet potato frys as it's a personal fav of mine and they were soggy and blah.  Again, it wasn't the worst nor was it great and my expectations going in wasn't that I was about to have a great meal.    However one thing I will say was bad was the beer.  I was thrilled to see the quality selection of beers, especially hop knot from Four Peaks which is one of my all time favorites.  The problem here is that the beer is WARM.  If I had to guess it's probably somewhere between 40-50 degrees and that is not something that's easily forgiven.  Despite this review, I would go back but manage your expectations.  If it weren't for the warm beer, I'd give it 3 stars.  This place has some good potential if they would just improve a few key things.  Ohh and one last thing, we went on Comedy Night.  Wow what a shit show those comics were, it was funny just to watch them bomb but that's of no fault to the establishment.

Myself and my girlfriend decided to come check out the new place after hearing about the atmosphere and outdoor environment.  Being fans of Sam Fox in general, it was an easy risk to take on a Friday night with perfect weather.  The place just opened so I expected it to be packed especially with the perfect 80 degree weather we had.  Parking is a mild issue but they provide complimentary valet which is nice.    When we arrived we were told it would be an hour to an hour and a half wait which we were ok with.  They use an app that alerts you via email and gives you a party count that updates as tables turn.  I really liked this as we were able to roam and have some drinks out in the yard all while having a good idea of our tables ETA.  I have read that some people have experienced reservation issues and unfortunately we witnessed this as well.  As we were about to be sat, a group of 8 got there page and came to discover that the host made the reservation for two because she saw two people.  I felt really bad for them knowing they waited just as long as us and that they would have a hard time getting a table for 8 right in the middle of the Friday night dinner rush.  Some have complained about the noise, it is loud but this isn't Maestros and you should know that.  We don't have kids but I did like that it's a family environment, very cool concept that I would like to see in North Scottsdale.  The crowd as a whole was very good as well, no hipsters, bros, dickheads, frat guys or yuppies.  I really enjoyed the couple hours of drinking and eating we spent there and will return.  I'm not really going to get in to the food too  much because it's nothing new if you have been to Culinary Dropout.  The ribs, fried chicken, pretzels, and sandwiches are all good.  I've never had a bad meal at Dropout, the menu holds no risk to most diners.    My overall summary, of all the Sam Fox restaurants this is the coolest/most enjoyable place in my eyes.  I will return many times, despite it being a bit of a drive from North Scottsdale.  If it weren't for the great environment, I would give it 4 stars simply for the stellar menu, but it really is as good as it gets for someone like myself.

Hop knot on tap, a menu full of food to please the fat kid in me, it really doesn't get much better.  Service has been great on my many trips in with the old lady, we live across the street and there aren't many good spots at this price point in the area.   This is a bonafide sports bar but the big upside is that they actually use fresh ingredients unlike local spots like Zipps and Tilted Kilt.  The burgers are good and all sandwiches come on good bread with fresh toppings.  Any of the chicken items are actually real chicken breast, no frozen chicken fingers which is rare.  If you're feeling extra fat, go for the Monte Cristo as it's pretty damn amazing despite sounding like a fast track to diabetes.    My only desire is that they would buy UFC fights so I can stumble home safely but maybe that would ruin this little gem.
