ABSOLUTELY INAPPROPRIATE! I setup an appointment with Stanley, who claimed to be the gym general manager, and asked to take a tour of the gym and receive some information. Stanley appeared to be under the influence of substances, as he was fixated with his cell phone, stuttering, and could not keep on one topic for more than a  minute. Stan started by asking me my nationality... I responded, and he then felt compelled to show a half naked picture of his "girlfriend" who is of the same racial descent, and proceeded to scroll through multiple pictures of her modeling (was this why I came here?). He started our conversation off with his girlfriend, "the supermodel" (nothing to do with the gym membership).   Stan then asked me about my Gucci handbag, and claims his aunt in Detroit is a fashion designer, and he gets free Gucci merchandise due to her high status in the industry...AGAIN, nothing to do with my sole focus of the meeting.   After a brief tour of the facilities, Stan brought me back to his cube and proceeded to continue to be fixated by his phone, showing my pictures of instagram pictures of half naked women in thongs. One of his examples, he claimed to train, as she appeared to be a competition body builder. He said, and I quote, "We banged it out in my garage for 3 months straight...well, not BANG it out...haha you know what I mean."   I had only been at the gym for 15 minutes, and the sexual innuendos did not stop there. Stan then went on to reminisce about himself (because, you know, this meeting was all about him) and opened his photo album on his phone, once again, to show me his body during his "football days". NOTHING was accomplished during my "meeting" but a slideshow of naked women, and attempting to speak business with a man who can't hold a sentence.   As the "meeting" adjourned, I told Stan I appreciated the tour (the meeting, not so much), and will be touching base with him after more research. Stan made ZERO eye contact, and continued to scroll through his phone. When I got up to say goodbye, he did not shake my hand, did not stand up, and again NO EYE CONTACT, and said "later" as he scrolled through his phone of naked women, and his football selfies from 1984. I called Stan 2 days later, asking why another LA Fitness was offering a better deal, and if he can match their price since this location was closer to my home. He said they were different entities, and I thanked him for his time and he said "Yup" and hung up the phone.   If Stanley is the gym general manager, LA Fitness should seriously consider drug screenings and hiring proper, professionals to represent their company. I will NEVER become a member of this gym, and will never refer.

Came to Big Heng's, as I've heard great reviews for mandarin cuisine. Was promptly sat, and waited over 15 minutes for the server to return to take our order. After several attempts of eye contact and waving at other servers/ restaurant employees... We still sat hungry, with our waters. At the 20 minute mark we left, and will never return again.

Awful! Went to enjoy St. Patrick's day festivities with some friends, and was harassed by two women at the bar ordering drinks. They called me 2 racial slurs. I kindly asked the ladies if they would like to order before me (as they were clearly angry with my presence of being another ethnicity), and they continued calling me the slur and laughing. My friends came over, I told one what just occurred and she simply asked the women if they called me the said racial slur. One of the girls signals a McFaddens security guard (her friend) who asks to have my friend removed from the bar. I go outside to confront the McFaddens security guard, and proceed to ask him why the ladies calling me racial slurs were not removed, however myself and my friends were. He proceeded to confirm those ladies would also be removed. This never occurred. I have the entire conversation on video, as well as lack of promise that culprits were removed from the establishment. The staff at McFaddens is not a place you would want to give your money to if you're a minority, as they not only promote, but encourage racism.

I decided to try a grooming salon, in hopes i would be get a more professional cut for my 2 year old yorkie, and also to be able to build a good relationship with my pup's groomer (as any human would with their hair stylist). Trust is always a big factor, and by trying this groomer out, I was sure to be impressed. The initial phone call was very pleasant, where I spoke with Sherry. She was very polite and bragged about her 16 years of grooming experience. She was also very persuasive in informing me new customers will receive $5 of their first groom, a bath, and doggy facial. From this phone conversation, I was under the assumption this was going to be the beginning of a very good grooming relationship. The day I dropped my pup off at this location, I was greeted by Sherry, eating her lunch in the front of the store. She beckoned another employee to take my companion, and I was asked how I wanted the cut. I explained I wanted the coat short, and face trimmed. I could be wrong, but typically, when I think of a good haircut or groom, consistency and "even-ness" is essential. I also asked to show the Sherry a picture, and she rushed me as my phone loaded, and said "how about I just make him adorable". That,statement of confidence gained my trust.  2 and a half hours later (which was quicker than I had anticipated), I showed up 10 minutes later (3pm, and they close at 3:30 on Saturdays) to a shop with a "closed" sign, and an angry "Connie" glaring at me as I walked in. Connie was literally, staring at me, as I waited for the prompt of my total. I then has to ask her how much I was to pay, as Connie's verbal skills clearly were not present at that time. I saw Sherry packing up her things and I said "thank you", prior to seeing my pup, and I was dismissed by her as she continued to gather her things. While I was given the $5 off as promised, when they brough out my pup, it looked as if they were grooming blindfolded. My dog still had sticky areas around his face, the coat was completely uneven, the face area was botched. In addition, my dog did not smell any better than how I brought him in. I am now writing this review, after my best attempt at fixing my poor pup's mane. The price and location may be ideal, however there is no customer service, and their "grooming" skills are extremely poor. I am a firm believer in giving tips to people in the service industry, however I also give credit where credit is due...and in this case, my tip when right back in my pocket. That being said, I will continue to go to PetsMart grooming, where the cut is even, the bath provided gives my pup an amazing scent, and I am not left having to trim up their mistakes. I will be forking out the extra $5 at Petsmart in exchange for my awful experience today.Do NOT go to this grooming salon.

The motif and layout of the buffet is deceiving, as it's nicely designed for easy buffet maneuvering. Hot & sour soup was watered down, seafood selection was minimal: clams, squid, FRIED crab legs, and cheesy variations of "seafood". Meat was tough, orange chicken was primarily just batter, and vegetables were cold. To be honest, I enjoyed the fruit and green tea iced cream the most. I paid $11.99 for 2 pieces of watermelon and a scoop of green tea iced cream. This place is not recommended by me.

GREAT FOOD. AWESOME SERVICE. We had a few servers throughout the evening as I believe we arrived during a shift change. Nonetheless, we still had EXCELLENT customer service throughout the transition (especially before a SUNS game- busy time). The manager, Joshua was great. He validated our parking ticket and ensured our check was accurate. Highly recommend this awesome restaurant. ***TRY THE MULES!!!

BEST PHO IN ARIZONA!! BEST broth, all natural chicken, great crispy rolls, AWESOME happy hour. Staff is amazing (Jackson & Michelle) and owner Tom so personable!! I recommend Angelina's to any pho-aholic!!! We dine here usually twice a week or more... This place is clean, CLASSY, modern, no FOB zone. Very trendy, hip, with traditional amazing food.

Biscuits cafe is amazing! I ordered the chicken fried steak, which was cooked to perfection, on top of a massive slice of buttery hashbrowns, 2 over easy eggs, with 2 of the fluffiest pancakes. Service was amazing- our server was attentive, fun, and gave great recommendations. The portions were monumental (eating my leftovers as we speak- so good 2nd time around I had to Yelp!) upon paying for our bill, we were offered drinks to go, and was given a "venti" sized refill for my coffee. Great food, exceptional service, definitely making this breakfast spot a weekend tradition!

Koi lounge is by far the best spot on that strip. Customer service. Drinks. Music. Management. Bartenders. HANDS DOWN.  IF you're looking for a great time come to KOI.

While the service was excellent, and our server was very accommodating and extremely friendly, our signature cocktails and food were less than pleasing. I ordered the seafood hotpot. Not thrilled. My friend ordered short rib me fly over rice... Also not impressed. Great downtown ambiance, but I was expecting more with the food in terms of portion size and taste for the price.

Restaurant was completely empty... My party of 3 was the only table. Our drinks too a very long time. The bar promotes various beers, all of which were out if stock (probably shouldn't advertise).  While I didn't have the sushi, the street tacos were mediocre.

This place is delicious! I went with 2 other foodie friends of mine, so we could each sample the delicious menu items we read about prior. I ordered the Cobb salad- it looked rather small, but that was truly deceiving. One of my friends ordered the south of the border waffle sandwich, and other friend ordered southern hospitality waffle sandwich. We also ordered the asada fries. In addition to EVERY plate tasting amazing, the bottomless mimosas for $12 can't be beat. Now I don't have to drive all the way to central Phoenix for s great mimosa brunch. Service was excellent, food was amazing, and I highly recommend. Will be coming back for sure!!!
