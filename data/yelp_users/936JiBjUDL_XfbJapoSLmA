Please, save yourself the agony and do NOT move here. I've been nothing but stressed since I've moved in.   Pros: *Decent sized space (but not worth the price) *Convenient location  ...and that's essentially it.   Cons: *Infested with roaches. I started seeing roaches the night I moved in. They are the worst to get rid of and they refuse to have the whole complex inspected. I personally sprayed, I set up traps, I had them spray, I fogged my place three times, and finally got them to fog my place after much resistance and a call to the health department. I'm still killing and finding roaches even after all of these treatments. I started sleeping with the lights on because I was so afraid of stepping on one if I got up in the middle of the night.  *My closet smells musty/mildew-y and so does the air when the AC comes on. Within a week all of my clothes and towels smelled musty and its terrible. I bought two order eliminators for my closet and that barely helped. I had to buy FOUR plug-in air fresheners for my bedroom/living room which helped a little, but I know it's just covering up the smell.  *Maintenance requests take weeks and there's a serious lack of communication. When you move in, you have to inspect the place, report any damages, request maintenance if needed, etc., which I expected. Majority of complexes do that. I requested a new sink faucet for the bathroom because the old one was eroded. I waited over a month for the sink parts to come in, was told it came in, waited a week for it to be installed, and they said "well there wasn't a leak but we replaced it anyways." I never said anything about a leak.  *There's only two garbage bins for the entire complex so it's constantly overflowing. If you get within 15 feet of it, it absolutely reeks.    *Utilities aren't included so while the rent is  decent-ish, I'm paying at least another $150 for water, sewer, trash, and APS. My water has gone up significantly since I moved in. It used to be $30-$40 for my water and now it's $85. There's absolutely no way I use that much water in a month considering I live by myself. So either their meter is off or they're ripping me off.  *They don't give out gate codes. You either get a key card or remote (which costs extra) so if you have guests over after the gate closes, it's a huge pain in the ass to get them inside.  *The staff in the front office stop caring about you once you sign your lease. When I was given the tour and talking about the terms of my lease, they were very friendly, informative, and seemed generally interested in my well-being. This immediately stopped when I was given my keys. If I ever have a question or concern, they're very short and snotty with me or they immediately "let me have the manager call you back" and don't even bother trying to answer.   Please. Do not move here. I wish I would have listened to the other reviews.

I don't know what this persons problem is but Sharper Vision Eyecare is NOT what he is saying it is. The entire staff is perfectly friendly, the doctors are even better, they have an amazing selection of glasses, the wait time is good for an office setting, and they definitely DON'T push you on upselling. Yes, they do ask if you're interested in different eye tests and they list the price but once you say no, that's the end of it. My family and I have been going there for 8 years or so and we have never once been disappointed with anything. They always have taken great care of us and we've never had a problem with insurance. If I could give them 100 stars, I would.

Let me start off by saying that I love Village Inn; I have always have and I probably always will. But this is the first time I've received horrible service.   I called to put in a to-go order and at first the girl who answered was nice. But she put me on hold 3 times while I was trying to place my order so I had to keep repeating it. Then she hung up on me. I called again and this time a guy answered, I told him what happened, and he apologized for it and took my order. I ordered a Turkey Bacon Avocado Melt with no red onions. I should have checked the order when I picked it up but I didn't, so now I know in the future to do that. When I get home my sandwich has no avocado, no tomato, but it has red onions. I get that people make mistakes but this is a pretty big mess up. I called to complain and the girl who answered said "Oh, I'm sorry. Can I put you on hold?" No, you can't.   Definitely won't be going back to this location.

I stumbled upon Shampoo Ink's Yelp page a little over a year ago and I'm SO glad I made that first appointment with them. I always schedule an appointment with Carley and she's beyond amazing. I'm always hesitant to go somewhere new because I have really curly hair. Stylist's have botched my hair in the past but Carley gets the style and color I want every. single. time.

I love Stand Up Live Comedy Theater! They have a full bar, over 60 types of beer, great food, an amazing staff, and awesome performers! It also has great pricing and it definitely a great place for a night on the town! I was recently there to see Dana Carvey and my server, Christopher Gribble, was absolutely amazing. He knew the menu like the back of his hand, made great recommendations, and was constantly checking on us to make sure we were okay and had everything we needed. He also works at Copper Blues which is right next to Stand Up Live and that night, he was working at both places. Even though he was doing that, he was still amazing and was always there!The next time you go to Stand Up Live, ask for Chris Gribble and he'll make your night amazing!

This was my first time ever getting a spray tan and I was super nervous. Ann did a great job explaining the difference between standard spray tan and the airbrush technique she uses. It really put my mind ya ease and now I'll look great for my sister's wedding! I will definitely be going back.

I know this is long but it'll be worth the read. One of the reasons I picked this place is because it's close to the ASU downtown campus which is where I work and go to school, it's moderately priced, and the utilities are included--which is great.   But, I've had a lot of issues with management not keeping their promises and sometimes it seems like they don't value me as a tenant. When you sign the lease, there is a specific section that states you cannot have or smoke weed in your unit or anywhere on the complex, which doesn't bother me either way because I don't smoke. My neighbor, unfortunately, does and the only reason it bothers me is because it makes my apartment smell like weed. The first time I complained they told me they would walk over with security within 10-15 minutes and check it out. NOTHING happened, at all. Sound travels pretty well in between apartments and I heard nothing, no movement, no knocking on their door, no one walking outside, nothing. Considering weed (according to management) can get you evicted, I was very surprised when they didn't do anything. I complained a second time a few weeks later and made someone walk over with me, he confirmed that he could smell it coming from their door and that my apartment had a hint of it, too. Still, nothing happened after that. I'll probably just call the cops next time.   About 2 weeks after I moved in (In July, mind you) my AC broke and I had strep throat so I was burning up. I understand their busy and it's a big complex, but something like that requires immediate attention because a broken AC in the middle of July makes the apartment unlivable.   There was another time that my plumbing backed up so there was water rushing out from under the toilet and the tub wouldn't drain. As simple as it is, luckily I know how to turn the water off for the toilet because their EMERGENCY maintenance guy lived (at the time) an HOUR away. Even though I had turned the water off, it was still leaking but if I hadn't, my apartment would have been flooded by the time he got there. When I went in to see what was up with that, a manager very rudely said "Well, we can't tell our employees where to live." Yeah, no kidding, so how about you don't hire someone who lives an hour away then, especially when they have to respond to emergencies.   A little fed up with the office but other than that, it's a convenient place to live, the apartments are nice, and there is a lot to do in the surrounding area.

First time here and I absolutely LOVE it. This was my first time getting my hair professionally done and Brittany did a fantastic job. The salon is so personal and she really paid attention and listened to what I wanted. She has ten years experience so I felt safe in her hands. I am definitely going back! Even better, it's very affordable for a hair salon.

I was so nervous to try Orange Theory because I'm not in the slightest bit of shape. I was afraid of being judged, ignored, or not taken seriously. I have NEVER once felt any of those things. OT is by far one of the best places I've been and I can't recommend it enough. I've been going for a month now and I've already lost 10 pounds. The trainers are so attentive and they've helped me so much with my technique. They genuinely care about your progress and make an effort to know you by name. I've never been more motivated to get in shape and I'm so excited to continue working out here.
