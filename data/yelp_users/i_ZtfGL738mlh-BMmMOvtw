This place is great. The burgers were excellent. Passion fruit iced tea was awesome. I would have given 5 stars, but my french fries looked like they came from the bottom of the barrel. I would recomend this place to others.

They have good food. Showed up an hour before closed. Had to wait forever even when nobody else was in the restraunt.
