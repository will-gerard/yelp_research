This review is about the Attendants (Ushers). Has a group they are totally unfamiliar with the seating plan.  ****They'll send you to ANOTHER door, for BEST ACCESS to your seats. ****Guess what, you were previously at the BEST DOOR.  I have a feeling, that these Folks, are volunteers.        MANAGEMENT should not put, unknowledgable staff, on the floor.

*************Nothing To Get Excited About*************  They pretty much ........ know their business. Yes ..... they're less money than .......... buying cartridges at places like OfficeMax.  I now buy ALL my inkjet cartridges .......... ONLINE, at amazon or eBay. No, I don't buy the Manufacturers brand ........ the generic ones, cost me $2.25 each, with Free Shipping ....... when I buy 10 or more.  I have found that my Cartridge World purchases, last just as long, as the Online purchases.  I've noticed ........that 7 days a week ....... Week after Week .........this Cartridge World, along with ...... ALL THE OTHER LOCATIONS IN THE VALLEY, have RAVING reviews posted for EACH location in the valley.  ..........and the NEXT DAY Yelp ......... has deleted them. Hmmm ....... FYI ....... Self Promotion, is a Violation.

*********** THE VALLEY'S GREATEST  ************              *********** 5 STARS *************         Every purveyor of Hot dogs, Hamburgers and Italian Beef Sandwiches        in the Valley, needs to MATCH THE CHC EXPERIENCE.      CHC, is THE GREATEST PURVEYOR of the above sandwiches.....BAR NONE.            For those of you who believe, you found NIRVANA ..... because you           spent $10 to $15, for a burger elsewhere ....... You'll come to           realize ........ THAT YOU'RE NOT THE BRIGHTEST BUN in the oven.  Put CHC, on your "To Die List" .....as for the other places ....a SH*T List, will do.                                       I rarely give 4 or 5 star ratings                        More Than One Star .....  HAS TO BE EARNED  The Food is Right On .... never a negative experience.      The service is outstanding.          The entire staff, has a great attitude.                The only problem ......... their way to busy.

Yes, I remember the Chinese food of my childhood. It was the "best of the best". No, I don't expect to ever encounter it again. Super Dragon comes close. The service is great. Things have a tendency to come out of the kitchen too fast. So, give your server, your order in stages. Prices are very reasonable.  If you're a Tightwad ... you'll be able to relax here !

*************Has This Happened To You ????**********     **************There Were Plenty Of Vacant Tables Available*********   My wife and I WAITED a good solid 5 minutes at the hostess station ....... it was UNATTENDED for the entire 5 minutes. In addition another group was waiting behind us, for almost the same time period.  I asked a server who was passing by ...... wheres the hostess ...... he managed to find her.  At this point, we and the other group had been waiting for approximately 7-8 minutes.  The Hostess, based on her age appeared to be the Manager on Duty ......... informs BOTH PARTIES .... there will be a 5-10 minute wait.   NOT ACCEPTABLE, were the words expressed to hostess/manager by myself and the other party ...... she REFUSED to seat both groups, even though we had now been there a solid TEN MINUTES.  I and the other party, left WITHOUT DINING at Chili's...... I dined instead at Mimi's, and didn't have to put up with any attitude.  The Manager/Hostess was a Redheaded lady, probably in her early thirties.  This experience has left a BAD TASTE, in regards to Chili's and Brinker's.  Has a statement of my disgust, My family will be boycotting all Brinker's owned business.

WHATS WITH THE CONSTANT ........... Raising the menu prices ?????  If the practice of "Comping" athletes and a particular Elite Group (see link) ended, you'd be ABLE TO LOWER PRICES. http://www.yelp.com/biz/championship-dining-experience-for-elites-at-don-and-charlies-scottsdale  Have you lost sight of the fact ........ that this will PISS customers off ? Recent diners will, pass this info along ....... to Family & Friends'. Will I, still eat at D & C ......... YES, when I have a coupon or Groupon, as I did this Evening ......otherwise NEVER !!   Its obvious  business must be suffering ...... has you're doing Groupon, quite often. This is always an indication, that an established restaurant, is experiencing a decline in revenue (probably due to frequent price increases).  Folks' wait for a $40 Groupon coupon (purchased for $20).  $24.95 for a full slab of Baby Back Ribs, last night .... is ABSURD.          You just raised the PRICE AGAIN .....use to be $22.95 There was available seating the entire Evening .... HMMMM, wonder why ?? P.S.    5 years ago, the Baby Back Ribs were OUTSTANDING.                Through the past 5 years, they've slipped each year.                      It's time to clean up the appearance, both inside & out.

*********** Used Another Groupon************  NOTHING has changed ........ However you'll love this  I viewed, a great encounter at the table next to us ....... One member in the party of 4, asked for the manager ...... He showed up, and the Lady asked if he knew So and So ........Yes, he did. They chatted for a few minutes, and he left their table.  When, their meal was finished, he stopped again ..... and announced that dessert was ON THE HOUSE. They had their desserts, and requested their check.  This group of 4, presented their $40 Groupon ..... for which they paid $20 AND ALSO presented a $25 D&C Happy Birthday email.  The Waitress of course, said you can redeem one ..... but not both, at the sametime. Well, THIS BIG SHOT OF A CUSTOMER, asked for the same Manager, who had COMPED 4 desserts, again.  HE CAVED, and both certificates were applied towards the tab.  ******If You Haven't Read My Previous Review .........

This location is back sliding. I've been going here for the past nine years.  The Wait Staff is OK, however, dosen't hold a candle to the  Wait Staff of yore.  Prices are sky rocketing here. Totally out-of-control. "Good Egg", your food is good, but, overpriced.  We live five blocks from this location. The closest IHOP is two miles away (raintree & the 101).  If its Tuesday, we'll eat at the Good Egg. Tuesday, is double punch card day.  Any other day we head for Ihop.

Its loaded with skinhead type Teenagers, that gather in herds. They are always blocking the walkways. They are visually disgusting. They'll degrade any positive experience, you might have from your visit.   As I said earier, visit the water activity area ... when you have leisure time. AVOID this center, otherwise.

Cox, is no Angel. However, they're not the Devil.  Anyways, its a given, that EVERYONE loves to hate Communication providers.  Apart from the obscene HIGH RATES, the field personnel, are quite able and capable.  When it comes to the Customer Service folks. Its OMG (oh my G_d). They for the most part, couldn't find their way out, of a room with one door.  So, whats the solution. There is none ..... until telepathy becomes a reality.    By the way, you haven't come full circle, until you've had the Qwest (now known as Century Link) experience. Avoid this experience, at all costs.

Thank goodness that the sauces Didn't all taste the same. That in itself is a real plus ...... when it comes to a Chinese meal.

Over the past seven years, we (Wife and I) have dined here, about 6 times.  We had just left the Theatre ... saw a wonderful Sherlock Holmes play. ****Arrived at Alexi's, at 4:45pm, on Saturday 22nd. ****Restaurant is empty, with the exception of three tables. ****Hostess, is insistent on seating us , in "cubby holes" or corners. ****Told Her .... NO. ****We'll dine elsewhere if necessary. ****Finally, we were offered a "proper" table.    As other Diners, were arriving, she's playing the same "cubby hole" game, with them. TSK ...TSK ...Where is the ownership ????? Then again, it appeared, she was "following orders"!                                   Now For The Food On this visit, and ALL past visits, I always have  the Chicken Marsala Southwest. My wife, on this and past visits, always has the Chicken Piccata. *****Both were over cooked. *****Both were BLAND. *****Both were not the entrees, we had come to expect at Alexi's.                                     Bread and Salad *****The dinner rolls were tasteless....Thank Goodness for the Butter and salt on the table. *****The House dressing on the salad was ICK (my wife) ...and YUK (me).

Pancakes with a PEDIGREE ..... I think not !!!!! Its been a few years, since We have gone to this location. Nothing memorable, about our visits through the years.  This FRANCHISEE .... does not take IHOP coupon's.  The IHOP of our choice, has been at the 101 & Raintree.

GROSSLY OVERPRICED !!!  This is a Franchise ..... not the Orginal. My opinion ... the food dosen't match up, to the original. Mind you .... its OK, but certainly not Great. This location is 4 miles from my house. I drive past them, on my way to eat at Taste Of Chicago, for my dogs.  My wife and I, usually don't agree on many things. However, we agree on  giving Luke's a pass.

"Run of the mill food". We've been there twice since they opened. Nothing to get excited about. Its the kind of place you'll try every year ... to see if its improved. So far, it hasn't !  When I want BBQ Ribs or Chicken ....... I smoke my own ....... Then finish them off, for 2 minutes on the gas bbq.

I and my Wife, dined here this evening.      I felt, the pricing is a bit over the top.      The burgers were somewhat-OK ....... not the fantastic ...... I was expecting.            For the price ....... I would of expected the burgers ..... to be hand formed. The burgers were not dry ....... just not juicy.                  The tables that seat two individuals, are TO SMALL ........ barely room for the plates.  OUR server ......was a Young person ...  who spent her time in the backroom.                            So our srevice was  Mediocre.                    Overall I was disappointed with our experience.  My Ethics .... My Standards: Every business starts with one star ...... GETTING MORE ....

I was not disappointed .......... the service and food were Very Good.                    You'll find a  Quality Meal ....... with Quality Prices.                   From the Hostess to the Servers ........ its all Ten's.   About the Food ...... Throughout my life ..... I've had better Italian. This is Upscale Dinning ....... its more about the experience ...... then the Food. Conversations with your tablemates ....... are almost impossible ..... Extremely Noisy.           By all means ........ Try it Once ........ Then decide for yourself about return visits.                          Me ......... I'll be back ....... every 2 or 3 months.

Amazon.com .... How much is a customer worth ???? You use On Trac, because you save a buck or two.  I hope that Tomorrow is the day, when their incompetence costs you more in claims, then you saved.

Dumbest group of employees ... all in one location. Employees, here's a hint: Best not to list H & M, on your next employment application.        Doing so, is guaranteeing, you won't be hired.   The clothes are Kmart/walmart cheap. The sizing is NEVER ACCURATE.

This will NEVER be a shopping destination, for me ! Unless I need to visit THE APPLE STORE, I'm staying away.  For the most part, the center is a collection of OVER PRICED restaurants and clubs. If YOU need your ego (or other parts) stroked, by barely 21 year old female WANNA-BEE'S .... Take a VIAGRA and your wallet, with you.  The parking availability is terrible. Plus the Valet reserved zones, have made it shopper unfriendly.

They are super expensive, No I mean ULTRA EXPENSIVE.  They'll find an entire pecking list of things, that they'll suggest, you let them repair.   I wouldn't go anywhere near, any of their multiple locations. If you enjoy. being played ... any of Greulich's many locations, will obligue you.

Overpriced. Nothing special or unique here. Better QUALITY available at Albertson's or Safeway. Better PRICING available at Albertson's or Safeway.  In another year or so, the proliferation of  Yogurt & Cupcake Shops, will end.  These Franchises are a bad business investment. THE NAIVE, will soon learn, to avoid FAD businesses.

I'LL CONTINUE........going to Taste Of Chicago.....where $5.68 + tax gets you a dog fries and drink.  Better yet ...... the Valleys best ..... for Italian beef and Hot Dogs     is CHICAGO HAMBURGER COMPANY on Indian School  This place is just........not up to the COMPETITION

Definitely, not-a- step-up .....nor is it, a step down, from your typical Greek place.  The only step-up that occurs, is the step-up, on Dinner prices. The same items on the Lunch menu.......... step up in price on the Dinner menu. Was this learned in Greek Business 101 ??  My Wife, likes this place. Me, I don't feel good about, being advantaged.  Their Happy Hour, is a good deal. I give them an OPA (thats the shout they give, when they light THE Saganaki).  For details on Happy Hour & menu prices, see their Web Site  My Ethics ....

********** If you're a fan of BROASTED CHICKEN ....... This is "The Place" ***********  I did a Google search for Broasted Chicken ....... I came across the Manufacturer  of the Broasters .... Walla ..... I discovered The Saddle Bronc.                    http://www.broaster.com/slocator.htm  The Chicken was scrumptious ....... I had the 2 piece with 2 sides ($8.99). They permitted me to eliminate the Wing ..... thus I had 2 breasts .... with no up-charge.  They've got a bunch of other choices on the menu ..... along with 30 different Drafts on tap.  Arrived at 6:30pm we were seated immediately ....... they already had a nice crowd. Since this was Saturday ...... Live Band ....... began at 8pm.   The wait staff were exceptionally Friendly ...... a real nice plus.

********I Found Another JJ Location ....... That Sucks*******  This one.......and the one located on Cactus......must be the same Franchisee.  Carried out two sandwiches.......both were disgusting.   (-) Want extra vinaigrette on the side ........ they don't have the small plastic cups.  (-) a newborn Rabbit would STARVE on the amount of lettuce on the sandwiches.

This is a borderline Upscale Italian Eatery ........ The interior decor is outstanding ......... Thankfully, its not trying to be the priciest ...... yet !!  Its been open for about one month ..... Located in a building, that has seen many restaurants, come and go .......  I predict, that Vito's will be a huge success ........ IF ...  they're wise enough, to avoid being on the edge of being overly expensive.....  The food and service, were outstanding this evening ...... They have Specials on various Weekday Nights, checkout their website, to see whats what ......  www.vitospizza.com  Many, including me ......have an unfavorable opinion of those, who DO NOT LIST MENU PRICES, with their online menu's.        ************** ARE YOU EMBARASSED ????? **************  My Ethics ....

The Taste .......... of our chicken dish was Delicious. The Other Entree .......... was a Steak dish which was also Enjoyed.

****** Horrible Parking ......Horrible Lines ...... Horrible Hoard at Pickup Window ********                          Italian Beef Sandwich ....... Amazing                         Chopped Salad ................. Amazing                          Hot Dog Sandwich ............ So-So  The Hot Dog Buns ......... Were Soaking Wet.  Thus the flavor and crunch of the condiments were totally destroyed by the WET Soaking BUNS ...... Management: Here's a HINT ...... 2 Shakes of the Wrist is a cure.  The Staffing overall are doing a great job ....... at keeping everything flowing.   Give Portillo's a shot ....... however avoid the WET HOT DOG BUNS ...... For now. 'Cause they don't shake the water off the dog ...... and to make matters worse ......they wrap the entire sandwich in paper ...... creating a Sauna like enviorment.    Can't wait for the crowds to reduce to a reasonable level.

*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*- Their Shea Location Shines *-**-*-*-*-*-*-*- THIS location on FLW ...... is not Pita Jungle at its best ....... but rather at its WORST.          (+) Last night ..... Sunday ...... I placed a carryout order by phone.       (+) I arrived on time for my pickup.        (-) I was required to wait an additional 20 minutes beyond my pickup time.    During the 20 minute wait ....... I had ample time to observe .....        (-) Chaos ..... Chaos .... Chaos       (-) As the bags came out of the kitchen ... It often took 5 minutes to callout                      the name of the customer ...... not a good thing ..... when food will be traveling.       (-) 2 out of 3 carryout order had errors.       (-) Expressionless faces on those who were waiting for a table.       (-) For the most part the food was BLAND and DRY.       (-) The noise level ..... is worst then Flo's across the street.       (+) Food Freshness was good.  From the mumbling from the Folks in the pickup area ...... along with those waiting to   be seated ...... something has got to happen.        Either, It won't take an eternity to get this location ........ up to speed.        Or it'll be avoided as the word spreads.
