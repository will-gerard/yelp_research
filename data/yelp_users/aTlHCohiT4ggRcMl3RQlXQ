Great Pizza joint... A little on the pricy side for pizza, but if you catch a lunch special or something its not too bad. Ive been coming to this place for years and its good every time.

Food is good but the service is brutal. Although I must say last time I was in it was good. But I've been coming here for years and the service for the most part is bad. The wings are really good, espically if you ask for extra crispy. The cheese steaks are okay. Happy hour is very cheap. Overall its an above average sports bar.

Behind the Mask is the best hockey store in Arizona hands down. Randy and all of his guys that work their are very knowledgeable about hockey and all the new equipment. Last time I went in I needed some work done on my skates and a 20 dollar mouth guard, something that would cost about 80 bucks at the other pro shop in my area, only cost me 40 at BTM.

Walmart just runs a gong show everyday. The aisles are always blocked and all the workers are always in a bad mood, I don't blame them though I would be too if I was treated as poorly as they are. Walmart is good for if you need something when your drunk at like 3 in the morning and everything else is closed.

This place is delicious. Great food and when they cook in front of you they do a lot of cool tricks and stuff. I would eat there everyday if I could afford it.

First of all, this is a 0 STAR review... They made me put at least 1. I have been a member at quite a few gyms around the area over time- this being the worst. I joined Gold's because of the convenient location. This is where my mistake begins...  I sign up for the $16 membership, which is supposed to let me bring a guest every time. When I bring my guests every single one of them gets assaulted with numerous phone calls for the next month pretty much begging them to come in and get a membership. (One phone call is okay, i get it, but I am bringing people in as my guest which I am paying for monthly.) MINUS 1 STAR FOR HARASSING MY GUESTS. ANNOYING SALES PEOPLE.  I go to the gym at 4:30 pm... Gym fully packed. I get it. Primetime.  I go to the gym at 7:00 am... Gym fully packed. I don't get it. Not even a squat rack open. I can't even imagine what this gym would be like on the 1st of January. MINUS 1 STAR FOR OVERCROWDING.  I get charged a sneaky $50 annual gym "rate guarantee" which is supposed to be used to upgrade equipment I was told. Yet no visible upgrades going on??? If you need ideas I will give you some: New water fountain that shoots higher than 4 centimeters forcing me to slobber my big lips all over the faucet! New gym equipment!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! MINUS 1 STAR FOR SNEAKY UPGRADE FEE WITH NO UPGRADES THAT ACTUALLY HAPPEN.  Staff is overall rude over the past 2 years. There has been 1 or 2 good staff members but they don't stay working for Golds long, and I can't blame them. MINUS 1 STAR FOR RUDE STAFF   Finally I walk into Gold's Gym Scottsdale ready to end it all. Put myself out of the misery and cancel the membership for good. I break the news to the (new) receptionist, she doesn't say a word to me just hands me a little piece of paper. I try to decipher the message and it says to email Jonas to cancel? Im thinking who the hell is Jonas? and I email him anyway. No reply.  I call Jonas...I get an automated message telling me to email him. So I email again... No reply. So I figure I am finally done with this crap and I am so happy... WRONG. Then 1 month later I get hit with another monthly bill!!!! I had to then forward my original message to "Jonas" over 1000 times in a row to make sure he didn't forget and it worked!!! But not before I was hit with a final fee of $54!  MINUS 1 STAR FOR NON HASSEL FREE CANCELLATION.

Decent Mexican food for a good price. Great spot to come on a short lunch break with a few buddies. The Horchata is amazing I would highly recommend it, some of the best Horchata I have had.

Very good cheese steaks, best in AZ. I do not know why they only have 3 stars. This place gets my business at least once a week. It is a little pricy but its not terrible if you dont get fries and a drink, just get a water cup or something.

Ive been here twice and both were terrible experiences. I would not recommend going there for the nightlife, drinks are over priced and they kicked my friend out for literally no reason at all.  We were sitting at a table with 4 other friends conversing and security just randomly came up to my buddy and said "you need to leave right now you are too intoxicated." He didn't even get to finish his second drink. I think it was because we were taking up a table and not spending a lot of money on drinks or food right away. Not quite sure. When I respectfully asked the security what happened and what my friend did to get kicked out he was disrespectful and brushed me off like he was too cool. He just said "intoxicated" and walked away. We went over to City North after and had no problems the rest of the night.   I will NEVER come back to Sandbar. After reading other reviews it looks like I'm not the only one who has had this problem.
