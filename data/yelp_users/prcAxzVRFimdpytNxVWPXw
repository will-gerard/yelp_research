I have been to see Dr Rosenberg twice now, and I'm looking forward to my next visit.  The office staff is very friendly and efficient.  The scheduling is easy and quick.  And most of all, Dr Rosenberg...what can I say?  He is a gem of a doctor.  He is one of those doctors who seems to appreciate his patients, and not just their pocketbooks or insurance payments.  I just get the impression that he enjoys people.  As far as actually taking care of business, he's quick and painless and does a fantastic job of numbing you up and slicing off whatever ails ya.  He explains your options and is mindful about what it's going to cost you out of pocket, so he takes that into consideration when recommending treatment.  I would never go to another dermatologist...I just wish he was a general practitioner so I could go to him for everything!

Pretty standard crappy laundromat.  About half of the machines are broken, most annoyingly ALL of the double load machines which are the most cost effective for my laundry needs.  AC is marginal, and I am actually pretty sweaty in here.  The driers seem to work well and are pretty cheap
