Sean and the crew at Unique Car Audio are the best!!  I was in a pinch, needing to get my stereo fixed the night before trading in my truck. Nobody could get me in, and Sean couldn't fit me in either. Then I plead my case and he said, "man, that's a tough spot...bring it down and we'll make it work."  One hour later he had me back on the road!!  This is my new shop of choice, and will happily refer family and friends!

The Baer's Den is my bar of choice in Arizona!  Hands down the best service I have ever gotten at a bar, it's like my own Cheers.  Literally when I walk in I am greeted with my name by any of the bartenders, the cook staff, or Scott the owner.  I host a Red Sox fan group that meets at the Baers Den and I can say without hesitation that the ENTIRE staff goes way above and beyond to make our experience a great one.  As far as the parking goes?  Yes space is limited behind the bar itself and that is a shame because it get packed in there from time to time.  There is plenty of signage behind the bar including a sign that has got to be 4' x 8' hanging on the back of the building that has a VERY CLEAR message about parking illegally.  If someone is unable to see the signage back behind the bar, then they shouldn't be behind the wheel to begin with cause that person is putting the rest of us with eyesight at danger.  If you are looking for a great bar with friendly people where the majority of the patrons know each other, then THIS IS YOUR PLACE!   By the way, notice how the only bad review came from someone that parked illegally, and by the owner who didn't want to self gloss and call his bar the best (which it is)?  By the way, the bar has been in business for over 50 years!  That doesn't happen to places that are not GREAT!  Also, good luck bothering the Police and the City with this matter, it's private property so it's a civil matter not a criminal matter.  You sound stupid, occupy self responsibility Lori F!

Corban,  I'd invite you to look at the fact that we all have bad days.  I can't speak on your experience personally of course, but I can say without hesitation that Rena is one of the nicest people out there.  Maybe you happened to catch her on a really tough day?  Just a thought. How great would it be for you to give it another try and come back with a positive experience!  I've been a regular at this bar for over 11years and feel like I can say with confidence, your experience was a rare one.  Give the Den another try, and I bet you'll be glad you did.

This place could be great if not for the owner!  While having a conversation with the manager about a very small issue (and we where having a pleasant conversation) this old man walked up and stood behind the manager.  I asked the manager, "who is this gentleman?"  Turned out to be the owner who proclaimed, "I OWN THE F*****G PLACE, THAT"S WHO I AM....WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM!?!?!"  I asked the manager if I'd said something wrong and he stood quiet.  It was clear he deals with this a lot.  Maybe it's because his boss sits at the bar and drinks and then tries to interject when he clearly shouldn't.  The story goes on from here, but I digress.  My friends and I paid out tab for one pitcher of beer (so we where there less than 20 min) and took our business elsewhere.  After spending $286.00 at the other location it has become our new hangout.  There is another post here about the owner kicking out a Kings fan....I find that story COMPLETELY believable after what we had happen.  I wouldn't spend ten cents in this place all because of the owner!

Great spot, good food (Taco Tuesdays are the best), and very friendly service!  I have taken many people here and all have enjoyed themselves.  One of my favorite things about a bar is when people are friendly and will chat with you.  I was telling the bartender that I usually go somewhere else and that it was my first time in Bogeys.  Kathy took the time to give me the lay of the land and then asked where I usually go.  I told her and she started asking if I knew certain people from the other bar, and we did.  Now whenever I go back she remembers me (as do other bartenders/ servers) and make you feel right at home.  GREAT PLACE!

Great bar with friendly people.  You won't find a sweeter bartender than Ms. Kitty!  The owners where also very pleasant and fun to talk to!  I would recommend stopping in and giving it a try.

Andrew was fantastic!  My Xbox took a dive and I attempted to repair it myself. After three hours of useless attempts to repair it, and with the realization that my four kids would kill me if the XBox wasn't working on Christmas, I called Andrew.  He got me in and fixed THAT DAY!!  He had no problems answering my questions, and even told me other things that I didn't know.  If you need a fancy shop to make you feel good, this isn't your place. But if you want a good repair done for a good price, give him a call!

As I write this I am sitting on a bench next to the drying/ detailing area.  I've been here over an hour now, and let's look at the reasons why. Three cars that came in after me got into the wash before my truck, THEN THEY RAN MINE THROUGH THE WASH WITH THE BACK WINDOW DOWN, then while I was watching from inside the store (20 feet from my truck) I see one of the detail kids knock the rubber bumper off the bottom of my door, then attempt to put it back on once without being able to, then look around and hide the rubber bumper under my back seat!  That's when I went out and called him out on it.  He replied, "yeah, I was waiting for you to get here."  The lead guy offered to put it on.  At this point there still isn't a refund, or even an offer of a free wash. The only thing they are offering for those errors on their part is a very disingenuous "sorry" that seems like it's second nature to say. So now I go to Cobblestone and buy their monthly pass!

What an absolute joke this place is!  We were told the wait would be 20 min. 45 minutes later we were told 15 minutes & the entire time there were many empty tables, 10 at last count. When I asked why we are all waiting so long the answer was, my manager asked me to stop seating tables for a while. I understand the kitchen needing to catch up, but it was ridiculous & completely unprofessional.  Won't be back until we see the manager name on the door change, because this lady has no clue what she's doing!
