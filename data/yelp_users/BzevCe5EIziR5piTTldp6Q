Ruffino's is truly one of the valley's best italian restaurants. Food is delicious, on the expensive side but worth it. I tried all the food at the table and each dish was well plated, appropriate portions and, again, tasted great. The outside was a little deceiving, it looked rough, but the inside is beautiful. Staff was friendly and stayed on top of the service. We will be going here again!

Very cool place! The atmosphere was awesome and the staff was great. Maggie, our waitress, was on it! Never left you hanging or wanting for anything. The food was good, I thought my meal was heavy on the sauce but thats a preference thing and nothing to do with quality. I will eat here again, I'm looking forward to it!

The food was great and the prices were very reasonable. The restaurant is gorgeous inside and out and the environment was peaceful. Usually when I get large portions I worry about food qaulity, but in this case, I was served a large portion of great quality food.

Poor quality food, I didn't know fast food could be so cheap. Burgers were greasey, they tasted like they had been sitting for awhile. Fries were greasey, floors were greasey, I'm still amazed they continue to get customers. The staff was very nice and I had a ice cream cone that made my bad experience ... not so bad?.

The food is inconsistent! Meaning you could eat the samething and it is different everytime. Chen's is like a box of chocolates... Food quality is poor and lacks taste.  The price is to high for the food you get. It is conveniently located and food is prepared quickly. I won't eat at this particular Chen's again.

I had looked everywhere for 2 box springs and finally looked at Mattress Firm. There prices were more than fair and they price match other stores if there is a better deal available. This location had a very friendly gentleman that was helpful. We will look here first before anywhere else.

The Spicy Gyro is a fantastic sandwich! This is one of my favorite places to eat in Florence, I have never been disappointed in the main dishes. Service is quick and the staff is always friendly. The price is fair and the portions leave you full and satisfied.

I have been here twice and have not been disappointed. Staff are friendly and pay attention to detail. The food is awesome! I have been pleased with both of my dishes. The menu is large, you will find something you are in the mood for. This has become a favorite for us, we will be back and hungry for the next delicious dish!

Large portions at decent prices but the food quality was poor. I ate a quarter of my meal and left the rest. I had General Tso's chicken and hot and sour soup and was disappointed with both options. My wife got orange chicken and again, it wasn't very good food. The food tasted cheap and it was prepared different from other Asian food I've have had.

I live in the area and have been disappointed overall with the YMCA. The pool is small and is not very family friendly, the life guards are disrespectful and unprofessional. They do offer some good classes and the teachers are knowledgeable and good at what they do. The day care center is pathetic and the attendants are almost as careless as the children they are caring for. I travel to a different pool and gym instead of taking advantage of the facility 2 blocks from my home.

This place is a favorite of mine. Authentic cheesesteak sandwiches at a reasonable price. They also have fry sauce!! If you are not familiar with fry sauce, get familiar!  Great location, always busy, but that is a good thing! I'm just glad it's not closer to my home, I'd be fat...ter.

This place has terrible food! The establishment is unclean, tables and floors were sticky, food was still on the floor from previous guests... no bueno! Staff were polite and menu was extensive but again, nothing we ate the was of good quality.

Great environment, staff was friendly and service was fast. Prices were higher but the food quality and choices made up for it. Between all of us we had about 8 rolls and each was very good and the blue wasabi was a nice added touch. The restaurant was very busy and the spaces are compact so you got to meet who you were around. It was loud and hard to carry on a conversation but overall we enjoyed ourselves.

This place is a lot of fun. Dine in or eat out by a campfire! My kids love roasting marshmellows and, on the weekends, listening to the live music. Food is fantastic, I have liked everything I've eaten. If you eat there on the weekends be prepared to wait awhile to order and to eat. Parking can be tricky on the weekends also, but it really is a great place to go.

Sushi was good quality and the facility was nicely arranged. Price was very good, happy hour is Tues-Sat 2-6 which makes the price even better! The staff was friendly, but it did take a while for us to be served. If you're in a hurry this is probably not an ideal place eat. Overall the experience was excellent.

We eat here often and each time leave pleased. Nice for outside dining. Food is great, not your typical "bar" food. Environment is always nice, the decor... is a little much for me, but my kids love all the dig pictures! Staff can be rough looking but always are good at their job and are professional and willing to help. Location is easy to access with plenty of parking all the time.

This is a great place for BBQ. Ribs, sandwiches, everything there is delicious. They have several different types of BBQ sauce which is always a bonus. Service is friendly and fast, and the atmosphere laid back. The mac and cheese with green chile is one of my favorites.

Food is some of the best Asian food I've had in the valley. Service was fast and the staff is awesome. Prices are very reasonable and the menu was very diverse. Portions were large and the food was of good quality. I left full and happy and look forward to my next visit.

The staff is always excellent! They are helpful and willing to go out of their way to see that you are satisfied. I work with this pharmacy all the time, and anytime I've been there I have never had a complaint or problem.

Best pizza is San Tan Valley! Their prices are higher than their competiton but the food is far better. During lunch time you have the option of buying by the slice which is perfect is you need something fast. Their specialty pizzas, specifically the white pizza, is fantastic. The environment is family friendly and a game is always on for the sports fanatic. The staff is pretty good and the time from order to eating is acceptable.

The bar and grill had a fun environment. This is an english pub style establishment with great food, efficient service and live music on the weekends. The menu was refreshing because of the dishes you were able to get, the options are different from most places. I recommend this place if your in the mood for something  a little different.

If my Butcher was this good, I'd be Arrogant too! Great atmosphere, perfectly located for a night at the Symphony or a game at Talking Stick. The staff, awesome...the food, WOW! It wasn't badly priced for the types of food and quality you were served. Its a great venue for a full meal or just a couple appetizers over a business meeting. I will be visiting again to try the next thing on the menu!

Taco Bell is usually my "go to" for fast food. It isn't great food, but for what I pay, I'm very satisfied with what I get. Service at this location has always been friendly and I receive my order quickly.

Nothing against this specific location, but I think I might die several years earlier than I should having eaten at Mcdonald's several times in my life. The food is always terrible, it tastes old. Similar to eating week old leftovers from your buddies fridge...but worse. I feel physically ill each time I eat there! However, they did have an Egg Nog shake, around the holiday season, that was awesome!

I was very suprised with the type of food I have been able to get at this place. I thought it would be your ordinary deli with mediocre food, I was wrong. Food is awesome, every sandwich I have had has kept me coming back. The decor is kind of cheesey but the service and staff have always been above par. They can be slow to get your food out to you at times but the price is right.

Freddy's is a family favorite. Hamburgers taste fresh and the service is fast. The only thing that I'm not to keen on is the french fries. They are way to skinny and if you can find one that is two inches or longer, it's a good day! The shakes are awesome and they offer fry sauce...which is something I struggle living without. Prices are higher than your everyday fast food burger place but the quality makes up for it

This place was an awesome find! The menu is large with pretty much anything you would want to eat... the food was delicious!The environment was very friendly and the staff was great! Chuck, the owner, came out and visited with us for awhile, he was very personable and friendly. I love supporting guys like Chuck and places like Copper Still Moonshine Grill. I highly recommend!

Fine dining in florence? We went here after a grade school event and were suprised at what we found. A small restautant but with a fine dining environment. Food was pretty good, I thought the pizza was better than the pasta. They have artisan pizza that was excellent and the menu was well balanced and had a little of everything. I thought it was expensive considering the location but had it not been in Florence by the Safeway I dont think the price would have suprised me. Great for adults, not all that kid freindly.

Always a positive experience when visiting Deseret Book! The staff is happy and willing to help, even if they are in the middle of a project. The books are enjoyable to browse and the art work available is beautiful. The home decor is modern and fresh and there is always something creative to be found.

This place is suprisingly good considering its location. I've eaten here on two different occassions and each time I have been completely satisfied with the food. Good quality and prepared quickly. The staff were friendly and genuinely wanted to be of service. You don't find that to often in the food industry! If you haven't eaten here, you should. It is located in the Cheveron station.

Geno's is one of my family's safety nets! Whenever we run out of time they are one of our top three options of eating out. The food is good, inexpensive and as long as it is not a weekend prepared rather quickly! So if you're looking for quality pizza and don't want to spend a lot check them out.
