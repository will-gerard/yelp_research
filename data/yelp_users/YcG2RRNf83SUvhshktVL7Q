I can't review the food since I never got my order. I waited for almost an hour for a couple hot dogs on my lunch break. When it got to where I was 30 minutes late back to work I left. I saw a few other people leaving for the same reason. Fortunately some customers got their food in a few minutes and were on their way. The staff didn't care when I asked why it was taking so long. Maybe they don't like the way I look or something...

I left a bad review after my last visit in june. They sent me a coupon for a free eighth for my birthday so I went back (its January now). I like that they gave me free meds which may be swaying my opinion....that being said....best meds I have gotten from them. Only reason I went back was because it was free but may go there in a pinch now.

It would be a cool venue if the staff didn't have such bad attitudes. The fact that I remember the head of security being a douche more so than any of the awesome bands I was there to see equals a bad time....which nobody wants when they pay their hard earned money to attend.  It seems to be the same issues this place had in Tempe. Overly aggressive security....bad attitudes from all the staff...bad sound..overpriced drinks. I will never go to this venue again. I hope 13th floor gets it figured out and finds a new venue to book shows.  Note to the security staff....YOU ARE NOT THE SHOW. PEOPLE ARE NOT THERE TO SEE YOU AND IF THEY REMEMBER YOU...which they always seem to...IT'S BECAUSE YOU AREN'T DOING YOUR JOB CORRECTLY.  Club Red = LAME.
