Finally, found an honest, reliable plumbing company! We quoted about 10 different companies for a repipe on our home (replacing polybutylene with Aquapex), and they were by far the best pricing. On top of that, their service was above and beyond what you would expect. Byron and Robert stayed until 8:30PM to make sure we didn't have to go without running water! This company is a perfect example of how all businesses should be run. I highly recommend them and will use them for all future plumbing needs.

I'm blown away by the quality of this business. From start to finish, the process was enjoyable and stress free. Cosmo (owner) is just a stand up guy who takes a lot of pride in his work. His crew was polite, fast and delivered A++ work.   We originally went to Cosmo with a concept and he counseled us through the logistics and made recommendations where appropriate. The end result of our rustic laminate floors exceeds our expectations in every way.   The buying process was easy and his pricing was far lower than every other company we spoke to. I will without a doubt use him again in the future and recommend him to all our friends.

I had a great experience with Michael for my corporate head shots. He was very professional and I was in and out within 30 minutes. I was able to select from a handful of high quality images and once I culled it down to 3, he retouched them for me at no additional charge. His prices were very reasonable and the end result was very high quality. I will definitely go back and recommend to others.

This place is awesome, start to finish the meal was perfect. Cocktails were unique and very tasty; I highly recommend the smoky mule. The only thing that tops the food and drinks is the service. The entire staff goes out of their way to make sure you have a great experience.

Hands down, the best BBQ in AZ! We had the family platter between 4 people and went home with a ton of leftovers. The price was reasonable, service was great and the food was amazing! We will definitely be coming back.

Rod is great to work with! We received multiple bids and his was the lowest to add 2 rows to the top of our existing block wall and stucco.  His crew was very professional and FAST! In the end, we have a great looking wall and you can barely tell that it was an add-on since he color matched the blocks and mortar. The crew also meticulously cleaned up and left the site looking better than they found it. This company is top notch and we will definitely use them again.

We've been there about 5 times and the service is horrendous. We're big fans of the OHSO concept and love the other locations, but the owner really needs to get the staffing issues figured out at the Tatum/Shea location. Food and atmosphere are great, but the poor service really ruins the experience.

Josh, the owner, was very fast to respond to a quote request for a mister system. He give us an accurate estimate within about 15 minutes, and then installed 3 days later.   He also gave us some recommendations for 4 cool effects that we hadn't even thought of, like foggers around the pool, 5 cluster nozzles over the lounge chairs, etc. The upgrades were only acouple hundred more and well worth it - so glad he recommended them! The crew was friendly, clean, and professional.  The end result was beyond our expectations, and we couldn't be happier with our new mister system. This is the type of small business that you want to work with. I have already referred them to 4 people - highly recommend!
