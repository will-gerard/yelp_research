Went for lunch and was very disappointed. Restaurant smells musty and the food was awful. Service was very good.

We had a private party scheduled for the 3-course chef tasting dinner.  The room was not ready, the menu was not as we discussed (there were meat dishes and we had a few vegetarians), the A/V equipment didn't work.   One of the guests also got a cup of coffee that tasted like chicken broth...the owner came back with some excuse for this, but the issue was not corrected.  We all had been looking forward to this dinner for some time now since we heard good things about this restaurant - this bad experience was enough for me not to return.

Amazing dinner!!  We stopped in before seeing a movie next door. The service was excellent, with very attentive and knowledgeable staff.   We ordered an appetizer that was not on the menu with fresh mozzarella, scrumptious zucchini, fresh bread and an assortment of other goodies. We also ordered one of the specials not on the menu which was out of this world. Strongly recommend this place to anyone looking for high quality Italian food.

Fresh and flavorful food with top notch service.  I'm a meat and potatoes fan and this vegan restaurant is still a favorite!

Spa day with the girls. Treatments were shorter than advertised and underwhelming.  It is a beautiful facility, but unfortunately will not return.

Really enjoyed the pasta and sauces from scratch class I attended last week.  The demonstration before the hands-on part of the class is helpful in being able to make the dishes at home, and the kitchen set-up and assistance made the experience very enjoyable.  Only regret is we didn't bring a bottle of wine with us...should have read the Yelp reviews before going!

Fresh and delicious!  I went at lunchtime and had a chicken tomatillo enchilada and a green chile pork enchilada with corn tortillas, green sauce and habanero salsa, and a side of chips and guac.  I was a newbie and overwhelmed with all of the choices, so next time might load it up a bit more!  The food was very flavorful.  I will definitely be back.
