Best Gyro in Phoenix! Period! I order the Gyro DLX. The feta is awesome. Recommend.

Had a burger with chewy bacon, greasy fresh cut not fully cooked curly fries, flavorless meat. Sauce was good a little on the sweet side, fried pickles were good. Won't go back.

I really wanted this place to be good. Tried it three times. Today I had a chicken California burrito. Mushy rice, bland beans, flavorless chicken. The frozen tortilla wasn't warmed up all the way. Chewy and dense. Friendly staff, fast service. The chips are good if you can overlook them being stored in a dirty looking trash can. This place is not for me.

Well we just finished eating last nights leftovers thanks to the poor service we just received. I ordered a pizza online and received a confirmation email that it would take 45 minutes. About 5 minutes after these guys were due to be knocking on my door with a pizza in hand I received a phone call. They called to let me know that they don't have a delivery driver tonight and asked if I could come pick my pizza up or would I like a refund. I agreed to pick it up since we were ready for dinner and we live only about 2 miles away. The guy on the phone said he would refund my delivery charge of $3 when I get there. I said I'll be there in 5 minutes. He said, "wait we didn't actually cook the pizza yet so it would actually be another 30 minutes until it was ready". Wow, really?! He said we have been swamped. I said nevermind and just process the refund. He said no problem and I should call back in a few days if I don't get the refund. I let him know that was not okay and I wanted an email confirmation of the refund. He said he will ask somebody to do that. I asked to speak to the manager and was told they don't have a manager on duty right now, but the owner is here. I said okay can I speak to the owner. I get put on hold. Well the owner sends the guy back on the phone to tell me that he will email me a confirmation. I was nice to the guy since he was obviously just the messenger. What a horrible experience. Horrible service. No apology. What should have happened was ..... They should have called shortly after the order was placed. They should have prepared the pizza. They should have a back up plan for delivery. Maybe the owner should have delivered the pizza. They should have said sorry. They should have a manger on duty. And most of all the owner of the business should have taken 2 minutes to apologize for the inconvenience and had the common sense to want to speak to one of his/her customers on the phone.

29 degree Sierra Nevada Pale Ale on tap. Delicious burgers. Great service always. Nice patio. Okay amount of tvs for sports. A little pricey outside of happy hour but worth it thanks to the scenery.
