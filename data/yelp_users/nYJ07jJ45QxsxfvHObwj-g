Thanks for the service, or lack thereof. Customer service sucked. Not one person offered to help, and yes, it was slow.

i moved to the tempe area about 2 weeks ago from socal, the mecca for asian restaurants.  since moving out here, my only taste for asian food has been panda express.  well, i was craving teriyaki last night but had no idea where to go so i did a search here.  tokyo house got a bunch of great reviews and everyone mentioned a cool old man behind the counter so i just had to check this place out.  as soon as i walked in the door, i was greeted by the old man...from across the joint, behind the counter, mind you.  he was SUPER nice and SUPER funny!    checked out the menu and the selection was a bit overwhelming!  they have every teriyaki dish available, and bunch of fried rice and noodle choices, and for those that like rabbit food, vegetable dishes.  i was a bit surprised though to not see gyoza or pot stickers on the menu...was bummed out about that.  i had a hard time deciding what to get but remembered Sarah W.'s review of the house chicken, so i went with that.  i went with a large order and let me tell you; if you're hungry, you definitely will be stuffed after a large order.  the dish was very tasty and delicious and was definitely overflowing with mushroom.  i love mushroom!  the house chicken is supposed to be spicy and although it had a little kick, it wasn't the "spicy" i was used to from asian joints in socal.  i wish it had a bit more rice, though.  either way, the dish was great!  i would definitely order it again!  i highly recommend this joint.  you will be treated well by the cool old man behind the counter, the place is clean, the servings are generous and the  price is cheap!

the 1-star rating is based on my one and only visit, so take it w/ a grain of salt.  i ordered the spic basil chicken lunch special which included a choice of white or fried rice (went with white) and soup or salad (went w/ egg drop soup).  egg drop soup was ok but the peas and carrots in the soup were horrible. they just didn't taste real.  the spicy basil chicken was indeed spicy (on a 1-5 spicy scale, i ordered a 3) but did not have a hint of basil in it.  it just tasted horribly.    on a good note (which earned it the 1-star), their thai tea was good.  i wouldn't call this place thai...far from it. most of the food on their menu is chinese.

highly disappointed....not by the quality of the food, but by the accuracy. i ordered spicy fried rice w/ chicken to go. how one would mistaken "noodles" for "fried rice" i have no idea, but for the price, i'd at least expect my order to be accurate. strike 1. fyi, i never give places a chance for strike 3. hope the next time they get my order right.
