I've been coming to Pane for months - usually every weekend (live near by). The boyfriend and I always come for the lunch menu - we love the thick crust pizza.   Only reason it doesn't get a 5 star rating is I HATE chunky tomato sauce. I unfortunately have to remove most of it off. Still gets a 4 star rating because its extremely good food and fresh, fresh, fresh

Best chicken tenders you'll ever have!!  Somewhat of a hole in the wall bar but located on central.

I think every Phoenix resident has been to oreganos. Pizza is good but not amazing. The pizza-cookie is hands down the best dessert ive ever had.   I just dont understand how this place is 24/7 busy with people waiting crazy time periods to sit down. We went at 3:30! today and it was still busy as hell. I gusss its a good problem to have

First time here at this shop. I needed an allignment after visiting discount tire around the corner. For allignments, they recommend a place on northsight along the body/auto shop row.   Anyways, lost the recommendation name and decided to yelp around that area. This shop looked the part with people stating great service and great prices. Done and done.   Made an appointment that day and chandler took care of me like I was a regular. I appreciate that a lot. They got my car done in about 45 minutes - just a simple wheel allignment.   Now the bad part - holy cow $130 for a wheel allignment. Are you kidding me?!? Definitely not reasonable. Of course, i found the discount tire recommendation after I left this place and they cost $60. Just my luck.   Service was good and car is alligned but man oh man, unfortunately I wont be coming back. Wayy too much for allignment. Might want to get competitive with so many other options around you. I'm all for paying for a premium but thats just not right

I should probably own stock in grimaldis - thats how much I visit the place. Best pizza i've ever had in my life and seriously never had a bad pie.   Always make sure to bring my out of towners here and re-visitors always ask to come back.   I'm getting hungry just typing this review haha

Big big ruth's cris fan here. Swear the butter has crack in it to get you back! But unfortunately, dont think I will. Was a regular but the food quality has fallen off or I'm spoiled from City hall.   Came for thanksgiving with the family. My filet was not centered cut which I explained what I wanted from the beginning, lobster mac and cheese wasn't good at all and the 3 course turkey meal wasn't impressed by 2 of my family members. Again, it was decent food but for the price, you can do better  I recommend City hall - regular there now (go almost once a week). Ive never had a bad experience or meal (plus they have buttercake)

Not my first time at bianco but might be my last (go to pane. No wait and better food).   Got there at 8 and luckily, no wait. Surcharge for parking two feet away from the door. Really? Anyways, with the boyfriend and they sat us in the back where there are three SMALL tables for two ppl each. Of course, we get sat right in the middle. I ask the waitress politely if we could have that regular table and she gave me the "resting bitch face" and said um we like to save that for a party of 4. Didnt feel like arguing so just sucked it up.   Food was pretty good. Got two pizzas. Expensive though!!! $15 for a smaller size cheese pizza? Ummm  Grimaldis is so much better

Can't believe I havent given one of my favorite spots a review. Regular here and a big fan!  Came here friday night and was nice and busy (usual in good places lol). High top in the bar was open so we snatched that up.   Service was perfect as always. Attentive but not overly annoying.   We got a pizza, caesar salad and a big ol' plate of french fries (BEST fries in the world...no seriously...) and everything came out perfect  I wish wish wish they wouldnt use chunky sauce on the pizza but other than that, the pizza is fantastic!! Sour dough crust. Sign me up

Well i think i have finally thrown in the towel with dominos and officially with this location.   I dont discriminate with pizza places - i do the local joints, big chains and everything in between.   I eat pizza all the time so this is a painful review to do. More to come on the pizza eater "label"   I ordered a large brooklyn pizza...well done and extra sauce. I always go and pick up my pizzas because i always get a hot and fresh pizza that way.  I stop in, pay for my pizza and get in my car. I opened up the box and i have a raw, sauceless pizza. I bring it back in very politely - one offs happen. No clue if this was the manager but this woman says do u want us to make u a new one or just put this one back in the oven? Did she REALLY just say that? (In my head)Yes i want you to pick the pizza up with your hands and put it back in the oven. Im sure thats gonna turn out GREAT.  The nicest young guy grabs the box and says im going to make this right for you.   Minutes later, a new gentleman comes out with this slight crisp pizza with no sauce and looked like they folded it over twice.   I just shook my head and left. I wasnt going to wait AGAIN for a simple cheese pizza.   I brought it home and tried to cook it in the oven to somehow save this thing but i had a half a piece and threw it out and all of my friends and family know i would NEVER throw out pizza, its a sin.   All in all. I knew what i was getting into with a chain pizza place but come on!

Best dinner I've ever had in phx. Ive been to other mastro's but this one tops them all + every other steak house in the area. Group of 4. Service was excellent - never let our drinks or water even remotely get low.   My filet was AMAZING. The buttercake and chocolate cake for dessert. Holy cow - hands down the greatest thing created. Get it. Its worth it!

First time ever to Chompie's. I feel its the land of the "old waitress". The puffy hair and hairspray almost had me in tears LOL.   Had the pancakes - weak and not even fluffy at all. Two ppl i went with had good meals.   Service sucked, place smelled real bad.

A solid 4 stars. Steak guy here and we've been meaning to try this place  Outside patio connected to the restaurant is so pretty. We sat out there before a table was ready. The view of camelback mtn is very nice.   Restaurant is pretty small which is a-ok in my book. Now the food.   Popover bread. Holy hell - amazing and different. Party of two - i got the filet and he got the strip steak. We also ordered two sides as well. My filet was under cooked so had to send it back. Totally fine - medium is a hard temp to cook. Came back perfect and HOT. NY on the other hand and sides came out rather cold.   We went with the chocolate tart thing for dessert. Was not good at all - should have listened to the waittress on the peanut butter chocolate thing.   Service was great, place is cute. Just may need a tiny bit more detail on the little, little things

Yum yum yum!! Such an underrated spot here in central phx.   Came with a party of 5, sat right down and had very good service - attentive but let us have time to chat!  I always get the pizza here. Its amazing!! Others got burgers and sandwiches and everyone said they were in love.   Will definitely return!!

First timer to Brick. Place is very cute and "urban". Waitress was extremely nice but very new and had no clue what was on the menu or what they had behind the bar. All good though - been there before.   Went with a group of 4. We got wings, artichoke dip and three pizzas and everything was horrid. Pizza had no taste and was burnt. Ingredents lacked very much. Many better places to eat in downtown phx than Brick.

I can't believe I never reviewed our favorite restaurant. Ive ate here well over 50 times in the last few years and have never had a bad meal. No seriously, never.   The pizza is amazing! The dough they use is just...special.   Im obessed with olive oil and they have one of the best i've ever had. One random night, i asked them their brand and of course, they give me a huge container to take home...without asking. Now thats service  Patio is cute as well!

Surprised this location has a much lower rating than the original. This one is for the locals who dont have to wait in line. Definitely try out the downtown one just to "experience" it but nothing is different.   Live almost across the street so we venture here often. They have a really good pie - fresh ingredents, great crust. I just cant give them a full 5 stars based on price. For a thin smaller size pizza, they are a tad bit pricey but hey...least you get good food for your money

Always been a big fan of mellow - best crust on pizza i've ever had but wow the service and "cleanness" of the place was horrible. The entire wait staff were horrible and looked stoned. Place was gross and tables weren't cleaned up properly. Wont be coming back here

My 2nd home. Been a member here for over 6 months.  I've tried every work out or "fad" under the sun but i always burn out from it or become less and less interested in it over time.   Spin, especially here is seriously the best work out because it doesnt "feel" like you are. Oh best believe, the first 10-20 times, you are going to hate life, walk funny and barely be insync with everyone else but once you get the hang of it, it's the greatest. Instructors are awesome, friendly and switch up their routines which is real good (been to other studios where it was the same spin class every time...boring).   Front desk is always friendly and welcoming.

The best of the best. I eat here almost once a week - it's that good!  The OJ - fresh squeezed and always perfect. Wish it wasnt so expensive but you definitely get what you pay for.   I get the waffle everytime. It's literally the greatest waffle this side of the Mississippi (actually its the best one ive ever had but trying to sound slick LOL).   The butter - swear it has crack in it because you will want to put it on everything!!   And now the best part of Matt's (dont laugh!), the sourdough toast. Man ol' man!!!! I swear its better than any sourdough toast from san fran. Amazing!! I get two orders everytime.

First timer at Steak 44. Sat us down right away but had to wait to get a menu - was a tad bit strange. Bread was amazing - nice and warm.  Steak was also amazing - i got the filet and boyfriend got the ribeye. My steak was a tad bit undercooked but the plates were literally hotter than an oven so i just opened it up and let it cook on the plate. No biggie - it happens with "medium" cooked meat.   Waitress was amazing but wait staff was on our ass before we barely finished our food but im sure they are trained like that.   Overall, food was great. Will come back.

Very impressed! Party of 2. Decor is very cute.   I had the pizza - one of the best pies i've ever had. Just light and perfect blend of cheese and sauce  We also got the filet and was perfection.  We are definitely coming back again. Service was great as well!!

My go-to for lunch.  I visit this location 1-2 times a week for their lunch (2 big slices and a drink under $5. Cant beat it)  The front desk girls are awesome and always friendly with me - nice they always remember my order haha.   I sometimes order out the breadsticks with cheese - amazing as well.

Very impressed! Nothing better than a hot donut!  I'm a chocolate glazed donut fan!! They had them and they were very good! Wouldnt say GREAT just because i like the white glaze and they weren't very chocolatey (LOL) but I will definitely be back for more of these.   Had a bite of the french toast one. Wowzers, very good

Been meaning to try this place for awhile - love a good pizza place and heard good things  Entered the place through the gate - place is very cute. Definitely modern and "hip".   Im a BIG pizza fan and this was probably the strangest pizza i've ever had. The best way to describe it was...the pizza was "wet". Not greasy because i love some greasy pizza but the ingredents and top of it was wet. Just wasnt impressed at all.   Like others, we waited for SO long for the bill. I'm all good for not being rushed and i was with good company that we could chat all night but 30+ minutes was redic. Plus never got offered a refill or water filled up.   Probably wont come back. Hope they do well. I love a local spot in the neighborhood

Came with a party of 4 for brunch. 2 of us tapped the bloody mary bar. Both of the parties' drink looked real good and pretty impressive.   I ordered the Oreo cookie pancakes. Holy shit. These were so good - like eating chocolate cake. Everyone else said their meal was amazing to "good".  Didnt give it a perfect 5 star rating because they dont have fresh squeezed OJ and no sour dough toast. I know im nit picking. It's a great spot and cant wait to return

Been coming to portillos for awhile but the one in scottsdale. Was in tempe and was craving a chocolate cake shake and some good food    What happened to this place? Hot dog was tasteless even with every topping possible on it. I always get a chocolate cake shake - lightly mixed at the scottsdale location and in chicago. I asked for that and got the blank stare. Had to explain what it was to the worker (fml).  Got it and of course, was completely blended like normal. Went up to the front and asked them to redo it, very nicely. Got a rude manager basically looking down on me about it and got a terrible replacement. Didnt eat anything and threw it away and walked.  Never coming back here

Awesome spot. Like all the other reviews - u feel like you are "family" there. Went with two other friends of mine and we all had a great time.   Our server (male brother. Forgot his name) is hilarious and was really personable from the start. We did two pizzas and a salad and we all left full but not food coma full.   Pizza was very good, service was excellent. Definitely coming back

Addicted to pizza so whenever a new joint comes into town, i got to try it.  Its the fast pie type place - build it in front of you and they make it real fast.  Loved how they have two types of crust - I had the pan (thicker). Crust was great!  I'm a boring ol' cheese pizza guy and I was impressed. Sauce was good, cheese tasted good. They put wayyyy too much sauce on the pie - i'll ask for light sauce this next time.   The dessert looked good as well but passed on it this time

Came here with a party of 5 on saturday. Heard great reviews and the fam LOVES seafood so we took a dip in the new restaurant pond.   It was someone's bday and i was the first to arrive. I asked if they had a candle or something we could blow out for a dessert...the response "um no we dont. We keep getting asked if we do" and a long pause. Um ok?   It was slow due to a holiday so the waitress was on our ass alllll night and not giving us a lot of time to chat at the table. She was super nice but hit the brake a bit hunny.   Now the food! The pull apart bread was AMAZING. So good that we got another order of it.  Friends got blue point oysters and said they were amazing! Calamari was on point as well! Im a steak guy so i ordered the NY steak. Very good and flavorful. It does come out cut which im not used to but it was fine. Very prime piece of meat - hardly any fat.  We got the chocolate cake for dessert. Very good but its extremely thick and not very moist (its really good though!)  Overall, the place is great. Looks good inside and the food was fantastic.  Wish they did reservations - it will come to bite them in the ass

Love deep dish pizza!! When my co worker (from chicago) had a countdown going for months for this place to open, i knew i had to get here as well  Tried this place opening weekend. Yes it was extremely busy but all good. Knew what we were in for. Their waiting system and texting app is awesome and gives you a countdown for your table.   Im a cheese pizza guy (boring right?). Got the buttercrust as well.   Only reason why im giving this place 4 stars (more like 4 1/2) is i wish it had a layer of sauce under the cheese. I've had dozens of other deep dish pizza and they always have a layer of it under. Reason for that is i HATE chunky tomatoes and i always take the first layer off (I know you have to have it on top for it to cook right). Just wish for the layer under  Will definitely return

No clue why the bad ratings from everyone else. We had a great lunch!  Place is beautiful inside. I love the oversized furniture and finishes. Service was amazing! Everyone had a smile on their face, waitress was great as well. Attentive and prompt.   Food was very good!  We'll def be back
