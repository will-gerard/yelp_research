I just LOVE this place. The food is really good for cheap Japanese food. Much better than the other place across the street. The gentleman that is always at the counter is very very nice. If I want cheap Japanese, this is the place to go.

What should I call this review? Can I give this half a star?   "Bada Boo!" or "Bada Doom"   I went to Bada Boom Pasta Room in Scottsdale Saturday Night to celebrate a friend's birthday with 11 people. All other restaurants were booked in the area that night so this place was the last resort. The organizer of the birthday bash had called earlier in the week to make reservations and was told that there was a comedy event on the patio. "No problem" they said, "we can accommodate you". Half the party was already seated at the table when I and another friend walked in at 8:30. The waiter was there taking drink orders when we walked in. (They were seated at 8:00). Drinks showed up around 9:00. A staff member came and said that our server was overwhelmed and that he was going to take over for us. (It was her third day). Food orders were taken around 9:15. I asked the waiter what the soup of the day was and he said that they were out of pizza. I was going to order pizza. I had to ask him a second time what the soup was. He then finally informed me that there was no soup. Well finally orders were taken from everyone. FIVE rolls were brought out for 11 people. ROLLS at an Italian restaurant?? I was expecting garlic bread. So everyone did not get bread. We asked for more and then we were brought what now looked like 30 rolls 10 minutes later. As we were waiting for our food, I could see the food prep area where a man was preparing dough for pizza! I though they were OUT of pizza. What the heck was that I could see? Food came out around 9:30 . Some people got their food. One person did not have their food prepared as requested. She is allergic to something that she asked be removed from the food. My food was brought to me. The server called it "tricolor tortellini". I recall ordering "tortellini di mari" That was the exact name on the menu. Everyone was eating their food so I went to the restroom. I was hoping that my food would be out when I returned. It did not. We later asked the manager to remove it from the bill along with the other mess ups that night. He argued with me that my food was brought out twice and that I would not take it. Here is my point about my order: If you call it something on the menu then you must call it that same name when you bring out to the customer. Since we asked that my food be removed from the bill the manager left. He never came back. Instead, he was standing out from watching a charity performance on the patio. WTF!! We were left at the table trying to decide if we pay for the bill or ditch. Bada Boo! needs to rethink their ability to accommodate a large charity event and general diners. It appears that they cannot juggle more than 2 balls at one time. A staff member said that it was not good since they were missing a bartender, out of pizza out of soup, and short on staff. I am pretty sure most of the people attending the charity event got EVERYTHING that they needed. Bada Doom! get your act straight on your operating procedures. Oh, and also they menu was very limited and the food was bland. I am NEVER going back there again, even though the manager invited us back for free drinks.

Yummmmmy! This was really good. I had the fresh spring rolls which tasted great. I just wish that they didn't cut them into pieces. I had the Sizzling beef which had a really good savory taste. I wish I had more room in my tummy for more food. I will definitely go back.

My husband and I almost always go here when the craving for sushi and sashimi hits. Yesterday, we brought my parents for dinner. As always, we ordered a sashimi platter which had crab legs and whole shrimp along with the usual fish and garnishes. We also ordered 3 rolls on the happy hour menu. The rolls came out at different times because they come out as they are prepared. Someone had commented on a previous Yelp review that their rolls came out at different times. Of course they do, they can't sit and wait on the counter while the others are being made! Anyway, everything was excellent as usual. We will come back when the craving hits again.

I called this place at 12:15 am to ask what time the kitchen stopped serving. The person who answered put me on hold and said she would find out. She said the stop at 12:45am. We got there at 12:25. As we were sitting, a staff member walked by. I have her eye contact twice while she was talking to a close by table. By 12:29, someone finally came to us and said that last call for food was at 12:30. Then the bartender yells "last call."  My gripe is that after I was told on the phone that kitchen closed at 12:45 & we would get served if we got there before then. We were ignored until 12:30 in a very slow place. The server offered to ask her manager if they can serve us. Too late! I want to give this place a chance but they didn't give us a chance.

I am so glad there is a snow place in Chandler. The store is very clean. The snow is yummy. I had the mango snow with mochi, captain crunch, & strawberries. Husband had the vanilla avalanche or whatever it's called. We will come back to try the others.

I'm posting this review to help Nishikawa out so they can ready for their grand opening. This is not in anyway going to be riddled with profanity and judgement like another poster but something constructive and helpful to the staff. For the record, I have worked in the service industry through high school, college, and now as a Registered Nurse.   Husband and I came on Monday around 1pm. We had to wait about 5 minutes to be seated. There were 8-4 tops and 12 seats at the bar. No one seated at the bar, 2-4 tops open. We were given the menus which were abbreviated versions of the one online. The one online was still a work in progress with template instructions still there. So we were given water without is ordering which was great. It was 100pm by the time we started to order. We ordered takoyaki first. By 109pm we were told that they stopped serving ramen after "a certain time." The time wasn't really sure by our server. So we ordered the rest of our food. My husband ordered the karaage donburi and I ordered the chicken chashu donburi. We could hear the servers tell other patrons being told that they didn't have ramen anymore. There was some guy who was seated at the bar way after we arrived that somehow got ramen. A dish came out that looked like our takoyaki but the server said it was something else so we passed it along to the other table only to have it brought back to us as takoyaki. Yes, it was takoyaki. My husband liked it. Then his bowl came out. I had to wait for my bowl long enough to sit and stare at his food, go to the bathroom, do my thing, go back to table and watch one server bring 2 bowls to another table. Still had to wait another few minutes for my bowl. Finally got it. The meat was warm, not hot. It was pretty fatty. I was thinking this was not right. Gave a piece to my husband. It was pork. I don't eat pork belly a lot. Appetite gone. At least, the rice was hot. Anyone with religious, allergies or adversions to pork with a temper probably would have thrown a huge stink. I'm not the temper tantrum type even after the strike outs so far. One server came to see how things were. I told her that I believe that I was given pork rather than chicken. She asked if I was told that they ran out of chicken. No, we were not. They did give us a free drink of green tea (matcha not tea bags) for not having ramen. With a lost appetite, I asked for a box since I wasn't going to finish my bowl. It was already after 2pm and people were still trying to come in that were turned away. The servers and the manager/owner? ended up locking the front door. We paid our bill and tried to leave. Nope, staff can't get the front door open, we left through the side door. The thought went through my head that we would have to go through the kitchen.   So right now, I hope that Nishikawa will read these reviews and make some positive changes. The owners should consider allowing their servers to write down their orders so there is no confusing tables. The sign by the front door should say they ran out of ramen and other things. People should be told that they ran out or stopped serving ramen before being seated. Other Yelpers were offered giftcards to come back. We were not, so the incentive is very low right now. We will give it 3-6 months before going back. By then, the kinks will hopefully be worked out. I look forward to trying you again.
