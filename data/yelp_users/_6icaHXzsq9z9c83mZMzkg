This place has the best vegetarian sushi roll in town as well as overall good food. Service alters from unbelievably excellent to non-existent.

Not much in the way of culinary excellence in Sun City West. This particular Applebee's not only had microwaved crappy food but made me sick. Stay away.

In a city of sprawling suburbs, strip malls and chain everything, the Downtown Phoenix Market is a chance to meet local people who are putting their hearts, time and money into creating a community.   What to expect: several produce vendors selling their wares grown locally using sustainable methods; small business owners selling breads and pastries, delicious salsas, canned goods, tabouli and hummus; artists and crafts people selling jewelry, aprons, bags, clothing and lots more. It is really a fantastic place.  In addition to their regular hours of 8-12 on Saturday morning, the market is now open on Wednesdays from 4-8pm and they will be expanding in 2008 into the building next to the lot where they are currently located. Check it out!

I like this place even if it's a chain. It is pricey (or at least more pricey than the other guys) but the pizza is great with topping options you can't get anywhere else (sun dried tomatoes, ricotta cheese, capers, etc).
