Pulled pork and coleslaw was AWESOME!  Corn on the cob was terrible.  Sauce for dipping pork was tasty!  Pretty rude guy behind the counter... SUCKED...  He looked like he wanted to punch someone out!  He didn't really say anything rude, but I deffinetly felt like I was WASTING his time.  I will go back for sure.  They are about to update the table tops! ;o)

I was really excited to see this place being from Detroit.  It's like a mom and pop back east!  The food was great!  Loved the food selections.  Waitress was a nice lady.  All the stuff behind the deli counter looked delish!  I will come back for bagels next time my work has an event.  They looked really good!  I had the pastrami, coleslaw and a pickle.  Sooo good!  Not super salty like cheap pastrami!  Go here!

This is my favorite sushi spot.  The price is right, the staff is friendly, the sushi is pretty darn good and the ambiance is nice and cozy.  Great for a date, or even just lunch.  I can walk out full and sakied up for 20 bucks!

Choice of dogs.  Hot dogs have the skin casing which I love.  Onion rings were great.  Quick, Cheap (two dogs for under 6 bucks out the door)  It was exactly what I was looking for.  Fast, yummy, fair priced lunch.

Delish!  This is the third time I've gone through the drive through!  The portions are BIG!  The food is pretty authentic tasting to me!  Best after bar food!  24 hrs too!  I had the bacon breakfast burrito today.   So much chunkey bacon and cheese!  Oh, and the Green Chili is pretty darn good too.

For what this place is I loved it!  It's a small privately owned mexican restaurant.  The owner was there.  The staff is SUPER nice and quick.  They even have a guy dedicated to pouring out delicious salsa!  The food was great and I couldn't finish it.  I like the loud ambiance, and the maragritas are cheap and yummy!  will go back!  Everyone seem to order the taco salads.  I loved my machaca chix burrito..  Small, friendly, quaint, quick, reasonably priced and yummy!

I was looking for some cheap spring rolls and I am a happy girl.  I ordered carry out.  Phone service was rude, no total, no name  lol...  Food was ready in less than 10 minutes.  After looking at the picts on YELP I ordered the pork spring rolls and Veggies with large rice noodles.  I paid less than $8 for both out the door.  Carry out came with cutlery and sauces (YEAH)!  Food was pretty darn good.  The gravy on the Veggies and noodles was a bit greasy for me, but tasted GREAT!  I will go back again.  Oh, there wasn't a gringo in the place at lunch time.

I was looking for a smaller scale family vet and met with Dr Adkins.  Nice quirky kinda guy.  Straight shooter and down to earth.  He answered all my questions without me feeling like I was a bother.  (I liked that!)  In my opionion some Doctors treat the general public like morons or aids patients.  I didn't get ther weirdo vibe from Dr Adkins.  As for my last vet, I couldn't say the same.  Vet tech was REALLY nice.  Front of house lady seemed kinda fake, but was nice enough.  I had a bit of a wait due to two pet emergencies.  The doc even appologized for the wait.  I like the humility.  I totally understand, if my dog was severly sick or hit by a car, I would hope for the same treatment.  I'm very happy to have found a new vet.

I was driving by and decided to stop in for a quick happy hour dinner. Service was typical college girls (um... like duh...) Ambiance is nice, besides the fact that I was surrounded by less then average intelligence college kids. Sushi SUCKED. I ordered the spider roll (really bad), Alaska (tasteless) and a glass of house Chardonnay. If it were not for the ok wine and ambiance, this place would have received 1 star. Oh, and the parking sucks too. The spots were pretty small, I was totally expecting a ding on my door. Thank goodness I beat both lot neighbors out.

Roaches abound everwhere!!!!  I walk my dog at night and can't stand the roaches chaseing me and my pup at night.  I know we live in AZ, but Steel Park on Indian School doesn't have an infestation.  It kinda smells and on the weekends the croud kinda scares me.  I'm done going to this park  I rather walk the dog in the surrounding neighborhoods.

I read the good reviews on this place and it's near mi casa so I decided to give it a try.  It was so good I was back two days later.  The staff is very nice.  The reviews from the health inspector are up and they are good!  I had a nice amount of delicious food for the price.  I ordered the spicy chicken dumplins, Vegetable lo mein and finally vegetable chow fun with soft tofu.    Ambiance is chinese greasy spoon, but looked clean.  EAT HERE!

Sour Dough Bread Boule with Cream Cheese Potato Soup!  Yumm Yum!  I love the fact that this unit is NOT at a mall.  It is accross the street from a upscale strip mall.  Food was Great (but they burnt my friends bread boule.)  Service was excellent.  Young men and women working, but super nice and accomidating.  I asked for three soup samples and they were busy!  (They had three registers a ringing.)  Great people watching.  I saw an old cougar, a wicked (plastic surgry nightmare) stepmom, and a few other interesting people.    The  breadboule was cheap.  Under six bucks.

Walking in I had a big whif of mold.  Staff NICE, food pretty darn good.  We had appetizers.  Drinks we good.  Nice happy hour specials.  We played trivia.  Nice crowd of people.  A mix, not just college kids.  Bar was fun, not too loud and tables were only slightly sticky.  I will definitely go back!

Beautiful!! Close to Downtown!!  Be sure to bring cash!  When we went there, there was no one at front gate.  You are to deposit 10 bucks cash in envelope.  You can be fined if you do not.  There are picnic spots and restrooms!!!  NICE

I can honestly say this was the worst meal I have had in a LONG time.  I'll just give you the highlights.  Ambiance, looks like a construction zone, waitress/bartender, very nice but totally understaffed food wait, WAY too long I actually wish I took a picture of the fries.  They were BLACK!  lol once they go black, we tried to send em back  lol... She was to busy to even check on us.   The four us us agreed we would never go back.   This was our 2nd Friday dinner choice... Should of gone for the Mesa Grill. This morning my stomach was cramping pretty hard. WARNING, AVOID THIS PLACE!

I support local business!  The staff are A+.  Ambiance is bright and open with cool old brick walls, high ceilings and local art.  I ordered the Queen Sandwich (their take on a Caprese) and it was delicious.  The Pizza is offered in slices or by the pie.  Thin and large, they are great as long as the staff does not over heat them.  The BBQ Chicken Sandwich was not so good and they forgot my requested cheese.  Timing on food could use a bit of work.  My friend gets slices and I get a sub 5 minutes after their food.  It's just kinda a pet peeve of mine.  Bathrooms are clean, parking in back, free refills and I feel appreciated as a customer when I'm there.  I like it for lunch to people watch off of Main.

Food great, pricing a bit high with so much competition for ghetto mex I was expecting.  Food good, ambiance nice, service GREAT!  I guess the deal is the quality is better, thus the higher price.  I personally would go back if they had a bit better pricing.

I had the smoked salmon on a egg white omelet.  Staff nice, ambiance fantastic, easy parking, prices comparable to downtown Scottsdale.  My drink was kinda week, but I would return for sure.

Got the veggie pho.  Broth, veggies and noodles were great.  Prices were good too.  My friend and I were the only gringos in the place.  Will go back!  Cruddy ambiance, but we went for lunch... not for a date ;o)  My friend loved her food too.  She had the beef with eggrolls.  MMMM  Great place to experience Pho for the first time.  Everything comes with a description on the menu ;o)  No alcohol..

Food was awesome!  Prices were even better,.  Salmon skin roll was the best I've had.  Wait staff SUCKS!  Cute college girls that are DUMB!  Don't bother asking any questions.  When I go back, I'll sit at the sushi bar!!  The place is small and quaint.  Clean..  I saw a couple get up and leave due to no service.

I'm new to the area and I was looking for cheap, close, not Panda Express Chinese food.  I was there on Sunday for lunch.  I was able to order off of the lunch menu :o) and for the awesome price I got great tasty food.  The egg drop was better than most places.  (no funky veggies like corn or carrots), spring roll -  nothing special, chop suey mmmmm.  I'm happy to have my new local carry out joint!

I have a potato, egg and cheese burrito here at least once a week.  It is soooo yummy!  It tastes better than Filibertos and Eribertos.  It's bigger too!  The staff is really friendly.  I haven't had a bad experience yet.  If you use CC they charge you $.50.   If you go inside they have the typical salsa bar.  Carrots are really crunchy. mmm

I am in love with their menu.  I can go out to eat with many healthy delicious options.  The owner asked my friend and I twice how everything was.  Food great, service great, we had a groupon and I will go back again even without one!  They serve wine and beer and my cab was good! Great place for lunch or if you have a health conscious date.  I can even bring my meat and potato eating boyfriend here without too much squaking.  Great ambiance and the bathrooms are clean!

I came here for authentic eastern European food.  I was very happy with my selections and the front counter lady was very nice.  I purchased the lunch pierogi plate and the pork stuffed cabbage.  Fantastic...  I loved the sauerkraut and farmers cheese pierogi....  I even bought a bag of cheese to go!  Divey, order and pay at counter...  Very happy customer.. oh.  and my brother picked up some Russian Pickles and Pickled Cabbage.  The pickles are great, and I will have to make some stuffed cabbage out of the pickled stuff..

I've had the chicken quesadilla, taco and carne asada burrito.  All are fantastic.  Staff is very friendly.  The facilities are clean.  Most importantly, I feel safe eating their food.  Last month I got food poisoning from a local ghetto Mex restaurant.  Eat here!

This place is Fantastic!  The empinadas are perfect and not oily or dry.  The Pernil is my favorite along with the Posole.  They serve beer and wine and are working on getting their liquor licence.   The lunch special is filling and delicious.  Or try the Posole for your lunch.  A great way to go.  The place has a great vibe, the staff are friendly and nice and the bathrooms are always clean!    I like supporting small business, and this is a win win!
