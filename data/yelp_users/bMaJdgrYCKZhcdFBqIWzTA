The moment I walked in I got hit with a whiff of flavor and got a flashback of my server days at Johnny Rockets. I saw the menu and knew I had to try it all. The stand burger was delicious and the tacos were unbelievably good. The fries were good but this place is differently a place you go for a taco or burger.  The elotes were not up to my par but the guacamole was good. The atmosphere and aesthetics of the place were on fleek.  Definitely a place I am coming back to.

The burgers were good. Nothing spectacular. The chili cheese fries were good but nothing spectacular. The banana milkshake was on fleek doe

I have had good service in the past but today was horrible. I constantly go in and have never been asked for id and it is the same guy every time. When I said that was surprising he said they "do it all the time" which is completely false. Then when I told him he was lying and that I just came in yesterday, which I did, and he has never done it, he said I probably wasn't helped by him. Then I told him once again he was wrong, I even pointed out the monster logo tattoo concealed behind his ear. Then he said, "you know I can refuse service if you are persistent." So I started walking out and he goes "I was just joking." If they give you trouble at all leave and go somewhere else. There are a plethora of shops that are equal if not better in quality. Teach them to talk to customers with at least the same respect you give them. I was a frequent client and my friends as well and I do not think we will be back. You lost a large clientele and I will be spreading the news.
