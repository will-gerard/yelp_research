LOVE THIS PLACE! The green corn tamales are the best I have ever had, the salsa is authentic and bursting with flavor, and the staff interact like family. Very warm and friendly atmosphere. Great place to get your margarita on ;)

This place has drastically deteriorated. LITERALLY the tiniest rolls I have EVER seen. Precisely the size of a hot dog cut in 5 pieces. I ordered 7 rolls and 2 appetizers for three people and I am leaving hungry. When I mentioned the questionable size the waitress, who was nice but seemed new, she was told it was because they used less rice. The las vegas roll was the size of a regular roll and the regular rolls looked "cute" Price is the same as most  but definitely do not get your money's worth. Not a recommendation and the last time I ever come here after 3 years of patronage

Dave is THE BEST. I met him at the Circle K down the road from his shop when I had locked my keys in my truck. He had come to compliment me on "Ole Yeller" and when he realized the predicament I was in went well out of his way to go back to the shop and get tools to come help me unlock it. Since then I have been there more than a few times and every time more than happy with his workmanship and his service. It's not often you find somebody that's honest in this industry and when you do you hold on to them. I recommend a van at apex 2 any and all Arizonans.
