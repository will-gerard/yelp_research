Roberts Catering is amazing! I was married last weekend and hired Roberts.   I was referred to Roberts from Davids Bridal for the cake but ended up hiring them to cater the entire reception. It was a small reception in our backyard for 25 people but it felt like fine dining! The staff of two phenomenal ladies set up the buffet beautifully!! They spoiled us from the start and made sure we were taken care of. They conversed with guests and made everyone feel welcome.   The food was so good from the stuffed mushrooms and meatballs to the carved beef and hunters chicken.   I can see why some of the comments were made about Wendy because they don't realize how much she knows! Once you understand that she speaks from experience and wants to make your day special you know you are in good hands! She told us from the beginning that we wouldn't have to worry about a thing and we didn't. Trust Wendy she knows what she is doing.  Now for the best part... the cake was amazing! We went to a tasting and were sold from first bite. Our wedding cake was even better. It looked just like I wanted and tasted amazing.   You will not disappointed with Roberts. I will definitely use them again. My wedding was amazing and beautiful and Roberts had a huge part of that!

I have been here multiple times although mostly for takeout. The rolls are awesome.  Never have to wait long for my order.  I like that they have gluten free soy sauce but the price per packet seems a little high.   Good quality food and portions.

I literally just walked out of that store and will never go back. I am new to shooting and want to get a gun for my personal protection. I walked in with my husband and no one said a word. We were looking to purchase a Sig and received no attention. I understand that they may be busy but it takes a second to say "I'll be right with you" or even "hello". Very rude and undeserving of my business.

Wow! So impressed that Alex came at 8:00pm to replace our water valves. We recently moved in a house and have been a week without a washer and dryer. They get delivered and installed only to find the valves are leaking and need to be replaced. Alexanders plumbing was able to squeeze us in at the end of the night to fix them.   On top of all that, the work was impeccable and did not required any patching. Most plumbers leave a mess but he made it look even better.   Do not hesitate to give Alex a call! Awesome! Thank you!  FYI -  prices were on par with other quotes.

What a great store and experience purchasing my first gun. Logan did a great job explaining the features and differences. I was able to try a few and they discounted the range fees on my purchase. The range is very nice and it felt secure. I will definitely go back. Thank you!

Just left the range and have to give kudos to Andrew. He was the range master while my husband and I were shooting and he is awesome! He gave us tips on our grip and aim that helped immensely! Thanks Andrew!
