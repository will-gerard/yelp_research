I got takeout for an event to feed about 60 people, very easy process, helpful staff, great pricing, and delicious food. I am a very satisfied customer

Worst service ever. In a group of 6 the first person to order received her food long after the rest of us. And the order was wrong.

Delicious, inexpensive and friendly. The restaurant is cozy and always full. Since I discovered it a few months ago this also is my favorite takeout place.

Driving from Tucson to Mesa we found this place on Yelp and stopped for lunch. There was a wait but it was worth it. Great service from Ursula, cozy atmosphere and yummy food. it was a challenge to choose one thing from the menu because everything looked good. We will be back!

We wanted to try a new place and ordered delivery. Yummy & reasonably priced, friendly staff. High quality ingredients, pepperoni sliced thin but large pieces, I usually don't eat the crust and I ate every bite. We will be ordering again!

Great reviews from others led us here for lunch on a Sunday. They've only been open a couple of months, and have Daily lunch buffet (not just weekdays). We have tried a couple of other Indian buffets in Phoenix and were not terribly impressed by the food. My meal today was Ridiculously Delicious, prices inexpensive and service was outstanding. We will be back and bring friends!

I echo what Leslie said in her review. I'm so excited that I found this place! Been coming here for a few months for pedicures. So far I have only seen Nina who does such a great job that I always ask for her. I have ingrown toenails which need some TLC, and they get it. She is thorough, patient and very sweet. I never feel rushed and am always happy I came.
