NO!  The only good dim sum in town, however, yesterday we went and there was a sign on the door that the landlord had shut them down and changed the locks for failure to pay rent.

I ordered a rare beef pho with added beef balls. The beef was chewy and the beef ball had an off-putting flavor and an odd texture. All could be forgiven though based on the broth.  Interestingly. when I first tasted the broth I felt it was ok. It didn't have the depth of the best of broths it town, but it had a flavor that was pleasant at first. I thought was better than some of the bland offerings around the valley. However, by the end of the meal, I would have preferred one of the more bland offerings. Imagine listening to the same musical note over, and over, and over, and over again. Silence is much better. That was how I felt about this broth. The same darn note over and over again. I did what I never do and started doctoring the bowl with sriracha, hoisin, salt, and by the end I even tried sugar.  On a side note, I had the spring rolls which were the worst I've had in town. The spring roll itself was flavorless and the sauce literally tasted like melted Skippy peanut butter, While I enjoy melted peanut butter on a toasted bagel, it's not exactly what you want as a complement in your Asian meal.

Google mediocre and I imagine Smashburger will pop up.  Overcooked tasteless burgers.  Dried out chicken breasts.  Soggy flavorless fries.  The only thing we had worth ordering was the Nutter Butter shake.  The shake wasn't enough to save it from the 1 star rating.  Might be the worst restaurant burger I have ever had.

Brisket and ribs, brisket and ribs, brisket and ribs.  Did I say brisket and ribs?       As a certified BBQ judge, I am very picky about my BBQ.  That having been said, I have traveled 20 minutes each way many, many times to eat here.  As you might guess my favorites here are the brisket and ribs.  Both have a very nice texture with enough smoke flavor to make any BBQ fan happy.  For the sides I will normally get the mac & cheese and the sweet potato fries.  Both are real palate pleasers.

Tried going there for my 1st visit and they were closed during hours they were supposed to be open.  Have tried calling them a few times during normal business hours and did not get anyone to pickup.  They may be closed for good.  Not sure.

Wow!  What a pleasant surprise!  As a KCBS certified BBQ judge, I am very picky about my BBQ.  Campfire Bistro has it figured out.  This place is a must.  Just opened @ Tom Thumb's gas station @ 9393 E. Bell Road in Scottsdale.  Haven't even had their grand opening yet (weekend of 4/28-4/29).  Got the 2 meat platter of with pork and brisket.  Both were perfectly tender and a nice punch of smoke flavor.  For the side I had the shoestring fries.  Warning: They are highly addictive.  They have a counter with a wide variety of sauces.  I didn't put any on the meat because when the meat is that good, sauce can only ruin it in my mind.  However, I did use them to dip the fries in and they really had some interesting unique flavors.  Try the Low Country, the Texas, and regular sauces.  TWO HUGE THUMBS UP HERE!

Finally, "REAL" Texas BBQ has come to the Valley.  As a certified BBQ judge with KCBS I am very particular about my BBQ.  This is the must stop place!  Do not leave without ordering the brisket.  The brisket was moist with bark that was packed with flavor and just the right amount of smoke.  No sauce needed!  Ribs are the best in town.  Can't wait to get back to do the beef ribs on a Friday or Saturday, but if they are anything like the ones they served down at the Farmer's Market, it will be my favorite of the bunch.

As a certified KCBS BBQ judge, I always rush to try a new BBQ restaurant when I hear good things.  Well, some top notch BBQ just hit the west valley.  The owner's name is Oren and he has a real passion for BBQ.  He is only open weekdays at 11:00 am until the meat is gone.  I had a little taste of everything and I can say without hesitation that all of meats are worth ordering.  I was fortunate to show up on a Tuesday and had a taste of the Tuesday special tri-tip which was probably my favorite of all of the offerings.  The turkey and chicken were both spot on.  Ribs and pulled pork were both among the best in the valley.  The brisket was fantastic and the sausage was very tasty.  It is hard to believe it's only been open 5 days.  Oren is still tinkering with some of the flavor profiles so I can only imagine what heights he might reach as he continues to perfect his craft.

A Mother's Day disaster.  As a big fan of Grassroots Tap & Kitchen I was excited to take my mother, wife, and two kids to try out it's new sister restaurant Twisted Grove for Mother's Day.  This is no Grassroots Tap.  At best maybe an evil step-sister.  Nothing came out hot or even warm.  Everything we ordered ranged from room temperature to downright cold when it hit the table.  That is what made it to the table as not everything we ordered actually arrived.  Despite our dinner we WERE going to order some dessert to celebrate the holiday.  That never happened as the bill arrived and was dropped on the table without asking whether or not we wanted dessert or how our we liked the dinner.  This place has a lot of work ahead of it to be acceptable.  No thanks.

Finally good seafood has returned to the valley.  Been there twice and and both times the food has been a knockout.  The off the dock menu I had a grilled halibut with the house blend spice rub.  The halibut was cooked to perfection, flaky and moist.  I need to find out how to get a jar of that spice rub.  Super tasty.  On the side I recommend the lobster bisque (very generous chunks of the lobster in the soup) and the grilled asparagus.  From the appetizer I highly recommend the bacon wrapped shrimp and the lobster mac and cheese (once again, overly generous with huge pieces of lobster).  Warning: the rice crispy treat from the dessert menu is highly addictive.
