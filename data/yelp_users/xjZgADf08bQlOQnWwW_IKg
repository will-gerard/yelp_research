4.5 stars.  On several recommendations since we came to town we decided to try this place.  I can definately see what all the hype is about!    My buddy and I ordered two sandwiches and split them, the cappicola and the pastrami.  They were great.  I preferred the pastrami slightly over the other but they were both great.  The waitress said the best way to eat them is to put hot sauce right on the slaw.  Great recommendation.  The bread was bulky but soft and held up nicely to the last bite.  The slaw that they used was great and like nothing I've had before.  It was vinegar based but not too strong.    It was a cool atmosphere and they had an outdoor seating area.  The staff was fun and energetic.  Great late night food after a night of drinking.  I would definately recommend this place to a friend.

This place was a life saver more than once during my stay in Pittsburg.  They are open 24/7 which is amazingly convinient.  They staff was vey helpful and willing to engage in conversation about places to eat or where to buy booze.    Their prices were fair and they had a large selection.  Late one night we stopped in to buy a snack and I really needed to use the bathroom.  They didn't have one but she told the employee of the upstairs business to let me use the bathroom.  That was great.    I imagine I will be back before my trip is over.

This place is huge!  I love the amazing views of the river.  Everything is clean and there are many employees constantly walking around picking up trash and keeping things clean in general.    It is strange that there are so few bathrooms.  Many times the bathroom was full because there are only a couple stalls.    We didn't have to park so I'm not sure about any of that.  Overall it was a good venue.

We had a little stay-cation here during the summer and it was great. I'm sure during the busy season the room rate would be out of our price range but during the summer we only paid $82 a night.   The room was large and clean.  It had a rear patio with chairs.  They even gave us and our relatives adjoining rooms.  I was pleasantly surprised by the size and quality if the room and bathroom.    We had to pay the $22 per night resort fee which was worth it as we enjoyed the pool and bocce courts.  I will say that with a $22 per room, per night charge they could keep the bocce courts and cornhole set ups in a little better condition.  Besides that, the grounds were clean and well manicured.  The pool area was a blast.  They had a water slide for kids and a bunch of lounge chairs setup all around the pool.  They didn't have enough umbrellas for all the stands they had which seemed rediculous especially in AZ in the summer heat.    They had servers in the pool area that would bring food and drinks upon request.  They were organized and attentive.    We had a blast and will be returning for sure.

This place is great! The service was very friendly and everyone is working hard.  I love the chicken kabob with a small greek salad.  The salad is perfectly dressed.   The chicken is quality white meat breast seasoned great with awesome flame grilled flavor.    They do a great job of keeping the place clean and visiting the tables to ensure your meal is correct.  I will definately be back.

Hit this place up for a quick lunch.  I took my order to go.  The place was clean and bright.  It had a great small business deli/market feel.  Everyone was friendly.  I ordered the 10" sub sandwich on white bread.  The bread was great, soft but substantial with great flavor.  The meats were quality and the provolone had great bite.  Seems hard to find a good flavorful provolone anymore, theirs was great and a nice thick slice.  They added a good balance of oil/vinegar, tomato, red onion, lettuce and oregano.  Great sandwich!  I couldn't get out if there without ordering a canoli.  I ordered the regular.  At $2.99, they aren't cheap but worth it.  The filling is made with a hefty dose of vanilla, which I love.  Just the right amount of chocolate chips.  The shell was crispy but not too thick and I could really taste the cinnamon.    All in all, like the previous reviewer...."this place is legit".  I will be back for sure!

I love the sandwiches at this place!  I also live their great variety of beers and other alcoholic beverages.    The two ladies behind the counter are obviously the old school neighborhood type which is pefeect for this part of tiwn.  They definitely liked being asked about thier most popular sanwiches and obviously warmed up when we engaged them in conversation.    The sandwiches were definately worth the wait! They were amazing! The blazing buffalo was awesome and a friend got the triple t which was also great!  The bread was nice and soft and all the toppings were fresh.  Great food!  I will be eating here again.

I've been eating here for several years.  The food is always consistent and quality.  The salsa is fresh and they have several choices.  Their beans are great even though they don't use any lard, the same for the tortillas.  They offer wheat tortillas as a healthier option which actually are good.  I have had several dishes off their menu and have never had anything I didn't like.  I would definitely recommend the mexican pizza.  Its a lot of food and can be split between two adults.  If you are looking for a healthier option, the salpicon salad is awesome.   I prefer it with shredded beef. It comes served over a tostada shell smeared with beans, romaine lettuce, cucumbers, crumbled cheese, sour cream and guacamole.  I give this place 4 stars because the bathrooms at this location are small and a little janky.  They have outdoor seating, which is nice.  A couple of the guys that have worked here for years recognize me and my family and greet us every time we go here.   A great, healthier alternative to the common "bertos."

Great food and the people are friendly.  Seems like a family affair which I like.  It looks like the place is newly re-decorated.  The kitchen and the dining area are very clean.  They have hit sauce in bottles if you dine in, which I really like.  The bean and cheese burrito is fantastic! They actually add some flavor ro their beans.  The potato egg and cheese is great also.  They use real potatoes instead of chopped up french fries.  The family lives this place and its a regular spot for us.  I would definitely give it a try.  Dont let the size of the place or location scare you off.

Great food finds a way to distract me from other things like service or atmosphere.  I have been here several times and the food is amazing.  The atmosphere is somewhat non-existent, the building is a little shabby and there isn't much in the decor category and you know what, I don't care.  It's divey, get over it.  But if you want great food unlike anything you find elsewhere, this is the spot.  The service is always great and friendly.  I've not been too many places where they will let you sample the different dishes before you buy them.  I love this because the fusion of Mexican and Asian is unlike anything else and it's great to be able to try it before you commit.    The ordering system is somewhat unorthodox but the employees are always willing to help you get exactly what you want.  My regular favorite is the jade red chicken, handgrenade chicken in a quesadilla, the black beans and the jerk-fried rice.  The best part is, the perfectly baked snicker doodle cookie they throw in.    I dont give 5 stars easily but this place is fast, fresh and full of flavor.  For that, they earn my vote.

The service is always amazing here!   Super friendly staff. Highly recommend the iced blended with no sugar added powder! Amazing!  Drive thru is quick and easy.  My favorite coffee place. I drive out of my way to visit. Once a month I tale my son to the orthodontist up the street. I leave the house early for my favorite drink!

Pizza is good, not spectacular.  I do like that they have the buffalo wing pizza, which I think is great.    Basic salad bar with your traditional toppings, most if which can be found on one of their pizza offerings.  Sometimes the lettuce has seen better days so I pick around it.    They have ample space to accommodate a larger party which is nice.  The girls working the counter are always friendly and energetic.    I've mostly been here during lunch hours and I have to  say that they have the system down because this place can get really busy.  They have great luch specials which is what seems to draw the crowd.    The place always seems clean and they do a standard job when it comes to keeping the salad bar stocked and clean.  Sometimes there is a bottleneck to get drink re-fills because the fountain is next to the silverware, napkins and salad bar but this is a minor inconvinience.    I have had their italian sub which I wouldn't order again, it just wasn't that great.    I would recommend the pizza to a friend and return to eat again.

Eh...whatever.  I mean it's Subway, what do you expect?  The service was okay.  Just like every other Subway, when I left I smelled like yeast and bread the rest of the day which I know sounds rediculous but it drives me crazy!  Subway is great if you want a sub with crappy bread, that may or may not be hard on the bottom, mediocre meat and cheese with basically unlimited veggies.  It is nice that you can add just about any topping for free.  This is the only edge Subway has on any of the other sub places.  Subway used to be one of the only chain style sub shops around but with all the new options I'm surprised they are still around.  They are my last choice for a sub, and I will only return if I'm in a pinch.

I enjoyed this spot for lunch.  They serve complimentary chips and salsa before the meal.  The chips were nice and warm and the salsa was fresh.  They served two types of salsa and a bean dip which was great as well.    I ordered the tri-colored enchiladas, one beef, one cheese and one chicken.  The shredded beef was great.  The red enchilada sauce was different than what I am used to.  It was not spicy at all but was flavorful and good.  The green enchilada sauce was a little tart.  It seemed to be more tomitillo based rather than green chili based.  The cheese enchilada was good also.  They used cojita cheese rather than a cheddar so it lacked in flavor somewhat.    The beans were great, they had a slight smokey flavor.  The service was very good and everyone was friendly.  I would love to go back when I can try the margaritas as they boast about how great they are.    All in all, a great local place with good food that isn't the same as everywhere else.

Some family was looking for specific boots for a wedding.  I can't  really comment about how pricey this place is because I've never shopped for cowboy style boots.  All the boots were arranged by size which was nice.  No one ever offered to help us when we walked in but they sure wanted to know if anyone helped us when it was time to check out.   The girl at the register, Christine, was rude and had an attitude.  I tried to joke a little to keep it light and she wasn't having any of it.  What was strange is this was the second Boot Barn we went to and the girl at the first store also had an attitude.  Maybe it was obvious to them that we aren't cowboys.  I don't think they appreciated my Pumas and my Vans hat.  Oh well....in the end he found what he wanted.  I'm just glad when I go and buy a pair of tennis shoes they don't size me up and expect me to swing a raquet.

So when you walk into this place you are met with a floor to ceiling block wall. To get near the bar you have to walk around the wall.  If you walk to the right you have to pass by the waitress/waiter station where they put their orders is.  If you walk to the left you have to squeeze by the bar station where all the waiters/waitresses are  picking up their drinks from the bar.    Its a big wide open space, which I don't necessarily mind but it is hard to get around all the tables to get anywhere.  We sat outside where there was nice patio furniture.  The down side was there were no TV's which is a must for a bar/grill.    I ordered two different tap beers while I was there and the glasses were warm.  The beer was not cold either.  I moved to a mixed drink, a long island, which is a pretty basic drink.  It was awful. I was able to send it back, without being charged, no questions asked.  I ordered a crown and sprite since they didn't have ginger ale, it was okay.   It tasted more like watered down crown, the balance was off.    For food a member of our party ordered the tackle box which appeared to be a sampler platter of fried appetizers.  It looked basic.  I ordered the chicken nachos.  They were dry and the cheese was cold when we got them.  There were a lot of chips with nothing on them.  The taco chips themselves were okay.  It came with a tiny side of salsa and sour cream which wouldn't have been near enough if all the nachos were actually eaten.  The salsa was actually very good.  The chicken was not shredded it was big cubes.  The chicken was bland and not seasoned and tasted like it was boiled.   The service as great.  We had a big party and the server did a great job of meeting our needs.  We ordered a shot later in the night,  Rumchata and Fireball which actually tasted great.   I will not be returning.  Bar/grill restaurants like this are a dime a dozen.  They have to step up their game and I speculate it was so busy because of the location.  Below average joint gets two stars.

I didn't feel it was fair to give this place only one star without actually going inside as atmosphere/cleanliness is one of the categories I like to rate on. I had a positive drive through experience.  The service was prompt and friendly.    I was surprised when I tried to order a diet soda and they told me they don't have diet anymore.    I ordered the Carne asada burrito.  The size was somewhat small compared to many other places.  The tortilla was dried out and split on me while I was eating the burrito.  It looked and tasted like it had been frozen at one time.  The Carne asada was a little salty.  I had to constantly spit out pieces of gristle and fat as I was eating.  It was the worst Carne asada I've ever had.  There was very little guacamole and the pico was non-existent.    For a burritothat size that cost over $7 I would expect a much better quality meat.  I was very dissapointed and will not return.

This is my go-to breakfast spot every year on Fremont Street.  They have a decent menu selection and prompt service.    I have the corned beef hash and eggs.  They cook the eggs a perfect over-medium, which is harder to get that you may think.  The corned beef hash is straight from a can, which is the only way as far as I'm concerned.  The hash browns could use a little seasoning but otherwise they are great!  They are thick enough of a shred that they retain moisture when they're cooked and they don't dry out.  The coffee is on the weak side, which is fine for me since I'm not really a die hard drinker. The food came out very fast and the prices were reasonable.    Friends had the french toast which they said was great.   Served with real whipped butter and not margerine.     Always consistent and fast, the perfect combination for a Vegas breakfast.

So the first time I went here I really didn't like the food.  I have been several times since then because of friends.  Since then, I have had great experiences.  I will agree that most of the food is standard bar fare, most of which is probably frozen.  I tried their potato skin appetizer based on a recommendation from a friend.  They were amazing!  The best skins I have had so far anywhere.  The potato to cheese ratio was on point.  They were dressed with scallions and real bacon pieces.  They had this sour cream based sauce on top that sealed the deal.  The sauce definitely had a kick but it made them completely unique and delicious.  The bloody Marys are awesome as well.  Mixed perfectly with celery and olives.  The drought beer is always ice cold and the serve it in cold glasses, a must of course.    I have also had the buffalo chicken sandwich.  They use two large chicken tenders rather than a whole breast which I didn't really prefer.  The sauce was great and the chicken was well dressed.  The lettuce, tomato and onion was fresh and the pretzel bun was great.  On that note, I should mention that the soft pretzel appetizer is also great, one of my favorites.  They serve it with a great spicy mustard sauce and cheese.    The service is okay, nothing extraordinary.  The main female bartender that seems to be there mostly on the weekends is somewhat standoffish and not very attentive.  I   have had several other waitresses and they seem okay.    We sit mostly outdoors on the patio which is okay.  It seems to be mostly occupied by smokers which can get old but I understand they sit out there for a reason and I can move inside if I really wanted to.  They have three big TVs on the patio and always have sports going which is great.  They can be hard to see because of the sun glare but no biggie.    I would recommend it to a friend.  They have mostly standard bar food but they definitely have a few options you can't get too many other places.

This place is a hidden gem.  A buddy and I found this place on Yelp and liked how it was rated.  Surrounded by other larger and brighter restaurants in Market Square, I'm not sure we would have stopped in on our own but glad we did.  The first day we went we sat downstairs at the bar where we watched the food being prepared.  It was fun to interact with the cooks and staff as we waited for our meals.  We ordered the mojo fries, OG mac and cheese and a couple burgers to split.  The mac was outstanding.  The pasta was perfectly cooked.  The fries were fresh, well seasoned and perfectly cooked.    I ordered the "I don't care whatever" burger.  I had a slight misunderstanding with the waitress about how I wanted it cooked but she quickly resolved the issue and the cooks quickly made me a new burger.  All I can say is it's one of the best burgers I have ever had.  The meat was fresh and cooked perferctly.  The toppings we're diced small which lends to the eating experience; I got a mix of everything in each bite.  The had a good selection of craft beers.    After dinner we went upstairs and ordered a drink at the bar.  I wouldn't exactly call it a full bar but they do have a great selection of burbons and scotch.  They seem to specialize in Manhattens and Old Fashioneds.  I ordered Blanton's burbon on the rocks.  The bartender realized he didn't have enough so rather than giving me a weak pour, he gave me Four Roses Single Barrel at the lower Blanton's price!  Great customer service.  We loved this place so much we went back two nights later this time sitting upstairs.  We ordered the beer cheese fries which were great.  The beer cheese wasn't overly cheesey, it had a slight gravy flavor.  We also ordered the blue cheese and garlic mac and cheese.  If I were to be super picky this is where I would have my only complaint.  I expected more fresh garlic and the blue cheese they use is very mild and didn't really stand out from the regular cheese sauce.  I'm not sure it was worth the extra 5 or 6 dollars over the regular mac and cheese.  That being said it was still quality and tasted great.  I ordered the same burger I had before.  I don't give 5 stars easily but this place deserves it.  Anything this place lacks in size and space it more than makes up for in armosphere, food and customer service.

Best burger I have ever eaten.  Their NYPD burger is amazing and always cooked to perfection.  Fresh ingredients.  Its obvious that the cooks/chefs are trained.  Fresh cut french fries are seasoned.  Their breakfast is great as well.  One of the only places that cook over medium eggs perfectly every time.   I like that they are trying to bring the east coast atmosphere to Surprise.  They have a great meat and cheese selection that can be added to most dishes.  I also live their frequent diner program.  I have earned many free meals just by going back to eat at a place I love.  Great idea.

The reason I eat out is because I am willing to pay money for service and convinience.  Thus I will not be returning to this restauraunt.  Prior to going I had two different friends separately tell me this place was "awful" but I had to try it out anyway.    The service is terrible.  You order cafeteria style, which I don't mind, except for the crabby old lady taking my order and making me feel like she was doing me a favor by taking my money.  I felt like I was in line at the DMV, not a restaurant.    As I was ordering I observed some sketchy food preparation since the food prep area is open to all the customers.  Cracking eggs and dripping them on the same surface where they are buttering toast doesn't seem okay to me.  The best part was when one of the guys shoved the blade of the "toast knife" under the toaster.  I'm sure they clean under there all the time.....wow.    This place is very loud due to the wide open area and when busy it's difficult to hold a conversation.  The mustard and ketchup bottles were absolutely disgusting.  They were old and worn out and grimy.    The food was not good.  I ordered the chorizo burrito.  Most of the burrito was overcooked, unseasoned rice.  I am not a fan of huge chunks of green peppers and onions in my chorizo.  Also, they seemed to put an excessive amount of jalapeno pepper in it.    I am usually not too pickey when it comes to service or small attitudes from staff here and there because I understand they have a difficult job.  In this case it was too much to overlook.  You better have food I can't get anywhere else or make myself for me to put up with attitude like that!

As mentioned by another reviewer, this place is a great "all in one" spot for everyone from families to friends to single people wanting some nightlife.    We have been here several times.  They have laser tag and an arcade for the kids.  They have family bowling and private bar area bowling, pool tables, and a full bar/restaurant.  They even had a corn hole tournament going while we were there.    We showed up and we were told that there was a waiting list for bowling and the wait was about an hour.  This surprised me because there were a lot of empty lanes.  We went to the restaurant to get a bite to eat and were called for bowling about 15 minutes later which was a nice surprise.  Luckily I was able to catch the waiter and tell him we were leaving to bowl before he put our food order in.  I don't think it would have been a big deal though because I think all the food comes from this place anyway and they probably could have delivered it to our lane.    We got our shoes and lanes and started bowling.  They have music and TVs you can see while bowling.  We ordered food, which was from the same menu and selection as in the restaurant.  It would have been nice if the waiter at the restaurant told us we could have just kept our order in and they would deliver it to our lane since we were starving and had to wait twice as long, but no biggie.    The food was great!  A friend had a burger which was awesome.  The fires it came with were also great.  They had great seasoning.  I had pizza which was great also.  The pepperoni were large and flavorful.    This place isn't cheap but not as expensive as you would think to have someone wait on you at your lane while you're bowling.  This is a far cry from the typical bar food style bowling alley filled with smoke.  My only complaint is if you are a serious bowler it's a little messy.  Because they allow and even encourage people eating at the lane there was a lot of crumbs and food on the floor.  The approach was hideous obviously not clean so there was no glide whatsoever.  I didn't mind, because like I said you would have to be a serious bowler, but I could see how this would annoy those wanting to have a serious game.

I would give this place zero stars if I could.    We called Fast Med at 9 AM to verify how the "Zip Pass" works and we were advised that only emergency patients would be seen before us once we arrived which we were fine with of course.    We checked in online at about 9:15 for the next available time to be seen which was 11:15.  We killed two hours and showed up 10 minutes before our scheduled time.  The receptionist told us that it wasn't a hard fast appointment time which we also understood because we know they have other patients in the back already being seen.  Then she told us that everyone that was checked in already would be seen before us......huh?  That's when the wheels came off.  The waiting room was packed!  So we just killed two hours waiting for our scheduled time only to be told that everyone that has been checked in during those two hours will be seen before us?  Oh, but the good news was we got wait in an exam room instead of the waiting room.  Like that's some sort of privilege?  Has anyone ever waited for two hours in an exam room?  That's the worst.  I usually don't complain but this was ridiculous so I confronted the receptionist only to get the standard, "I'm sorry sir that's our protocol."  I just wanted her to stop and think for a second.  If we checked in online at 9:15 why are we not ahead of all these other people and what is the advantage to using the "Zip Pass?"  Her head was spinning and she finally confessed that this was the first time they had "Zip Pass" activated since she has worked there.  Obviously she has no clue how it works.  We would have been better off just driving straight there and waiting!  What's the point?  We took our ID and insurance card and walked out.  I would never give this place my business or money.    When we got home we called another location that also uses the Zip Pass to confirm how it works.  They confirmed that when you show up at your scheduled time, you immediately go back to the room and are the next patient to be seen after others who are already in exam rooms.    I understand that this place was busy and it was one of the only urgent cares open because it was a holiday but there is no excuse for this.  If the waiting room wasn't filled with sick children I would have made a scene.  Go to Nextcare.....

Tailgaters has become a regular place for my family and I.  This location has a great bar area, covered outdoor seating, a fairly large indoor dining area and good parking.    I have eaten several items off the menu and never been disappointed.  They make their own blue cheese and italian dressings which are great!  The pizza is awesome and always consistent.   You can order almost any of their sandwiches "baked" which is the way to go.  They put all of the sandwich ingredients in a pocket of pizza dough and bake it, they're awesome.   They have a really good selection of draft beers and it's always cold.  I really enjoy their "beer club card" program which seems to be somewhat an insider's secret since I never really see them advertise it.  If you plan on going to Tailgaters a lot ask them for a beer card.  The card has about 40 different beers, bothe tap and bottle, on it and several "chose your own" boxes.  If you drink all the beers they give you a free shirt and you get your name on the plaque.  It's a fun way to try different beers.    I give them 4 stars because they seem to have a fair ammount of turnover with the bartenders and servers which makes the service hit or miss.  They also have a ton of TV's but I have been there a few times to watch Suns games and they don't even have it on.  They always change the TV's when asked, so not that big of a deal but they definitely prefer to play music rather than the sound of some of the sporting events.  The bartenders are somewhat friendly but definitely seem to cater more to the regulars which seem to be the older, retiree age gentlemen.  I don't really mind since I don't sit at a bar by myself.  However, my wife and I have sat at the bar together quite often and no matter how many times we get the same bartender it's like she is seeing us for the first time.      I would, and have, recommend this place and bring friends or family here.

This place was pretty cool.  They had a huge bar area and spots where groups could sit together.  I have never seen so many beers in one place!  Literally hundreds of beers!  The most beers on tap I've ever seen anywhere.  They had glass door coolers lined up one after another all packed with bottled beers.  We only stayed for one beer and didn't eat but we had a positive experience.  Decent prices.  The bartender was friendly and attentive.  If you want a bar with a huge selection of bottled and draught beer, this is the place.

We love this place.  They always have a great selection of flavor and they seem to rotate them often so there is always something new.    The place looks and smells clean.  The staff is energetic and they always greet you when you walk in.  They do a great job of keeping the area where you select toppings clean and they are really good about making sure the toppings don't get mixed up when people are a little willy nilly with topping their yogurt.    They have a frequent buyer program which is nice because it gives you money off or even freebies.  They have the nutritional values posed conspicuously which is nice, or not depending on how much I eat!  We will continue to go back.

Man this place does it right!  They hit my three areas for a review right on the money every time; service, food, atmosphere.    I'm stoked that they have opened a couple more locations other than in the east valley.  I hate, hate ,hate waiting to eat, but for this place I make an exception.  It's worth the wait. I love to hit this place right around 2:00 or 3:00 and we walk right in and watch the dinner crowd line up as we finish up our meal.    The drinks are good, the beer is cold and everything I have ever ordered was great!  The cheesy garlic bread is a must have.  I also really enjoy the holy guacamole dish.  It's a huge cheesy tortilla with a hefty helping of guac, it's awesome.  My go-to entre is the alfredo-the dark with chicken.    The atmosphere is casual and energetic.  I love the quality of the servers.  It truly seems everyone loves working there.  It's always clean and the food is always consistent.   I'm amazed at how reasonable the prices are for the portion size and quality.    It's pretty simple, if you haven't been....go.  You won't regret it.

If you are into whiskeys this place is the spot to go.  They have an unbelievable selection.  The bar tenders were knowlegeable about what they had and were able to make recommendations.  I really dug the large clear ice cube they used for on the rocks.  We were attended to by Giuseppe.  He was friendly and made an amazing old fashioned.  He engaged in great conversation and made the bar experience a good one.   This place had the coolest atmosphere of any place I had been to in Pittsburg.  The bathrooms were clean.  They have a cool upstairs bar and neat little nooks where they have seating.    The prices were fair and I didn't feel like I was paying inflated prices for the selection.  I didn't eat so I can't speak on the food but the guys sitting next to me ordered steak and it looked and smelled amazing.    Overall I would definately go back and I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone.

We were in town for a convention and saw a lot of people were eating here so we figured we would give it a try.  The place was absolutely packed!  We tried to sit or even stand at the bar with no luck so the hostess offered us a table right away.    We were just stopping in for a quick bite and some beers.  We ordered the white truffle fries.  They were great!  They were fried perfectly and were crunchy but soft in the middle.  The flavor of the truffle was there but not overpowering.  The aoli they served with it tasted great too.    I saw they had a huge selection of beers, unfortunately they were out of all except 4 or 5.  That was a dissapointment.  I'm sure it was because of the conference and they didn't anticipate the increase in business.    Overall the atmosphere was cool.  They have a large patio area which is nice.  All the staff were friendly and didn't seem frazzled by how busy they were.  Overall a good experience.

My wife and I have made this a regular stop whenever we run some errands.  Let me begin by saying if you want a review about their extra bold, double roasted, black blah blah blah, stop reading cause I can't help you.  I always order their iced tea and my wife prefers the blended drinks.  Neither of us are coffee connoisseurs but we enjoy the friendly staff and laid back attitude.  I never realized how much I really hated Starbucks until I started comming here.  I dont need someone to correct the way I order my coffee drink.  "No whip" goes before the size duh!  Anyway, I like how even through the drive through I get to speak to a person and not a machine.  All the staff are friendly and like to spark up conversation while you wait which is a genius business tactic in my opinion.  If you don't want to engage in conversation with staff and just want to stick your face in a laptop without being bothered than go to Starbucks.    The tea is good and they have a wide variety of flavors you can add.  My wife swears buy the blended coffee drinks.  I'll be honest, I usually swipe a sip and they are delicious.  They have kid's sized smoothies which my boys love.   I really enjoy their frequent buyer cards.  You get a free drink after buying so many, I think it's 10.  It's obvious that the staff truly enjoy working for this company and it shows.  If you are friendly back and engage them in some good convo while you wait, sometimes they will throw you an extra stamp on your frequent buyer card!

I've been here several times and it's been the same every time.   The first problem is that they open at 7 during the week but they aren't actually ready to conduct business until 0730 or 0800.  We arrived at 0730 and the kitchen wasn't ready to actually cook food until around 0800 so we sat with our water and coffee for about 30 minutes.    The service is okay.  When I think 50's diner I imagine friendly and energetic staff.  The employees here seem under-prepared, under-trained and too distracted or overwhelmed to be energetic.  I had the pick three breakfast with eggs over-medium, bacon and toast.  The food came out quickly and the eggs were hot but the bacon was cold.  Everything is very greasy and my eggs were over-hard.  The toast appears to be cooked on the flat top rather than toasted in a toaster because it is covered in melted butter, of course it tasted great.  The other people I was with were served cold hash browns and a cold breakfast sandwich.   I have had the breakfast sandwich before which is good, but again, the bread is very greasy with butter.  I have also had the chorizo wrap.  I will agree with another reviewer that it was mostly under-cooked hash browns and the chorizo was bland.    The coffee is great but rarely plentiful and almost never ready at 0730.  I really want this place to succeed because I always like to support small businesses.  The decor is good and they play great music.  The place is always clean as well.  There are just a few things they can do that would really step up their game and not cost much.  Stop serving coffee and drinks in disposable cups.  Most people that sit down to eat want their coffee in a mug   They need to get organized and be ready for customers when they open.  Rather than spending time putting out all their signs and displays they should be attending to customers.    Get energized.  You have an up-beat joint that plays 50's music.  You are young employees and you need to be more energetic.   I feel like when I go here at 0730, the waiters/waitresses have just rolled out of bed.  I have a feeling that this place may be a different experience during lunch so I wouldn't be opposed to giving it another shot later in the day.

Always fast and always friendly.  The employees here have always made my sub quickly and correctly.  The delivery drivers actually run from the store and to their cars.    This place is always clean.  And the employees really do seem to work together which is refreshing to see.  I enjoy the signs that are on the walls and always see something new while I wait for my sub, which is on average is less than a minute.    If you want great subs that you can actually eat with one hand and you need to get in and out quickly, I would definatly recommend this joint.

AmAzInG!  After a long awaited donut store in the center of surprise, we spotted the  "Grand  Opening" sign, could or be? Star donuts is finally open! Our family of four entered & spotted am almost-empty donut case.  With hunger and disappointment, we waited in line, willing the case to fill. Out from the back emerged a donut God, armed with trays of fresh donuts that seemed to sparkle in the Saturday, Arizona sunlight. We made our way to the front, not turning away like the many defeated that left in disappointment. Alas! It was our turn! With a filed case we bought our share, 12 for our family, please. So worth the wait! Melt in your mouth, not too sweet, light and fluffy!  Our family will be back, no matter the wait.
